2500|$|The rapidly {{changing}} currents also create electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) that radiate {{outward from the}} ionic channel. This is a characteristic of all electrical discharges. The radiated pulses rapidly weaken as their distance from the origin increases. However, if they pass over conductive elements such as power lines, communication lines, or metallic pipes, they may induce a current which travels outward to its termination. This is the [...] "surge" [...] that, more often than not, results {{in the destruction of}} delicate electronics, electrical appliances, or electric motors. Devices known as surge protectors (SPD) or <b>transient</b> <b>voltage</b> surge suppressors (TVSS) attached in parallel with these lines can detect the lightning flash's transient irregular current, and, through an alteration of its physical properties, route the spike to an attached earthing ground, thereby protecting the equipment from damage.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{issues to be}} noted {{regarding}} behavior of <b>transient</b> <b>voltage</b> surge suppressors (TVSS) incorporating MOVs under over-voltage conditions. Depending {{on the level of}} conducted current, dissipated heat may be insufficient to cause failure, but may degrade the MOV device and reduce its life expectancy. If excessive current is conducted by a MOV, it may fail catastrophically, keeping the load connected, but now without any surge protection. [...] A user may have no indication when the surge suppressor has failed. Under the right conditions of over-voltage and line impedance, {{it may be possible to}} cause the MOV to burst into flames, the root cause of many fires and the main reason for NFPA’s concern resulting in UL1449 in 1986 and subsequent revisions in 1998 and 2009. Properly designed TVSS devices must not fail catastrophically, resulting in the opening of a thermal fuse or something equivalent that only disconnects MOV devices.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Decreased {{power supply}} levels {{have reduced the}} {{tolerance}} to voltage changes within power distribution networks in CMOS integrated circuits. High on-chip currents, required to charge and discharge large on-chip loads while operating at high frequencies, produce significant <b>transient</b> IR <b>voltage</b> drops within a power distribution network. These <b>transient</b> IR <b>voltage</b> drops can affect the propagation delay of a CMOS logic gate, creating delay uncertainty within data paths. Analytical expressions characterizing these <b>transient</b> IR <b>voltage</b> drops are presented in this paper. The peak value of these <b>transient</b> IR <b>voltage</b> drops is within 6 % as compared to SPICE. Circuit- and layout-level design constraints are also discussed to manage the peak value of the <b>transient</b> IR <b>voltage</b> drops. The propagation delay of a CMOS logic gate based on these analytical expressions is within 5 % of SPICE while the estimate without considering <b>transient</b> IR <b>voltage</b> drops can exceed 20 % for a 20 � power line.

5000|$|EG - An {{envelope}} generator is a <b>transient</b> <b>voltage</b> source. A trigger {{in the presence}} of a gate, applied to an Envelope Generator produces a single, shaped voltage.

It can be triggered by a keyboard or by another module in the system that produces a rapidly rising trigger {{in the presence of}} a gate. Usually it controls the amplitude of a VCA or the center frequency of a VCF, but the patchable structure of the synthesizer makes it possible to use the {{envelope generator}} to modulate other parameters such as the frequency or pulse width of the VCO.

40|$|The <b>transient</b> over <b>voltages</b> are {{generated}} in gas insulated substations (GIS) during switching operation of substations {{in the order}} of a few nanoseconds. These transients have traveling wave behavior and travel to external systems through discontinuities and interface such as enclosures, bushings, cable joints etc. Depending up on configuration of the GIS and the amplitude of the electric and magnetic fields could be of the order of a few tens of kilovolts per meter and a few hundreds of amps per meter respectively. These very fast <b>transient</b> over (VFTO) <b>voltages</b> create critical situations in protection circuit and control circuit and makes raise faults in cables, transformers and secondary circuits, which result in malfunctioning of the primary equipment.
