50|$|Similar to {{a ladder}} frame, but the middle {{sections}} of the frame rails sit outboard of {{the front and rear}} rails just behind the rocker / sill panels. This was done to allow for a lower floor pan, especially at the passenger footwells, to lower the passengers' seating height and therefore reduce the overall vehicle height in passenger cars. This became the prevalent design for body-on-frame cars in the United States, but not {{in the rest of the}} world, until the uni-body gained popularity. It allowed for annual model changes introduced in the 1950s to increase sales, but without costly structural changes. As of 2014, there are no <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> automobiles sold in the United States after the Ford Motor Company phased out the Panther platform in 2011, which ended the <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> passenger car in the United States (the Chevrolet Corvette has used a variation of the <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> since 1963, but its fourth generation variant to its current generation as of 2016 has elements of the <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> integrated with an internal endoskeleton which serves as a clamshell).|$|R
5000|$|A <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> {{which carries}} the above {{components}} {{but in addition}} supports the engine, transmission and possibly full suspension. (As used on front wheel drive cars) ...|$|R
50|$|The X-frame was {{claimed to}} improve on {{previous}} designs, but it lacked side rails and thus did not provide adequate side-impact and collision protection.This design was replaced by <b>perimeter</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R
50|$|A fixed {{skylight}} {{consists of}} a structural <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> supporting glazing infill (the light-transmitting portion, which is made primarily of glass or plastic). A fixed skylight is non-operable, meaning there is no ventilation.|$|R
40|$|Today, tall {{buildings}} are generally built {{with a central}} core that transfers the loads down to the ground. The central core takes up {{a large part of}} the floor space and there is less room for the actual purpose of the building, such as offices and apartments. The consequence of this is also less rental profit. At a certain height of the building, the central core will not alone manage to keep the building stable. Therefore it needs to be connected with outriggers to withstand the horizontal forces. The Tubed Mega Frame system developed by Tyréns is designed without the central core and the purpose is to transfer all the loads to the ground via the perimeter of building, making the structure more stable since the lever arm between the loads is maximized. The system has not yet been used in reality. This thesis aimed at testing the efficiency of the Tubed Mega Frame system against conventional systems for {{tall buildings}}. Two different types of the Tubed Mega Frame system were evaluated; TMF <b>Perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> and TMF Mega columns. To begin with, a pre-study was carried out with the purpose of comparing wind deflections and eigenmodes of several conventional systems and Tubed Mega Frame systems. The buildings were modeled in the finite element software ETABS. The Core, outrigger and <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> system performed best compared to the other conventional systems and was therefore chosen as the conventional system to be tested in the main study. A comparison of the Core, outrigger and <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> system and eight different configurations of Tubed Mega Frame systems was carried out for several different building heights as a main study, based on the tall building 432 Park Avenue, New York. The deformations due to wind and seismic loading and eigenmodes were compared. Furthermore, the models were controlled for tension at the base and Pdelta convergence. Overall the TMF <b>Perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> systems had the smallest deflections as the building height was increased and could be increased the most without reaching tension at the base. As the top story height of the buildings was increased, the Tubed Mega Frame systems outperformed the conventional system. For the TMF <b>Perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> system it could be seen that belt walls were more efficient than cross walls, and for the TMF Mega columns the smaller the distance between the belt or cross wall levels was, the less deflection was achieved. The Core, outrigger and <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> system could be increased to 859 m in height before collapse and the Tubed Mega Frame system that performed best – TMF: <b>Perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> single story belt walls – was increased to 1024 m in height until divergence was achieved...|$|R
50|$|On <b>perimeter</b> <b>frames,</b> {{the areas}} where the rails connect from front to center and center to rear are weak {{compared}} to regular frames, so that section is boxed in, creating {{what is known as}} torque boxes.|$|R
5000|$|While most sport bikes use an {{aluminum}} <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame,</b> the ZX-12R uses a unique monocoque aluminum frame. The very {{first use of}} this type of frame on a mass produced production motorcycle. [...] This design surpasses the level of chassis strength and stiffness associated with conventional aluminum <b>perimeter</b> <b>frames.</b> Its intention was to make the bike narrower, and there by more aerodynamic. The design saves space by housing the battery and incorporating an efficient airbox and a cartridge-type air filter that easily slides into the frame. It was fuel injected with four Mikuni 46 mm throttle bodies and was Kawasaki's first fuel-injected sport bike since the 1981-1985 GPZ1100.|$|R
2500|$|The RZV500 {{was one of}} {{the first}} [...] "repli-racers", a near copy of Kenny Roberts {{competition}} GP bike, it featured a liquid-cooled two-stroke motor of 500cc displacement in a V4 configuration, along with a <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> and full fairing.|$|R
5000|$|Technically, the 3200 CS {{was the end}} of an era. It was {{the last}} of BMW's early postwar luxury cars. [...] As such, it was the last BMW {{automobile}} to have pushrod-operated engine valves, a <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame,</b> or a solid rear axle.|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} {{is widely used}} {{in the manufacture of}} engine cradles. The first mass-produced one was for the Ford Contour and Mystique in 1994. Others from a long list include the Pontiac Aztek, the Honda Accord and the <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> around the Harley Davidson V-Rod motorcycle's engine.|$|R
40|$|Structural {{characteristics}} of standard steel office buildings are investigated. Buildings are designed in {{two types of}} lateral resisting systems, which are space frame system (SFS) and <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> system (PFS). Moment resisting connections are used in most of beam-column connections in SFS, where the columns are typically square hollow structural sections subject to bi-axial bending moment under lateral forces. Contrarily, the moment resisting connections are limitedly used in the <b>perimeter</b> <b>frames</b> in PFS, where the columns are I-shaped sections and simple connections are used for beams connecting perpendicular to the lateral frames. Steel quantity is minimized under allowable stress design constraints. The design variables are the section sizes. It is found that the total steel quantity and welding length of PFS are smaller than those of SFS in four, seven and ten-story standard office buildings...|$|R
5000|$|The Y-Body has a rear-wheel drive, front-engined V8 layout, {{accommodating}} {{either a}} small block Chevrolet V8 (such as an LT4 or LS1) in the Corvette, or the 32-valve DOHC Northstar V8 in the XLR. The Y-Body also has 4-wheel independent suspension. Like a standard rear-wheel drive, front-engined chassis, the Y-Body's V8 engine is longitudinally mounted, but unlike many such cars, the Y-Body incorporates a rear-mounted transaxle (1997-present) {{instead of a}} transmission mounted directly to the engine. Power is transferred to the transaxle via a torque tube. The transaxle is offered in both 4/5/6/8-speed automatic versions and 6 and 7-speed manual versions. As of 2015 the Y platform is considered as the sole <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> automobile in production (the <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> has an integrated endoskeleton {{which serves as a}} safety cage).|$|R
2500|$|The 501 was an all-new platform, with a <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame,</b> double A-arm front {{suspension}} with {{torsion bar}} springs, and a live axle with torsion bar springs at the rear. [...] The steering mechanism {{was similar to}} a rack and pinion system except that the rack was semi-circular instead of straight.|$|R
50|$|The Pilot shares its {{platform}} with the Acura MDX, {{as well as}} the Odyssey minivan and the Accord sedan. The Pilot’s unibody construction and independent suspension is designed to provide handling similar to that of a car and has integrated <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> rails to allow towing and light off-road use.|$|R
50|$|The Bajaj Pulsar 200NS is {{a sports}} bike made by Bajaj Auto. The NS stands for Naked Sport. The Pulsar 200NS has a single-cylinder, four-stroke, triple {{spark-ignition}} & liquid-cooled engine. It uses a pressed steel <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> {{and a box}} section swingarm, an underbelly exhaust, and rear nitrox-charged mono-shock suspension.|$|R

5000|$|Fischer Motor Company is a US-based sport {{motorcycle}} manufacturer. Their MRX 650 is a sport bike {{built around}} a 90-degree V-twin engine and a one-piece, twin spar, aluminum <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame.</b> Alan Cathcart of Motorcyclist magazine in his 2006 test review, called the MRX, [...] "the most important new American motorcycle in generations." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{hollow steel}} <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> {{is used to}} reduce size and cost as well as improve comfort. Achieving the same {{strength}} with aluminum would require much larger frame spars making the frame much wider (and less comfortable). The hollow steel frame allows leg reliefs which are blended into {{the contours of the}} tank and bodywork.|$|R
50|$|The Honda VF750F V45 Interceptor aka RC15 (Honda's {{internal}} racing code) is {{a sports}} motorcycle produced by Honda from 1983 to 1985. Using a revised engine from the Sabre/Magna with chain drive and a five-speed gearbox the half-faired motorcycle was introduced with an 86-horsepower liquid-cooled double overhead cam (DOHC) V4 four-stroke engine in a steel <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R
50|$|The design {{had several}} unusual features, {{including}} a friction drive transmission, and a low-slung <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> chassis that {{was closer to}} those found on contemporary cars than other motorcycles. It also featured the first production example of hub-center steering on a motorcycle. The low-slung frame, front suspension, hub-center steering, and long wheelbase contributed to the cycle's exceptional stability.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to a lowered roof, the <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> allows lower seating positions when that is desirable, and offers better safety {{in the event of}} a side impact. However, the design lacks stiffness, because the transition areas from front to center and center to rear reduce beam and torsional resistance, hence the use of torque boxes, and soft suspension settings.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{modification}} of the <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame,</b> or of the backbone frame, in which the passenger compartment floor, and sometimes also the luggage compartment floor have been integrated into the frame as loadbearing parts, for extra strength and rigidity. Neither floor pieces are simply sheet metal straight off the roll, but have been stamped with ridges and hollows for extra strength.|$|R
5000|$|Redesigned in 1965, the Impala set {{an all-time}} {{industry}} annual sales record {{of more than}} 1 million units in the US. All new full-size Chevrolets eschewed the [...] "X" [...] frame for a full-width <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame,</b> a new body that featured curved, frameless side glass (for pillarless models), sharper angled windshield with newly reshaped vent windows, and redesigned full-coil suspension.|$|R
30|$|<b>Perimeter</b> <b>frames</b> of any {{building}} {{are exposed}} to highest risk of occurrence of any undesired event due to ease of accessibility. Therefore, the prototype of test specimens {{is assumed to be}} located at the middle of the <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> in longer direction subjected to column loss at bottom storey as shown in Fig.  1. Dimensional analysis has been carried out to establish sizes of specimen. Three 1 / 3 rd scaled precast specimens with different connection detailing and one 1 / 3 rd scaled monolithic specimen are designed and tested under a column removal scenario. Each specimen contains two span beam and three columns with removed middle column. Removed middle column represents the progressive collapse scenario. Design and detailing of specimens having monolithic and precast connections are carried out by following the design provisions of relevant Indian Standards (IS: 456, 2000, IS: 1893, 2002, IS: 13920, 2003) and British Standards (BS: 8110 - 1, 1997).|$|R
50|$|As usual Fleetwood {{exterior}} {{trim and}} interior appointments enriched the Series 75 in 1966. The first major redesign since 1961 featured a full <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame.</b> The new look brought {{the appearance of}} the big sedan and limousine up-to-date so that it matched the visual impression of other Cadillac lines. A big jump in sales for both regular production models, but not the commercial chassis, was the result.|$|R
50|$|Its <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> was of ladder {{form with}} a central spine between the {{transmission}} and the crossmember at the kick-up ahead of the rear wheels. The crossmember under the front seat was of box form, but all the other six, unusually, were made of tubing (with that at the transmission augmented by box members). A Mark II chassis was used to create the Lincoln Futura concept car.|$|R
5000|$|The 1961 {{full-sized}} Pontiacs {{were completely}} restyled with more squared-off bodylines, the reintroduction of the split grille first seen in 1959 and dropped for 1960 and an all-new Torque-Box <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> with side rails replacing the [...] "X" [...] frame chassis used since 1958. The new frame not only provides greater side-impact protection than the [...] "X" [...] design but also improves interior roominess.|$|R
2500|$|A {{more popular}} and {{practical}} high-performance {{model for the}} street was introduced in 1985, the FZ750. It was an innovative 750cc four-stroke inline four cylinder model. It was the first motorcycle to feature a five valve cylinder head, something Yamaha became well known for. [...] It also featured a cylinder block canted forward at 45 degrees, and a box-section steel <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame.</b> [...] Production of the FZ continued until 1991.|$|R
5000|$|... "SV" [...] {{stands for}} safety vehicle, and Bricklin applied {{standards}} {{far ahead of}} anything the US government was imposing in the 1970s. The car exceeded US crash protection standards. It protected occupants with a tubular steel <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> and roll cage and a chassis capable of withstanding a high velocity impact without deformation - and {{did not include a}} cigarette lighter or ashtray, as Bricklin viewed smoking while driving as unsafe) ...|$|R
50|$|Springfree Trampoline has {{successfully}} removed the 3 major impact zones: steel frame, springs and the ground. The Springfree trampoline uses rods {{to form a}} flexible soft edge resulting in the rigid frame being lowered around 450mm below the jumping surface. This removes two known hazards from the jumping surface - the rigid <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> and the steel coil springs. The base of the trampoline is also more rigid than conventional trampolines.|$|R
5000|$|After deliberation, the {{management}} rejected Bonsch's proposal and instead ordered chief engineer Fritz Fiedler to commission Bertone {{to design and}} manufacture a coupe body for the 3200S. [...] This used a <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame,</b> a , twin-carburetor version of the BMW OHV V8 engine, delivering , [...] a four speed manual gear box, a live rear axle, disc brakes on the front wheels, and torsion bar springs at all four wheels.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} commonly {{designed as}} the softly curving glass skin integrates eight sloping megacolumns that follow a lyrical line connecting the centers and corners {{of all four}} elevations. These curving megacolumns increase the structure’s response to seismic concerns and are integral to both the gravity and lateral systems. They are effective in increasing the stiffness of the building’s <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame,</b> consequently attracting a larger portion of the seismic forces {{in compliance with the}} Chinese code requirements.|$|R
50|$|The new {{intermediate}} F-85 now rode {{a conventional}} body-on-frame chassis with a <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame.</b> Wheelbase grew to 115 in, overall length to 203 in, and weight {{by more than}} 300 lb. Both the aluminum V8 and the Roto Hydramatic were discontinued {{in favor of a}} new cast-iron small-block V8 of 330 cu. in. (5.4L) displacement and an optional two-speed Jetaway automatic transmission with variable-pitch stator. Buick's 225 cu. in. (3.7 L) V6 was the standard engine.|$|R
50|$|The A-body {{platform}} was reintroduced as an intermediate-sized platform {{introduced in}} the 1964 model year for the all-new mid-sized cars of four GM divisions. Notable examples include the FR layout Chevrolet Chevelle, Buick Special, Oldsmobile Cutlass and Pontiac Tempest. The A-body cars were the first intermediate-sized cars designed with a full <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame</b> and four-link coil-spring rear suspension, similar to that introduced on full-sized Pontiacs and Oldsmobiles in 1961 and on all other GM full-sized cars in 1965.|$|R
