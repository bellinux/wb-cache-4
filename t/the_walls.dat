5|$|Although some in {{the front}} of the Mexican ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> Texians were forced to lean over <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the Mexican ladders reached <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found it increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E
5|$|In February 1832 Etty began a {{campaign}} of writing to local York newspapers urging the preservation of <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> and sending donations to various campaigns associated with their retention. Although some local newspapers were now supporting preservation {{in light of the}} damage their demolition would do to the tourist trade, many locals—whose lives were made more difficult by living in a walled city with few points of entry—remained hostile to the preservation campaigns. A proposal in 1838 by the York and North Midland Railway to cut an archway through <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> to allow access to a railway station within <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> galvanised Etty, and he delivered two lectures on the preservation of <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> during visits to York in 1838–39, and made four paintings of the Bars. Etty's words went unheeded and the archway was duly cut in <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> much to his dismay, although the station was soon moved to its current location outside <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> to allow through the running of trains to both north and south. While <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were eventually saved in 1889, many years after Etty's death, Etty is sometimes credited with their salvation. It is open to debate how significant his part was. Some authors feel that his interventions had no impact and the preservation of <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> was the result of decisions made by the Corporation and lobbying by local newspapers, while others feel that the Corporation would not have made these decisions had Etty and other like-minded dignitaries not put pressure on them to do so.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{a report}} on the quality of <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> around 1460 noted that on the north and east sides of Southampton, <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were still too thin to block a cannon shot or for a man to stand on them; a wood and earth wall-walk had been built behind <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> but this was proving very {{expensive}} to maintain. This contemporary assessment of the weakness of the eastern walls has been confirmed by modern archaeological excavation – in places it was only 0.76 m (2.49 feet) thick, compared to a typical thickness in other English town walls of around 1 m (3.28 feet).|$|E

5|$|Southampton's town walls {{remained}} an important defensive feature during the 15th century, the gatehouses sometimes {{being used as}} important civic facilities, including acting as the town's guildhall and housing the town's gaol. From {{the end of the}} 17th century their importance steadily declined and <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were slowly demolished or adapted for other uses throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.

50|$|<b>The</b> outfield <b>wall</b> or outfield {{fence is}} <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> or fence {{that marks the}} outer {{boundary}} of the outfield. A ball passing over <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> is dead; if it passes over <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> in fair territory while in flight, it is a home run. The official rules do not specify the shape, height, or composition of <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> or a specific mandatory distance from home plate (though Major League Baseball mandates a minimum distance of 250 ft and recommends a minimum distance of 320 ft at the foul poles and 400 ft at center field). As a result, baseball fields can vary greatly along those lines. <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> has numbers affixed or painted on it that denote the distance in feet {{from that point on}} <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> to home plate. In most modern major league ballparks, <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> is made of some hard material (e.g., concrete) with padding on the field side to protect players who may collide with <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> at high speed while trying to make a play. Chain link fencing may also be incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> in areas where <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> needs to be transparent, e.g., an outfield bullpen, a spectator area behind <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> or to protect a scoreboard incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Many ballparks feature a yellow line denoting the top of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> to aid umpires in judging whether the ball passed over <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> or if <b>the</b> ball is fair or foul.|$|R
5|$|A {{distinct}} feature {{noted in}} the entire temple complex is the stucco style embellishments built with brick masonry and finished with plaster.

5|$|Although {{financial}} {{help from the}} English was not forthcoming, Ferdinand could not break the defenses. On 28 November, ten days after {{the beginning of the}} siege, artillery fire had wasted several thousand pounds of powder in the ineffectual bombardment. Ferdinand moved his cannons to an elevated position in a hillside vineyard {{to the west of the}} Godesburg. The height offered a more advantageous trajectory with which to fire on <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of the Godesburg's outer ward. Within a few hours, his cannonade had breached them. Ferdinand sent three Italian experts to examine the breach and to advise him on the next step; the Italians, having come under fire during their examination, concluded that storming the castle would incur many casualties. The defenders still had the advantage of height and would be able to shoot at attackers from multiple towers and defensive positions inside <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> Ferdinand decided not to pursue this tactic. Unable to storm the castle, Ferdinand considered two options: abandon the siege, which he could not do, or blow up the fortress. This option of last resort usually made a fortress unusable. Furthermore while he considered his options, the defenders repaired the breaches caused by the cannonade and reinforced <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> making them even stronger than they had been. The defenders also removed the roof of the St. Michael's Chapel in the castle's outer ward, filled the chapel with dirt to reinforce its walls, and placed some of their artillery pieces within <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{change in}} the 1370s was the {{formalisation}} {{of the process of}} guarding and maintaining <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> During the invasion scare of 1377, Edward instructed the mayor to review these processes; it appears that the four wards of the town were surveyed, and each property was assigned a piece of the wall to maintain, varying according {{to the size of the}} property.

50|$|The primary {{geotechnical}} {{concern in}} design and installation of retaining <b>walls</b> is that <b>the</b> weight of the retained material is creates lateral earth pressure behind <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> which can cause <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> to deform or fail. The lateral earth pressure depends on the height of <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>the</b> density of the soil,the strength of the soil, {{and the amount of}} allowable movement of <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> This pressure is smallest at the top and increases toward the bottom {{in a manner similar to}} hydraulic pressure, and tends to push <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> away from <b>the</b> backfill. Groundwater behind <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> that is not dissipated by a drainage system causes an additional horizontal hydraulic pressure on <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|R

5|$|Around 1800, Caernarfon's local {{corporation}} {{undertook a}} programme of modernisation work, inserting several new gateways {{in the town}} walls; other changes were also made to <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> during the period, with some towers being converted for use as administrative buildings and the gatehouses altered to accommodate more modern offices. During the 19th century the town of Caernarfon grew considerably, prompted by the slate trade {{and the construction of}} the Chester to Holyhead railway line. As a result of this population pressure, by the 20th century housing had encroached along the inside and outside of the town walls, so that in many places <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> had vanished from view.

50|$|<b>The</b> Great <b>Wall</b> of Saskatchewan is {{a project}} created by Albert Johnson. <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> is located {{approximately}} 1.6 km west of the Village of Smiley, Saskatchewan on Highway 772. Construction started in 1962 when Albert started arranging stones {{in the form of}} a wall. As stones were cleaned off the surrounding farmland Albert would add them to <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> This continued clear until 1991. As the stones were transported to <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> they were placed so that <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> would support itself without the use of cement or mortar. The outer layer stones are specially shaped stones, that have been tapered inward in order to prevent <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> from moving. <b>The</b> interior of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> is filled with small and odd shaped stones. During construction of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> spruce trees were added alongside <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> for wind protection.

5|$|By {{the time}} of the Minster fire, the Corporation of York (the body {{responsible}} for local government) was already engaged in a debate {{about the future of the}} city's defensive walls. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> no longer served any practical purpose and were expensive to maintain, and with the population of the city rising rapidly the city was becoming cramped and dangerous. The city gates ("Bars") had become a public health hazard given the number of locals using them as toilets, and theft of stone for other building works had left parts of <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> dangerously unstable. The Bars restricted stagecoaches, meaning York was unable to capitalise on its strategic position halfway along the lucrative London–Edinburgh route. Faced with the need to clear the city's slums, in 1800 the Corporation sought permission from Parliament to demolish the Bars and much of <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> Owing to opposition from York Minster the scheme was abandoned, but by 1826 the barbicans of four of the gates had been demolished. In the face of this a public campaign to save <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> was launched in 1824, but attention on both sides of the debate was diverted by the Minster fire. In 1828 Etty had written to his mother expressing horror at the demolition proposals, but distracted by the need to complete Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs was unable to take any action himself. By 1831 the Corporation had decided to demolish the barbicans but to retain and restore <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E
