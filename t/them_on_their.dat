As Roy enters the mothership, one of the aliens pauses {{for a few moments}} with the humans. Lacombe uses Curwen hand signs that {{correspond}} to the five-note alien tonal phrase. The alien replies with the same gestures, smiles, and returns to its ship, which ascends into space, as Barry bids Roy goodbye.|$|E
5|$|Brown sat {{his players}} down in {{classrooms}} and relentlessly tested <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> {{knowledge of the}} playbook, requiring them to copy down every play in a separate notebook for better retention. He was a terse man, and his criticisms of players were often withering and ruthless. He prohibited players from drinking, {{told them not to}} smoke in public and made coats and ties mandatory on road trips. They were not to have sex after Tuesday night during the season.|$|E
5|$|Egyptologists {{have noted}} that instead of hiding their non-royal origins, Neferhotep I, his {{predecessor}} Sobekhotep III, and his successor Sobekhotep IV, remarkably proclaimed <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> stelae and scarab seals. This {{is at odds with}} the traditional Egyptian system where the legitimacy of the new king rests mainly on his filiation. These proclamations of non-royal origins were possibly made to dissociate these kings from their immediate predecessors, in particular Seth Meribre whose monuments have been usurped and defaced. The reason for this remains unknown.|$|E

5|$|In general, ticks are to {{be found}} {{wherever}} their host species occur. Migrating birds carry ticks with <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> journeys; a study of migratory birds passing through Egypt found more than half the bird species examined were carrying ticks. The species of tick often differed between the autumn and spring migrations, probably because of the seasonal periodicities of the different species.|$|E
5|$|In the game, Mario {{is portrayed}} as an Italian-American plumber who, along with his younger brother Luigi, has to defeat creatures that have been coming from the sewers below New York City. The {{gameplay}} focuses on Mario's extermination of them by flipping <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> backs and kicking them away. The original versions of Mario Bros.—the arcade version and the Family Computer/Nintendo Entertainment System (FC/NES) version—were received positively by critics.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} sea anemone species are {{commensal}} with other organisms. Certain crabs and hermit crabs seek out sea anemones and place <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> shells for protection, and fish, shrimps and crabs live among the anemone's tentacles, gaining protection {{by being in}} close proximity to the stinging cells. Some amphipods live inside the coelenteron of the sea anemone. Despite their venomous cells, sea anemones are eaten by fish, starfish, worms, sea spiders and molluscs. The sea slug Aeolidia papillosa feeds on the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), accumulating the nematocysts for its own protection.|$|E

The gang leader contacts the undercover Southern and Erdman operatives Dempsey and Kenyon at Glen Carrick Castle in the Scottish Highlands, and briefs <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> mission. The trio are {{to drive to the}} Nuclear Plutonium Store, where isotopes for all Britain's power stations are housed, and plant explosives to detonate at 12:30p.m.; this will cause a nuclear explosion of unprecedented scale and devastate half of England. To ensure compliance, the charges, which have already been armed, are contained in wrist bracelets identical to Prescott's and are to be unlocked on retrieval of the key at the Plutonium Store.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Hobbits’ fears, Faramir {{was wise}} {{enough to realize that}} such a weapon was not to be used and if desired, should be resisted.

Giving the Hobbits provisions, he sent <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way to continue their quest, but warned Frodo that their guide, Gollum, was a treacherous creature, and that an unknown terror lived in Cirith Ungol, where Gollum was leading them.|$|E
5|$|Gary and Veronica Cooper's daughter, Maria Veronica Cooper, {{was born}} on September 15, 1937. By all accounts, he was a patient and affectionate father, {{teaching}} Maria to ride a bicycle, play tennis, ski, and ride horses. Sharing many of her parents' interests, she accompanied <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> travels and was often photographed with them. Like her father, she developed a love for art and drawing. As a family they vacationed together in Sun Valley, Idaho, spent time at Rocky's parents' country house in Southampton, New York, and took frequent trips to Europe. Cooper and Rocky were legally separated on May 16, 1951, when Cooper moved out of their home. For over two years, they maintained a fragile and uneasy family life with their daughter. Cooper moved back into their home in November 1953, and their formal reconciliation occurred in February 1954.|$|E

5|$|Hayley Dee Westenra (born 10 April 1987) is a New Zealand singer, {{classical}} crossover artist, songwriter, and UNICEF Ambassador. Her first internationally released album, Pure, reached No.1 on the UK classical {{charts in}} 2003 and {{has sold more}} than two million copies worldwide.

In August 2006, she joined the Irish group Celtic Woman, was featured on their Celtic Woman: A New Journey CD and DVD, toured with <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> 2007 Spring Tour, and was also featured on their DVD, The Greatest Journey: Essential Collection, released in 2008. Westenra has produced five New Zealand number one studio albums, holding the title for the most number one records for any New Zealand act, a record shared with alternative rock band Shihad since the release of their 2014 album, FVEY.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, Geen was {{approached}} by Barbarian F.C., an invitational touring rugby team based in England, to join <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> 1911 Easter tour. Geen played in two matches of the tour, the first a 15–8 loss against Cardiff RFC where he was captained by Ireland's Tommy Smyth. Despite missing the Swansea game two days later, Geen returned to the Barbarians squad to face Cheltenham, which ended in a 8–3 victory for the tourists. Later that year Geen was again invited {{to play for the}} Barbarians, another contest against Cardiff in their traditional Boxing Day encounter. In 1912 Geen played in his first Barbarians match outside Wales, facing the Leicester Tigers. His captain on that day was England international Edgar Mobbs, and although finishing on the losing side, Geen scored his first and only try for the Barbarians.|$|E

More recently, changes in agricultural practices and better surveillance of locations where swarms tend to originate, have meant that control measures can be used at an early stage. The traditional means of control {{are based on the}} use of insecticides from the ground or the air, but other methods using biological control are proving effective.|$|E

5|$|The Scottish Football Union (SFU), the {{governing}} body for rugby union in Scotland, {{did not give}} the New Zealanders an official welcome, and sent only one official to greet <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> arrival in Edinburgh. In addition, the SFU refused a financial guarantee for the match, promising the gate receipts to the New Zealanders instead; {{this meant that the}} NZRFU had to take on all monetary responsibilities for the match. One reason for the cold reception from the SFU may have been because of negative reports from David Bedell-Sivright, who was Scotland's captain and had also captained the British Isles team on their 1904 tour of New Zealand. Bedell-Sivright had reported unfavourably on his experiences in New Zealand the previous year, especially regarding the wing-forward play of Gallaher.|$|E
5|$|The Seleucids {{sued for}} peace and began {{settling}} it with Scipio Asiaticus. In spring, the new consul, Gnaeus Manlius Vulso, arrived {{to take control of}} the army from Scipio Asiaticus. He was sent to conclude the treaty that Scipio was arranging. However, he was not content with the task given to him and he started to plan a new war. He addressed the soldiers and congratulated <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> victory and then proposed a new war, against the Galatian Gauls of Asia Minor. The pretext he used for the invasion was that the Galatians had supplied soldiers to the Seleucid army at the Battle of Magnesia. The principal reason for the invasion was Manlius' desire to seize the wealth of the Galatians, who had become rich from plundering their neighbours, and to gain glory for himself.|$|E

On a visit to Potsdam with Prince Charles of Prussia, Kalākaua was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Red Eagle.
