The Australian Olympic Committee unsuccessfully tried to have the Brazilian bobsleigh team thrown out due to <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> by Armando dos Santos, so that Australia would take its place. Hannah Campbell-Pegg came 23rd in luge, and Michelle Steele, a beach flag sprinter chosen from a systematic program to identify a potential skeleton medal-winner from female non-winter athletes, came 13th due to inexperience with the intimidating and technical track. Shaun Boyle represented Australia in the men's skeleton and placed 22nd. In 2010, Australia were represented in every bobsled event, but all finished last, failed to finish due to crashes or had to withdraw due to injuries sustained in earlier races. Australia's sole luger and two male skeleton racers came in the bottom 20%, while Emma Lincoln-Smith and Melissa Hoar came 10th and 12th respectively. Until 2010, Australia had placed in {{the bottom half of}} the field in every sliding event it has entered, and came last in the luge in 1994.

There also settle away from military of police stations. Meetings are generally held in places with good reputation and in buildings that offer several access points, with heavy precautions being taken to reach their locations untailed. If different units are meeting, commandoes are instructed to place hoods or masks and use codenames in order to protect their identities, both to accomplish plausible denial and to root out any law enforcement plant. Information is segregated between groups and only shared in limited detail, when necessary. Incriminating or detailed documents or any other evidence is to be destroyed once the potential of a law enforcement intervention is apparent. While involved in a particular mission, the EPB commandoes regularly assume a faux name, but they usually use this to acquire legitimate documents and select a nondescript address in which to receive mail in a fashion that prevents surveillance, such a P.O. Box or an decoy address where mail is delivered to the community in general. Even ammunitions were given codes such as Manteca for firearms or Libretas for explosives to conceal their nature. Armories were specifically retrofitted to preserve the condition and to prepare new ammunition as needed. Funds are managed strictly and reports are constant in order to keep a balanced budget.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} the {{background}} to this proposed legislation, looking at {{the development of the}} relevant statutory law, along with the debate about <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> sniffer dogs. On 19 September 2012 the NSW Attorney General, Greg Smith, introduced into the Legislative Assembly a Bill to extend <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> detection or "sniffer" dogs without warrant in Kings Cross and on CityRail lines - the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Amendment (Kings Cross and Railway Drug Detection) Bill 2012 [the 2012 Bill]. As explained in the explanatory note, the object of the Bill: is to authorise <b>the</b> <b>use</b> by police officers of dogs for general drug detection (without warrant) on the streets and other public places in the Kings Cross precinct. The Bill also adds additional train lines on which police officers may use dogs for that purpose so that all suburban train lines on which CityRail operates train services are covered. The 2012 Bill would insert new subsection 148 (1) (d) into the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 [LEPRA], to extend <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> sniffer dogs for general drug detection in authorised places (without warrant) to include "persons at any public place in the Kings Cross precinct". It would also amend the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Regulation 2005 to extend <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> detection dogs to all CityRail suburban train lines. On one view, the 2012 Bill does not involve the introduction of any new principle or practice into the criminal law. Rather, it can be said to extend the geographical fields of operation for defined police powers under s 148 of LEPRA. On the other hand, the 2012 Bill applies to an entire neighbourhood, which is partly residential in nature. In this respect its scope of operation can be said to be quite different to the current law, which is targeted to particular premises and events, as well to specified train lines. The purpose of this e-brief is to set out {{the background to}} this proposed legislation, looking at the development of the relevant statutory law, along with the debate about <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> sniffer dogs...|$|R
