Their lack of experience, coupled with a dispute over water rights, caused the company to close in 1869. After a brief respite in which <b>they</b> <b>filled</b> an order for iron wheels for the Central Pacific Railroad from 1874 to 1876, the company closed for good in 1878 and the assets were sold off at a sheriff's auction.|$|E

To ensure wide readership and to maximise their returns, Stern issued a prospectus to potentially interested parties, Newsweek, Time, Paris Match and a syndicate of papers owned by Murdoch. Stern rented a large vault in a Swiss bank. <b>They</b> <b>filled</b> the space with Nazi memorabilia and displayed various letters and manuscripts.|$|E

The other two ships, Hamburg and Berlin, were used as training cruisers through the 1920s. They were converted into barracks ships in the mid-1930s, a role <b>they</b> <b>filled</b> for a decade; in 1944, Hamburg was sunk by British bombers and later broken up for scrap, while Berlin was scuttled in deep water after the end of World War II to dispose of a load of chemical weapons.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 NHL Entry Draft {{was held}} in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 24 and 25. In the draft, Columbus {{selected}} two players who were projected to go higher in the draft.

Seth Ambroz, a projected third line enforcer, had some believing he would be taken in the second round prior to falling to the fifth. <b>They</b> <b>filled</b> out the other the remainder of their draft with players considered to have a high upside, but in need of time to develop their game.

Elland Road {{was used for the}} speech elements of the prince stammering his way through his first public address, and Odsal Stadium was selected because of the resemblance of its curved ends to Wembley Stadium in 1925. The crew had access to the stadium only at 10pm, after a football game. <b>They</b> <b>filled</b> the terraces with inflatable dummies and over 250 extras dressed in period costumes.

25|$|When Andrea Doria and Stockholm {{collided}} {{at almost}} a 90° angle, Stockholms sharply raked ice breaking prow pierced Andrea Dorias starboard side {{about one-third of}} her length from the bow.

Below the waterline, five fuel tanks on Andrea Doria's starboard side were torn open, and <b>they</b> <b>filled</b> with thousands of tons of seawater. Meanwhile, air was trapped in the five empty tanks on the port side, causing them to float more readily, contributing to a severe list. The ship's large fuel tanks were mostly empty {{at the time of the}} collision, since the ship was nearing the end of her voyage, but all the empty fuel tanks did was further increase the list.|$|E
25|$|By 1881 the Volta Associates {{had succeeded}} in {{improving}} an Edison tinfoil phonograph significantly. <b>They</b> <b>filled</b> the groove of its heavy iron cylinder with wax, then instead of wrapping a sheet of foil around it and using a blunt stylus to indent the recording into the foil, as Edison did, they used a chisel-like stylus to engrave the recording into the wax. The result was a clearer recording. Rather than apply for a patent at that time, however, they sealed the machine into a metal box and deposited it at the Smithsonian, specifying {{that it was not}} to be opened without the consent of two of the three men. By 1937 Tainter was the only one of the Associates still living, and the box preserved at the Smithsonian was opened with his permission. For the occasion, descendants of Alexander Graham Bell gathered in Washington, but Tainter, who held a lifelong admiration of Bell, was too ill to attend and remained at home in San Diego.|$|E

The Dodgers finished their rebuilding of the rotation on December 8 by signing Aaron Harang to a 2-year contract, with a vesting option.

500|$|Several of Cope's and Marsh's discoveries {{are among}} the most {{well-known}} of dinosaurs, encompassing species of Triceratops, Allosaurus, Diplodocus, Stegosaurus, Camarasaurus and Coelophysis. Their cumulative discoveries defined the then-nascent field of paleontology; before Cope's and Marsh's discoveries, there were only nine named species of dinosaur in North America. Some of their ideas—such as Marsh's argument that birds are descended from dinosaurs—have been upheld; while others are viewed as having little to no scientific merit. The Bone Wars also led to the discovery of the first complete skeletons, and the rise in popularity of dinosaurs with the public.
