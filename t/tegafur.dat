50|$|The major {{side effects}} of <b>tegafur</b> are similar to {{fluorouracil}} and include myelosuppression, central neurotoxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity (especially diarrhoea).

50|$|Excess uracil {{competes with}} 5-FU for DPD, thus {{inhibiting}} 5-FU catabolism.The <b>tegafur</b> {{is taken up}} by the cancer cells and breaks down into 5-FU, a substance that kills tumor cells.

Uracil has also been stated to help protect the gastrointestinal tract from 5-FU toxicity and the related metabolites, with less side effects than 5-FU and other 5-FU related (pro)drugs.

40|$|To the Editor: Groeningen et al 1 have {{provided}} clinical and phar-macokinetic information about orally administered S- 1. S- 1 {{is a combination}} of ftorafur or <b>tegafur,</b> 5 -chloro- 2, 4 -dihydroxypyridine (CDHP), and potassium oxonate; the ratio of the components is 1 : 0. 4 : 1. <b>Tegafur</b> is a tetrahydrofuryl-substituted fluorouracil (5 -FU) compound; <b>tegafur</b> is activated to 5 -FU. CDHP is a dihydropyrimidine dehydro-genase (DPD) inhibitor that inhibits DPD 180 -fold greater than uracil. Potassium oxonate is a potent inhibitor of phosphoribosylpyrophos-phate transferase, which is an enzyme that activates 5 -FU to fluorode-oxyuridine monophosphate. Most medical oncologists are familiar with the half-life of 5 -FU after short intravenous (IV) injection (10 to 15 minutes). The authors make the point that prolongation of 5 -FU half-life after S- 1 oral administration is evidence of reversible inhibi-tion of DPD in vivo by CDHP. The reported prolonged half-life of 5 -FU after oral administration of S- 1 is 3 to 4 hours. The 5 -FU half-life after short IV injection of 5 -FU is not the correct comparator. Because the source of 5 -FU in S- 1 is the 5 -FU prodrug <b>tegafur,</b> the comparator should be the 5 -FU half-life after administration of oral <b>tegafur.</b> Other authors have also used the 5 -FU half-life derived from IV 5 -FU as the comparator in articles about S- 12 and UFT (a combination of <b>tegafur</b> plus uracil as a DPD inhibitor). 3 Although the half-life of 5 -FU may be prolonged after S- 1 admin-istration, the magnitude of the prolongation may not be as large when the comparator is the 5 -FU half-life after <b>tegafur</b> and not after short IV injection of 5 -FU.

We aimed to assess the efficacy {{of a combination of}} uracil and <b>tegafur</b> for pathological stage III rectal cancer treated by standardized mesorectal excision with selective lateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. Methods: We randomly assigned patients with completely resected stage III rectal cancer, who underwent standardized mesorectal excision with selective lateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, to receive either oral uracil–tegafur (400 mg/m 2 <b>tegafur</b> per day) for one year or no treatment. Standardization and quality control of the surgery and pathological techniques were ensured by use of the guidelines of the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival. The secondary endpoint was overall survival. Results: We enrolled and randomized 276 patients. Excluding two ineligible patients, 274 were included in the analysis. Planned interim analysis 2 years after accrual termination revealed significant prolongation of relapse-free survival (P = 0. 001) and overall survival (P = 0. 005) in the uracil–tegafur group. The 3 -year relapse-free survival and overall survival rates were 7...|$|E
40|$|Bone {{metastasis}} from cutaneous {{squamous cell}} carcinoma (SCC) is rare. We report a case of cutaneous SCC which was diagnosed {{by the presence of}} bone metastasis and treated with combination chemotherapy. A 53 year male had tissue contusion and persistent ulcer in the multiple regions of body for about 30 years and treat with Chinese Herbal Drugs in several hospitals, however, did not thorough cure. He was referred to our hospital for a dermatological examination in March 2009. Excisional biopsy and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan showed an invasive cutaneous SCC concomitant bone metastasis. Surgical treatment is limited, because of multiple cancerous ulcer and metastatic spreading. Therefore, we proceed to treat with oxaliplatin, <b>tegafur</b> and leucovorin (LV) combination chemotherapy and other adjuvant therapy. About 5 months following chemotherapy, the general situation of the patient was improved. Further cycle of chemotherapy resulted in complete disappearance of the tumor masses (confirmed by PET-CT). So far, {{there was no evidence of}} local recurrence or distant metastasis. This report indicates that the combination chemotherapy of oxaliplatin, <b>tegafur</b> and LV seems to have a considerable therapeutic effect for cutaneous SCC concomitant malignant bone metastasis...|$|E
