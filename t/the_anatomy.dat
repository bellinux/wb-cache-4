5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Anatomy</b> Museum was {{a museum}} {{situated}} on the 6th floor of the King's Building at the Strand Campus. <b>The</b> <b>Anatomy</b> Theatre was built {{next door to the}} museum in 1927, where anatomical dissections and demonstrations took place. <b>The</b> <b>Anatomy</b> Museum's collection includes casts of injuries, leather models, skins of various animals from Western Australia donated to the museum in 1846, and casts of heads of John Bishop and Thomas Williams, the murderers in the Italian Boy's murder in 1831. The last dissection in <b>the</b> <b>Anatomy</b> Theatre was performed in 1997. <b>The</b> <b>Anatomy</b> Theatre and Museum was renovated and refurbished in 2009, and is now a facility for teaching, research and performance at King's.|$|E

5|$|The {{rest of the}} {{skeleton}} of Alioramus remotus is completely unknown except for three metatarsals (bones of the upper foot), but the discovery of A. altai, which is known from substantially more complete remains, has shed light on <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> of the genus.|$|E
5|$|According to Anthony S. Cheke and Julian Hume, <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> of the Mascarene grey parakeet {{suggests}} that its habits were largely terrestrial.

Both populations were said to be easy to hunt by capturing one individual and making it call out, which would summon an entire flock.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{determining}} factors {{for the success}} of endodontic therapy is understanding <b>the</b> morphological <b>anatomy</b> of <b>the</b> tooth structure and its variants in relation to its template <b>anatomy.</b> <b>The</b> internal <b>anatomy</b> of maxillary first premolars is particularly complex due to their variation in number of roots and canal configuration.

5|$|Carl Arend Friedrich Wiegmann (1893, 1898) {{discussed}} {{portions of}} <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> of A. adamsii, A. porcellanus, A. contrarius, and A. sinistralis. Walter Edward Collinge (1901, 1902) briefly noted features of A. palaceus and A. parakensis (reported as A. perversus). Haniel (1921) dissected A. contrarius and A. reflexilabris, and Bernhard Rensch published a few scattered {{notes in his}} various faunistic surveys. A few earlier notes are mentioned in Pilsbry (1900).|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{with all}} insects, <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> of the termite thorax {{consists}} of three segments: the prothorax, the mesothorax and the metathorax. Each segment contains a pair of legs. On alates, the wings are located at the mesothorax and metathorax. The mesothorax and metathorax have well-developed exoskeletal plates; the prothorax has smaller plates.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} part of the eighteenth century, the number of fossils in British {{collections}} quickly increased.

5000|$|The Apollo's Belt, {{also known}} as Iliac Furrow, is a term for a part of <b>the</b> human <b>anatomy.</b> It refers to two shallow grooves of <b>the</b> surface <b>anatomy</b> of <b>the</b> human abdomen running from the iliac crest (hip bone) to the pubis.|$|R
5|$|Past {{species have}} also left records of their {{evolutionary}} history. Fossils, along with <b>the</b> comparative <b>anatomy</b> of present-day organisms, constitute the morphological, or anatomical, record. By comparing <b>the</b> <b>anatomies</b> of both modern and extinct species, paleontologists can infer the lineages of those species. However, {{this approach is}} most successful for organisms that had hard body parts, such as shells, bones or teeth. Further, as prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies, their fossils do not provide information on their ancestry.|$|R
5|$|Leonardo also closely {{observed}} and recorded {{the effects of}} age and of human emotion on the physiology, studying in particular the effects of rage. He drew many figures who had significant facial deformities or signs of illness. Leonardo also studied and drew <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> of many animals, dissecting cows, birds, monkeys, bears, and frogs, and comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. He also {{made a number of}} studies of horses.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{started his}} study in <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> {{of the human}} body under the {{apprenticeship}} of Andrea del Verrocchio, who demanded that his students develop a deep knowledge of the subject.

5|$|Pteranodon {{species are}} {{extremely}} well {{represented in the}} fossil record, allowing for detailed descriptions of their anatomy and analysis of their life history. Over 1,000 specimens have been identified, though less than half are complete enough to give researchers good information on <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> of the animal. Still, this is more fossil material than is known for any other pterosaur, and it includes {{both male and female}} specimens of various age groups and, possibly, species.|$|E
50|$|A system anatomy {{is simple}} visual {{description}} of a system, focusing on the dependencies between system capabilities. <b>The</b> system <b>anatomy</b> was first used in a project at Ericsson, and Jack Järkvik, is considered {{the inventor of the}} concept.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Anatomy</b> Act 1832 {{ended the}} {{dissection}} of murderers, {{and most of}} the animal tortures depicted were outlawed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, so by the 1850s The Four Stages of Cruelty had come to be viewed as a somewhat historical series, though still one with the power to shock, a power it retains for a modern audience.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>anatomy</b> of 'Pachycephalosaurus' {{is poorly}} known, as only skull remains have been described. Pachycephalosaurus {{is famous for}} having a large, bony dome atop its skull, up to 25cm (10in) thick, which safely {{cushioned}} its tiny brain. The dome's rear aspect was edged with bony knobs and short bony spikes projected upwards from the snout. The spikes were probably blunt, not sharp.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>anatomy</b> of {{the muscles}} and {{skeleton}} is described in the Hippocratic Corpus, an Ancient Greek medical work written by unknown authors. Aristotle described vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection. Praxagoras identified the difference between arteries and veins. Also in the 4th century BCE, Herophilos and Erasistratus produced more accurate anatomical descriptions based on vivisection of criminals in Alexandria during the Ptolemaic dynasty.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{performed}} a micro-CT analysis of extant hominoid subnasal anatomy and {{a review of}} <b>the</b> subnasal <b>anatomy</b> of <b>the</b> Miocene hominoids. This thesis tested {{the hypothesis that the}} extant hominoids exhibit diagnostic morphological patterns of <b>the</b> subnasal <b>anatomy</b> that are phylogenetically informative. The terminology of <b>the</b> subnasal <b>anatomy</b> was revised and new measurements were constructed to analyze the morphology of <b>the</b> hominoid subnasal <b>anatomy.</b> It is suggested that previous analyses of <b>the</b> hominoid subnasal <b>anatomy</b> were limited by technological constraints, poorly constructed measurements, and ambiguous terminology. This micro-CT analysis confirmed that the extant hominoids do exhibit diagnostic patterns of their subnasal morphology and that these patterns are indeed phylogenetically informative. A new character state was also discovered that differentiated extant cercopithecoids from extant hominoids. The extant hominids exhibit a shared derived subnasal morphology, while Pongo exhibits the most diagnostic and derived morphological pattern among the extant hominoids...|$|R

5|$|The {{study of}} <b>the</b> <b>anatomy</b> {{of the brain}} is neuroanatomy, while the study of its {{function}} is neuroscience. A number of techniques are used to study the brain.
