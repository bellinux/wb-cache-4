5|$|As a two-lane roadway, M-199 {{starts at}} exit119 along I-94 {{northwest}} of Albion in Sheridan Township. The highway runs southward through farm fields along 26Mile Road before curving {{to the southwest}} on Star Commonwealth Road near {{the campus of the}} Montcalm School for Boys and Girls, a private boarding school. At the end of this curves, the highway follows 25½Mile Road southward to the intersection with Michigan Avenue. There M-199 turns easterly along Michigan Avenue and passes south of Montcalm Lake. The trunkline runs parallel to a line of the Norfolk Southern Railway until about the intersection with 26½Mile Road. At the intersection with 27Mile Road, M-199 enters the city of Albion, and the street name changes to Austin Avenue. In town, the highway follows a four-lane street through residential neighborhoods. The trunkline passes the northern edge of McAuliffe Park and runs parallel to the Kalamazoo River. At the intersection with Eaton Street, the highway meets BL I-94, where M-199 ends while the business loop continues southeasterly on Austin Avenue at <b>this</b> <b>corner.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the University of Leicester Archaeological Services {{decided to}} {{excavate}} the presumed {{location of the}} abbey's kitchens, to clarify the layout of that area of the abbey. These first excavations located both {{the north and south}} walls and a 15th–16th-century brick oven, confirming that it was indeed the kitchens. The area excavated was enlarged in 2003, with the south-west corner of the building and a second oven uncovered: <b>this</b> <b>corner</b> had not been entirely robbed of stone, with two courses of sandstone remaining. The second oven was found to contain charcoal, fragments of wheat and barley, fish-bones and hazelnuts. A drain identified in the 1930s excavation was also located, and found to contain small bones, fish-scales, and the bones of rats who had formerly lived in the drain.|$|E

25|$|The {{architecture}} of <b>this</b> <b>corner</b> house {{is typical of}} {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century: a two-storey (plus attic) tenement, with few decoration on the outside, except a frieze running beneath the gable, some shed dormers, and a nicely adorned bay window on the corner. Quite noticeable is the entry in the corner, flanked by two columns.|$|E
25|$|A shorter circuit was created, {{creating}} another, less tight hairpin {{halfway up}} the straight, bypassing most of the old straight. <b>This</b> <b>corner</b> was still not ideal, as drivers ran wide despite the corner being wider and had to avoid the pitlane entry barrier.

This was {{the corner on}} which he built his house, the first at Dyker Heights. The Dyker Heights Civic Association, the Dyker Heights Historical Society, and Council Member Vincent J. Gentile, of the 43rd district, were instrumental in the naming of <b>this</b> <b>corner.</b> On December 28, 2009 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg signed the bill into law.|$|E
25|$|The Delaware River has {{followed}} a southeast course until now, but after Morrisville in Falls Township it turns approximately ninety degrees to flow southwest. The canal and park turn southwest earlier {{and leave the}} river in Morrisville, cutting off <b>this</b> <b>corner.</b> The park and canal pass through Falls Township to the borough of Tullytown, where they again follows a course parallel to the river. From Tullytown the canal passes through Bristol Township and ends at the borough of Bristol.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, {{there had been}} a small inner court in <b>this</b> <b>corner</b> of the Enderûn Courtyard. This court led through the Kuşhane Gate into the harem. Today this is the gate from which the {{visitors}} exit from the Harem. Birds were raised for the sultan's table in the buildings around the gate. On the inscription over the Kuşhane door one reads that Mahmud I had the kitchen of the Kuşhane repaired. The balcony of the aviary facing the Harem Gate was constructed during repair work in 1916. The building's facade resembles traditional aviaries.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>corner</b> is {{also the}} former site of the country's longest-serving gasworks, which {{operated}} from 1863 to 1987, and a small industrial museum, the Dunedin Gasworks Museum, {{is located on the}} southern part of its site on Braemar Street. Opened to the public in 2001, this museum is one of only three known preserved gasworks museums in the world. The museum features five steam pumping engines which were used in the gasworks, and an older engine imported from Scotland in 1868. Three of the buildings within the Gasworks complex have NZHPT classifications: the skeleton of the 1879 gasometer, the exhauster and boiler house, and the fitting shop (all Category I).|$|E
25|$|The North West Corner, or North West terrace {{as it is}} {{sometimes}} still referred to as, despite now being all seated is the only major section of the stadium to remain uncovered (the other area is the Kop Corner). The original North West Terrace was built between 1919 and 1920 to adjoin both the North Stand and West Stand, but was demolished in early 1965 and replaced in mid 1966, {{in time for the}} 1966 World Cup. The terrace was not in use for two years, and seats were installed in 1991 along with the Leppings Lane terrace. The stand failed to gain a safety certificate for the 2007–08 season. In recent years it had only been used as overspill for away fans when both the upper and lower tiers of the West Stand have been filled, however in the 2011–12 season, with Wednesday needing to better or match the result of their neighbours to gain promotion {{on the final day of}} the season, the Corner was opened to visiting Wycombe Wanderers fans, with the West Stand used by home supporters. Whilst not being used for seating, the Corner has recently been used as extra advertising space, with advertising boards on the back wall, and more recently a large 'My Sheffield Jobs' seat covering appearing alongside their sponsorship of the North Stand. It is sponsored by Handley Brown. <b>This</b> <b>corner</b> is to be roofed, under the Hillsborough stadium Upgrade plans, yet no work has yet been done, due to owners of the nearby terraces complaining. <b>This</b> <b>corner</b> is commonly nicknamed the 'Crows Nest' by Wednesdayites.The corner is still unable to gain a safety certificate and remains unused by fans. Television company Sky use the corner for their temporary studios and technical area for televised games.|$|E

25|$|Tetepetl Hill is a sharp {{rise from}} the Valley of the Matlatzinco running along {{the west side of}} the modern town of Tenango de Arista in the State of Mexico. It forms an {{elongated}} mesa, with steep slopes on the north and east sides, varying in height from 70 to 250 meters that serve as natural defenses. While the surface of this mesa is 16.5km2, only about 2km2 in the extreme northeast of the mesa was inhabited. With the exception of <b>this</b> <b>corner</b> of the mesa, the entire hill is covered by a layer of dark gray solidified lava, the result of a volcanic eruption that occurred approximately 10,000 years ago. This makes most of the mesa difficult to cross and impossible to farm. To make the city possible, the northeast corner needed to be significantly modified by terracing and filling in low areas. The mesa contains no rivers, but there are a number of fresh-water springs which served as the ancient city’s water supply.|$|E
25|$|I needed good victims. Recent news {{had offered}} an {{excellent}} group, the Baha'is, {{who had been}} horribly persecuted in Iran. The more I researched them, the more convinced I became that they would make excellent space colonists. My primary reference was an aged primer on the Baha'i Faith by J. E. Esselmont. I did receive some comments from several Baha'is suggesting that I'd portrayed them as too pacifistic, however, I'll stick by my guns on this. My characters, while they believe in public defense, even armies, to preserve peace, are stubborn in living by a passage I found in Esselmont's book in which Baha'u'llah forbids the Baha'is from taking up arms {{in the defense of}} the faith. The story is carefully crafted to back them into <b>this</b> <b>corner.</b> Our hero is faced with a loss of his faith, which enables him to take action to save his people, but leaves him in a spiritual dilemma.|$|E
25|$|The Kop Corner {{is a small}} filling section {{which is}} adjoined to the Main Spion Kop. It is the second largest area of the ground to remain uncovered, after the North West Corner. <b>This</b> <b>corner</b> is usually just {{referred}} to {{as part of the}} Spion Kop, as is its capacity, and it is rare to see it referred to as a separate area. The Kop Corner was a lot larger before the installation of the Spion Kop roof in 1986, but a crane was needed to lift the roof, and the Kop Corner was destroyed so the crane could get in. Part of the corner was rebuilt, which is the present day area. Seats were installed in 1993 to correspond with the Taylor report, as was the rest of the Kop. This area was to be extended, and fully filled in under Sheffield Wednesday's ground renovation plans. The corner is well known amongst Wednesdayites as the location of Paul Gregory, aka 'Tango Man' on match days, along with his 'Wolverhampton Owls' flag and {{is often referred to as}} 'Tango's corner' by the Wednesdayites.|$|E
5000|$|In vehicle dynamics, {{slip angle}} or {{sideslip}} angle is the angle between a rolling wheel's actual {{direction of travel}} and the direction towards which it is pointing (i.e., {{the angle of the}} vector sum of wheel forward velocity [...] and lateral velocity [...] ). For a free-rolling wheel this slip angle results in a force parallel to the axle and the component of the force perpendicular to the wheel's direction of travel is the <b>cornering</b> force. <b>This</b> <b>cornering</b> force increases approximately linearly for the first few degrees of slip angle, then increases non-linearly to a maximum before beginning to decrease.|$|R
