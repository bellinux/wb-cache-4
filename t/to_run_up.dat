5|$|A defenseman is {{a player}} {{position}} whose {{responsibility is to}} assist the goalkeeper in preventing the opposing team from scoring. Each team fields three defensemen. These players generally remain on the defensive half of the field. Unless a defenseman gets the ball and chooses <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>up</b> the field and try to score or pass, by doing this {{they will need to}} cross the midfield line and signal one midfielder to stay back. A defensemen carries a long crosse which provides an advantage in reach for intercepting passes and checking.|$|E

When the van breaks down early on, the family learns that they must push the van until it is moving at about 20mph before it is put into gear, at which point they have <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>up</b> to the side door and jump in. Later on, the van's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Corporation {{stated that}} it wished <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>up</b> to four multichannels at {{different}} times of the day or alternatively offer an HDTV service. It claimed that up to $100 million would be needed to prepare for these services, half of which would need to be government-funded. Other interested parties, such as internet service provider OzEmail argued for the provision of spectrum for interactive services, while Telstra, shareholder in the subscription television provider Foxtel, supported ASTRA's argument for a competitive bidding process for digital spectrum.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech downed Texas' {{subsequent}} kickoff in its {{end zone}} for a touchback, and the Hokies attempted {{to answer the}} Texas score starting at the Tech 20-yard line. During the first play after the kickoff, Texas and Tech both committed penalties. After the penalties, Tech had a first down at its 27-yard line. After the penalties, running back Ken Oxendine attempted <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>up</b> {{the middle of the}} field, but had the ball knocked loose by defender Tony Brackens. Texas recovered the fumble and the Longhorns' offense returned to the field at the Tech 32-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Competing {{with the}} {{arboreal}} hypothesis {{is the idea}} that birds evolved from running bird ancestors, known as the cursorial (or ground up) hypothesis. This scenario may have involved ancient birds jumping or running along the ground and briefly becoming airborne, perhaps to avoid obstacles or catch insects. As these animals strove to overcome the force of gravity, powered flight may have appeared early on. They may also have used their ground speed <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>up</b> trees or other steep slopes, developing increasingly sophisticated flapping mechanism to assist with this. This model requires a highly cursorial and feathered ancestor. Proponents of the cursorial hypothesis cite the legs, feet and hands of Archaeopteryx as inheritance from a cursorial maniraptoran ancestor. This model has also had many adherents over the years, including John Ostrom and Jacques Gauthier.|$|E
5|$|From 1961 to 1967, he was {{a leading}} member of a strong Scottish {{international}} team that lost only once to England, in 1965, shortly after he recovered from the leg fracture. He thought his best international performance was a 2–1 win against England in 1963, when he scored both goals after Scotland were reduced to 10 players. In the 1967 match against England, who had won the 1966 World Cup, he taunted the opposition by ball juggling while waiting for his teammates to find good positions. Although he was given most {{of the credit for}} the 3–2 win, some commentators wished he had made an effort <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>up</b> a bigger score.|$|E

5|$|In 1803, {{war with}} France {{appeared}} imminent once again. After some discussions, {{it was agreed}} to adapt the 16th-century keep to enable it to hold six 24-pounder (10.8kg) guns; the roof was vaulted and a central stone pillar was installed <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>up</b> through the building, work estimated {{at the time to}} be likely to cost £4,122. The historian Andrew Saunders likens the resulting building to the various Martello towers being constructed along the south coast at this time. It was proposed to build two temporary gun batteries to replace the 1795 emplacements, which had suffered from the salt air and decayed, but the plan was turned down in order to focus attention on the redevelopment of the keep. The work was carried out by a mixture of soldiers and civilian contractors and was completed by the end of 1806.|$|E
5|$|At that intersection, the {{trunkline}} {{meets the}} northern end of M-22, which is running concurrently with M-72 along the parkway. As US31/M-37 turns east to run along the bay north of downtown, the highway merges with M-72 and picks up the LMCT again. Grandview Parkway runs between the Boardman River and the bay. Near the mouth of the river, US31/M-37/M-72 turns to follow Front Street along the remainder of the bay's shoreline. At Garfield Avenue, M-37 turns northward <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>up</b> the Old Mission Peninsula, and US31/M-72 continues across the base of the peninsula to the East Arm of the Grand Traverse Bay. The highway runs north of the Cherry Capital Airport near the east arm as it angles southeasterly to Traverse City State Park. East of the park, the trunkline exits suburban Traverse City and rounds the bay to run northward along its eastern shore. In the community of Acme, M-72 turns eastward while US31 continues north past the Grand Traverse Resort.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1970s, video games existed almost entirely as novelties passed around by programmers and technicians with access to computers, primarily at research institutions and large companies. The history of video games transitioned into a new era early in the decade, however, with the rise of the commercial video game industry. In 1971, Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck developed a coin-operated computer game, Galaxy Game, at Stanford University using a DEC PDP-11 computer with vector displays. The pair was inspired to make the game by Spacewar; Tuck had remarked in 1966 while playing the game that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was unfeasible in 1966 due to the cost of computers, but in 1969 DEC released the PDP-11 for US$20,000; while this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, the pair felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing. Only prototype units were ever built, though the second prototype was adapted <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>up</b> to eight games at once; a few months before the initial installation at Stanford in November 1971, the pair met with Nolan Bushnell, who informed them of his own game he was making for a much lower price.|$|E

5|$|Continuing Navy's {{drive from}} the {{previous}} quarter, Polanco and Eckel continued <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>up</b> the middle and {{the right side of}} New Mexico's defense for small gains. Polanco attempted two passes, the first of which was incomplete and the second to slotback Marco Nelson for a first down at the Midshipmen 44-yard line. After 12 plays and over six minutes of game time, the drive reached midfield. After six more rushing plays from Polanco, Eckel, and slotback Eric Roberts, the team reached the Lobos' 28-yard line. Needing three yards to achieve a fourth down conversion, Navy coach Paul Johnson called a time-out. On the next play, Frank Divis threw his second halfback option pass of the day to Polanco, gaining six yards to keep the drive alive. Eckel, Divis, and Roberts rushed for six more plays before the drive came to a halt at the Lobos' 5-yard line. On the final play of the drive, Midshipman kicker Geoff Blumenfeld kicked a 22-yard field goal to make the score 34–19 with 2:07 left in the game.|$|E
5|$|M-72 starts its trans-peninsular journey at M-22 in the {{community}} of Empire on the shores of Lake Michigan in the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. From there it runs easterly uphill through mixed farmland and forest to cross the base of the Leelanau Peninsula. As the highway approaches the city of Traverse City, the roadway runs downhill and weaves {{back and forth across the}} Leelanau– Grand Traverse county line. M-72 merges with M-22 to run concurrently in the section of Traverse City in Leelanau County and immediately cross the county line into Grand Traverse County. The two highways run along Grandview Parkway, a four-lane boulevard on the shore of the West Arm of Grand Traverse Bay. At the intersection of Grandview Parkway and Division Street, M-22 ends. US31/M-37 run north along Division Street and turn east onto Grandview Parkway to join M-72. These three highways stay merged in a triple concurrency along the length of Grandview Parkway and across the Boardman River along the bay, bypassing downtown. They then follow Front Street until reaching Garfield Avenue east of downtown. At Garfield, M-37 turns north <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>up</b> the Old Mission Peninsula which separates the west and east arms of Grand Traverse Bay. US31/M-72 continues east along the shores of the East Arm of Grand Traverse Bay and northward to a junction in Acme. M-72 turns east to cross rural eastern Grand Traverse County along rolling hills through the communities of Williamsburg and Barker Creek.|$|E
5|$|The concept art {{as well as}} the game's codename, Horizon, were leaked in September 2014. Horizon Zero Dawn {{was officially}} {{announced}} during Sony Interactive Entertainment's E3 2015 press conference. The game was featured as the cover story in the September 2015 issue of Edge and the October 2016 issue of Game Informer. At E3 2016, Sony had a life-sized cosplay version of one of the machines greet the trade show attendees. Originally set to be released in 2016, the game was later delayed to February 2017 so as to give additional time for the development team to polish the game. It was released to manufacturing in late January 2017. The game launched to North American markets on 28 February 2017, in Europe on 1 March and Asia on 2 March for the PlayStation 4. Horizon Zero Dawn is forward compatible with the PS4 Pro, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>up</b> to 4K resolution. In April 2017, a 47-minute documentary about the making of Horizon Zero Dawn was released by Dutch public television. By March 2017, a story expansion had already been set in motion. New Game Plus, an Ultra Hard difficulty mode, additional trophies and aesthetic features were introduced with a patch released in July 2017. The expansion, The Frozen Wilds, launched on 7 November 2017. Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition, which contains the base game, The Frozen Wilds, and all additional downloadable content, releases on 5 December 2017.|$|E

5|$|The Kansas City Chiefs {{credited}} {{their defense}} with the win after holding the Buccaneers to 14 yards rushing. The Buccaneers managed only 2 first downs and 34 yards of total offense before exploding for three {{touchdowns in the}} final ten minutes. The Buccaneers were mistake-prone and ineffective throughout the first three quarters. Ken Stone was penalized for roughing on a missed field goal in the first quarter, {{with the result that}} the Chiefs got a second chance to kick it. The special teams allowed Henry Marshall to return a punt 59 yards, setting up the Chiefs’ second touchdown. They got 14 first downs and 162 yards in the final 15 minutes, scoring on an Essex Johnson run and passes from Steve Spurrier to Johnny McKay and Jack Novak. Coach McKay felt that the difference was that the team did not begin giving effort until the fourth quarter. McKay also felt that the Chiefs left themselves vulnerable by trying <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>up</b> the score. Bert Cooper, filling in at linebacker for an injured Steve Reese, was consistently exploited in the passing game. McKay later threatened to fire players who he felt were giving a slack effort, specifically referring to a Chiefs kickoff that rolled {{all the way to the}} 4-yard line, with no Buccaneers trying to recover it. Spectators booed the team, and one threw a dead bird at Spurrier as he returned to the locker room after the game. Buccaneer defenders found some consolation in having held the AFC’s top offensive team to only 13 points. Defensive end Council Rudolph played, despite the death of his father the previous evening.|$|E
