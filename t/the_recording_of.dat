40|$|Koristeći bogatu arhivsku građu matičnih knjiga grada Pule, autor je u ovome članku analizirao relativno malobrojne slučajeve koji se odnose na spominjanje pripadnika nekih posebnih skupina, poput Cigana, ali i pojedinaca s različitim tjelesnim i psihičkim nedostatcima, kao što su slijepe, kljaste, šepave, nijeme i mentalno zaostale osobe. Using the {{plentiful}} archival fond of {{the civil}} and ecclesiastical <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city of Pula, in this article author analyses <b>recorded</b> cases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relatively not numerous groups of people, such as Gipsies, mentally retarded, blind, physically disabled and mute persons. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> Pula Gipsies are mentioned under the term Cigalo, Cingano, Cingaro and Zingaro. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriages {{one of them is}} mentioned two times {{at the beginning of the}} eighteenth century. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baptisms Gipsies are mentioned 10 times: two times in the seventeenth century and eight times in the eighteenth century. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased they are mentioned 13 times: fi ve times in the seventeenth century and eight times in the eighteenth century. Mentally disabled persons are rarely <b>recorded</b> in <b>the</b> sources, too – only 11 times. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriages they are not mentioned at all, but in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decea-sed the most of them are mentioned. Blind persons are mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased only two times (both in the eighteenth century), and in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy confi rmation only one blind person is documented (in the nineteenth century). Similarly, in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy confi rmation only one blind person is <b>recorded.</b> By <b>the</b> same token, only one physically disabled person is <b>recorded</b> in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased (in the mid eighteenth century), and only one limping person is mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy confi rmation (in the nineteenth century). Likewise, one mentally retarded boy is <b>recorded</b> in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased in the mid eighteenth century. Mute persons are mentioned 4 times: once in the second half of the eighteenth century and three times in the beginning of the nineteenth century. To sum all, Gipsies and variously disabled persons are recorded 36 times: 21 recordings in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased, 11 notes in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> baptisms, and two times in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy confi rmation and in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriages.
