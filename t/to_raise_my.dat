500|$|After World War II, Jabara {{considered}} {{leaving the}} military to attend college, but later decided to attend the Tactical Air School at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. From 1947 to 1949 he was stationed on Okinawa with the 53d Fighter Group. At Okinawa in 1948, Jabara flew his first jet aircraft, the [...] Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star. Reflecting on the transition to jet aircraft, he said [...] "It was entirely different. I was at 10,000 feet before I remembered <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> landing gear. ...It was so quiet and fast. ...I guess {{that was probably the}} happiest moment of my life." [...] Jabara returned to the United States and was assigned as a flight commander, now at the rank of captain, with the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, flying the newly operational North American F-86 Sabre jet fighter at the New Castle County Airport in Delaware.|$|E
500|$|Just before Vladimir died, he {{had sent}} his son Boris on {{campaign}} against the nomads in the south. According to the Primary Chronicle, Sviatopolk seized Kiev while those of Vladimir's retainers who were with Boris on campaign encouraged Boris to take power, an offer Boris refused apparently stating [...] "Be it not for me <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> hand against my elder brother". In the confusion resulting from the death of Vladimir Sviatopolk was able to seize power in Kiev, as Yaroslav was in the north, Mstislav in the south, Sviatoslav in the Derevlian land, Gleb in Murom and Boris on the aforementioned expedition against the Pechenegs. As Franklin and Shepard put it, Sviatopolk's [...] "previous arrest turned to his advantage, for it ensured that he was already ... closest {{to the center of}} power". According to the Primary Chronicle, Sviatopolk successfully arranged the murder of three of his brothers, Boris of Rostov, Gleb of Murom and Sviatoslav of the Derevlian lands.|$|E

[...] Then went they to the ship, and saw upon the sands within the {{promontory}} three elevations, and went thither, and saw there three skin boats (canoes), and three men under each. Then divided they their people, and caught them all, except one, who {{got away with}} his boat. They killed the other eight, {{and then went back}} to the cape, and looked round them, and saw some heights inside of the firth, and supposed that these were dwellings. — Beamish (1864), p.71 ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think so, Mas'r," [...] said Tom; [...] "the poor crittur's {{sick and}} feeble; 't would be downright cruel, and it's what I never will do, nor begin to. Mas'r, {{if you mean}} to kill me, kill me; but, as <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>raising</b> <b>my</b> hand agin any one here, I never shall,--I'll die first!" ...|$|R

2500|$|When the Americans {{arrived in}} the village, [...] "I was {{identified}} as a soldier, had to put back on the uniform I had already abandoned, had <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> hands and join the steadily growing throng of war prisoners whom they were lining up on our meadow. It especially cut my good mother's heart to see her boy {{and the rest of the}} defeated army standing there, exposed to an uncertain fate..." [...] Ratzinger was briefly interned in a POW camp near Ulm and was released on 19 June 1945. He and another young man began to walk the [...] home but got a lift to Traunstein in a milk truck. The family was reunited when his brother, Georg, returned after being released from a POW camp in Italy.|$|E
2500|$|Mel Gibson {{was cast}} as English settler John Smith {{following}} {{a desire to}} make [...] "something for my kids." [...] In a notable contrast to previous voice actors for Disney animated features, Gibson provided the singing voice for his character, which the actor has described as {{the most difficult part}} of his role. Christian Bale auditioned for the role of Thomas. As he explained in an interview with Disney Adventures, [...] "the directors played with Thomas being Irish and Scottish and younger than I am, so I had <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> voice and do different accents. But the more we did it, the more he became like me--older and English." [...] Richard White, the voice of Gaston in Beauty and the Beast was supposed to voice Ratcliffe, but the crew was worried he might sound too much like Gaston, so he was replaced by his co-star David Ogden Stiers. Russell Means was cast as Chief Powhatan, though he expressed displeasure with the script in that Native Americans addressed each other using proper names rather than the traditional [...] "my father" [...] or [...] "my friend". Indigenous Canadian First Nation actor Gordon Tootoosis was also cast as the tribal shaman Nekata.|$|E

6000|$|... "Fresnel," [...] he said, quietly, [...] "if, as you say, {{the gallows}} claim me, {{the thing that}} has brought me to this {{extremity}} arises out of the shooting of Mabey.

6000|$|... "Did you get {{the stock}} clear?" [...] I gasped, striving <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> head from the hay truss {{in which it was}} almost buried; and {{somebody}} who stooped down held a bottle to my lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{say that}} I ever did," [...] Deerslayer answered, modestly. [...] "Youth {{is the time}} to l'arn; and I'm far from wishing <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> voice in counsel, afore it is {{justified}} by exper'ence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've figured on that," [...] Drummond replied, with a cunning look, though Stormont {{saw he was}} flattered. [...] "You {{want some}} money to begin, but I've a notion how I'm going <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> pile." ...|$|E

60|$|Presently {{without a}} word he took one of my hands in his and {{dropping}} <b>to</b> one knee <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> fingers <b>to</b> his lips.

60|$|As I {{was about}} <b>to</b> answer, and <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> {{eyes for the}} purpose, they {{encountered}} those of Miss Vernon, who, having entered the room unobserved during the conversation, had given it her close attention.

6000|$|... 'And none then,' {{said the}} officer, {{in a low}} voice. 'You forget, my poor child, that I mortgaged the whole estate <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> legion. We must not shrink from looking at things as they are.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’m not goin’ <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> {{hand against}} {{a woman for}} anybody," [...] said the mate with decision. [...] "It’s no part of my work to get messed up with tar and paint from lady passengers." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Where is Dunwoodie, Isabella?" [...] he said. [...] "The {{excellent}} fellow {{is never}} weary of kind actions.

60|$|I saw the maid's tender eyes <b>raised</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> {{face with}} a look of great {{compassion}} and sweetness whilst I spoke. I observed the pressure which she put on his arm.

6000|$|... "I'm not minded to take {{so much of}} {{punishment}} as that involves, if it can in any way be avoided, therefore it is I give you my solemn word not <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> voice above a whisper from now till sunset." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The bridge {{gave way}} when I was half across," [...] was the muttered response. [...] "I think my leg's broken. I fell in and couldn't get clear--just managed <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> {{head out of}} the water and cling to the rail." ...|$|E

5000|$|Being {{the owner}} of dachshunds, to me a book on dog {{discipline}} becomes a volume of inspired humor. Every sentence is a riot. Some day, if I ever get a chance, I shall write a book, or warning, on the character and temperament of the dachshund and why he can't be trained and shouldn't be. I would rather train a striped zebra to balance an Indian club than induce a dachshund to heed my slightest command. When I address Fred I never have <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> either <b>my</b> voice or my hopes. He even disobeys me when I instruct him in something he wants to do. E. B. White ...|$|R
