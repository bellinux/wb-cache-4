6000|$|... "The canary creeper's got {{in among}} the pine trees now," [...] said {{the man with the}} lorgnette. [...] "It wasn't <b>there</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> You can see it grow while you watch it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not now," [...] said Burton; [...] "we {{just came}} from there; {{but there has been}} someone <b>there</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> for there is still a fire in the kitchen range. Does anyone live there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry, sir," [...] said Edward, {{holding out}} May's left hand, and {{especially}} the third finger, [...] "that the young lady can't accompany you to church; but, as she has been <b>there</b> once <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> perhaps you'll excuse her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the worst}} saloon here," [...] the Sheriff replied. [...] "They've been there pretty well all night, drinking, and they're <b>there</b> again <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> hard at it. They've both got firearms, and though I ain't exactly a nervous man, Mr. Quest--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So it is," [...] {{said his}} father; [...] "but all {{motion of the}} air is not wind. Wind is a current of air, that is, a {{progressive}} motion;--and in fact, <b>there</b> is, <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> a slight current from the westward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, sir," [...] an old sailor said close by. [...] "They are all doomed. There {{were over}} thirty ships <b>there</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> for I counted them, and I doubt if one will live out the night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will go with}} you," [...] the Duchess decided. [...] "I {{should like}} to see Broomleys again. As a matter of fact, I meant to go <b>there</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> but I found one call enough for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My hair? It was all <b>there</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Sister, it {{was that}} woman, I {{remember}} now, I was not quite sound asleep, but I had no power to move or cry out, and the woman was snipping and Loveday crying." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'DEAR F.,--There {{were three}} of us last night; <b>there</b> are five <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Isabel and the twins are doing well. Heaven knows what is to become of us! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was sure}} of it," [...] said Fred. [...] "I knew I should never see her again; and <b>there</b> were sounds <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Did not I hear poor Henrietta crying?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait a bit," [...] said Uncle William. [...] "I think {{since you}} have gone to all the trouble of cooking the dinner it's only fair you should stay and help to eat it. Accidents seem to be rather fashionable just now. My housekeeper's son broke his leg down at Weston, and I had to take her <b>there</b> early <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Come, {{introduce}} yourselves. To whom am I indebted for this pleasant surprise?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Spencer," [...] he said, [...] "my visit to-night {{is mainly}} to you. I dare {{say you are}} aware that a {{somewhat}} unpleasant thing has happened at my house. My people {{tell me that you}} called <b>there</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and inquired for Mr. Fielding." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Plain {{words is}} more than you'll get from Job," [...] Lethbridge replied gloomily. [...] "He slept last night {{on the floor at}} the 'Blue Crown,' and he's <b>there</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> clamouring for brandy and pawing the air. He's got the blue devils, that's what he's got." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said. [...] "I went <b>there</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{directly}} I {{had your}} note. I feel rather self-reproachful about Clara Mannering. I meant to have looked after her more. She is rather an uninteresting young woman, though, and I am afraid I have let her drift away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll just repeat {{my story}} of that morning, French," [...] Quest said. [...] "We {{went out to}} find Macdougal, and succeeded, as you know. Just as I was {{starting}} for home, those two thugs set upon me. They nearly did me up. You know how I made my escape. They went off in my automobile and sold it in Bethel. I arrested them <b>there</b> myself <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Here's the Sheriff, who will bear out what I say, also that {{they arrived at the}} place in my automobile." ...|$|R
60|$|Our {{hotel in}} New York {{was on fire}} again the other night. But fires {{in this country are}} quite matters of course. There was a large one <b>there</b> at four <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and I don't think a single night has passed since I have been under the {{protection}} of the Eagle, but I have heard the fire bells dolefully clanging all over the city.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{heard it}} {{down at the}} harbor, Thyra. Mike McCready's vessel, the Nora Lee, was just in from the Magdalens. Ches and Joe got capsized {{the night of the}} storm, but they hung on to their boat somehow, and at daybreak they were picked up by the Nora Lee, bound for Quebec. But she was damaged by the storm and blown clear out of her course. Had to put into the Magdalens for repairs, and has been there ever since. The cable to the islands was out of order, and no vessels call <b>there</b> <b>this</b> time of year for mails. If it hadn't been an extra open season the Nora Lee wouldn't have got away, but would have had to stay there till spring. You never saw such rejoicing as <b>there</b> was <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> at the harbor, when the Nora Lee came in, flying flags at the mast head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{got to keep}} going. There's a scare on. Did {{you notice}} the rooms? Half the people out <b>there</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> are reporters. And if I talk they touch it up!... They didn't used to touch things up! Now they put in {{character}} touches--insulting you. Don't know what journalism's coming to. It's all Boom's doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, here's luck, Miss," [...] said Bill, exultingly; [...] "I {{saw this}} gentleman lying {{down on the}} beach <b>there</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> He's a cuttle, that's what he is; and I'll have his ink-bag out of him in a brace of shakes; just the ticket for tattooing, Miss, {{as good as the}} best Indian-ink--gunpowder is a fool to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was {{something}} there," [...] said Tabitha slowly. [...] "I’ll swear it, for I {{stood on the}} landing by her door and listened; something scuffling on the floor round and round the room. At first I {{thought it was the}} cat, but when I went up <b>there</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> the door was still locked, and the cat was in the kitchen." ...|$|E
40|$|Sikonge. Die Aussätzigen in ihrem Lager, 17 wohnen dort. Eine Frau war nur diesen Morgen gerade da zur Behandlung" ("Sikonge. The lepers {{at their}} camp, 17 live there. A woman was <b>there</b> only <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> for treatment"). A group of {{eighteen}} Africans photographed {{in front of}} a building.; Paul Albert Theile, born in 1908 in Niesky (Germany), was a theologian and preacher. He was no missionary in Africa, but went on an educational journey to East Africa in 1933 and to South Africa in 1934. He was a mission deputy in Montmirail (France) from 1934 till 1938. In 1948 he married Susette Schmidt. After 1962 he was director of the Moravian Church in Switzerland. He died in 1995 in Birsfelden (near Basel / Switzerland) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. He {{should have}} trusted me, as I had trusted him. He missed {{me at the}} Villette gate on Friday, and without a thought left me--left us all in the lurch; he threw himself into the lion's jaws, {{thinking}} that he could help the girl he loved. I knew that I could save her. She is in comparative safety even now. The old woman, Madame Belhomme, had been freely released the day after her arrest, but Jeanne Lange {{is still in the}} house in the Rue de Charonne. You know it, Ffoulkes. I got her <b>there</b> early <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> It was easy for me, of course: 'Hola, Dupont! my boots, Dupont!' 'One moment, citizen, my daughter--' 'Curse thy daughter, bring me my boots!' and Jeanne Lange walked out of the Temple prison her hand in that of that lout Dupont." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, Mike, this is {{my report}} that I wrote out {{yesterday}} evening;" [...] {{and he took a}} packet from the inside of his coat. [...] "When we start tomorrow morning I shall put it in my left holster. If I am shot, you will not wait for a moment, but will snatch it out and ride on to Madrid, and deliver it to the duke <b>there.</b> I have, <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> added a few lines relating the murder of Colonel Mendez, the hurried trial and execution of the storekeepers, and the attempts upon my life, and said I have not the least doubt that the governor is at the bottom of it all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I suppose I was {{thinking}} that the leaves were beginning to turn in the sugar orchard," [...] answered Lydia faithfully. [...] "I {{was thinking}} how still the sun {{would be in the}} pastures, <b>there,</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> I suppose the stillness here put me in mind of it. One of these bells has the same tone as our bell at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{actually}} so! The instruments and batteries and everything, all packed up in boxes--Tom couldn't {{say how many}} boxes--had come by a late train, and Mr. Lyons had sent word over to his house last night, {{and he had been}} over <b>there</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> by daybreak and had seen one of the boxes, and it was directed, all right, to the Crooked Creek Telegraph Company, and-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I will go at once," [...] Jethro agreed. [...] "There are two {{or three}} {{excursions}} she has been wanting to make, and I think I can promise that she shall go {{on one of them}} to-day. If she says anything about wanting to go to see her pets before starting, I can say that you have both been <b>there</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and seen after them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} had better go and see him, Clinton. Your brother {{probably}} did not leave the house until twelve o'clock, though he may have gone at eleven. But whether eleven or twelve it makes no difference. No doubt he posted the letter he speaks of the first thing on leaving; but, you see, it is a cross post to your place, and the letter could not anyhow have got <b>there</b> for delivery <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> You can hardly explain it all by telegram; and I think, as I said, it is better that you should go yourself. I will have breakfast put for you in my study, and I will have a fly at the door. You {{will be able to}} catch the eight-o'clock train into Gloucester, and you should be home by eleven." ...|$|R
60|$|When we {{got here}} last Saturday night, we found that Mrs. Fields had not only garnished the rooms with flowers, but also with holly (with real red berries) and {{festoons}} of moss dependent from the looking-glasses and picture frames. She {{is one of the}} dearest little women in the world. The homely Christmas look of the place quite affected us. Yesterday we dined at her house, and there was a plum-pudding, brought on blazing, and not to be surpassed in any house in England. There is a certain Captain Dolliver, belonging to the Boston Custom House, who came off in the little steamer that brought me ashore from the Cuba. He took it into his head that he would have a piece of English mistletoe brought out in this week's Cunard, which should be laid upon my breakfast-table. And <b>there</b> it was <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> In such affectionate touches as this, these New England people are especially amiable.|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, [...] "I do {{not know}} her; but I have seen her often, and I know all about her family. They seem to be of such little consequence, {{one way or the}} other, that I can {{scarcely}} understand how things could so twist themselves that you should consider it necessary to go back <b>there</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> before you really started on your day's journey." ...|$|E
6000|$|CZAR. What did you say, boy? tyranny! tyranny! Am I a tyrant? I'm not. I {{love the}} people. I'm their father. I'm called so in every {{official}} proclamation. Have a care, boy; have a care. You don't {{seem to be}} cured yet of your foolish tongue. (Goes over to PRINCE PAUL, and {{puts his hand on}} his shoulder.) Prince Paul, tell me were there many people <b>there</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to see the Nihilists hung? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miles," [...] said Lucy, as {{she rose}} from the table, tears {{trembling}} on her eyelids as she spoke, [...] "half an hour hence come to the family room. Grace wishes to see you <b>there</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and I {{have not been able}} to deny her request. She is weak, but thinks the visit will do her good. Do not fail to be punctual, as waiting might distress her. Good morning, dearest papa; when I want you, I will send for you." ...|$|E

60|$|In this perilous predicament, indeed, {{he found}} himself placed between hope and despair--but {{certainly}} the latter was by much the most predominant feeling of his mind--situate upon a sunken rock {{in the middle of}} the ocean, which, in the progress of the flood-tide, was to be laid under water to the depth of at least twelve feet in a stormy sea. <b>There</b> were <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> thirty-two persons in all upon the rock, with only two boats, whose complement, even in good weather, did not exceed twenty-four sitters; but to row to the floating light with so much wind, and in so heavy a sea, a complement of eight men for each boat was as much as could, with propriety, be attempted, so that, in this way, about one-half of our number was unprovided for. Under these circumstances, had the writer ventured to despatch one of the boats in expectation of either working the Smeaton sooner up towards the rock, or in hopes of getting her boat brought to our assistance, this must have given an immediate alarm to the artificers, each of whom would have insisted upon taking to his own boat, and leaving the eight artificers belonging to the Smeaton to their chance. Of course a scuffle might have ensued, and it is hard to say, in the ardour of men contending for life, where it might have ended. It has even been hinted to the writer that a party of the pickmen were determined to keep exclusively to their own boat against all hazards.|$|R
6000|$|... "But not <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Some other day. I--I--I want {{to think}} about Mrs. Maynard. I--ought n't to leave her. Excuse me <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> Mr. Libby." ...|$|R
