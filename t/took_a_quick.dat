5|$|Against Georgia, most critics thought Maryland faced {{its first}} true test. In the first quarter, the Terrapins <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> 14–0 lead {{and held the}} Bulldogs to six {{offensive}} plays, two of which were punts. In the second quarter, Georgia quarterback Zeke Bratkowski led his team to two consecutive touchdown drives, and the score was 21–13 in favor of Maryland at halftime. Two minutes into the third quarter, Faloney intercepted a Bratkowski pass and returned it for a touchdown. Bratkowski {{was taken out of}} the game after numerous sacks by Stan Jones and Bob Morgan. The 40–13 final result would be the most points the Terrapins allowed during the entire season.|$|E
5|$|Before the kickoff, seven Maryland players, {{including}} six starters, received partial-game suspensions {{for violating the}} team's curfew. Maryland <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> lead within the first two minutes of play, but repeated errors allowed Nevada to remain competitive and the lead changed hands five times. In the second quarter, Nevada's dual-threat quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, was hobbled by an ankle injury that altered the complexion of the game. Nevertheless, Kaepernick remained in the game for almost its entirety {{and was able to}} scramble for a touchdown. Halfway through the third quarter, Maryland's leading running back, Da'Rel Scott, made his first appearance of the game. He {{had been one of the}} suspended players, but scored twice in the final quarter to help secure a victory for the Terrapins.|$|E
5|$|The Mets <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> 2–0 {{lead with}} a single by Rickey Henderson to open the game {{followed}} immediately by a home run by Edgardo Alfonzo. They added to this lead in the third as Alfonzo drew a walk and then John Olerud hit a double which advanced Alfonzo to third base. Reds starter Steve Parris intentionally walked Mike Piazza to load the bases and was relieved by Denny Neagle. However, Neagle then walked Robin Ventura to score Alfonzo and extend the lead to 3–0. Neagle remained {{in the game and}} yielded a home run to Henderson to lead off the fifth inning for the Mets' fourth run. Neagle then loaded the bases with two outs with walks to Piazza and Ventura followed by a Darryl Hamilton single, but escaped the inning without further scoring. The Reds pinch hit for Neagle {{in the bottom of the}} fifth, and Danny Graves entered for them to pitch the sixth inning. Graves walked Rey Ordóñez to leadoff the inning, Mets starter Al Leiter sacrifice bunted Ordóñez to second, and following an out he scored on a double by Alfonzo. Graves remained in the game until Mark Lewis pinch hit for him in the eighth and Dennys Reyes relieved him in the ninth. Graves and Reyes held the score steady after the sixth but the Reds' offense did not score against Al Leiter and the Mets won the game, and with it the Wild Card, 5–0.|$|E

25|$|In Game6, Boston <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> 2–0 lead on RBI base {{hits from}} Dwight Evans and Marty Barrett. The Mets tied the {{score in the}} fifth inning on a single from Ray Knight and a run-scoring double play by Danny Heep (his last at-bat ever as a Met). An error by Knight led to Barrett scoring in the seventh to give Boston a 3–2 lead.|$|E

Knott and Tony Greig ran two overthrows before Andy Roberts, fielding at square-leg, retrieved the ball and threw it past the stumps at the bowler's end and over the long-off boundary for four more runs.|$|E
25|$|The Giants <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> lead in Game 6 with outfielder Kenji Yano's bases-loaded single which {{produced}} two {{runs in the}} bottom of the first inning. Fighters starter Masaru Takeda was quickly pulled from the game after the second inning in which he allowed a third Giants run off of Hisayoshi Chono's solo home run, his second of the series. Heading into the top of the sixth inning, the Fighters were down 3–0 when Sho Nakata hit a three-run home run to tie the game.|$|E

25|$|The Bears {{played the}} Green Bay Packers, their {{longtime}} rivals, during week five. The game was a must-win {{situation for the}} Bears, who needed a win to preserve any chance of winning the division. The Packers entered {{the game with a}} 4–0 record, but suffered their first lost of the season {{at the hands of a}} staunch Bears defense. The Packers <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> lead as DeShawn Wynn rushed for over sixty yards and scored a touchdown on the team's opening drive. Cedric Benson responded by scoring a rushing touchdown, but the Packers broke the tie when Brett Favre threw a touchdown pass to Greg Jennings.|$|E
25|$|Rick Porcello {{remained}} perfect at {{home and}} earned his major league leading 18th win. In another late inning meltdown, the Rays scored {{three times in the}} seventh and eighth inning to take game two of the series.

In the bottom of the fifth, Hanley Ramírez elevated a ball over the Green Monster for his first grand slam of the season. Jackie Bradley Jr. extended the lead with a solo shot. All six Red Sox runs to this point came by the long ball. After striking out the final batter in the seventh, Fernando Abad handed Junichi Tazawa a bases loaded situation with two outs. The Rays tied the game on a single. With a second late inning meltdown in a row looming, the bats stepped up with three consecutive, one-out hits to score Hanley Ramírez and Brock Holt. Craig Kimbrel earned the save on ten pitches.|$|E
25|$|The Bison {{football}} team, which since 1993 {{played their}} home {{games at the}} Fargodome, was a dominant force in Division II. They have won 13 NCAA National titles. Eight were at the Division II level (1965, 1968, 1969, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1988, and 1990) before moving up to Division I-AA (now FCS) in 2004 where they have won five national championships (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015). NDSU is the only team at any level of NCAA football to have won five straight national championships. The program was the winningest {{in the history of}} the NCAA Division II North Central Conference, with 17 outright championships and 27 total league football titles. The program has also been quite successful since moving up to the D1 FCS classification. In 2006 the Bison posted a 10–1 record that included a win over FBS Ball State. During a 2006 game against FBS Minnesota, NDSU led for much of the game, but a last-second field goal attempt was blocked by Minnesota, resulting in a 10–9 loss. The following season, the Bison won their first Great West Football Conference championship and achieved the number 1 ranking in major FCS polls for a majority of the season. During this season the 2007 Bison football team defeated FBS members Central Michigan University and the University of Minnesota. In 2010 the Bison defeated the FBS Kansas Jayhawks, 6–3, for their first win over a Big 12 program. The Bison won the 2011 FCS national championship, defeating Sam Houston State University, 17–6. The 2011 title was their ninth overall. The Bison returned to the FCS championship game in 2012 and soundly defeated Sam Houston State University in a rematch of the 2011 title game, 39–13. Expectations were high entering the 2013 season. The season commenced with a game against the Kansas State Wildcats, the reigning Big 12 Champions. The Bison <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> lead, but let a 7–7 halftime score get away from them; trailing 21–7 in the third quarter. The Bison finished the game with an 18-play 80-yard drive that used 8 1/2 minutes, leaving 28 seconds on the clock for the Wildcats, trailing by 3. NDSU Linebacker Grant Olson intercepted the first pass attempt by the Wildcats, sealing their 7th win over FBS teams since their move to FCS. ESPN College GameDay broadcast an episode from Fargo. The Bison finished the season 15–0 with a victory over the Towson Tigers, 35–7. Despite a cast of new coaches, the 2014 Bison finished the season with a 15–1 record, including another win over Big 12 Iowa State and won their fourth consecutive national championship. ESPN College GameDay was broadcast from Fargo for the 2nd consecutive year.|$|E

500|$|On 30 April, the Soviets {{were less}} than [...] from the bunker. That afternoon, Hitler and Eva Braun {{committed}} suicide fewer than 40 hours after they were married.

After the door was opened, Misch only <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> [...] "glance". He saw Eva, with her legs drawn up, to Hitler's left on the sofa. Her eyes were open and she was dead. Hitler was also dead. He was either sitting on the sofa or in the armchair by it; his head [...] "had fallen forward slightly". Misch started to leave to report the events to Schädle, but then stopped and returned to the door of Hitler's study. By then Misch observed that Hitler's corpse had been removed from inside the study and wrapped in a blanket. Several men then picked it up and carried it past him. Misch left and reported the events to Schädle, who instructed him to return to his duty station. After returning to the telephone exchange, Misch later recalled Unterscharführer Retzbach proclaiming [...] "So they're burning the boss now!" [...] Retzbach asked Misch if he was going upstairs to watch the events, but Misch declined to go. Thereafter, Günsche came down and told Misch that the corpses of Hitler and Braun had been burned in the garden of the Reich Chancellery.|$|E
500|$|Themistocles died at Magnesia in 459BC, {{at the age}} of 65, {{according}} to Thucydides, from natural causes. However, perhaps inevitably, there were also rumours surrounding his death; that finding that he could not keep the promises that he had made to the king, he committed suicide by taking poison, or drinking bull's blood. Plutarch provides the most evocative version of this story:"But when Egypt revolted with Athenian aid...and Cimon's mastery of the sea forced the King to resist the efforts of the Hellenes and to hinder their hostile growth...messages came down to Themistocles saying that the King commanded him to make good his promises by applying himself to the Hellenic problem; then, neither embittered by anything like anger against his former fellow-citizens, nor lifted up by the great honor and power he was to have in the war, but possibly thinking his task not even approachable, both because Hellas had other great generals at the time, and especially because Cimon was so marvelously successful in his campaigns; yet most of all out of regard for the reputation of his own achievements and the trophies of those early days; having decided that his best course was to put a fitting end to his life, he made a sacrifice to the gods, then called his friends together, gave them a farewell clasp of his hand, and, as the current story goes, drank bull's blood, or as some say, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> poison, and so died in Magnesia, in the sixty-fifth year of his life...They say that the King, on learning the cause and the manner of his death, admired the man yet more, and continued to treat his friends and kindred with kindness." ...|$|E
