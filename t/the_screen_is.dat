5|$|The first {{adaptation}} of Hellblazer ever filmed for <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} scenes in the documentary feature film The Mindscape of Alan Moore, which was shot in early 2002. The dramatization consists of the John Constantine character wandering through London and, in the film ending, experiencing a mystical epiphany of sorts.|$|E
5|$|A Gothic {{screen was}} also {{added to the}} Norman nave at Peterborough, {{but this is an}} {{architectural}} oddity with no precedent or successor. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> composed of three enormous open arches, the two outer ones being much wider than that which frames the central door. The overwhelming composition is somewhat spoilt by the later porch and the fact that two towers of very different height pop up from behind the screen. Despite this, it is {{regarded as one of the}} supreme masterpieces of Gothic, revealing the enormous diversity and imagination of English medieval architects.|$|E
5|$|Ferb {{was given}} a simplistic {{structure}} so that young audiences {{would be able to}} draw him easily. As with the other characters of Phineas and Ferb, Ferb's design is constructed of geometric shapes in homage to animator Tex Avery. Ferb's head is based on a rectangle with a wider top than bottom. A square is used for his nose, and an egg-shaped oval is used for his eyes. The eye furthest from <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> always drawn larger than the other. Povenmire uses a nine-step process to draw Ferb, starting with his head and ending with touch ups.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> {{dismantled}} {{and removed}} from the cathedral in 1967. The Herbert Art Gallery & Museum in Coventry purchased <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> but <b>was</b> unable to restore or display it, so in 1983 it {{was transferred to the}} Victoria and Albert Museum. Before conservation, <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> in almost 14,000 individual pieces, many of which were in very poor condition. Conservation of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> took thirteen months and cost over £800,000 which is, as of September 2011, the largest conservation project undertaken by the V <b>The</b> Hereford Choir <b>Screen</b> <b>is</b> now on display at the V ...|$|R
50|$|The {{top half}} of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> driving {{apparatus}} of player 1, and {{the bottom half of}} <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> driving apparatus for player 2. Instead of a map of the circuit, a graph in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> depicted <b>the</b> lap length and the relative distance between the two opponents.|$|R
5|$|Ono {{was also}} an {{experimental}} filmmaker who made 16 short films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply No. 4, {{often referred to as}} Bottoms. The five-and-a-half-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human buttocks walking on a treadmill. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the gluteal cleft and the horizontal gluteal crease. The soundtrack consists of interviews with those who are being filmed, as well as those considering joining the project. In 1996, the watch manufacturing company Swatch produced a limited edition watch that commemorated this film.|$|E
5|$|Special {{abilities}} are another {{important aspect of}} Chocobo Racing. Before each race, the player is prompted to assign a special ability to the selected character. During a race, the player can only activate the chosen special ability when the meter in the upper left-hand corner of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> full. After using the special ability, the player must wait for the meter to recharge to use it again.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{takes place}} in real-time. Located {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> a power bar, a gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy when attacking. Swinging a weapon causes the gauge to empty and then quickly recharge, {{allowing}} that character to attack at full strength. The party wields eight different types of weaponry: sword, spear, bow, axe, boomerang, glove, whip, and javelin. All weapons can be upgraded eight times, and repeated use of a weapon increases its skill level to a maximum of eight, unlocking a new special attack with each level. Weapons are upgraded with Weapon Orbs, which are found in dungeons or earned by defeating certain bosses. The player takes each Orb to a blacksmith, located in most towns, who uses it to reforge one weapon.|$|E
40|$|A failed Johnson <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> sent to <b>the</b> {{laboratory}} for analysis. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> {{found to have}} failed at the flange hub – screen joint. Analysis showed that the failure was due to inadequate welding of the flange hub with the ribs/stiffeners of <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> <b>The</b> failure <b>was</b> by sudden overload. There were no indications of delayed failure like fatigue or stress corrosion cracking. Semi-quantitative analysis by EDX showed that the helical coil of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> made of SS 304 steel while the ribs/stiffener were made of SS 316 steel...|$|R
50|$|Inside {{the church}} is a Minton tiled reredos which may date from the 1861 rebuilding. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> deisgned by Frederick Charles Eden and {{installed}} in 1912 while carrying out other work on the church. Because of local objections <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> never painted. <b>The</b> 12th century cylindrical font dates from the 12th century.|$|R
50|$|Big <b>Screen</b> Derby <b>was</b> {{installed}} in 2007. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> {{a partnership between}} the BBC, Derby City Council, the University of Derby and LOCOG and was located in the Market Place next to the Assembly Rooms. In early September 2013, <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> removed by Derby City Council in a cost-cutting exercise, although its return in some form has not been ruled out.|$|R
5|$|Qwak! was {{released}} in a standard upright arcade cabinet with {{a black and white}} raster television monitor inset, with the rifle holster and start button below as the only controls. The reeds and tree branch overlay is screen printed in color onto a clear panel in front of the monitor, and is backlit by the screen; <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> lit with a gray background instead of a black one in order to produce this effect. When the gun is triggered, the duck additionally flashes white briefly, so as to be detected by the light gun; the relative brightness of the screen makes this effect less obvious than with other similar light gun games. Qwak! was not the first light gun video game; it was preceded by the arcade game Balloon Gun (August 1974) and a light gun game for the Magnavox Odyssey video game console (1972), as well as non-video game light gun games since the 1936 Seeberg Ray-O-Lite.|$|E
5|$|The main map (the upper {{two thirds}} of <b>the</b> <b>screen)</b> <b>is</b> divided into squares, on which players can {{establish}} bases, move units and engage in combat. Through terraforming, players may modify {{the effects of the}} individual map squares on movement, combat and resources. Resources are used to feed the population, construct units and facilities, and supply energy. Players can allocate energy between research into new technology and energy reserves. Unlike Civilization II, new technology grants access to additional unit components rather than pre-designed units, allowing players to design and re-design units as their factions' priorities shift. Energy reserves allow the player to upgrade units, maintain facilities, and attempt to win by the Global Energy Market scenario. Bases are military strongpoints and objectives that are vital for all winning strategies. They produce military units, house the population, collect energy, and build secret projects and Subspace Generators. Facilities and secret projects improve the performance of individual bases and of the entire faction.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{characters}} have different capabilities. Both {{are capable of}} using weapons and magic, but the hero is stronger with melee weapons and the heroine is stronger with ranged magical attacks. Weapons have three attributes: slash, jab, and bash; and different attributes cause more or less damage to different enemies. Magical spells can cause damage or defend the protagonists, and {{are affected by the}} weapon the character is holding. Combat takes place in real-time. Located at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> an overdrive gauge that increases by one point at each hit given to an enemy. When that gauge is full, the player can release a powerful attack that will deplete the gauge completely if the attack lands. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each character increases in level and improves in areas such as strength and evasion.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Pine Trees <b>screen</b> (Shōrin-zu byōbu) <b>is</b> {{a pair of}} six-panel folding <b>screens</b> (byōbu) by <b>the</b> Japanese artist Hasegawa Tōhaku. The precise {{date for}} <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> <b>is</b> not known, but they were clearly made in the late 16th century, in the Momoyama period, around 1595. <b>The</b> <b>screens</b> <b>are</b> held by <b>the</b> Tokyo National Museum, and were {{designated}} as a National Treasure of Japan in 1952.|$|R
50|$|Palace records {{suggest that}} <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> <b>were</b> {{constantly}} being produced. Today however, only around twenty originals remain. None are signed.

5|$|The unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely {{follows the}} styling of the {{original}} aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor, albeit wider and deeper due to the widescreen display. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> high-gloss, covered by an edge-to-edge reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option {{is available in the}} 15- and 17-inch models in which the glass panel is removed. The entire trackpad is usable and acts as a clickable button. The trackpad is also larger than the first generation model's, giving more room for scrolling and multi-touch gestures. When the line was updated in April 2010, inertial scrolling was added, making the scrolling experience much like that of the iPhone and iPad. The keys, still backlit, are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys.|$|E
5|$|Infamous is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective where the player controls Cole and primarily interacts {{with the world of}} Empire City through Cole's newly gained electricity-based powers; these are used for movement, offense and defense in combat, and either for better or worse in dealing with the citizens of Empire City. In order for Cole to use his powers, he must have stored electrical power, represented by a node meter on the player's heads up display (HUD). The player can recharge Cole by draining electricity from powered sources or from living beings; recharging also restores Cole's health, which is indicated by blood splattering onto the screen. The more damage that Cole takes, the more blood that covers the screen. When Cole's health is at a critical level, the screen will turn black and white, and if Cole takes a little bit more damage while <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> black and white, a heartbeat will be heard and will get slower and slower as Cole takes more damage, until it is beating dangerously slow. At this point, further damage to Cole will kill him. If the player stays out of battle long enough, Cole's health will regenerate over time. The game features seventeen different electrical powers, ranging from simple bolts that do not consume Cole's energy to wide-field lightning storms that drain most of Cole's energy. The player can use such powers, giving the player options in certain situations. For example, the player may fire at a generator near foes to cause it to explode and cripple his opponents, then restrain them or fire at the body to kill the enemy.|$|E
5|$|The third {{multiplayer}} mode is the Combat Simulator, involving {{up to four}} human {{players and}} eight computer-controlled players. Again, a split-screen is used if more than one human is playing. If three or four humans play, <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> divided into quarters, with one quarter left blank if necessary. Players enter the game unarmed and {{with a certain amount}} of health. Weapons and ammunition are placed around the level in preset positions. Once a player is killed, they are regenerated elsewhere in the level, once again unarmed. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from the traditional deathmatch mode, where players score points by killing their respective enemies, to objective-based games, such as Capture the Flag or King of the Hill. Other scenarios include Hold the Briefcase, where players must take a briefcase and survive with it for as long as possible, and Hacker Central, a gametype where players score points by hacking a computer system using a data uplink. Aspects of each game can be customised, including the chosen map, the weapons available, and the winning conditions. Players can also be grouped into teams or compete individually. In a team game, the players can optionally be shown coloured according to their team. Each game can be customised to a greater degree than was possible in GoldenEye 007s multiplayer mode, such as free weapons selection and placement of shields.|$|E

40|$|During the 1999 -crushing season, the Malelane Mill {{installed}} vibratory <b>screens</b> after <b>the</b> quadruple effect evaporator. The {{purpose of}} <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> <b>was</b> to separate out any residual scale originating from the chemical cleaning of the evaporator vessels. This strategy was adopted after attempts {{to improve the}} flush out of the evaporator vessels after chemical cleaning proved ineffective in removing all the scale. The underlying motivation behind <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> <b>was</b> to remove evaporator scale from the raw sugar that was destined for packaging, and which therefore compromised brown sugar quality.

25|$|In the 19th {{century the}} Scottish {{physicist}} James Clerk Maxwell {{found a new}} way of explaining colours, by the wavelength of their light. He showed that white light could be created by combining red, blue and green light, and that virtually all colours could be made by different combinations of these three colours. His idea, called additive colour or the RGB colour model, is used today to create colours on televisions and computer screens. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> covered by tiny pixels, each with three fluorescent elements for creating red, green and blue light. If the red, blue and green elements all glow at once, the pixel looks white. As <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> scanned from behind with electrons, each pixel creates its own designated colour, composing a complete picture on the screen.|$|E
