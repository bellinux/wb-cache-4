5|$|The {{interior}} of the <b>Tumbler</b> was an immobile studio set and not actually the {{interior of}} a street-capable <b>Tumbler.</b> The cockpit was oversized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the <b>Tumbler</b> interior. In addition, another version of the <b>Tumbler</b> was a miniature model that was 1:6 scale of the actual <b>Tumbler.</b> This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show the <b>Tumbler</b> flying across ravines and between buildings. However, the actual <b>Tumbler</b> was used for the waterfall sequence.|$|E
5|$|Crowley {{started the}} process of {{designing}} the <b>Tumbler</b> for the film by model bashing. Crowley used the nose cone of a P-38 Lightning model {{to serve as the}} chassis for the Tumbler's turbine engine. Six models of the <b>Tumbler</b> were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the <b>Tumbler</b> out of a large block of Styrofoam in two months.|$|E

British Columbia's largest and smallest district municipalities are Langley and Wells with populations of 117,285 and 217 respectively. The fastest-growing district municipality in British Columbia is Invermere, which grew 14.8% between 2011 and 2016, while the fastest-shrinking is <b>Tumbler</b> Ridge, which shrunk by 26.7%.|$|E
25|$|In The Dark Knight Rises (2012), several <b>Tumblers</b> are seen. Each {{of these}} {{vehicles}} has the <b>Tumbler's</b> original military camouflage and is stolen from Wayne Enterprises by Bane's gang. The stolen <b>Tumblers</b> {{are used in}} Bane's attempt to control Gotham and are notably seen when the mass of police and criminals are about to battle. One of the <b>Tumblers</b> fires at the crowd of police, only for the Bat to intercept the shot. Three of the <b>Tumblers</b> are destroyed by Batman using the Bat and Selina Kyle using the Batpod.|$|R

5|$|Company towns {{were once}} common in British Columbia. Many were large, but never had {{municipal}} government and were largely located on company-owned land. A few such as Granisle, <b>Tumbler</b> Ridge and Wells became municipalities, {{while others have}} become ghost towns. Among the largest were Anyox, Bralorne, Ocean Falls, Cassiar, Gold Harbour (Tasu) and Kitsault.|$|E
5|$|Mentmore Towers {{was chosen}} from twenty {{different}} locations for Wayne Manor, as Nolan and Crowley liked its white floors, {{which gave the}} impression of the manor as a memorial to Wayne's parents. The building chosen to represent Arkham Asylum was the National Institute for Medical Research building in Mill Hill, northwest London, England. The St Pancras railway station and the Abbey Mills Pumping Stations were used for Arkham's interiors. University College London was used for courtrooms. Some scenes, including the <b>Tumbler</b> pursuit, were filmed in Chicago at locations such as Lower Wacker Drive and 35 East Wacker. Authorities agreed to raise Franklin Street Bridge for a scene where access to the Narrows is closed.|$|E
5|$|The 1941 census, {{the first}} to include Dawson Creek as a defined subdivision, counted 518 residents. Its growth spurred by the {{construction}} of the Alaska Highway, the town recorded a sevenfold increase to 3,589 residents in the 1951 census. Within five years, the population doubled to 7,531. New transport links with southern British Columbia and Alberta spurred continued growth into the next decade. The population peaked in 1966 at 12,392, then declined throughout the 1970s, rising again briefly during {{the construction of the}} nearby town of <b>Tumbler</b> Ridge in the early 1980s. Dawson Creek's population has remained relatively stable since then. Between 2005 and 2009, the population rose from 10,869 to 11,514, per provincial estimates.|$|E

5|$|Alternate {{designs for}} the {{standard}} Batmobile include ones based on the 1960s TV series; a prototype version; 1970s Batman-themed; Robin-themed; Riddler-themed; and Rocksteady-themed. All-new, drivable Batmobiles include: the 1989 film, <b>Tumbler,</b> 1960s TV series, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and the original Arkham Asylum Batmobiles. These Batmobiles do not feature a tank mode and can only {{be used in the}} main game after all tanks have been eliminated or on specific Batmobile challenge maps. In terms of design, the 1989 film and 1960 TV series ones are longer and narrower with better handling than the standard Arkham Knight Batmobile. Racetracks for the Batmobile include two based on Batman and Batman Returns; two based on The Dark Knight; two based on the 1960s TV series; and two WayneTech tracks.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{rejected}} Batman origin story reboot Joss Whedon {{pitched in}} December 2002, Warner Bros. hired Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer to script Batman Begins. The duo aimed for a darker and more realistic tone, with humanity and realism being {{the basis of}} the film. The film was primarily shot in the United Kingdom and Chicago, and relied on traditional stunts and scale models with minimal use of computer-generated imagery. Christian Bale starred as Batman, Liam Neeson starred as Ra's al Ghul, and Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow. Katie Holmes also starred in the movie as Bruce's love interest, Rachel Dawes, a role created for the film. Alfred, the ex-British Army SAS member was played by Michael Caine and Jim Gordon was portrayed by Gary Oldman. A new Batmobile (called the <b>Tumbler)</b> and a more mobile Batsuit were both created specifically for the film. The film begins with the death of Bruce's parents and then explores his decision to leave Gotham and his training under the League of Assassins with Ra's al Ghul, before he rebels against the League and adopts the guise of Batman, recognising that he cannot condone their use of lethal force. The League attempt to attack Gotham using Jonathan Crane's weaponised fear toxin, but Batman is able to defeat their plan, with Ra's being apparently killed when a train he is in crashes during a fight with Batman.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to earlier}} {{recurring}} issues with mistranslations related to news updates, the team {{decided not to}} implement forums in the original release, instead hearing player feedback through fan sites and unofficial forums. Also because of mistranslation fears, dedicated teams {{in each of the}} game's release regions would gather feedback and transmit it to the development team. The game's first closed Alpha test began on March 11, 2010. It was available only to veteran players from XI. During alpha testing, the team used player feedback to find out key problems with the game, such as limitations on graphical adjustments making the game run at a slow frame rate. The open Beta test was originally scheduled to begin on August 31, but was indefinitely postponed due to the discovery of critical bugs in the game. The Beta test eventually went live on September 2, running until the game's release later that month. It was later stated that more time should have been given to fixing bugs during the Beta period. The game released on September 30, 2010, six months prior to the PS3 version's projected release date of March 2011. A Collector's Edition was released on September 22, allowing owners to log into the game from that date. The Collector's Edition, which was decorated by artwork from Amano and Yoshida, came with bonus items including a DVD featuring a behind-the-scenes documentary, a security token, a case for the game's box, and a decorated <b>tumbler.</b> The game was released with text in Japanese, English, French and German, while the spoken dialogue in cutscenes was English in all versions.|$|E

40|$|Monodisperse and bidisperse {{granular}} flows are {{studied in}} rotating <b>tumblers</b> using DEM. In spherical <b>tumblers,</b> flowing particles’ trajectories {{do not follow}} straight lines but are curved. At the same time particles near the surface drift toward the pole, inducing two global recirculation cells. Combined with radial segregation, drift and curvature compete to impose the axial segregation pattern: Small-Large-Small (SLS) or Large-Small-Large (LSL). Fill level, rotation speed and wall roughness influence drift and curvature, and modify the resulting segregation pattern. In cylindrical <b>tumblers,</b> equivalent recirculation cells occur next to the end walls. A second pair of recirculation cells with a weak drift {{in the opposite direction}} appears at the center for long enough <b>tumblers.</b> Unlike the sphere case, curvature and drift in the primary cells combine to push large particles toward the end walls, explaining why large particle bands appear at the end walls for axial segregation in cylinder...|$|R

The <b>Tumbler</b> is also seen in the trailers in a deleted scene, exiting the improvised Batcave.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of rock tumbling: barrel (rotary) tumbling, and {{vibratory}} tumbling. Rotary tumbling is more common, simpler, quieter and less expensive than vibratory tumblers. There are two differentiating factors, however, that may lead one to use a vibratory <b>tumbler.</b> First, vibratory <b>tumbler</b> retain the overall shape of the rough rock, whereas rotary tumblers tend to make rocks round. Thus, {{it is important to}} use vibratory <b>tumbler</b> to make faceted shapes and tear drop forms. Second, vibratory tumblers tend to process much faster than rotary tumblers, generally reducing the process time to half.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} piece of equipment in the process is the <b>tumbler.</b> It is constructed of steel or stainless steel and lined with an acid and abrasion resistant material, such as neoprene, polypropylene, and polybutylene. The barrel sizes range from , however the working volume is only 25 to 35% of the total volume. For most plating applications the <b>tumbler</b> is rotated at 60RPM, however it can vary. If the speed is too fast then lumpy deposits will form on the workpieces, but if the speed is too slow then the metal powder will not deposit onto the workpiece.|$|E

25|$|When {{previously}} fired {{cases are}} used, {{they must be}} inspected before loading. Cases that are dirty or tarnished are often polished in a <b>tumbler</b> to remove oxidation and allow easier inspection of the case. Cleaning in a <b>tumbler</b> will also clean the interior of cases, which is often considered important for handloading high-precision target rounds. Cracked necks, non-reloadable cases (steel, aluminum, or Berdan primed cases), and signs of head separation are all reasons to reject a case. Cases are measured for length, and any that are over the recommended length are trimmed down to the minimum length. Competition shooters will also sort cases by brand and weight to ensure consistency.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} of not showing the ping-pong balls live has fueled {{speculation that the}} NBA will occasionally fix the draft lottery if it can benefit the league. The speculation originated with the 1985 draft lottery that sent Patrick Ewing to New York, with the theory being that the NBA wanted to send {{the best player in}} the draft to New York to increase ratings in a large television market. At that time, the NBA used 7 envelopes in a <b>tumbler</b> representing the seven teams with the worst record. Some have speculated that the envelope containing the Knicks logo was refrigerated beforehand, enabling David Stern to recognize and select it. Another conspiracy theory suggests that one of the seven envelopes was thrown into the <b>tumbler,</b> causing one of the corners to fold. After the envelopes were mixed, Stern took a deep breath before reaching into the <b>tumbler</b> and picking the envelope with the folded corner. No one has ever explained why all the other teams would go along with the fix. Afterward, the Draft Lottery Format was changed to the current ping-pong ball lottery in a private room with team representatives. However, despite the lack of any evidence, conspiracy theories still persist regarding the annual outcome of the lottery.|$|E

40|$|We present both {{a review}} of earlier data and new results on non-principal axis rotators (<b>tumblers)</b> among asteroids. Among new <b>tumblers</b> found, the best data we have are for 2002 TD 60, 2000 WL 107, and (54789) 2001 MZ 7 —each of them shows a lightcurve with two {{frequencies}} (full terms with linear {{combinations of the two}} frequencies are present in the lightcurve). For 2002 TD 60, we have constructed a physical model of the NPA rotation. Other recent objects which {{have been found to be}} likely <b>tumblers</b> based on their lightcurves that do not fit with a single periodicity are 2002 NY 40, (16067) 1999 RH 27, and (5645) 1990 SP. We have done a statistical analysis of the present sample of the population of NPA rotators. It appears that most asteroids larger than 0. 4 km with estimated damping timescales (Harris, 1994, Icarus 107, 209) of 4. 5 byr and longer are NPA rotators. The statistic of two short-period <b>tumblers</b> (D = 0. 04 and 0. 4 km) with non-zero tensile strength suggests that for them the quantity μQ/T, where μ is the mechanical rigidity, Q is the elastic dissipation factor, and T is a spin excitation age (i. e., a time elapsed since the last significant spin excitation event), is greater by two to four orders of magnitude than the larger, likely rubble-pile <b>tumblers.</b> Among observational conditions and selection effects affecting detections of NPA rotations, there is a bias against detection of low-amplitude (small elongation) <b>tumblers...</b>|$|R
