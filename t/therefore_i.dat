5|$|As I {{made clear}} in my {{telegram}} to the FIDE delegates, the match conditions I proposed were non-negotiable. Mr. Cramer informs {{me that the}} rules of the winner being the first player to win ten games, draws not counting, unlimited number of games and if nine wins to nine match is drawn with champion regaining title and prize fund split equally were rejected by the FIDE delegates. By so doing FIDE has decided against my participation in the 1975 World Chess Championship. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>I</b> resign my FIDE World Chess Championship title. Sincerely, Bobby Fischer.|$|E

5|$|One other point, already mentioned, {{was how to}} {{deal with}} the problem of {{rendering}} the poem’s fourth line. Gray remarked to Anstey, “’That leaves the world to darkness and to me’ is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and <b>therefore,</b> <b>I</b> believe, you were in the right to drop it.” In fact, all that Anstey had dropped was reproducing an example of zeugma with a respectable Classical history, but only in favour of replicating the same understated introduction of the narrator into the scene: et solus sub nocte relinqor (and I alone am left under the night). Some other translators, with other priorities, found elegant means to render the original turn of speech exactly.|$|E
5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and <b>therefore</b> <b>I</b> cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E

25|$|The {{basic problem}} is that the {{constructor}} is a peculiar function; when it starts off, there is no object, only raw memory.

25|$|In 1939, I {{was officially}} demanded {{to join the}} National Socialist Party. At this time I was already Technical Director at the Army Rocket Center at Peenemünde (Baltic Sea).
