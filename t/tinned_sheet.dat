40|$|In {{this highly}} {{competitive}} market where {{the demand for}} the products is increasing gradually, {{it is essential for}} a manufacturing company to reduce the production cycle time and cost accordingly. One of the methods for this is to increase the availability of process. This paper attempts to identify and quantify the causes of machine downtime in a manufacturing company. For this a four-prong approach is taken: Firstly, the major causes for the low availability of process are determined, where bearing failure is found to be the major causes of low availability. Second, combining desirability function approach and data envelopment analysis are performed to identify the sensitive input variables that affect the bearing failure. Thirdly, ordinary linear regression is used to validate the results of DEA. Lastly, some managerial implications to reduce the downtime were suggested. We have considered an electrolytic tinplating line process in a <b>tin</b> <b>sheet</b> manufacturing company as a case study. data envelopment analysis; DEA; linear regression; machine availability; machine downtime; desirability function; bottleneck identification; bottlenecks; manufacturing equipment; bearing failure; electrolytic tinplating; <b>tin</b> <b>sheet</b> manufacturing. ...|$|R

50|$|The most {{critical}} elements of any tubular grate heater are: 1) Safety - construction material and method, design and features. 2) Material - quality steel that enhances thermal conductivity, is safe (e.g. galvanized steel sweats lead), and resists thermal deterioration (e.g., <b>tin</b> <b>sheet</b> metal offers little resistance against thermal deterioration). 3) BTU rating - {{the combination of}} the unit's fire burning efficiency and the system's ability to deliver high-volume, high-temperature forced air heating into your home.|$|R

Eleven delegates from Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and Tennessee met for four days.

5000|$|Employer hostility was not {{the only}} obstacle: The fact that some {{branches}} of the trade were falling while others were rising also complicated the early union’s plans. In the late 19th century assortment work - tinware that included household goods, cutlery, and cans, for instance - moved from shop to factory, and machine operators replaced apprentice-trained journeymen on the job. At the same time, though, the increasing use of galvanized sheet iron was creating opportunities for journeymen employed in furnace or architectural shops - demand for metal roofs, cornices, skylights, and ceilings, along with warm air furnaces and ventilation pipe, was on the rise by the late 19th century. In their case, labor-saving machinery, including sheet iron folders, or brakes, and cutting, rolling, and seaming machines, did not replace skill. But it did give rise to a new class of workmen that the <b>Tin,</b> <b>Sheet</b> Iron and Cornice Workers could not ignore: Semi-skilled specialists who produced materials for the trade. Although many local unions feared that admitting lower-waged members would undercut journeymen’s wages, a referendum vote in 1896 moved the organization forward. “The constitution of the tinners has been changed so as to admit all who work at sheet metal work into their unions,” the IA reported.” Henceforth, the <b>Tin,</b> <b>Sheet</b> Iron, and Cornice Workers’ International Association will be known as the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association.” ...|$|R
