5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{there has}} been an anthropocentric {{tendency}} to emphasize the study of animal psychopathologies as models for human mental illnesses.

This article provides a non-exhaustive list of animal psychopathologies.|$|E
25|$|Likewise Isenkrahe's {{violation}} of the energy conservation law is unacceptable, and Kelvin's application of Clausius' theorem leads (as noted by Kelvin himself) <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of perpetual motion mechanism. The suggestion of a secondary re-radiation mechanism for wave models attracted the interest of JJ Thomson, but was not taken very seriously by either Maxwell or Poincaré, because it entails a gross {{violation of}} the second law of thermodynamics (huge amounts of energy spontaneously being converted from a colder to a hotter form), {{which is one of}} the most solidly established of all physical laws.|$|E
25|$|Several Deputies and {{high-ranking}} {{civil servants}} {{were of the}} opinion that Luxembourg could retain a measure of autonomy under the military administration, as had occurred in World War I, and attempts were made to come <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of arrangement with Germany. However, it was soon made clear by the authorities in Berlin that Luxembourg's fate would be very different this time. The Nazis considered the Luxembourgish people as just another Germanic ethnic group and the Grand Duchy a German territory. The military authorities had to leave Luxembourg by 31 July 1940, {{to be replaced by a}} civil administration under Gustav Simon.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s and early 1940s, Edsel—who was {{president}} of the company—thought Ford had to come <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of collective bargaining agreement with the unions because the violence, work disruptions, and bitter stalemates could not go on forever. But Ford, who still had the final veto in the company on a de facto basis even if not an official one, refused to cooperate. For several years, he kept Bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the Ford Motor Company. Sorensen's memoir makes clear that Ford's purpose in putting Bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached.|$|E
25|$|In 1921 Larramendi seemed already {{overwhelmed}} by mounting problems; another one were rumors about negotiations related <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of dynastic accord, allegedly conducted by Don Jaime with the Alfonsist branch; Larramendi {{has always been}} fiercely hostile to any compromise with the despised Liberal dynasty. He arranged for another grand meeting; it took place in Lourdes, though due to lower attendance and minor scale of discussions taking place it was rather an operational session than a milestone comparable to the Biarritz amassment; it provided Larramendi with little assistance. Soon afterwards the claimant left for Colombia with hardly any guidance or information passed to his delegate in Spain; upon his return, {{in the summer of}} 1921, Larramendi handed his resignation. When discussing its background, some scholars claim he was tired of uphill struggle; others point to talks with the Alfonsists and general Don Jaime’s detachment or Larramendi’s remorse about the 1920 electoral disaster.|$|E
25|$|While {{dealing with}} crisis, both {{personal}} and societal, there are five basic principles outlined for intervention. Victims are initially {{at high risk for}} maladaptive coping or immobilization. Intervening as quickly as possible is imperative. Resource mobilization should be immediately enacted in order to provide victims with the tools they need to return <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of order and normalcy, in addition to enable eventual independent functioning. The next step is to facilitate understanding of the event by processing the situation or trauma. This is done in order to help the victim {{gain a better understanding of}} what has occurred and allowing him or her to express feeling about the experience. Additionally, the counselor should assist the victim(s) in problem solving within the context of their situation and feelings. This is necessary for developing self-efficacy and self-reliance. Helping the victim get back to being able to function independently by actively facilitating problem solving, assisting in developing appropriate strategies for addressing those concerns, and in helping putting those strategies into action. This is done in hopes of assisting the victim to become self-reliant.|$|E

25|$|Often, {{people with}} dysthymia will seek out {{treatment}} not necessarily because of depressed mood, but rather due to increasing {{levels of stress}} or because of personal difficulties that may be situation-related. This is hypothesized to be because of the chronic nature of the disorder, and how depressed mood is often {{thought to be a}} characterological pattern for the individual with the condition. Thus, it is only when the person experiences increasing stress that he or she thinks to go <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of trained professional for symptom relief. It is usually through the administration of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV that dysthymia is first diagnosed. At this point, {{with the help of a}} trained professional, a certain line of treatment is often discussed and then selected. It is important to consider all factors in the person's life that may be affected when deciding on a particular course of treatment. Additionally, if one method of treatment does not particularly work for a certain individual, it may be helpful to try something else.|$|E
25|$|Early {{on in the}} {{development}} of its nuclear weapons, the United States relied in part on information-sharing with both the United Kingdom and Canada, as codified in the Quebec Agreement of 1943. These three parties agreed not to share nuclear weapons information with other countries without the consent of the others, an early attempt at nonproliferation. After {{the development}} of the first nuclear weapons during World War II, though, there was much debate within the political circles and public sphere of the United States {{about whether or not the}} country should attempt to maintain a monopoly on nuclear technology, or whether it should undertake a program of information sharing with other nations (especially its former ally and likely competitor, the Soviet Union), or submit control of its weapons <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of international organization (such as the United Nations) who would use them to attempt to maintain world peace. Though fear of a nuclear arms race spurred many politicians and scientists to advocate some degree of international control or sharing of nuclear weapons and information, many politicians and members of the military believed that it was better in the short term to maintain high standards of nuclear secrecy and to forestall a Soviet bomb as long as possible (and they did not believe the USSR would actually submit to international controls in good faith).|$|E
