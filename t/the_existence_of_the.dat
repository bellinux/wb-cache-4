30|$|<b>The</b> <b>existence</b> {{probability}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{target is}} estimated through an SD {{value of each}} classified scene, thereby presenting {{the possibility that a}} single scene contains the targets. After extracting the outlier information in the scene, the estimation measures original and predicted saliencies. The original SD value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scene means <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scene with potential targets, whereas the predicted SD value derived after excluding the outliers means the probability without targets. Thereafter, a comparison between the two SD values shows <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> targets.|$|R
