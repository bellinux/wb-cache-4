5|$|As well {{as being}} added, forces can also be {{resolved}} into independent components {{at right angles to}} each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, <b>the</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of <b>the</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is {{in the same direction as}} one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.|$|E
5|$|Filters are {{required}} to operate at many different frequencies, impedances and bandwidths. The utility of a prototype filter comes from the property that all these other filters {{can be derived from}} it by applying a scaling factor to <b>the</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prototype. The filter design need thus only be carried out once in full, with other filters being obtained by simply applying a scaling factor.|$|E

In cren- and thaumarchaea, however, the cell division machinery Cdv fulfills a similar role. This machinery is related to the eukaryotic ESCRT-III machinery which, while best known for its role in cell sorting, also has been seen to fulfill a role in separation between divided cell, suggesting an ancestral role in cell division.|$|E

5|$|Immunodeficiencies {{occur when}} {{one or more}} of <b>the</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immune system are inactive. The ability of the immune system to respond to {{pathogens}} is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is {{the most common cause of}} immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, local {{production}} of the F-20 was discussed with India. A move was also made in the 1980s to market the aircraft to the Pakistan Air Force with a license production manufacture of the aircraft.

Of <b>the</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> F-20, the radar would {{end up being the}} most successful; Taiwan selected it for the Ching-kuo, South Korea also adopted it for the KAI T-50 Golden Eagle trainer aircraft, and the radar was used in the multinational FMA IA 63 Pampa.

5|$|The curve-shortening flow {{has also}} been studied for curves in {{three-dimensional}} Euclidean space. The normal vector in this case can be defined (as in the plane) as the derivative of the tangent vector with respect to arc length, normalized to be a unit vector; {{it is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Frenet–Serret frame. It is not well defined at points of zero curvature, but the product of the curvature and the normal vector remains well defined at those points, allowing the curve-shortening flow to be defined. Curves in space may cross each other or themselves according to this flow, and the flow may lead to singularities in the curves; every singularity is asymptotic to a plane. The curve shortening flow for space curves {{has been used as a}} way to define flow past singularities in plane curves.|$|E
5|$|The first submarine, , {{was laid}} down in February 1990. Collins launch was {{originally}} planned for 1994, but was later set for 28 August 1993. Although launched on schedule, she was not complete: {{the design of the}} submarine had not been finalised, important internal pipes and fittings were not installed, <b>the</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> combat system had yet to be delivered, and some hull sections were actually sheets of timber painted black so the submarine would appear complete in photographs of the launching ceremony. Within weeks of the launch, Collins was removed from the water, and it was not until June 1994 that the submarine was completed. Progress on the other five submarines was delayed by the extra effort required to meet Collins launching date and the subsequent work to complete her. Collins was not commissioned into the RAN until 27 July 1996; eighteen months behind schedule, because of several delays and problems, most relating to the provision and installation of the combat data system software. Collins was not approved for operational deployments until 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood. Most {{studies have focused on}} the mating-type region in fission yeast, which may not be representative of activities in other genomic regions/organisms. In maintenance of existing heterochromatin regions, RITS forms a complex with siRNAs complementary to the local genes and stably binds local methylated histones, acting co-transcriptionally to degrade any nascent pre-mRNA transcripts that are initiated by RNA polymerase. The formation of such a heterochromatin region, though not its maintenance, is dicer-dependent, presumably because dicer is required to generate the initial complement of siRNAs that target subsequent transcripts. Heterochromatin maintenance has been suggested to function as a self-reinforcing feedback loop, as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional nascent transcripts by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes. The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to mammals is not clear, as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of <b>the</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RNAi pathway.|$|E

5|$|Devers was an {{articulate}} {{proponent of}} the Army's now-emerging tactical doctrine of combined arms: infantry-artillery-armor-close air support. He carried a translation of a German manual on <b>the</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> panzer division. Devers was neither the first nor the only general to embrace combined arms as the doctrinal {{solution to the problem}} of how best to employ tanks, but he was well-placed to act upon it. At his direction an updated, comprehensive (460 pages) Armed Force Field Manual: Tactics and Technique FM 17–10 was written, published and distributed in March 1942. A German manual on tank platoon tactics, with a foreword by Heinz Guderian, was translated into English and issued as an Armored Force publication. March 1942 saw a reorganization of the armored divisions in the wake of the 1941 maneuvers. Devers added an artillery headquarters to the armored division, and reorganized the artillery component into three battalions, each of three batteries of six M7 Priest self-propelled guns. A division trains headquarters was added to coordinate logistical activities. In a first, at Devers' insistence, a flight of light aircraft to be used for artillery spotting and reconnaissance were included in the new Table of Organization and Equipment (TO) for each division. He was a strong and early supporter of the development of the DUKW, an amphibious truck. Vannevar Bush later recalled that in the early stages of its development, Devers was the only man in the Army who fully appreciated its possibilities. Its value would be demonstrated during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria (and related structures) {{are found}} in all eukaryotes (except one—the Oxymonad Monocercomonoides sp.). Although {{commonly}} depicted as bean-like structures they form a highly dynamic network {{in the majority of}} cells where they constantly undergo fission and fusion. Mitochondria vary in number and location according to cell type. A single mitochondrion is often found in unicellular organisms. Conversely, numerous mitochondria {{are found in}} human liver cells, with about 1000–2000 mitochondria per cell, making up 1/5 of the cell volume. The population of all the mitochondria of a given cell constitutes the chondriome. The mitochondrial content of otherwise similar cells can vary substantially in size and membrane potential, with differences arising from sources including uneven partitioning at cell divisions, leading to extrinsic differences in ATP levels and downstream cellular processes. The mitochondria can be found nestled between myofibrils of muscle or wrapped around the sperm flagellum. Often, they form a complex 3D branching network inside the cell with the cytoskeleton. The association with the cytoskeleton determines mitochondrial shape, which can affect the function as well: different structures of the mitochondrial network may afford the population a variety of physical, chemical, and signalling advantages or disadvantages. Mitochondria in cells are always distributed along microtubules and the distribution of these organelles is also correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent evidence suggests that vimentin, one of <b>the</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cytoskeleton, is also critical to the association with the cytoskeleton.|$|E
