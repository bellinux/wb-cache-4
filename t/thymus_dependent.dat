Weak or inadequate intrathymic expression of self-antigens increases the risk to generate an autoimmune-prone T cell repertoire. Indeed, even small changes of self-antigen expression in the thymus affect negative selection and increase the predisposition to autoimmunity. Together with other mechanisms, tolerance is maintained in the peripheral lymphoid organs via the recognition by mature T cells of a similar set of self-peptides in homeostatic conditions. However, non-lymphoid peripheral tissue, where organ-specific autoimmunity takes place, often have differential functional processes {{that may lead to}} the generation of epitopes that are absent or non presented in the thymus.

As metalloproteinases (MP) are involved in processes such as growth factor release and ECM modelling, we assessed the effect of MP inhibitors on T-cell development using fetal thymic organ culture systems. MP inhibitors significantly reduced the numbers of CD 4 /CD 8 double-positive (DP) and mature single-positive thymocytes generated, correlated with a reduced number of cell cycles between the double-negative (DN) 3 and DP stages. The progression of early thymocyte progenitors through the DN 1 - 4 stages of development was also severely affected, including incomplete upregulation of CD 25, decreased DN 3 cell numbers, reduced rearrangement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) -β locus and expression of intracellular TCR-β by fewer DN 3 cells. When purified DN 1 cells were utilized as donor cells in reaggregate thymic organ cultures, essentially no DP thymocytes were produced {{in the presence of}} MP inhibitors.

However, as the sensitizing procedure {{is quite different}} from a usual mode of sensitization for DH using complete Freund's adjuvant (FCA), the nature of this reaction has been a matter of controversy. In an attempt to characterize this reaction, we placed special interest on two possibilities regarding the nature of this reaction; Jones-Mote reaction or tuberculin type DH. From the kinetics study on the DH after challenge, the DH reaction to SRBC in mice by intravenous sensitization was clearly distinguished from the Arthus reaction. The dose-response pattern of this reaction also suggested that the contribution of Arthus reactivity to delayed reactivity was negligible. Cell reconstitution experiments revealed this DH to be quantitatively <b>thymus</b> cell <b>dependent.</b> Furthermore, this DH required macrophages at its manifestation stage, and appearance of basophil infiltration at the lesion was absent. In addition, strain difference and ageing of host mice influenced the DH reaction in exactly the same fashion in which these factors influence the tuberculin type-DH induced by subcutaneous sensitization with methylated human serum albumin (MHSA) in FCA.

40|$|Circulation of {{lymphocytes}} through peripheral lymphoid tissues {{as well as}} progenitor {{entry into}} the thymus and its output of mature T cells are critical for normal immune function. Egress of lymphocytes from both peripheral lymphoid organs and <b>thymus</b> is <b>dependent</b> on sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) gradients. S 1 P-lyase 1 (SGPL 1) deficiency leads to accumulation of S 1 P in lymphoid tissues, which blocks lymphocyte egress and induces thymus atrophy. In this study, we investigated thymocyte development in SGPL 1 -deficient mice (SGPL 1 (-/-)), which exhibited postnatal discontinuation of early thymocytopoiesis starting at 2 wk after birth. SGPL(-/-) thymi showed a loss of developing thymocytes in the thymic cortex between 2 and 4 wk of age, whereas mature thymocytes accumulated in the medulla. Detailed analysis demonstrated a deficit in thymic early T cell progenitors (ETP) as the principal reason for discontinued thymocyte development. This developmental block was accompanied by accumulation of ceramides, resulting in enhanced apoptosis of developing T cells. Lack of immigration or settlement of ETP completely halted thymocyte development. We conclude that increased ceramide levels in the thymus of SGPL 1 (-/-) mice abrogate thymic development postnatally by enhanced thymocyte apoptosis and depletion of thymic ETP. Our findings indicate that potentially therapeutic immunosuppression by SGPL 1 inhibition should benefit from monitoring ceramides to prevent their increase to apoptosis- inducing levels. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a normal T cell repertoire in the <b>thymus</b> is <b>dependent</b> on the interplay between signals mediating cell survival (positive selection) and cell death (negative selection or death by neglect). Although the CD 28 costimulatory molecule has been implicated in this process, it {{has been difficult to}} establish a role for the other major costimulatory molecule, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA) - 4. Here we report that in vivo stimulation through the T cell receptor (TCR) –CD 3 complex induces expression of CTLA- 4 in thymocytes and leads to the association of CTLA- 4 with the SH 2 domain–containing phosphatase (SHP) - 2 tyrosine phosphatase. Moreover, intrathymic CTLA- 4 blockade dramatically inhibits anti-CD 3 –mediated depletion of CD 4 � CD 8 � double positive immature thymocytes. Similarly, anti-CD 3 –mediated depletion of CD 4 � CD 8 � double positive cells in fetal thymic organ cultures could also be inhibited by anti–CTLA- 4 antibodies. Thus, our data provide evidence for a role of CTLA- 4 in thymic selection and suggest a novel mechanism contributing to the regulation of TCR-mediated selection of T cell repertoires.

These neuropeptides are also expressed in immune tissues, {{and it has}} been proposed that they may modulate immune responses to stress through paracrine mechanisms. We subjected rats to restraint stress or central injection of interleukin (IL) - 1 beta to determine whether these acute stimuli can alter the expression of neuropeptides in the spleen and thymus. Restraint stress significantly increased the contents of all these neuropeptides in thymic, but not splenic, extracts. A single icv injection of IL- 1 beta increased contents of CRH, AVP, ACTH and beta-endorphin in the spleens of both sham-operated and adrenalectomised (ADX) rats. IL- 1 beta increased thymic contents of CRH and ACTH in sham-operated rats but these increases were not observed in ADX rats. These results suggest that the effects of IL- 1 beta on neuropeptide expression in the spleen are independent of glucocorticoids, whereas IL- 1 beta stimulation of neuropeptide expression in the <b>thymus</b> is <b>dependent</b> on circulating glucocorticoids. There were significant correlations between increases in CRH, ACTH and beta-endorphin in the spleen, and between CRH and ACTH in the thymus, consistent with the suggestion that IL- 1 beta-induced increases in ACTH and beta-endorphin may be mediated through CRH. These results provide evidence that stressors can directly influence neuropeptide expression in immune tissues. Thus stress may influence immune functions through paracrine mechanisms involving locally synthesised neuropeptides as well as through activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis...|$|R

DNA fragmentation was predominantly detected in the thymus of young mice, while it was undetectable in the spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. DNA fragmentation in the <b>thymus</b> was roughly <b>dependent</b> on the dose of lipopolysaccharide injected and reached the peak about 18 h after the injection. The addition of lipopolysaccharide to in vitro cultures of thymocytes did not cause DNA fragmentation, suggesting that lipopolysaccharide was unable to induce apoptosis of thymocytes directly. The injection of lipopolysaccharide induced no significant DNA fragmentation in adrenalectomized mice. The injection of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha antibody together with lipopolysaccharide partially inhibited the appearance of DNA fragmentation in the thymus. On {{the basis of the}} fact that DNA fragmentation is one of the characteristics typical in apoptotic cell death, it was suggested that lipopolysaccharide could induce apoptosis in the mouse thymus in vivo. This apoptosis in the thymus might be mediated mainly by the adrenal hormones, but it is likely that tumor necrosis factor alpha might also participate in it...|$|R

These frequencies in bone marrow were not affected by infection. However, in blood and spleen from thymus-bearing mice at Day 7 post-infection (p. i.), and in the gut at Day 14 p. i., significant increases of mast cell precursor frequencies were detected. In contrast, no significant increase was observed in the tissues of infected nude mice. These data are in accordance with in vivo findings, indicating that a mucosal mast cell response in the gut is both <b>thymus</b> and antigen <b>dependent.</b> It was concluded that a mucosal mast cell response to infection with T. spiralis is probably due to local proliferation and maturation of residing mast cell precursors, that this response might be amplified by an influx of precursor cells from the blood into the gut, and that both phenomena are T-cell dependent...|$|R

The growth of the irradiated thymus was significantly higher in gonadectomized (Gx) than in sham-operated (Sham) mice and the magnitude of thymic growth was apparently age-dependent, as it was greater for newborns than for older mice. Con A response of thymocytes was also significantly higher in Gx mice than in Sham mice, and {{the magnitude of the}} response declined with advancing age of the thymus donors.

In the present study, we investigated generation of NK 1. 1 + TCR-α/β+ cells in the thymus of the aly/aly mouse which lacks lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches and shows abnormalities of thymic and splenic structure. We found that the proportion of the NK 1. 1 + TCR-α/β+ thymocytes was extremely low in these mice as compared with aly/+ and normal C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Thymic reconstitution by BM cells from aly/+ mice that possess a normal population of NK 1. 1 + TCR-α/β+ cell population did not restore the NK 1. 1 + TCR-α/β+ cell population in the thymus of lethally irradiated aly/aly mouse. When deoxyguanosine-treated fetal thymi from (B 6 × B 10.

We have recently found that CD 4 + CD 8 + thymocytes express {{low levels of}} surface TCR because of limitations placed on TCR assembly by the instability of nascent TCR-alpha proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of immature thymocytes. Because TCR-alpha/beta expression increases during development, a molecular mechanism must exist for {{increasing the number of}} assembled TCR complexes present in immature CD 4 + CD 8 + thymocytes that have been signaled to differentiate into mature T cells, although no such mechanism has yet been described. In the current report we have examined the molecular consequences of intracellular signals generated by engagement of surface TCR complexes on immature CD 4 + CD 8 + thymocytes. Isolated TCR engagement generated signals that increased TCR-alpha RNA levels and increased synthesis of TCR-alpha proteins, which, in turn, significantly increased assembly of complete TCR- alpha/beta complexes in CD 4 + CD 8 + thymocytes. Increased TCR-alpha protein levels in TCR-signaled CD 4 + CD 8 + thymocytes was the result of increased synthesis and not increased stability of TCR-alpha proteins, indicating that TCR engagement compensates for, but does not correct, the inherent instability of TCR-alpha proteins in the ER of immature thymocytes. Consistent with the delivery by TCR engagement of a positive selection signal, TCR engagement also increased CD 5 expression, decreased RAG- 1 expression, and decreased CD 4 /CD 8 coreceptor expression in immature CD 4 + CD 8 + thymocytes. These data identify amplified TCR-alpha expression as an initial response of immature CD 4 + CD 8 + thymocytes to TCR-mediated positive selection signals and provide a molecular basis for increased surface TCR density on developing thymocytes undergoing selection events within the thymus...|$|R

The IM primary response was completely normal, but the IgG response was about 1 / 5 - 1 / 3 of normal. The IgM secondary response was normal but the IgG response was minimal. The results indicate that in the CBA/HWehi strain, and in non inbred nude mice IgM production to DNP Fla is a thymus independent process, {{in the sense that}} the magnitude of the response does not depend on T cells. The IgG response to DNP Fla, while present, was reduced, and may thus be partly <b>thymus</b> <b>dependent.</b> The results were interpreted in the light of current knowledge of the mechanism of T/Blymphocyte cooperation, which involves two factors, a specific factor which is a complex of IgT and antigen, which acts indirectly on B cells first binding to macrophages, forming a matrix of antigen, and a non specific factor which acts directly on B cells. It is speculated that the relative lack of IgG in the absence of T cells may be partly due to a deficiency in the non specific factor.

40|$|Interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) is an {{important}} mediator in the vertebrate immune system. IL- 2 is a potent growth factor that mature T lymphocytes use as a proliferation signal {{and the production of}} IL- 2 is crucial for the clonal expansion of antigen-specific T cells in the primary immune response. IL- 2 driven proliferation is dependent on the interaction of the lymphokine with its cognate multichain receptor. IL- 2 expression is induced only upon stimulation and transcriptional activation of the IL- 2 gene relies extensively on the coordinate interaction of numerous inducible and constitutive trans-acting factors. Over the past several years, thousands of papers have been published regarding molecular and cellular aspects of IL- 2 gene expression and IL- 2 function. The vast majority of these reports describe work that has been carried out in vitro. However, considerably less is known about control of IL- 2 gene expression and IL- 2 function in vivo. To gain new insight into the regulation of IL- 2 gene expression in vivo, anatomical and developmental patterns of IL- 2 gene expression in the mouse were established by employing in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining methodologies to tissue sections generated from normal mice and mutant animals in which T -cell development was perturbed. Results from these studies revealed several interesting aspects of IL- 2 gene expression, such as (1) induction of IL- 2 gene expression and protein synthesis in the thymus, the primary site of T-cell development in the body, (2) cell-type specificity of IL- 2 gene expression in vivo, (3) participation of IL- 2 in the extrathymic expansion of mature T cells in particular tissues, independent of an acute immune response to foreign antigen, (4) involvement of IL- 2 in maintaining immunologic balance in the mucosal immune system, and (5) potential function of IL- 2 in early events associated with hematopoiesis. Extensive analysis of IL- 2 mRNA accumulation and protein production in the murine thymus at various stages of development established the existence of two classes of intrathymic IL- 2 producing cells. One class of intrathymic IL- 2 producers was found exclusively in the fetal thymus. Cells belonging to this subset were restricted to the outermost region of the thymus. IL- 2 expression in the fetal thymus was highly transient; a dramatic peak ofiL- 2 mRNA accumulation was identified at day 14. 5 of gestation and maximal IL- 2 protein production was observed 12 hours later, after which both IL- 2 mRNA and protein levels rapidly decreased. Significantly, the presence of IL- 2 expressing cells in the day 14 - 15 fetal thymus was not contingent on the generation of T-cell receptor (TcR) positive cells. The second class of IL- 2 producing cells was also detectable in the fetal thymus (cells found in this class represented a minority subset of IL- 2 producers in the fetal thymus) but persist in the thymus during later stages of development and after birth. Intrathymic IL- 2 producers in postnatal animals were located in the subcapsular region and cortex, indicating that these cells reside in the same areas where immature T cells are consigned. The frequency of IL- 2 expressing cells in the postnatal thymus was extremely low, indicating that induction of IL- 2 expression and protein synthesis are indicative of a rare activation event. Unlike the fetal class of intrathymic IL- 2 producers, the presence of IL- 2 producing cells in the postnatal <b>thymus</b> was <b>dependent</b> on to the generation of TcR+ cells. Subsequent examination of intrathymic IL- 2 production in mutant postnatal mice unable to produce either αβ or γδ T cells showed that postnatal IL- 2 producers in the thymus belong to both αβ and γδ lineages. Additionally, further studies indicated that IL- 2 synthesis by immature αβ -T cells depends on the expression of bonafide TcR αβ-heterodimers. Taken altogether, IL- 2 production in the postnatal thymus relies on the generation of αβ or γδ-TcR^+ cells and induction of IL- 2 protein synthesis can be linked to an activation event mediated via the TcR. With regard to tissue specificity of IL- 2 gene expression in vivo, analysis of whole body sections obtained from normal neonatal mouse pups by in situ hybridization demonstrated that IL- 2 mRNA^+ cells were found in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues with which T cells are associated, such as the thymus (as described above), dermis and gut. Tissues devoid of IL- 2 mRNA^+ cells included brain, heart, lung, liver, stomach, spine, spinal cord, kidney, and bladder. Additional analysis of isolated tissues taken from older animals revealed that IL- 2 expression was undetectable in bone marrow and in nonactivated spleen and lymph nodes. Thus, it appears that extrathymic IL- 2 expressing cells in nonimmunologically challenged animals are relegated to particular epidermal and epithelial tissues in which characterized subsets of T cells reside and thatinduction of IL- 2 gene expression associated with these tissues may be a result of T-cell activation therein. Based on the neonatal in situ hybridization results, a detailed investigation into possible induction of IL- 2 expression resulting in IL- 2 protein synthesis in the skin and gut revealed that IL- 2 expression is induced in the epidermis and intestine and IL- 2 protein is available to drive cell proliferation of resident cells and/or participate in immune function in these tissues. Pertaining to IL- 2 expression in the skin, maximal IL- 2 mRNA accumulation and protein production were observed when resident Vγ_ 3 ^+ T-cell populations were expanding. At this age, both IL- 2 mRNA^+ cells and IL- 2 protein production were intimately associated with hair follicles. Likewise, at this age a significant number of CD 3 ε^+ cells were also found in association with follicles. The colocalization of IL- 2 expression and CD 3 ε^+ cells suggests that IL- 2 expression is induced when T cells are in contact with hair follicles. In contrast, neither IL- 2 mRNA nor IL- 2 protein were readily detected once T-cell density in the skin reached steady-state proportions. At this point, T cells were no longer found associated with hair follicles but were evenly distributed throughout the epidermis. In addition, IL- 2 expression in the skin was contingent upon the presence of mature T cells therein and induction of IL- 2 protein synthesis in the skin did not depend on the expression of a specific TcR on resident T cells. These newly disclosed properties of IL- 2 expression in the skin indicate that IL- 2 may play an additional role in controlling mature T-cell proliferation by participating in the extrathymic expansion of T cells, particularly those associated with the epidermis. Finally, regarding IL- 2 expression and protein synthesis in the gut, IL- 2 producing cells were found associated with the lamina propria of neonatal animals and gut-associated IL- 2 production persisted throughout life. In older animals, the frequency of IL- 2 producing cells in the small intestine was not identical to that in the large intestine and this difference may reflect regional specialization of the mucosal immune system in response to enteric antigen. Similar to other instances of IL- 2 gene expression in vivo, a failure to generate mature T cells also led to an abrogation of IL- 2 protein production in the gut. The presence of IL- 2 producing cells in the neonatal gut suggested that these cells may be generated during fetal development. Examination of the fetal gut to determine the distribution of IL- 2 producing cells therein indicated that there was a tenfold {{increase in the number of}} gut-associated IL- 2 producers at day 20 of gestation compared to that observed four days earlier and there was little difference between the frequency of IL- 2 producing cells in prenatal versus neonatal gut. The origin of these fetally-derived IL- 2 producing cells is unclear. Prior to the immigration of IL- 2 inducible cells to the fetal gut and/or induction of IL- 2 expression therein, IL- 2 protein was observed in the fetal liver and fetal omentum, as well as the fetal thymus. Considering that induction of IL- 2 protein synthesis may be an indication of future functional capability, detection of IL- 2 producing cells in the fetal liver and fetal omentum raises the possibility that IL- 2 producing cells in the fetal gut may be extrathymic in origin and IL- 2 producing cells in these fetal tissues may not belong solely to the T lineage. Overall, these results provide increased understanding of the nature of IL- 2 producing cells in the gut and how the absence of IL- 2 production therein and in fetal hematopoietic tissues can result in the acute pathology observed in IL- 2 deficient animals. ...|$|R
