5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{has been}} {{recorded}} growing on the fallen wood of oaks of the subgenus Cyclobalanopsis, {{as well as the}} wood of other flowering plants. The species favours <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> trees, where it feeds as a saprotroph, causing white rot. P.ellipsoideus fruit bodies are perennial growers, allowing them to, in the correct circumstances, grow very large. The species is found in the tropical and subtropical areas of China; it {{has been recorded}} in Fujian Province and Hainan Province. It is not a common species, and fruit bodies are only occasionally encountered.|$|E
5|$|The island's {{proximity}} {{to the river and}} the ocean suggests that the area is suited to fishing and related activities, yet the indigenous people, mostly land-dwellers, have long been content to practise artisan fishing, just to supply their own daily needs. Pirogues cut from <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> kapok trees are most often used, along with traps, nets, baskets, and fences. In the early 20th century, experienced fishermen from other parts of Senegal, along with others from Mali, Guinea, and Ghana, developed deep-sea fishing on the island and introduced new equipment.|$|E
5000|$|While {{cruising}} around, McDuff noticed Sullivan {{and parked}} around 150 {{yards away from}} the soon-to-be victims. He threatened the trio with his [...]38 Colt revolver and ordered them to get into <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> their car. With Green following in McDuff's car, McDuff drove the victims' Ford along a highway and then into a field, where he ordered Sullivan out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ford and instructed Green to put her into <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> his Dodge Coronet. At this point, according to Green's statement, McDuff {{said he would have}} to [...] "knock 'em off"; he proceeded to fire six shots into <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ford in spite of Dunman's and Brand's pleas not to. McDuff then instructed Green to wipe the fingerprints off the Ford.|$|R

5|$|In 2001, Han was the {{founding}} President of the Sculpture Society (Singapore), and remains its Honorary President.

The project, sponsored by the Asia Pacific Breweries Foundation Inspire Programme, was intended to provide sculptors and installation artists with studio space and a chance to interact with the public in a park environment.

Her sculptures can be found around the world, in Osaka and Shōdoshima, Kagawa Prefecture, in Japan; Kuala Lumpur and Sarawak in Malaysia; and Washington, D.C. In Singapore, sculptures commissioned from her can be seen at Capital Tower, the Defence Science Organisation National Laboratories, the Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay, the National Museum of Singapore, Revenue House, Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 3, Suntec City Mall, and Woodlands Regional Library.

5|$|In {{temperate}} climates {{there is}} a sudden movement of sap {{at the end of}} the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is harvested by drilling holes in <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> the trees and collecting the liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. One litre of maple syrup is obtained from every forty litres of sap and has a sugar content of exactly 66%. Similarly in northern Europe the spring rise in the sap of the silver birch (Betula pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (Betula lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one litre of birch syrup.|$|E

5|$|M.regularis is {{a highly}} {{aggressive}} ant that will pursue any intruder to a distance of 1.8–2.7 metres (2–3 yards) if their nests are disturbed. Their stings are very painful and particularly powerful. In some cases, human victims of M.regularis bites have displayed an allergy to the venom. In a 2011 study which investigated the causes of ant sting anaphylaxis in Australia, 265 of the 376 human participants reacted to the sting of several Myrmecia species. Of these, nine serum samples taken from patients were IgE positive to the venom of M.regularis. These ants are both diurnal and nocturnal, foraging on <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> Eucalyptus trees to feed on sap and nectar, or capturing small insects (such as caterpillars and ants in the genus Camponotus or subgenus Orthocrema). The larvae are carnivorous and exclusively feed on insects, either consuming small portions of the insect or all of it. Unlike most Myrmecia species, trophallaxis takes place among adults or between adults and larvae. All stages of the frog Metacrinia nichollsi are known to dwell inside M.regularis colonies, where they use several galleries constructed by the ants. The parasitic ant M.inquilina may attempt to enter M.regularis nests to establish colonies, but M.inquilina queens may be seized and killed {{as soon as the}} two species come into contact.|$|E

25|$|Calymperastrum latifolium is {{the sole}} species in the {{monotypic}} moss genus Calymperastrum. It is a poorly known moss, having been collected only three times.

25|$|Another early {{technique}} involved {{complete removal}} of brush and woody vegetation from an area. Tsetse tend {{to rest on}} <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> trees so removing woody vegetation made the area inhospitable to the flies. However, the technique was not widely used and has been abandoned. Preventing regrowth of woody vegetation requires continuous clearing efforts, which is only practical where large human populations are present. The clearing of woody vegetation {{has come to be}} seen as an environmental problem more than a benefit.|$|E
25|$|The {{people of}} Basankusu usually keep {{vegetable}} gardens {{away from the}} town itself. They are cut into the forest and fit the slash and burn model of farming. These plots of land are often only partially cleared, with house-sized termite hills and <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> felled trees left to supply firewood for the year's cooking. Cassava is the main crop. It can be grown for the table {{as well as for}} the market-place. Peanuts, maize, papaya, pineapples, avocados, oil palms, and other fruits and vegetables are also grown.|$|E

25|$|The photos, {{taken with}} a cheap Instamatic camera, show {{what appears to be}} a male ivory-billed {{woodpecker}} perched on <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> two trees in the Atchafalaya Basin of Louisiana. The bird's distinctive bill is not visible in either photo and the photos– taken from a distance– are very grainy. Lowery presented the photos at the 1971 annual meeting of the American Ornithologists Union. Skeptics dismissed the photos as frauds; seeing that the bird is in roughly the same position in both photos, they suggested they may have been of a mounted specimen.|$|E
25|$|The tomb bat prefers {{sites where}} there is {{overhead}} shelter, but are situated in exposed positions for easier take off.

25|$|There are {{thousands}} of species whose stems have economic uses. Stems provide a few major staple crops such as potato and taro. Sugarcane stems are {{a major source of}} sugar.
