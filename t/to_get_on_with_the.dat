2500|$|After {{the council}} leader Nicholas Paget-Brown was interviewed on BBC's Newsnight, he was criticised for his remark that [...] "many {{residents}} {{felt that we}} needed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> installation of new hot water systems, new boilers and that trying to retrofit more would delay the building and that sprinklers aren't the answer." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the race, Ruby Walsh said: [...] "I {{was fairly}} adamant that the run at Cheltenham would improve him jumping-wise and {{that proved to}} be as he jumped like a buck today. I think Willie is keen to go jumping fences with him but he's in the mix now [...] - it will have Willie {{scratching}} his head". Willie Mullins confirmed later that day: [...] "he´ll stay hurdling next season. He´s a keen horse and likes <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> job so he could well stay at this trip." [...] earning him Paddy Power quotes of 5/1 co-favourite with The New One and stablemate Vautour for the 2015 Champion Hurdle.|$|E

The paganism was never a problem; I was always left <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lyrics the best way I saw fit. No, the truth was that I could see that the music was going to get even more complex. Andy was writing 11 minute musical epics and I couldn't even begin to see how I'd write lyrics for something like that. I wanted to bring in other musical styles, to bring in violins for instance. That would never have worked with Sabbat." ...|$|E

2500|$|Propelled by {{a string}} of hit singles, Tango in the Night became the band's biggest album since Rumours a decade earlier. However, {{following}} its release, Buckingham left Fleetwood Mac largely because of his desire not to tour and the strain he was feeling within the band. [...] "I needed to get some separation from Stevie especially, because I don't think I'd ever quite gotten closure on our relationship," [...] he said. [...] "I needed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> next phase of my creative growth and my emotional growth. When you break up with someone and then for the next 10 years {{you have to be}} around them and do for them and watch them move away from you, it's not easy." [...] Fleetwood Mac continued without him, and Buckingham was replaced by guitarists Rick Vito and Billy Burnette.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, another rumour {{followed}} {{when the}} new Governor MacLehose, who brought many new policies to Hong Kong, {{was said to be}} 'diplomatic' in style and did not get on well with some of his colleagues. Some of the more old-fashioned colonial officials, such as (later Sir) Donald Luddington were alleged to have found it difficult <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new Governor and were soon posted out of Hong Kong. Norman-Walker was one of these [...] "old-fashioned colonial officials" [...] and news emerged in the beginning of 1972 {{that he was going to}} retire from the government at the turn of 1973. This was not confirmed until July 1972 when the UK government announced that the term of Norman-Walker as Colonial Secretary would be extended to the autumn of 1973. In May 1973, it was further announced that Norman-Walker would become the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{not until}} the fourth Test of the series against India in 1962 that Nurse was given another {{opportunity}} at Test level. Nurse was made only one run in the first innings and in the secon innings was 46 not {{out at the end of}} the matchthe West Indies won by 7 wickets. Nurse's next opportunity was with the West Indies team to England in 1963 but again he was affected by an injury that kept him lame for the greater part of the tour. He did not play a Test match but there was some qualified praise for his efforts in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack: [...] "Nurse took a long time to justify the nice things claimed for him. He got himself out far too often through always being in too big a hurry <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> scoring, but in August he looked a very fine player." [...] He was given another opportunity to succeed in the sub-continent with a Commonwealth XI tour of Pakistan in 1963. Nurse scored 369 runs in six matches on tour including 126 not out in the final match against Pakistan at Dacca Stadium.|$|E

2500|$|Ningirsu {{responds}} {{that his}} governor {{will build a}} temple dedicated to great accomplishments. Gudea is then sent a dream where a giant man – with wings, a crown, and two lions – commanded him to build the E-ninnu temple. Two figures then appear: a woman holding a gold stylus, and a hero holding a lapis lazuli tablet on which he drew the plan of a house. The hero placed bricks in a brick mold and carrying basket, in front of Gudea – while a donkey gestured impatiently with its hoof. After waking, Gudea could not understand the dream so traveled to visit the goddess Nanse by canal for interpretation of the oracle. Gudea stops at several shrines on the route to make offerings to various other deities. Nanse explains that the giant man is her brother Ningirsu, and {{the woman with the}} golden stylus is Nisaba goddess of writing, directing him to lay out the temple astronomically aligned with the [...] "holy stars". The hero is Nindub an architect-god surveying the plan of the temple. The donkey was supposed to represent Gudea himself, eager <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> building work.|$|E
2500|$|Author Hilary Kingsley has {{described}} Pete as [...] "rough and ready [...] Rough {{with his tongue}} and his fists, and ready to jump to jump into an argument whether he knows anything about it or not. Act first, think later, if at all, is Pete's attitude." [...] She inferred that he was unintelligent suggesting {{that he would not}} get into Mensa and that he seems [...] "thick as a brick". It has been suggested by writer Dorothy Hobson that the character of Pete was a portrayal of a typical East End male, [...] "macho and mouthy". Author Christine Geraghty has suggested that Pete was seemingly intolerant of difference, but that his position was always undermined [...] "by his blustering espousal of an excessively masculine position. Pete's , like much else he does, are not followed through." [...] Discussing the character's other qualities, author Kate Lock has suggested that Pete was [...] "a simple, amiable sort of chap [...] left others <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> complicated things in life." [...] Lock added that complications were beyond Pete's grasp and that he had trouble articulating emotions. Meanwhile, author Rupert Smith has classified Pete as a [...] "soft touch" [...] character. He added that Pete started off as [...] "a cheery chappy" [...] but became [...] "hard to like", using his failure to support his wife Kathy through her rape ordeal in 1988 as a reason why he lost public sympathy.|$|E

60|$|There {{were times}} when I could have wished the world a world all of men, so greatly did this unassimilated series of motives and curiosities hamper me; and times when I could have wished the world all of women. I seemed always to be seeking {{something}} in women, in girls, and I was never clear what it was I was seeking. But never--even at my coarsest--was I moved by physical desire alone. Was I seeking help and fellowship? Was I seeking some intimacy with beauty? It was a thing too formless to state, that I seemed always desiring to attain and never attaining. Waves of gross sensuousness arose out of this preoccupation, carried me to a crisis of gratification or disappointment that was clearly not the needed thing; they passed and left my mind free again for a time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> permanent pursuits of my life. And then presently this solicitude would have me again, an irrelevance as it seemed, and yet a constantly recurring demand.|$|E
6000|$|Opening a letter, {{though it}} had been folded by the {{delicate}} hands of Ursula Malbone, and reading it, were two very different operations, as Zephaniah now discovered. The education of the young man was very limited, and after an effort or two, he found it impossible <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> letter open in his hand, he found it as much a sealed book to him as ever. Zephaniah could read writing, by dint of a considerable deal of spelling; but it must not be a good hand. As some persons cannot comprehend pure English, so he found far more difficulty in spelling out the pretty, even characters before him, than would have been the case had he been set at work on the pot-hooks and trammels of one of his own sisters. Glancing his eyes around in quest of aid, they happened to fall on mine, which were watching his movements with the vigilance of a feline animal, through the chinks of the logs, and at the distance of only three feet from his own face. As for the Indian, he, seemingly, took no more note of what was passing, than lovers take of time in a stolen interview; though I had subsequently reason to believe that nothing had escaped his observation. Andries was in a distant part of the prison, reconnoitring the clearing and mills with an interest that absorbed all his attention for the moment. Of these facts Zephaniah assured himself by taking a look through the openings of the logs; then, sidling along nearer to me, he said in a low voice-- ...|$|E

There was nothing but that wretched, old, mangled {{steamboat}} I was leaning against, while he talked fluently about 'the necessity for every man to get on.' 'And when one comes out here, you conceive, {{it is not to}} gaze at the moon.' Mr. Kurtz was a 'universal genius,' but even a genius would find it easier to work with 'adequate tools--intelligent men.' He did not make bricks--why, there was a physical impossibility in the way--as I was well aware; and if he did secretarial work for the manager, it was because 'no sensible man rejects wantonly the confidence of his superiors.' Did I see it? I saw it. What more did I want? What I really wanted was rivets, by heaven! Rivets. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> work--to stop the hole. Rivets I wanted. There were cases of them down at the coast--cases--piled up--burst--split! You kicked a loose rivet at every second step in that station yard on the hillside. Rivets had rolled into the grove of death. You could fill your pockets with rivets for the trouble of stooping down--and there wasn't one rivet to be found where it was wanted. We had plates that would do, but nothing to fasten them with. And every week the messenger, a lone negro, letter-bag on shoulder and staff in hand, left our station for the coast. And several times a week a coast caravan came in with trade goods,--ghastly glazed calico that made you shudder only to look at it, glass beads value about a penny a quart, confounded spotted cotton handkerchiefs. And no rivets. Three carriers could have brought all that was wanted to set that steamboat afloat.|$|E
