25|$|Boas {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} opponents of the then popular ideologies of scientific racism, the idea <b>that</b> <b>race</b> <b>is</b> a biological concept and that human behavior is best understood through the typology of biological characteristics. In a series of groundbreaking studies of skeletal anatomy he showed that cranial shape and size was highly malleable depending on environmental factors such as health and nutrition, in contrast to the claims by racial anthropologists of the day that held head shape to be a stable racial trait. Boas also worked to demonstrate that differences in human behavior are not primarily determined by innate biological dispositions, but are largely the result of cultural differences acquired through social learning. In this way, Boas introduced culture as the primary concept for describing differences in behavior between human groups, and as the central analytical concept of anthropology.|$|E
25|$|American {{public school}} systems, {{especially}} in large metropolitan areas, {{to a large}} extent are still de facto segregated. Whether due to Brown, or due to Congressional action, or due to societal change, the percentage of black students attending majority-black school districts decreased somewhat until the early 1980s, at which point that percentage began to increase. By the late 1990s, the percentage of black students in mostly minority school districts had returned to about what it was in the late 1960s. In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 (2007), the Court held that, if a school system became racially imbalanced due to social factors other than governmental racism, then the state is not as free to integrate schools as if the state had been at fault for the racial imbalance. This is especially evident in the charter school system where parents of students can pick which schools their children attend based on the amenities provided by that school and the needs of the child. It seems <b>that</b> <b>race</b> <b>is</b> a factor in the choice of charter school.|$|E
500|$|The {{question}} of race represents {{a major source}} of division among Heathens, particularly in the United States. Within the Heathen community, one viewpoint holds <b>that</b> <b>race</b> <b>is</b> entirely a matter of biological heredity, while the opposing position is <b>that</b> <b>race</b> <b>is</b> a social construct rooted in cultural heritage. In U.S. Heathen discourse, these viewpoints are described as the folkish and the universalist positions, respectively. These two factions—which Kaplan termed the [...] "racialist" [...] and [...] "nonracialist" [...] camps—often clash, with Kaplan claiming that a [...] "virtual civil war" [...] existed between them within the American Heathen community. The universalist and folkish division has also spread to other countries; in contrast to North America and much of Northern Europe, discussions of race rarely arise among the Icelandic Heathen community {{as a result of the}} nation-state's predominantly ethnically homogeneous composition.|$|E

2500|$|Racism is abusive attitudes or {{treatment}} of others {{based on the}} belief <b>that</b> <b>race</b> <b>is</b> a primary determinant of human traits and capacities. It is a form of pride that one's own race is superior and, as a result, has a right to [...] "rule or dominate others," [...] according to a Macquarie Dictionary definition. Racism is correlated with and can foster race-based prejudice, violence, dislike, discrimination, and oppression.|$|E
2500|$|Many Canadians {{believe that}} the {{relationship}} between the English and French languages is the central or defining aspect of the Canadian experience. Canada's Official Languages Commissioner (the federal government official charged with monitoring the two languages) has stated, [...] "n the same way <b>that</b> <b>race</b> <b>is</b> at the core {{of what it means to}} be American and at the core of an American experience and class is at the core of British experience, I think that language is at the core of Canadian experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Latin American {{concepts}} of race, [...] physiological traits is often combined with social traits such as socio-economic status, {{so that a}} person is categorized not only according to physical phenotype, but also according to social standing. [...] Ethnicity on the other hand is a system that classifies groups of people according to cultural, linguistic and historic criteria. An ethnic group is normally defined by having a degree of cultural and linguistic similarity and often an ideology of shared roots. Another difference between race and ethnicity is <b>that</b> <b>race</b> <b>is</b> [...] usually conceptualized as a system of categorization where membership is limited to one category, and is externally ascribed by other who are not members of that category without regards to the individuals own feeling of membership. Whereas Ethnicity is often seen as a system of social organization where membership is established through mutual identification between a group and its members.|$|E

2500|$|Farming, {{rather than}} just reduced sunlight, may have helped trigger pale skin in Europeans. In a 2007 study, almost all Africans and East Asians have one allele of the SLC24A5 gene, whereas 98% of the Europeans studied had the other. [...] These data suggest that a {{selective}} sweep occurred as recently as 5,300 to 6,000 years ago, replacing darker skins with light skins at astonishing speed. It implies that Europeans had been dark-skinned {{for tens of thousands}} of years. Several decades ago, Stanford's Cavalli-Sforza had argued that European hunter-gatherers, herders and fishers could have survived from the vitamin D content of their diet alone. Only when farming took hold did Europeans—replacing meat and fish with grain—need to absorb more sunlight to produce vitamin D in their skin. Other writers, including Darwin, Miller, and Dawkins, have proposed that skin-colour changes were driven by sexual selection. Cochran and Harpending reject the sexual-selection idea when used to imply <b>that</b> <b>race</b> <b>is</b> no more than skin deep ("perhaps little more than a fad"), pointing out that experts can easily determine race from skeletal evidence alone.|$|E
2500|$|... {{described}} {{the situation as}} [...] "admirable" [...] {{during a visit to}} the Philippines in the 1870s.The lines separating entire classes and races, appeared to me less marked than in the Oriental colonies. I have seen on the same table, Spaniards, Mestizos (Chinos cristianos) and Indios, priests and military. There is no doubt that having one Religion forms great bonding. And more so to the eyes of one that has been observing the repulsion and differences due to race in many parts of Asia. And from one (like myself) who knows <b>that</b> <b>race</b> <b>is</b> the great divider of society, the admirable contrast and exception to racial discrimination so markedly presented by the people of the Philippines is indeed admirable.Another foreign witness was English engineer, Frederic H. Sawyer, who had {{spent most of his life}} in different parts of Asia and lived in Luzon for fourteen years. His impression was that as far as racial integration and harmony was concerned, the situation in the Philippines was not equaled by any other colonial power:"...

60|$|Neither in {{the world}} of {{politics}} nor that of literature, then, has the rejection of general theories proved a success. It may be that there have been many moonstruck and misleading ideals that have from time to time perplexed mankind. But assuredly there has been no ideal in practice so moonstruck and misleading as the ideal of practicality. Nothing has lost so many opportunities as the opportunism of Lord Rosebery. He is, indeed, a standing symbol of this epoch--the man who is theoretically a practical man, and practically more unpractical than any theorist. Nothing in this universe is so unwise as that kind of worship of worldly wisdom. A man who is perpetually thinking of whether this race or <b>that</b> <b>race</b> <b>is</b> strong, of whether this cause or that cause is promising, is the man who will never believe in anything long enough to make it succeed. The opportunist politician is like a man who should abandon billiards because he was beaten at billiards, and abandon golf because he was beaten at golf. There is nothing which is so weak for working purposes as this enormous importance attached to immediate victory. There is nothing that fails like success.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} side, I found a vast body of {{testimony}} that savages had no religion at all. But that testimony, en masse, was refuted by Roskoff, and also, in places, by Tylor. When three witnesses {{were brought to}} swear that they saw the Irishman commit a crime, he offered to bring a dozen witnesses who did NOT see him. Negative evidence of squatters, sailors and colonists, who did NOT see any religion among this or <b>that</b> <b>race,</b> <b>is</b> not worth much against evidence of trained observers and linguists who DID find what the others missed, and who found more the more they knew the tribe in question. Again, like others, I thought savages incapable of such relatively pure ideas as I now believe {{some of them to}} possess. But I could not resist the evidence, and I abandoned my a priori notions. The evidence forcibly attests gradations in the central belief. It is found in various shades, from relative potency down to a vanishing trace, and it is found in significant proportion to the prevalence of animistic ideas, being weakest where they are most developed, strongest where they are least developed. There must be a reason for these phenomena, and that reason, as it seems to me, is the overlaying and supersession of a rudely Theistic by an animistic creed. That one cause would explain, and does colligate, all the facts.|$|E
