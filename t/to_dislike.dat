5|$|As Sayid and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{discuss the}} attack on Sayid, Locke {{suggests}} that Sawyer is the culprit, since he is doing well for himself on the island, hoarding other people's possessions, and also seems <b>to</b> <b>dislike</b> Sayid. Meanwhile, Shannon begins to have trouble breathing due to her lack of medication and panic resulting from this problem. Jack tries beating answers out of Sawyer by punching him, but stops when he sees others' disapproval. Then with Jack's approval, Sayid ties Sawyer to a tree and tortures him for answers, revealing that he has tortured people before.|$|E
5|$|Because {{remarriage}} {{was often}} {{thought to be}} a sacrilege—common belief (contrary to the Gospel – Luke 20:27–40 and Matthew 22:29–30) was that the sacrament of marriage extended beyond death—it was censured by the community. Thus the purpose of the Bal des Ardents was twofold: to entertain the court and to humiliate and rebuke Isabeau's lady-in-waiting—in an inherently pagan manner, which the Monk of St Denis seemed <b>to</b> <b>dislike.</b> A ritual burning on the wedding night of a woman who was remarrying had Christian origins as well, according to Veenstra. The Book of Tobit partly concerns a woman who had seven husbands murdered by the demon Asmodeus; she is eventually freed of the demon by the burning of the heart and liver of a fish.|$|E
5|$|Clark Green (Clark Duke) hits on Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) by {{dangling}} a fake newscaster job. After receiving some not-so-helpful {{advice from}} her coworkers—especially Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Darryl, {{who is now}} assistant regional manager—Clark invites Erin to his apartment for the fake audition. However, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), who has come <b>to</b> <b>dislike</b> Clark, invites himself and Andy along under the pretense of helping with the audition, ruining Clark's seduction plan. Andy ends up throwing himself into the fake plan and more or less dismissing Erin, who in turns goes out for dinner with Pete {{and appears to be}} enjoying time spent with him.|$|E

5|$|The Red Hot Chili Peppers had {{released}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik in 1991. The {{album was}} an instant hit, selling over seven million copies in the United States, and turned the band into an international sensation. Guitarist John Frusciante was having difficulty coping with the band's newfound fame and started <b>to</b> <b>dislike</b> it. Frusciante often argued with his bandmates, and sabotaged performances. He began taking heroin and steadily increased his usage of the drug over time. Frusciante quit the band in 1992, during its Japanese leg of the tour. He returned {{to his home in}} California and became a recluse.|$|E
5|$|The story, {{expanded}} {{from that of}} the concept album, centers on three disaffected young men, Johnny, Will and Tunny. Johnny and Tunny flee a stifling suburban lifestyle and parental restrictions, while Will stays home to work out his relationship with his pregnant girlfriend, Heather. The former pair look for meaning in life and try out the freedom and excitement of the city. Tunny quickly gives up on life in the city, joins the military and is shipped off to war. Johnny turns to drugs and finds a part of himself that he grows <b>to</b> <b>dislike,</b> has a relationship and experiences lost love.|$|E
5|$|On January 10, 1935, the {{building}} shifted to within 2.5 {{feet from the}} edge of the cliff following a landslide caused by a severe storm. The warden at the time, James A. Johnston, proposed extend the seawall next to it and asked the Bureau for $6500 to fund it; he would later claim <b>to</b> <b>dislike</b> {{the building}} because it was irregularly shaped. A smaller, cheaper riprap was completed by the end of 1935. A guard tower and a catwalk from Hill Tower was added to the roof of the Industries Building in June 1936 and the building was made secure with bars from old cells to bar the windows and grill the roof ventilators and to prevent inmates from escaping from the roof. It ceased use as a laundry in 1939 when it was moved to the upper floor of the New Industries Building. Today the building is heavily rusted after decades of exposure to the salt air and wind, and neither the guard tower on top of the building nor the Hill Tower still exist.|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "How You Remind Me" [...] {{featured}} Nickelback playing a small venue with {{focus on a}} female audience member. Chad Kroeger admitted <b>to</b> <b>disliking</b> {{the idea of a}} small venue performance at first, opting for a bigger scale arena concert; however, he found the outcome of the video satisfying.|$|R
40|$|Stone and Valentine (2004) {{presented}} masked 17 ms {{faces in}} simultaneous pairs of one famous and one unfamiliar face. Accuracy in selecting the famous face was higher when the famous person {{was regarded as}} ‘‘good’’ or liked than when regarded as ‘‘evil’’ or disliked. Experiment 1 attempted to replicate this phenomenon, but produced a different pattern of results. Experiment 2 investigated alternative explanations and found evidence supporting only the effect of response latency: responses made soon after stimulus onset were more accurate to liked than <b>to</b> <b>disliked</b> faces, whereas responses made after a longer delay were equally accurate <b>to</b> <b>disliked</b> faces. It appears {{that the effect of}} negative valence was corrected within the space of a few hundred milliseconds. Experiment 3, using an affective priming paradigm, supported the concept that an early-arising effect of valence is corrected if it is misleading to the directed task...|$|R

25|$|As a young man, Russell had {{a decidedly}} {{religious}} bent, himself, {{as is evident}} in his early Platonism. He longed for eternal truths, as he makes clear in his famous essay, , widely regarded as a masterpiece of prose, but a work that Russell came <b>to</b> <b>dislike.</b> While he rejected the supernatural, he freely admitted that he yearned for a deeper meaning to life.|$|E
25|$|Stock issues: In {{order for}} the affirmative team to win, their plan must retain all of the stock issues, which are Harms, Inherency, Solvency, Topicality, and Significance. For the {{negative}} to win, they only need {{to prove that the}} affirmative fails to meet one of the stock issues. These judges are more likely <b>to</b> <b>dislike</b> newer arguments such as kritiks and some theoretical points.|$|E

25|$|Another tactic Roosevelt {{admitted}} to using was bribing demonstrators into attacking {{symbols of the}} Shah, while chanting pro-Mossadegh slogans. As king, the Shah was largely seen {{as a symbol of}} Iran at the time by many Iranians and monarchists. Roosevelt declared that the more that these agents showed their hate for the Shah and attacked his symbols, the more it caused the average Iranian citizen <b>to</b> <b>dislike</b> and distrust Mossadegh.|$|E
25|$|When Gale left Aldenham {{he wanted}} to become a British Army officer in the Royal Artillery, but did not possess the {{academic}} qualifications or physical grades required for entry into the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Instead Gale followed in his father's footsteps and gained employment as an insurance agent, but he rapidly grew <b>to</b> <b>dislike</b> the job; determined to enter the British Army, he attended regular physical training classes and studied hard to improve his academic grades.|$|E
25|$|It has {{sometimes}} been inferred that Shakespeare came <b>to</b> <b>dislike</b> his wife, {{but there is no}} existing documentation or correspondence to support this supposition. For most of their married life, he lived in London, writing and performing his plays, while she remained in Stratford. However, according to John Aubrey, he returned to Stratford for a period every year. When he retired from the theatre in 1613, he chose to live in Stratford with his wife, rather than in London.|$|E

25|$|Later that year, Sade was tricked {{into going}} to Paris {{to visit his}} {{supposedly}} ill mother, who in fact had recently died. He was arrested there and imprisoned in the Château de Vincennes. He successfully appealed his death sentence in 1778, but remained imprisoned under the lettre de cachet. He escaped but was soon recaptured. He resumed writing and met fellow prisoner Comte de Mirabeau, who also wrote erotic works. Despite this common interest, the two came <b>to</b> <b>dislike</b> each other intensely.|$|E
25|$|Some legends {{state that}} Virgil, fearing {{that he would}} die before he had {{properly}} revised the poem, gave instructions to friends (including the current emperor, Augustus) that the Aeneid should be burned upon his death, owing to its unfinished state and because he had come <b>to</b> <b>dislike</b> one of the sequences in Book VIII, in which Venus and Vulcan have sexual intercourse, for its nonconformity to Roman moral virtues. The friends did not comply with Virgil's wishes and Augustus himself ordered that they be disregarded. After minor modifications, the Aeneid was published.|$|E
50|$|However, due <b>to</b> their <b>dislike</b> <b>to</b> being {{observed}} by the increasingly pervasive Christians, they have latterly constructed a prayer-hall at Chelga.

50|$|Strong {{based his}} {{empirical}} approach {{on the idea}} that interests were on a dimension of liking <b>to</b> <b>disliking</b> {{that could be used to}} discriminate among various occupational groups. In other words, Strong developed several scales that contrasted groups of people, based on their answers. This method of scaling, developed by Strong, has been very influential and has been used in several different questionnaires, including the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI).|$|R
25|$|After {{eight years}} of marriage, Marie Antoinette {{gave birth to a}} daughter, Marie Thérèse of France, the first of her four children. Despite her initial popularity, a growing number of the {{population}} eventually came <b>to</b> <b>dislike</b> her, accusing her of being profligate, promiscuous, and of harbouring sympathies for France's enemies, particularly her native Austria. The Affair of the Diamond Necklace damaged her reputation further. During the Revolution, she became known as Madame Déficit because the country's financial crisis was blamed on her lavish spending and her opposition to the social and financial reforms of Turgot and Necker.|$|E
25|$|The Army {{was showing}} renewed {{interest}} in opening the Mississippi River at just this time, and Porter met two men who would have great influence on the campaign. First was Major General William T. Sherman, a man of similar temperament to his own, with whom he immediately formed a particularly strong friendship. The other was Major General McClernand, whom he just as quickly came <b>to</b> <b>dislike.</b> Later they would be joined by Major General Ulysses S. Grant; Grant and Porter became friends and worked together quite well, but {{it was on a}} more strictly professional level than his relation with Sherman.|$|E
25|$|Kaufmann {{also worked}} on private projects. In 1917 he {{accepted}} the commission by Leo Lewin for the interior of his villa in Breslau. Some of Kaufmann's first private commissions consisted {{of a series of}} villas built in and around Berlin, many of which still survive. Kaufmann, however, soon grew <b>to</b> <b>dislike</b> designing villas and other single-family dwellings, as they did not prove financially profitable enough for his firm. He returned to theater building and constructed two notable theaters during this time, the Theater am Kurfürstendamm and the Krolloper. The latter took nine years to build, from 1920 to 1929.|$|E
