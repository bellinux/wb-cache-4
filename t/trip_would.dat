5|$|Early in 1940, Steinbeck and Ricketts hired a Monterey Bay sardine fishing boat, the Western Flyer, with a four-man crew, {{and spent}} six weeks {{travelling}} {{the coast of}} the Gulf of California collecting biological specimens. Along with Ricketts and the four crew members mentioned in the book, Steinbeck was accompanied by his wife, Carol. Steinbeck hoped that the <b>trip</b> <b>would</b> help rescue their failing marriage, but it seems to have had the opposite effect: the marriage ended soon after they returned. Steinbeck's lawyer and friend, Toby Street, was also on board as far as San Diego.|$|E
5|$|Although Hudson {{anticipated}} that the <b>trip</b> <b>would</b> take less than a month, it took 56 days. Most of the journey was by water, and ice on the Niagara River, inclement weather and ice on Lake Erie, and unnavigable portions of the Cuyahoga River contributed to the travelers' slow progress. Although ice on Lake Erie and the Buffalo River near Niagara Falls destroyed one boat, the group reached Cleaveland (present-day Cleveland, Ohio) on June 9, 1799. After purchasing more supplies, they set off down the Cuyahoga River. Although Hudson believed that the river could carry their boats {{as far south as}} required, they only reached present-day Northfield on June 20. When the settlers arrived in the vicinity of their parcel they had difficulty locating its four boundary markers, finding the southwest marker in late June. Only one of the two groups herding cattle overland reached the settlement.|$|E

25|$|In 1942, {{there were}} {{increased}} demands {{for the protection}} of shipping as new convoy systems were created. Protection of convoys bringing material and workers to Goose Bay, Labrador {{for the construction of a}} large Royal Canadian Air Force base was required. The convoys would depart Quebec and bring the material to the drop off point at Hamilton Inlet in Labrador and the return <b>trip</b> <b>would</b> be made by the now-empty vessels. To provide escort for the new convoys, two s were reassigned from tanker escort duty in July 1942.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his regular New York engagements, Caruso gave recitals and operatic performances in {{a large number of}} cities across the United States and sang in Canada. He also continued to sing widely in Europe, appearing again at Covent Garden in 1904–07 and 1913–14, and undertaking a UK tour in 1909. Audiences in France, Belgium, Monaco, Austria, Hungary and Germany also heard him before the outbreak of World War I. In 1909, Melba asked him to participate in her forthcoming tour of Australia, but he declined because of the significant amount of travel time that such a <b>trip</b> <b>would</b> entail.|$|E
25|$|Key {{points in}} the trip were filmed by Academy Award winning cinematographer from Hollywood, Floyd Crosby, who would later be praised {{for his work on}} High Noon. Also along for the trip were several dozen Alberta cowboys and a large film crew. To map the route of the expedition, the Canadian {{government}} sent along two geographers, Frank Swannell and Ernest Lemarque. The expedition started off at Edmonton, Alberta on 6 July 1934 and their goal was to travel 1500 miles to Telegraph Creek, British Columbia. Much of the <b>trip</b> <b>would</b> have to be made through regions that were relatively uncharted and had no trails.|$|E

25|$|Transport Canada made {{a request}} for {{proposal}} for an airport rail link in April 2001. In May 2003, the submissions were pared down to four pre-qualified private consortia, who were then invited to submit business cases. An SNC-Lavalin subsidiary named the Union Pearson AirLink Group {{was selected as the}} successful respondent to finance, design, construct, operate and maintain an airport rail link on November 13, 2003. The service was to be called Blue22, as a <b>trip</b> <b>would</b> take 22 minutes to or from Pearson with a stop at the Bloor GO/Dundas West TTC Station. Trains were to be refurbished Budd Rail Diesel Cars, and were expected to begin running between 2008 and 2010.|$|E
25|$|This season, Major League Baseball {{scheduled}} the Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks to {{open the}} season with a two-game series at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Australia. As a result, both teams began spring training earlier than usual and played abbreviated Cactus League schedules before flying to Australia for the series. Several members of the Dodgers organization expressed their dislike of the way the <b>trip</b> <b>would</b> impact their normal-preseason routine and their concern over the travel. As a result, the media started portraying the Dodgers in a negative light, contrasted with the Diamondbacks seemingly supportive stance on the trip. A few days {{before the start of the}} series, the Dodgers played an exhibition game against the Australian national baseball team.|$|E
25|$|In December 1996, Hall and E.K. Slaughter, a friend, {{and their}} wives visited the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

Greg Hilton, the director of the now-defunct NCSF, had no funding for such trips; he only arranged them with CNMI officials. Hilton said he was led to believe by officials of Preston Gates that the CNMI would pay the expenses and be reimbursed by the private sector.

25|$|Southwest Airlines, {{founded in}} 1971 and {{headquartered}} at Love Field, built its business on selling quick, no-frills trips between Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. The company {{felt that the}} notion of a quick <b>trip</b> <b>would</b> be destroyed by a long drive to the new airport. Prior to the opening of DFW, Southwest Airlines sued for the right to remain at Love Field. In 1973 the courts ruled that the City of Dallas could not restrict Southwest Airlines from operating out of Love Field, so long as it remained open as an airport. This ruling effectively granted Southwest the right to continue to operate its existing intrastate service out of Love Field. The airlines operating from Love Field at the time DFW was conceived executed agreements with DFW stipulating that no airline could operate at the new airport if it continued to operate any flights out of Love Field. Southwest, created after the other carriers had signed on to the DFW operating agreements, was not a signatory and remained as the only airline operating at Love Field.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the show}} {{documented}} the housemates as they {{struggled to find}} and maintain jobs and careers in their new locales, with minimal group activities aside from their day-to-day lives {{in the house and}} their socializing in the city. The only group activity engineered by the producers during the first season was a trip for the three females to Jamaica. By the second season, sending the entire cast on a vacation and/or short-term local <b>trip</b> <b>would</b> become the norm for most seasons. By the fifth season, the cast would be given an ongoing, season-long activity, with the Miami cast given startup money and a business advisor to begin their own business. This aspect of the show remained in most subsequent seasons. The assignments are obligatory, with casts assigned to work at an after-school daycare program, a radio station, public-access television station, etc. Beginning with the , a rule was implemented that required a roommate fired from the group job to be evicted from the house and dropped from the cast. 's Greg Halstead and 's Joey Rozmus were evicted from their respective houses after they were fired from their group jobs. Beginning in the 28th season, certain jobs in the area were approved by production that the cast had the liberty to apply for independently if desired.|$|E
25|$|During summer months, C.D. Howe made {{an annual}} voyage to the Eastern Arctic. During winter months, C.D. Howe {{performed}} icebreaking {{operations in the}} Gulf of St. Lawrence. The vessel was also used to train Canadian Coast Guard College cadets. The ship's annual voyage to the Eastern Arctic consisted of resupplying northern settlements, activating navigation aids {{in the north and}} providing medical and dental services to remote communities. C.D. Howe carried personnel from the Departments of Natural Resources and Northern Affairs along with members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police while performing its duties. The annual <b>trip</b> <b>would</b> take the vessel to northern Labrador, along the south and east coasts of Baffin Island and stopping at Ellesmere Island. C.D. Howe operated as a hospital ship, carrying two doctors, two dentists and two nurses while travelling through the Arctic. The ship stopped at remote Aboriginal communities and provided medical services to the inhabitants, while also screening them for signs of tuberculosis. This was at times, performed against the will of the inhabitants, with the vessel forcibly removing those Aboriginals who were considered by the medical professionals aboard to need further care. The forcible removal of some of those patients, sometimes without warning to family members, caused distress among the remote populations, causing some to flee the sight of the ship upon its arrival in Aboriginal communities. As part of Canada's attempt to assert sovereignty over its Arctic territory, C.D. Howe, along with the icebreaker , relocated Inuit that had been removed from their settlement at Port Harrison to new communities at Resolute and Grise Fiord in August and September 1953. In 1962, C.D. Howe, {{along with the rest of}} the Department of Transport's maritime fleet, was transferred to the newly created Canadian Coast Guard and the vessel was given the new prefix CCGS.|$|E
