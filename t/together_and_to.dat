5|$|Spot welding is {{a popular}} {{resistance}} welding method used to join overlapping metal sheets of up to 3mm thick. Two electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> pass current through the sheets. The advantages of the method include efficient energy use, limited workpiece deformation, high production rates, easy automation, and no required filler materials. Weld strength is significantly lower than with other welding methods, making the process suitable for only certain applications. It is used extensively in the automotive industry—ordinary cars can have several thousand spot welds made by industrial robots. A specialized process, called shot welding, {{can be used to}} spot weld stainless steel.|$|E

Basting is {{the practice}} of making long, loose stitches in a grid format {{across the surface of}} the quilt to hold the layers of the quilt <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> prevent them from shifting during the quilting process. Basting can also be done using large curved safety pins rather than machine or hand basting.|$|E

25|$|A cable tie, {{also known}} as a zip tie or tie-wrap, is a type of fastener, {{especially}} for binding several electronic cables or wires <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> organize cables and wires. They have also been commonly used as makeshift handcuffs, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and in Panama. The cable tie, originally known as the Ty-Rap, was invented in 1958 by Maurus C. Logan, who worked for many years at Thomas & Betts. Logan filed U.S. patent #3,022,557 on June 24, 1958 which was issued to him on February 27, 1962.|$|E
25|$|W. T. Cosgrave was a small, quiet man, and at 42 was {{the oldest}} member of the Cabinet. He had not sought the {{leadership}} of the new country, but once it was his he made good use of it. One of his chief priorities was to hold the new country <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> prove that the Irish could govern themselves. Some historians have claimed that he lacked vision as a leader and was surrounded by men who were more capable than himself. However, during his ten years as President he proved an able leader of the emerging Irish state who had a sound judgement on the matters of state that the new country was facing.|$|E

25|$|The M7A was an open-wheeled {{single-seater}} with a mid-mounted engine {{driving the}} rear wheels. The chassis was a bathtub-type (i.e. open-topped) monocoque made from 22-gauge aluminium alloy and 20-gauge magnesium alloy panels glued and riveted <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> three steel bulkheads. The monocoque terminated behind the driver's seat {{and the engine}} {{was used as a}} stressed part of the chassis, bolted directly to the rearmost bulkhead. The gearbox was then attached behind the engine, and the rear suspension – consisting of lateral top links, twin radius arms and reversed wishbones– attached to the gearbox and the rear bulkhead. The front suspension – upper and lower lateral links and radius arms – and the steering column were attached to the two bulkheads in front of the driver. Coilover springs and Koni dampers mounted outside of the body were employed front and rear.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneously as Mehamn {{was awarded}} an airport, Parliament voted {{to build a}} new road, National Road 888, which would better winter {{transport}} between the villages of Kjøllefjord, Mehamn and Gamvik, allow Mehamn Airport to efficiently serve the entire peninsula. Construction was subcontracted to Veidekke. From they started construction in late 1973; it took 39 days from start until the first aircraft landed. Mehamn airport opened on 1 August 1974, {{at the same time as}} Sørkjosen Airport, Hammerfest Airport, Berlevåg Airport and Vadsø Airport. Because of late payment the airport remained owned by Veidekke until 1976. Both Widerøe and Norving applied to operate the Finnmark route, which would connect the airports <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the primary airports in Finnmark and Tromsø Airport. Norving planned to operate with their Britten-Norman Islanders and Britten-Norman Trislanders. The government opted to selected Widerøe and their Twin Otters, citing the need for a single operator for all subsidized regional routes in the country.|$|E
25|$|The NYSE {{trades in}} a {{continuous}} auction format, where traders can execute stock transactions on behalf of investors. They will gather around the appropriate post where a specialist broker, who is employed by a NYSE member firm (that is, he/she is not {{an employee of the}} New York Stock Exchange), acts as an auctioneer in an open outcry auction market environment to bring buyers and sellers <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> manage the actual auction. They do on occasion (approximately 10% of the time) facilitate the trades by committing their own capital {{and as a matter of}} course disseminate information to the crowd that helps to bring buyers and sellers together. The auction process moved toward automation in 1995 through the use of wireless hand held computers (HHC). The system enabled traders to receive and execute orders electronically via wireless transmission. On September 25, 1995, NYSE member Michael Einersen, who designed and developed this system, executed 1000 shares of IBM through this HHC ending a 203-year process of paper transactions and ushering in an era of automated trading.|$|E

25|$|Equipment bonding {{conductors}} {{provide a}} low impedance path between normally non-current-carrying metallic parts of equipment and one of the conductors of that electrical system's source. If any exposed metal part should become energized (fault), such as by a frayed or damaged conductor, it creates a short circuit, causing the overprotection device (circuit breaker or fuse) to open, clearing (disconnecting) the fault. It is important to note this action occurs regardless of whether there is a connection to the physical ground (earth); the earth itself has no role in this fault-clearing process since current must return to its source; however, the sources are very frequently connected to the physical ground (earth). (see Kirchhoff's circuit laws). By bonding (interconnecting) all exposed non-current carrying metal objects <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> other metallic objects such as pipes or structural steel, they should remain near the same voltage potential, thus reducing the chance of a shock. This is especially important in bathrooms where one may be in contact with several different metallic systems such as supply and drain pipes and appliance frames. When a system needs to be connected to the physical ground (earth), the equipment bonding conductor also becomes the equipment earthing conductor (see above).|$|E
25|$|A {{few weeks}} after the start of the pre-season, yet {{prior to the start of}} the {{competitive}} season, the club opens its doors for free for all Feyenoord fans to have fun <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> present the squad for the upcoming season. De Kuip already opens in the morning when there are many activities around the stadium mainly for kids and promotional activities for companies which have a partnership with Feyenoord. Fans can also take a stadium tour and walk on the pitch. The activities inside the stadium itself normally start around noon, when there are several performances by various artists. Every year, the new Feyenoord ambassador of the year is announced at opening day. A minute of silence is held for all former Feyenoord players who have died and for known fans who have died in the previous year. Former Feyenoord players return to De Kuip every year to play versus a team of Dutch celebrities. The stadium activities end after the squad for the upcoming season is presented to the fans. This is always a special happening, mainly for the new signings of the team. They will be flown into the stadium with helicopters when a full stadium is cheering for them when they arrive. Once they are there, the other players and club officials enter the pitch one by one. Last but not least, all players are available for autograph sessions afterwards. Feyenoord's open day attracts approximately 60,000 to 70,000 fans towards Rotterdam, coming from all over the Netherlands, while there are only 51,117 seats available within the stadium. The opening day is known as a unique event in the Netherlands.|$|E

According to Cynthia Webb, the rain represented [...] "unfulfilled longing", while Bradly Storm saw water as a third main character to the story, acting to both bring Takao and Yukari <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> symbolize the renewal of life. Kaze felt that the rain symbolized their lonely states, though also acknowledging Shinkai's statement that the rain symbolized uncontrollable love. Following the reasoning that rain symbolized their lonely states, Kaze noted that the tanka had not only romantic intentions, but was also a [...] "simple plea" [...] by Yukari for someone to stay with her, even when she's no longer lonely, and not just out of pity.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{moderate}} success of Nelson's singles, Atlantic Records' executives were unhappy with Nelson's style, and closed their Country Music division in September 1974. Wexler protested to Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun, arguing that Atlantic had Willie Nelson. The Ertegun brothers replied [...] "Willie Who? Go ahead and close it." [...] Following the division's closure, Wexler resigned. The album sold 400,000 copies, and Nelson {{was released from}} his Atlantic contract, prompting Columbia Records' executives to offer Nelson a contract giving him complete creative control of his works. Wexler later described Phases and Stages and Shotgun Willie as [...] "...generally viewed as having set Willie on a new path ... it was the coalescing of his audience, where the rednecks and the hippies came <b>together.</b> <b>And</b> <b>to</b> this day, that's Willie's audience." ...|$|E

Nobody knows what went on inside of these guys and for them to stick <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> play like they played tonight, and like they have tried in every game, it says a lot about them." [...] Defensive end Ryan Van Bergen, who recorded 2.5 sacks, three tackles for loss and seven tackles overall, was named the Big Ten's Co-Defensive Player of the Week. Toussaint's 65-yard touchdown run and his total of 192 rushing yards were career highs.|$|E

500|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, when Tillemont wrote his Histoire des Empereurs, {{it was no}} longer {{possible}} to make the argument that Philip was a Christian [...] "ſans difficulté", [...] "without difficulty". And when Jean-Baptiste Louis Crévier wrote his L'Histoire des empereurs des Romains, jusqu'à Constantin in 1749, he affirmed the contrary, that Philip was not a Christian at all: [...] "...it is easy to judge what degree of credit ought to be given to this story of his penance; which, besides, is not fully and exactly related by any ancient author. To make out an account of it any way tolerable, they have been obliged to patch several evidences <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> supply and alter the one by the other. The shortest and safest course is not to admit of a perplexed and ill supported narrative. We have no great temptation to torture history in order to claim such a Christian." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of Bradley and Chapman's contributions, the 1920s saw a boom in Austen scholarship, and the novelist E. M. Forster {{primarily}} illustrated his concept of the [...] "round" [...] character by citing Austen's works. It was with the 1939 publication of Mary Lascelles' Jane Austen and Her Art—"the first full-scale historical and scholarly study" [...] of Austen—that the academic study of her works matured. Lascelles included a short biographical essay; an innovative analysis of the books Austen read and their effect on her writing; and an extended analysis of Austen's style and her [...] "narrative art". Lascelles felt that prior critics had all worked on a scale [...] "so small that the reader does not see how they have reached their conclusions until he has patiently found his own way to them". She wished to examine all Austen's works <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> subject her style and techniques to methodical analysis. Subsequent critics agree that she succeeded. Like Bradley earlier, she emphasised Austen's connection to Samuel Johnson and her desire to discuss morality through fiction. However, at the time some fans of Austen worried that academics were taking over Austen criticism {{and that it was}} becoming increasingly esoteric—a debate that continued into the 21st century.|$|E
