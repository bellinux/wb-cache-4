50|$|The Teletype Model 28 RT Set is {{punched tape}} message and data relay set that receives, punches, prints, stores, reads and transmits five-level paper tape. The {{receiving}} unit accepts incoming electrical signals and punches and prints the intelligence on five-level paper tape. The sending unit reads and translates the taped intelligence into electrical impulses for transmission either cross-office or cross-country. The paper tape readers and punches can be geared at {{speeds up to}} 200 words-per-minute. Gears are also available for slower speed operation at 60, 75 or 100 words-per-minute. Optional three-speed gear-shift mechanisms are also available for manual speed change operation at speeds of 60, 75 and 100 words-per-minute. The tape handling unit contains a large capacity tape supply reel capable of storing up to 3000 feet of paper tape, an intermediate tape storage bin that handles approximately 100 feet of paper tape and a <b>tape</b> <b>winder</b> reel that will store 1000 feet of paper tape. The Model 28 RT Set, less cabinet, is 35 inches high, 8.5 inches wide and 20 inches deep and weighs 110 pounds. The Model 20 RT Set cabinet, which houses up to two RT Sets, is 60 inches high, 28 inches wide and 27 inches deep and weighs 300 pounds. The RT Set cabinets may be side mounted.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{description}} of the industrial machine of the DWT (drywall <b>tape)</b> rewinder. The <b>winder</b> rewinds and cuts the drywall tape tape into smaller tapes, that are then sold. The first part contains a description of the winder, its structure and functions of its individual parts. The second part contains a description of the control system and the power wiring of winder. The next section contains a description of programming and setting of PLC, frequency inverters, and touch panel. Some modifications are then described when putting the winder into operation. The winder has been successfully implemented and built into a continuous shift operation. However, the development of the rewinder continues to improve its features and user-friendliness...|$|R
