5|$|If {{there is}} {{anything}} <b>that</b> <b>humanity</b> cannot produce, the being who produces it is better than humanity. But humanity cannot produce {{the things that are}} in the universe – the heavenly bodies, etc. The being, therefore, who produces them is superior to humanity. But who is there that is superior to humanity, except God? Therefore, God exists.|$|E
5|$|In The Biggest Secret (1999), he {{introduced}} {{the idea that}} many prominent figures derive from the Anunnaki, a reptilian race from the Draco constellation. In Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More (2012), he identified the Moon (and later Saturn) {{as the source of}} holographic experiences, broadcast by the reptiles, <b>that</b> <b>humanity</b> interprets as reality.|$|E
5|$|In his ancient-astronaut narrative, Icke argues <b>that</b> <b>humanity</b> {{has been}} genetically {{manipulated}} by the Babylonian Brotherhood, a hybrid race of human–extraterrestrial reptilians, {{also known as}} the Illuminati. He briefly introduced the extraterrestrial hypothesis in The Robot's Rebellion (1994), citing Bill Cooper's Behold a Pale Horse (1991), and expanded it in And the Truth Shall Set You Free (1995), citing Barbara Marciniak's Bringers of the Dawn (1992).|$|E

3000|$|... 21 Similarly, Bar and Zussman ([2012]) shows <b>that</b> <b>humanities</b> {{courses at}} the College of Arts and Sciences of an elite {{university}} in the United States provide higher grades than natural sciences ones.|$|R
5|$|The poem {{discusses}} {{time and}} disorder within nature {{that is the}} result of humanity following only science and not the divine. Leaders are described as materialistic and unable to understand reality. The only way for mankind to find salvation is through pursuing the divine by looking inwards and realizing <b>that</b> <b>humanity</b> is interconnected. Only then can people understand the universe.|$|E
5|$|Chryssides {{states that}} Raëlism is {{discernible}} from other UFO religions for its heavy support for physicalism and repudiation of supernaturalism. Susan J. Palmer, a social scholar {{who had long}} contacts with Raëlians, associated epiphenomenalism with the belief in Raëlism that mind transfer coupled with human cloning can implant mind and personality into a new and disease free body. Raëlians publicly deny {{the existence of the}} ethereal soul and a supernatural god, but they believe <b>that</b> <b>humanity</b> for many generations past will be resurrected, albeit in a scientific way.|$|E
5|$|Kelsey Munro {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, suggesting that it is pessimistic and does not present any false hope. But he says pessimism {{is not the same}} thing as fatalism, and Hamilton believes there is still an urgent need for government intervention to avoid worst-case scenarios by reducing emissions. Munro also points out that some eminent climate scientists, like Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer, remain optimistic <b>that</b> <b>humanity</b> will act before it is too late.|$|E
50|$|Arthur C. Clarke (1950) {{presented}} {{a summary of}} motivations for the human exploration of space in his non-fiction semi-technical monograph Interplanetary Flight. He argued <b>that</b> <b>humanity's</b> choice is essentially between expansion off Earth into space, versus cultural (and eventually biological) stagnation and death.|$|R
50|$|When human civilization {{was still}} in its infancy, Embra's boldest explorers bravely crossed the barrier between the two worlds, and quickly {{realized}} <b>that</b> <b>humanity's</b> reactions towards them could be unpredictable and violent. Alongside this, Earth's weak flow of magical power made it uninhabitable to them.|$|R
500|$|In 1926, Tesla {{commented on}} the ills of the social subservience {{of women and the}} {{struggle}} of women toward gender equality, and indicated <b>that</b> <b>humanity's</b> future would be run by [...] "Queen Bees." [...] He believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future.|$|R
5|$|Mary Shelley {{believed}} in the Enlightenment idea that people could improve society through the responsible exercise of political power, but she feared that the irresponsible exercise of power would lead to chaos. In practice, her works largely criticise the way 18th-century thinkers such as her parents believed such change could be brought about. The creature in Frankenstein, for example, reads books associated with radical ideals but the education he gains from them is ultimately useless. Shelley's works reveal her as less optimistic than Godwin and Wollstonecraft; she lacks faith in Godwin's theory <b>that</b> <b>humanity</b> could eventually be perfected.|$|E
5|$|Michaud {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>humanity</b> {{could be}} impacted by {{an influx of}} extraterrestrial science and technology {{in the same way}} that medieval European scholars were impacted by the knowledge of Arab scientists. Humanity might at first revere the knowledge as having the potential to advance the human species, and might even feel inferior to the extraterrestrial species, but would gradually grow in arrogance as it gained more and more intimate knowledge of the science, technology, and other cultural developments of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.|$|E
5|$|New Age thought {{typically}} envisions {{the world}} as developing through cosmological cycles which can be identified astrologically. It adopts this concept from Theosophy, although often presents it in a looser and more eclectic way than is found in Theosophical teaching. New Age literature often claims <b>that</b> <b>humanity</b> once lived {{in an age of}} spiritual wisdom. In the writings of New Agers like Edgar Cayce, the ancient period of spiritual wisdom is associated with concepts of supremely-advanced societies living on lost continents such as Atlantis, Lemuria, and Mu, as well as the idea that ancient societies like those of Ancient Egypt were far more technologically advanced than modern scholarship accepts.|$|E
50|$|Since {{nature is}} all there is, {{and there was}} once no life, {{abiogenesis}} is implied: that life arose spontaneously from natural causes. Naturalists reason about how, not if evolution happened. They maintain <b>that</b> <b>humanity's</b> existence is not by intelligent design but rather a natural process of emergence.|$|R

5|$|The Platonic {{influence}} on Maximus' thought {{can be seen}} most clearly in his theological anthropology. Here, Maximus adopted the Platonic model of exitus-reditus (exit and return), teaching <b>that</b> <b>humanity</b> {{was made in the}} image of God, and the purpose of salvation is to restore us to unity with God. This emphasis on divinization or theosis helped secure Maximus' place in Eastern theology, as these concepts have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{had argued}} <b>that</b> <b>humanity</b> evolved in Africa, {{because this is}} where great apes like gorillas and {{chimpanzees}} lived. Though Darwin's claims have since been vindicated by the fossil record, they were proposed without any fossil evidence. Other scientific authorities disagreed with him, like Charles Lyell, a geologist, and Alfred Russel Wallace, who had thought {{of the theory of}} evolution around the same time as Darwin. Because both Lyell and Wallace believed that humans were more closely related to gibbons and orangutans, they identified Southeast Asia as the cradle of humanity because this is where these apes lived. Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois favored the latter theory, and sought to confirm it.|$|E
5|$|John Calvin, a sixteenth-century French theologian and {{principal}} {{figure in the}} development of Calvinism, was influenced by Augustine's works. Unlike Augustine, Calvin was willing to accept that God is responsible for evil and suffering; however, he maintained that God cannot be indicted for it. Calvin continued the Augustinian approach that sin {{is the result of the}} fall of man, and argued that the human mind, will, and affections are corrupted by sin. He believed that only the grace of God is sufficient to provide humans with ongoing ethical guidance, arguing that reason is blinded by humans' sinful nature. Calvin proposed <b>that</b> <b>humanity</b> is predestined, divided into the elect and the reprobate: the elect are those who God has chosen to save and are the only ones who will be saved.|$|E
25|$|There is {{empirical}} evidence <b>that</b> graduates from <b>humanities</b> programs {{earn less than}} graduates from other university programs. However, the {{empirical evidence}} also shows <b>that</b> <b>humanities</b> graduates still earn notably higher incomes than workers with no postsecondary education. Humanities graduates also earn more as their careers progress; ten years after graduation, the income difference between humanities graduates and graduates from other university programs is no longer statistically significant. Humanities graduates can earn even higher incomes if they obtain advanced or professional degrees.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the History Channel's special Life After People, Aftermath {{features}} {{what scientists}} and others speculate the earth, animal life, and plant life {{might be like}} if humanity no longer existed, {{as well as the}} effect <b>that</b> <b>humanity's</b> disappearance would have on the artifacts of civilization.Both documentaries are inspired by Alan Weisman's The World Without Us.|$|R
50|$|The {{function}} {{of higher education}} was highly debated at the time. There was growing concern that American schools and colleges were failing to meet critical national demands, particularly the need for scientists, engineers, and high-level technicians. This anxiety, in turn, generated another concern - fear <b>that</b> <b>humanities</b> studies would become overshadowed by an emphasis on science and engineering.|$|R
5|$|Later, a huge onboard {{television}} screen displays an emergency message {{from a military}} officer, warning the crew and passengers about a deadly virus that has started to spread on the mainland. He says that all ships must remain at sea to ensure <b>that</b> <b>humanity</b> survives. The message is actually taken from a movie in the Simpson cabin's DVD library, set up by Bart to broadcast all over the ship. He also disables communications with the mainland by pouring hot fudge on a control panel. As the ship stays at sea, conditions deteriorate and the food supply starts to run out. Eventually, the cruise turns into a post-apocalyptic civilization, with gladiator arenas, marauders, capital punishment, and Priddis claiming kingship over the passengers.|$|E
5|$|Raëlians believe <b>that</b> <b>{{humanity}}</b> {{would be}} able to create life on other planets only if humanity is peaceful enough to stop war. In that case, humanity could travel the distances between stars and create life on another planet. Progress in terraforming, molecular biology, and cloning would enable these teams to create continents and life from scratch. Progress in social engineering would ensure that this creation would {{have a better chance of}} both surviving and having the potential to understand its creators. Research on how civilization would occur on another planet would allow scientists to decide what traces of their origin should be left behind so that their role in life creation would someday be revealed. The progress achieved by the science teams would ultimately sustain a perpetual chain of life.|$|E
5|$|Rewrite story {{revolves}} around the protagonist Kotarou Tennouji, a male high school student living in Kazamatsuri, and the story begins on October 3, 2010 on the Moon. Kotarou, who {{is interested in the}} mysteries of Kazamatsuri, especially the reports of unidentified mysterious animals, spends times with five girls in the occult research society at his school: Kotori Kanbe, Chihaya Ohtori, Sizuru Nakatsu, Lucia Konohana, and Akane Senri, who is also the club president. The club members spend fun, peaceful times together uncovering the supernatural mysteries of Kazamatsuri. During this time, Kotarou falls in love with each of them in separate plot lines determined by the choices the player makes. These plot lines represent various timelines in which the conflict between Gaia and Guardian occurs, although it is hinted <b>that</b> <b>humanity</b> is inevitably destroyed in every timeline.|$|E

50|$|Very little {{context is}} given about {{the setting of}} the show. Of that which can be discerned (explained by Gedächtnis), the {{characters}} reside in a gigantic manor surrounded by a presumably Robot-inhabited city, beyond which is a desert <b>that</b> <b>humanity's</b> forces slowly encroach across during the 144-year timeframe in which the series is set (Merkur Era 58,650-58,793).|$|R
5000|$|Fukuyama {{has also}} stated that his thesis was incomplete, but for a {{different}} reason: [...] "there can be no end of history without an end of modern natural science and technology" [...] (quoted from Our Posthuman Future). Fukuyama predicts <b>that</b> <b>humanity's</b> control of its own evolution will have a great and possibly terrible effect on liberal democracy.|$|R
5|$|Scully {{contacts}} Mulder, {{who is now}} resting at home. He {{believes that}} the artifact proves <b>that</b> <b>humanity</b> was created by aliens. Diana Fowley, who is with Mulder, contacts the Cigarette Smoking Man. A healing ceremony is held for Albert, but Scully is forced to leave when Skinner contacts her, telling her Mulder is in the hospital. Mulder {{is being held in}} a padded cell and is displaying abnormal brain activity. Scully, after learning that Skinner knows about their earlier conversation with Burks, calls him and Fowley liars and leaves. Scully is about to find a surveillance camera in the X-Files office when she is called by Sandoz telling her that the artifact contains information on human genetics. Sandoz is killed by Krycek shortly afterwards. Scully then heads to the West African Coast where she discovers that the artifact is part of a large spacecraft partially buried in the beach.|$|E
5|$|The Megans are {{determined}} to put humanity and the Enterprise crew on trial for what humans did to their people during the Salem witch-trials as well as Lucien for bringing them here. Kirk comes out in support of Lucien's life and says that killing him would make the Megans just like humans. Lucien's punishment is to be condemned into limbo for eternity for bringing humans into the Megans' world. While Kirk states <b>that</b> <b>humanity</b> has progressed infinitely since 1691, the Megans ignore his words. At {{the end of the}} trial, Kirk offers his life to save Lucien's and the Megans are so impressed by the captain's gesture that they spare Lucien, and tell the Enterprise that they would welcome future human visits to their planet. They also return the Enterprise to its proper universe, while Lucien is revealed to be Lucifer.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} scenarios for known risks {{that can have}} a global impact on the planet. From the perspective of humanity, these can be subdivided into survivable risks and terminal risks. Risks <b>that</b> <b>humanity</b> pose to itself include climate change, the misuse of nanotechnology, a nuclear holocaust, warfare with a programmed superintelligence, a genetically engineered disease, or a disaster caused by a physics experiment. Similarly, several natural events may pose a doomsday threat, including a highly virulent disease, the impact of an asteroid or comet, runaway greenhouse effect, and resource depletion. There {{may also be the}} possibility of an infestation by an extraterrestrial lifeform. The actual odds of these scenarios are difficult if not impossible to deduce.|$|E
