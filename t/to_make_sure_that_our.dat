2500|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} campaign, Romney took positions on agricultural subsidies that some media reports characterized as vague and somewhat contradictory. In May 2011, {{just days after}} rival Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty had declared that federal subsidies {{for the production of}} ethanol fuel should be phased out, Romney said that he was a supporter of ethanol subsidies. Five months later, while speaking on agricultural subsidies at a roundtable discussion with Iowa farmers and business leaders, Romney said, “I’m not running for office based on making promises of handing out money.... We’re {{going to have to live}} within our means.” He also said that while he had supported ethanol subsidies in the past in order to help the ethanol fuel industry become established, and that he continued to believe that ethanol should play a role in meeting the nation’s energy needs, he agreed with the discontinuation of the tax credit for production of ethanol from corn that was scheduled to occur two months later. On the subject of agricultural subsidies more generally, Romney wrote in response to a 2012 questionnaire from the American Farm Bureau Federation that [...] "other nations subsidize their farmers, so we [...] must be careful not to unilaterally change our policies in a way that would [...] disadvantage agriculture here in our country." [...] He made similar remarks on the campaign trail in August 2012, without explicitly referring to subsidies: [...] "We don't want to find ourselves with regards to our food supply in the same kind of position we are in with our energy supply, so it's important for us <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> farmers are able to stay on the farm and raise the crops that we need to have a secure source of food. So I believe in supports that will allow us to do that." ...|$|E
60|$|Buller was {{now moving}} with a rapidity and {{decision}} which contrast pleasantly {{with some of}} his earlier operations. Although Dundee was only occupied on May 15th, on May 18th his vanguard was in Newcastle, fifty miles to the north. In nine days he had covered 138 miles. On the 19th the army lay under the loom of that Majuba which had cast its sinister shadow for so long over South African politics. In front was the historical Laing's Nek, the pass which leads from Natal into the Transvaal, while through it runs the famous railway tunnel. Here the Boers had taken up that position which had proved nineteen years before to be too strong for British troops. The Rooineks had come back after many days to try again. A halt was called, for the ten days' supplies which had been taken with the troops were exhausted, and it was necessary to wait until the railway should be repaired. This gave time for Hildyard's 5th Division and Lyttelton's 4th Division to close up on Clery's 2nd Division, which with Dundonald's cavalry had formed our vanguard throughout. The only losses of any consequence during this fine march fell upon a single squadron of Bethune's mounted infantry, which being thrown out in the direction of Vryheid, in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> flank was clear, fell into an ambuscade and was almost annihilated by a close-range fire. Sixty-six casualties, of which nearly half were killed, were the result of this action, which seems to have depended, like most of our reverses, upon defective scouting. Buller, having called up his two remaining divisions and having mended the railway behind him, proceeded now to manoeuvre the Boers out of Laing's Nek exactly as he had manoeuvred them out of the Biggarsberg. At the end of May Hildyard and Lyttelton were despatched in an eastern direction, as if there were an intention of turning the pass from Utrecht.|$|E

5000|$|Asked {{about nuclear}} power in South Australia, Malinauskas in 2014 {{said he was}} pro-nuclear despite Labor at the time {{remaining}} opposed {{to the establishment of}} a new nuclear waste repository or nuclear power plant in South Australia. Malinauskas stated [...] "I believe climate change is a real challenge we need to face up to, and nuclear energy can be a safe source of base load power, with zero carbon emissions" [...] and [...] "we should have a mature debate based on science and economics to determine if a nuclear industry is viable in South Australia". In March 2015 Labor initiated a Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission, and in 2016 launched a [...] "Get to know nuclear" [...] campaign to further explore the Commission's findings. In October 2016 at the South Australian Labor party conference, Malinauskas spoke of the protesters who had gathered outside in opposition to the establishment of new nuclear waste storage facilities. He told delegates: [...] "The difference between us and them, of course, is that we take very seriously our obligation <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> ideology is underpinned by evidence." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{specific}} {{sequence of}} tasks and start times (genes) represents one genome in our population. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> genome is a feasible solution {{we must take}} care that it obeys our precedence constraints. We generate an initial population using random start times within the precedence constraints. With genetic algorithms we then take this initial population and cross it, combining genomes along {{with a small amount}} of randomness (mutation). The offspring of this combination is selected based on a fitness function that includes one or many of our constraints, such as minimizing time and minimizing defects. We let this process continue either for a pre-allotted time or until we find a solution that fits our minimum criteria. Overall each successive generation will have a greater average fitness, i.e. taking less time with higher quality than the preceding generations. In scheduling problems, as with other genetic algorithm solutions, we must make sure that we do not select offspring that are infeasible, such as offspring that violate our precedence constraint. We of course may have to add further fitness values such as minimizing costs; however, each constraint that we add greatly increases the search space and lowers the number of solutions that are good matches.|$|E

Nicole Kidman was also reportedly considered for the role after Judd stepped out of the project, until Halle Berry was chosen and production began. [...] "I checked out some to see how Catwoman is treated in the comics, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> Catwoman was in the same vein. But I didn't want to be too influenced by the comic book, because {{the whole point of the}} movie is to be first a movie, and to be different. Different from [...] "Batman", different from [...] "Spider-Man" [...] - this movie has its own identity. I tried to find my sources more in the character of Catwoman herself. To me, the Catwoman we're filming now with Halle Berry is in the continuity of the others. She's different than Michelle Pfeiffer's character, different from anybody who's played Catwoman in the past. But she is Catwoman. When you look at the differences between the comic book Catwoman and the TV or movie Catwoman, they're all different-but there's a feeling that they are all Catwoman. Halle brings her own personality, through her attitude and through the outfit." [...] —Director Pitof ...|$|E

40|$|The {{beauty of}} {{immersion}} and other content-based programs {{is that our}} students {{have the potential to}} master both language and content through a “reciprocal process ” (Wesche & Skehan, 2002). Thus, while students master language, they are able to learn more content. And as students learn more content, they are able to improve their language skills. Finding the proper balance between the promotion of content learning and language mastery represents one of the challenges that we all face. When we make a commitment to promoting the acquisition of content, we can facilitate the process by meeting three conditions: • First, we need <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> learners consider input {{from a variety of sources}} representing diverse perspectives on related subject matter. • The second condition is that we need to guide our students in revisiting input for different purposes. • And finally, we want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> students have many opportunities to synthesize knowledge that originates from multiple sources. These conditions have been referred to elsewhere as “details of implementation ” (Stoller, 2002 a) ...|$|E
