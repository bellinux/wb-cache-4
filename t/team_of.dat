40|$|Most mobile {{learning}} applications support individual users, although experience with similar conventional learning games indicates that teams {{may be more}} appropriate. This paper reports on tests of the MobileGame to see whether individual users, <b>teams</b> <b>of</b> two, <b>teams</b> <b>of</b> three or <b>teams</b> <b>of</b> four are more successful. The test was conducted with over 100 natural users. The significantly increased activity level and team-building show that a preference for <b>teams</b> <b>of</b> two rather than individual players would be justified. There is little significant evidence to prefer <b>teams</b> <b>of</b> two to <b>teams</b> <b>of</b> three. However, the data shows that <b>teams</b> <b>of</b> four are suboptimal: this team size decreases fun and immersion as well as (maybe) learning. There {{is no evidence that}} these negative effects are balanced by improved team-building. The relatively high success <b>of</b> <b>teams</b> <b>of</b> two leads to a need for more research on dyadic users not only for {{mobile learning}} games, but also for other areas such as tourism, health, museum visitors, and entertainment...|$|R
