5|$|Cockatoos {{are often}} very affectionate with their owner {{and at times}} other people but can demand {{a great deal of}} attention. Furthermore, their intense curiosity means they must be given a steady supply of objects <b>to</b> <b>tinker</b> <b>with,</b> chew, {{dismantle}} and destroy. Parrots in captivity may suffer from boredom, which can lead to stereotypic behaviour patterns, such as feather-plucking. Feather plucking is likely to stem from psychological rather than physical causes. Other major drawbacks include their painful bites, and their piercing screeches. The salmon-crested and white cockatoo species are particular offenders. All cockatoos have a fine powder on their feathers, which may induce allergies in certain people. In general, the smaller cockatoo species such as Goffin's and quieter Galah's cockatoos are much easier to keep as pets. The cockatiel {{is one of the most}} popular and easiest parrots to keep as a pet, and many colour mutations are available in aviculture.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Duke Nukem 3D in 1996, id Software {{released}} the much anticipated Quake. Like Doom, Quake was influential and genre-defining, featuring fast-paced, gory gameplay, but used 3D polygons instead of sprites. It was centered on online gaming and featured multiple match types still found in first-person shooter games today. It was the first FPS game to have a following of player clans (although the concept had existed previously in MechWarrior 2 (Netmech) with its Battletech lore as well as amongst MUD players), and would inspire popular LAN parties such as QuakeCon. The game's popularity and use of 3D polygonal graphics also helped to expand the growing market for video card hardware; and the additional support and encouragement for game modifications attracted players who wanted <b>to</b> <b>tinker</b> <b>with</b> the game and create their own modules. According to creator John Romero, Quakes 3D world was inspired by the 3D fighting game Virtua Fighter. Quake was also intended to expand the genre with Virtua Fighter influenced melee brawling, but this was eventually dropped from the final game.|$|E

Club finding Black Ice the most inspired AC/DC album since The Razors Edge while sounding [...] "harder, hungrier, and more relevant than anything on contemporary radio." [...] A common argument was that Black Ice succeeded because AC/DC {{did not want to}} change the style that succeeded in previous albums, with Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald declaring that given [...] "almost all of [...] could have appeared on any AC/DC album of the past 28 years", and Chris Jones of BBC saying that the band's [...] "almost platonic form of rock 'n' boogie that was hand built to last" [...] remains because they [...] "have no reason <b>to</b> <b>tinker</b> <b>with</b> a formula that was well-nigh perfect to begin with."

500|$|The {{physicists}} at Aldermaston {{had plenty}} of {{ideas about how to}} follow up Grapple X. Possibilities were discussed in September 1957. One was <b>to</b> <b>tinker</b> <b>with</b> the width of the shells in the Dick to find an optimal configuration. If they were too thick, they would slow the neutrons generated by the fusion reaction; if they were too thin, they would give rise to Taylor instability. Another was {{to do away with the}} shells entirely and use a mixture of uranium-235, uranium-238 and deuterium. Ken Allen had an idea, which Sam Curran supported, of a three-layer Dick that used lithium deuteride that was less enriched in lithium-6 (and therefore had more lithium-7), but more of it, reducing the amount of uranium-235 in the centre of the core. This proposal was the one adopted in October, and it became known as [...] "Dickens" [...] because it used Ken's Dick.

[...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars, commenting that [...] "some remixes take considerable liberty, ditching verses or hooks, whatever catches their fancy.
