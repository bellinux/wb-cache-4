They arrived on 19 August, {{the day it}} was signed, expecting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to American scientists, but were unable to do so. Two weeks would pass before American officials learnt of the contents of the Quebec Agreement. Over the next two years, the Combined Policy Committee met only eight times.|$|E

Elaine then reveals that she has recently met a man using a stake out.|$|E

It took me several minutes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> after that." [...] Due to the multiple takes required to perfect the orchestral cacophony and the final chord, the total time spent recording [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] was 34hours. In contrast, the Beatles' debut album, Please Please Me, had been recorded in its entirety in only 10hours, 45minutes.|$|E

Jonny and Plank are inspired by one of Antonucci's childhood friends, a loner who spent most of his time outside with his blanket. He stated that he believed it was important to add Plank, a board of wood, to the show, and that he [...] "thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own" [...] and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do. Some wanted Plank <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> smile and blink as if he was alive, but Antonucci insisted that it should be treated as a piece of wood, brought to life by Jonny's imagination.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, New York artist Sophia Wallace {{started work}} on a {{multimedia}} project to challenge misconceptions about the clitoris. Based on O'Connell's 1998 research, Wallace's work emphasizes the sheer scope {{and size of the}} human clitoris. She says that ignorance of this still seems to be pervasive in modern society. [...] "It is a curious dilemma to observe the paradox that on the one hand the female body is the primary metaphor for sexuality, its use saturates advertising, art and the mainstream erotic imaginary," [...] she said. [...] "Yet, the clitoris, the true female sexual organ, is virtually invisible." [...] The project is called Cliteracy and it includes a [...] "clit rodeo", which is an interactive, climb-on model of a giant golden clitoris, including its inner parts, produced with the help of sculptor Kenneth Thomas. [...] "It's been a showstopper wherever it's been shown. People are hungry <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about this," [...] Wallace said. [...] "I love seeing men standing up for the clit [...] Not having access to the pleasure that is your birthright is a deeply political act." ...|$|E

The next day, Ron withdraws from the budget task force and appoints Leslie in his place. As Tom (Aziz Ansari) and his new girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) are clearing out his office, he notices Ron is wearing a red shirt and black pants, the [...] "Tiger Woods" [...] outfit he always wears the day after having sex. Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) then appears and kisses Ron and the two leave together, shocking Tom.|$|E

2500|$|Pamuk {{stated that}} he was {{consequently}} subjected to a hate campaign that forced him to flee the country. He returned later in 2005, however, to face the charges against him. In an interview with BBC News, {{he said that he}} wanted to defend freedom of speech, which was Turkey's only hope for coming to terms with its history: [...] "What happened to the Ottoman Armenians in 1915 was a major thing that was hidden from the Turkish nation; it was a taboo.

[...] However, when Turkish television, CNN TURK asked Pamuk about his speech, he admitted that he said that [...] "Armenians were killed" [...] but he rejected that he said [...] "Turks killed Armenians" [...] and he estimated the number of deaths (as 1 million) in that speech.|$|E
2500|$|The Governor-General, Ronald Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar, was a stern imperialist who openly {{associated}} with the David Lloyd George government in England and was influential behind the scenes in pushing for conscription to aid the Empire's war effort. Realising the impasse, Munro Ferguson promised Hughes upon his return that he would sign a bill for conscription, and grant a double dissolution if the parliament could not pass it. However, Hughes quickly realised that the issue could destroy the party, especially if taken to a general election, {{and that there were}} few options except to take the question directly to the people. This route was advised by high court Justices Edmund Barton and Griffith. At least one close associate felt that the prospect of a referendum on the issue also appealed to Hughes self-perception of his popular status. [...] "Hughes reveled in his own success as a charismatic leader, and it appealed strongly to his romantic nature <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> directly with the people".|$|E
