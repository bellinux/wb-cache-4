5|$|According to the Mexican authorities, {{the murder}} plot was {{possibly}} {{carried out with}} the collaboration of the Tijuana Cartel because no security measures were taken during the party and because the entrances were {{open to the public}} (when they are usually closed for private events). The investigation was further {{complicated by the fact that}} many of the invitees—fearing for their lives—fled from the scene when Francisco Rafael was killed by the clown. Out of the 80 to 100 attendees, only 20 of them stayed, many of them family members and employees of the banquet hall. When the authorities interrogated those who stayed and asked them whether they had recognized the assassin or any other physical features, none of them were able to give any details. Some stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not even pay attention to the clown when he entered the crime scene, while others stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not even recall exactly what the clown was wearing, remembering only that the assassin was wearing a blue-stripped or purple shirt, a multicolored wig, and a red clown nose.|$|E

5|$|Dark Magus was {{released}} after Davis' 1975 retirement, upon which his label, Columbia Records, issued several albums of various outtakes. After issuing the live recordings Agharta (1975) and Pangaea (1976), Columbia decided <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> {{not approve of}} the albums, and Dark Magus {{was released}} only in Japan, in 1977 by CBS-Sony. The label's A executive Tatsu Nosaki suggested the album's title, which referred to the Magus from the Zoroastrian religion.|$|E
5|$|However, his {{policies}} {{led to the}} GTP's collapse in 1919. The company was placed in receivership, and the government seized GTR's stock.

That scheme was blamed for the company's collapse.|$|E

5|$|According to Voigt, the coven {{placed an}} {{emphasis}} on practical magic rather than worship, theology, ethics, or ritual, and were eclectic in their practices, mixing Huna with forms of American folk magic. She noted <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not worship a goddess but held to a belief in a god who was opposed to the God of Christianity. Moreover she claimed that they met together for both outdoor and indoor meetings, according to the phases of the moon. According to Voigt's account, Anderson also claimed that on occasion, the coven used a naked woman as their altar, and that the group disbanded after World War II broke out.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{discussion}} {{about how the}} episode should end, the writers decided <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not want Barney to return to being drunk {{at the end of}} the episode. Barney stayed sober for several seasons. The animators modified the appearance of the character, straightening his hair, among other things, to indicate his sobriety. Castellaneta altered his voice for the character by no longer slurring. Barney was still seen at Moe's Tavern, but only drinking lattes. The character's new addiction to coffee was suggested by writer-producer David Mirkin, who has friends who stopped drinking alcohol and became addicted to coffee.|$|E

However, there are non-human life forms such as evolutions of Earth species (e.g. the Cat race), robotic or holo-life forms created by humans, and a kind of 'Genetically Engineered Life Form' (GELF), an artificially-created creature. Simulants and GELFs frequently serve as antagonists among the later series of the show.|$|E
