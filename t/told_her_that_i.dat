[...] "I told Vicky that they wouldn’t come {{open the door and}} she told me to kick it open. I did. Upon entry, I found the bedroom door locked. I called the hotel operator and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> needed security to open the bedroom door. They refused again, and I told them that I’m going to damage the hotel room and (they) need to send security, call 911 and call an ambulance. I kicked the bedroom door 6-7 times before it somehow popped open. I went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened and I could see his feet." [...] Kirsten told police in a signed statement. Kirsten said that Vicky {{was on the phone with}} him the whole time asking for updates, [...] "She told me that she called the front desk and they hung up on her. It was a female. She called back a couple minutes later and a male answered, saying that it was (the first) that he was hearing about the incident." [...] Kirsten said in his statement that he loosened the band around Cornell's neck then tried to resuscitate him by compressing his chest. Medical personnel arrived at 12:56 a.m and tried to resuscitate the singer with no success. Cornell was pronounced dead at 1:30a.m., an hour and 15 minutes after his bodyguard was first contacted by Cornell's wife. It's unknown how long it took the bodyguard to gain entry to the hotel room and find Cornell.|$|E
60|$|Rectus couldn't; but I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{understood}} the language tolerably well, {{and asked her}} why she wished to know.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother {{took the}} oranges {{out of the}} knapsack, and then I pulled it up again. I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had plenty more for myself.|$|E
60|$|When I {{returned}} to my palace <b>I</b> found <b>that</b> the rumor already had reached Dejah Thoris, so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had heard.|$|R
60|$|I {{found my}} voice and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> truly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>her</b> {{beautiful}} beyond my dreams of angels--as indeed she was. Whereat she smiled as one well pleased.|$|R
6000|$|... "I obeyed orders," [...] Dredlinton told him. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> ladyship <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{should be}} home to dinner and {{probably}} bring some friends. I was a little late but she waited." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{called to}} Euphemia and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{had found the}} old tavern sign. She came to look at it, and I pulled it out.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{loved you}} {{in spite of}} myself, and would make you my wife {{in the face of}} all opposition. Now, Jean, your answer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is {{not expecting}} me, as it happens," [...] Draconmeyer lied smoothly. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might be dining at the Villa Mimosa. I {{have to be}} there later on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told your}} mother," [...] he continued, [...] "all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have told you, and more. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> dear, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cared for you, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted you to}} be my wife." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{said she}} would come with me. She felt the change would do her good, and promised not to do {{anything}} when she got there. And then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had done for Dick.|$|R
60|$|I was {{a little}} puzzled, but at all events <b>I</b> {{understood}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might now take my leave. When I shook hands with Mrs. Strickland <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> could be of any use to her I should be very glad. She smiled wanly.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I persisted; I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> greatly desired {{that she}} should speak a few {{sentences}} in Burmese into my instrument. I had a certain reason for this which I would explain afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think so}} too," [...] Mr. Armstrong agreed; [...] "and now {{let us go}} in. I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should speak to you this evening, and she must be waiting anxiously for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right," [...] Mary assured him, laughing. [...] "It {{was one of}} the first things she mentioned. When I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should ask any one to tea I liked she was {{positively}} indignant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She writes me word to {{say that}} she has <b>told</b> all <b>her</b> friends <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am engaged to her, and kindly presses me to make good her assurances by {{becoming}} so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> at once <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought nothing of the kind!" [...] exclaimed Allan, indignantly. [...] "Why did you leave her a moment in doubt about it?" ...|$|R
60|$|I couldn't kill her--not {{at least}} until the last moment; and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> so, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> loved <b>her,</b> and <b>that</b> until death came, I would live and fight for her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{would be}} the last person to wish to tempt her to selfishness, but that I did not think that either could be easy in {{settling}} such a matter through a third person." ...|$|E
6000|$|Fanny's good-humoured face cleared up. 'Yes, ma'am, I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was quite}} sure that Miss Gillian would not go for to do {{anything}} wrong, {{and that it could}} be easy explained; but people has tongues, you see.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My sister," [...] she answered. [...] "It {{was to try}} {{and save}} her life that I wanted the money. When I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not get it, she gave up and died. Your uncle killed her. Come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This was {{the ruined}} cathedral, {{built at the}} time when the entire {{population}} was converted, and it was a large order; but I was afire with love, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> the church <b>I</b> would build would be even bigger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, {{as there}} was no help for it, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> everything, except <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{did not mention the}} Water-devil in {{connection}} with our marvellous stoppage. <b>I</b> only said <b>that</b> that was caused by something which nobody understood.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you asked}} me to stand for the place I had not heard that he thought of being a candidate. I wrote and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> so, and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> also <b>that</b> had <b>I</b> known it before I would not have come here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{would see}} after the breakfast in future, father, and I have begun this morning--partly {{because it is}} my duty to take the work off her hands, and partly because I wanted a private talk with Sir Cyril." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What Mary says is not true. She did {{not think}} that I was going to bind myself closer with them, as she calls it. I have been quite open with her, and have always <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not be Arthur Fletcher's wife." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{would not}} bid her goodby; I should find {{a moment to}} come back the next morning. Her cousin, who had put on his sombrero again, flourished it off at me {{by way of a}} bow, upon which I took my departure.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{at first}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{could not see}} her, and begged her not {{to speak to me}} about it. I tried to make <b>her</b> {{understand}} <b>that</b> she should go to some one else. But it was of no use." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, dear; {{but first}} I must tell your friend that some tradesmen have been robbed {{by a person}} so {{strongly}} resembling you that she deceived even those that knew you well. The matter was so serious {{that we have had}} a number of detectives searching for this woman, as only by her being found could we prove that the orders for these goods were not given by you. Having <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> much <b>I</b> can go on with my news.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I suppose not; and I'm sure I shouldn't {{have asked}} you, because I think it isn't the thing, {{dragging}} people away {{out of their}} own parishes, here and there, to anybody's church. And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> though <b>I</b> would of course go and hear Mr. Prong now and then if she married him, I wouldn't leave Mr. Comfort, not as a regular thing. But she didn't seem to mind that now, much as she used always to be saying about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{would be}} her brother, and {{that as long as}} I had a {{shilling}} she should never want sixpence. And I mean it. And as for what you say about romance and repenting it, that simply comes from your being a lawyer." ...|$|E
60|$|I laughed, and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought I knew {{somebody}} who dressed much finer even than Miss Putney, and then I described the incident of the Duke's dressing-gown. This delighted them all, and before I left I {{was obliged to}} give every detail of my gorgeous attire.|$|E
60|$|In {{the second}} place, I am under no {{obligation}} to Mr. Gracedieu's daughter which forbids me to make use of her portfolio. I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> only consented to receive it, under reserve of my own right of action--and her assent to that stipulation was expressed in the clearest terms.|$|E
6000|$|The Earl sighed deeply. 'Lima is her destiny. Her {{mother is}} bent on it, {{and says that}} she wishes it herself; but on one thing I am resolved: she shall not go alone! <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> mother <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will go with her, and not leave her without seeing what kind of home that man has for her. Mary--the mother, I mean--persists in declaring that he has real affection for his child, and <b>that</b> <b>her</b> {{presence}} will save him.' ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the water}} failed to restore her, and my anxiety deepened as <b>I</b> gazed on <b>that</b> white, still face. Oh, why had <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> sad tragedy <b>I</b> had {{imagined}} {{with so little}} preparation? Alas! I had succeeded too well in my purpose, killing her vain hope and her at the same moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, I {{want you}} to give me this chance to get on my feet again. You've no right to deprive me of it; it's unchristian. In our {{dealings}} with each other we should be guided by the Golden Rule, as I was saying to Mrs. Lapham before you came in. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> knew myself, I should in your place consider the circumstances of a man in mine, who had honourably endeavoured to discharge his obligations to me, and had patiently borne my undeserved suspicions. <b>I</b> should consider <b>that</b> man's family, <b>I</b> told Mrs. Lapham." ...|$|R
