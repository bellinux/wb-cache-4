5|$|In 1892 Piłsudski {{returned}} from exile {{and settled in}} Adomavas Manor near Teneniai (now in Šilalė district). In 1893 he joined the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) and helped organize its Lithuanian branch. Initially he sided with the Socialists' more radical wing, but despite the socialist movement's ostensible internationalism he remained a Polish nationalist. In 1894, as its chief editor, he began publishing an underground socialist newspaper, Robotnik (The Worker); he would also be one of its chief writers, and, initially, a typesetter. In 1895 he became a PPS leader, and took the position that doctrinal issues were of minor importance and that socialist ideology should be merged with nationalist ideology, since <b>that</b> <b>combination</b> offered the greatest chance of restoring Polish independence.|$|E

40|$|Resource {{diversity}} {{is critical to}} fitness in many insect species, and may determine the coexistence of competitive species and the function of ecosystems. Plant material provides the nutritional base for numerous aquatic systems, yet the consequences of diversity of plant material have not been studied in aquatic container systems important {{for the production of}} mosquitoes. To address how diversity in leaf detritus affects container-inhabiting mosquitoes, we examined how leaf species affect competition between two container inhabiting mosquito larvae, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, that co-occur {{in many parts of the}} world. We tested the hypotheses that leaf species changes the outcome of intra- and interspecific competition between these mosquito species, and <b>that</b> <b>combinations</b> of leaf species affect competition in a manner not predictable based upon the response to each leaf species alone (i. e. the response to leaf combinations is non-additive). We find support for our first hypothesis that leaf species can affect competition, evidence that, in general, leaf combination alters competitive interactions, and no support <b>that</b> leaf <b>combination</b> impacts interspecific competition differently than intraspecific competition. We conclude <b>that</b> <b>combinations</b> of leaves increase mosquito production non-additively such <b>that</b> <b>combinations</b> of leaves act synergistically, in general, and result in higher total yield of adult mosquitoes in most cases, although certain leaf combinations for A. albopictus are antagonistic. We also conclude that leaf diversity does not have a different effect on interspecific competition between A. aegypti and A. albopictus, relative to intraspecific competition for each mosquito...|$|R

In October 2012 a study reported that combining Dabrafenib with a MEK inhibitor trametinib led to even better outcomes.

25|$|While Plex {{can access}} media {{recorded}} via digital video recorders (DVR), {{it does not}} support recording the content itself. DVRs are only in charge of recording live TV content from cable television for cable DOCIS companies and/or IPTV for xDSL companies. Depending on the services provided by the DVRs, Plex could access the content. Still depending on the offered features, DVRs can also stream content without recording it on a hard disk drive. Tablo (DVR)s are reported to work fine with Plex, because two tablo users, developed a Plex Channel (see Plugins below) to watch content recorded by Tablo DVRs and even watch the TV, as Tablo does support Live TV streaming. Thanks to <b>that</b> <b>combination</b> of Plex and Tablo, {{it is now possible}} to watch over-the-air (OTA streaming).|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{it would}} be quite {{difficult}} to physiologically measure an individual's three cone responses to various physical color stimuli. Instead, a psychophysical approach is taken. Three specific benchmark test lights are typically used; let us call them S, M, and L. To calibrate human perceptual space, scientists allowed human subjects to try to match any physical color by turning dials to create specific combinations of intensities (I'S, I'M, I'L) for the S, M, and L lights, resp., until a match was found. This needed only to be done for physical colors that are spectral, since a linear combination of spectral colors will be matched by the same linear combination of their (I'S, I'M, I'L) matches. Note that in practice, often at least one of S, M, L would have to be added with some intensity to the physical test color, and <b>that</b> <b>combination</b> matched by a linear combination of the remaining 2 lights. Across different individuals (without color blindness), the matchings turned out to be nearly identical.|$|E

Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get <b>that</b> <b>combination</b> of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
25|$|Their white jerseys have {{provided}} three basic color combinations, {{two of which}} have been previously alluded to in this article. The last combination consists of both white jerseys and pants. That particular combination surfaced in {{the first game of the}} 2003 season, when the team was coached by Steve Spurrier, during a nationally televised game against the New York Jets, which led many sports fans and Redskins faithful alike to point out that they had never seen that particular combination before. That year the Redskins wore it two more times. That look didn't appear again until midway through the 2005 season when the Redskins wore it in a road game against the St. Louis Rams. The Redskins won six straight games, including one in the playoffs against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, wearing <b>that</b> <b>combination</b> and the local media jokingly pointed out that the reason the Redskins were winning was their use of the white over white combination. In the NFC Divisional Playoff game against the eventual 2005 NFC Champion Seattle Seahawks, the Redskins wore the all-white uniforms, in hopes that they could keep their streak going; however, they lost 20–10. The Redskins continued to wear the white jerseys and white pants into the 2006 preseason. In the 2006 season, the Redskins started wearing black cleats, something that hadn't been done for quite a while. It was a surprise because they wore white cleats during the preseason. They would have to wear that color for the rest of the season, because the NFL usually asks teams to choose either black or white cleats to be worn throughout the season.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002, Greg Kot {{admired the}} song, saying: [...] "once again, a raga-flavored groove brings out Harrison's {{best in the}} walloping 'It's All Too Much.'" [...] That same year, Nigel Williamson of Uncut {{described}} it as [...] "a psychedelic classic" [...] that, had it been recorded earlier in 1967, [...] "would have made Sgt Pepper an even better album". In the fourth edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Rob Sheffield wrote: [...] "Yellow Submarine was a flat soundtrack rather than a real album, but here's a question: Why is George's 'It's All Too Much' not heralded {{as one of the}} top five all-time psychedelic freakouts in rock history?" [...] Sheffield features the track in his 2017 book Dreaming the Beatles, where he refers to it as [...] "the great lost Beatle song – the one that deserves to be infinitely more famous than it is", adding: [...] "It's where they really nailed the Sgt. Pepper sound – <b>that</b> <b>combination</b> of acid-rock momentum and brass-band frippery. 'It's All Too Much' would have been the second or third best song on Sgt. Pepper ..." [...] Richie Unterberger of AllMusic similarly considers Yellow Submarine to be [...] "inessential" [...] and describes the track as [...] "the jewel of the new songs... resplendent in swirling , larger-than-life percussion, and tidal waves of feedback guitar" [...] and [...] "a virtuoso excursion into otherwise hazy psychedelia".|$|E

She works closely with friend and photographer Maria Mochnacz to develop the visual style of each album. Around the time of To Bring You My Love, for example, Harvey began experimenting with her image and adopting a theatrical aspect to her live performances. Her former fashion style, which consisted of simple black leggings, turtleneck sweaters and Doc Martens boots, was replaced by ballgowns, catsuits, wigs and excessive make-up. She also began using stage props like a Ziggy Stardust-style flashlight microphone. She denied the influence of drag, Kabuki or performance art on her new image, a look she affectionately dubbed [...] "Joan Crawford on acid" [...] in an interview with Spin in 1996, but admitted that [...] "it's <b>that</b> <b>combination</b> of being quite elegant and funny and revolting, all at the same time, that appeals to me. I actually find wearing make-up like that, sort of smeared around, as extremely beautiful. Maybe that's just my twisted sense of beauty." [...] However, she later told Dazed & Confused magazine, [...] "that was kind of a mask. It was much more of a mask than I've ever had. I was very lost as a person, at that point. I had no sense of self left at all", and has never repeated the overt theatricality of the To Bring You My Love tour.|$|E
