Being able to extract accurate distances {{is the first step}} towards developing a proposed 802. 11 local area positioning system. This thesis explores a number of different methods of using 802. 11 to capture physical distance separation between mobile stations. The first method of measuring distance, involves using 802. 11 round <b>trip</b> <b>signal</b> times.

Another method of using 802. 11 to measure distance involves using signal strength measurements and a client-server arrangement. Distances can be extracted by extrapolating through a range of signal strength measurements. Because signal strength is a measurement of power, its behavior is governed by the inverse-square law. If environmental variables, such as humidity and RF interference do not significantly change, a line graph of signal strength measurements versus distance can be used to determine positions under these constant conditions.

The line fault can be identified by collecting the operation performance of pilot impedance component at another side of the line.

The two-step search of MS protection needs small calculation time, and thus the tripping output works with minimum delay. When the CS protection has judgment failure, backup protection will operate.
