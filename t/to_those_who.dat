5|$|The {{population}} of 745,400 of the Iban people in Sarawak, based on 2014 statistics, {{makes it the}} largest ethnic group in the state. The Iban were, in the past, a society that paid particular attention to social status, especially <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> displayed martial prowess as well as <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> demonstrated expertise in various fields such as farming and oratory. Specific terms were used to refer <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> belonged to particular social strata, such as the raja berani (rich and the brave), orang mayuh (ordinary people), and ulun (slaves). Despite modern influences, Iban still observe many of their traditional rituals such as Gawai Antu (festival of the dead) and Gawai Dayak (Harvest Festival).|$|E

5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{a sacrament}} {{signifying}} the baptized person's union with Christ, or {{becoming part of}} Christ and being treated {{as if they had}} done everything Christ had. Sacraments, along with preaching of God's word, are means of grace through which God offers Christ to people. Sacraments are believed to have their effect through the Holy Spirit, but these effects are only believed to be beneficial <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have faith in Christ.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{the sacrament}} of {{initiation}} into the visible church, or body of people who publicly claim faith in Christ. Baptism also signifies regeneration and remission of sin. Reformed Christians believe that the children of those who express faith in Christ should be baptized. Because baptism {{is believed to be}} beneficial only <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have faith in Christ, infants are baptized {{on the basis of the}} promise of faith which will come to fruition later in life.|$|E
5|$|In the Second World War, Great Britain granted conscientious-objection status {{not just}} to {{complete}} pacifists, but <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> objected to fighting in that particular war; this was done partly out of genuine respect, but also to avoid the disgraceful and futile persecutions of conscientious objectors {{that occurred during the}} First World War.|$|E
