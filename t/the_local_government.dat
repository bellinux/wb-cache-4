40|$|Urbanization is {{currently}} a global phenomenon, which has come with the dire need of providing and improving basic infrastructures. <b>Local</b> <b>governments</b> have also been charged with the acceleration of economic development in their municipalities. This has however, generated serious debate on the preparedness of <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> in accomplishing this goal, considering the level of financial impropriety often leveled against them. To what extent therefore can <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> manage our cities? This study proposes a capital market option {{as an alternative to}} check the financial impropriety of local councils and as a mechanism for involving the private sector in the efficient delivery of urban infrastructure in Nigeria. This paper is essentially of the view that <b>the</b> Nigerian <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> can manage <b>the</b> urban cities in Nigeria efficiently, if they adopt a market approach, by using the capital market sources of funding and not limiting themselves to statutory revenue allocations. It was also noted that there is enough infrastructure in place, to enable <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> to access <b>the</b> capital market financing. However for this to be successful, further amendments are needed in the Nigerian constitution, to secure the fiscal autonomy of <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> as contained in the 1989 federal Constitution.
