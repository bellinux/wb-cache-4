5|$|Dearly Stars sold 30,786 {{copies in}} its first week of release in Japan, and ranked as the tenth best-selling video game in Japan that week. The game {{received}} a score of 30 out of 40 from the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu. Critics have described Dearly Stars as suitable for beginners to the Idolmaster series for drawing out the series' essence and reorganizing it into a simpler and easier-to-understand form. At the same time, Famitsu reviewer Sekai Sandai Miyokawa thinks that fans of the series will feel from Dearly Stars {{the growth of the}} 765 Pro idols and the overall growth of the series. Reviewers note that despite the change in the game's details compared to previous games in the series, such as the change in perspective from the producer to the idol, Dearly Stars still plays like an Idolmaster game. However, another Famitsu reviewer stated that because other aspects of the gameplay in Dearly Stars are similar to previous Idolmaster games such as doing lessons and auditions, the sense of enjoyment is not <b>that</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> other games. A reviewer for Famitsu felt it was easier to empathize with an idol when the story was told from their perspective.|$|E

25|$|The final {{idea that}} was {{modified}} {{in modern times}} was the concept of Bushido. Bushido was the warrior code and laws of feudal Japan, that while having cultural surface differences, was at its heart not <b>that</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the code of chivalry or any other similar system in other cultures. In later years, the code of Bushido found a resurgence in belief following the Meiji Restoration. At first, this allowed Japan to field what {{was considered one of}} the most professional and humane militaries in the world, one respected by friend and foe alike. Eventually, however, this belief would become a combination of propaganda and fanaticism that would lead to the Second Sino-Japanese War of the 1930s and World War II.|$|E

500|$|The {{dispute over}} the {{authenticity}} of the biblical edicts has prompted interest in this passage from the Cyrus Cylinder, specifically concerning the question of whether it indicates that Cyrus had a general policy of repatriating subject peoples and restoring their sanctuaries. The text of the Cylinder is very specific, listing places in Mesopotamia and the neighboring regions. It does not describe any general release or return of exiled communities but focuses on the return of Babylonian deities to their own home cities. It emphasises the re-establishment of local religious norms, reversing the alleged neglect of Nabonidus – a theme that Amélie Kuhrt describes as [...] "a literary device used to underline the piety of Cyrus as opposed to the blasphemy of Nabonidus." [...] She suggests that Cyrus had simply adopted a policy used by earlier Assyrian rulers of giving privileges to cities in key strategic or politically sensitive regions {{and that there was no}} general policy as such. Lester L. Grabbe, a historian of early Judaism, has written that [...] "the religious policy of the Persians was not <b>that</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the basic practice of the Assyrians and Babylonians before them" [...] in tolerating – but not promoting – local cults, other than their own gods.|$|E

The kids of Baghdad High also open us up to a very different sense of life in Iraq than what we've been seeing on the nightly news for five years." [...] The Huffington Post said, [...] "previously it had been unfathomable that students in Baghdad might be experiencing the same ephemeral and narcissistic heartbreak as we are in the United States." [...] Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, [...] "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will seem instantly familiar to anyone who has spent time around a teenage boy. They like to wrestle each other, love Western music, dream big and have trouble buckling down in school." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 June {{the judge}} began his summing-up. He drew the jury's {{attention}} to the previous good character of the defendants, whom he characterised as [...] "men of hitherto unblemished reputation." [...] Cantley described Thorpe as [...] "a national figure with a very distinguished public record". The judge was scathing about the principal witnesses: Bessell was a [...] "humbug" [...] whose contract with The Sunday Telegraph was [...] "deplorable"; Scott was a fraud, a sponger, a whiner, a parasite—"but of course he could still be telling the truth. It {{is a question of}} belief." [...] Newton was characterised as a perjurer and a chump, [...] "determined to milk the case as hard as he can." [...] The mystery surrounding the £20,000 that Thorpe had obtained from Hayward was dismissed as an irrelevance: [...] "The fact that a man obtains money by deceit does not [...] that the man {{was a member of a}} conspiracy." [...] Waugh felt that the judge's lack of even-handedness could well provoke a counteraction against the accused from the jury. The summing-up became the subject of a scathing parody by the satirist Peter Cook, written and delivered shortly after the trial at The Secret Policeman's Ball in aid of Amnesty International. Cook's version, according to Freeman and Penrose, was [...] "actually not <b>that</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the original." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{simplest}} reflexes may be mediated by circuits lying entirely within the spinal cord, more complex responses rely on signal processing in the brain. For example, when {{an object in}} {{the periphery of the}} visual field moves, and a person looks toward it many stages of signal processing are initiated. [...] The initial sensory response, in the retina of the eye, and the final motor response, in the oculomotor nuclei of the brain stem, are not all <b>that</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those in a simple reflex, but the intermediate stages are completely different. [...] Instead of a one or two step chain of processing, the visual signals pass through perhaps a dozen stages of integration, involving the thalamus, cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, superior colliculus, cerebellum, and several brainstem nuclei. [...] These areas perform signal-processing functions that include feature detection, perceptual analysis, memory recall, decision-making, and motor planning.|$|E

2500|$|This {{began to}} change when Muslim women {{realized}} they could alter their roles in society by rereading the main religious texts that dictated Muslim society and ethics. [...] This return to reinterpretation was not a new practice – male Islamic scholars had been doing it ever since Muhammad's death – but for women, it was unprecedented: {{this was the first}} time that women were learning how to read and study the Qur'an and the hadiths in an analytical way. [...] Their new religious knowledge led them to a better understanding of their faith, as well as the ability to make educated interpretations of the texts. [...] Many of these Islamic feminist scholars began to realize that there was no inherent tie between Islam and the patriarchal practices of Islamic society. [...] For example, these feminists studied Muhammad's life and argued that he treated women very progressively for that era. [...] Muhammad included all of his wives in his religious practices and respected them enough to take their advice and grievances seriously. [...] They also even accompanied him to battle. According to Muslim feminists, Islamic polygyny was meant to curtail the practice that was already widespread in pre-Islamic times. [...] Conquering rulers would collect massive harems of women and treat them without any respect; whereas Islam reduced the allowable amount of wives each husband could have and required that he treat them all equally. These feminists place emphasis on the idea that only those men who are capable of loving and financially providing for each wife equally are permitted to have more than one. [...] They also point out the practice of polygyny in Islam was created for the purpose of taking care of fatherless children, or orphans. Thus, polygyny was allowable for charitable and honorable purposes. [...] Islamic feminists point out that [...] "a recognition that gender inequality in the old world was assumed and that perceptions of women in Christian and Jewish texts are not <b>that</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those of Islamic texts" [...] is lacking from common understandings of Islam.|$|E
