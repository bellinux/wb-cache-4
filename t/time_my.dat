In one of his lectures, often termed as [...] "Linji's Four Shouts" [...] he distinguished four different categories of katsu: The Master said to a monk, [...] "At <b>times</b> <b>my</b> shout is like the precious sword of the Diamond King. At <b>times</b> <b>my</b> shout is like a golden-haired lion crouching on the ground. At <b>times</b> <b>my</b> shout is like the search pole and the shadow grass.

Her lyrical content originally incorporated themes of rebellion and teenage romance; Andrew Unterberger from Popdust opined that [...] "17" [...] plays the girl-gone-wild tale as a near-horror story, clearly meant to shock and upset", while noting that [...] "One" [...] "instead features a robo'd out Sky bemoaning the breakdown of connection in a relationship, and her own inability to feel anything as a result." [...] As her career progressed, Ferreira more frequently experimented with elements of indie rock, which were commonly heard in her first album Night <b>Time,</b> <b>My</b> Time.|$|E
