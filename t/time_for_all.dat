5|$|In {{the uniform}} cost model (suitable for {{analyzing}} {{the complexity of}} gcd calculation on numbers that fit into a single machine word), {{each step of the}} algorithm takes constant time, and Lamé's analysis implies that the total running time is also O(h). However, in a model of computation suitable for computation with larger numbers, the computational expense of a single remainder computation in the algorithm can be as large as O(h2). In this case the total <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> of the steps of the algorithm can be analyzed using a telescoping series, showing that it is also O(h2). Modern algorithmic techniques based on the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm for fast integer multiplication can be used to speed this up, leading to quasilinear algorithms for the GCD.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan from}} 1995 {{involved}} two intermediate stations, at Vevelstad and Kolbotn. The plans also suggested building {{the line in}} two phases, first between Ski and Kolbotn, and then from Kolbotn to Oslo. In 2008, the National Rail Administration announced two possible plans for the right-of-way—both predominantly in tunnel. The one proposal included Kolbotn, the other did not. Both excluded Vevelstad as a station on the new line, since the station could not develop as a hub, and would still keep services along the existing commuter line. A report from Det Norske Veritas published in 2008, and ordered by the Rail Administration, concluded that neither a station at Vevelstad or at Kolbotn could support the extra cost of construction. A direct line with no intermediate stops is estimated to cost NOK 11 billion, while a line via Kolbotn would cost 13.5 billion. The report also argued that the intermediate stops would decrease capacity and increase travel <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> passengers departing south of Ski and traveling north. The exclusion of Kolbotn would also increase the importance of Ski as a regional public transport hub. In 2009, the Rail Administration abandoned the plans to build the line via Kolbotn, stating {{that it was more}} important to secure a fast connection to Ski. At the same time, they promised to upgrade the existing station at Kolbotn.|$|E
5|$|In May 1955, Edwards was {{selected}} for the England squad which travelled to mainland Europe for matches against France, Portugal and Spain, starting all three matches. Upon returning from the tour, he began a two-year stint in the British Army with the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. Army service was compulsory at the <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> men of his age under the National Service scheme. He was stationed at Nesscliffe near Shrewsbury along with team-mate Bobby Charlton, but was allowed leave to play for United. He also took part in army matches, and in one season played nearly one hundred matches in total. In the 1955–56 season, despite missing nearly two months of action due to a severe bout of influenza, Edwards played 33 times as United won the championship of the Football League {{by a margin of}} 11 points from Blackpool. The following season, he made 34 league appearances, taking his total past the 100 mark, as United won a second consecutive league title, and was also in the team that contested the 1957 FA Cup Final, in which United missed out on the Double after a 2–1 defeat to Aston Villa. He also made seven appearances during United's first ever foray into the European Cup, including a 10–0 win over Anderlecht which remains the club's biggest ever margin of victory. By now he was also a regular in the England team, featuring in all four of England's qualifying matches for the 1958 World Cup and scoring two goals in the 5–2 win over Denmark on 5 December 1956. He was expected to be a key player for England in the World Cup finals, and was seen as a likely candidate to replace the veteran Billy Wright as national team captain.|$|E

25|$|In 1871, Rome {{constructed}} a water tank on Neely Hill, which overlooks the downtown district. This later was adapted as a clock tower visible from many {{points in the}} city. It {{has served as the}} town's iconic landmark ever since, and is featured in the city's crest and local business logos. As a result, Neely Hill is also referred to as Tower or Clock Tower Hill. In this period the city established its first public schools, authorized by the state legislature in 1868 for the first <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> children, with some designated funding. Schools were segregated and tended to have short sessions limited by funding. Freedmen had the power to vote under new amendments to the US Constitution, affecting local politics.

At this time the running <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the programs was roughly sixty minutes. The cast members were veterans of the New York stage, film and advertising worlds and after auditioning for their parts came together for a rehearsal and then a day of recording the show. Sound effects were created by effects man Arthur Miller in the studio as the lines were being recorded and narration was done {{at the same time}} as well. All the elements were mixed live and by the end of the recording session the program was nearly finished, very similar to the live recordings from the great days of radio.|$|E
30|$|Wardrop's {{theory was}} based on two major principles. The first one was stating that travel times between the same origin and {{destination}} pairs for any used routes are {{less than or equal}} to the travel <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> unused routes. This is referenced as Dynamic User Equilibrium (DUE) in the literature and used for large-scale networks. Diverting traffic with DUE is inefficient and difficult-to-implement system optimum (i.e., min. average travel time) [14]. The second one aims at minimizing both the total travel times and average travel <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> assigned routes <b>for</b> <b>all</b> drivers on the whole network. However, individual choice of drivers was by no means guaranteed to satisfy this principle and in most cases did not [13].|$|R

25|$|Since {{literacy}} and personal incomes are both very low, radio {{is the most}} important medium of public communication. The government-owned Radio Voix du Sahel transmits 14 hours per day, providing news and other programs in French and several local languages. There are several private radio stations, including Radio France International, Africa Number One, Radio et Musique, Radio Souda, Radio Tenere, Radio Anfani, and Radio Tambara; the last five are owned locally and feature popular news programs in local languages, including Djerma and Hausa. These private radio stations generally are less critical of government actions than are the private newspapers. Radio Anfani and Radio et Musique presented news coverage that has included a variety of points of view. The other private domestic radio stations are smaller and offer little domestic news programming. The government-operated multilingual national radio service provides equitable broadcasting <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> legal political parties during the year.|$|E
25|$|Ball's tenure saw City {{narrowly}} avoid relegation by finishing 20th in 1991–92 and 19th in 1992–93. In December 1992, {{part of the}} floodlights failed {{with just}} six minutes left in City's home FA Cup game against Swansea City. The Grecians were losing 2-1 at the time, and when the referee tried to restart the match with {{only half of the}} floodlights working, City fans invaded the pitch and sat in the goalmouth. Once they were removed, the match restarted once more, only for the floodlights to fail one minute later; after which the match was abandoned. City lost the rescheduled match 5-2. City again made the headlines at the end the 1992–93 season, this <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the wrong reasons. In the penultimate game of the season, City needed a win against Port Vale to avoid relegation. City were leading 1-0, but referee Bob Hamer awarded Port Vale a controversial penalty in stoppage time. The penalty was converted and, after the final whistle, City supporters invaded the pitch, the referee was knocked to the ground and one of the linesmen was assaulted. Manager Alan Ball also ran onto the pitch to remonstrate with Hamer and had to be pulled away by his backroom staff. The season did have a positive for City, as they completed a league double over rivals Plymouth Argyle.|$|E
