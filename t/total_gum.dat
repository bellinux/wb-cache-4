40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the present research was to develop productivity equations of gum karaya (tartar gum) from Sterculia spp. as related to measurable growth parameters (height, diameter and crown height). The total area {{for this study was}} 75 hectare representing three locations each covering 25 hectare (500 m x 500 m). In each site, 50 sample plots were randomly chosen using random tables and GPS. The closest three trees to the centre of the each sample plot were selected for tapping by using an axe. The targeted trees for tapping were 116 trees from ALmazlagan area, 141 and 135 trees from bottom and top of Gabal Alahmar, respectively. Diameter at breast height (dbh), tree height (h) and crown height (ch) were measured for each tree and 8 gum collections were carried out for the sample trees starting from October 2006 to May 2007. Gum from each tree was collected, weighed and recorded for each selected sample tree. The data were analyzed using excel (spread sheet), SAS and JMP programs. Linear regression was used between measurable parameters with monthly gum picking and <b>total</b> <b>gum</b> production. The results for the three locations showed that there were significant differences between measurable parameters and monthly gum picking and crown height. In site Π; {{there was a significant difference}} in monthly gum picking and <b>total</b> <b>gum</b> production between diameter at breast height and average tree height. A total of 84 equations were developed for the three locations. The most important equations were relationships between height and diameter at breast height, crown height and diameter at breast height and crown height and height. The most important equations relating gum production and measurable parameters were relationships between total vi production and diameter at breast height, total production and crown height and total production and height The study showed that the maximum gum production is on the mountain top followed by the mountain bottom with the least production in the plateau.

40|$|Semi-PreParative gel {{permeation}} chromatography (gpc) {{was used}} to isolate several molecular mass components of gum arabic. The u. v. (218 nm) gpc elution profile showed the presence of several prominent peaks; however, only one major peak (FAw 3. 8 x 10 - 9 g moll) and a minor peak (FAw 1. 45 x 106 g mol- 1) were observed in the differential refractive index (R.

40|$|Surface {{tension and}} {{refractive}} index of guar gum (GG) (up to 0. 97 % w/w) and tragacanth gum (TG) (up to 1. 41 % w/w) aqueous dispersions were determined for systems {{with only one}} and both gums (mixtures) (up to 1. 25 % w/w). Experimental determinations were carried out from 5 to 30 C for surface tension and from 10 C to 40 C for refractive index. For mixtures, the effect of polymer ratio (1 : 3, 1 : 1 and 3 : 1) was analyzed at different <b>total</b> <b>gum</b> concentration and temperature. GG showed lower surface activity and refractive index than TG at the same experimental condition. Models for the estimation of surface tension and refractive index as function of gum concentration and temperature were proposed and satisfactorily tested. Both physical and optical properties, in the tested gum concentration range, allowed the determination of different behaviour for both gums because of a critical aggregation concentration for TG dispersions while this phenomenon was not observed for GG.

40|$|AbstractAcacia gum is a {{branched}} complex polysaccharide {{whose main}} chain consists of 1, 3 -linked β-D-galactopyranosyl units. Acacia gum {{is defined as}} a heteropolysaccharide since it contains ∼ 2 % of a polypeptide. The major molecular fraction (F 1) accounting for ∼ 88 % of the <b>total</b> acacia <b>gum</b> mass is an arabinogalactan peptide with a weight-average molecular weight of 2. 86 × 105 g/mol. The molecular structure of F 1 is actually unknown. From small angle neutron scattering experiments in charge screening conditions, F 1 appeared to be a dispersion of two-dimensional structures with a radius of gyration of ∼ 6. 5 nm and an inner dense branched structure. Inverse Fourier transform of F 1 scattering form factor revealed a disk-like morphology with a diameter of ∼ 20 nm and a thickness below 2 nm. Ab initio calculations on the pair distance distribution function produced a porous oblate ellipsoid particle with a central intricated “network”. Both transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy confirm the thin disk model and structural dimensions. The model proposed is a breakthrough in the field of arabinogalactan-protein-type macromolecules. In particular, concerning the site of biosynthesis of these macromolecules, the structural dimensions found in this study would be in agreement with a phloem-mediated long-distance transport. In addition, the structure of F 1 could also explain the low viscosity of acacia gum solutions, and its ability to self-assemble and to interact with proteins...|$|R
5000|$|While {{acacia gum}} has been {{harvested}} in Arabia, Sudan, and West Asia since antiquity, sub-Saharan acacia gum {{has a long}} history as a prized export. The gum exported came from the band of acacia trees that once covered much of the Sahel region: the southern littoral of the Sahara Desert that runs from the Atlantic to the Red Sea. Today, the main populations of gum-producing Acacia species are harvested in Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Sudan, Eritrea, Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. Acacia senegal is tapped for gum by cutting holes in the bark, from which a product called kordofan or Senegal gum is exuded. Seyal gum, from Acacia seyal, the species more prevalent in East Africa, is collected from naturally occurring exudations on the bark. Traditionally harvested by seminomadic desert pastoralists {{in the course of their}} transhumance cycle, acacia gum remains a main export of several African nations, including Mauritania, Niger, Chad, and Sudan. The hardened exudations are collected in the middle of the rainy season (harvesting usually begins in July), and exported at the start of the dry season (November). <b>Total</b> world <b>gum</b> arabic exports are today (2008) estimated at 60,000 tonnes, having recovered from 1987-1989 and 2003-2005 crises caused by the destruction of trees by the desert locust.

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the carbohydrate that would be supplied to the colon for fermentation under physiological conditions. Colectomized rats were fed fiber-free diets or diets containing 5 % (wt/wt) gum arabic. Four (fucose, galactose, glucosamine, and galactosamine) of 11 analyzed sugars accounted for 77 % of the total sugar in ileal excreta from colectomized rats fed fiber-free diets. The three sugars in gum arabic, rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose, accounted for 84 % of the <b>total</b> sugars in <b>gum</b> arabic ileal excreta. Comparisons of the sugar compositions of the ileal excreta, the water-soluble fractions of the excreta, and three gel filtration fractions of the water-soluble material with those of the water-soluble fraction of rat mucosa, the acetone-soluble fraction of pancreas, and pancreatin suggested that the major source of endogenous carbohydrate is mucin. Gum arabic increased the daily excretion of the four mucin-derived sugars (fucose, galactose, glucosamine, and galactosamine) by the colectomized rats from 473 mumol per day to 634 mumol per day.

40|$|IATE Axe 2 : Structuration sous contraintes des agropolymères et réactivité des poudresThe {{interactions}} of b-lactoglobulin (BLG) with <b>total</b> Acacia <b>gum</b> (TAG) in presence of quercetin {{have been investigated}} in aqueous solutions at pH 4. 2 and 25 _C. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) {{has been used to}} determine the type and magnitude of the energies involved in the complexation process. Dynamic light scattering (DLS), electrophoretic mobility (mE), turbidity measurements (s), optical microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in total attenuated reflection mode (ATR-FTIR) were used as complementary methods to better understand the sum of complicated phenomena at the origin of thermodynamic behaviour. The first structuring stage was characterized by an exothermic signal and was mainly controlled by favourable enthalpy changes due to electrostatic interactions between biopolymers. The second structuring stage was largely endothermic and more entropy driven, probably due to the release of small counterions from the electrical double layer and hydrophobic contribution to the binding process, implying the release of water molecules. The population distribution of the different species in solution and their size were determined through DLS. Dispersion turbidity of particles markedly increased and reached a maximum at 0. 013 TAGQ:BLG molar ratio corresponding to the appearance of coacervates. Above TAGQ:BLG molar ratio of 0. 015, dispersions turbidity decreased, which might be due to an excess of negative charges onto particles as revealed by electrophoretic mobility measurements. FTIR experiments indicated that BLGeTAG interactions, in presence or in absence of quercetin, induced a change in the a-helical structure of BLG. The results also showed significant loss in b-sheets indicating a change in the environment of BLG hydrophobic amino acids and the formation of proteineflavonoid complexes stabilized by hydrophobic associations. The results presented in this study should provide information about thermodynamic mechanisms of TAGeBLG binding processes in presence of an antioxidant, quercetin and will facilitate the application of the formed supramolecular assemblies as functional ingredients in food and non food systems...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Different {{studies have}} {{assessed}} {{the influence of}} chewing gum to aid control of appetite and reduce food intake. Purpose: The aims {{of the present study}} were to evaluate the effects of chewing gum on satiety, food hedonics and snack intake and to explore the potential effects of the combination of Garciniacambogia, green coffee extract and l-carnitine on satiety, when administered in a gum format. Methods: This was a prospective study in which 57 subjects randomly received three kinds of treatments, in a crossover design: (1) active gum; (2) placebo gum; and (3) no gum. Food preferences and appetite sensations were evaluated by means of the Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire and visual analog scales. Results: There was a significant reduction in low-fat sweet snack intake with placebo gum and the active gum compared to no gum and a reduction in high-fat sweet snack intake with the active gum compared to placebo gum and no <b>gum.</b> <b>Total</b> caloric intake was only reduced in the active gum condition. Both the active and placebo gum conditions significantly reduced hunger and prospective food consumption and increased fullness compared to no gum and were associated with a reduced wanting for sweet food in the LFPQ, consistent in a reduction in the relative preference for sweet snacks versus savoury snacks. Conclusion: This study supports the notion that chewing gum containing nutraceutical products might aid in the control over snack intake and reduce hunger sensations...|$|R
40|$|Masticatory {{efficiency}} in individuals with extensive tooth loss {{has been widely}} discussed. However, {{little is known about}} jaw movement smoothness during chewing and the effect of differences in food bolus location on movement smoothness and masticatory efficiency. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether experimental differences in food bolus location (anterior versus posterior) had an effect on masticatory efficiency and jaw movement smoothness. Jaw movement smoothness was evaluated by measuring jerk-cost (calculated from acceleration) with an accelerometer that was attached to the skin of the mentum of 10 asymptomatic subjects, and acceleration was recorded during chewing on two-colour chewing gum, which was used to assessed masticatory efficiency. Chewing was performed under two conditions: posterior chewing (chewing on molars and premolars only) and anterior chewing (chewing on canine and first premolar teeth only). Jerk-cost and masticatory efficiency (calculated as the ratio of unmixed azure colour to the <b>total</b> area of <b>gum,</b> the unmixed fraction) were compared between anterior and posterior chewing with the Wilcoxon signed rank test (two-tailed). Subjects chewed significantly less efficiently during anterior chewing than during posterior chewing (P = 0 · 0051). There was no significant difference in jerk-cost between anterior and posterior conditions in the opening phase (P = 0 · 25), or closing phase (P = 0 · 42). This is the first characterisation of the effect of food bolus location on jaw movement smoothness at the same time as recording masticatory efficiency. The data suggest that anterior chewing decreases masticatory efficiency, but does not influence jerk-cost...|$|R

Primary data were collected through the use of structured questionnaire administered on 150 farmers, out of which 104 were retrieved and used for the study. The data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The result indicated that majority of the respondents (48. 08 %) were between the ages of 41 – 50 years and all the respondents had one form of education or the order with majority (44. 23 %) obtained either HND or Degree. Most of them (42. 3 %) and (38. 46 %) operated on small scale (1 - 5 ha) for gum arabic and the other tree crops respectively. Only 3. 85 % and 1. 92 % of the respondents operated on large scale (26 ha and above) for gum arabic and other tree crops respectively. Also, 63. 46 % of respondents practiced intercropping gum arabic with some other crops. The profitability analyses show that 2, 725, 000. 00 and 2, 263, 700. 00 were realised as <b>total</b> revenue from <b>gum</b> arabic and the other tree crops respectively.

40|$|Hashab (Acacia senegal) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tree species in northern Sudan as it is the Gum Arabic producing tree. The objective of this study is to investigate about the gum arabic yield on Dalanj locality, which lies south to the gum belt on the clay soil. This area extends up to the Upper Nile State. The vegetation of this area is very dense and dominated with different acacia species. The study is based on two types of data; namely social data collected through questionnaire, interviews with some farmers in addition to secondary data collected from different sources. The second type of data is collected through inventory work; basically through sampling techniques. This method relies upon random distribution of the trees in a specific area to be sampled and different tree species to be recorded. A number of randomly determined points were selected in the area to be sampled for trees. A total number of 100 trees were randomly selected. For each tree diameter at breast height (DBH), <b>total</b> height and <b>gum</b> yield were measured and recorded. The gum yield from each of the selected trees was recorded for three successive seasons. The results of the study showed that all the farmers depended on agricultural production but gum arabic is considered to be an additional source of income between the harvest time and plant time of the agricultural crops. The study also showed that there are some differences between the gum yield in the hashab plantations and natural stands; it was found that the plantations are covered with high-yielding strains of Acacia 5 senegal. The results also showed that the tree size (diameter) has no effect on the quantity of gum arabic in the study area on multi-stemmed trees but in the single trees it has some effect. There is no significant difference between gum yield per tree between trees growing on sandy soils and those growing on clay soils. The study area is densely covered with hashab trees but the gum production per tree is low, probably due to the acute competition between the trees. The gum production increases with the increase of the family members; individuals produce lower quantities of gum arabic. Compared to Northern Kordofan (the original belt of gum arabic) hashab trees in Southern Kordofan have higher yield. It is recommended to fix an encouraging minimum price for gum Arabic. It is also recommended to establish producers’ cooperatives and offer loans to the producers so as to encourage them. Good relationship between the FNC and the farmers in the study area through different extension channels are needed...|$|R
