5|$|Clindamycin may {{prolong the}} effects of neuromuscular-blocking drugs, such as succinylcholine and vecuronium. Its {{similarity}} to the mechanism of action of macrolides and chloramphenicol means {{they should not be}} given simultaneously, as <b>this</b> <b>causes</b> antagonism and possible cross-resistance.|$|E
5|$|If enough {{moisture}} exists, thunderstorms {{can form}} along sea breeze fronts that then can send out outflow boundaries. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> chaotic wind/pressure regimes if the steering flow is weak. Like all other surface features, sea breeze fronts lie inside troughs of low pressure.|$|E
5|$|According to Transport for London (TfL), {{the station}} is at {{capacity}} {{because of the large}} number of passengers leaving and entering the station, as well as the large numbers of passengers changing between lines. Currently, everyone who uses the station has to pass through the intermediate concourse {{at the bottom of the}} main escalators. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> congestion and delays.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{area of research}} concerned the Wigner effect. Under bombardment by neutrons, the carbon atoms in the graphite moderator can be knocked out of the graphite's crystalline structure. Over time, <b>this</b> <b>causes</b> the graphite to heat and swell. Investigation of the problem would take most of 1946 before a fix was found.|$|E
5|$|Another way enzyme {{malfunctions}} {{can cause}} disease comes from germline mutations in genes coding for DNA repair enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are {{less able to}} repair mutations in their genomes. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> a slow accumulation of mutations and results {{in the development of}} cancers. An example of such a hereditary cancer syndrome is xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes the development of skin cancers in response to even minimal exposure to ultraviolet light.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also binds to the hemeprotein myoglobin. It {{has a high}} {{affinity for}} myoglobin, about 60 times {{greater than that of}} oxygen. Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> reduced cardiac output and hypotension, which may result in brain ischemia. A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.|$|E

5|$|Caribbean sponges of {{the genus}} Aplysina suffer from Aplysina red band syndrome. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> Aplysina to develop one or more rust-colored bands, {{sometimes}} with adjacent bands of necrotic tissue. These lesions may completely encircle branches of the sponge. The disease appears to be contagious and impacts approximately 10 percent of A. cauliformis on Bahamian reefs. The rust-colored bands are caused by a cyanobacterium, but it is unknown whether this organism actually causes the disease.|$|E
5|$|Clouds {{intercept}} both {{heat from}} the sun and heat radiated from the Earth. Their effects are complex and vary in time, location, and altitude. Usually during the daytime the interception of sunlight predominates, giving a cooling effect; however, at night the re-radiation of heat to the Earth slows the Earth's heat loss, <b>this</b> <b>causes</b> storms and subsequent flood rains and flooding.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the members}} of a close binary system raises tides on the other through {{gravitational}} interaction. However the bulges can be slightly misaligned with respect to the direction of gravitational attraction. Thus the force of gravity produces a torque component on the bulge, resulting in the transfer of angular momentum (tidal acceleration). <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> the system to steadily evolve, although it can approach a stable equilibrium. The effect can be more complex in cases where the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the orbital plane.|$|E

5|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, and breathing, because the {{external}} hydrostatic pressure of the water provides support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion diuresis compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E
5|$|Late August, 1996– Hurricane Edouard {{produces}} strong swells to the coastline, causing two {{deaths from}} drowning. In addition, one computer model predicts the hurricane would strike near Atlantic City with winds of over 111mph (178km/h) on Labor Day. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> Cape May County officials to contemplate ordering an evacuation for the busiest tourist {{weekend of the}} year, though the order never occurs.|$|E
5|$|Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, {{also called}} Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head, {{is where the}} ball section of the femur in the hip joint deteriorates {{following}} interruption of the blood flow and is the same condition as in humans. In dogs, <b>this</b> <b>causes</b> lameness of the hind-legs, the thigh muscles to atrophy and pain in the joint. It usually occurs between 6–12 months of age and has been documented {{in a variety of}} other terrier breeds including the Border terrier, Lakeland terrier, and Wheaten terrier.|$|E

5|$|Locusts are the {{swarming}} {{phase of}} certain species of short-horned grasshoppers {{in the family}} Acrididae. Swarming behaviour {{is a response to}} overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> the grasshopper to change colour, feed more and breed faster. The transformation of a solitary individual into a swarming one is induced by several contacts per minute over a short period.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Homer {{starts to}} fear that Maggie could die from {{touching}} things unsafe to her when he hears this from a childproofing saleswoman. As a result, he starts his own childproofing crusade, selling cheap but safe and effective products and making Springfield safe for children. However, <b>this</b> <b>causes</b> the baby-injury-related business in Springfield to go in decline. Homer feels bad for making people such as pediatricians lose their jobs and thus he ends his childproofing career.|$|E
5|$|Most {{multiple}} sequence alignment methods try {{to minimize}} the number of insertions/deletions (gaps) and, as a consequence, produce compact alignments. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> several problems if the sequences to be aligned contain non-homologous regions, if gaps are informative in a phylogeny analysis. These problems are common in newly produced sequences that are poorly annotated and may contain frame-shifts, wrong domains or non-homologous spliced exons.|$|E

The lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.|$|E
