60|$|Shortly after, young Stephenson gained {{yet another}} {{promotion}} in being {{raised to the}} rank of brakesman, whose duty it was <b>to</b> <b>slacken</b> <b>the</b> engine when the full baskets of coal {{reached the top of the}} shaft. This was a more serious and responsible post than any he had yet filled, and one for which only the best and steadiest workmen were ever selected. His wages now amounted to a pound a week, a very large sum in those days for a skilled working-man.|$|R
50|$|Most {{performances}} of the work last between 35 and 40 minutes. Many conductors choose <b>to</b> <b>slacken</b> <b>the</b> speeds suggested by Sibelius's metronome markings, particularly in the fast part (allegro energico) of the first movement. Because of this, many versions of the symphony are about 38-40 minutes long (the publishers suggest the duration is 40 minutes). In Osmo Vänskä's recording of the work, released in 1997, the first movement is played at the metronome mark suggested by Sibelius and takes 9:42 (compared with the 10½-11½ minute duration of most other recordings).|$|R
60|$|Spike {{was delighted}} {{with the success of}} this scheme, of which he was assured by a single {{experiment}} in heaving. After getting the spars well planted at their heels, he even ordered <b>the</b> men <b>to</b> <b>slacken</b> <b>the</b> purchases a little, and found that he could actually relieve the brig from the strain, by causing the wreck to be supported altogether by these shores. This was a vast relief from the cares of the approaching night, and indeed alone prevented the necessity of the work's going on without interruption, or rest, until the end was obtained.|$|R
60|$|At {{the proper}} hour all hands were called, and {{detailed}} to their several posts on the tower, {{and about the}} rock. In order to give additional purchase or power in tightening the tackle, one of the blocks of stone was suspended {{at the end of}} the movable beam of the crane, which, by adding greatly to <b>the</b> weight, tended <b>to</b> <b>slacken</b> <b>the</b> guys or supporting-ropes in the direction to which the beam with the stone was pointed, and thereby enabled the men more easily to brace them one after another.|$|R

But, as he stumbled over dust-heaps, piles of wood, old baskets, outworn hats, forsaken boots, and all the rubbish of the waste land, the movement of the flying fans began <b>to</b> <b>slacken,</b> <b>the</b> wheels ran slowly down, and, with a great throb and creak, the whole engine ceased moving, as a heart stops beating.

60|$|His advent, {{like that}} of Orpheus in hades, seemed to soothe all unpropitious powers with a sudden spell. <b>The</b> Fire began <b>to</b> <b>slacken,</b> <b>the</b> kettles began <b>to</b> lull, the meat began to cook, the irons began to cool, the clothes began to behave, the spirits began to rise, and the collar was {{finished}} off with most triumphant success. John watched the change, and, though a lord of creation, abased himself to take compassion on the weaker vessel, and was seized with a great desire to lighten the homely tasks that tried her strength of body and soul.

5000|$|The {{earth and}} the water form one globe, {{surrounded}} on all sides by air.

50|$|There is some {{confusion}} in articles {{over how the}} focusing mechanism of the eye works. In the classic book, Eye and Brain by Gregory, for example, the lens {{is said to be}} suspended by a membrane, the 'zonula', which holds it under tension. The tension is released, by contraction of the ciliary muscle, to allow the lens to become more round, for close vision. This implies the ciliary muscle, which is outside the zonula, must be circumferential, contracting like a sphincter, <b>to</b> <b>slacken</b> <b>the</b> tension of the zonula pulling outwards on the lens. This is consistent with the fact that our eyes seem to be in the 'relaxed' state when focusing at infinity, and also explains why no amount of effort seems to enable a myopic person to see farther away.|$|R

5000|$|The Fusilier Battalion of the 6th Regiment {{was more}} fortunate.

General Letort who led the attacks was mortally wounded [...] and died two days later on 17 June. Historians such as Philip Haythornthwaite postulate that if Letort had been present at Waterloo on 18 June, he might have affected the great French cavalry charge, and perhaps the outcome of the battle.|$|R

40|$|AbstractFrom the {{commencement}} of CMOS scaling, the simple MOSFETs are {{not up to the}} performance due to the increased SCEs and leakage current. <b>To</b> <b>slacken</b> <b>the</b> SCEs and leakage currents, different types of structures i. e. Multi-Gate MOSFETs like DG, TG, FinFETs are introduced. Currently the Integrated Device Manufacturer (IDM), foundries and electronic design automation (EDA) companies grant more investments and emphasis on most promising Multi-Gate technology. In this, sensitivity of underlap length on DC and AC parameters like drain current, SS, transition frequency, delay, EDP etc. is studied for both the chosen devices i. e. DG MOSFET and FinFET. From our reported results, DG MOSFET is a good candidate for high current drivability whereas FinFET provides better immunity to leakage currents and hence improved delay, EDP over DG MOSFET. Furthermore, FinFET provides high value of transition frequency which indicates that it is faster than DG MOSFET...|$|R

5000|$|In early September, it was {{revealed}} that UEFA had agreed <b>to</b> <b>slacken</b> <b>the</b> terms of the restrictions placed on Manchester City ordering them to reduce their Champions League squad from 25 to 21 players. Standard rules applicable to all clubs involved in the Champions League were that they could field no more than 13 foreign players along with four [...] "club-trained" [...] and four [...] "association-trained" [...] players. But following pressure from the club and the player union FIFPro, which claimed that the governing body could be guilty of creating a restriction of movement for players that would be against EU law, UEFA had allowed Manchester City to reduce their total non-overseas quota to five to compensate them for reduced squad numbers. This meant that the club had to include only one player developed at their own academy in their squad, as opposed to four that other clubs had to include, the remaining four of the quota being from the easier to find [...] "association-trained" [...] category.|$|R

5000|$|Two {{accidents}} with terrible ensuing consequences {{took place}} in November 2010. The first occurred when a driver refused to make way to a [...] "flasher" [...] BMW and was attacked by passengers from an escort vehicle, who were the members of Telman Ismailov's AST security company. However the [...] "flasher" [...] was illegal since the passenger was not a civil servant. Russian authorities initially attempted <b>to</b> <b>slacken</b> <b>the</b> pace of case proceedings, but internet-society outcry forced Rashid Nurgaliyev to assist the investigation. The second incident was provoked by a “VIP-flasher” BMW that side-swiped a passing car while overtaking. Security staff from the “VIP” escort threatened the motorist from that car. Later on, it was {{found out that the}} “VIP” car was assigned to the Chairman of the Ingushetia Assembly, Makhmud Sakalov. Exclusively with assistance of the President of Ingushetia Yunus-bek Yevkurov, and due to “blue-bucket” internet appeal, proceedings began. Eventually it turned out that Sakalov's security staff used the car as an illegal “flasher-taxi” during his absence from Moscow.|$|R

Of strong liberal sentiment, Hobhouse had small sympathy with the general policy of the government of India during the opening of Lord Lytton's viceroyalty. The attitude to Afghanistan was especially repugnant. He served from 1875 to 1877 as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta. On the conclusion of his term of office in 1877 he was made a K.C.S.I., and returning to England soon engaged in party politics as a thoroughgoing opponent of the Afghan policy of the conservative government.|$|R
5000|$|Couch ordered Howard {{to march}} his {{division}} toward {{the right and}} possibly flank the Confederate defenses his other two divisions had failed to dislodge. However the terrain did not permit any force marching from Fredericksburg towards Marye's Heights to attack anywhere other than at the stone wall along its base. When Howard's men attacked they were crowded back to the left, meeting the same resistance and were repulsed. As other Union soldiers followed the II Corps in, Couch ordered his artillery {{to move into the}} field and blast the Confederates at close range. When his own artillery chief protested exposing the gun crews in this fashion, Couch stated that he agreed but it was necessary to slow the Confederate fire in some way. The cannon stopped about 150 yards from the stone wall and opened fire, but quickly lost most of their crews and did little <b>to</b> <b>slacken</b> <b>the</b> enemy fire. During this Couch moved slowly along his line of men, who were on the ground firing as best they could until nightfall.

60|$|As they {{approached}} the tractor the noise suddenly increased, and its wheels spun faster, grinding on the skids. One of the horses reared, swinging up the pole, which nearly threw its fellow; {{then there was a}} frantic thud of hoofs against the frame of the vehicle, and the team, swinging half around, threatened to overturn it into the swamp. Prescott plied the whip; the beasts plunged. One pair of wheels left the road, and the rig slanted alarmingly. A violent crash and jolt followed; Gertrude came near to being flung out of her seat; and they passed the tractor and sped across the graded stretch at a furious pace. Prescott was braced backward, his feet pressed hard against a bar, his lips tightly set, while Gertrude, shrinking from the disaster that seemed imminent, wondered how he swung the panic-stricken beasts clear of the worst holes. She gasped with relief when they had passed the muskeg, but the trail was still in a dangerous state, and Prescott turned the team upon the grass, where they galloped on while the wheels smashed through short scrub, until at last <b>the</b> speed began <b>to</b> <b>slacken.</b> <b>The</b> horses' coats were foul and flecked with spume when Gertrude looked backward and saw the tractor far away in the distance.|$|R
