Bomb-tritium data were used from the Transient Tracers in the Ocean (TTO) program in order to quantify the replenishment and overturning rates for deep water located in the North Atlantic. Bomb-tritium also enters the deep ocean around the Antarctic. Most of the bomb <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> (HTO) throughout the atmosphere can enter the ocean through the following processes: a) precipitation, b) vapor exchange, and c) river runoff – these processes make HTO a great tracer for time-scales up to a few decades.

40|$|Hydrogen is {{the most}} {{abundant}} chemical element in the universe and exists under three isotopic forms: protium, deuterium and tritium. Protium is commonly used {{in a variety of}} industries including electronics, metallurgy, chemistry and petrochemistry. Deuterium and tritium have taken more roles in both civil and defence nuclear industries and biomedical sciences. Today water treatment systems at nuclear sites remove many contaminating debris isotopes, with the exception of tritium. This is because <b>tritiated</b> <b>waters</b> have traditionally been particularly difficult and expensive to treat while they can spread easily if they escape into the environment. The topic of separation and purification of tritium and deuterium has a considerable value. Among the numerous separation methods of hydrogen isotopes, H 2 -H 2 O liquid catalytic exchange has attracted interest because of its mild operating conditions, high efficiency, limited corrosion and toxicity. The method of hydrogen-water liquid catalytic exchange has many possible applications such as; producing and upgrading heavy water, producing light water and removing tritium from light and heavy waters for recycling to fusion reactors or for low level nuclear deposits. This thesis presents the hydrogen-water isotope exchange reaction that is taking place co-currently and counter-currently through a trickle bed column. Numerical simulations were performed by process design and fluid flow modelling. The missing physical properties of deuterium, and particularly of tritium isotopologues in gaseous and water forms, were predicted and validated with existing literature data. Moreover, suitable operating parameters were approached allowing isotopic exchange to be performed under favourable performance. Intrinsic fluid flow studies by 3 D modelling offered more understanding of various underlying phenomena taking place at the local scale and provided identification of main hydrodynamic characteristics in a trickle bed reactor including trends of pressure drop, liquid holdup and catalyst wetting efficiency. The activity of the catalytic process in terms of rate of conversion was discussed through the effect of operating conditions and was validated by a comparison with experimental data and literature...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Health {{effects of}} tritium, a β-emitter and a {{by-product}} of the nuclear industry, is a subject of significant controversy. This mouse in vivo study was undertaken to monitor biological effects of low level tritium exposure. Mice were exposed to <b>tritiated</b> drinking <b>water</b> (HTO) at 10 KBq/L, 1 MBq/L and 20 MBq/L concentrations for one month. The treatment {{did not result in}} a significant increase of apoptosis in splenocytes. To examine if this low level tritium exposure alters radiosensitivity, the extracted splenocytes were challenged in vitro with 2 Gy γ-radiation, and apoptotic responses at 1 and 24 h were measured. No alterations in the radiosensitivity were detected in cells from mice exposed to tritium compared to sham-treated mice. In contrast, low dose γ-irradiation at 20 or 100 mGy, resulted in a significant increase in resistance to apoptotic cell death after 2 Gy irradiation; an indication of the radioadaptive response. Overall, our data suggest that low concentrations of tritium given to mice as HTO in drinking water do not exert cytotoxic effect in splenocytes, nor do they change cellular sensitivity to additional high dose γ-radiation. The latter may be considered as the lack of a radioadaptive response, typically observe...|$|R

The 29 -kiloton detonation took place 4, 240 feet below ground surface and was designed to evaluate the use of a nuclear detonation to enhance natural gas production from the Pictured Cliffs Formation in the San Juan Basin, Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, on land administered by Carson National Forest. A site-specific conceptual model was developed based on current understanding of the hydrologic and geologic environment. This conceptual model was used for establishing plausible contaminant exposure scenarios, which were then evaluated for human health risk potential.

40|$|The hydrogeology, {{stable isotope}} distribution, and {{chemical}} distribution of Cl- and NO 3 [...] N within the Battersea Drainage Basin in southern Alberta were investigated. The Battersea Drainage Basin {{is characterized by}} widespread spreading of livestock manure on irrigated farmland and a high density of feedlots, creating concern about groundwater quality in the region. Past research has used conventional piezometers to study the source, distribution and fate of nitrate in the shallow groundwater. The key component of this research involved using the new technique of high-resolution profiling to determine the distribution, source, fate, and transport of nitrate in the shallow geological groundwater environment. High-resolution profiles of δ 2 H indicated groundwater throughout the glaciofluvial deposits and between 5. 4 and 13. 7 m below ground in glaciolacustrine deposits contained values > - 150. 0 ‰ and <b>tritiated</b> <b>waters</b> (> 0. 08 TU). This suggested that this water recharged within the past 60 years. At depth 5. 4 to 13. 5 m BG, lower δ 2 H values did not coincide with detectable tritium, indicating the groundwater was much older and not vulnerable to agricultural contamination. High-resolution profiles of Cl- and NO 3 [...] N (solid core and squeezed pore water data) showed concentrations of these ions up to 411 and 219 mg L- 1, respectively, in the glaciofluvial deposits. Concentrations of Cl- and NO 3 [...] N decreased to less than 50 mg L- 1 (Cl-) and the Drinking Water Standard for NO 3 [...] N (10 mg L- 1) in the underlying glaciolacustrine and glacial till deposits at most sites. Comparison to the high-resolution δ 2 H profiles suggested the high nitrate concentration in the glaciofluvial sediments is agricultural in origin. High concentrations for Cl- and NO 3 [...] N (up to 257 and 209 mg L- 1, respectively) observed in glacial till and glaciolacustrine deposits below 6. 0 m BG at two sites (LB 5 a and LB 6) did not coincide with modern water, indicating the source of high nitrate is geologic in origin. The NO 3 [...] N to Cl- ratios suggested denitrification was not appreciable in the glaciofluvial deposits. However, denitrification may be a cause of decreased nitrate in the underlying fine textured deposits at certain sites. Interpretation of the high resolution profiles also suggested that the major conduit for nitrate migration is in near-surface glaciofluvial sediments via advection. The distributions of δ 2 H, Cl- and NO 3 [...] N with depth suggest that transport in the underlying glaciolacustrine and glacial till deposits is diffusion dominated, thus acting as a sink and removing nitrate from the permeable zone. However, the presence of fracturing in the oxidized zone of glacial tills and glaciolacustrine deposits suggests that transport may occur via advection through fracturing and diffusion in the material matrix. High-resolution profiling of δ 2 H, Cl- and NO 3 [...] N proved to be valuable in obtaining information regarding the distribution, source, and transport of groundwater and nitrate in the shallow groundwater environment {{at a level of}} detail that cannot be readily obtained through use of conventional piezometers...|$|R

40|$|Proceedings of the 2007 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 27 - 29, 2007, Athens, Georgia. Hydrodynamic {{dispersion}} is {{an important}} factor controlling contaminant migration in the subsurface environment. However, few comprehensive data sets exist for evaluating the impact of travel distance and site heterogeneity on solute dispersion under non-uniform flow conditions. In addition, anionic tracers are often used to estimate physical transport parameters based on an erroneous assumption of conservative (i. e., non-reactive) behavior. Therefore, a series of field experiments using <b>tritiated</b> (³H) <b>water</b> and other commonly used hydrologic tracers, bromide (Br) and fluorinate benzoic acid (FBA), were conducted to evaluate solute transport processes in a diverging axisymmetric flow field. Tracer migration was monitored using a set of six, multilevel sampling wells concentrically spaced at distances from 2. 0 to 4. 5 meters around the injection well. Soil hydraulic parameters for aquifer matrix were inversely optimized and an average longitudinal dispersivity for ³H breakthrough was estimated using numerical finite-element code (i. e., HYDRUS- 2 D) capable of describing an axisymmetric diverging flow. Tremendous variation in tracer arrival times between similar sampling locations and multiple arrival peaks observed for some sampling locations were observed for both, ³H and Br. Migration of the Br was retarded, when compared to that of the ³H, and analysis of the anion data assuming conservative behavior would thus yield higher dispersivity values than conservative tracer.

40|$|A new {{extraction}} procedure is applied here to radioim-munoassay of serum estradiol. Small columns packed with porous, grainy kieselguhr {{are loaded with}} the samples. The kieselguhr material acts as support for the water phase, from which the lipophilic compound estradiol is eluted with diethyl ether. With use of a specially constructed rack, several columns can be handled simultaneously, which makes the procedure convenient for routine use: 40 col-umns can be processed in about 30 mm, including appli-cation of samples, elution, and evaporation of solvent. The results correlate well (r = 0. 98) with those by conventional liquid-liquid extraction, and the new method has lower interassay coefficients of variation.

AddItionalKeyphrases: hormones #{ 149 }column extraction vs liquid-liquid extraction The value of determining 17 fl-estradiol in serum, alone or in combination with determination of other hormones, has been recognized for several years. Data on estradiol are im-portant in assessing disorders of the menstrual cycle or for monitoring induction of ovulation (1, 2). In early pregnancy, a low serum estradiol concentration is an indicator of threat-ened abortion (3, 4). Like other steroid hormones, estradiol is usually measured by radioimmunoassay after extraction or chromatographic purification from serum (5). A few years ago a new solid-phase extraction technique was developed for the assay of drugs in biological samples (6). Columns of porous, finely divided kieselguhr particles adsorb the serum or urine samples, acting as carrier for the water phase. When an organic solvent is passed through the columns, the lipophilic com-pounds are extracted and collected in the eluate, while the water-soluble compounds are retained in the columns. This principle was soon adapted for the extraction of hormones (7 - 9). I have applied this technique to serum estradiol de-termination...|$|R
