5|$|Dexter's girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz) comforts her upset co-worker, Yelina (Monique Curnen), and {{learns that}} Yelina's fiancé, who was immigrating from Cuba {{illegally}} {{with the help}} of a coyote, is missing. Rita asks Dexter to look into the problem using his police connections, and he finds a list of subjects from a past police case. He investigates Jorge Castillo, a salvage yard owner, and after Yelina's fiancé washes up dead on a beach, he discovers that Castillo is murdering the smuggled immigrants who cannot pay for their freedom. Dexter leads Castillo into a trailer in his salvage yard, but as he prepares to kill him, Castillo's wife Valerie (Valerie Dillman) arrives. Dexter realizes that the couple are working together, and decides to kill both Jorge and Valerie in the trailer. After killing them, he dumps <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>in</b> the ocean and frees their Cuban prisoners, not noticing the person watching him from the trunk of a car in the yard.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass is {{narrowly}} {{saved from}} discovery by the rioting construction workers, who storm {{the plant and}} along with him are besieged inside the gas distribution centre, where they pump oxygen into the completed pressure dome to poison the ammonids, however some of the workers succumb to propaganda from the plant controllers, who offer them {{the chance to see}} inside the dome. The guards kill them by blocking the pipe with <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b> <b>In</b> anger, the remaining workers fire on the dome with a bazooka, igniting the hydrogen and subsequently destroying the entire plant, killing the ammonids and releasing ammonia gas into the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|The group {{received}} {{an influx of}} funds in the late 1970s, which it used to pay housing and other expenses. In 1985, Nettles died, leaving Applewhite distraught and challenging his views on physical ascension. In the early 1990s the group took more steps to publicize their theology. In 1996, they learned of the approach of Comet Hale–Bopp and rumors of an accompanying spaceship. They concluded that this spaceship was the vessel that would take their spirits on board for a journey to another planet. Believing that their souls would ascend to the spaceship and be given new bodies, the group members committed mass suicide in their mansion. A media circus followed the discovery of <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b> <b>In</b> the aftermath, commentators and academics discussed how Applewhite persuaded people to follow his commands, including suicide. Some commentators attributed his followers' willingness to commit suicide to his skill as a manipulator, while others argued that their willingness was due to {{their faith in the}} narrative that he constructed.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea about}} the men with the inborn ability to leave <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>in</b> a spirit form, has also been {{recorded}} in Slovene and Croat traditions. The spirit {{could turn into a}} bull, dog, bore, or some other animal. He intercepted bringers of bad weather, and fought with them to save the crops of his village. The men with this ability were designated by various names, such as vedomec in Tolmin, mogut in Turopolje, vremenjak in Lika and Sinj, legromant or nagromant in southern Dalmatia and the area around Dubrovnik, višćun in Dalmatia, and štrigun in Istria. A vedomec fought against another vedomec, a mogut against another mogut, and so on, and the winner would take bad weather to the region of his defeated foe. All these men were marked by some peculiarity connected with their birth. There were also supernatural beings, such as obilnjaks and brgants in Slovenia, and kombals in Međimurje, who clashed with each other during thunderstorms over the plenty of their territories.|$|E
5|$|The {{territorial}} {{call of the}} Australian raven is a slow, high ah-ah-aaaah {{with the}} last note drawn out. It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area. When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while perched on a prominent position. It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>in</b> an upright posture. This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species {{are very difficult to}} tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so, although the drawing-out of the final note—long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven—has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.|$|E
5|$|The zduhaći {{of a band}} {{would leave}} <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>in</b> sleep and gather at an {{appointed}} place, before flying into a battle. They used various weapons, such as spindles, beech buds, sharp splinters, leaves, stalks of straw, fluff, flakes, sand, long twigs, cornel stones, pine cones, eggshells, and other light objects. As believed in Herzegovina, zduhaći uprooted gigantic firs and oaks and fought with them. However, the most powerful zduhać weapon was held to be a stick of luč (resinous wood burned to give light or used as kindling) charred at both ends, or any charred splinter of wood. A zduhać who was hit with this weapon would surely die. People therefore avoided igniting the sticks at both ends, and they took care that no splinters were left half-burned.|$|E

25|$|In {{the modern}} era, {{professional}} performers (including dancers, singers, and actors) {{are not considered}} to be respectable in the Middle East, and there is a strong social stigma attached to female performers in particular, since they display <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>in</b> public, which is considered haram in Islam.|$|E
25|$|Communists, red sympathizers {{and their}} {{families}} are being massacred by the thousands. Backlands army units are reported to have executed thousands of communists after interrogation in remote jails.

25|$|The benandanti, who {{included}} {{both males and}} females, were individuals who believed that they ensured the protection of their community and its crops. The benandanti reported leaving <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>in</b> the shape of mice, cats, rabbits, or butterflies. The men mostly reported flying into the clouds battling against witches to secure fertility for their community; the women more often reported attending great feasts.|$|E
25|$|There was no autopsy held on Dan or Steve, {{and there}} have been many stories about what might have happened. The {{arrangement}} of <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>in</b> the hotel suggests they may have killed themselves. This was the story that was used in the first Kelly film, The Story of the Kelly Gang in 1906, and in the 2003 Ned Kelly movie.|$|E
25|$|Most of Ridgway's {{victims were}} {{alleged to be}} sex workers and other women in {{vulnerable}} situations, including underage runaways. The press gave him his nickname after the first five victims {{were found in the}} Green River before his identity was known. He strangled the women, usually by hand but sometimes using ligatures. After strangling them, he would dump <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>in</b> forested and overgrown areas in King County, often returning to the dead bodies to have sexual intercourse with them.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the study}} {{published}} in Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, the test subjects supported with their hands, on average, 69.16% of <b>their</b> <b>body</b> mass <b>in</b> the up position, and 75.04% in the down position during the traditional push-ups. In modified push-ups, where knees are used as the pivot point, subjects supported 53.56% and 61.80% of <b>their</b> <b>body</b> mass <b>in</b> up and down positions, respectively.|$|R

25|$|During hibernation, these bats need an {{environment}} that ranges from 32 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit. Virginia big-eared bats store {{a certain amount of}} body fat in the winter during their hibernation, so when they are disturbed and the temperature of the cave changes, they must use up their body fat to raise the temperature of <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>in</b> order for them to leave the disturbed area. The burning of their fat makes them very weak and causes female bats to leave their babies if a maternity site is disturbed or altered.|$|E
25|$|During the Jewish {{insurgency}} in Palestine, the Jewish underground group Irgun launched {{a number of}} attacks against British military and police forces in the Netanya area. The town itself was a bastion {{of support for the}} Irgun. The most infamous incident happened in July 1947, in {{what became known as the}} Sergeants affair. After three Irgun fighters had been sentenced to death by the British, the Irgun abducted two British sergeants on a Netanya street, and hid them in an abandoned factory. The British responded by declaring martial law and placing Netanya and the surrounding area under curfew. The British Army searched the town and interrogated residents, but did not find the sergeants. After the three Irgun fighters were hanged, the Irgun hanged the two sergeants in the factory and re-hanged and booby trapped <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>in</b> an orange grove.|$|E
25|$|Initial assault movement. Movement to {{the target}} area was {{typically}} by long, roundabout routes to conceal the mission and fool enemy observation. Once they had reached the target, infiltrators in the advance units spread themselves around the perimeter according to their assigned tasks. Detailed prior reconnaissance helped in this effort. They strapped weapons and explosive charges to their bodies to minimize noise as they maneuvered through the outer band of fortifications, and often covered <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>in</b> charcoal and grease to aid movement and make detection more difficult. Barbed wire was sometimes only cut partially, with the remaining strands broken by hand to muffle the tell-tale “snip” of wire-cutters. Tripflares were neutralized by wrapping their triggers with cloth or strips of bamboo carried {{in the teeth of}} the vanguard fighters. Claymore mines might be turned in another direction.|$|E
50|$|According to {{research}} performed by Professor Jake Socha at Virginia Tech, these snakes {{can change the}} shape of <b>their</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> order to produce aerodynamic forces so they can glide in the air.

5000|$|Penchapechi: An unusual form of ghost. The Penchapechi {{take the}} form of an owl and haunt in the forests of Bengal. It follows {{helpless}} travelers through the woods until they are completely alone, and then it strikes. Unlike other ghosts, the Penchapechi actually consumes its victims, feeding on <b>their</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> an almost vampiric way.|$|R
50|$|Cordulephya is a genus of dragonflies in {{the family}} Cordulephyidae, endemic to eastern Australia. The species are small to tiny in size, {{coloured}} black, or purplish-black, with yellowish markings. Unusually for Anisoptera, these dragonflies rest with their wings folded above <b>their</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> a similar manner to many species of damselfly. They {{are commonly known as}} shutwings.|$|R
25|$|As with Eady, Christie {{repeatedly}} raped {{his last}} three victims {{while they were}} unconscious and continued to do so as they died (copious quantities of semen were found inside these victims' bodies). When this aspect of his crimes was publicly revealed, Christie quickly gained {{a reputation for being}} a necrophiliac. One commentator, however, has cautioned against categorising Christie as such; according to the accounts Christie gave to the police, he did not engage sexually with any of his victims exclusively after death. After Christie had murdered each of his final victims by ligature strangulation, he placed a vest or other cloth-like material between their legs before wrapping their semi-naked bodies in blankets (in a similar manner {{to the way in which}} Beryl Evans's body had been wrapped), before stowing <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>in</b> a small alcove behind the back kitchen wall. He later covered the entrance to this alcove with wallpaper.|$|E
25|$|Body image {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} {{psychological}} effects and physical effects. Throughout history, it has been extremely difficult for people {{to live up to the}} standards of society and what they believe the ideal body is. There are many factors that lead to a person’s body image, some of these include: family dynamics, mental illness, biological predispositions and environmental causes for obesity or malnutrition, and cultural expectations (e.g., media and politics). People who are both underweight and overweight can have poor body image. However, because people are constantly told and shown the cosmetic appeal of weight loss and are warned about the risks of obesity, those who are normal or overweight on the BMI scale have higher risks of poor body image. This is something that can lead to a change in a person's body image. Often, people who have a low body image will try to alter <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>in</b> some way, such as by dieting or undergoing cosmetic surgery.|$|E
25|$|Titus' revenge {{may also}} have been {{influenced}} by Seneca's play Thyestes, written in the first century AD. In the mythology of Thyestes, which is the basis for Seneca's play, Thyestes, son of Pelops, King of Pisa, who, along with his brother Atreus, was exiled by Pelops for the murder of their half-brother, Chrysippus. They take up refuge in Mycenae and soon ascend to co-inhabit the throne. However, each becomes jealous of the other, and Thyestes tricks Atreus into electing him as the sole king. Determined to re-attain the throne, Atreus enlists the aid of Zeus and Hermes, and has Thyestes banished from Mycenae. Atreus subsequently discovers that his wife, Aerope, had been having an affair with Thyestes, and he vows revenge. He asks Thyestes to return to Mycenae with his family, telling him that all past animosities are forgotten. However, when Thyestes returns, Atreus secretly kills Thyestes' sons, Pelopia and Aegisthus. He cuts off their hands and heads, and cooks the rest of <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>in</b> a pie. At a reconciliatory feast, Atreus serves Thyestes the pie in which his sons have been baked. As Thyestes finishes his meal, Atreus produces the hands and heads, revealing to the horrified Thyestes what he has done.|$|E
