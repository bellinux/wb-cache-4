40|$|We {{construct}} a two-country (innovative North and imitating South) model of product-cycle trade, fully endogenous Schumpeterian growth, and national patent policies. A move towards harmonization based on stronger Southern {{intellectual property rights}} (IPR) protection accelerates the long-run global rates of innovation and growth, reduces the North-South wage gap, and has an ambiguous effect on the rate of international technology <b>transfer.</b> <b>Patent</b> harmonization constitutes a suboptimal global-growth policy. However, if the global economy is governed by a common patent policy regime, then stronger global IPR protection: (a) increases the rates of global innovation and growth; (b) accelerates the rate of international technology transfer; and (c) has {{no impact on the}} North-South wage gap.

40|$|Developing countries, and particularly, {{those with}} a growing {{technological}} capacity, expect foreign technology transfers to increase when strengthening their intellectual property protection (IPR) rights. This paper evaluates empirically the impact of IPR on disembodied knowledge trade. It presents an exploration on Bilateral French Technology Receipts at the industry level for the period 1994 - 2000. Two main findings stem from our analysis. First, {{it is found that}} IPR affects positively international knowledge contracting. Nevertheless, our findings show that the impact of IPR protection differs according to countries' income level and technological capacity. Stronger IPR rights can deter technology contracting in developing economies. Second, the effects of IPR protection are found to differ across industries. Stronger protection is found to be irrelevant to attract knowledge contracting in R&D-intensive industries, contrarily to middle R&D-intensive industries. Lastly, our findings on industries' sensitivity to foreign IPR protection differ from the results reported by survey studies (Mansfield et alii, 1968; Levin et alii, 1987, Cohen et alii, 2000) concerning the relative importance of IPR protection across industries to appropriate innovation.

40|$|In {{light of}} larger public policy debates over {{intellectual}} property and climate change, this article considers patent practice, law, and policy {{in respect of}} biofuels. This debate has significant implications for public policy discussions in respect of energy independence, food security, and climate change. The first section of the paper provides a network analysis of patents in respect of biofuels across the three generations. It provides empirical research in respect of patent subject matter, ownership, and strategy in respect of biofuels. The second section provides {{a case study of}} significant patent litigation over biofuels. There is an examination of the biofuels patent litigation between the Danish company Novozymes, and Danisco and DuPont. The third section examines flexibilities in respect of patent law and clean technologies {{in the context of the}} case study of biofuels. In particular, it explores the debate over substantive doctrinal matters in respect of biofuels – such as patentable subject matter, technology <b>transfer,</b> <b>patent</b> pools, compulsory licensing, and disclosure requirements.

For professors who had existing industry connections, the policy decreased patenting, but for those without prior industry connections, it increased patenting. Overall, fewer university inventions were patented following the shift from inventor to institutional ownership. nrpages: 39 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{the age of}} {{the patent}} troll, patents are often {{licensed}} and <b>transferred.</b> A <b>transferred</b> <b>patent</b> may have been subject to multiple complex license agreements. It cannot be that such a <b>transfer</b> wipes the <b>patent</b> clean of all outstanding license agreements; the licensee must keep the license. But at the same time, it cannot be that the patent transferee becomes a party to a complex and sweeping license agreement – the contract – merely by virtue of acquiring one patent. This article attempts to separate the in personam aspects of a license agreement from its effects on the underlying in rem patent rights, using Hohfeld’s framework of jural relations and the “bundle of sticks” conception of property. A license agreement can diminish (but not add to) the bundle of in rem patent rights initially granted by the USPTO, and a new patent owner takes only the diminished bundle of rights upon transfer, given that one cannot transfer more than what one owns. The bundle theory can provide greater clarity regarding the extent to which licenses “run with the patent,” and also has implications for how <b>patent</b> <b>transfer</b> affects other doctrines such as patent exhaustion, FRAND obligations, prior user rights, and laches...|$|R

40|$|This study explores empirically {{the factors}} {{determining}} the propensity of Swiss science institutions {{at the level}} of a single institute or department to get involved in a wide spectrum of knowledge and technology transfer (KTT) activities with private corporations. A main finding is that scientific institutes with a stronger orientation to applied research and/or lower teaching obligations are also stronger inclined to get involved in overall KTT activities. The same is valid for institutes which have already had experience with industry co-operations as reflected by a high share of external funds in an institute's budget. Further, there is no systematic size effect with respect to KTT activities. Institutes of engineering, natural sciences and economics/management are strongly represented among KTT-active institutes. Universities of applied sciences have an above-average propensity to KTT activities. Knowledge and technology <b>transfer</b> <b>Patenting</b> Licensing Spin-offs...|$|R
40|$|Patent Assertion Entities (“PAEs”) {{are playing}} a growing role in the United States, but also in Europe. Their {{activities}} are controversial in that while they may {{be a source of}} efficiencies, they may also create anticompetitive harm. Given the growing trend of operating companies <b>transferring</b> <b>patents</b> to PAEs in order to increase their licensing revenues, the risks of anticompetitive harm created by PAE activities must be taken seriously. When analysing the impact of PAE activities on competition, a distinction must be drawn between “pure” PAEs, which acquire patents {{from a variety of sources}} and generate revenues by asserting them, and “hybrid” PAEs, which acquire patents from operating companies and maintain a relationship with these companies post-acquisition. While pure PAEs create risks of exploitation, hybrid PAEs create exclusionary concerns as such PAEs may be used by operating companies to harm their rivals on downstream product markets. These exclusionary concerns are particularly serious when the operating company retains a significant degree of control over the activities of the PAE following the <b>transfer</b> of the <b>patents.</b> As there is currently no EU competition case-law on the activities of PAEs, this paper attempts to show through hypotheticals that depending on the circumstances of each case, privateering may lead to exclusion...|$|R

We use a uniquely constructed patent data set on SO 2 abatement technologies filed in 15 signatory and non-signatory countries in the period 1970 - 1997. The data distinguish between so-called 'mother' patents, or original inventions, and 'family' patents, which represent the same invention but are patentsfiled in foreign countries. Our analysis suggests that not only local environmental regulations matter for patenting decisions.

40|$|Focusing {{specifically}} on regulation of coal-fired power plants, we examine how technological innovation by early adopters influences {{the timing of}} new environmental regulation in non-innovating countries. We build a general equilibrium model of an open economy to identify the political-economy determinants of regulation. With a newly created dataset of SO 2 and NOx regulations for coal-fired power plants and a patent-based measure of the technology frontier, we estimate the determinants of environmental regulation diffusion. Our findings {{support the hypothesis that}} international economic integration eases access to environmentally friendly technologies and leads to earlier adoption, ceteris paribus, of regulation in non-innovating countries. However, we also find evidence that domestic trade protection promotes earlier adoption allowing shifts of regulatory costs to domestic consumers. Furthermore, international market power permits large countries to shift costs to foreign consumers. Other political economy factors, such as the quality of domestic coal, are also important determinants. Technology <b>transfer</b> <b>Patents</b> Air pollution Political economy Regulation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} optimal {{design of a}} patent {{challenge}} mechanism through the re-allocation of patent rights, in which a successful challenger is rewarded with partial patent rights previously granted to the patentee. Two incentive problems are critical {{to the shape of}} the optimal mechanism: How to provide a potential challenger with adequate incentives to look for the defeating prior art, and whether and how to prevent collusion once the prior art has been found. <b>Transferring</b> <b>patent</b> rights to a successful challenger encourages search and deters collusion; it also reduces costly opportunistic patenting and therefore improves patent application quality. However, from an ex post point of view, over-search ensues when collusion is severe or when the challenger is the only user of the technology. The optimal policy, then, calls for a careful balance between these costs and benefits. The paper also shows that when multiple players search sequentially, lower patent quality may alleviate collusion problem and the optimal policy may deter collusion in the later stage while accommodating collusion between the patent-holder and the fact-finder after the early stage of search. Partial collusion-deterrence preserves the subsequent searcher’s incentives and reduces the cost to fight collusion...|$|R
