In several places the road needed to be dug up to remove pipes and cables. In November 2009, Gulating Court of Appeal ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> company BKK had to pay 80 million NOK for the moving of power lines, and could not charge the costs to the project. By June 2008, the first tracks had been laid.|$|E
5|$|Martin Luther King Jr. was the {{conscience}} of his generation. He gazed upon {{the great wall of}} segregation and saw <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of love could bring it down. From the pain and exhaustion of his fight to fulfill the promises of our founding fathers for our humblest citizens, he wrung his eloquent statement of his dream for America. He made our nation stronger because he made it better. His dream sustains us yet.|$|E
5|$|The Power of Four was so {{negatively}} received, that it {{was announced}} that future British and Irish Lions tours would have songs and themes chosen by a musical committee set up {{in the wake of the}} 2005 tour instead of by the team coach. After 2005, The Power of Four became largely forgotten. During the 2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia, ESPN jokingly suggested <b>that</b> <b>The</b> <b>Power</b> of Four would be remixed into a hip hop song for the third test by Pharrell Williams and would be performed by Snoop Dogg.|$|E

5|$|The {{respondents}} {{also noted}} that Gaudron made similar comments in the Stolen Generations case, which also considered non-judicial detention {{in the context of}} Aboriginal children who were forcibly removed from their parents' care. For this reason and others, they argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to detain people for the purposes of criminal trial and punishment (as opposed to detention generally) was clearly a judicial function, but there is no general rule and other powers to detain may not offend Chapter III.|$|E
5|$|Ambitious {{reporter}} Amy Harkin (Nancy McKeon) {{is stuck}} {{reporting on the}} heat wave while trying to find proof behind the scenes that Lexer and Midwest {{are responsible for the}} lack of sufficient power. The Secretary of Energy, Shirley Abbott (Dianne Wiest), is actively warning various politicians and the president <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> grid is too outdated to handle real natural disasters and that it is too vulnerable to attack. Dan London (Ari Cohen), the chief engineer of Lexer, has also repeatedly warned Lexer that their systems are too vulnerable to hackers, but the company is only interested in going with the cheapest options. He decides to blow the whistle on the company to Harkin, but as he refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will not allow the piece to air.|$|E
5|$|At the Simpsons' home, Bart and Ralph {{discover}} that the penitentiary will once again {{be used by the}} town, and remember that they forgot to disable the power. Unaware <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> is active, Mayor Quimby straps himself into the electric chair in a publicity attempt. Ralph then tells Bart that Lisa can probably {{figure out a way to}} warn the Mayor. She decides to launch a model rocket with a warning message attached and aims it toward the penitentiary. However, the rocket is blown off-course and crashes through Mr. Burns' office window. Mr. Burns reads the note and disables the penitentiary's power. In the aftermath, the Simpsons congratulate Ralph, for pointing out that Lisa could solve the problem.|$|E

5|$|Frederick married Victoria, Princess Royal, eldest {{daughter}} of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. The couple were well-matched; their shared liberal ideology {{led them to}} seek greater representation for commoners in the government. Frederick, {{in spite of his}} conservative militaristic family background, had developed liberal tendencies {{as a result of his}} ties with Britain and his studies at the University of Bonn. As the Crown Prince, he often opposed the conservative Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, particularly in speaking out against Bismarck's policy of uniting Germany through force, and in urging <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of the Chancellorship be curbed. Liberals in both Germany and Britain hoped that as emperor, Frederick III would move to liberalize the German Empire.|$|E
5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
5|$|In Tantra, {{the fifty}} or fifty-one letters {{including}} vowels {{as well as}} consonants from A to Ksha, of the Devanagari alphabet itself, the Varnamala of bija, {{have been described as}} being the Matrikas themselves. It is believed that they are infused with the power of the Divine Mother herself. The Matrikas are considered to be the subtle form of the letters (varna). These letters combined make up syllables (pada) which are combined to make sentences (vakya) and it is of these elements that mantra is composed. It is believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of mantra derives {{from the fact that the}} letters of the alphabet are in fact forms of the goddess. The 50 Matrika Kalas are given in the same account as follows: Nivritti, Pratishtha, Vidya, Shanti, Indhika, Dipika, Mochika, Para, Sukshma, Sukshmamrita, Jnanamrita, Apypayani, Vyapini, Vyomarupa, Ananta, Srishti, Riddhi, Smriti, Medha, Kanti, Lakshmi, Dyuti, Sthira, Sthiti, Siddhi, Jada, Palini, Shanti, Aishvarya, Rati, Kamika, Varada, Ahladini, Pritih, Dirgha, Tikshna, Raudri, Bhaya, Nidra, Tadra, Kshudha, Krodhini, Kriya, Utkari, Mrityurupa, Pita, Shveta, Asita, Ananta. Sometimes, the Matrikas represent a diagram written in the letter, believed to possess magical powers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of ministerial discretion, it has been {{established}} in Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of Works (1943) that it is not unlawful for a civil servant to take a decision on behalf of the minister, even where a statute confers discretion on a minister. Parliament will expect only <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> is to be exercised by an appropriate official. However, the minister is ultimately responsible for decisions taken on his or her behalf. While there has been discussion in case law about whether a minister should be required to personally exercise discretion in decisions that affect a person's liberty, the courts have usually been reluctant to hold so. Such a requirement, however, has been made by way of statutes which require the minister to act personally.|$|E
5|$|The James Bay {{hydroelectric}} dam complex contains several {{relatively short}} 735kV power lines that send electricity to three principal substations, ordered from west to east: Radisson, Chissibi, and Lemoyne. From these substations, six 735kV power lines traverse the vast expanses of taiga and boreal forest in clear-cut stretches of land; this shows up clearly in aerial photos. The terrain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> lines cross {{is for the}} most part not mountainous, but smooth and replete with lakes. Generally, four of the lines runs together in two pairs and the other two run solo, although the two single lines sometimes do run in a pair. Two intermediate 735kV power lines, one in the north and one in the south, connect all six power lines along their path to southern Quebec.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} one of the most {{recently}} built coal-fired power stations in the United Kingdom, but with a generating capacity of only 420megawatts (MW), is now one of the smallest operating. Two separate wind farm plans currently have permission to be built near the station, one for a 13 turbine wind farm near the smelter and another three turbine wind farm to the north of the station. In 2009, Alcan announced that they hope to fit the station with carbon capture and storage technology. In 2011, it was announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> station may be converted to burn biomass only, in a bid to avoid government legislation. In January 2016 the station was purchased by Energetický a průmyslový holding (EPH).|$|E

5|$|The station's {{boiler house}} houses three 380MWth International Combustion boilers, which are fuelled by {{pulverised}} bituminous coal. Each of these provide steam {{for one of}} three 140 megawatt (MW) Parsons turbo-alternators, situated in the station's turbine hall. These give the station a total generating capacity of 420MW. The electricity generated was fed at 24 kilovolt (kV) to a substation to power the smelter during operation. The substation also has a 132kV connection to the National Grid, where electricity is distributed to homes and other industries by Northern Electric Distribution Limited. The smelter's two pot lines required 310MW of the 420MW <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> station produces, so the excess 110MW which was fed into the national grid. Since the mothballing of the smelter, all exports now go to the grid.|$|E
5|$|This {{increase}} in population caused many adverse effects. Municipal Utilities Service, which operated telephone service, {{ran out of}} phone numbers and the waiting list for phone connections stretched to 1,500 entries. Electric demand was so high <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> company advised homeowners to buy generators to cope with frequent brownouts. Home prices skyrocketed—a home that sold for $40,000 in 1974 was purchased for $80,000 in 1975. Home and apartment rentals were correspondingly squeezed upward by the rising prices and the demand from pipeline workers. Two-room log cabins with no plumbing rented for $500 per month. One two-bedroom home housed 45 pipeline workers who shared beds on a rotating schedule for $40 per week.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s {{electricity}} was supplied by municipal undertakings. These were small power companies that built power stations {{dedicated to a}} single industry or group of factories, and sold any excess electricity to the public. These companies used widely differing standards of voltage and frequency. In 1925 Parliament decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> grid should be a single system with uniform standards and under public ownership. Several of the private power companies reacted to the proposal by forming the London Power Company. They planned to heed parliament's recommendations and build {{a small number of}} very large stations.|$|E

5|$|With Weir (Torri Higginson) incapacitated, Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) {{is forced}} to take command of Atlantis. McKay (David Hewlett) determines <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> {{conduits}} are damaged, preventing Atlantis from completing its jump to the planet M12-578. While teams are sent to patch them up, the shield starts to collapse, resulting {{in the deaths of}} one team. McKay later decides to collapse the shield to cover the central tower in order to conserve power, and give Zelenka (David Nykl) time to patch up the conduits. However, the city approaches an asteroid belt, {{and the only way to}} go through without using up the power is for Sheppard to lead a fleet of Puddle Jumpers and clear a path. Although inexperienced, the pilots succeed, but impacts from the stragglers damage the stardrive control crystals, and they have to fix it before jumping again.|$|E
5|$|With over 100 {{transmission}} lines paralyzed by the ice, Quebec {{fell into a}} massive power outage in the cold Canadian winter. Even though power restoration initiated after the first blackouts, large numbers of Quebecers were in the dark. At {{the height of the}} blackout, some 1.4–1.5 million homes and customers, housing three to more than four million people, were in the dark. Private companies and other utilities from other parts of Canada and the United States were sent in to help Hydro-Québec undertake this massive restoration task, but these efforts were complicated by the widespread damage of the power grid. Blackouts in some areas lasted for 33 days, and 90% of those affected by the blackout had no power for more than seven days. Although power was fully restored to all locations in Quebec by February 8, 1998, it wasn't until mid-March <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> facilities were back in service. By then, much social and economic damage had occurred, such as ruined food and deaths resulting from lack of electric heating.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} has erupted {{since the late}} 20thcentury over the four lower Snake River dams, with the primary argument being that removing the dams would allow anadromous fish to reach the lower Snake River tributaries—the Clearwater River, the Tucannon River and the Grande Ronde River—and spawn in much higher numbers. However, removal of the dams has been fiercely opposed by some groups in the Pacific Northwest. Because much of the electricity in the Northwest comes from dams, removing the four dams would create {{a hole in the}} energy grid that would not be immediately replaceable. Navigation on the lower Snake would also suffer, as submerged riffles, rapids and islands would be exposed by the removal of the dams. Irrigation pumps for fields in southeastern Washington would also have to reach further to access the water of the Snake River. However, aside from restoring salmon runs, dam removal proponents argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> is replaceable, that the grain transportation system could be replaced by railroads, and that only one of the four reservoirs supplies irrigation water. Irrigators in the Snake River Plain would likely need to allow less water into the Snake River during low flow {{in order to create a}} current in the four lower reservoirs, and recreation and tourism would likely benefit.|$|E
