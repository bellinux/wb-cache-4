5|$|Alex is a {{young man}} who is {{depressed}} after his fiancée breaks up with him. Tired of seeing him unhappy, Alex's grandmother sends him Ada, a Tanaka X-5 android which is capable of intelligent human interaction. The robot is initially incapable of self-awareness, as each android has a program <b>that</b> <b>blocks</b> any potential free thought or consciousness.|$|E
5|$|DNA damage {{checkpoint}} is {{a signal}} transduction pathway <b>that</b> <b>blocks</b> cell cycle progression in G1, G2 and metaphase and slows down {{the rate of}} S phase progression when DNA is damaged. It leads to a pause in cell cycle allowing the cell time {{to repair the damage}} before continuing to divide.|$|E
5|$|The {{system of}} {{numbering}} the frieze blocks dates back to Adolf Michaelis's 1871 work Der Parthenon, and since then Ian Jenkins has revised this scheme {{in the light of}} recent discoveries. The convention, here preserved, is <b>that</b> <b>blocks</b> are numbered in Roman and figures in Arabic numerals, the figures are numbered left to right against the direction of the procession on the north and west and with it on the south.|$|E

5000|$|Iteration in {{computing}} is {{the technique}} marking {{out of a}} block of statements within a computer program for a defined number of repetitions. <b>That</b> <b>block</b> of statements {{is said to be}} iterated; a computer scientist might also refer to <b>that</b> <b>block</b> of statements as an [...] "iteration".|$|R
5|$|Usman Shabbir of the Pakistan Military Consortium {{has said}} <b>that</b> <b>Block</b> 3 {{aircraft}} might include AESA radar, HMD, avionics improvements, {{and perhaps some}} reworking of the airframe. Local media has indicated that a 2-seat version will also be part of Block III package. Unconfirmed reports says <b>that</b> <b>Block</b> III will also have better flight management system/software. On 17 June 2015, Jane's Defence Weekly confirmed this <b>that</b> <b>Block</b> 3 will have an AESA radar and will also include a helmet-mounted display (HMD) and possibly an internal infrared search and tracking (IRST) system.|$|R
5|$|Viewing the Sun through light-concentrating optics such as {{binoculars}} {{may result}} in permanent damage to the retina without an appropriate filter <b>that</b> <b>blocks</b> UV and substantially dims the sunlight. When using an attenuating filter to view the Sun, the viewer is cautioned to use a filter specifically designed for that use. Some improvised filters that pass UV or IR rays, can actually harm the eye at high brightness levels.|$|E
5|$|When Frost {{meets with}} a Soviet {{general in the}} USSR, and uses her telepathic powers to pretend {{to have sex with}} him, Xavier and Lehnsherr capture Frost and {{discover}} that Shaw intends to start World War III and trigger mutant ascendency. Azazel, Riptide and Shaw attack Division X, killing everyone but the mutants, whom Shaw invites to join him. Salvadore accepts; when Summers and Muñoz retaliate, Shaw kills Muñoz. In Moscow, Shaw compels the general to have the USSR install missiles in Cuba. Wearing a helmet <b>that</b> <b>blocks</b> telepathy, Shaw follows the Soviet fleet in a submarine to ensure the missiles break a US blockade.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes, its skyline {{dominated}} by the massive statue, the Colossus of Rhodes, is a war-torn city under assault by Kratos, the God of War, and his Spartan army. The Lair of Typhon, hidden in an unknown location, is a snow-topped mountain and prison of the Titans Typhon and Prometheus. The Island of Creation is a vast island located {{at the edge of}} the world and home to the Sisters of Fate. The island is host to deadly traps, puzzles, and monsters. On the outskirts of the island are the Steeds of Time, and on the island itself are the Temples of Lakhesis and Atropos, and the Bog of the Forgotten, which hides the Gorgon Euryale and is the site of Jason of the Argonauts' last battle. Beyond the Bog are the Lowlands and the Great Chasm: a huge divide <b>that</b> <b>blocks</b> the way to the Palace of the Fates. At the base of the Chasm is the realm of Tartarus—prison of the Titan Atlas, condemned to hold the world on his shoulders. The Temple of the Fates is also filled with traps and monsters, while the final battle occurs on Mount Olympus, home to the gods.|$|E

5|$|The {{number and}} {{diversity}} of subunits contained in the 20S core particle depends on the organism; the number of distinct and specialized subunits is larger in multicellular than unicellular organisms and larger in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes. All 20S particles consist of four stacked heptameric ring structures that are themselves composed of {{two different types of}} subunits; α subunits are structural in nature, whereas β subunits are predominantly catalytic. The outer two rings in the stack consist of seven α subunits each, which serve as docking domains for the regulatory particles and the alpha subunits N-termini form a gate <b>that</b> <b>blocks</b> unregulated access of substrates to the interior cavity. The inner two rings each consist of seven β subunits and contain the protease active sites that perform the proteolysis reactions. Three distinct catalytic activities were identified in the purified complex: chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing. The size of the proteasome is relatively conserved and is about 150 angstroms (Å) by 115Å. The interior chamber is at most 53Å wide, though the entrance can be as narrow as 13Å, suggesting that substrate proteins must be at least partially unfolded to enter.|$|E

25|$|Raw {{egg whites}} contain a protein (avidin) <b>that</b> <b>blocks</b> the {{absorption}} of biotin, so people who regularly consume {{a large number of}} eggs may become biotin-deficient. The dietary biotin intake in Western populations has been estimated to be 35 to 70micrograms per day (143–287nmol per day).|$|E
25|$|Chlorotoxin is a 36–amino acid peptide {{found in}} the venom of the deathstalker {{scorpion}} (Leiurus quinquestriatus) <b>that</b> <b>blocks</b> small-conductance chloride channels. The fact that chlorotoxin binds preferentially to glioma cells has allowed {{the development of new}} methods, that still are under investigation, for the treatment and diagnosis of several types of cancer.|$|E
25|$|Pancuronium bromide (Trade name: Pavulon): The related drug curare, like pancuronium, is a non-depolarizing {{muscle relaxant}} (a paralytic agent) <b>that</b> <b>blocks</b> {{the action of}} {{acetylcholine}} at the motor end-plate of the neuromuscular junction. Binding of acetylcholine to receptors on the end-plate causes depolarization and contraction of the muscle fiber; non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents like pancuronium stop this binding from taking place.|$|E

30|$|As {{it will be}} {{described}} in Subsection 4.3, we have assumed that TC is only related {{to the size of}} the block and is independent of the residual values. Hence, the second part of the model of (3), representing the residual coding behavior of <b>that</b> <b>block</b> by an exponential function, is independent of the motion compensation process of <b>that</b> <b>block.</b> The first part of the model of (3) reflects the motion compensation process of the block which is independent of residual coding of <b>that</b> <b>block</b> as well, because D 0 is related only to the original pixels values of the current block and the reconstructed pixels values of the reference frame.|$|R
25|$|Piperazine is a flaccid paralyzing agent <b>that</b> <b>blocks</b> the {{response}} of Ascaris muscle to acetylcholine, which immobilizes the worm. It prevents migration when treatment is accomplished with weak drugs such as thiabendazole. If used by itself, it causes the worm to be passed out in the feces and may be used when worms have caused blockage of the intestine or the biliary duct.|$|E
25|$|Etisalat {{operates}} an Internet {{content filtering}} system <b>that</b> <b>blocks</b> access to web resources. The web resources are {{claimed to be}} controversial or offensive (i.e. sexually explicit content, certain political and religious websites, anonymizers and proxies) or harmful (i.e. numeric IP addresses, known phishing or malicious websites, botnet command servers). The use of content filtering is mandated by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) of the United Arab Emirates.|$|E
25|$|Modified {{digital cameras}} can detect some ultraviolet, {{all of the}} visible {{and much of the}} near {{infrared}} spectrum, as most digital imaging sensors are sensitive from about 350nm to 1000nm. An off-the-shelf digital camera contains an infrared hot mirror filter <b>that</b> <b>blocks</b> most of the infrared and a bit of the ultraviolet that would otherwise be detected by the sensor, narrowing the accepted range from about 400nm to 700nm.|$|E

25|$|The {{increased}} CO2 levels deactivated three genes {{within the}} soybean plant that normally create chemical defenses against pest insects. One of these defenses is a protein <b>that</b> <b>blocks</b> digestion of the soy leaves in insects. Since this gene was deactivated, the beetles {{were able to}} digest a much higher amount of plant matter than the beetles in the control field. This led to the observed longer lifespans and higher egg-laying rates in the experimental field.|$|E
25|$|The word stop is {{sometimes}} confusing {{due to its}} multiple meanings. A stop can be a physical object: an opaque part of an optical system <b>that</b> <b>blocks</b> certain rays. The aperture stop is the aperture setting that limits {{the brightness of the}} image by restricting the input pupil size, while a field stop is a stop intended to cut out light that would be outside the desired field of view and might cause flare or other problems if not stopped.|$|E
25|$|Uterine artery {{embolization}} (UAE) is a noninvasive procedure <b>that</b> <b>blocks</b> {{of blood}} flow to fibroids and thus can treat them. Long term outcomes with respect to how happy people are with the procedure are {{similar to that of}} surgery. There is tentative evidence that traditional surgery may result in better fertility. One review found that UAE doubles the future risk of miscarriage. UAE also appears to require more repeat procedures than if surgery was done initially. A person will usually recover from the procedure within a few days.|$|E

30|$|We have {{introduced}} this measure {{in our previous}} work [19]. Briefly, quad tree representation is introduced for binary images {{but it can be}} obtained for gray scale images, too. For a gray scale image, we use the intensity variance in blocks as a measure of contrast. If the variance is lower than a predefined threshold, it means that there is not much detail in <b>that</b> <b>block</b> (i.e., pixels of the block are very similar to each other), thus, <b>that</b> <b>block</b> is not divided further. Otherwise, the division of <b>that</b> <b>block</b> into 4 blocks is continued until either a block cannot be divided any more or reaching to a block size of one pixel.|$|R
