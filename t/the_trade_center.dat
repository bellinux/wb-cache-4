25|$|Ellen Winner, {{appointed}} guardian ad litem for Philip, {{introduced the}} police report and argued {{that there was no}} clear evidence she was at or near <b>the</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> during the attacks.

25|$|In the 16th century, the karaeng Tunipalangga (1548–1566) gave {{permission}} to the Malay merchants {{to establish a}} trading port in the port of Makassar. They were allocated a site at Mangallekana, on the coast just south of Jeneberang river. The area quickly became a trade center, which is confirmed by {{the title of the}} Shahbandar (port master) of that period, I Daeng ri Mangallekana. The importance of this Malay fort means that a new capital is required near <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>center.</b> So Tunipalangga instructed {{the construction of a new}} fortress to the north bank of Jeneberang river, about a kilometer away from the mouth of the Jeneberang at that time.|$|E
25|$|When {{they were}} finally {{allowed to return}} to Battery Park City, some found that their homes had been looted. Upon {{residents}}' return, the air in the area was still filled with toxic smoke from the World Trade Center fires that persisted until December, 2001. More than half of the area's residents moved away permanently from the community after the adjacent World Trade Center towers collapsed and spread toxic dust, debris, and smoke. Gateway Plaza's 600 building, Hudson View East, and Parc Place (now Rector Square) were punctured by airplane parts. The Winter Garden and other portions of the World Financial Center were severely damaged. Environmental concerns regarding dust from <b>the</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> are a continuing source of concern for many residents, scientists, and elected officials. Since the attacks, the damage has been repaired. Temporarily reduced rents and government subsidies helped restore residential occupancy in the years following the attacks.|$|E

Libmanan has 156 hectares of ricefields and cornfields, and fishing along its coastline connecting the towns of Ragay and Pasacao; Libmanan also has a commercial district. Sipocot has an agricultural base economy, with an abundant stock of native chicken (Sipocot's OTOP) and wide production of calamansi and other vegetables, while also serving as trading post for towns of Cabusao, Ragay and Mercedes (Camarines Norte). Fish products from these towns are received by Sipocot. Other towns not mentioned have a fishing industry as the main base of their economy.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{destruction}} of <b>the</b> World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> station in <b>the</b> September 11 attacks, which also required the closing of Exchange Place, <b>the</b> Hoboken-World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> branch was suspended.

25|$|The family appealed, {{contrasting}} {{her case}} {{with that of}} Juan Lafuente, another possible victim whose petition the court's counterpart in Dutchess County, where he lived, had accepted. Like Philip, his exposure to the attacks is based on circumstantial evidence. He, too, had recently lost a job and struggled with depression, and as a volunteer fire marshal in Poughkeepsie might himself have had a reason to offer assistance at the attack site. His office was eight blocks north of the W.T.C. complex, but the court accepted testimony from someone who frequented the same local deli claiming he had overheard Lafuente say he had a meeting at <b>the</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> that morning. Philip's family believes Lafuente's petition, with similarly minimal evidence of the alleged decedent's presence {{at the site of}} the attacks, was accepted primarily because his wife, Colette, was mayor of Poughkeepsie at the time and the case was heard there rather than in Manhattan.|$|E
25|$|Significant cost {{increases}} {{led to the}} project being mothballed by the George H. W. Bush administration. The General Services Administration refused to sign the draft lease, arguing that the building's rental costs were too high and would cost (rather than save) the government $18 million to $24 million a year. Although Pei Cobb Freed agreed to investigate design changes to make the project less costly, at least one member of Congress declared the project dead. In September 1990, the architectural team made changes which cut $82 million from {{the cost of the}} building (including the elimination of two theaters, scaling down the reception hall, using plaster rather than stone, substituting aluminum for bronze in the trim, and reducing the size of interior doors), reducing the price tag to $656 million. Delta Partnership, a development consortium led by New York developer William Zeckendorf, Jr., was chosen to operate the building and lease it to the government. Another design change came in January 1991, when the number of parking spaces rose by 12.6 percent to 2,500 spaces. But the changes did not resolve the controversies enveloping the project. Design committee member Donald A. Brown quit the committee in late 1991, complaining that the Bush administration was meddling in the project's design. Two days later, Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C.'s delegate to Congress, repeated these charges. On January 19, 1992, even as the foundation for <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>center</b> was being dug, the GSA said the building would not achieve financial self-sufficiency. A separate report commissioned by the Bush administration reached similar conclusions. On January 25, 1992, the Bush administration cancelled the international trade center construction project. Days later, a United States district court ruled that Delta Partnership had been chosen in violation of federal contracting guidelines, although the court also refused to overturn the award after finding no bias in the award process. Construction experts decried the decision, saying that the building's costs could balloon to more than $1.2 billion if construction were resumed at a later time.|$|E

500|$|David Rockefeller {{suggested}} that the Port Authority would be a logical choice for taking on the project, [...] and argued that <b>the</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> would provide great benefits in facilitating and increasing volume of international commerce coming through the Port of New York. [...] Given the importance of New York City in global commerce, Port Authority director Austin J.

[...] After a year-long review of the proposal, the Port Authority formally backed the project on March 11, 1961.|$|E
500|$|The World Trade Center design brought {{criticism}} of its aesthetics from the American Institute of Architects and other groups. [...] Lewis Mumford, author of The City in History and other works on urban planning, criticized {{the project and}} described it and other new skyscrapers as [...] "just glass-and-metal filing cabinets." [...] Television broadcasters raised concerns that the World Trade Center twin towers would cause interference in television reception for viewers in the New York City area. In response to these concerns, the Port Authority offered to provide new television transmission facilities at the World Trade Center. [...] The Linnaean Society of the American Museum of Natural History also opposed <b>the</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> project, citing hazards the buildings would impose on migrating birds.|$|E

2500|$|Construction of the World Trade Center {{began in}} 1966 but had trouble {{attracting}} tenants when completed. Nonetheless, some substantial firms purchased space there. Its impressive height helped {{make it a}} visual landmark for drivers and pedestrians. In some respects, the nexus of the financial district moved from the street of Wall Street to <b>the</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> complex. Real estate growth during {{the latter part of}} the 1990s was significant, with deals and new projects happening in the financial district and elsewhere in Manhattan; one firm invested more than $24 billion in various projects, many in the Wall Street area. In 1998, the NYSE and the city struck a $900 million deal which kept the NYSE from moving across the river to Jersey City; the deal was described as the [...] "largest in city history to prevent a corporation from leaving town". A competitor to the NYSE, NASDAQ, moved its headquarters from Washington to New York.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept for}} a massive [...] "trade center", which would become an {{international}} headquarters for corporations and trade associations, was a more successful project. In June 1983, the Federal City Council proposed that a huge $300 million structure be built on unused land adjacent to Maine Avenue SW. Despite local citizen opposition, the organization convinced D.C. Mayor Marion Barry to begin pushing the plan through the D.C. City Council and Congress. Opposition from executive branch agencies, however, derailed the plan, and by 1986 the Federal City Council was looking for an alternative site for the building. In late 1986, the association began pushing for construction of <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>center</b> on a parking lot in Federal Triangle, an area originally intended for a major government office building in the 1930s but never built due to the financial distress caused by the Great Depression. This site won near-universal approval, and in 1987 Congress authorized construction of the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center. Donald A. Brown, who chaired the Federal City Council's International Center Task Force, was one of five people nominated to the U.S. International Cultural and Trade Center Commission, which served as a board of supervisors overseeing {{the construction of the}} building. Terence Golden, who was director of the federal government's General Services Administration (GSA) and who helped shepherd the legislation authorizing the building through Congress, later was elected {{chairman of the board of}} directors of the Federal City Council. Originally intended to cost $363 million, the $818 million Ronald Reagan Building opened on May 5, 1998, after years of funding and construction delays.|$|E
