5|$|As Perkins was in New York {{working on}} a Broadway stage show when the shower {{sequence}} was filmed, actresses Anne Dore and Margo Epper stepped in as his body doubles for <b>that</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Frankel {{generally}} {{approved of}} his editor's choices, but differed on one scene, showing more of Andrea on her errand to the Calvin Klein showroom. He felt <b>that</b> <b>scene</b> showed Andrea's job was {{about more than}} running personal errands for Miranda.|$|E
5|$|Kong's New York stage {{appearance}} {{looks very}} much like a re-enactment of the 1933 film's sacrifice scene, including the posts the 'beauty' is tied to and the nearly identical performance and costumes of the dancers. In addition, the music played by the orchestra during <b>that</b> <b>scene</b> is Max Steiner's original score for the 1933 film.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} system for augmenting depth camera output using {{multispectral}} photometric stereo. The technique is demonstrated using a Kinect sensor {{and is able to}} produce geometry independently for each frame. Improved reconstruction is demonstrated using the Kinect’s inbuilt RGB camera and further improvements are achieved by introducing an additional high resolution camera. As well as qualitative improvements in reconstruction a quantitative reduction in temporal noise is shown. As part of the system an approach is presented for relaxing the assumption of multispectral photometric stereo <b>that</b> <b>scenes</b> are of constant chromaticity to the assumption <b>that</b> <b>scenes</b> contain multiple piecewise constant chromaticities. ...|$|R
5|$|A {{recreation}} of the Body Worlds exhibit {{provided a}} setting for one {{scene in the}} film. Among the Body Worlds plastinates featured in <b>that</b> <b>scene</b> were the Poker Playing Trio (which {{plays a key role}} in one scene) and Rearing Horse and Rider. The exhibition's developer and promoter, German anatomist Gunther von Hagens, also has a cameo appearance in the film, although only his trademark hat is actually visible on screen.|$|E
5|$|I {{was sitting}} there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. I mean, it was like a puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, <b>that</b> <b>scene</b> is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} pilot remained unaired, {{although some}} footage {{from the original}} pilot {{was used in the}} first aired episode. This includes Sansa's scenes with Catelyn (Michelle Fairley's footage as Catelyn was inserted over Jennifer Ehle's performance), Will's ride through the woods (retained though also portrayed by a different actor), most of the feast at Winterfell, and Ned and Robert's scene in the crypt. <b>That</b> <b>scene</b> is one of a few to be filmed on 35 mm film, and consequently slight film grain {{can be seen in the}} HD version of the episode.|$|E
50|$|A {{case has}} been filed against the movie by a law college student Praveen of Madurai stating {{that some of the}} scenes in the movie are ill-treating the lawyers. Case has been booked against Vijay and Asin who has {{performed}} <b>that</b> <b>scenes</b> in the movie as well as the director Perarasu and the producer A.M.Ratnam are also trapped in the case. In his petition he has given five scenes of the movie in which the lawyers have been portrayed in an abusing manner. The student has also said <b>that</b> <b>scenes</b> like in movies are intruding the student’s willpower and self-confidence.|$|R

5000|$|Portions of {{the film}} were shot in South Africa at Port Elizabeth, Bechuanaland, Victoria Falls and Johannesburg. An October 1953 Daily Variety news item stated <b>that</b> <b>scenes</b> were shot at Krueger National Park.|$|R
5|$|The {{story was}} {{conceived}} around a protagonist whose abilities {{can not be}} measured through standardized evaluation; as such, he is mistakenly categorized as a poor performing student or an irregular. This premise served as a basis for the character, Tatsuya Shiba. Satō has two processes for scripting the story arcs: the first is to create scenarios to have characters behave and interact in certain ways; the second is to plan a scene, then script the story so it leads to <b>that</b> <b>scene.</b> Satō professed that he does not feel his characters are alive or have a will of their own when scripting them.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, Jack and Liz are at a jewelry store, as Jack is searching for an engagement ring for Elisa. They shot <b>that</b> <b>scene</b> in a Cartier store in New York's Fifth Avenue, which was filmed on February 22, 2009. A scene featuring Sue LaRoche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway) as the Grim Reaper, in which Jenna is led to believe Kenneth has gone into shock because of the strawberries, was cut from the airing. According to Jane Krakowski, in the DVD commentary for this episode, there were alternate scenes with Jenna letting Kenneth know about the tampering she did to Kenneth's items, his chickpea, water bottle, and harmonica.|$|E
5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of <b>that</b> <b>scene.</b> I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the context}} of film music, Claudia Gorbman defines an obstinate as a {{repeated}} melodic or rhythmic figure <b>that</b> propels <b>scenes</b> <b>that</b> lack dynamic visual action.|$|R
5000|$|Garnet {{is capable}} of using a skill known as [...] "future vision", which allows her to predict future events accurately. Eric Thurm noted <b>that</b> <b>scenes</b> in which Garnet uses her future vision are among the show's best visual accomplishments.|$|R
50|$|Also {{somewhat}} unorthodox is <b>that</b> <b>scenes</b> depicting Japanese staff {{officers were}} performed in Japanese, with only summary translations {{provided by the}} narrator. This narration was remarkably evenhanded in its characterization of the enemy for an American feature film of this period.|$|R
5|$|Some {{scenes of}} the episode {{contained}} backgrounds that were added with digital effects. One such scene was on Danny's ex-wife's house, which did not have mountains in the background; the mountains were digitally added in post-production. The same technique was used again on the village of quonset huts, and again on the freighter assault scenes, only with {{the background of the}} sea when Hesse and McGarrett fight. After the episode was filmed, the producers discovered that it was too long and spent two weeks deciding what to cut out. One of the scenes involved the team deciding on a name of their task force, but <b>that</b> <b>scene</b> was cut in favor of another episode. Manning's scenes were also cut due from the final broadcast to the length, though viewers could still make out {{the top of her head}} in the finished episode.|$|E
5|$|The {{first full}} day of filming on June 23 was {{predominantly}} shot on the set representing {{the bridge of the}} Enterprise. Two small establishing shots were postponed until the filming of the next episode. The following day, corridor scenes were filmed, as was the climactic scene featuring the creature's death. At that point, Daniels estimated that he was only a third of a day behind schedule. After a break for the weekend, production resumed on June 27 for scenes in the botany lab, the briefing room and sickbay. One of Grace Lee Whitney's favorite sets to work on throughout the series was the lab, which was the sickbay redecorated, as she enjoyed working with George Takei. The animated plant in <b>that</b> <b>scene</b> was a hand puppet controlled from under the table, and Whitney later recalled that the operator could see right up her skirt throughout the shoot and would occasionally try to grope her using the puppet.|$|E
5|$|The makeup for the Trill host {{featured}} a separate nose and forehead pieces, as the {{intention was to}} retain the general look of a human. Air bladders were placed inside a fake abdomen to create the shot in which the symbiont appeared to move under the host's skin. A second fake abdomen was created for the surgery scene in which the symbiont is moved into Riker, which worked by having a crew member lie under the surgery table, pulling the symbiont into the opening using a concealed string. The design of the symbiont {{was based on a}} caterpillar with an octopus for a head, which {{featured a}} further air bladder in order to give the appearance that it was pulsating and painted in fluorescent paint to glow when a black light was shone on it during <b>that</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E
5000|$|At {{a ballet}} premiere in November 2014, local media {{reported}} <b>that</b> one <b>scene</b> <b>that</b> contained {{images from the}} Cultural Revolution was cut; the production company blamed it on a [...] "technical error".|$|R
25|$|The 2000 film Lucky Numbers, {{starring}} John Travolta and Lisa Kudrow {{had multiple}} scenes shot throughout Palmyra. The {{main street of}} town was closed to traffic so <b>that</b> <b>scenes</b> could be shot. Dozens of onlookers watched Kudrow and Travolta cruise through the square in a red convertible.|$|R
50|$|On June 13, 2012, representatives for HGTV {{admitted}} <b>that</b> <b>scenes</b> {{featured in}} the original series House Hunters are mostly re-creations of prior events. In many cases, the final decision and purchase were made prior to filming. In some cases, homes visited were {{not even on the}} market.|$|R
5|$|With Homer having {{convinced}} Lisa {{that nothing}} can go wrong at Krusty's show, Lisa and Ralph go together. On live air, Krusty begins interviewing audience members, and Ralph takes the opportunity to declare that Lisa is {{the love of his}} life and that he intends to marry her in the future. Angry, Lisa snaps, stating that she had never liked him and that the only reason she gave him a Valentine was because nobody else would. Later at home, Bart takes the moment to replay <b>that</b> <b>scene</b> to Lisa in which Ralph is humiliated and deeply hurt. Lisa soon feels guilty and regrets her actions in hurting Ralph's feelings.|$|E
25|$|Each episode {{began with}} {{a shot of the}} {{building}} while audio from the previous episode's final scene could be heard. The shot would zoom in on the apartment in which <b>that</b> <b>scene</b> occurred, as the show's title was displayed. The vision would then switch to the scene in question as a recap of the previous episode's cliffhanger.|$|E
25|$|Lin-Manuel Miranda and Abrams contributed {{music to}} the film's cantina scene, similar to the Mos Eisley Cantina. Abrams met Miranda at a {{performance}} of his Broadway musical Hamilton, where Miranda jokingly offered to compose the cantina music, should it be needed. Unknown to Miranda, Williams had previously told Abrams {{that he did not}} want to compose the music for <b>that</b> <b>scene,</b> wanting to focus on the orchestral score for the film. Abrams then contacted Miranda, and the two began to collaborate on the music for the scene, over a period of two months.|$|E

6000|$|Nay: {{one there}} is to whom these things, That nobody else's mind calls back, Have a savour <b>that</b> <b>scenes</b> in being lack, And a {{presence}} more than the actual brings; To whom to-day is beneaped and stale, [...] And its urgent clack [...] But a vapid tale.|$|R
50|$|Screenwriter John Hodge {{has said}} that he {{primarily}} based his screenplay on Seven Deadly Sins, in addition to other journalism and affidavits from cyclists. Hodge says he ruled out using Armstrong's own accounts of his behavior during this period, and <b>that</b> <b>scenes</b> shown from Armstrong's perspective are fiction.|$|R
25|$|For {{the attack}} of the giant octopus, four live {{octopuses}} were used. The special-effects team was forced to move among the miniature huts by having hot air blown onto them. After the filming of <b>that</b> <b>scene</b> was finished, {{three of the four}} were released. The fourth became special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya's dinner. Along with the live animals, two rubber octopus props were built, with the larger one being covered with plastic wrap to simulate mucous. Some stop-motion tentacles were also created for the scene where the octopus grabs a native and tosses him.|$|E
25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – that if I did not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after <b>that</b> <b>scene</b> in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
25|$|Bill Krohn {{has noted}} that Bass's 48 story board panels for the scene {{introduced}} all the key aspects of the final shower murder scene – most notably, {{the fact that the}} attacker appears as a silhouette, close-ups of a slashing knife, the shower curtain torn down, a shot of the shower head from below, Marion's desperate outstretched arm, and the famous shot of the transition from the drain hole of the bathtub to Marion Crane's dead eye. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of Bass's iris titles for Vertigo. Krohn also concludes that Bass did not literally direct the shower scene, proving Hitchcock's presence on the set throughout the shooting of <b>that</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E
50|$|Renoir made {{a trip to}} Italy in 1881-82 and {{was deeply}} {{influenced}} by Renaissance art. After this trip he began to explore a new manner of painting, different from impressionism. He started to emphasize contours and modeling, abandoned the principle <b>that</b> <b>scenes</b> should be painted outdoors to capture light and atmosphere.|$|R
25|$|Over the years, some {{media reports}} have alleged <b>that</b> in certain <b>scenes</b> Kong was played by an actor wearing a gorilla suit. However, film historians are {{generally}} agreed <b>that</b> all <b>scenes</b> involving Kong were achieved with animated models.|$|R
