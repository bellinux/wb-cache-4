5|$|If {{the amount}} of current used exceeds the {{capability}} of the electrode, tungsten inclusions in the weld may result. Known as tungsten spitting, this can be identified with radiography and can be prevented by changing the type of electrode or increasing the electrode diameter. In addition, if the electrode is not well protected by the gas shield or the operator accidentally allows it <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> <b>the</b> molten metal, it can become dirty or contaminated. This often causes the welding arc to become unstable, requiring that the electrode be ground with a diamond abrasive to remove the impurity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. In 2010, the Government set out its commitment to establish a national non-emergency police number for England and Wales which would provide a single, memorable non-emergency number for <b>contacting</b> <b>the</b> police (101). This study reviewed {{the extent to which}} the 101 service was operating as intended in some of the first forces to implement 101. The study also examined call handling of non-emergency incidents more generally, including public perceptions and expectations of how non-emergency incidents should be dealt with. Interviews with national and local stakeholders as well as members of the public who had used the 101 service were undertaken. These were supplemented by focus groups with the public to understand wider attitudes <b>to</b> <b>contacting</b> <b>the</b> police. Main Topics : The main topics covered by this study include the following: implementation of the single non-emergency number for <b>contacting</b> <b>the</b> police (101); call handling of non-emergency incidents; public perceptions and expectations of how non-emergency incidents should be dealt with; views of national, local stakeholders and members of the public who had used the 101 service; public attitudes <b>to</b> <b>contacting</b> <b>the</b> police. </ul...|$|R

5|$|On Enterprise, {{analysis}} of data gathered in the previous encounter with the Romulan ship reveals that the ship is being piloted telepathically by an Andorian. Commander Shran (Jeffrey Combs) explains that the data indicates that the pilot is probably {{a member of the}} Aenar, a white-skinned and blind Andorian sub-race. This, however, seems unlikely, since the Aenar are few in number, reclusive pacifists, and inhabitants of the isolated extreme northern polar region of their moon. Shran and Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) then beam down <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> <b>the</b> Aenar. The Aenar's spokesperson, Lissan (Alicia Adams), initially declines to assist as the Aenar do not want to get involved in a war. However, a young Aenar named Jhamel (Alexandra Lydon) decides to help, since doing so may help locate Gareb (Scott Allen Rinker), her missing brother.|$|E
