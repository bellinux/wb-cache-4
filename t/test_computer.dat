Czarkoff {{reported that}} on his <b>test</b> <b>computer</b> {{a number of}} hardware problems surfaced, {{due to lack of}} free firmware. He said [...] "That effectively means that many devices are not supported in Parabola. Eg., after installing it on my Acer Aspire One 531h netbook I couldn't use my Broadcom bluetooth module and Intel's WiFi/WiMax Link 5150 adapter. (I still could use my HTC Magic with a custom Gingerbread ROM as a USB 3G/WiFi modem, though having something always connected to USB port is pretty annoying on laptop and specifically on netbook.)" [...] Czarkoff also criticized the lack of documentation available for Parabola. He concluded [...] "The overall impression of the Parabola GNU/Linux user experience exactly matches the one of Arch: a system with easy and flexible installation and configuration process and good choice of free software packages. Though the lack of documentation spoils the user experience, the Arch Linux resources can be used to further configure and extend the distribution. If my hardware would allow, I would probably stick with Parabola." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a versatile test facility developed by AECL for validation and reliability (V&R) testing of safety-critical software {{used in the}} process trip computers for CANDU 1 reactors. It describes the hardware and software aspects of the test facility. The test hardware consists of a test rig with a <b>test</b> <b>computer</b> used for executing the test software and a process trip computer emulator. The test software is comprised of an operating system, a test interpreter, a test oracle, and a man-machine interface. This paper also discusses {{the application of the}} test facility in V&R testing of the process trip computer, how test scripts are prepared and automatically run on the <b>test</b> <b>computer,</b> and how test results are automatically generated by the <b>test</b> <b>computer,</b> thus eliminating potential human errors. The test scripts, which contain specific instructions for testing, are text files written in a special AECL test language. An AECL Test Language Interpreter (ATLIN) program interprets the test scripts and translates structured English statements in the test scripts into test actions. The intuitive nature of the special AECL test language, the version controlled test scripts in text format and automatic test logging feature facilitate the preparation of test cases, which are easy to repeat, review and readily modifiable, and production of consistent results. This paper presents the concept of adding a process trip computer emulator for use in preparation of V&R testing. The process trip computer emulator is designed independently from the actual process trip computer but based on the same functional specification as for the process trip computer. The use of the process trip computer emulator allows the test scripts to be exercised before the actual process trip computers are 1 CANDU is a registered trade-mark of Atomic Energy of Canada Limite...|$|E
