5|$|A letter dated 26 September 1985 {{from the}} {{assistant}} director of public prosecutions who prepared the case against Bamber suggests that Mugford not be prosecuted for the burglary, the cheque fraud, and for a further offence of selling cannabis. She subsequently testified against Bamber during his trial in October 1986. The judge <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that they could convict Bamber on Mugford's testimony alone. Immediately after the verdict was announced, Mugford sold her story to the News of the World for ₤25,000 (£ in 2016).|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{a little}} after noon Wilton arrived at the inquest, and gave a full account of the incident. Lord Granville (half-brother of the Marquess of Stafford) <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that Huskisson had been {{suffering}} from numbness in his leg from a previous operation, and that this may have caused his apparent problems with movement. No witnesses recollected seeing any signal flags raised {{from any of the}} locomotives involved, including Rocket, although a system of warning flags {{was supposed to have been}} in place.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} witnesses, {{including}} Hannah Cox, {{testified to the}} events of the evening of 26 May and of the following morning. The first witnesses to attract significant cross-examination by William Reader, Thornton's barrister, were the two factory workers, William Lavell and Joseph Bird, who had matched Thornton's shoes to the footprints in the harrowed field. Under cross-examination, both admitted that it had rained heavily between the time the footprints were made and the time they attempted to match the prints. Constable Dales <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that Thornton admitted having sex with Ashford before he was searched: that is, before his bloodstained clothing came to light. Mr Freer, a Birmingham surgeon who conducted the post-mortem, testified as to its results, and stated that except for the vaginal lacerations, there were no signs of violence on Ashford's person, and that those cuts could have been caused by consensual sexual relations. Freer's testimony concluded the prosecution case, and as the defendant declined to exercise his right to himself make a statement to the court, the defence began calling witnesses.|$|E
25|$|On April 6, 1970, a Dukes County {{grand jury}} {{assembled}} in special session to investigate Kopechne's death. Judge Wilfred Paquet instructed {{the members of}} <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> that they could consider only matters brought to their attention by the superior court, the district attorney, or their own personal knowledge. Citing the orders of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Paquet <b>told</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> {{that it could not}} see the evidence or Boyle's report from the inquest, which were still impounded. Dinis, who had attended the inquest and seen Boyle's report, <b>told</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> that there was not enough evidence to indict Kennedy on potential charges of manslaughter, perjury or driving to endanger. <b>The</b> grand <b>jury</b> called four witnesses who had not testified at the inquest: they testified for a total of 20 minutes, but no indictments were issued.|$|R
40|$|Script {{from the}} WBAP-TV/NBC station in Fort Worth, Texas, {{covering}} {{a news story}} about Former Sansom Park police chief Lee Rennels was charged and indicted for assault and battery after Lyn Decker <b>told</b> <b>the</b> Grand <b>Jury</b> Rennels beat him with his fists and a night stick, he was later found innocent of the charges...|$|R
25|$|Michael Chang, {{who with}} another friend later {{attempted}} to find <b>the</b> gun, <b>told</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> that Markhasev {{told him he}} killed Cosby. He recounted that Markhasev told him that Cosby was frightened when he pulled the gun and demanded money, and that Markhasev shot Cosby because he was taking too long to give him money.|$|R
5|$|On 18 March 1889, Bury was arraigned for {{the murder}} of his wife; he entered a plea of not guilty. The trial was seen before Lord Young in the High Court of Justiciary on 28 March. Bury's defence team {{comprised}} solicitor David Tweedie and advocate William Hay; the prosecution was led by advocate depute Dugald or Dill McKechnie. The hearing lasted 13 hours. The prosecution witnesses included Ellen's sister Margaret Corney, William's former employer James Martin, the Burys' London landlady Elizabeth Haynes, William's drinking partner David Walker, Lieutenant Lamb and Drs Templeman and Littlejohn. After a break for supper, Hay presented the defence case, which was heavily dependent on Dr Lennox's testimony that Ellen had strangled herself. At 10:05p.m., Lord Young finished his summation, and the jury of 15 men retired to consider their verdict. After 25 minutes, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty with a recommendation for mercy. Lord Young asked the jury why they recommended mercy, and one of them replied that the medical evidence was contradictory, referring to Lennox's testimony. Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty, and the jury may have been trying to avoid passing a death sentence. Young <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> to retire and reconsider their verdict until they were decided by the evidence one way or another. At 10:40p.m., they returned with a unanimous verdict of guilty. Lord Young passed the mandatory sentence for murder: death by hanging.|$|E
25|$|The judge wrongly <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> {{that the}} {{provocation}} can also {{come from a}} third person.|$|E
25|$|His defence {{was led by}} Mr Serjeant William Shee. The defence case {{suffered}} adverse {{comment from}} the judge because Shee had, against all rules and conventions of professional conduct, <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that he personally believed Palmer to be innocent.|$|E
50|$|At the Wexford assize in 1897 he {{expressed}} his horror at the brutal murder of James Kelly, a well to do farmer from Kilcavan, the previous month. He <b>told</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> {{that he would}} not comment on the case in detail since there had been no arrest. In fact no arrest was ever made and the murder remains unsolved to this day.|$|R
5|$|Despite her confession, Wise {{pleaded not}} guilty to the charge of murdering Lily Gienke in front of a grand jury on March 23, 1925. She <b>told</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> that she was irresistibly {{attracted}} to attending funerals, and that when there were not enough funerals in the community, she was driven to create them by killing. Wise was indicted on a charge of first-degree murder on April 7, 1925.|$|R
2500|$|There was {{evidence}} that Brawley's mother and King participated knowingly in <b>the</b> hoax. Neighbors <b>told</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> that in February they overheard Glenda Brawley saying to King, [...] "You shouldn't have took the money because after it all comes out, they're {{going to find out}} the truth." [...] Another neighbor heard Mrs. Brawley say, [...] "They know we're lying and they're going to find out and come and get us." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{prosecution}} <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> {{in closing}} arguments that Fuhrman was a racist, {{but said that}} this should not detract from the factual evidence that showed Simpson's guilt. Fuhrman's testimony resulted in his indictment on one count of perjury; he later pleaded no contest.|$|E
25|$|The defense {{also noted}} that all four men had been ruled out as the {{originator}} of a palmprint found on Holly's car, while another suspect, Terry Britt, could not be excluded. Former TBI agent Terry Dicus, who was the lead investigator on the case, testified for the defense. He <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that he ruled the men out early in the case because their alibis checked out and cell phone records put Zach and Holly several miles apart during the critical time frame.|$|E
25|$|The defense {{arguments}} {{began on}} October 20 with Barbra Schultz, the hotel's General Manager, taking the stand. Tinker asked if Selena had actually screamed {{out to them}} to lock the doors. She replied that Selena had never asked for the doors to be locked and was only moaning on the floor. Schultz further stated that her former employee, Vela, was not trustworthy. Schultz also said that all the employees began formulating different opinions on what happened on March 31 when the prosecution called on them to testify. Motel staff maid, Gloria Magaña, doubted the validity of Espinoza and Martinez's accounts. She <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> {{that it was impossible}} for both employees to have seen Saldívar chasing Selena because their work {{was on the other side}} of the motel building. Magaña claimed to have seen Selena running through the parking lot, but did not see Saldívar chasing after her. Tinker called Marilyn Greer, Selena's seventh grade teacher, to the stand. She <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that Selena had had the ability to graduate with honors and could have easily obtained a college scholarship. Greer then spoke about how Quintanilla, Jr. had taken away the possibility of college for Selena, wasting her youth by forcing her to sing at nightclubs and bars for money; something that was unhealthy for a thirteen-year-old girl.|$|E
50|$|Cochran did not {{represent}} Simpson in the subsequent civil trial for the same murders; Simpson was found liable for the deaths. Cochran was criticized during the criminal trial by pundits, {{as well as by}} prosecutor Christopher Darden, for suggesting that the police were trying to frame Simpson because they were racist. Cochran <b>told</b> <b>the</b> majority-black <b>jury</b> that police officers were trying to frame Simpson because of his race.|$|R
50|$|Despite her confession, Wise {{pleaded not}} guilty to the charge of murdering Lily Gienke in front of a grand jury on March 23, 1925.

5000|$|In late November and December 1948, Levine's name hit {{newspapers}} {{as he was}} subpoenaed {{to testify}} publicly and privately. He did not enjoy the publicity at all: he <b>told</b> <b>the</b> Grand <b>Jury</b> he was [...] "pretty put out because the day before they had mentioned about spy papers and I found myself, an innocent pawn, in this thing. How do you think I feel? How do you think I feel now?" ...|$|R
25|$|Stone sued {{his former}} {{managers}} in 2010, {{accusing them of}} cheating him out of years' worth of royalty payments for the songs he had written. He testified {{that he had not}} been paid any royalties between 1989 and 2009. A jury in Los Angeles awarded him $5 million in damages in January 2015, but in December the award was overturned because, the appellate court ruled, the trial judge had not <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> {{to take into account the}} fact Stone had assigned his royalties to a production company in exchange for a 50% ownership stake. In May 2016, Stone's attorneys appealed that decision.|$|E
25|$|On 7 March 2012, a {{forensic}} pathologist, Dr Nathaniel Cary <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that David Gilroy had curved scratches {{on his hands}} a cut on his forehead, bruises {{on his chest and}} other scratches to his hands, wrist and forearms on 6 May 2010. A series of photographs were produced in court (left). He told the advocate depute that the scratches could have been caused by another person's fingernails, possibly in a struggle, and that this had happened around the time Ms Pilley went missing. He also said that the injuries were consistent with what he had seen previously in cases involving strangulation, but that it was difficult to tell because the injuries had been covered with a make-up like substance. Under cross-examination Dr Cary confirmed that the scratches on Gilroy's hands could have come from gardening activities.|$|E
25|$|On 1 June 2005 it was {{announced}} that an inquest into the crash would be held at the Guildhall in Windsor, Berkshire. The inquest was expected to last 12 days, starting on 17 October 2005. A delay ensued over whether {{the families of the victims}} should be granted legal aid. The inquest finally began in October 2007. A policeman who had witnessed the crash, PC Brazier, testified at the inquest. He <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that he believed the crash was caused by a suicide attempt. The Forensic Accident Investigator, David Price, told the inquest that he had been able to determine that the car had been parked on the level crossing with its engine switched off, the handbrake fully applied, the vehicle's lights switched off, the steering on a partial left-hand turn (which was not consistent with driving across the crossing), and that its fuel tank still contained at least 8 litres (about 2 gallons) of petrol.|$|E
5000|$|There was {{evidence}} that Brawley's mother and King participated knowingly in <b>the</b> hoax.

60|$|It was {{not very}} long, hardly {{more than a quarter}} of an hour, before <b>the</b> knock which <b>told</b> that <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> had come to their {{decision}} fell as a signal for silence on every ear. It is sublime--that sudden pause of a great multitude which tells that one soul moves in them all. Deeper and deeper the silence seemed to become, like the deepening night, while the jurymen's names were called over, and the prisoner was made to hold up her hand, and <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> were asked for their verdict.|$|R
25|$|In {{his grand}} jury testimony, Rove testified {{he learned of}} Plame's CIA {{affiliation}} from journalists and not from government officials. Rove testified that Novak called him in July 2003 to discuss a story unrelated to Plame or Wilson. Eventually, according to Rove, Novak told him he planned to report in an upcoming column that Plame worked for <b>the</b> CIA. Rove <b>told</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> that by <b>the</b> time Novak had called him, he had already learned of Plame from other reporters, but {{that he could not}} recall which reporters had told him. When Novak inquired about Wilson's wife working for the CIA, Rove indicated he had heard something like that, according to the source's recounting of <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> testimony for <b>the</b> Associated Press. Rove <b>told</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> that three days later, he had a phone conversation with Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper and, in an effort to discredit some of Wilson's allegations, informally told Cooper that he believed Wilson's wife worked for the CIA, though he never used her name. Rove also testified to <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> that he had heard from Libby that Plame worked for the CIA. Rove testified that Libby told him that he heard the information from journalists.|$|R
25|$|Exxon {{recovered}} {{a significant portion}} of clean-up and legal expenses through insurance claims associated with the grounding of the Exxon Valdez. Also, in 1991, Exxon made a quiet, separate financial settlement of damages with a group of seafood producers known as the Seattle Seven for the disaster's effect on the Alaskan seafood industry. The agreement granted $63.75million to the Seattle Seven, but stipulated that the seafood companies would have to repay almost all of any punitive damages awarded in other civil proceedings. The $5billion in punitive damages was awarded later, and the Seattle Seven's share could have been as high as $750million if the damages award had held. Other plaintiffs have objected to this secret arrangement, and when it came to light, Judge Holland ruled that Exxon should have <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> at the start that an agreement had already been made, so the jury would know exactly how much Exxon would have to pay.|$|E
25|$|Cicero’s {{case was}} divided into three parts. The first part {{detailed}} exactly the charge brought by Ericius. Cicero explained how a rustic son of a farmer, who lives off the pleasures of his own land, would not have gained anything from committing patricide because he would have eventually inherited his father's land anyway. The second part concerned the boldness and greed {{of two of the}} accusers, Magnus and Capito. Cicero <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that they were the more likely perpetrators of murder because the two were greedy, both for conspiring together against a fellow kinsman and, in particular, Magnus, for his boldness and for being unashamed to appear in court to support the false charges. The third part explained that Chrysogonus had immense political power, and the accusation was successfully made due to that power. Even though Chrysogonus may not have been what Cicero said he was, through rhetoric Cicero successfully made him appear to be a foreign freed man who prospered by devious means {{in the aftermath of the}} civil war. Cicero surmised that it showed what kind of a person he was and that something like murder was not beneath him.|$|E
500|$|Frick <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> {{about the}} attempt on his life. The clothes he wore that day, bloody and riddled with holes, {{were shown to}} the jury. A {{physician}} testified that both of Berkman's weapons, the gun and the dagger, could have caused death. Leishman testified that Berkman fired his pistol at him once and Berkman asked, [...] "Well, did I intend to kill you?" [...] "I think so", Leishman replied, to which Berkman said, [...] "Well that's not true. I didn't intend to do it." [...] Several witnesses <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that Berkman had visited the Carnegie offices three times. Berkman's dagger and gun were placed into evidence, and the prosecution rested.|$|E
60|$|But {{it was not}} fated that Lady Mason {{should be}} sent away from the court in doubt. At eight o'clock Mr. Aram came to them, hot with haste, and <b>told</b> them that <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> had sent for the judge. The judge had gone home to his dinner, but would return to court at once when he heard that <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> had agreed.|$|R
5000|$|Schneiderhan {{was called}} to testify before Grand Jury {{corruption}} hearings because {{of his relationship with}} Flemmi and the Winter Hill Gang. In letters to his son Eric, he had written that if he ever got into a jam with the law he should contact [...] "Paul". When Eric <b>told</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> he wasn't sure if [...] "Paul" [...] was his father's code name for Flemmi, he was indicted for perjury, but found not guilty at trial.|$|R
2500|$|Donald Parker, {{photographer}} for the Los Angeles Examiner, who was present during <b>the</b> raid, <b>told</b> <b>the</b> coroner's <b>jury</b> {{that he had}} been a member of the Klan for several months but resigned after April 22. R.B. (or R.D.) Knickerbocker, an Examiner reporter, was also present. Parker said he had been [...] "tipped off," [...] possibly by Klan kleagle N.A. Baker, and Knickerbocker said he could not escape from the klansman who was guarding him after he learned of the action that was to take place.|$|R
500|$|In his summing up, Judge Channell {{commented that}} the acts of the {{defendant}} in hiding the gun and fleeing Eastbourne [...] "were acts which a guilty man would be very likely to do." [...] He also <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that, while there was no direct evidence linking Williams to the murder, many cases had resulted in a conviction with even less evidence. [...] After around fifteen minutes of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict of guilty, and Channell sentenced Williams to death.|$|E
500|$|Lord Alverstone <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> {{that the}} case was an {{important}} one of national interest. He called The Shambles of Science [...] "hysterical", but advised the jury not to be swayed by arguments {{about the validity of}} vivisection. After retiring for 25 minutes on 18 November 1903, the jury unanimously found that Bayliss had been defamed, to the applause of physicians in the public gallery. Bayliss was awarded £2,000 with £3,000 costs; Coleridge gave him a cheque the next day.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial of}} the eight {{soldiers}} opened on November 27, 1770. Adams <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> {{to look beyond the}} fact the soldiers were British. He argued that if the soldiers were endangered by the mob, which he called [...] "a motley rabble of saucy boys, negroes, and molattoes, Irish teagues and outlandish jack tarrs [...] ", they had the legal right to fight back, and so were innocent. If they were provoked but not endangered, he argued, they were at most guilty of manslaughter.|$|E
50|$|Benyamin was {{a primary}} school pupil as his brother Mehmet {{studied at the}} {{conservatory}} in Ankara. Mehmet listened to classical music at home {{when he was on}} vacation. Once, Benyamin was very impressed by the music of Shostakovich, which his brother listened to at home. Mehmet, noticing his brother's interest in classical music, took him to Ankara. At the age of 13, Benyamin took an admission test for the conservatory at the Hacettepe University. He failed the test and his brother was <b>told</b> by <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that Benyamin was not talented for music.|$|R
5000|$|Atkins <b>told</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> {{that she}} stabbed Frykowski {{in the legs}} and held Tate down while Watson stabbed her. She also testified that Tate had pleaded for her life and that of her unborn child, to which Atkins replied, [...] "Woman, I have no mercy for you." [...] Her {{explanation}} to <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> {{was that this was}} talking to (convince) herself, and not addressed to Tate as, [...] "I was told before we even got there no matter what they beg don't give them any leeway". She also denied her earlier statement to Howard and Graham that she had tasted Tate's blood.|$|R
2500|$|In {{an account}} by NBC News {{reporter}} Tracy Connor an anonymous juror stated that when <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> first <b>told</b> <b>the</b> judge it was deadlocked, on June 15, the {{votes on the}} three counts were 7–5, 5–7, and 5–6 with one abstention. Two days later, the vote {{on one of the}} counts was 10–2, but then several jurors changed their minds, making it a more even split again. It was described as a 'true deadlock'. On June 23, a juror <b>told</b> CNN that <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> deadlock was caused in large part by confusion over the contradicting statements made by Andrea Constand during testimony. The juror, speaking anonymously, also stated that the prosecution presented [...] "no real new evidence".|$|R
