5|$|A snow groomer is {{a machine}} {{designed}} to smooth and compact <b>the</b> <b>snow,</b> rather than removing it altogether. Early snow groomers {{were used by}} residents of rural areas to compress <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> close to their homes, and consisted of a heavy roller hauled by oxen which compacted <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> to make a smooth surface for sledging. With {{the invention of the}} motor car, snow groomers were replaced by snowplows and snow blowers on public thoroughfares, but remained in use at ski resorts, where they are used to maintain smooth, safe trails for various wintersports, including skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling. Snow groomers remained unchanged throughout the 20th century, with most consisting of heavy roller which could be attached to a tractor or snowcat and then hauled across the area to be groomed.|$|E
5|$|It {{also has}} a more {{extensive}} classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> pack {{and the formation of}} ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.|$|E

5|$|Over 2,500 {{species of}} fleas have been {{described}} worldwide. The Siphonaptera are most closely related to <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> scorpionflies (Boreidae), placing them within the endopterygote insect order Mecoptera.|$|E
5|$|Ski wax {{enhances the}} ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the {{properties}} of <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over <b>the</b> <b>snow.</b>|$|E

5|$|While Marge and the {{children}} are enjoying dinner, Homer begins pursuing the family with an axe and Bart uses his powers to call Willie, who immediately runs to the family's rescue, abandoning his portable television in <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> in the process. Homer kills him by striking {{him in the back}} with the axe. Homer pursues his family outside but as he is about to kill them, Lisa discovers Willie's abandoned television. Homer's insanity gradually decreases and the family freezes in <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> as they are watching.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the harsh}} winter conditions, the station area was {{gradually}} built with snow tunnels to keep <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> off the tracks. This included the platforms {{and most of}} the passing loop at the station. In 1914–15, the station serviced 398 passengers, and in 1919–20, it serviced 684 passengers, both times making it the least used station on the line. In 1948, the western part of <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> tunnel caught fire, and although it spread to the station building, it was quickly put out by the staff. In 1953, there was again a fire in the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Blizzard {{conditions}} were reported across {{most of the}} Midwest from Illinois to Ohio. Numerous flights were canceled due to <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> and ice across various airports including in Toronto, Ottawa, Quebec City, Montreal, Kansas City, Indianapolis, St. Louis, Cleveland, Boston and Cincinnati. 900 flights were canceled at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.|$|E

5|$|Cores {{are often}} drilled {{in areas such}} as Antarctica and central Greenland where the {{temperature}} is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter <b>the</b> <b>snow.</b> In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow sublimate, leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and hoar frost forms on the top layer. Buried under <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{additional}} heavy snowfall, New York Governor Eliot Spitzer {{called in the}} National Guard to assist in <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> removal efforts in the areas hit by the lake effect snow storm.|$|E
5|$|In New Jersey, {{increasing}} winds caused blowing and drifting of <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> {{and led to}} near-blizzard conditions. Behind the storm, {{very cold}} and gusty weather lingered. New Jersey Transit shut down bus service in northern portions of the state, and rail lines had 20-minute delays. Most injuries in the state were related to physical strain while shoveling, snow blower accidents or slips and falls. As the snowfall was of a light nature, few trees limbs and electrical wires were downed by the storm. GPU Energy reported only around 5,500 power outages. A countywide state of emergency was declared in Sussex County, as vehicles were sliding off roadways. Several other traffic accidents and delays were reported throughout the state, and in Somerset County, a few roads were closed due to <b>the</b> <b>snow.</b> A Red Cross shelter was opened for residents of a Spotswood trailer park.|$|E

5|$|Stealing a Ride follows two children, Susie Gay and Johnnie Eddy, {{who are out}} tobogganing on sleds. The two see Susie's parents {{going out}} for a drive in a sleigh and ask to come along. The parents refuse and {{secretly}} two hitch their sleds behind the sleigh. When going up a hill, Susie loses her grip on her sled and Johnnie tries to save her from falling in vain. The two fall off and are unable to catch up the sleigh. The children wander into the woods and become lost. When Susie's parents discover the empty sleds they turn back and track down the children by the footprints they left in <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> {{with the aid of a}} dog. The parents find them asleep in <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> and bring them back home in the sleigh. The children are punished by spanking and then kissed by their parents for their actions.|$|E
