60|$|The Wizard, when he {{returned}} to his own room, was exceedingly thoughtful. He had no doubt Eureka had eaten his piglet, but he realized that a kitten cannot be depended upon at all times to act properly, since its nature is to destroy small animals and even birds for food, and the <b>tame</b> <b>cat</b> that we keep in our houses today is descended from the wild cat of the jungle--a very ferocious creature, indeed.

5|$|Cats {{have either}} a mutualistic or {{commensal}} relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately <b>tamed</b> <b>cats</b> {{in a process}} of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for such an effort may have been too little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|R

6000|$|There {{was ever}} present to her mind {{an idea of}} failure and a fear lest she had been mistaken in her views {{throughout}} her life. No one had ever been more devoted to peculiar opinions, or more strong {{in the use of}} language for their expression; and she was so far true to herself, that she would never seem to retreat from the position she had taken. She would still scorn the new fangles of the world around her, and speak of the changes which she saw as all tending to evil. But, through it all, there was an idea present to herself that it could not be God's intention that things should really change for the worse, and that the fault must be in her, because she had been unable to move as others had moved. She would sit thinking of the circumstances of her own life and tell herself that with her everything had failed. She had loved, but had quarrelled with her lover; and her love had come to nothing--but barren wealth. She had fought for her wealth and had conquered;--and had become hard in the fight, and was conscious of her own hardness. In the early days of her riches and power she had taken her nephew by the hand,--and had thrown him away from her because he would not dress himself in her mirror. She had believed herself to be right, and would not, even now, tell herself that she had been wrong; but there were doubts, and qualms of conscience, and an uneasiness,--because her life had been a failure. Now she was seeking to appease her self-accusations by sacrificing everything for the happiness of her niece and her chosen hero; but as she went on with the work she felt that all would be in vain, unless she could sweep herself altogether from off the scene. She had told herself that if she could bring Brooke to Exeter, his prospects would be made infinitely brighter than they would be in London, and that she in her last days would not be left utterly alone. But as the prospect of her future life came nearer to her, she saw, or thought that she saw, that there was still failure before her. Young people would not want an old woman in the house with them;--even though the old woman would declare that she would be no more in the house than a <b>tame</b> <b>cat.</b> And she knew herself also too well to believe that she could make herself a <b>tame</b> <b>cat</b> in the home that had so long been subject to her dominion.

50|$|The house {{soon became}} noted for the {{successful}} domestic drama-comedies by Thomas William Robertson, including his series of groundbreaking realist plays, Society (1865), Ours (1866), Caste (1867), Play (1868), School (1869), and M.P. (1870). In 1867, Miss Wilton became Mrs. Bancroft and regularly took the principal female parts in these pieces opposite her husband. Other plays were W. S.

6000|$|It will be {{the same}} if we compare the {{conditions}} that have come about with the Revolution legend touching publicity. The old democratic doctrine was that the more light that was let in to all departments of State, the easier it was for a righteous indignation to move promptly against wrong. In other words, monarchs were to live in glass houses, that mobs might throw stones. Again, no admirer of existing English politics (if there is any admirer of existing English politics) will really pretend that this ideal of publicity is exhausted, or even attempted. Obviously public life grows more private every day. The French have, indeed, continued the tradition of revealing secrets and making scandals; hence they are more flagrant and palpable than we, not in sin but in the confession of sin. The first trial of Dreyfus might have happened in England; it is exactly the second trial that would have been legally impossible. But, indeed, if we wish to realise how far we fall short of the original republican outline, the sharpest way to test it is to note how far we fall short even of the republican element in the older regime. Not only are we less democratic than Danton and Condorcet, but we are in many ways less democratic than Choiseul and Marie Antoinette. The richest nobles before the revolt were needy middle-class people compared with our Rothschilds and Roseberys. And in the matter of publicity the old French monarchy was infinitely more democratic than any of the monarchies of today. Practically anybody who chose could walk into the palace and see the king playing with his children, or paring his nails. The people possessed the monarch, as the people possess Primrose Hill; that is, they cannot move it, but they can sprawl all over it. The old French monarchy was founded on the excellent principle that a cat may look at a king. But nowadays a cat may not look at a king; unless it is a very <b>tame</b> <b>cat.</b> Even where the press is free for criticism it is only used for adulation. The substantial difference comes to something uncommonly like this: Eighteenth century tyranny meant that you could say [...] "The K of Brrd is a profligate." [...] Twentieth century liberty really means that you are allowed to say [...] "The King of Brentford is a model family man." ...|$|E

40|$|Domestic cats (Felis catus) {{were first}} brought to Hawai‘i aboard sailing ships of European explorers and colonists. The job of these predators was to control {{mice and rats}} on the ships during the long voyages.

But cats have always been very well equipped to live and hunt on their own.

Although the details of when cats first came {{to live in the}} wild remain little known, adventurers, writers, and naturalists of the day recorded some important observations. Feral cats were observed in remote wilderness around Kīlauea volcano on Hawai‘i Island as early as 1840 by explorer William Brackenridge.

A trap-test-vaccinate-alter-return-monitor (TTVARM) program was implemented on the Texas A&M University campus in August 1998 to manage the feral cat population. Results of the program were summarized for the period August 1998 - April 2000. Cats were humanely trapped once a month. In surgery laboratories, senior veterinary students examined the cats, tested them for feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus infections, vaccinated, and surgically neutered the cats. Cats testing positive for either disease were euthanized. Cats were returned to their capture sites and maintained in managed colonies, in which volunteers provided food and observed the <b>cats.</b> Captured <b>tame</b> <b>cats</b> and kittens were placed for adoption. A total of 150 cats were captured. The population had approximately a 1 : 1 male to female ratio. The majority of cats were young adults. The proportion of kittens caught was significantly less in year 2 than in year 1. The prevalence found for feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus infections was 5. 4 % and 6. 8 %, respectively. The number of <b>tame</b> <b>cats</b> trapped was significantly greater in year 2 than in year 1. In the surgery laboratories, 112 cats were neutered. Ninety-nine cats were returned to campus following surgery. Approximately one-third of the cats due for their annual vaccinations were recaptured and revaccinated. Twenty-seven kittens and tame adults were placed for adoption. An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to the TAMU veterinary class of 1999 to evaluate their attitudes regarding feral cat issues and their response to participation in the feral cat surgery laboratories. Sixty percent of the students responded that they had participated in the laboratories. Of these, a majority found them beneficial. With regard to the best method for managing feral cats, 77 % chose TTVAR. Eighty-three percent of the students would be willing to work on feral cats in practice, and a majority of these would be willing to participate in and promote the development of TTVAR programs. Sixty-five percent of the students believed that feral cats posed some risk to public health. Significantly more students had the view that feral cats definitely have an impact on wildlife as compared to free-roaming, owned cats...|$|R
