25|$|<b>The</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> for cued recall {{increases}} systematically {{with the}} number of trials completed. This result has caused a debate about whether or not learning is all-or-none. One theory is that learning is incremental and that the recall of each word pair is strengthened with repetition. Another theory suggests that learning is all-or-none, that is one learns the word pair in a single trial and memory performance is due to the average learned pairs, some of which are learned on earlier trials and some on later trials. To examine the validity of these theories researchers have performed memory experiments. In one experiment published in 1959, experimental psychologist Irvin Rock and colleague Walter Heimer of the University of Illinois had both a control group and an experimental group learn pairs of words. The control group studied word pairs that were repeated until the participants learned all the word pairs. In the experimental group, the learned pairs remained in the list while unlearned pairs were substituted with recombinations of previous words. Rock believed that associations between two items would be strengthened if learning were incremental even when pairs are not correctly recalled. His hypothesis was that the control group would have a higher correct recall probability than the experimental group. He thought that repetition would increase the strength of the word pair until the strength reaches a threshold needed to produce an overt response. If learning were all or none, then the control group and the experimental group should learn the word pairs at the same rate. Rock found experimentally there was little difference in learning rates between the two groups. However, Rock's work did not settle the controversy because in his experiment he rearranged replaced word pairs that could be either easier or harder to learn than the original words in the word- digit pair. In further experiments that addressed the question, there were mixed results. The incremental learning hypothesis is supported by the notion that awhile after Ai-Bi pairs are learned, the recall time to recall Bi decreases with continued learning trails.|$|E
500|$|While the {{majority}} of reviewers gave Dota 2 highly positive reviews, a common criticism was that the game maintains a steep learning curve that requires exceptional commitment to overcome. While providing a moderately positive review that praised Valve's product stability, Fredrik Ã…slund from the Swedish division of Gamereactor described his first match of Dota 2 {{as one of the}} most humiliating and inhospitable experiences of his gaming career, citing <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> and players' attitudes as unwelcoming. Benjamin Danneberg of GameStar alluded to <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> as a [...] "learning cliff", calling the newcomer's experience to be painful, with the tutorial feature new to the Dota franchise only being partially successful. In a review for the Metro newspaper, Dota 2 was criticized for not compensating for the flaws with <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> from Defense of the Ancients, as well as the sometimes hostile community, which is commonly criticized in multiplayer online battle arena games. Peter Bright of Ars Technica also directed criticism at the ability for third-party websites to allow skin gambling and betting on match results, similar to [...] with Valve's [...] Using Dota 2 as an example, Bright thought that Valve had built gambling elements directly into their games, and had issues with the unregulated practice, which he stated was often used by underage players and regions where gambling is illegal. Australian senator Nick Xenophon had similar sentiment, stating that he wanted to introduce legislation in his country to minimize underage access to gambling within video games, including Dota 2. In response to the controversy, Valve and Dota 2 project manager, Erik Johnson, stated that they would be taking action against the third-party sites, saying that the practice was not allowed by their API or their user agreements.|$|E

Critics pointed out the strength of the game within its gameplay, character development, and visual representation. GameSpot noted that <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> is easily grasped, and that the ability system is not as complex as in Final Fantasy VII or Final Fantasy VIII. Each player character possesses unique abilities, which hinders the development of an over-powered character. GameSpot describes the battle system as having a tactical nature and notes that the expanded party allows for more interaction between players and between enemies. Nevertheless, IGN disliked the lengthy combat pace and the repeated battles, describing it as [...] "aggravating", and RPGFan felt the Trance system to be ineffective as the meter buildup is slow and unpredictable, with characters Trancing just before the enemy is killed.|$|E

It received a more positive reception in Japan than elsewhere, something which the developers credit to different styles of reviewing between cultures. They also felt that the Japanese reviewers scored the game too high. It received a 38/40 from Famitsu magazine; the review praises the battle system for its unique, massive-scale battles reminiscent of Romancing SaGa but refined to a wholly new class; however, they criticized <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> as well, the length of battles, and the inability to choose specific skills for individual units.

500|$|DJ Hero has {{received}} positive reviews from the gaming press, who consider the title as a fresh restart {{of the music}} genre given {{the large number of}} titles based on guitar play. The turntable peripheral was considered to be well designed {{to meet the needs of}} the game. The unit's weight, size, and shape, and ability to cater to both left- and right-handed players was commended. Many reviewers noted a need to alter the action of the crossfader, either by having better physical feedback to the player to indicate the center of the knob's track, or by reducing the width of the track to better handle the rapid crossfade maneuvers. Reviewers also noted that there was a certain weight to the turntable portion of the controller which made scratching imprecise, particularly with the inner blue button where only minimal torque can be applied. <b>The</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> of the game across the various mixes was highly commended by reviewers for helping players to get used to the new controller. When progressing from [...] "Medium" [...] to [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Expert" [...] levels and encountering more complex mixes, reviewers thought the game felt transformed, bringing a difficult but more rewarding experience to the player as they begin emulating every part of a real DJ's motions. Johnny Minkley of Eurogamer considered that while <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> is steep, with the [...] "Easy" [...] difficulty being [...] "less thrilling and engaging" [...] compared to Guitar Hero, the game was [...] "structured fabulously to nudge you gradually closer to the summit" [...] with each successive career set and difficulty mode. Cam Shae of IGN Australia felt that the changes in [...] "Hard" [...] mode over [...] "Medium" [...] were somewhat excessive, introducing both more crossfade effects and button-pressing, and felt these could have been introduced separately in [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Expert" [...] modes. [...] Richard Li of 1UP.com noted that the inability to fail a song is both [...] "a bane and a boon"; newer players would not feel frustration at trying to get used to the controller and would be able to quickly unlock all the sets in the game's career mode, but without knowing where they failed, they would not have an idea of where they need to hone their skills to improve their performance at the game. The omission of a practice mode was noted by Daemon Hatfield of IGN, believing it would help in some of the more complex mixes by the DJ celebrities. Reviewers believed that the small faults in DJ Hero can be easily fixed for potential sequels.|$|E

Although they appealed to gamers who, like Pro-G's Struan Robertson, wanted a [...] "bloody hard, but also bloody good" [...] challenge, it was feared that casual gamers would find <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> daunting. IGN warned that gamers with lesser skills might not [...] "get as much out of this game as others due to [...] incredible difficulty", and Edge commented that [...] "Tecmoâ€™s refusal to extend any kind of handhold to less dedicated players is simply a failure of design, not a badge of hardcore honour" [...] and [...] "itâ€™s impossible to believe they couldnâ€™t {{have found a way}} to increase the accessibility of the game without undermining the gloriously intractable nature of the challenges it contains." [...] EGM found the challenge to be [...] "rewarding" [...] as it [...] "motivates you to actually get better at the game." [...] Clive Thompson focused on Ninja Gaiden in his Slate article examining the motivation for playing difficult games. He contends that extreme levels of challenge can be initially very frustrating and may cause a game to be abandoned in disgust. However, where a game also rewards a player's perseverance by teaching the skills required to overcome its challenges, that player will have the motivation to finish the game. Ninja Gaiden, in his opinion, strikes the correct balance between challenge and reward; completion brings [...] "a sort of exhausted exhilaration, like finally reaching the end of War and Peace." [...] In 2012, CraveOnline included it on their list of five [...] "badass ninja games", calling it [...] "the pinnacle of action gaming at the time, holding onto that crown for an entire year until God of War released in 2005" [...] and [...] "a true video game classic, and maybe the best ninja game of all time."

500|$|Released to {{positive}} reviews, with aggregated scores of 87/100 on Metacritic and 88.7% on GameRankings, some journalists considered Super Monkey Ball {{the highlight of}} the GameCube's launch lineup. The staff of Edge praised the main game as [...] "absorb" [...] due to its high level of difficulty, noting that the trial and error required to complete challenging levels forces one to learn the nuances of its [...] "reductive control system" [...] and eventually enables the player to perform seemingly impossible tasks with increasing ease: [...] "Once a level falls, the mysticism around it vanishes. It's beatable; it's an afterthought on the route to your next impossible hurdle." [...] Writing for GameSpy, Ben Turner commented on the [...] "excellent progression of difficulty" [...] engendered by three distinct difficulty modes and thoughtful stage design, expounding [...] "most levels introduce some new idea or concept to the game" [...] and [...] "every single level played adds to your skill." [...] IGN's Matt Casamassina commended the [...] "great level variation", with [...] "well created mazes and puzzles that must be completed using a combination of physics calculations, careful planning and a huge helping of patience." [...] Turner complimented the frequent introduction of incentives to keep playing such as additional continues and hidden levels, adding that a high [...] "ceiling of mastery" [...] enhanced the game's longevity through a [...] "simple but well conceived" [...] scoring system and the ability to test strategies in practice mode. Edge and Casamassina thought similarly, with the latter stating [...] "there are shortcuts that can be carved out by the crafty player, physics to be considered when navigating and more." [...] N-Sider's Tim Knowles pointed out that [...] "the latter levels in the game get extremely difficult and you will often get frustrated", while Casamassina felt [...] "it may be a little too difficult for the casual gamer."
