The use of Extrinsic Conducting Polymer (ECP) material has been exploited {{in the production of}} densely packed sockets and connectors. The ECP consists of metallized particles embedded within a polymer compound, which are formed into a cylindrical column. A matrix of ECP columns are assembled onto a polyimide substrate that is commonly sandwiched between the <b>terminal</b> <b>pads</b> of printed circuit boards (PCB) to form an ECP-contact system.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the fabrication {{steps of a}} MEMS package based on silicon interposer wafers with copper filled TSVs and bonded cap wafers for hermetic sealing of resonator components. All processes were performed at 200 mm wafer level. For interposer fabrication a standard process flow including silicon blind hole etching, isolation, copper filling, wafer front side redistribution, support wafer bonding, wafer thinning, and TSV backside reveal was applied. As interposer backside metallization, appropriate I/O terminals and seal ring structures were deposited by semi-additive Au and Au+Sn electro plating. Following, getter material was deposited onto the interposer wafers which were 90 m thick and still mounted onto carrier wafers. Subsequently, the I/O <b>terminal</b> <b>pads</b> of the interposer were stud bumped and finally more than 5000 quartz resonator components were assembled onto each interposer wafer by Au-Au direct metal bonding. The cap wafer was equipped with 200 m deep dry etched cavities and electro plated Au seal rings around them. Finally, both cap and interposer wafers were bonded together using a wafer to wafer bonder and an adapted AuSn soldering process scheme. In a last step, the carrier wafer {{was removed from the}} former front side of the interposer wafer and wafer level testing was performed. From a total of 4824 tested devices we found that more than 75 % were sealed properly under vacuum.

40|$|The {{requirement}} of a wire to each electrode {{is central to}} the design of any electronic device but can also be a major restriction.

The finite space that is taken up by the array of electrical <b>terminals</b> and conductive <b>pads</b> also severely limits the achievable density of electrodes in the device. Here it is shown that a travelling light pointer can be used to form transient electrical connections anywhere on a monolithic semiconductor electrode that is fitted with a single peripheral electrical terminal.

It is shown that electrochemical information can be either read from or written onto these surfaces.

40|$|As the {{telecommunications}} industry evolves {{over the next decade}} to provide the products and services that people will desire, several key technologies will become commonplace. Two of these, automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis, will provide users with more freedom on when, where, and how they access information. While these technologies are currently in their infancy, their capabilities are rapidly increasing and their deployment in today's telephone network is expanding. The economic impact of just one application, the automation of operator services, is well over $ 100 million per year. Yet there still are many technical challenges that must be resolved before these technologies can be deployed ubiquitously in products and services throughout the worldwide telephone network. These challenges include: (i) High level of accuracy. The technology must be perceived by the user as highly accurate, robust, and reliable. (ii) Easy to use. Speech is only one of several possible input/output modalities for conveying information between a human and a machine, much like a computer <b>terminal</b> or Touch-Tone <b>pad</b> on a telephone. It is not the final product. Therefore, speech technologies must be hidden from the user. That is, the burden of using the technology must be on the technology itself. (iii) Quick prototyping and development of new products and services. The technology must support the creation of new products and services based on speech in an efficient and timely fashion. In this paper I present a vision of the voice-processing industry with a focus on the areas with the broadest base of user penetration: speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, natural language processing, and speaker recognition technologies. The current and future applications of these technologies in {{the telecommunications}} industry will be examined in terms of their strengths, limitations, {{and the degree to which}} user needs have been or have yet to be met.

40|$|Most {{electronics}} {{companies have}} transitioned to lead-free processes, both {{to comply with}} government legislation and to avoid issues related to mixing of tin-lead and lead-free metallurgies. However, exemptions from lead-free legislation have been granted for certain products, especially those intended for high-reliability applications. One major concern with these exempt products is that, during assembly or rework, lead-free components {{will have to be}} used due to the unavailability of tin-lead components. This will result in the mixing of tin-lead and lead-free metallurgies. The mixing of metallurgies can induce new reliability concerns. This study is focused on mixed solder joints formed by attaching lead-free components with tin-lead paste. Solder interconnect reliability is influenced by the environmental imposed load, solder material properties and the microstructure formed between the solder and the metal surfaces to which the solder is bonded. Several lead-free metallurgies are being used for component <b>terminals,</b> board <b>pad</b> plating and solder materials. These metallurgies react to form the microstructure of a solder joint. Microstructure of a solder joint continuously evolves and affects solder joint properties. A fundamental understanding on the microstructure is required to analyze the changes occurring in a solder joint with time and temperature and make predictions on solder joint reliability under thermal loading conditions. This dissertation determines key microstructural features present in SnPb, lead-free and mixed solder joints. Changes in the microstructural features were determined for SnPb, lead-free and mixed solder joints exposed to isothermal aging conditions. The effect of microstructural changes on reliability was determined by conducting thermal fatigue reliability tests for SnPb and lead-free solder joints. Whereas, for mixed solder joints, hypotheses has been determined based on microstructural analysis on their thermal fatigue performance compared to SnPb joints. This dissertation doesn't include the effect of microstructural changes on the reliability of mixed solder joints. This dissertation doesn't include the reliability tests for mixed solder joints. Two microstructural features namely, intermetallic compounds (IMC) and Pb phase were characterized for SnPb, lead-free and mixed solder joints. IMCs are formed at the solder to pad metallization interface and in the bulk solder. It was determined that reaction between Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder and Ni/Au component side metallization result in interfacial IMCs consisting of Ni 3 Sn 4 IMC in the as-reflowed stage and IMCs such as (NiCu) 3 Sn 4, (Cu,Ni) 6 Sn 5 and (Au,Ni) Sn 4 after thermal aging of 350 hours at 125 ºC. With pad metallization of ImAg, ImSn and OSP, IMCs such as Cu 6 Sn 5 are formed after reflow followed by formation of a new Cu 3 Sn IMC phase after thermal aging of 350 hours at 125 ºC. Cu 6 Sn 5 and Ag 3 Sn IMC were found distributed in bulk solder joints in the as-reflowed and aged (125 ºC for 100, 350 and 1000 hrs) solder joint. This dissertation demonstrated that under thermal cycling, intergranular crack propagates between Sn grains in the bulk solder and Cu 6 Sn 5 IMCs present at Sn grain boundaries in the bulk solder influence crack propagation. It was demonstrated that isothermal aging for 350 hrs at 125 ºC causes coarsening of Cu 6 Sn 5 IMC particles in the bulk solder which results in a 50 % reduction in number of Cu 6 Sn 5 IMC particles in the bulk solder, thus promoting the crack to propagate faster along the grain boundary. This dissertation determined that isothermal aging for 350 hrs at 125 ºC would cause a 25 % reduction in characteristic life for lead-free solder joints due to the changes associated with Cu 6 Sn 5 IMC particles. In conventional SnPb solder joints Pb phase present in the bulk solder coarsens as a function of time and temperature and influences thermal fatigue reliability. Due to the presence of Pb in mixed solder joint, this dissertation determined the extent of coarsening in mixed solder joints compared with SnPb joints. It was determined that mixed solder joints are not prone to Pb phase coarsening under aging for 350 hrs at 125 ºC as opposed to SnPb solder joints and therefore would have better thermal fatigue performance compared to SnPb joint under these conditions. This dissertation demonstrated that the presence of Pb in mixed solder results in a 30 to 40 % lower IMC thickness compared to Pb-free and SnPb solder joints by being present at the interface as a diffusion barrier between Ni and Sn for IMC formation. Presence of Pb has been known to act as diffusion barrier for SnPb solder joints...|$|R
30|$|One of {{the common}} methods of {{chemical}} stabilization is to mix soil with cement to form a product named as soil–cement [19]. Soil–cement {{can be defined as}} a mixture of soil and measured amounts of Portland cement and water and compacted to the desired density. Soil–cement {{has been used as a}} base material as an adoption of improved measure in many projects, such as slope protection of dams and embankments, pavement of highways, building <b>pads,</b> <b>terminals</b> for rail and truck, composting facilities, cheap base for streets, parking lots, channels and reservoir linings, mass soil–cement placement for dikes, foundation stabilization etc. The soil–cement technique has been practiced almost for 100  years. It serves to amend the mechanical and the engineering properties of the soil. The new performance depends on the ability of the additives to react with the mixing soil. There are four main properties of soil; strength, permeability, volume stability, and durability that can be enhanced with additives [20, 21]. The choice of a specific additive depends on the type of soil, service that is required to serve and the surrounding environment. When water is mixed with cement, hydration occurs, meaning cementing compounds of calcium–silicate–hydrate (C–S–H) and calcium–aluminate–hydrate (C–A–H) are formed and excess calcium hydroxide (CaOH) is released, approximately 31 % by weight [22]. Formation of C–S–H and C–A–H occurs when crystals begin forming a few hours after the water and cement are mixed; crystals will continue to form as long as unreacted cement particles and free water remain within the mixture [15]. Five standard types of Portland cement (Types I through V) are available as specified by ASTM C 150. The process of cementation and the results of soil–cement and lime stabilization are similar, they used in quantities too small to provide high-strength cementing action. They reduce the plasticity of clay soils. Calcium chloride or sodium chloride are added to the soil to retain moisture and also control dust, to hold fine material for better compaction, and to reduce frost heave by lowering the freezing point of water in the soil. Kezdi [23] reports that cement treatment slightly increases the maximum dry density of sand and highly plastic clays but it decreases the maximum dry density of silt [24]. In contrast studies by Deng and Tabatabai [24] shows that cement increases the optimum water content but decreases the maximum dry density of sandy soils [25]. Cement increases plastic limit and reduces liquid limit, which mainly reduces plasticity index [24]. The other significant effects of soil–cement stabilization is reduction in shrinkage and swell potential, increase in strength, elastic modulus, and resistance against the effect of moisture, freeze, and thaw. Cement treated soils show a brittle behavior compare of non-treated soils [26, 27]. Cement can be applied to stabilize any type of soil, except soils with organic content greater than 2 % or having pH lower than 5.3 (ACI 230.1 R- 90, 1990). The use of cement in granular soils has proven to be economical and effective because smaller amounts of cement are required. In addition, soils that have a PI value higher than 30 are difficult to mix with cement. To avoid this issue, lime can be added prior to mixing in cement; this initial step will keep soils more workable [28, 29, 30, 31].|$|R
