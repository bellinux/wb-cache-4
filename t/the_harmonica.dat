However, for her début album, The Kick Inside (1978), she was persuaded to use established session musicians, some of whom she would retain even after she had brought her bandmates back on board. Her brother Paddy played <b>the</b> <b>harmonica</b> and mandolin, unlike on later albums where he would play more exotic instruments such as the balalaika and didgeridoo. Stuart Elliott played some of the drums and would become her main drummer on subsequent albums.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene where}} Danny Lee chases a gunman onto a tram was filmed in Causeway Bay {{and the crew}} only had three hours to film. Residents {{thought it was a}} real gunfight and phoned the police. However, when the police arrived, Danny Lee talked to the {{superintendent}} so they could continue filming. Scenes from the Dragon Boat festival were shot months apart, some footage was of the boat races and rest of the footage involving the actors was shot months later. It was planned for the boats to flip over during the chase but the owners refused because they felt it would bring bad luck. The scene at the airport were filmed at the Kai Tak Airport. The scenes at Paul Chu Kong's character's house were filmed in Stanley, Hong Kong. John Woo wanted this house to be by a beach but a suitable location could not be found. The action scene inside the house took 28 days to shoot. The final action scene took 36 days to shoot and was shot at a remote building made to look like a church while the exterior seen from Ah Jong's apartment is a real church. The original ending of the film involved Jennie waiting at an airport for Li to give her the money and for them to travel to the United States. Due to Sally Yeh's tight filming schedule, the scene was not filmed and replaced with Ah Jong playing <b>the</b> <b>harmonica.</b>|$|E

25|$|Popper is a {{founding}} member of Blues Traveler, serving as the band's front man with lead vocals and harmonica. For some songs, he forgoes <b>the</b> <b>harmonica</b> in favor of guitar, most often a 12-string acoustic. In addition, Popper has played the tin whistle on some recordings.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> World <b>Harmonica</b> Festival {{is held in}} {{the autumn}} every four years in Trossingen, Germany, home of <b>the</b> Hohner <b>{{harmonica}}</b> company. <b>The</b> last World <b>Harmonica</b> Festival was in 2009, and a harmonica workshop is held every year. <b>The</b> Asia Pacific <b>Harmonica</b> Festival is held regularly; in 2008 it was hosted by China.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>harmonica's</b> {{versatility}} {{brought it}} to the attention of classical music during the 1930s. American Larry Adler was one of <b>the</b> first <b>harmonica</b> players to perform major works written for the instrument by the composers Ralph Vaughan Williams, Malcolm Arnold, Darius Milhaud and Arthur Benjamin.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, {{harmonica}} production {{was a big}} business, having evolved into mass production. New designs were still developed in the 20th century, including <b>the</b> chromatic <b>harmonica,</b> first made by Hohner in 1924, <b>the</b> bass <b>harmonica,</b> and <b>the</b> chord <b>harmonica.</b> In <b>the</b> 21st century, radical new designs have been developed and are still being introduced into the market, such as the Suzuki Overdrive, Hohner XB-40, and the ill-fated Harrison B-Radical.|$|R
25|$|Hackett grew {{up having}} access to various musical instruments, such as <b>the</b> <b>harmonica</b> (which he would later play on some of his albums) and recorder, but did not develop an {{interest}} in the guitar until the age of 12, when he started playing single notes. By 14, he was learning chords and experimenting with chord progressions, although he never received any formal instruction.|$|E
25|$|Juke {{became the}} most {{important}} and influential song for blues harmonica players of the era, and was expected to be in the repertoire of any serious blues harmonica player; at least in Chicago, blues harmonica players were judged on their ability to play it. In addition, Juke popularized the Chicago blues harmonica technique still in use today by harmonica players around the world: using a small hand-held microphone cupped to <b>the</b> <b>harmonica</b> to produce a dynamic, rich and slightly distorted amplified harmonica sound.|$|E
25|$|Acuff {{was born}} on September 15, 1903 in Maynardville, Tennessee to Ida (née Carr) and Simon E. Neill Acuff, the third of their five children. The Acuffs were a fairly {{prominent}} family in Union County. Roy's paternal grandfather, Coram Acuff, had been a Tennessee state senator, and Roy's maternal grandfather was a local physician. Roy's father was an accomplished fiddler and a Baptist preacher, his mother was proficient on the piano, and during Roy's early years the Acuff house was a popular place for local gatherings. At such gatherings, Roy would often amuse people by balancing farm tools on his chin. He also learned to play <b>the</b> <b>harmonica</b> and jaw harp at a young age.|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} with David Letterman, Lewis talked about hitchhiking across the country back to New York City and how he learned to play <b>the</b> <b>harmonica</b> while waiting for rides. He talked about {{hanging out at the}} airport for three days until he stowed away on a plane to Europe. In later interviews, Lewis would reveal other encounters he had traveling around Europe. While visiting Aberdeen, Scotland, with no money and nowhere to sleep, he claimed that the locals were very hospitable by offering him somewhere to stay. In Madrid, Spain, he became an accomplished blues player as he hitchhiked and supported himself by busking with his harmonica. He gave his first concerts in Madrid, earning enough money to buy a plane ticket back to the USA.|$|E
25|$|Popper has {{developed}} some equipment innovations to accommodate {{his use of}} harmonicas during onstage performances. Because each individual diatonic harmonica is tuned to one particular key, he fashioned belts with enough pockets to hold harmonicas in all 12 keys (plus extras) and wore them as a bandolier, or slung over his neck. He frequently has to switch keys multiple times within one song, and this arrangement allowed him to quickly trade one harmonica for another without looking. In 2002, he stopped using the belts because they no longer fit him properly due to his weight loss; now he carries his harmonicas in a small black attaché case. He uses a special microphone with switches that change the audio effect of <b>the</b> <b>harmonica</b> as it is played through an amplifier, similar to a guitar effects pedal. Popper was inspired by Jimi Hendrix's guitar playing to make his instrument sound however he wanted.|$|E
25|$|On its 10th anniversary, {{the show}} was {{broadcast}} from the new BBC MediaCityUK in Salford featuring film music played by the BBC Philharmonic. As part {{of the performance of}} the score from Midnight Cowboy, Kermode played <b>the</b> <b>harmonica</b> solo with the orchestra after volunteering at the roundtable discussion, not realising the part required the chromatic harmonica rather than the diatonic harmonica, the instrument he plays. After the broadcast on Radio 5 finished, there was more discussion and music on sister station BBC Radio 3 later that evening. The music for the broadcast was chosen by guests for a special roundtable discussion, released as a bonus podcast, except for one decision (between the music for Jaws and Indiana Jones) which was opened to the public for a text vote with the winner (Indiana Jones) being announced on Friday 27 May. The guests for the roundtable discussion were Andrew Collins, Paloma Faith, Richard Wigley and Robert Ziegler.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Magnus <b>Harmonica</b> Corporation (originally <b>the</b> International Plastic <b>Harmonica</b> Corporation) {{was founded}} in 1944 in New Jersey by Danish {{immigrant}} Finn Magnus (1905-1976). First supplying American troops in World War II, and later marketed to children and other beginners, <b>the</b> company's <b>harmonicas</b> (as well as its accordions, bagpipes, and mechanical reed organs) used a then-unique molded-plastic reed comb. The styrene-based plastic construction resulted in lower cost, greater durability, and a distinct sound compared to other free reed aerophones with metal reeds.|$|R

500|$|The film's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Lowell Lo and edited by David Wu. A reoccurring musical theme is a haunting vibraphone theme which is first {{heard over the}} opening credits. <b>The</b> <b>harmonica</b> motif in the film {{was influenced by the}} soundtracks of Ennio Morricone, specifically the soundtrack to Once Upon a Time in America, and used a bottle blower to give the music a haunting effect. David Wu said the influence of <b>the</b> <b>Harmonica</b> music in Sergio Leone's western films was a strong influence on his work. During the final action scene when the statue of the Virgin Mary is destroyed, the action music transitions to [...] "Overture" [...] from Messiah by George Frideric Handel. This was the idea of editor David Wu who felt that it would break up the numbing effect of the kinetic violence.|$|E
