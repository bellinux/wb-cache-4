25|$|Morgan {{made one}} movie {{in which he}} had the lead role, {{producer}} Stanley Kramer's sophisticated comedy So <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>New</b> York (1948), which also featured Arnold Stang and was loosely based upon Ring Lardner's 1920 novel The Big Town. Though Morgan and the film received favorable critical reviews, it didn't go over as well with the public as his radio and later television work did.|$|E

500|$|One of its {{ground floor}} tenants has won several awards. [...] Acadiana is a 185-seat upscale {{restaurant}} which serves Louisiana-and Cajun-style seafood. Esquire magazine called {{it one of}} the best new restaurants in the entire United States in 2006. Frommer's said of the restaurant, [...] "The restaurant's high ceilings, ornate chandeliers, and oversize urns fit with the prevailing, over-the-top atmosphere. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>New</b> Orleans right here. New Orleanians say the cuisine's the real thing, starting with the biscuits, served with a pepper jelly and cream cheese condiment, continuing on to deviled eggs, charbroiled oysters, and crabmeat and artichoke gratin starters; and even further to jambalaya, étouffée, red snapper in an almondine sauce and barbecue shrimp. Service is excellent".|$|E
500|$|The Catlins {{features}} dense temperate rainforest, {{dominated by}} podocarps. This {{is the largest}} area of native forest remaining on the South Island's east coast, with over [...] of forest and neighbouring subalpine areas being protected in Catlins Conservation Park. The forest is thick with trees such as rimu, totara, silver beech, matai and kahikatea. Of particular note are the virgin rimu and totara forest remaining in those areas which were too rugged or steep to have been milled by early settlers, and an extensive area of silver beech forest close to the Takahopa River. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>New</b> Zealand's most southerly expanse of beech forest. Many native species of forest plant {{can be found in}} the undergrowth of the Catlins forest, including young lancewoods, orchids such as the spider orchid and perching Easter orchid, and many different native ferns.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first movie}} {{produced}} under his production company was the comedy, So <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>New</b> York (1948), directed by Richard Fleischer, {{and based on}} Ring Lardner's The Big Town. It failed at the box office. It was followed [...] with Champion (1949), another Lardner story, this one about an ambitious and unscrupulous boxer. Scripted by Foreman, it was tailored to fit the talents of Kirk Douglas, an ex-wrestler who had recently become an actor. Filmed in only twenty-three days with a relatively small budget, it became an immense box-office success. It won an Academy Award for Best Editing, with four other nominations, including Douglas for best actor and Foreman as screenwriter.|$|E

60|$|I duck {{under the}} train and make for the rods, and I can tell you I am mighty glad that the train is {{standing}} still.

Down in the United States I am accustomed to going underneath on rapidly moving trains, seizing a gunnel and swinging my feet under to the brake-beam, and from there crawling over the top of the truck and down inside the truck to a seat on the cross-rod.|$|E

Ralph, I do will it with all my heart and soul and body, and I suppose that I have willed it ever since I was a woman, though until this hour I did not quite know what it was I willed. Nay, dear, do not touch me, or at the least, not yet. First hear what I have to say, and then if you desire it, you may kiss me--if only in farewell." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir Thomas More.--Call to mind, I pray you, my foliophagous friend, {{what was}} the extent of Michael Montaigne's library; and {{that if you had}} passed a winter in his chateau you must, with that {{appetite}} of yours, have but yourself upon short allowance there. Historical knowledge is not the first thing needful for a statesman, nor the second. And yet do not hastily conclude that I am about to disparage its importance. A sailor might as well put to sea without chart or compass as a minister venture to steer the ship of the State without it. For as [...] "the strong and strange varieties" [...] in human nature are repeated in every age, so [...] "the thing which hath been, it is that which shall be.

It will be terrible for her when the news comes that her father and brothers are all killed, and that you are lying here sorely wounded. It will be well nigh enough to drive her distraught. But if she were to come over here at once she would, while busying about you, have less time to brood over her griefs; and, indeed, I see not why she should be told what has happened at Vordwyk until she is here with you, and you can break it to her. It will come better from your lips, and for your sake she will restrain her grief." ...|$|E
