In the present study, the sensitivities to pressure and temperature were examined experimentally using an electronically- gated, intensified Charged- Coupled-Device (CCD) video camera, frame-grabber software and an eight-inch diameter calibration chamber. Using a signal generator, in a procedure that matched the requirements of the rotor application, multiple low-intensity-level camera exposures were integrated and captured to produce a single usable image. Ten captured images were averaged to increase the image's signal-to-noise ratio and the result was used to produce an image ratio with respect to a static (ambient pressure/temperature) reference condition. Calibration tests of constant temperature/variable pressure and constant pressure/variable temperature were completed. The results were then compared with data obtained using the same paint and an automated, single- exposure calibration procedure at NASA Ames Research Center.

40|$|Understanding {{the dynamic}} {{characteristics}} of blades {{is important in}} the online condition monitoring of turbomachinery. Conventionally contact methods are used for this purpose. However improvements in technology now allow for the use of non-contact methods. Contact measurement techniques for turbomachinery blade vibration analysis typically involve the use of strain gauges and accelerometers. These present some complications when analyzing rotating machinery. Being contact in nature, mass loading can affect the integrity of measurements captured. Turbomachines typically operate under the adverse conditions of high temperatures, high flow rates and sometimes wet environments. This significantly reduces the life of contact transducers installed to capture the blade dynamics. Installation of telemetry systems for signal transmission is also necessary. In addition to being invasive and expensive, telemetry systems can introduce electrical noise. These factors make it desirable to explore the applicability of various optical non-contact methods for analyzing turbomachine blade vibrations, such as Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) and photogrammetry. Both techniques have been successfully used to analyze vibrations of structures. Photogrammetry is a full-field measurement technique which allows for non-intrusive simultaneous measurement of vibrations at different locations on a blade. This is particularly important for the updating of numerically developed models of structures, investigation of structural global dynamics, and more effective localization of damage. Accelerometers have been used to validate a variation of photogrammetry, three dimensional point tracking (3 DPT), for rotational applications and discrepancies attributed to the contact nature of accelerometers were observed. To build confidence in the use of 3 DPT as a non-contact method for analyzing rotating machines, it is necessary to investigate how well it correlates with various non-contact methods. Through such an investigation aspects {{that need to be addressed}} when using 3 DPT to analyse turbomachines can be identified. If reliable measurements can be obtained using this technique, further investigations such as online damage detection and characterization in rotating structures can be conducted. In this study Tracking Laser Doppler Vibrometry (TLDV) and 3 DPT are used as non-contact methods to investigate the online vibrations of a turbomachine <b>test</b> <b>rotor.</b> To employ TLDV on the <b>test</b> <b>rotor,</b> the dynamics of the scanning mirrors of a Polytec Scanning Vibrometer (PSV) are characterized using a frequency response approach. Look-up tables are constructed to provide the necessary phase angle compensation for the two signals supplied to the mirrors, to obtain a circular scanning path. Photogrammetric 3 DPT is then validated by tracking the TLDV laser spot focused on one of the <b>test</b> <b>rotor</b> blade using high speed cameras, and comparing the 3 DPT measurements to TLDV blade out-of-plane vibration measurements. The correlation between the two non-contact measurement techniques is presented. This establishes the validity of the employed scanning system, and also serves to show how well the two non-contact methods correlate with each other, when investigating dynamics of turbomachinery blades. 3 DPT is then used to analyze the responses of the <b>test</b> <b>rotor</b> blades under excitation. Various Operational Deflection Shapes (ODSs) of the blades are identified and the results obtained are presented. The use of ODSs obtained from 3 DPT to investigate irregularities along turbomachinery blades is also presented.

40|$|Gas foil {{bearings}} (GFB) {{appear to}} satisfy most requirements for oil-free turbomachinery, i. e. relatively simple in construction, ensuring low drag friction and reliable high speed operation. However, GFBs {{have a limited}} load capacity and minimal amounts of damping. A test rig for the rotordynamic evaluation of gas foil bearings was constructed. A DC router motor, 25 krpm max speed, drives a 1. 02 kg hollow rotor supported on two bump-type foil gas bearings (L = D = 38. 10 mm). Measurements of the <b>test</b> <b>rotor</b> dynamic response were conducted for increasing mass imbalance conditions. Typical waterfalls of rotor coast down response from 25 krpm to rest evidence the onset and disappearance of severe subsynchronous motions with whirl frequencies at ~ 50 % of rotor speed, roughly coinciding with the (rigid mode) natural frequencies of the rotor-bearing system. The amplitudes of motion, synchronous and subsynchronous, increase (non) linearly {{with respect to the}} imbalance displacements. The rotor motions are rather large; yet, the foil bearings, by virtue of their inherent flexibility, prevented the catastrophic failure of the <b>test</b> <b>rotor.</b> Tests at the top shaft speed, 25 krpm, did not excite subsynchronous motions. In the experiments, the subsynchronous motion speed range is well confined to shaft speeds ranging from 22 krpm to 12 krpm. The experimental results show the severity of subsynchronous motions is related to the amount of imbalance in the rotor. Surprisingly enough, external air pressurization {{on one side of the}} foil bearings acted to reduce the amplitudes of motion while the rotor crossed its critical speeds. An air-film hovering effect may have enhanced the sliding of the bumps thus increasing the bearings?? damping action. The tests also demonstrate that increasing the gas feed pressure ameliorates the amplitudes of subsynchronous motions due to the axial flow retarding the circumferential flow velocity development. A finite element rotordynamic analysis models the <b>test</b> <b>rotor</b> and uses predicted bearing force coefficients from the static equilibrium GFB load analysis. The rotordynamic analysis predicts critical speeds at ~ 8 krpm and ~ 9 krpm, which correlate well with test critical speeds. Predictions of rotordynamic stability are calculated for the test speed range (0 to 25 krpm), showing unstable operation for the rotor/bearing system starting at 12 krpm and higher. Predictions and experimental results show good agreement in terms of critical speed correlation, and moderate displacement amplitude discrepancies for some imbalance conditions. Post-test inspection of the rotor evidenced sustained wear at the locations in contact with the bearings' axial edges. However, the foil bearings are almost in pristine condition; except for top foil coating wear at the bearing edges and along the direction of applied static load...|$|E

Further modifications include manufacturing two rotors, repairing the main housing, aligning the motor shaft and <b>test</b> <b>rotor,</b> upgrading the water pipeline system, developing a static load system, installing instrumentation, and developing means of data acquisition. Presently, the revamped system has rotated to a speed of 5 krpm. Measurements of the free-free mode natural frequencies and lateral mode shapes of the rotor-coupling system show that the rotor and quill shaft operate as a unit. Once assembled, water lubricates the bearings to lift and support the <b>test</b> <b>rotor</b> connected to the motor through its coupling. Impact loads identify the system fundamental natural frequency and damping ratio for operation without rotor speed or active thrust bearings. The flexibility of the quill shaft commands {{the location of the}} system lateral natural frequency (~ 93 Hz) and its low damping ratio. XLTRC 2 ? based predictions agree well with the measured natural frequency and identified damping ratio. The water lubricates the radial bearings to lift the <b>test</b> <b>rotor</b> again as the motor accelerates the rotor to 5 krpm. During this operation, the rotor motion is synchronous and does not excite the first natural frequency. While operating at speeds up to 5 krpm, the system did not reach its first critical speed. Measurements show the thrust bearing axial clearance increases as the water supply pressure increases, max. 4. 14 bar(g), for operation with a constant axial load and at null or low rotor speed (3 krpm). As the imposed axial load increases, the operating clearance decreases exponentially. The decreasing operating clearance causes an increased flow resistance across the film lands, resulting in a reduced flow rate. As the flow rate decreases, there is a lower pressure drop across each orifice, resulting in an increase in recess pressure. The derived axial stiffness increases as the axial clearance decreases or the water supply pressure increases. XLHydroThrust? uses the thrust bearing geometry to generate predictions of thrust bearing performance. The predictions accurately describe the influence of the load and supply pressure on the thrust bearing performance; however, there are discrepancies between the magnitudes of the predictions and the magnitudes of the measurements at a high axial load (low axial clearance). The average percent difference between the predicted and measured magnitudes of supply flow rate, flow rate through inner diameter, axial clearance, and recess pressure ratio change from 2 % to 47 %, 7 % to 73 %, 25 % to 53 %, and 7 % to 18 %, respectively, as the applied axial load increases from its minimum to maximum magnitude. Thus, there is a significant increase in difference between the predicted and measured magnitudes as the applied axial load increases.
