6000|$|... ‘But for Mr. Honeythunder’s eloquence, I {{might have}} {{had no need to}} ask you what I am going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> <b>This</b> Mr. Edwin Drood, sir: I think that’s the name?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To see you," [...] she answered. [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> Arnold. You wish Monsieur Feurgéres to go free. You wish to stay my hand. What price are {{you willing}} to pay?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MR. RICHARDS: [...] "I wish <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> just <b>this,</b> Miss Galbraith: if you couldn't ride {{backwards}} in {{the other}} car, why do you ride backwards in this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your wishing so won't put me there, my lord. If {{it would}} I {{should not be}} weak enough <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for <b>this</b> money. Do <b>you</b> mean to comply with my request?" ...|$|R
60|$|GILBEY. I didnt mean <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do <b>this,</b> Mr Juggins. I wasnt {{thinking}} when I rang.|$|R
6000|$|... "But don't {{you think}} it would be nice," [...] said the lady, [...] "if you were to come to lunch with us to-morrow? It was <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> that I inquired for you at the toll-gate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{begin to}} have hopes," [...] he {{acknowledged}} frankly, [...] "that I have been drawn into another mare's nest. Nevertheless, I am bound <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> question, Miss Abbeway. Did you leave your room at all during last night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Katie {{still held}} her mother's hand in hers, and lay {{back against the}} pillows which had been placed behind her back. 'And now, mamma,' she said at last, 'I am going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> favour--I want to see Charley once more.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems so}} natural, mamma, <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for <b>this</b> and that. I shall want nobody but {{you to be}} near me, or to do {{anything}} for me. But do not let me be troublesome. Check me if I encroach." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are {{all to the}} good," [...] said Smith. [...] "Now, {{the thing}} I wished <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> is <b>this.</b> The office of the paper was, until this morning, {{securely}} guarded by Comrade Brady, whose name will be familiar to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Francesco (advancing). I abhor a listener; [...] 280 [...] But {{you spoke}} so, I could not choose but hear you.

6000|$|Captain Westover nodded. [...] "I suppose so. I want to {{beg your}} pardon first for what I am going to say, De Vaux. If I make an ass of myself, don't scruple to say so! But I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this!</b> Why, in thunder, did you let Adrea what's-her-name, the dancing girl, come down here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt; and {{for that}} very reason I am not afraid <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> You used {{occasionally}} to come to church, so that it can't be scruples of conscience that keep you away. As a rule, in London we always have a very fair sprinkling of agnostics in a congregation, and sometimes more than a sprinkling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can tackle it all right," [...] his {{companion}} assured him encouragingly. [...] "For {{a week or}} ten days you've nothing more to do than a little ordinary detective business. If I decide {{to carry out a}} scheme which is forming in my mind, it will be a more serious affair. Time enough for that, though. I should just like <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> Can you find a few bullies of the Tom Grogan class, if necessary?" ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{went into}} the dining-room to discuss their business. When the barrack matter had been {{arranged}} De Stancy said, 'I have a little commission to execute for my friend Mr. Somerset. I am <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> if <b>this</b> portrait of the person he suspects of unlawfully entering his room is like the man you saw there?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I'm betraying a {{confidence}} in admitting it. Anyway, I felt that one ought {{to help him}} for the family's sake, lest he get into worse trouble; and I could afford the loan. Since I married I've been making some money. But I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> about <b>this</b> Harding. What kind of fellow is he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'It {{were well}} for you, valiant senor, were I {{at liberty to}} do so; but on {{questioning}} those of your sailors whom I have already taken, I cannot hear that you have any letters of license, either from the queen of England, or any other potentate. I am compelled, therefore, <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> whether <b>this</b> is so; for {{it is a matter}} of life and death.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If that {{is really}} your opinion of us, Prince," [...] he said, [...] "it is useless to enter into {{argument}} with you, especially as you have already acted upon your convictions. I should like <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> question, though. A few weeks ago an appeal was made to our young men to bring up to its full strength certain forces which have been organized for the defence of the country. Do {{you know how many}} recruits we obtained in less than a month?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Maraton," [...] he said, [...] "now I {{am going}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> question. To-morrow {{you go to}} Manchester to {{pronounce}} your doctrines. To-morrow {{you are going to}} incite the working people of England practically to revolt. Are you going to tell them that it is for posterity they must strike? Do you mean, when you thunder at them from the platforms, to tell them the truth?--to tell them that the good which you promise is not for them nor for their children, nor their children's children, but for the unborn generations? Do you mean to tell them this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{agree with}} you," [...] Laverick answered, [...] "but, {{on the other}} hand, you must {{remember}} that these gentlemen have had no choice. I stepped from my office direct into the taxi, and I proposed to drive straight from here {{to the place where}} I shall probably leave the other document I am carrying with me. Why I have taken you into my confidence is <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> Can you walk with me to the corner of the street, or until we meet a taxicab? it sounds cowardly, but, as a matter of fact, I am not afraid. I simply want to make sure of delivering this document to the person to whom it belongs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That has {{all been}} noted. What I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> is <b>this.</b> Our contact with you {{has been through}} vidscreen only. We must rely on {{indirect}} evidence, since none of us goes above. We can only infer what is going on. We never see anything ourselves. We {{have to take it}} all secondhand. Some top leaders are beginning to think there's too much room for error." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} quite ready," [...] I answered. [...] "There {{are only one}} or two things I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> One is <b>this,</b> what {{explanation}} is to be given of my occupying that room, if there is a row?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Jimmy, [...] "I {{have nothing}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for <b>this</b> time. Instead, I am {{simply going to}} mention certain facts, and leave you {{to act on the}} {{information}} in the only way open to you; that is, to get out of Vancouver as soon as possible. I am giving you the opportunity in order to save Miss Merril the pain of seeing you prosecuted. You are in our hands now." ...|$|R
5000|$|Interviewer: I have <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> because it's been {{killing me}} {{for the past five}} years. On the song A Sorta Fairytale ... you sing about pulling back the hood. Are you talking about the hood I think you're talking about? ...|$|E
40|$|What I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> {{afternoon}} {{is whether}} the ragwort and the poppies of our battlefields are simply a kind of decorative relief to the squalor and heroism of human doings, whether nature is just a backdrop to how we comprehend God as dealing {{with us in our}} religious experience. What is the relationship between the waste of the natural world and those losses felt by ourselves? Do they count? Or do they find you – and God – dispassionate...|$|E

D. ’s playing “Stardust”—Gee, {{it sounds}} so nice. Now it’s “Oh, Look At Me Now. ” That will always be one of my {{favorite}} songs. My ankle is almost back to normal but my foot is still swollen. I was hoping that I could go to work tomorrow but if my foot doesn’t go down a little, it wouldn’t be wise. My whole right side of my ankle is all black 2 ̆ 6 blue. It looks as though someone had given me a real beating. Darling, I miss you so much. Why can’t we be together all the time. It seems so mean to be so near 2 ̆ 6 yet so far. Woody’s coming over tonight. She hadn’t been able to get over because of all the homework she had. Golly, I wish Saturday would hurry 2 ̆ 6 get here. Don’t worry, honey, I won’t say anything about the Air Raid Drill. As far as I’m concerned it’s forgotten. What I can see of today doesn’t look too nice. It’s pretty foggy 2 ̆ 6 dampish looking—I wish it would get nice so that you’d be able to get more hours in and get more time off for Christmas. Honey, I’ve been meaning <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> for a long time so before I forget, on the 28 th do {{you have to go back}} to Stewart Field or will you be able to go to Advanced from home? When will you have to be back at Stewart from Christmas? It will be swell, hon, if you get off the 23 rd. That’s on Saturday and we don’t work Saturdays. So we’ll have Saturday, Sunday, Monday 2 ̆ 6 then if you have the 26 th and 27 th off maybe I can take them off too. It would be even better if they let you off Friday (the 22 nd) because we’ll be having a Christmas party at work 2 ̆ 6 I’ll be able to leave real early. Gee, honey, it’s only a few weeks more til Christmas 2 ̆ 6 I haven’t done any of my Christmas shopping. Besides that I won’t have very much time when I do get back to work. How is Tom? I haven’t heard you speak about him for quite a while. Did he finally propose or did her kid brother stick around? There was an article about Lonnie in the Pelham Sun 2 ̆ 6 I’ve been thinking about it all morning. I just can’t believe that Lon’s dead or that the Japs could be so cruel. I can’t believe that people can be that mean 2 ̆ 6 heartless. Lonnie was such a swell fellow. I’ll bet his family are broken hearted about it. They got the telegram on Thanksgiving. That certainly must have made their Thanksgiving miserable. Those telegrams are so blunt, too. When I first heard about his death (right after you’d given me the ring) it didn’t actually sink in but I sure feel awful now. I keep seeing him parachuting down 2 ̆ 6 the Japs shooting at him—It’s awful. I can’t get it out of my mind. Did you know Frank McManus? He got his wings and he’s first pilot on a B- 24. Honey, I wish this war would end. So many people are being hurt by it. I don’t see how people can be so stupid to shoot each other and kill others. Well, I’d better get my mind off that for a while. Golly, I hate to stay in bed when I’m supposed to. Whenever I’m in bed I want to be out of it 2 ̆ 6 when I’m out I’d love to be getting some rest. People are crazy. I was just reading some magazines 2 ̆ 6 you know the usual stories. They’re married 2 ̆ 6 hubby starts straying 2 ̆ 6 finds another woman. He finally comes back to wifey but only after she’s pulled out all her hair trying to be patient. I wonder if you’ll find “another woman—That’s something I’m not looking forward to finding out. Honey, I miss you so. It’s Wednesday 2 ̆ 6 only two more days ‘til I see you. Hope my ankle will be better by tomorrow. I want to go to work. Hello again honey, it’s night now. I’ve been writing this in stages sorta. I wish this darned cold would go away. I’m really in great shape at this point. Gee, I love you so. I wish you could be here now. Tomorrow night you’re going to call. Gee, honey, it will be wonderful to hear your voice again. Tomorrow’s Thursday and then only one day til we go to see you (That sounds like visiting day at jail). Honey, what a week this has been. I hate just lying in bed. It’s so dull. This week did go fairly fast for me though. Probably tomorrow and Friday will drag terribly. Gee, honey, I love you so. You’re everything I love. There are so many little things I love about you darling—Your laugh 2 ̆ 6 smile, the way you worry and try to be practical. Oh, Mary Jane Kessler just called. She was a riot. She was so surprised 2 ̆ 6 wished us the best of luck 2 ̆ 6 all that stuff. She said to congratulate you 2 ̆ 6 that we should come over 2 ̆ 6 see her soon. Juliet has a six-weeks old baby. I said maybe we could next Sunday. She just wants to say hello. Walt was home last Sunday for six hours. He’s gone over now, though. He’s in the infantry and is a replacement. He’d been in the Army about five months. We covered everything in that conversation, I guess 2 ̆ 6 Mary thinks we make a cute couple—(naturally!). She said she almost died when she saw my picture in the paper. Golly, I didn’t think it was that bad. Have you heard from Don yet? I wonder what he’ll say. Did you write Dudley yet, hon? Charlotte’s here—or is it Woody. It’s Woody. Woody just left. She had gotten a letter from Steve. Honey, you can tell Steve what time we’re coming up 2 ̆ 6 everything because you’ll know before I will. He can find out about the passes from you. Darling before I forget—Please, honey, have your picture taken and give it to me, please! I don’t have one big picture of you so please as soon as you can. Have one smiling 2 ̆ 6 one serious. There was something else I wanted to remember to ask you, hon, but per usual I’ve forgotten. I’ll hang my head with shame. Honey, I don’t think that I’ll be able to go to work at all this week. I’m afraid to walk on it before Saturday. I’ll have it bandaged up Saturday morning before we come to the air show. Honey, what (not to be a wet blanket) will happen if it rains? Has Steve said anything more about getting home? I hope he can because I’ll bet his family will love seeing him on Christmas. Well, honey, I love you very much. You’re so wonderful. Please write soon darling. Gee, I miss you so. It will be wonderful to hear your voice again darling. I wish every night were Saturday—especially last Friday or Saturday. No, I guess that wouldn’t be so smart. I love you so, honey. After tomorrow there’ll only be one more day til Saturday. Honey, I’m still going to get very tight at our wedding reception. After all, once in a lifetime isn’t too much, honey. Well, darling, I’ll write again tomorrow. Take care of yourself, sweet, and I love you so. Honey, there just aren’t enough words in the English language to tell you how very much in love with you I am. There goes my English again. Mr. Lacey would be horrified if he could hear that. Honey, are you good in Math? There were a couple of questions I asked you that you haven’t answered. One I remember was do you like big dogs? This is as bad as saying goodnight to you—I could write on all night just saying I love you. (Frances Langford is singing “Making Believe”—) That reminds me of you. They played “And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine” a lot today. I just hate to stop writing to you. I love you so. It seems that I’ve said that before (once or twice). How do you feel about last weekend? It was so different. I always fall in love with you all over again each weekend. How much can you love a person? I never would have believed that I could love anyone the way I love you. I’m so glad that it is you, too. There isn’t a better man in the world. The love I have for you is the kind I’ve always hoped for but had just about decided didn’t exist. Now I know it does. Darling, I hope we will always be crazy and wacky and so much in love. I’m so unsociable when we’re together. Honestly, hon, it’s getting worse 2 ̆ 6 worse. I’m glad we only have silver enough for four—Then we can’t have much company. I can just imagine how eagerly we’ll await company. That should be never. Well, my darling, it’s awfully late. I love you. Honey, I wish I could tell you how much—I love you. All my love,Dottie P. S. I love you, honey. Will write more tomorrow—I love you. P. P. S. S. Good night my darling. I love you! P. P. P. S. S. S. Your Mom 2 ̆ 6 Bobby just called—They’re wonderful too—I like them loads. They’re so much fun. They were very unhappy about the picture, too. Oh, well—that’s life. Aren’t I philophosic (made a mess of that word). Honey, I miss you awfully. It’s so hard to know you’re so near 2 ̆ 6 that we can’t be together til a weekend. That’s better than when you leave Stewart but it’s not much consolation. Mr. Kennett, the owner of the Pelham Sun, is real mad at me because the Argust [sic] 2 ̆ 6 Standard announced my engagement before he did. Daddy’s threatening him unless the picture’s better in that paper than in the Star. Well, my darling, I love you—I’ll write another real long letter tomorrow. What would you like me to write about, honey, anything special? You must get tired of reading I love you so every other line—but anyway honey—I do love you—g’nite. [Transcription ends...|$|E
