The 9th Battalion, furthest south, was to attack the artillery battery at Gaba Tepe, and the 12th Battalion was the reserve, with 26th Jacob's Mountain Battery to establish their gun line on <b>the</b> <b>plateau.</b> Unknown to the ANZACs, the Turks had an artillery battery sited on 400 Plateau.|$|E
