2500|$|The Atlantic Limited saw {{the first}} major change to its route around 1970 when the Saint John Union Station was {{demolished}} and CPR's Mill Street yard redeveloped to accommodate the Saint John <b>Throughway</b> and associated urban redevelopment. [...] A new passenger station {{was built on the}} city's west side in the former city of Lancaster where new rail yards were developed. [...] During the 1970s, CPR operated the service at minimal levels with usually a single 1800-class E8 locomotive (one of only three, later two, operated in Canada, both by CPR) and a baggage, coach, diner, and sleeper car. [...] Some of the stainless steel Budd Company cars originally ordered for The Canadian also made their way onto this train and there was infrequent availability of a dome car as well.|$|E

50|$|In Alberta, {{the generic}} Trail {{is often used}} to {{describe}} a freeway, expressway or major urban street (for example, Deerfoot Trail, Macleod Trail or Crowchild Trail in Calgary, Yellowhead Trail in Edmonton). The British term motorway is not used. The American terms turnpike and tollway for a toll road are not common. The term <b>throughway</b> or thruway was used for first tolled limited-access highways (for example, the Deas Island <b>Throughway,</b> now Highway 99, from Vancouver, BC, to Blaine, Washington, USA or the Saint John <b>Throughway</b> (Highway 1) in Saint John, NB), but this term is not common anymore. In everyday speech, when a particular roadway is not being specified, the term highway is generally or exclusively used.|$|E

50|$|Initially, {{the plan}} was to lay out the streets in a {{traditional}} grid formation.

These major streets would later {{come to be known as}} Wilhelmstraße, Friedrichstraße and Lindenstraße. According to a royal patent from July 29, 1734, the location of a large square on Wilhelmstraße was also among the construction projects discussed.|$|R
50|$|In 1937-1938, {{the bridge}} was reconstructed to the design by Yu.F.Werner (structural engineering), N.B.Sokolov and Yakovlev {{brothers}} (architectural design). They raised the deck by 2.7 meters, which increased water clearance 8.6 meters high, 30 meters wide (for heavy barge traffic after completion of Moscow Canal). This also enabled separating embankment and bridge traffic in two levels (street-level <b>throughways</b> under main deck), total length with ramps reached 502 meters. Timber pavement was replaced with concrete and asphalt.|$|R

25|$|Planning {{and design}} is {{currently}} underway for 500 and 700 North, ShelbyHurst's newest properties. With construction {{set to begin}} later this year, these properties will have between 100,000 and 130,000 square feet of Louisville's most prestigious office space. ShelbyHurst was designed around a four-lane boulevard through the campus bordered by bike lanes and wide attractive sidewalks. Special attention was given to enhancing green space and improving {{the life of the}} surrounding community. The green design of the entire development, combined with the convenience of a new boulevard and modern <b>throughways,</b> will facilitate driving, walking and biking through the campus.|$|R
