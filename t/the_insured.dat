5|$|Typhoon Maemi left about 1.47million {{electric}} customers {{without power}} around the country, causing ₩12.9billion (KRW, $11.61million USD) in damage to power companies. Widespread damage interrupted mobile and cell phone service. United States {{military bases in}} the country sustained about $4.5million in damage. Nationwide, Maemi destroyed about 5,000houses and damaged 13,000homes and businesses, leaving 25,000people homeless. About 150businesses in Gangwon Province were destroyed by Typhoon Rusa in 2002, only to be destroyed again by Maemi when they were rebuilt. Insured damages from Maemi were estimated at ₩650billion (KRW, $565million), mostly property damage. <b>The</b> <b>insured</b> damage was over four {{times the amount of}} insured damage from Typhoon Rusa the year prior. Overall damage was estimated at ₩5.52trillion (KRW, $4.8billion USD). By comparison, this total was ₩2.52trillion (KRW, $1.9billion USD) less than Rusa; the discrepancy between <b>the</b> <b>insured</b> and overall damage was due to Maemi causing heavier industrial damage, while Rusa caused more damage overall.

5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 1, {{hurricane}} warnings were issued for the northwest Bahamas while hurricane watches were issued for the lower east coast of Florida and tropical storm watches were issued for the Florida Keys. There was the potential for catastrophic damage along Florida's heavily populated east coast, with warnings that damages from Frances could exceed <b>the</b> <b>insured</b> losses of Hurricane Andrew. These damage estimates were in anticipation that Frances would strike Florida as a strong Category Four hurricane. Preparations for the storm were stepped up in Florida on September 1. Governor Jeb Bush {{declared a state of}} emergency, Kennedy Space Center closed down, and evacuations of 500,000people were initially ordered. Eventually 41 counties received evacuation orders, covering 2.8million residents, the largest evacuation in Florida's history. The state education system also responded to the pending crisis. Many universities across Florida canceled classes. Both the University of Central Florida and the University of North Florida told all students to leave their dorms. Evacuation at the University of South Florida was performed on a dorm-by-dorm basis. Florida Atlantic University was closed for a week and a half. Most schools were shut down from southern Miami-Dade County to just south of Melbourne two days before the hurricane. The annual Florida State University-University of Miami college football game was rescheduled for the following week.|$|E

The protection offered by a liability insurance policy is twofold: a legal defense {{in the event of a}} lawsuit commenced against the policyholder and indemnification (payment on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>insured)</b> with respect to a settlement or court verdict.

The first randomised study on <b>the</b> <b>INSURE</b> method was published in 1994 and a second randomised study in infants less than 30 weeks gestation was published by the group in 1999. In the last 15 years Verder has worked with lung maturity diagnostics on gastric aspirates obtained at birth. By combining this diagnostic method with INSURE, Verder has worked to further improve the clinical outcome of RDS.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{included}} two overarching objectives. Through a systematic {{review of the}} literature published between 1990 and 2012, the first objective aimed to assess whether <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured would result in higher costs compared to <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> currently <b>insured.</b> Studies that quantified the actual costs associated with <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured in the U. S. were included. Based upon 2009 data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), the second objective aimed to assess and compare the self-reported health of populations with four different insurance statuses. The second part of this study involved a secondary data analysis of both currently insured and currently uninsured individuals who participated in the MEPS in 2009. The null hypothesis was that there were no differences across the four categories of health insurance status for self-reported health status and healthcare service use. The alternative hypothesis was that were differences across the four categories of health insurance status for self-reported health status and healthcare service use. Methods: For the systematic review, three databases were searched using search terms to identify studies that actually quantified <b>the</b> cost of <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured. Thirteen studies were selected, discussed, and summarized in tables. For the secondary data analysis of MEPS data, this study compared four categories of health insurance status: (1) currently uninsured persons who will become eligible for Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) healthcare reforms in 2014; (2) currently uninsured persons who will be required to buy private insurance through the PPACA health insurance exchanges in 2014; (3) persons currently insured under Medicaid or SCHIP; and (4) persons currently insured with private insurance. The four categories were compared on the basis of demographic information, health status information, and health conditions with relatively high prevalence. Chi-square tests were run to determine if there were differences between the four groups in regard to health insurance status and health status. With some exceptions, <b>the</b> two currently <b>insured</b> groups had worse self-reported health status compared to the two currently uninsured groups. Results: The thirteen studies that met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review included: (1) three cost studies from 1993, 1995, and 1997; (2) four cost studies from 2001, 2003, and 2004; (3) one study of disabilities and one study of immigrants; (4) two state specific studies of uninsured status; and (5) two current studies of healthcare reform. Of the thirteen studies reviewed, four directly addressed the study question about whether <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured was more or less expensive than <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> currently <b>insured.</b> All four of the studies provided support for the study finding that <b>the</b> cost of <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured would generally not be higher than insuring those already insured. One study indicated that <b>the</b> cost of <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured would be less expensive than <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> population currently covered by Medicaid, but more expensive to <b>insure</b> than <b>the</b> populations of those covered by employer-sponsored insurance and non-group private insurance. While the nine other studies included in the systematic review discussed the costs associated with <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured population, they did not directly compare <b>the</b> costs of <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured population with the costs associated with <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> currently <b>insured</b> population. For <b>the</b> MEPS secondary data analysis, the results of the chi-square tests indicated that there were differences in the distribution of disease status by health insurance status. As anticipated, with some exceptions, the uninsured reported lower rates of disease and healthcare service use. However, for the variable attention deficit disorder, the uninsured reported higher disease rates than <b>the</b> two <b>insured</b> groups. Additionally, for the variables high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and joint pain, <b>the</b> currently <b>insured</b> under Medicaid or SCHIP group reported a lower rate of disease than <b>the</b> two currently <b>insured</b> groups. This result {{may be due to the}} lower mean age of <b>the</b> currently <b>insured</b> under Medicaid or SCHIP group. Conclusion: Based on this study, with some exceptions, <b>the</b> costs for <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured should not exceed healthcare-related costs for <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> currently uninsured. The results of the systematic review indicated that the U. S. is already paying some of the costs associated with <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured. PPACA will expand health insurance coverage to millions of Americans who are currently uninsured, as the individual mandate and insurance market reforms will require. Because many of the currently uninsured are relatively healthy young persons, the costs associated with expanding insurance coverage to the uninsured are anticipated to be relatively modest. However, for the purposes of construing these results, it is important to note that once individuals obtain insurance, it is anticipated that they will use more healthcare services, which will increase costs.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Evidence {{suggests}} <b>the</b> <b>INSURE</b> strategy (INtubate-SURfactant {{administration and}} Extubate to nasal continuous positive airway pressure [nCPAP]) {{is superior to}} mechanical ventilation (MV) with rescue surfactant {{for the management of}} respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates. There is limited data, however, to assess whether INSURE is superior to nCPAP alone. We aimed to compare these two strategies regarding early and late outcomes. Methods: Retrospective cohort study from Jan/ 2002 to Aug/ 2008. We included VLBW neonateswith gestational age (GA) ≤ 30 weeks registered in the Vermont Oxford Network that used either nCPAP alone (nCPAP group, N= 40), or with INSURE (INSURE group, N= 56). We assessed early (RDS, need for rescue surfactant, and CPAP failure with MV) and late outcomes (chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD), mortality, and composite outcome of mortality and/or CLD). Results: Neonates in <b>the</b> <b>INSURE</b> group had lower mean GA, while other baseline variables were comparable. The proportion of RDS was significantly superior in the nCPAP group (53 % vs. 30 %; adjusted OR [95 % CI] – 0. 2 [0. 1 - 0. 6]). Therapeutic surfactant was administered to all cases with RDS in the nCPAP group, but to none from <b>the</b> <b>INSURE</b> group. MV was more frequently required in the nCPAP group (11 / 40, 28 % vs. 9 / 56, 12 %; p= 0. 04). No statistically significant differences were found in either of the late outcomes. Conclusion: The use of nCPAP alone in VLBW neonates with GA≤ 30 weeks may be associated with slightly poorer early outcomes than <b>the</b> <b>INSURE</b> strategy, but {{there were no significant differences}} in CLD or mortality.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to define the optimal {{branding}} strategy for a new product; <b>the</b> <b>InSure</b> FIT Test; into an existing company with a well-known brand; HemoCue AB. This product {{will be the first}} in a row of new products that HemoCue will distribute, that has not been developed and manufactured by the company. Design management refers to an approach whereby organizations make design-relevant decisions in a market and customer-oriented way as well as optimizing design-relevant processes. The thesis uses a design management approach by analyzing the brand, defining the customer and their wants and needs, and identifying the added values of the product. The brand is analyzed first, and three different branding alternatives are presented, namely brand extension, co-branding and distribution only. Face-to-face interviews are performed with both internal and external customers of HemoCue AB to understand their image of the company. The customers’ images are compared to the identity that the company wants to transmit. After this the customers of <b>the</b> <b>InSure</b> products are identified, and Persona for the different customers are created. The creation of persona enables us to understand the users’ wants and needs. Last <b>the</b> <b>InSure</b> product is analyzed, identifying how it fits into the Mission, Vision and other statements that HemoCue makes. From the information gathered SWOT analyses are performed on each branding alternative. The most important criterion are weighted and the branding alternatives are weighted in regards to the branding alternatives. The conclusion is made that the co-branding alternative is the optimal branding solution for the HemoCue company, as well as providing several benefits for <b>the</b> <b>InSure</b> product. This suggested branding solution may also be useable for the future portfolio extensions in the HemoCue and Quest Diagnostic companies...|$|R
