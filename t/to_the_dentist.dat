5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, {{going back to}} director Andrew Stanton's childhood, when he loved going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dentist</b> to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992, shortly after his son was born, {{he and his family}} took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.|$|E

The two go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dentist</b> office {{only to be}} kicked out. When the dentist departs on a cruise the two tramps then pose as dentists and occupy the office and pull teeth with pincers and tongs. When the rightful owners return they drive off again. The tramps continue in their venture and quickly make a large sum of money before they desire their old way of life. The two tramps then surrender the office to its rightful owners.|$|E

50|$|CAD/CAM {{dentistry}} {{involves a}} digital impression {{from one or}} more scans (using visible light scanning, digital radiographs, CT scans, or other methods), designing the restoration on the computer (computer-aided design, leading to a 3D model), and manufacturing the restoration (computer-aided manufacturing, whether by CNC milling, 3D printing, or other means). In order to carry all of these steps out in <b>the</b> <b>dentist’s</b> office - chairside - <b>the</b> <b>dentist</b> requires an image acquisition unit with an intraoral camera, the corresponding designing software, and a milling machine or a printer. If <b>the</b> <b>dentist</b> {{does not have a}} milling unit in their office, they can send the data in a digital file <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dental laboratory via an online portal.

The makeup took 4.5 hours to apply and 1.5 hours to remove. Burton explained, [...] "it's like going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dentist</b> at two in the morning and having people poke at you for hours. Then you wear an ape costume until nine at night." [...] Burton was adamant that the apes should be substantially [...] "more animal-like; flying through trees, climb walls, swing out of windows, and go ape shit when angry." [...] For a month and a half before shooting started, the actors who portrayed apes attended [...] "ape school". Industrial Light & Magic, Rhythm and Hues Studios and Animal Logic were commissioned for the visual effects sequences.

To enhance the dental theme of the song, Yankovic called in his actual dentist, who brought a real drill and a human tooth, which the two took turns drilling while recording to create a genuine sound effect. The second parody was a pastiche of TLC's hit [...] "Waterfalls" [...] called [...] "Phony Calls", about prank calls. During the bridge, a clip from The Simpsons second season episode [...] "Blood Feud" [...] is played on top of the music.

[...] The next parody {{recorded for}} the album was [...] "Gump", a parody of [...] "Lump" [...] by The Presidents of the United States of America.

2500|$|The {{fabrication}} {{of a set}} of complete dentures is a challenge for any dentist/denturist. [...] There are many axioms in the production of dentures that must be understood; ignorance of one axiom can lead to failure of the denture. [...] In the vast majority of cases, complete dentures should be comfortable soon after insertion, although almost always at least two adjustment visits are necessary to remove the cause of sore spots. [...] One of the most critical aspects of dentures is that the impression of the denture must be perfectly made and used with perfect technique to make an accurate model of the patient's edentulous (toothless) gums. [...] The dentist or denturist must use a process called border molding to ensure that the denture flanges are properly extended. [...] An array of problems may occur if the final impression of the denture is not made properly. It takes considerable patience and experience for a dentist to know how to make a denture, and for this reason it may be in the patient's best interest to seek a specialist, either a prosthodontist or denturist, to make the denture. A denturist is a trained and licensed professional who sees patients in need of dentures, partials, relines or repairs. A denturist not only takes the impression, but makes the entire denture {{in his or her own}} laboratory. The denturist then schedules a date for the delivery of the finished dentures to the patient. A general dentist may do a good job making dentures, but only if he or she is meticulous and experienced. Many dentists no longer make dentures themselves. but instead take an impression of the patients' mouth and then either send the impressions to a dental laboratory, which could be anywhere in the world, or send the patient to a denturist. Once the laboratory receives dental impressions of the patient's mouth, the laboratory creates plaster molds from them. [...] The laboratory uses the molds to create the wax rims used to register the patient's bite. [...] These wax rims are returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dentist,</b> who uses them to register the patient's bite. [...] The dentist may assist the patient in choosing the correct size of teeth for the dentures, or simply make the selection himself. [...] Once bite registration is completed and the teeth are selected for the dentures, the wax rim is usually returned to the dental laboratory in order to have the denture teeth set into the wax. [...] Once the teeth are set into the wax rim, the result is a prefinished denture that looks almost like the finished product. This prefinished denture is usually returned to the dentist's office and the patient usually has a chance to approve the setup (for immediate or standard dentures) or to try the denture before it is finished. After approval by the patient, the dentist returns the pre-denture to the laboratory for final processing. The finished denture is then returned to the dentist's office for delivery to the patient.|$|E
