AIDS is a pandemic. In 2007, an estimated 33.2million people lived with the disease worldwide, and it killed an estimated 2.1million people, including 330,000 children. Over three-quarters of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
25|$|Chlamydia, human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV), gonorrhea, herpes, hepatitis (multiple strains), and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), {{can be transmitted}} through oral sex. Any sexual exchange of bodily fluids with a person infected with HIV, the virus <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS,</b> poses a risk of infection. Risk of STI infection, however, is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex, with HIV transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, a Kaiser Family Foundation {{study found}} that 95% of public {{secondary}} schools offered sex education programs. More {{than half of the}} schools in the study followed a comprehensive approach that included information about both abstinence and contraception, while approximately one third of schools provided students with abstinence-only sex education. In 2002, most Americans favored the comprehensive approach. A 2000 {{study found that}} almost all schools included information about HIV, the virus <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS,</b> in their curricula. There have been efforts among social conservatives in the US government to limit sex education in public schools to abstinence-only sex education curricula. The effectiveness of abstinence-only programs has been an issue of controversy.|$|E

25|$|HIV, the {{retrovirus}} <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS</b> in humans, {{produces a}} single primary RNA transcript, which is alternatively spliced in multiple ways to produce over 40 different mRNAs. Equilibrium among differentially spliced transcripts provides multiple mRNAs encoding different {{products that are}} required for viral multiplication. One of the differentially spliced transcripts contains the tat gene, in which exon 2 is a cassette exon that may be skipped or included. The inclusion of tat exon 2 in the RNA is regulated by competition between the splicing repressor hnRNP A1 and the SR protein SC35. Within exon 2 an exonic splicing silencer sequence (ESS) and an exonic splicing enhancer sequence (ESE) overlap. If A1 repressor protein binds to the ESS, it initiates cooperative binding of multiple A1 molecules, extending into the 5’ donor site upstream of exon 2 and preventing the binding of the core splicing factor U2AF35 to the polypyrimidine tract. If SC35 binds to the ESE, it prevents A1 binding and maintains the 5’ donor site in an accessible state for assembly of the spliceosome. Competition between the activator and repressor ensures that both mRNA types (with and without exon 2) are produced.|$|E
500|$|Healthy {{for most}} of his childhood, he became {{extremely}} ill with pneumonia in December 1984. On December 17, 1984, during a lung biopsy, Ryan was diagnosed with AIDS. By this time the scientific community had studied the epidemic in great detail. Earlier that year that HTLV-III was identified and isolated by American research scientists, confirming the work done by French research scientists who called it LAV. A lengthy public battle to determine who should be recognized as the discover of the human retro virus delayed development of a test for what would later be called HIV. Ryan had apparently received a contaminated treatment of FactorVIII that was infected with HIV, as did thousands of other Americans with hemophilia and hemophiliacs around the world. At that time, because the retrovirus <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS</b> had been recently identified, much of the pooled Factor VIII concentrate [...] was tainted. Blood banks and pharmaceuticals dismissed calls by the CDC to use a Hepatitis B test as a surrogate until a HIV test could be developed. Late plasma products were screen and heat treated to deactivate both HIV and Hepatitis. Among hemophiliacs treated with blood-clotting factors between 1979 and 1984, nearly 90% became infected with HIV and/or Hepatitis C. At the time of his diagnosis, his T-cell count had dropped to 25 (a healthy individual without HIV will have around 5001200). Doctors predicted Ryan White had only six months to live.|$|E
2500|$|The 2008 award went to Harald zur Hausen [...] in {{recognition}} of his discovery that human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause cervical cancer, and to Françoise Barré-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier for discovering the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Whether Robert Gallo or Luc Montagnier deserved more credit for {{the discovery of the}} virus <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS</b> has been a matter of considerable controversy. As it was, Gallo was left out and not awarded a prize. Additionally, there was scandal when it was learned that Harald zur Hausen was being investigated for having a financial interest in vaccines for the cervical cancer that HPV can cause. AstraZeneca, who with a stake in two lucrative HPV vaccines could benefit financially from the prize, had agreed to sponsor Nobel Media and Nobel Web. According to Times Online, two senior figures in the selection process that chose zur Hausen also had strong links with AstraZeneca.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} studies reveal that effectiveness of aid on growth is ambiguous. The authors consider aid proliferation-excess aid investment relative to recurrent cost-as a potential <b>cause</b> <b>that</b> undermines <b>aid</b> effectiveness, because aid projects can only produce sustainable benefits when sufficient recurrent costs are disbursed. They consider the donor's budget support as {{a device to}} supplement the shortage of the recipient's recurrent cost and to alleviate the misallocation of inputs. However, when donors have self-interested preferences {{for the success of}} their own projects over those conducted by others, they provide insufficient budget support relative to aid, which results in aid proliferation. Moreover, aid proliferation is shown to be worsened by the presence of more donors. Copyright � 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation � 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

In this paper, we argue that if the aid is used productively, there are both short and long term gains. Applying a recursive dynamic general equilibrium model on Uganda, we find that while the currency appreciates and some exports decline, the overall impact on growth outweighs the losses in competitiveness. In addition, it aid is used productively, poverty would be substantially reduced as long as the aid increase is sustained.

40|$|Recent {{research}} yields widely divergent {{estimates of}} the cross-country relationship between foreign aid receipts and economic growth. We propose and test two reasons for this divergence, both of which relate to the timing of effects between aid and growth.

Second, they have sought to reduce the bias from contemporaneous reverse causation {{with the use of}} instrumental variables that appear to be invalid, weak, or both. We reanalyze data from the three most influential published aid-growth studies, strictly conserving their regression specifications, adding sensible assumptions about timing and avoiding questionable instruments. With these changes, the research designs from all of these studies yield one finding: that increases in aid have been followed on average by modest increases in investment and growth.
