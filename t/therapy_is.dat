5|$|Chelation <b>therapy</b> <b>is</b> used {{in cases}} of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for people with blood lead levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation for people with symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood lead levels is more controversial. Chelation <b>therapy</b> <b>is</b> of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. Chelation <b>therapy</b> <b>is</b> usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E
5|$|Even after {{complete}} remission is achieved, leukemic cells likely remain in numbers {{too small to}} be detected with current diagnostic techniques. If no further postremission or consolidation <b>therapy</b> <b>is</b> given, almost all people with AML will eventually relapse. Therefore, more <b>therapy</b> <b>is</b> necessary to eliminate nondetectable disease and prevent relapse— that is, to achieve a cure.|$|E
5|$|First-line {{treatment}} of AML consists primarily of chemotherapy, and {{is divided into}} two phases: induction and postremission (or consolidation) therapy. The goal of induction <b>therapy</b> <b>is</b> to achieve a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level; the goal of consolidation <b>therapy</b> <b>is</b> to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses, although transplantation is also sometimes used as front-line therapy for people with high-risk disease. Efforts to use tyrosine kinase inhibitors in AML continue.|$|E

Respondents of this study were families where 48 clients with social isolation devided as random sampling consist of 24 respondents who got family psycho education therapy as the intervention group and 24 respondents who did not get family psycho education therapy as control group.

The Alexander technique appears useful for chronic back pain, and there is tentative evidence to support the use of yoga. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has not been found to be {{effective in}} chronic low back pain. Evidence for the use of shoe insoles as a treatment is inconclusive. Peripheral nerve stimulation, a minimally-invasive procedure, may be useful in cases of chronic low back pain that do not respond to other measures, although the evidence supporting it is not conclusive, and it is not effective for pain that radiates into the leg.|$|E
