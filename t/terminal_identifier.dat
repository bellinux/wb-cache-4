50|$|The SPID is a {{numeric string}} from 3 to 20 digits in length. A SPID (or more than one, if necessary) is {{assigned}} when the ISDN Basic Rate Interface (BRI) is {{obtained from the}} phone company. Beginning in 1998, most phone companies began to use a generic SPID format. In this format, the SPID is a 14-digit number that includes a 10-digit telephone number (which includes the 3-digit Numbering Plan Area code), a 2-digit Sharing <b>Terminal</b> <b>Identifier,</b> and a 2-digit <b>Terminal</b> <b>Identifier</b> (TID). The generic SPID format {{makes it easier to}} tell users what to specify when installing an ISDN line and simplifies corporate installation procedures.|$|E
50|$|<b>Terminal</b> <b>Identifier</b> - Address Resolution Protocol (TARP) is a {{protocol}} defined in Telcordia Technologies (formerly Bellcore) Generic Requirements document GR-253-CORE for SONET {{and used in}} OSS to resolve a TL1 TID to a CLNP address (NSAP) of a Network Element (NE). The protocol is used {{in a number of}} network devices. Steven R. Kim originally developed the protocol while working for Fujitsu Network Systems.|$|E

By applying a Bloom filter, the <b>terminal</b> <b>identifier</b> field of a paging message is coded to page a number of terminals concurrently. A small number of terminals may wake up and send what we call “false location updates ” although {{they are not being}} paged. We compare the total number of paging and false location update messages with the cost of the standard paging procedure. Fortunately, the false location update probabilities can be made very small, and important bandwidth gains can be expected. The larger the size of the <b>terminal</b> <b>identifier,</b> the less probable are false location updates. Therefore, hash-based paging especially shows promise for IP paging in mobile IPv 6 networks with 128 -bit mobile host addresses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Paging is an {{important}} mechanism for network bandwidth efficiency and mobile terminal battery life. It has been widely adopted by mobile networks, such as cellular networks, WiMax, and Mobile IP. Due to certain mechanisms for achieving paging efficiency and the convergence of wireless voice and data networks, the paging channel is vulnerable to inexpensive DoS attacks. To mitigate these attacks, we propose to leverage {{the knowledge of the}} user population size, the slotted nature of the paging operation, and the quick paging mechanism to reduce the length of <b>terminal</b> <b>identifiers.</b> In the case of a CDMA 2000 system, we can reduce each identifier from 34 bits down to 7 bits, effectively doubling the paging channel capacity. Moreover, our scheme incurs no paging latency, missed pages, or false pages. Using a simulator and data collected from a commercial cellular network, we demonstrate that our scheme doubles the cost for DoS attackers...|$|R

The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Q. 921 -User Adaptation Layer (IUA) Protocol, described in RFC 4233, defines the message type of <b>Terminal</b> Endpoint <b>Identifier</b> (TEI) Query Request messages as 5.

40|$|Air {{traffic in}} {{terminal}} air space is very complex, making {{it very difficult}} to identify air traffic flows. Finding air traffic flows and flow boundaries are very helpful in analyzing how air traffic would react to weather. This thesis created the <b>Terminal</b> Traffic Flow <b>Identifier</b> algorithm to solve this problem. The algorithm was demonstrated to work in the Atlanta by quickly processing 20, 000 sample trajectories and returning accurate flows with tight boundaries. This thesis also created techniques to extract weather features that occur inside the identified flows and demonstrated that training upon these features give good results. The algorithms and software created in this thesis may soon be incorporated into larger traffic managements systems developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. by Tony Ng. Thesis (M. Eng.)

30|$|For the {{congestion}} {{in random}} access, Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) resources of LTE are deemed sufficient in most communication scenarios. To ease the congestion {{on the air}} interface, those downlink assignments and uplink grants for MTC devices, which cannot be served by Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH), can be aggregated into a transport block on PDSCH identified by a special radio network <b>terminal</b> <b>identifier</b> (RNTI) called MTC-RNTI [80]. MTC devices monitor PDCCH channel with their own cell RNTI and MTC-RNTI simultaneously. Game theory {{has been used for}} the context of cellular M 2 M to optimize preamble allocation [81]. In addition, a detailed random access related proposals are summarized in [15], which can be a complement of our categorization.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{relentless}} {{growth of}} Internet, which {{has resulted in}} the increase of routing table sizes, requires consideration and new direction to address Internet scalability and resiliency. A possible direction is {{to move away from the}} flat legacy Internet routing to hierarchical routing, and introduce two-level hierarchical routing between edge networks and across transit networks. In this way, there is also an opportunity to separate the routing locator from the <b>terminal</b> <b>identifier,</b> to better manage IP mobility and mitigate important routing security issues. In this paper, we study the extended traffic engineering capabilities arising in a transit-edge hierarchical routing, focusing on those multi-homed edge networks (e. g., Cloud/content providers) that aim at increasing their Internet resiliency experience. We model the interaction between distant independent edge networks exchanging large traffic volumes using game theory, with the goal of seeking efficient edge-to-edge load-balancing solutions. The proposed traffic engineering framework relies on a non-cooperative potential game, built upon locator and path ranking costs, that indicates efficient equilibrium solution for the edge-to-edge load-balancing coordination problem. Simulations on real instances show that in comparison to the available standard protocols such as BGP and LISP, we can achieve a much higher degree of resiliency and stability...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{interest}} in delay/disruption tolerant networking (DTN) is growing {{as a means of}} communication in times of disaster. To ensure that a DTN works well in an emergency, it is desirable to promote general use of the DTN, so that it will also be used in normal times. Since the DTN uses mobile terminals and vehicles, which are not dedicated network devices, as relay nodes, the routing method should be such that it does not impose a large processing load on relay nodes. This paper considers use of a DTN for a day-to-day service of delivering content to a specific area and proposes a new routing method that is based on information about the routes of fixed-route traveling nodes, such as public transportation vehicles. The destination of a bundle is specified not by a <b>terminal</b> <b>identifier,</b> but by an area, which is identified by its location information. This paper presents an outbound-type bundle protocol, which is used by relay nodes when they have received a forwarding-bundle request from a sending terminal and try to determine whether the bundle can reach its destination area. Using simulation, the superiority of the proposed routing was confirmed by comparing it to existing routing methods in terms of the bundle arrival rate and factors that affect the network load, such as the number of bundle copies, the number of hops and the maximum required buffer size...|$|E
50|$|A {{proprietary}} {{communications protocol}} was {{common to all}} members of the Uniscope product line. Groups of terminals were generally dropped off a common communications line via a multiplexer (mux) and identified by remote identifier and station <b>identifier</b> symbols. Some <b>terminals</b> may have been equipped with peripheral devices such as printers and recording devices (cartridge tape or floppy disk) which were identified on the communications line by a device <b>identifier.</b> <b>Terminals</b> on a drop were sequentially polled for traffic, sometimes with a general poll to which any terminal with traffic could respond. A fairly complex data presentation protocol permitted application programmers to format a screen for any number of business purposes. For example, fields could be described that would accept only numeric or alpha-numeric characters. Some fields could not be changed by the terminal operator. A protocol extension permitted programmers to specify color for each field and lines on the borders of each cell (underline, or vertical bars, etc.) The Uniscope display protocol, while proprietary, roughly parallel the ANSI X3.64 standard.|$|R
