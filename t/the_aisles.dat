5|$|Though more seats {{had been}} added to the synagogue by {{narrowing}} <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> as a result of Sparger's innovations Beth Elohim outgrew its Pearl Street building, and a new one was sought. After a three-year search, in 1885 Beth Elohim purchased the building of the Congregational Church at 305 State Street (near Hoyt) for $28,000 (today $), and moved in that year.|$|E

5|$|Located on College Green, {{the cathedral}} has tall Gothic windows and pinnacled skyline. The eastern end is a hall church in which <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> {{are the same}} height as the Choir and share the Lierne vaults. The late Norman chapter house, {{situated}} south of the transept, contains {{some of the first}} uses of pointed arches in England. In addition to the cathedral's architectural features, it contains several memorials and an historic organ. Little of the original stained glass remains with some being replaced in the Victorian era and further losses during the Bristol Blitz.|$|E
5|$|West fronts {{in general}} take three {{distinct}} forms: those that follow {{the elevation of}} the nave and aisles, those that have paired towers {{at the end of}} each aisle, framing the nave, and those that screen the form of the building. The west front at Wells has the paired-tower form, unusual in that the towers do not indicate the location of <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> but extend well beyond them, screening the dimensions and profile of the building.|$|E
5|$|With two exceptions, the naves {{and eastern}} {{arms of the}} cathedrals have single lower aisles on either side with a {{clerestory}} that illuminates the central space. At Bristol <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> are {{at the same height}} as the medieval choir like some German cathedrals, and at Chichester there are two aisles {{on either side of the}} nave like some French cathedrals. At a number of the cathedrals where the transepts are large they also have aisles, either on the eastern side as at Peterborough, Durham, Lincoln and Salisbury or both, as at Winchester, Wells, Ely and York.|$|E

5|$|Arcades of {{semi-circular}} arches {{divide the}} nave from <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b> On {{the south side}} of the cathedral, a large chapel, built in 1911, extends three bays parallel to the aisle. This chapel provides a more intimate place of worship than the main church or its aisles. The nave has a cross vaulted ceiling with clerestory windows above the arcades. The cathedral's main neoclassical altar of translucent alabaster is a modern replacement for the original wooden gothic altar, now located in the southern side chapel. The main altar, built in Burgos, Spain, was donated by the local Ferre family. Except for the side chapel where terrazzo is used, the cathedral's floor is of gray and white marble design.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Lagaan had a {{world premiere}} at the International Indian Film Academy Awards (IIFA) weekend in Sun City, South Africa. The Locarno International Film Festival {{authorities}} published {{the rules of}} cricket before the film was screened to a crowd which reportedly danced to its soundtrack in <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b> Lagaan was shown four times due to public demand as against the usual norm of showcasing films once at the festival. It subsequently won the Prix du Public award at the festival. After the film's publicity in Locarno, the director, Ashutosh Gowarikar said that distributors from Switzerland, Italy, France, Netherlands, North Africa, Finland and Germany were wanting to purchase the distribution rights. Special screenings were held in Russia, where people were keen to watch the film after its Oscar nomination.|$|E
5|$|St Margaret's Church has a chancel, wide nave with {{a narrow}} {{clerestory}} above and narrow three-bay aisles on {{the north and south}} sides, a tall tower (topped with a spire) at the west end and a porch on the north side. The nave, chancel and chancel-arch all date from the 13th century. <b>The</b> <b>aisles</b> and their arcades are largely unaltered from their 14th-century origins: between them they feature various mouldings and designs typical of that period, including chamfered arches, octagonal columns and squinch corners. Many of the windows also date from that century, while others are a century later; trefoil-headed designs predominate, but there are some larger square-headed Perpendicular Gothic windows as well. Several other windows contain stained glass. The roof of the nave is tall and steeply pitched, with substantial king posts and tie-beams. It is also of medieval origin.|$|E
50|$|The communion {{table was}} made in the 17th century. In the 18th century <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> was rebuilt in brick and a porch was added over a 12th-century doorway. In 1858 St. Nicolas' was {{drastically}} restored, with <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> and west front being rebuilt and the nave re-roofed. The rebuilding of the west front removed a 12th-century west doorway and a 15th-century west window above it. In 1884 the west tower was added at the west end of <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> <b>The</b> oak rood screen was added in 1905.|$|R
25|$|During Scott’s 1860 additions, {{what is now}} <b>the</b> north <b>aisle</b> west {{window of}} four lancets, {{contemporary}} with the 13th-century geometrical nave west windows, was re-sited from the original north wall of <b>the</b> nave. <b>The</b> <b>aisle</b> also contains Scott’s run of four windows on its long north side, all of three lancets with cinquefoils—lobes formed by the overlapping of five circles—set in a rosette above within a pointed head, and at the east one window of two lancets with a quatrefoil rosette above. Above <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> east and west windows are small glazed trefoil openings. Between the north wall windows, and at <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> corners, are buttresses with steeply angled double steps to the eaves of the slate roof, with their socles, or base plinths, continuing around the faces of <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> walls.|$|R

5|$|The nave and chancel {{are divided}} from <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> by seven-bay arcades, the piers being without capitals. At {{the top of}} each pier, facing the nave, is a carved human face. The roofs are divided into panels and contain much carving, {{including}} bosses (protrusions), shields, inscriptions and three pendants. The chapel at the west end of the south aisle is known as the Lady Chapel, and that on the north side is dedicated to Saint Mary. The church contains more medieval fittings and furniture than any other Cheshire church. Between the nave and the chancel is a screen, and there are parclose screens between <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> and the chapels. The chancel screen, dated 1500, is elaborately carved with representations of birds, roses, vines and foliage. It has ten bays with lierne vaulting. The chancel stalls and the carved wooden eagle lectern date from around the same period. The lectern {{is one of the oldest}} eagle lecterns in the United Kingdom. The stalls have hinged seats, and formerly had misericords (shelves to support a standing person). Much of the furniture dates from the 17thcentury and is in Jacobean style. This includes the altar rails, the octagonal pulpit, the box pews, the reredos (screen behind the altar) in the Lady Chapel, and the font cover. The font itself is Perpendicular. The reredos in the chancel of 1866 was designed by the Manchester architect J. S. Crowther.|$|E
5|$|The sculptures on {{the west}} front at Wells include {{standing}} figures, seated figures, half-length angels and narratives in high relief. Many of the figures are life-sized or larger, and together they constitute the finest display of medieval carving in England. The figures {{and many of the}} architectural details were painted in bright colours, and the colouring scheme has been deduced from flakes of paint still adhering to some surfaces. The sculptures occupy nine architectural zones stretching horizontally across the entire west front and around the sides and the eastern returns of the towers which extend beyond <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b> The strongly projecting buttresses have tiers of niches which contain many of the largest figures. Other large figures, including that of Christ, occupy the gable. A single figure stands in one of two later niches high on the northern tower.|$|E
5|$|The vault of {{the nave}} rises steeply {{in a simple}} quadripartite form, {{in harmony with the}} nave arcade. The eastern end of the choir was {{extended}} and the whole upper part elaborated {{in the second quarter of}} the 14th century by William Joy. The vault has a multiplicity of ribs in a net-like form, which is very different from that of the nave, and is perhaps a recreation in stone of a local type of compartmented wooden roof of which examples remain from the 15th century, including those at St Cuthbert's Church, Wells. The vaults of <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> of the choir also have a unique pattern.|$|E

5|$|The work clearly {{distinguishes between}} {{figures of the}} divine, earthly and hellish realms. Perhaps {{following}} Jan van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece, the polyptych wings form an inverted T-shape. When the shutters are closed the panels resemble an upside-down cross, a form common in 15th-century carved retables: an elevated central panel allowed additional space for a narrative scene, to depict a heavenly vista, a single large figure, or a crucifixion with space for the cross to extend above the other panels, an innovation seen in van der Weyden's Descent from the Cross. This shape echoes typical configuration of Gothic churches, where the naves often extended past <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> into the apse or choir. The imagery of the outer panels {{is set in the}} earthly realm with the donors, and saints painted in grisaille to imitate sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Chester Cathedral has an east-west axis, {{common to}} many cathedrals, with the chancel {{at the eastern}} end, and the façade to the west. The plan is cruciform, with a central tower (as is usual in English monastic churches), but is asymmetrical, having a small {{transept}} {{on the north side}} remaining from an earlier building, and an unusually large south transept. As the plan shows, the asymmetry extends to the west front, where the north tower remains from the Norman building, and the south tower is of the early 16thcentury. At the eastern end, the symmetrical arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> was lost when the end of the south aisle was demolished and rebuilt in an apsidal shape. The nave, choir and south transept have wide aisles on either side, and are lit by clerestory windows and large multi-light windows {{in each of the three}} cliff-like ends. To the north of the cathedral are monastic buildings, including the cloister, refectory and a rectangular chapter house. The façade of the building is abutted on the north by later buildings.|$|E
5|$|The priory was rebuilt around 1200 on {{a larger}} scale with the Romanesque church {{demolished}} to its first course of ashlar. The construction of the new church continued through much of the 13th century. The enlarged priory had twin towers at the west end flanking a large double doorway above which was a central rose window; piped water was provided using lead pipes from the cloister, under the church to buildings or standpipes to the north or west of the priory. The main body of the church comprised a nave with two aisles, transepts and a choir. <b>The</b> <b>aisles</b> were laid with geometric coloured tiles adjoining the sandstone columns of the nave. The north aisle was divided into alcoves or private chapels where a number of people – probably local nobles and gentry – were buried. An unusual feature of the church was a well, sunk into the nave, possibly built in an effort to safeguard its water supplies.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{northern}} <b>aisle</b> {{is partially}} preserved. The roof and vaults crumbled long time ago, but the outer walls with {{the remains of}} the vaults and windows are still visible. <b>The</b> <b>aisle</b> was apparently built on a different principle from the main chancel. The most obvious difference is the difference between the system and rhythm of the windows and the buttress system. The chancel walls are designed as a skeletal system with the windows reaching almost from one pillar to the next one, providing a huge amount of light inside of the chancel, whereas the windows of <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> are relatively smaller and do not fill the whole space between the pillars. The pillars of the main chancel also do not interact logically with the inner space of <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> This was caused by the changes in plans between the two phases of building <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> and <b>the</b> chancel around 1379. The builders decided to make the chancel taller, which resulted in enlarging of the buttress system.|$|R
