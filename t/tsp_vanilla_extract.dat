50|$|<b>Vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> is a {{solution}} containing the flavor compound vanillin as the primary ingredient. Pure <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> is made by macerating and percolating vanilla pods in {{a solution}} of ethanol and water. In the United States, {{in order for a}} <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> to be called pure, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that the solution contains a minimum of 35% alcohol and 100g of vanilla beans per litre (13.35 ounces per gallon).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to observe vanillin retention and color changes during storage of concentrated <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> at the low temperature (10 °C), room temperature (30 °C), and high temperature (55 °C) for 49 days. The methodology of this research consisted of vanilla curing process, vanilla extraction, evaporation of <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract,</b> formulation of concentrated <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract,</b> and measuring the vanillin retention and color change. The best products of concentrated <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> were made with formula containing 10 ml <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract,</b> 10 ml high fructose syrup (HFS) 55 % and 3 ml of carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMC) solution 1 % and that made with formula containing 10 ml <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract,</b> 15 ml glucose syrup 75 °Brix and 3 ml of CMC solution 1 %. The vanillin retention of both formulas had a trend to descrease. The pattern of vanillin retention and color change during storage of both formulas followed linear equations. Thetemperature and period of storage significantly affected the color of concentrated <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract.</b> Both formulas did not show any differences in vanillin retention and color during storage at refrigerator and room temperature...|$|R
50|$|Under the Food and Drug Regulations (C.R.C., c. 870), <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> {{products}} {{have to be}} processed from vanilla beans: Vanilla planifolia or Vanilla tahitensia. For every 100 ml of extract, it must contain an amount of soluble substances proportional to their natural state available for extract. Specifically, if the beans contain < 25% water content, the <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> must consist of at least 10 g of vanilla beans; if the beans contain > 25% water content, the <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> must consist of at least 7.5 g of <b>vanilla</b> beans. <b>Vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> should not contain added colour.|$|R
40|$|The {{curing process}} of vanilla beans from dried <b>vanilla</b> to <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> would give added value to vanilla products. Aroma and taste in <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> depend on variety of plants, {{cultivation}} methods, and curing process. Indonesian <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> tend to give woody and phenolic aroma {{because it was}} harvested too early {{and it did not}} cure perfectly. This study was to identify the physicochemical and aroma characteristics of <b>vanilla</b> <b>extracts</b> from importer, exporter, and <b>vanilla</b> <b>extracts</b> from the newest experiment from our laboratory. There were seven samples, three from importers (Tahiti grade I, Tahiti grade II, Virginia Dare), two from Indonesian Vanilla exporters (Djasula Wangi, Cobra), and two from our laboratory (G 11, 57). The physicochemical characteristics which were analyzed were vanillin content, ash, soluble ash, alkalinity of soluble ash, alkalinity of total ash, total acidity, and lead number, all compared with the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) standard. Sensory analysis used aroma description test consist of qualitative descriptive test (in-depth interview and focus group methods) and quantitative descriptive analysis. The result showed that the laboratory's sample from modified curing process (G 11) followed the FDA standard in physicochemical characters, but the aroma description was not as strong as the aroma of <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> from exporters, namely Cobra with creamy, sweet, and vanilla aroma; and <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> from importer, namely Virginia with smoky and spicy arom...|$|R
5000|$|Ice {{cream is}} flavored by {{artificial}} or natural vanilla flavoring. Artificial flavorings contain 100% vanillin, {{the main ingredient}} that contributes to natural <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract's</b> flavor. Natural <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> also contains nearly 200 more compounds in addition to vanillin. The different chemical properties of these compounds may cause compatibility issues with different ice cream preparations. Vanilla ice cream may be classified {{by the type of}} flavoring used. If natural <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> is used, then the product is called [...] "vanilla ice-cream". If vanillin from natural vanilla is used, then the product is called [...] "vanilla flavored ice cream". If artificial vanillin is used, then the product is labelled as an [...] "artificially flavored vanilla ice-cream". [...] The United States Food and Drug Administration characterizes vanilla ice cream into three categories. Category I ice cream only contains <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract.</b> Category II ice cream contains 1 oz of synthetic vanilla per gallon (3.8 l) of 1-fold <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract.</b> Category III only contains synthetic ingredients.|$|R

40|$|Vanilla is an {{important}} flavor for many foods. Vanilla beans {{have been shown to}} contain over 200 compounds, which can vary in concentration depending on the region where the beans are harvested. Several compounds including vanillin, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, guaiacol, and anise alcohol {{have been found to be}} important for the aroma profile of vanilla. Because of the complexity of the vanilla aroma profile there are many gaps in the current understanding of how vanilla compounds are volatilized in food systems. Several novel analytical technologies are under investigation for their ability to aid in analyzing compounds in <b>vanilla</b> <b>extracts</b> and in model ice cream mixes. Although several methods are currently available, a need exists for a more rapid and sensitive method to analyze the concentration of important compounds in <b>vanilla</b> beans and <b>extracts.</b> Selected ion flow tube mass spectroscopy (SIFT-MS) and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy are two methods that have potential for rapid discrimination and characterization of <b>vanilla</b> <b>extracts.</b> <b>Vanilla</b> <b>extracts</b> made with bean...|$|R

40|$|Vanilla planifolia Andrews is a {{perennial}} tropical vine {{and is an}} orchid grown for its pleasant flavor. There is an increasing trend world over for using natural flavors. Vanilla being an important food flavoring ingredient, the demand for natural <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> is increasing. Hence, {{the aim of the}} present study was to prepare <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> from green beans without going through the elaborate and time-consuming conventional curing process. Vanilla beans after size reduction were mixed in a suitable proportion with tea leaf enzyme extract (TLEE) and incubated to facilitate action of enzymes on vanilla flavor precursors. The beans mix was squeezed, and the filtrate was treated with ethanol to <b>extract</b> the <b>vanilla</b> flavor. TLEE-treated <b>extracts</b> had higher vanillin content (4. 2 %) compared to Viscozyme extract (2. 4 %). Also, it had higher intensity of vanilla flavor, sweet, and floral notes. Further, electronic nose analysis confirmed the discrimination between extracts. It was concluded that the use of TLEE is very much useful to obtain higher yield of <b>vanilla</b> <b>extract</b> and superior quality vanilla flavor, which avoids the traditional laborious and time-consuming curing process...|$|R
