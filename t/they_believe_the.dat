5|$|Doggett, {{acting on}} Reyes' insistence that Ed is in danger, stakes out his house. Ed, however, is skinned {{regardless}} of Doggett's attempts to protect him. Reyes admits to Doggett {{that she is}} having flashes of the same premonitions that the victims are experiencing. She tells Doggett that Ed's body was gagged with a rag coated in coal dust from a mine, even though she has never seen his body. Reyes and Doggett head to the mine from which <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> dust originated. Doggett finds the skeleton of a sheriff who killed himself in 1909.|$|E
5|$|Later, Millennium Group {{offender}} profilers Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) {{investigate the}} disappearance of a bus full of schoolchildren. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> driver was also a victim, and not responsible; they meet with the local sheriff, John Cayce (Steven Rankin), who has dredged the bus from a lake. It is empty, but inside, Black experiences the same vision as Prine. He also finds paint transfer on the exterior, indicating the perpetrator was driving a white van. A false positive results as police apprehend storm chasers in a different van, who warn that a violent tornado is approaching.|$|E
5|$|Visiting {{the base}} that night, the agents witness a mysterious {{aircraft}} performing seemingly impossible maneuvers {{in the night}} sky. They flee when a black helicopter approaches, seemingly in pursuit of Emil and Zoe, a trespassing teenage couple. As Mulder treats Emil and Zoe to a meal at the diner, they tell the agents about the lights and how <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> UFOs are launched from another nearby base. Meanwhile, Budahas is returned to his home with no memory of what happened. After leaving the diner, Mulder and Scully are confronted by black-suited agents, who destroy the photographs they have taken and order them to leave town.|$|E

5|$|Puritans {{believed}} that God is sovereign {{over all of}} history and nature and that none of what were called his decrees would be frustrated. There was significant debate in the Assembly over the relationship of God's decree of predestination, or choice to save some people, to the redemption purchased by Christ's death. Many of the Reformed during this period taught that Christ died with the purpose only to save those who were eternally chosen to be saved, a doctrine called particular redemption. A vocal minority of the divines of the Assembly argued for a position known as hypothetical universalism. Edmund Calamy held such a view, and he argued that Christ's death, as well as saving {{those who had been}} chosen, offered salvation to all people on condition that <b>they</b> <b>believe.</b> <b>The</b> Assembly's Confession did not teach such a view, and its language is much more amenable to a particular redemption interpretation, but there is a general agreement among scholars that the Confession's language allows an hypothetical universalist interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} are {{at about}} twice {{the risk of being}} involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus {{in many areas of the}} world are not allowed to drive or only able to drive if certain conditions are met. In some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves. Countries that require physician reporting include Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Spain. Countries that require the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand and the physician may report if <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> individual has not already. In Canada, the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state. If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable. The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country. Many countries require one to three years without seizures. In the United States the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year.|$|E

25|$|According to copyright, music, and {{pop culture}} {{scholars}} Kembrew Mcleod and Peter DiCola, {{the golden age}} of hip-hop sampling spans from 1987-1992. Artists and record labels were not yet aware of the permanence of hip-hop culture in mainstream media, and did not yet accept it as a legitimate institution. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> ruling made in Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v.

25|$|Scholars {{debate whether}} hair-straightening {{practices}} arose out of Black desires {{to conform to}} a Eurocentric standard of beauty, {{or as part of}} their individual experiments with fashions and changing styles. Some believe that slaves and later African-Americans absorbed prejudices of the European slaveholders and colonizers, who considered most slaves as second-class, as they were not citizens. Ayana Byrd and Lori Tharp say that <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> preference for Eurocentric ideas of beauty still pervades the Western world.|$|E
25|$|On {{account of}} the {{magnitude}} of the Holocaust, many theologians have re-examined the classical theological views on God's goodness and actions in the world. Some believers and former believers question whether people can still have any faith in God after the Holocaust, and some of the theological responses to these questions are explored in Holocaust theology. Orthodox Jews have stated their reasons for why <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> Holocaust happened and, to a more extreme degree, why they felt the Jews of Europe deserved to die.|$|E

50|$|The judge erred in {{the short}} {{recharge}} in that he characterized the core issue {{to be determined by}} the jury as to whether <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> complainant or whether <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> appellant. The counsel for the appellant objected to the recharge, but the trial judge's response was that he did not feel that he left the jury with the impression that they must accept the appellant's evidence in order to acquit him. Thus, the appeal to the Court of Appeal was initially dismissed.|$|R
25|$|<b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> Book of Revelation {{provides}} {{insight into}} the early Eucharist, {{saying that it is}} the new Temple worship in the New Heaven and Earth. The idea of the Eucharist as a foretaste of the heavenly banquet is also explored by British Methodist Geoffrey Wainwright in his book Eucharist and Eschatology (Oxford University Press, 1980). According to Pope Benedict XVI some of the images of Revelation should be understood {{in the context of the}} dramatic suffering and persecution of the churches of Asia in the 1st century.|$|E
