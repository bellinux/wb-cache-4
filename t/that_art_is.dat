5|$|The Doctor learns Scaroth {{threatens to}} destroy Paris if Romana does not {{continue}} the work. He tries {{to gain the}} Countess' help by showing the Count's true form, but he kills her. Romana completes the adjustments, and Scaroth uses it {{to travel to the}} past. The Doctor quickly ushers Romana and Duggan to the TARDIS, fearing that the ship's explosion was the spark that started the development of life on Earth, and if Scaroth should prevent it, humanity would not come about. They arrive it time for Duggan to knock Scaroth out before he can reach the ship. Scaroth's body returns to the present, and when his alien form is discovered by his bodyguard, they get into a fight that damages the equipment and sets the mansion on fire, killing them both. By the time the Doctor, Romana and Duggan arrive, the original Mona Lisa and 5 of the 6 copies have been burnt, but the last copy remains safe. Duggan argues that they've lost an invaluable piece of art, but the Doctor assures him that the copy, still done by da Vinci's hand, will go unnoticed, and <b>that</b> <b>art</b> <b>is</b> worthless if its monetary value is all that matters. The Doctor and Romana say goodbye to Duggan at the Eiffel Tower.|$|E

25|$|Supporters of {{this new}} theory contest the {{prevailing}} assumption that the earliest art was painted or engraved on external surfaces such as cave walls or rock faces.

500|$|In 2008, Cineaste asked a {{range of}} {{academics}} for their definition of a cult film. [...] Several people defined cult films primarily {{in terms of their}} opposition to mainstream films and conformism, explicitly requiring a transgressive element, though others disputed the transgressive potential, given the demographic appeal to conventional moviegoers and mainstreaming of cult films. [...] Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock instead called them mainstream films with transgressive elements. [...] Most definitions also required a strong community aspect, such as obsessed fans or ritualistic behavior. [...] Citing misuse of the term, Mikel J. Koven took a self-described hard-line stance that rejected definitions that use any other criteria. [...] Matt Hills instead stressed the need for an open-ended definition rooted in structuration, where the film and the audience reaction are interrelated and neither is prioritized. Ernest Mathijs focused on the accidental nature of cult followings, arguing that cult film fans consider themselves too savvy to be marketed to, while Jonathan Rosenbaum rejected the continued existence of cult films and called the term a marketing buzzword. [...] Mathijs suggests that cult films help to understand ambiguity and incompleteness in life given the difficulty in even defining the term. [...] That cult films can have opposing qualities – such as good and bad, failure and success, innovative and retro – helps to illustrate <b>that</b> <b>art</b> <b>is</b> subjective and never self-evident. [...] This ambiguity leads critics of postmodernism to accuse cult films of being beyond criticism, as the emphasis is now on personal interpretation rather than critical analysis or metanarratives. [...] These inherent dichotomies can lead audiences to be split between ironic and earnest fans.|$|E

Hedrick thought Garcia bright and hip, and advised Garcia to attend poetry {{readings}} at the North Beach coffee houses, such as the Co-Existence Bagel Shop, the social centre of the Beat community. It was Hedrick who turned the young Garcia on to acoustic blues and Jack Kerouac’s On the Road and all its attendant attitudes.

2500|$|Duchamp once {{proposed}} <b>that</b> <b>art</b> <b>is</b> {{any activity}} of any kind- everything. However, {{the way that}} only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction. There is evidence {{that there may be}} an element of truth to this. [...] is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i.e. Fine Art. Shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity i.e. Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art but techne. Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and craft are historical products that came later on in human history. Techne included painting, sculpting and music but also; cooking, medicine, horsemanship, geometry, carpentry, prophecy, and farming etc.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his more formal teaching classes, Ruskin became an increasingly popular public lecturer in the 1850s. His first were in Edinburgh, in November 1853, on architecture and painting. Lectures at the Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester in 1857, were collected as The Political Economy of Art and later under Keats's phrase, A Joy For Ever. He spoke about how to acquire, {{and how to use}} art, arguing that England had forgotten that true wealth is virtue, and <b>that</b> <b>art</b> <b>is</b> an index of a nation's well-being. Individuals have a responsibility to consume wisely, stimulating beneficent demand. The increasingly critical tone and political nature of Ruskin's intervention outraged his father and the [...] "Manchester School" [...] of economists, as represented by a hostile review in the Manchester Examiner and Times. As the Ruskin scholar, Helen Gill Viljoen, notes Ruskin was increasingly critical of his father, especially in letters written by Ruskin directly to him, many of them still unpublished.|$|E
2500|$|The Phaedrus {{also gives}} us {{much in the}} way of {{explaining}} how art should be practiced. The discussion of rhetoric, the proper practice of which is found to actually be philosophy, has many similarities with Socrates's role as a [...] "midwife of the soul" [...] in the Theaetetus; the dialectician, as described, is particularly resonant. To practice the art, one must have a grasp of the truth and a detailed understanding of the soul in order to properly persuade. Moreover, one must have an idea of what is good or bad for the soul and, as a result, know what the soul should be persuaded towards. To have mastered the tools of an art is not to have mastered the art itself, but only its preliminaries. This is much like the person who claims to have mastered harmony after learning the highest and lowest notes of the lyre. To practice an art, one must know what <b>that</b> <b>art</b> <b>is</b> for and what it can help one achieve.|$|E
2500|$|In Handbook of Inaesthetics Badiou both {{draws on}} the {{original}} Greek meaning and the later Kantian concept of [...] "aesthesis" [...] as [...] "material perception" [...] and coins the phrase [...] "inaesthetic" [...] {{to refer to a}} concept of artistic creation that denies [...] "the reflection/object relation" [...] yet, at the same time, in reaction against the idea of mimesis, or poetic reflection of [...] "nature", he affirms <b>that</b> <b>art</b> <b>is</b> [...] "immanent" [...] and [...] "singular". Art is immanent in the sense that its truth is given in its immediacy in a given work of art, and singular in that its truth is found in art and art alone—hence reviving the ancient materialist concept of [...] "aesthesis". His view of the link between philosophy and art is tied into the motif of pedagogy, which he claims functions so as to [...] "arrange the forms of knowledge in a way that some truth may come to pierce a hole in them". He develops these ideas with examples from the prose of Samuel Beckett and the poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé and Fernando Pessoa (who he argues has developed a body of work that philosophy is currently incapable of incorporating), among others.|$|E

2500|$|Conceptual art {{became an}} {{important}} development in contemporary art in the late 1960s, it delivered an influential critique on the status quo. Late modernism expanded and contracted during the late 1960s and for some, conceptual art made a complete break with modernism. Sometimes it is labelled as postmodern because it is expressly involved in deconstruction of what makes a work of art, [...] "art". conceptual art, because it is often designed to confront, offend or attack notions held {{by many of the}} people who view it, is regarded with particular controversy. Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art. Thus, because Fountain was exhibited, it was a sculpture. Marcel Duchamp famously gave up [...] "art" [...] in favor of chess. Avant-garde composer David Tudor created a piece, Reunion (1968), written jointly with Lowell Cross that features a chess game, where each move triggers a lighting effect or projection. At the premiere, the game was played between John Cage and Marcel Duchamp. Some other famous examples being John Cage's 4' 33" [...] which is four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence and Rauschenberg's Erased De Kooning Drawing.
