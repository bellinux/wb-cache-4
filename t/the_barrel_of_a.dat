25|$|A {{suppressor}} or silencer is {{a device}} either attached to {{or part of}} <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> firearm {{to reduce the amount}} of noise and flash generated by firing the weapon. It generally takes the form of a cylindrically shaped metal tube with various internal mechanisms to reduce the sound of firing by slowing the escaping propellant gas, and sometimes by reducing the velocity of the bullet. Hiram Percy Maxim, the son of famous machine gun inventor Hiram Stevens Maxim, is credited with inventing the suppressor in 1909.|$|E
25|$|The {{inefficiency}} {{was caused}} by the speed with which the uncompressed fissioning uranium expanded and became sub-critical by virtue of decreased density. Despite its inefficiency, this design, because of its shape, was adapted for use in small-diameter, cylindrical artillery shells (a gun-type warhead fired from <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> much larger gun). Such warheads were deployed by the United States until 1992, accounting for a significant fraction of the U-235 in the arsenal, and were some of the first weapons dismantled to comply with treaties limiting warhead numbers. The rationale for this decision was undoubtedly a combination of the lower yield and grave safety issues associated with the gun-type design.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the peace}} process {{launched}} in 2003, sexual assault by soldiers from armed groups and the national army continues in the eastern provinces of the country. Evidence of war rape emerged when United Nations troops move into areas previously ravaged by war after {{the peace process}} started. Gang rape and rape with objects has been reported. The victims of war rape may suffer from incontinence and vaginal fistula {{as a result of}} particularly violent rape. Witness accounts include an instance of a woman who had <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gun inserted into her vagina, after which the soldier opened fire. Incontinence and vaginal fistula leads to the isolation of war rape victims from her community and access to reconstructive surgery is limited in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E
25|$|Pacino {{was injured}} during rehearsals for a gunfight after he grabbed <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prop gun which {{had just been}} used to fire several dummy bullets. His hand stuck to the hot barrel and {{he was unable to}} remove it immediately; the injury sidelined him for two weeks. The gunfight scene also {{includes}} a single camera shot directed by Steven Spielberg, who was visiting the set at the time. During filming, some Cuban-Americans objected to the film's Cuban-American characters being portrayed as criminals by non-Cuban-American actors. To counter this, the film features a disclaimer during its credits stating that the film characters were not representative of the Cuban-American community. The entertainment industry initially hated the film, with actress Liza Minnelli asking Pacino what he had done to leave the insiders subdued at a post-screening meal. (Minnelli had not seen the film at the time.) However, during the meal, actor Eddie Murphy told Pacino that he loved the film.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} into the illegal agents' payments was concluded in the summer, and the club was handed a ten-point deduction for the 2008–09 season on 3 June 2008, along with a £50,000 fine. The club's recent history of administrations meant that the Football League only offered to return the Football League Share to Luton {{on the condition that}} they play with a further twenty-point deduction. Staring down <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gun, Luton were forced to start the season with a 30-point penalty, the biggest points deduction ever handed to a club in the top four tiers of English football. Luton beat Scunthorpe United 3–2 in the Football League Trophy final in front of 40,000 of their own supporters at Wembley Stadium, but lost their League status eight days later. On 13 April 2009, Luton Town were finally relegated from the Football League after a spell of 89 years, as Chesterfield held Luton to a draw. Coupled with a victory for Mike Newell's Grimsby Town, this meant Luton's survival in the league became mathematically impossible to achieve.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the First Liberian Civil War, 80,000 {{refugees}} fled neighboring Liberia for the Sierra Leone – Liberian border. This displaced population, composed almost entirely of children, would prove to be an invaluable asset to the invading rebel armies because the refugee and detention centers, populated first by displaced Liberians and later by Sierra Leoneans, helped provide the manpower for the RUF’s insurgency. The RUF took advantage of the refugees, who were abandoned, starving, and in dire need of medical attention, by promising food, shelter, medical care, and looting and mining profits in return for their support. When this method of recruitment failed, as it often did for the RUF, youths were often coerced at <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gun to join the ranks of the RUF. After being forced to join, many child soldiers learned that the complete lack of law – as {{a result of}} the civil war – provided a unique opportunity for self-empowerment through violence and thus continued to support the rebel cause.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} wave of raids across Northern Ireland, 342 people were arrested. Many of those arrested {{reported}} that they and their families were assaulted, verbally abused and threatened by the soldiers. There were claims of soldiers smashing their way into houses without warning and firing baton rounds through doors and windows. Many of those arrested also reported being ill-treated during their three-day detention at the holding centres. They complained of being beaten, verbally abused, threatened, harassed by dogs, denied sleep, and starved. Some reported being forced to run a gauntlet of baton-wielding soldiers, being forced to run an 'obstacle course', having their heads forcefully shaved, being kept naked, being burnt with cigarettes, having a sack placed over their heads for long periods, having a rope kept around their necks, having <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gun pressed against their heads, being dragged by the hair, being trailed behind armoured vehicles while barefoot, and being tied to armoured trucks as a human shield. Some were hooded, beaten and then thrown from a helicopter. They were told they were hundreds of feet in the air, but were actually only {{a few feet from the}} ground.|$|E

500|$|All of the Eon Bond films {{feature the}} unique gun barrel sequence, created by graphic artist Maurice Binder, {{which has been}} called by British media {{historian}} James Chapman [...] "the trademark motif of the series". As Bond walks across the screen, he is viewed by the audience through <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gun trained on him by an unknown assailant. Bond wheels around and shoots directly at the gun/viewer, followed by the assassin's blood spilling down the barrel/screen. It was originally filmed in sepia by putting a pinhole camera inside an actual [...]38 calibre gun barrel, with stunt man Bob Simmons playing the part of Bond. The remake of the sequence for the wide-screen Thunderball featured Connery as Bond. This is accompanied by the opening bars of the [...] "James Bond Theme", composed by Monty Norman, orchestrated by trumpeter and composer John Barry and Burt Rhodes.|$|E

2500|$|Following his {{expulsion}} from Hogwarts, the Ministry of Magic broke Hagrid’s oak wand and forbade him to perform magic. Hagrid keeps {{the pieces of}} his wand in a pink umbrella, and performs small spells from time to time; however, he was technically forbidden to do magic until the third book, and since {{he is not a}} fully qualified wizard, he [...] "will always be a bit inept" [...] as compared to other adult wizards, but [...] "occasionally surprises everyone, himself included, by bringing off more impressive bits of magic". However, he is unable to produce a Patronus. He also has magical abilities that stem from his giant blood. For example, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, many of the stunning spells thrown at him by Ministry officials simply bounce off him. Also, being half-giant gives Hagrid some level of superhuman strength, which allowed him to bend <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shotgun with one hand.|$|E
2500|$|Minimum {{distance}} – When being tagged, {{depending on}} the distance from where the shot was fired, a direct paintball impact commonly causes bruises. In certain areas and at close range, these impacts may leave welts, or even break the skin and cause bleeding. To decrease these risks and the severity of associated injuries, commercial venues may enforce a minimum distance rule; such as , whereby players cannot shoot an opponent if they are closer than this distance. Many fields enforce a modified minimum distance surrender rule; a player who advances to within minimum range must offer his opponent the chance to surrender before shooting. This generally prevents injury and discord at recreational games, however it is seldom used in tournaments as it confers a real disadvantage to the attacking player; he must hesitate while his opponent is free to shoot immediately. The act of shooting a player at close range is colloquially called [...] "bunkering"; it happens most often when a player uses covering fire to force his opponent behind {{the cover of a}} bunker, then advances on that bunker while still shooting to eliminate the opponent point-blank. A tap of the targeted player with <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> marker, sometimes called a [...] "barrel tag", [...] "Murphy" [...] or [...] "tap-out", is generally considered equivalent to marking them with a paintball and is sometimes used in situations where one player is able to sneak up on an opponent to point-blank range.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to avoid {{destroying}} normal ideas of cause and effect, some theoreticians suggested that information about whether there was or was not a second beam-splitter installed could somehow be transmitted from the end point of the experimental device back to the photon as it was just entering that experimental device, thus permitting it to make the proper [...] "decision." [...] So Wheeler proposed a cosmic version of his experiment. In that thought experiment he asks {{what would happen if}} a quasar or other galaxy millions or billions of light years away from Earth passes its light around an intervening galaxy or cluster of galaxies that would act as a gravitational lens. A photon heading exactly towards Earth would encounter the distortion of space {{in the vicinity of the}} intervening massive galaxy. At that point it would have to [...] "decide" [...] whether to go by one way around the lensing galaxy, traveling as a particle, or go both ways around by traveling as a wave. When the photon arrived at an astronomical observatory at Earth, what would happen? Due to the gravitational lensing, telescopes in the observatory see two images of the same quasar, one to the left of the lensing galaxy and one to the right of it. If the photon has traveled as a particle and comes into <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> telescope aimed at the left quasar image it must have decided to travel as a particle all those millions of years, or so say some experimenters. That telescope is pointing the wrong way to pick up anything from the other quasar image. If the photon traveled as a particle and went the other way around, then it will only be picked up by the telescope pointing at the right [...] "quasar." [...] So millions of years ago the photon decided to travel in its guise of particle and randomly chose the other path. But the experimenters now decide to try something else. They direct the output of the two telescopes into a beam-splitter, as diagrammed, and discover that one output is very bright (indicating positive interference) and that the other output is essentially zero, indicating that the incoming wavefunction pairs have self-cancelled.|$|E
