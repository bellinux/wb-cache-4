5|$|Since 1916, the 18 {{counties}} {{where the}} O lands are located have received payments from the United States government as {{compensation for the}} loss of timber and tax revenue, beginning as a 50% share of timber revenue on those lands but changing over the years as <b>timber</b> <b>production</b> decreased.

5|$|Boise National Forest's 2010 forest plan {{recognizes that}} fire and other {{disturbances}} play {{important roles in}} maintaining the character and function of ecosystems. However, previous management strategies (as recently as the 1990 forest plan) treated fire as an undesirable process, and the Organic Act of 1897 explicitly stated that forests were {{to be protected from}} destruction by fire. In historic conditions fires naturally occurred on the landscape; the suppression of fires allowed dead trees to accumulate in excess of historic levels and land cover types to change, such as a shift to higher shrub and tree densities. An estimated 14 percent of the land in Boise National Forest has been affected by fires since the early 1990s, and about 10 percent of the land capable of <b>timber</b> <b>production</b> was burned so severely that land cover shifted from forest to grass and shrubland (as of 2010).|$|E
5|$|Several mills {{powered by}} Kettle Creek {{had been built}} by 1852. Logging, {{including}} cutting down hemlock trees, was historically done in the upper Kettle Creek watershed. The main companies doing logging {{in the area in}}cluded the Lackawanna Lumber Company, and Emporium and Goodyear Companies. The lumbering industry in the watershed began in the mid-1800s. With the arrival of railroads in the area in the late 1800s, the industry became more prevalent. The Lackawanna Lumber Company began working in the area in 1893. By 1900, there were two railroads along the creek used for hauling logs to a sawmill near Cross Fork. However, the lumbering industry collapsed after 1910. The population had peaked around 1900 and numerous residents of the watershed left shortly {{after the collapse of the}} area's lumbering industry. <b>Timber</b> <b>production</b> was done to a limited extent in the northern part of the watershed, as of 2001. The population has remained relatively stable since the 1930s.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} silvicultural management {{effects on}} bamboo shoot yields of s as a vegetable and for biomass production by bamboo culms. Bamboo yields respond positively to silvicultural practices, {{both in terms}} of shoot number, yield and biomass production. Fine-tuning is necessary for optimal input-output relationships. Data collected on the physical and mechanical properties of culms from different silvicultural practices are important from a practical perspective. Managing clumps for sustainable shoot or <b>timber</b> <b>productions</b> does not appear to interfere dramatically with the intended use of culms. However, differences between species and treatments that affect the ages of culms at harvest are important considerations when choosing bamboo production practices...|$|R

25|$|In 1996, the Forest Law {{was enacted}} to provide direct {{financial}} incentives to landowners {{for the provision of}} environmental services.

30|$|Policy {{measures}} {{should be}} placed on restriction of VOCs to the atmosphere. Likewise, an interesting shift from using less environmentally harmful adhesive in joining wood components for furniture and interior joinery by wood welding technology without the use of adhesive has been also initiated. This could be explained by the polymerization and cross-linking of lignin and of carbohydrate-derived furfural (Gfeller et al. 2003). Many studies have been conducted on wood welding using high speed rotation welding (Pizzi et al. 2004; Belleville et al. 2016) and linear welding (Mansouri et al. 2010; Martins et al. 2013; Belleville et al. 2017). If this technique could be scaled up successfully, it would contribute to reduce the adhesive based emission and environmental hazard involved in the <b>timber</b> <b>productions</b> process.|$|R

Natural resources such as forest products, and onshore and offshore mineral resources, are exploited only by top Myanmar military leaders and foreign companies.

The Yadana Gas project which connected pipelines alongside the towns of Mon state made harassed danger to the native Mon land and Mon people.|$|E
25|$|Originally, the {{silvicultural}} system now called coppicing was practiced solely for small wood production. In German {{this is called}} Niederwald, which translates as low forest. Later on in Mediaeval times farmers encouraged pigs to feed from acorns and so some trees were allowed to grow bigger. This different {{silvicultural system}} is called in English coppice with standards. In German this is called Mittelwald (middle forest). As modern forestry (Hochwald in German, which translates as High forest) seeks to harvest timber mechanically, and pigs are generally no longer fed from acorns, both systems have declined. However, there are cultural and wildlife benefits from these 2 silvicultural systems so both can be found where <b>timber</b> <b>production</b> or some other main forestry purpose (such as a protection forest against an avalanche) is not the sole management objective of the woodland.|$|E

In 1300, Edward I {{confirmed}} Ranulf de Blondeville's charter of 1215–16, but in the mid-14th century, Edward of Woodstock, the Black Prince, introduced various restrictive measures, which led to a large number of complaints recorded in the Black Prince's Register of 1351. Agricultural exploitation of {{the eastern edge of the}} forest was hampered by outbreaks of Black Death at Over, Little Budworth and Vale Royal Abbey in 1349, 1361 and 1369.

500|$|By the mid-16th {{century the}} Little Moreton Hall estate {{was at its}} {{greatest}} extent, occupying an area of [...] and including three watermills, {{one of which was}} used to grind corn. The contours of the pool used to provide power for the cornmill are still visible, although the mill was demolished in the 19th century. The Moreton family had owned an iron bloomery in the east of the estate since the late 15th century, and the other two mills were used to drive its water-powered hammers. The dam of the artificial pool that provided water for the bloomery's mills, known as Smithy Pool, has survived, although the pool has not. The bloomery was closed in the early 18th century, and the pool and moat were subsequently used for breeding carp and tench. By the mid-18th century the estate's main sources of income came from agriculture, <b>timber</b> <b>production,</b> fish farming, and property rentals.|$|E
500|$|Extensive timber {{cutting in}} the Sandy River basin {{began in the}} mid-19thcentury in {{response}} to a demand for wood from the Portland metropolitan area. Logging intensified in the lower basin through the 20thcentury as sawmills became established in Sandy, Boring, Brightwood and other settlements in the region, and railroad spurs extended into the forests. In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt signed into law the Bull Run Trespass Act to forbid activities such as camping and livestock grazing in the Bull Run Reserve. Except for activity related to the waterworks, the protected area changed little until the 1950s, when the United States Forest Service began to advocate logging in the Reserve. After the U.S. Congress passed the Multiple Use – Sustained Yield Act of 1960 stressing <b>timber</b> <b>production</b> in the national forests, the Forest Service in the 1960s and 1970s built about [...] of forest roads in the watershed.
