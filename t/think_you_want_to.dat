500|$|The {{appearance}} was long in coming, and Goldblum and Stokes Mitchell {{were not the}} first actors cast in those roles, though {{they are the first}} to appear on screen. A scene had been written in 2009 for the second episode, [...] "Showmance", that featured Rachel's fathers, but it was subsequently cut from the script even though the actors had already been cast and reported for work. Shortly before the final nine episodes of the first season were to begin airing, co-creator Ryan Murphy, when asked at PaleyFest in March 2010 whether her fathers would be appearing, replied: [...] "Not this season. We've never met them; I think that's a great surprise. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hold that a little bit." [...] Between the second and third seasons, co-creator Ian Brennan said, [...] "It's tricky with parents", referenced the scene cut from [...] "Showmance", and noted, [...] "we've talked about it forever, about different sets of parents", but [...] "when you're in high school, your parents stop being the major influence in your life". He then added, [...] "I think soon we'll probably reveal more and more".|$|E

Finally, after {{a long list of}} failures, someone has done justice in {{bringing}} one of King's horror stories to the screen. Though definitely not the feel-good movie of the season, this is a must-see for anyone who loves the genre and doesn't demand 'torture porn' from horror." [...] Roger Ebert was negative, however, writing: [...] "If you have seen ads or trailers suggesting that horrible things pounce on people, and they make you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see this movie, you will be correct. It is a competently made Horrible Things Pouncing on People Movie. If you think Frank Darabont has equaled the Shawshank and Green Mile track record, you will be sadly mistaken." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1996, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, then Lucienne Robillard, stated on the {{suggested}} alterations to the oath: [...] "This {{is a difficult}} decision to make, because I realise that when you speak about changing the oath, people <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> change all the monarchy system. We don't want a discussion like that in Canada right now." [...] According to an Angus Reid Strategies survey for Citizenship and Immigration Canada, conducted in January 1996, 51% of respondents felt that a new oath of allegiance should remove any reference to the Queen, and 38% felt that allegiance should be pledged to both Canada and its sovereign. Only 5% favoured swearing allegiance only to the monarch; though, at the same time, only 5% of Canadians were aware the Queen was their head of state. Meanwhile, press reaction to the continued proposals for alternate oaths was muted. The Globe and Mail editorial of 12 December 1998 stated: [...] "The language is being drained dry, killed by a thousand smiley-faced cuts," [...] while the Ottawa Citizen was more critical on 11 December: [...] "The new citizenship oath... leaves us cold... It would strengthen the political argument for abolishing the monarchy {{on the death of}} Queen Elizabeth; and it would test monarchist support by seeing how many Canadians even notice or holler. We noticed. Consider this a holler." ...|$|E

6000|$|Presently after Miles {{laid his}} hand on his mother's shoulder, and said, [...] "Mother, here's a {{daughter}} who <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> turn us out because she is too slow and stupid for your home child." [...] And he drew Anne up blushing as if she were his freshly-won bride.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] She {{said the}} word clearly and truly. [...] "And I will think myself a proud and happy and honoured woman to be so, Jeff. Oh, I don't shrink from telling you the truth, you see. You mean too much to me for me to {{dissemble}} it. I've hidden it for eighteen years because I didn't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hear it, but I'll give myself the delight of saying it frankly now." ...|$|R

60|$|If {{you go on}} in {{that way}} about your part, I shall <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> play Mr. Gabblewig. Your rôle, though a small one on the stage, is a large one off it; and no man is more {{important}} to the Guild, both on and off.|$|E

6000|$|... "Have I served your {{purpose as}} a guide?" [...] he asked. [...] "Never mind thanking me. Yes or no will do. Very good. I {{have got a}} line of writing to give you next." [...] He mended his quill pen, and made an observation. [...] "Have you ever noticed that women have one {{pleasure}} which lasts {{to the end of}} their lives?" [...] he said. [...] "Young and old, they have the same inexhaustible enjoyment of society; and, young and old, they are all alike incapable of understanding a man, when he says he doesn't care to go to a party. Even your clever mother <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go to parties in Canada." [...] He tried his pen, and found it would do--and began his letter.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you, Hugh, {{better than}} you <b>think.</b> <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{get back to your}} work, and--and I should be happier.

6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{implicate}} any one, {{but you are}} hot-headed {{and difficult}} to deal with, and very irrational into the bargain. And, what is worse, I must say you are a little suspicious. In all this matter I have harassed myself greatly to oblige you, and in return I have got more kicks than halfpence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be unpleasant, Hetty," [...] said Ingleby. [...] "Anyway, {{you have}} only about an hour in which to get ready, because if we're not off by the next train it's quite likely that we shall not have the {{opportunity}} for going at all. Get what you want together, and meet us behind the booking office on the main line platform. Tom and I will take the back way to the station." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] Kit said, laughing, [...] "you're {{generally}} frank. I'd {{rather have}} liked <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> did <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see me off. Anyhow, I'm glad you have arrived." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be {{sure that}} Lady Hardy sees you again--... If <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> take risks about that--... One never knows in these cases. Probably there is a night train." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I look at {{the matter}} in a {{different}} light," [...] said his sister. [...] "Captain Horn {{has no right to}} take you off on such a dangerous adventure, and, more than that, he has no right to take you from me, and leave me alone in the world. He once made you the guardian of all that treasure, and now he considers you as my guardian. You did not desert the first trust, and I am sorry to <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> desert the other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're always {{wanting to}} get me out of the house," [...] he continued; [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get us ALL out, for you manage to keep Nanda from showing even more than you do me. Don't you think your {{children}} good ENOUGH, mummy dear? At any rate it's as plain as possible that if you don't keep us at home you must keep us in other places. One can't live anywhere for nothing--it's all bosh that a fellow saves by staying with people. I don't know how it is for a lady, but a man's practically let in--" ...|$|E
6000|$|It was an odd, fragmentary {{discussion}} that night. We were all with ideas {{in our minds}} at once fine and imperfect. We threw out suggestions that showed themselves at once far inadequate, {{and we tried to}} qualify them by minor self-contradictions. Britten, I think, got more said than any one. [...] "You all seem to <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> organise people, particular groups and classes of individuals," [...] he insisted. [...] "It isn't that. That's the standing error of politicians. You want to organise a culture. Civilisation isn't a matter of concrete groupings; it's a matter of prevailing ideas. The problem is how to make bold, clear ideas prevail. The question for Remington and us is just what groups of people will most help this culture forward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Colonel. And if {{you were}} in my position, I do not <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> mention any of them either," [...] added Jack, looking the master of the Hall {{squarely}} in the eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go when Saturday {{afternoon}} comes?" [...] she asked. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> perhaps, {{that your}} new friends may {{invite you to}} go and see them? I am so jealous of your new friends, Arnold." ...|$|R
60|$|DORA. No; <b>you</b> mustn't <b>think.</b> <b>You</b> will be <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> make {{us think}} next; {{that will be}} tiresome.|$|R
6000|$|The Venetian does not, {{like the}} Spaniard, place his house at your disposition, and, having {{extended}} this splendid invitation, consider {{the duties of}} hospitality fulfilled; he {{does not appear to}} <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make use of his house for social purposes, preferring himself the caffè, and finding home and comfort there, rather than under his own roof. [...] "What caffè do you frequent? Ah! so do I. We shall meet often there." [...] This is frequently your new acquaintance's promise of friendship. And one may even learn to like the social footing on which people meet at the caffè, {{as well as that of}} the parlor or drawing-room. I could not help thinking one evening at Padua, while we sat talking with some pleasant Paduans in one of the magnificent saloons of the Caffè Pedrocchi, that I should like to go there for society, if I could always find it there, much better than to private houses. There is far greater ease and freedom, more elegance and luxury, and not the slightest weight of obligation laid upon you for the gratification your friend's company has given you. One has not to be a debtor in the sum of a friend's outlay for house, servants, refreshments, and the like. Nowhere in Europe is the senseless and wasteful American custom of treating known; and nothing could be more especially foreign to the frugal instincts and habits of the Italians. So, when a party of friends at a caffè eat or drink, each one pays for what he takes, and pecuniarily, the enjoyment of the evening is uncostly or not, according as each prefers. Of course no one sits down in such a place without calling for something; but I have frequently seen people respond to this demand of custom by ordering a glass of water with anise, at the expense of two soldi. A cup of black coffee, for five soldi, secures a chair, a table, and as many journals as you like, for as long time as you like.|$|E
5000|$|The {{title of}} the album arose out of a vision Mould had, [...] "of when people leave or things end, of {{something}} shooting through the 'fabric of the sky' and disappearing. 'Sometimes you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> chase it,' he says, meditating on the people or elements you lose along the way in life. 'Sometimes you {{get right to the}} edge of it, and sow it back shut and stay on the other side. Does that make sense?' You decide to patch the sky and keep going, instead of shooting through yourself." ...|$|E
5000|$|Charles Krauthammer, Columnist and Political Commentator:“The {{real issue}} here is the {{fairness}} argument - that if you’re an old fashioned store, {{you have to have}} your customers and you pay the sales tax and online you don’t. Which, I mean, you’re already at a disadvantage if you’re an old fashioned store: you have to have, you have to cover rent, you have to cover insurance and all that. So I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have something that will level the playing field. You can do it one of two ways. You abolish all sales taxes for real stores and nobody pays. Or you get the Internet people to pay the sales tax as well. I think the second one {{is the only way to}} do it, obviously.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Tom Foley: (1989-1995): In 2004, Foley said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> bring {{bills to}} the floor that a {{majority}} of your party is opposed to routinely but sometimes when a great issue is at stake, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> need to do that." ...|$|R
