500|$|By 1949 the Irish Free State {{had evolved}} into the Republic of Ireland and left the British Commonwealth, but not all Irish opinion favoured {{the removal of the}} Pillar. That year the {{architectural}} historian John Harvey called it [...] "a grand work", and argued that without it, [...] "O'Connell Street would lose much of its vitality". Most of the pressure <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> he said, came from [...] "traffic maniacs who... fail to visualise the chaos which would result from creating a through current of traffic at this point". In a 1955 radio broadcast Thomas Bodkin, former director of the National Gallery of Ireland, praised not only the monument, but Nelson himself: [...] "He was a man of extraordinary gallantry. He lost his eye fighting bravely, and his arm in a similar fashion".|$|E

When two of Thompson's trading partners tried to make him take two barrels of rum to Kootanae House, Thompson [...] "placed the two kegs on a vicious horse and by noon the kegs were empty and in pieces, the horse rubbing his load against the rocks <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> … I told them what I had done, and that I would do the same to every keg of alcohol."

2500|$|The {{main goal}} of ACT is to {{increase}} psychological flexibility. [...] There are six core processes in ACT interventions: Acceptance, Cognitive Defusion, Self as Context, Being Present, Values, and Committed Action. [...] Acceptance is taught in order to teach people to embrace their emotions, {{rather than trying to}} get rid of them. [...] An example of acceptance would be when people feel angry and then choose to focus on the anger and accept that they are angry, rather than trying to unleash their anger <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> [...] Cognitive defusion teaches people to not take their thoughts as literal in order to decrease the believability of negative thoughts and increase flexibility to behave as they want. [...] An example of cognitive defusion would be when someone thinks “I am the worst,” and then defuses the thought by thinking of things in which he or she excels.|$|E
