5|$|The {{heart of}} a Whippet is large and slow beating, often being arrhythmic or even {{intermittent}} when the animal is at rest. This sometimes causes concern <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner,</b> or to the vet not experienced with the breed. Whippets will, however, demonstrate a regular heartbeat during exercise. In a health survey conducted by The Kennel Club cardiac problems were shown to be the second leading cause of mortality in Whippets.|$|E

5|$|An {{accomplice}} {{could be}} sued {{if he had}} provided help ope consilio – a physical act relating to the method of execution, rather than mere encouragement. It appears that Labeo {{was the first to}} require help or advice, and earlier sources suggest that both help and advice was required. Labeo's version was certainly entrenched by the early second century AD. An accomplice was treated as if he himself had committed the crime. Only one person needed to have handled the thing for all wrongdoers to be liable. Republican jurists were harder on accomplices than later jurists under the empire. Indeed, Ulpian considers the unwitting accomplice, who accidentally knocks out of the victim's hand some coins which are then stolen, an accomplice to the theft. Some commentators have gone as far to say that the veteres ("ancients") may not have even required a third party to remove the coins, {{as long as they were}} otherwise lost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis paired {{up to do}} slapstick comedy for {{the first}} time at the 500 Club on July 25, 1946.

One night a different act failed to show up and Lewis suggested <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> that he hire Martin to do comedy with him. The owner was skeptical, but the two went ahead and tried to devise an act on paper in their hotel room, which did not work. The next night, they went on stage and improvised for three hours, bringing the house down. The comedy duo of Martin and Lewis was popular in nightclubs and in film from 1946 to 1956.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{arrive at}} the port and talk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> of the dog Dr. Ian Detweiler (Andrew Robinson), a cryptozoologist. Detweiler says the dog is a Wanshang Dhole, a species thought to be extinct. The two agents soon receive news of the other attack and, after investigating, Mulder {{believes}} the Dhole has near-human intelligence. Mulder and Scully visit Berquist, who tells them that the breed {{they are looking for}} is extinct. Meanwhile, a dog catcher is chasing a stray through a warehouse when a man enters the building. He promptly transforms into the murderous dhole and attacks the catcher. Mulder and Scully soon {{arrive at the}} scene, followed by Berquist. She finds a paw print with five toes, one more than regular canines.|$|E

5|$|The Sunda slow loris {{is greatly}} {{threatened}} by the pet trade, and is sold as an exotic pet throughout southeast Asia. The slow lorises are the most commonly traded protected primates in southeast Asia. When sold as a pet it often will have its teeth pulled out to prevent injury <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner.</b> This may cause dental infections which have up to a 90% death rate. Once it has lost its teeth, reintroduction to the wild is impossible. Due to a very high mortality rate in captivity due to stress, improper nutrition and infection, the pet trade is inflated by replacements. With a greater purchasing power, the increasing human populations in the species' range could have an even more serious impact.|$|E

This act provides for uniform and equitable treatment of persons displaced by a federal programs from their homes, businesses, or farms, including assuring just compensation and assisting in relocation. For example, if {{the construction of a}} highway under a federal program requires the expropriation of homes, the expropriation must be made by either providing fair compensation for that property or providing assistance for, or reimbursement of, relocation expenses incurred by the affected person.
