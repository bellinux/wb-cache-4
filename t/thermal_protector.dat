40|$|Transient {{voltage surge}} {{suppressors}} (TVSSs) using MOV technology {{are widely used}} to protect power systems and components against the effects of transient overvoltages. However MOVs can fail explosively under certain conditions, and protection is needed. Thermal protectors provide protection against failure under sustained power-frequency overvoltages, and in the paper the requirements for and performance of a typical <b>thermal</b> <b>protector</b> are given. The role of a series fuse is discussed in detail, and alternative protection philosophies are compared, leading to recommendations for the fusing of TVSS systems. The {{development of a new}} range of fuses and their key performance characteristics are described. Finally the performance of MOVs and fuses with repetitive surges is compared and it is shown how these two components can complement each other in an integrated TVSS system. 1...|$|E
40|$|One way {{to reduce}} {{structural}} weight of RX- 100 rocket is by modifying the nozzle material and processing. Nozzle is the main target in weight reduction {{due to the fact}} that it contributes 30 % to the total weight of the structur. An alternative for this is by substitution of massive graphite, which is currently used as <b>thermal</b> <b>protector</b> in the nozzle, with thin layer of HVOF (High Velocity Oxy-Fuel) thermal spray layer. This paper presents the characterization of nozzle base material as well as the modification of bonding strength test, by designing additional jig to facilitate testing processes while maintaining level of test accuracy. The results showed that the material used for RX- 100 rocket nozzle is confirmed to be S 45 C steel.

40|$|Triallyl cyanurate (TAC) and triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC) are new {{electrolytic}} additives for the Li-ion battery. Both additives are structural isomers, and {{are found}} to be flame retardant. So TAC has a triallyl structure, and TAIC a triamine structure. Both molecules include unsaturated C–C bonds, which can be good building blocks for a protective film on cathode. Flame retardants that have double bonds are able to improve both the flame retardancy of the electrolyte and the thermal protection for the cathode. The unsaturated carbon materials form a good protective film, by which the exothermic oxygen evolution reaction at the cathode is suppressed very effectively. TAC is the better <b>thermal</b> <b>protector.</b> Addition of 3 wt. % TAC delays the exothermic reaction by 52 °C, i. e., from 275 to 327 °C. A 5 wt. % TAC solution suppresses 75. 1 % of exothermic energy from the oxygen evolution reaction...|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{electrical}} fuses {{or circuit}} breakers, thermal fuses only react to excessive temperature {{and not to}} excessive current (unless the excessive current is sufficient to cause the thermal fuse itself to heat up to the trigger temperature). For example, in a surge <b>protector</b> <b>thermal</b> fuses may be wired in series with the varistors; when the varistors conduct, the fuse heats up and disconnects the power, which eliminates the risk of fire which can occur when the varistors are overloaded.|$|R

40|$|Thixoforging {{is a type}} of {{semi-solid}} {{metal processing}} at high solid fraction (0. 7 <fs< 1), which involves the processing of alloys in the semi-solid state. Tooling has to be adapted to this particular process to benefit of shear thinning and thixotropic behaviour of such semisolid material. Tooling parameters, as the forming speed and tool temperature, have to be accurately controlled because of their influence on thermal exchanges between material flow and tool. These thermal exchanges influence the high-cracking tendency and the rheology of the semisolid material during forming which affect parts properties. This paper shows, thanks to extrusion tests, how thermal exchanges influence surface quality of thixoforged parts made in 7075 aluminium alloys at high solid fraction by modifying process parameters like forming speed, tool temperature and tool <b>thermal</b> <b>protector.</b> A direct application is the evaluation of surface quality of thixoforged thin wall parts made in 7075 aluminium alloys.

50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal <b>thermal</b> overload <b>protectors</b> are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external <b>thermal</b> overload <b>protectors</b> connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|R
