5|$|The basic garment for all Romans, {{regardless}} of gender or wealth, was the simple sleeved tunic. The length differed by wearer: a man's reached mid-calf, but a soldier's was somewhat shorter; a woman's {{fell to her}} feet, and a child's <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>knees.</b> The tunics of poor people and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural, dull shades, with the length determined {{by the type of}} work they did. Finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man who belonged to the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes (clavi) woven vertically into the fabric: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status. Other garments could be layered over the tunic.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} notable {{innovations}} during the Tang, including {{the development of}} woodblock printing. Buddhism became a major influence in Chinese culture, with native Chinese sects gaining prominence. However, Buddhism would later be persecuted by the state, subsequently declining in influence. Although the dynasty and central government were in decline by the 9th century, art and culture continued to flourish. The weakened central government largely withdrew from managing the economy, though the country's mercantile affairs stayed intact and commercial trade continued to thrive regardless, at least until agrarian rebellions {{in the latter half}} of the 9th century brought the dynasty <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>knees,</b> resulting in damaging atrocities such as the Guangzhou Massacre.|$|E
5|$|In 692/693, the Byzantine emperor Justinian II (reigned 685–695 and 705–711) and the Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) {{broke the}} truce that had existed between Byzantium and the Umayyad Caliphate since 679, {{following}} the failed Muslim {{attack on the}} Byzantine capital, Constantinople. The Byzantines secured great financial and territorial advantages from the truce, which they extended further by exploiting the Umayyad government's involvement in the Second Muslim Civil War (680–692). However, by 692 the Umayyads were clearly emerging as the victors in the conflict, and Abd al-Malik consciously {{began a series of}} provocations to bring about a resumption of warfare. Justinian, confident in his own strength based on his previous successes, responded in kind. Finally, the Umayyads claimed that the Byzantines had broken the treaty and invaded Byzantine territory, defeating the imperial army at the Battle of Sebastopolis in 693. In its aftermath, the Arabs quickly regained control over Armenia and resumed their attacks into the border zone of eastern Asia Minor, that would culminate in the second attempt to conquer Constantinople in 716–718. Furthermore, Justinian was deposed in 695, beginning a twenty-year period of internal instability that almost brought the Byzantine state <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|E

50|$|The 'Pagans of Scoughall' had {{the worst}} of reputations. They were said to tie a horse's neck <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>knee</b> and attach a lantern to the rope, then drive the horse slowly along the cliffs, so that a vessel out at sea would think it a ship riding at anchor, and come in, only to be wrecked on the rocky reef known as the Great Car and be plundered by the ghoulish people. These tales gave Stevenson the idea for his story 'The Wreckers'.

25|$|The {{series of}} raids {{launched}} by the Chola Empire in the 11th century had weakened the once glorious empire of Srivijaya. By {{the end of the}} 13th century, the already fragmented Srivijaya caught the attention of the expansionist Javanese King, Kertanegara of Singhasari. In 1275, he decreed the Pamalayu expedition to overrun Sumatra.

However, when the Chinese troops invaded, Hsinbyushin decided to call most of his troops back to resist the Chinese.|$|E

In particular, he retained the services of William of Shareshill, a talented lawyer, to maximise the abbey's income from its endowments.

25|$|The Cup Winners' Cup triumph {{proved to}} be the last of Chelsea's successes in the decade, as a series of {{problems}} combined to almost bring the club <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>knees.</b> From the early 1970s, the discipline of the team began to degenerate, as Sexton fell out with several key players, most notably Osgood, Hudson and Baldwin over their attitude and lifestyle. As the spirit of the team declined, so too did results. Chelsea set two records in defence of the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971–72: a 21–0 aggregate win over Luxembourg side Jeunesse Hautcharage, which remains a record scoreline in European competition. The result included a 13–0 home win over Jeunesse, the biggest winning scoreline in Chelsea's history. However, the team were knocked out of the competition by little-known Åtvidabergs FF under the away goals rule in the next round.|$|E

50|$|Another {{monster that}} Kirsāsp fought was the Gandarəβa, Middle Persian Gandarw. (This name is cognate to the Indic gandharva, but the exact {{way in which}} the word {{acquired}} its respective meanings in Indic and Iranian cultures is uncertain.) The Gandarw lived in the sea. It was also enormous, big enough to swallow twelve provinces in a single gulp, and so tall that when it stood up the deep sea reached only <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>knee</b> and <b>its</b> head was as high as the sun. The Gandarw pulled Kirsāsp into the ocean, and they fought for nine days. At last, Kirsāsp flayed the Gandarw and bound it with its own skin. Kirsāsp, weary from the combat, had his companion Axrūrag guard the Gandarw while he slept, but it proved too much for him - the Gandarw dragged Axrūrag and Kirsāsp's family into the sea. When Kirsāsp awakened, he rushed to the sea, freed the captives, and killed the Gandarw.|$|R
25|$|The {{decline in}} per capita income growth {{at the end of}} the 18th century may appear as a counterargument against the modernity of the Dutch economy. However, at closer {{inspection}} this was actually a modern process of restructuring in the face of adverse circumstances, as may be seen in current modern economies, like the United States and European countries, that also undergo major structural upheavals. The 18th-century deindustrialization was in large part a consequence of a too-high real wage level, combined with protectionist policies of foreign governments, closing access to major markets. The agricultural depression was a general European phenomenon. The crisis in foreign trade was answered, and partly parried, with commercial innovations. The financial and fiscal crisis that proved the Republic's undoing was altogether modern in nature (unlike the comparable crises that regularly brought the Spanish Crown <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>knees),</b> but simply happened before the modern means of dealing with it (expansion of the tax base and/or monetary inflation) were at hand.|$|E
25|$|Basically {{the same}} Coalition, again {{led by the}} Republic and what now became Great Britain, soon fought France again in the War of the Spanish Succession, in which the States Army reached its {{greatest}} power and size: 119,000 men in 1712. It therefore formed {{the backbone of the}} Anglo-Dutch forces in the Southern Netherlands, led by the Duke of Marlborough (while the Republic also paid for many of the troops supplied by the allied German princes and Denmark, by way of subsidies); the British contribution was usually smaller in size at most of the battles fought during this conflict. The effort required from the Republic in this war almost brought it to financial exhaustion, just as France was financially brought <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>knees.</b> This, {{and the fact that the}} fruits of the allied victory over France were almost exclusively reaped by Great Britain (that had turned its back on its allies and concluded a separate peace) so disillusioned the Dutch government, that they decided to turn their back on European power politics for the remainder of the 18th century, adopting a policy of armed neutrality.|$|E

500|$|For Hitler, the Soviet {{capital was}} secondary, and he {{believed}} {{the only way to}} bring the Soviet Union <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>knees</b> was to defeat it economically. [...] He felt this could be accomplished by seizing the economic resources of Ukraine east of Kiev. When Walther von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, supported a direct thrust to Moscow, he was told that [...] "only ossified brains could think of such an idea". Franz Halder, head of the Army General Staff, was also convinced that a drive to seize Moscow would be victorious after the German Army inflicted enough damage on the Soviet forces. This view was shared by most within the German high command. But Hitler overruled his generals in favor of pocketing the Soviet forces around Kiev in the south, followed by the seizure of Ukraine. The move was successful, resulting in the loss of 660,000 Red Army personnel by 26 September, and further advances by Axis forces.|$|E

40|$|We analyse a {{sequence}} of high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of a sunspot taken at the 1 -m SST, to determine the nature of flux emergence in a light bridge and the processes related <b>to</b> <b>its</b> evolution in the photosphere and chromosphere. Blueshifts of about 2 km/s are seen near the entrance of a granular light bridge on the limbward side of the spot. They lie next to a strongly redshifted patch that appeared 6 mins earlier. Both patches are seen for 25 mins {{until the end of}} the sequence. The blueshifts coincide with an elongated emerging granule, while the redshifts appear at the end of it. In the photosphere, the development of the blueshifts is accompanied by a simultaneous increase in field strength and inclination, with the field becoming nearly horizontal. In the redshifted patch, the magnetic field is equally horizontal but of opposite polarity. An intense brightening is seen in the Ca filtergrams over these features, 17 mins after they emerge in the photosphere. The brightening is due to emission in the blue wing of the Ca line, close <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>knee.</b> Non-LTE inversions reveal that the asymmetric emission is caused by a temperature enhancement of about 700 K between - 5. 0 <log tau<- 3. 0 and a blueshift of 3 km/s at log tau=- 2. 3. The photospheric blueshifts and redshifts seem to be caused by the emergence of a small-scale, flat Omega-loop with highly inclined footpoints of opposite polarity. The gas motions detected in the two footpoints are reminiscent of a siphon flow. The rising loop is probably confined to the lower atmosphere by the overlying sunspot magnetic field and the subsequent interaction may be responsible for temperature enhancements in the upper photosphere/lower chromosphere. This is the first time that magnetic flux is observed to emerge in the strongly magnetised environment of sunspots, pushed upward by the convective flows of a granular light bridge.

Wilson therefore put all his eggs in the sanctions basket, predicting in January 1966 that the embargo would bring Rhodesia <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>knees</b> [...] "within {{a matter of weeks}} rather than months". The UN embargo proved ineffective, largely because both Portugal and South Africa refused to participate.

[...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] deals with interrogation and torture. Walters realised that torture is counterproductive as the suspects can say anything the interrogators want to hear, but rationalises that Adam is an expert in that field. To get the interrogation as true as possible, the producers consulted with ex-Army advisors who were trained in questioning terror suspects. As the episode was first broadcast, a prison abuse scandal in Iraq was put on the news. In response to this, Kudos director Stephen Garrett stated [...] "Spooks is really well researched and sometimes we look like we're ahead of the game.
