5|$|While both {{hunting and}} fishing were common, <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> mostly hunted to protect their herds and crops.

5|$|Bishop Lépes and his brother, the vice-voivode, {{started to}} {{assemble}} their troops near the peasants' camp. The absent voivode, Ladislaus Csáki, hurried to Transylvania. The counts of the Székelys, Michael Jakcs and Henry Tamási, also joined the united armies of the voivode and the bishop. The young noblemen {{who joined the}} campaign {{wanted to make a}} sudden assault on <b>the</b> <b>peasants,</b> but the bishop suggested that <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> should be pacified through negotiations.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>peasants</b> elected four envoys {{to inform}} the voivode about their grievances. They {{requested}} Csáki {{to put an end}} to abuses over the collection of the tithe and to persuade the bishop to lift the ecclesiastic bans. They also demanded the confirmation of the serfs' right to free movement. Instead of entering into negotiations, the voivode had the rebels' envoys tortured and executed in late June. He soon invaded the rebels' camp, but <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> repulsed the attack and encircled his army.

5|$|Although the {{authorities}} {{had won a}} total military victory, they refrained from inflicting further draconian measures on the general population. The whole affair had clearly demonstrated that the cities depended on the support of their rural subjects. Putting down the insurrection had been achieved only with difficulties, and only {{with the help of}} troops from Zürich and Uri. Had <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> succeeded to extend the Huttwil League to encompass the countryside of Zürich, the outcome of the conflict might have been different. The city authorities were well aware of their essentially lucky escape, and their actions in the following years reflect it. While they took steps to disempower the rural population politically, they also fulfilled many of <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> original fiscal demands, alleviating the economic pressure on them. Tax reforms were passed, to the point that for instance in the canton of Lucerne the overall taxation of the population decreased {{in the second half of}} the 17th century.|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{several problems}} {{relating to the}} personality of <b>the</b> <b>peasant.</b> They include positive and negative stereotypes about <b>the</b> <b>peasant’s</b> personality, about <b>the</b> status and role of <b>the</b> <b>peasant,</b> and about concrete research work on this problem by social psychologists and rural sociologists. The positive stereotypes about <b>the</b> <b>peasant’s</b> personality are very numerous and they vary in nature and importance. They are economic and demographical, moral and sociological. Such stereotypes have sometimes influenced ideological views and positions based on the physiocratic and romantic ideas about the primacy of land cultivation, {{the purity of the}} work and the morals of <b>the</b> <b>peasant,</b> his creative potentialities in folk art, etc. However, industrial development has produced an increased number of negative stereotypes, which regard the peasantry as an outdated category, see a considerable degree of crudeness and backwardness in <b>the</b> <b>peasant’s</b> personality, and believe that it is »better for society if there are fewer peasants«. Investigations by social phychologists and rural sociologists of <b>the</b> <b>peasant’s</b> personality are still comparatively rare and they often tend to accept either the positive or the negative stereotypes and can thus hardly serve as a scientific basis either for theoretical generalization or for practice...|$|R
50|$|The tale {{begins with}} a peasant tilling his fields {{with a pair of}} oxen. Inexplicably, while in the field, the oxen's horns grew to an {{extraordinary}} size; an effect that prevented <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> from returning home with them. Fortunately, <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> was able to sell the oxen to a nearby butcher. The butcher, having no currency on him, bartered a measure of turnip-seed with <b>the</b> <b>peasant,</b> offering should <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> return to him with the measure of rapeseed he would exchange a Brabant thaler for each seed. <b>The</b> <b>peasant</b> returned home with the seed, however, he lost one seed out of the bag on the way. The next day, the butcher paid him per agreement minus the one missing seed. On his way back from <b>the</b> butcher, <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> passed where he dropped the seed and saw it had sprouted into a tree which reached up to <b>the</b> heavens. <b>The</b> <b>peasant</b> climbed <b>the</b> tree and, reaching the top, spied angels threshing oats. While he was viewing the angels, the tree began to shake; someone below was cutting down the tree. To save himself from being falling from <b>the</b> tree, <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> wove a length of rope from the oat chaff that lay in piles. Before descending he stole a hoe and a flail which were lying in the heavenly fields. He descended the rope only to find himself at the bottom of deep pit. Using the hoe, he carved a flight of steps and walked up and out of <b>the</b> pit. <b>The</b> <b>peasant</b> kept <b>the</b> flail as proof of his adventure.|$|R

50|$|Historically the Mosuo {{lived in}} a feudal system where a larger peasant {{population}} was controlled by a small nobility. The nobility was afraid of <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> class gaining power. Since leadership was hereditary, <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> class was given a matriarchal system. This prevented threats to nobility power by having <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> class trace lineage through the female line. This system has led to numerous unusual traits among Mosuo society.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe “one village, one product” program {{establishes}} {{an important}} pattern of agricultural economy specialization and formalization in China.

It is found that <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> households’ behavior evolved result would create the low efficiency of collective brand maintenance {{if they do not}} treasure personal reputation.

A second army led by Emmenegger laid siege to Lucerne. The city authorities were unprepared for an armed conflict and immediately engaged in negotiations. Within days, peace agreements were concluded. In the peace on the Murifeld (Murifeldfrieden, named after the field just outside Bern where the peasant army's camp lay) signed by Leuenberger and the mayor of Bern, Niklaus Dachselhofer, the city council of Bern promised on May 28, 1653, to fulfill the peasants' fiscal demands in return for the dissolution of the Huttwil League. In view of this development, the city of Lucerne and the besieging peasants agreed on a truce. Leuenberger's army lifted the siege of Bern and retreated, but the people refused to follow their leaders and objected to dissolving the Huttwil League.|$|E
5|$|On May 30, 1653, {{following}} an earlier {{resolution of the}} Tagsatzung and earlier Bernese demands, Zürich assembled an army with recruits from its own territories, from the Thurgau, and from Schaffhausen {{under the command of}} Conrad Werdmüller with the task to break any armed resistance once and for all times. Some 8,000 men with 800 horses and 18 cannons marched towards the Aargau. Already three days later, Werdmüller's army controlled the important crossing of the river Reuss at Mellingen. In the hills around the nearby villages Wohlenschwil and Othmarsingen a peasant army of some 24,000 men assembled, led by Leuenberger and Schybi. A peasant delegation tried to negotiate with Werdmüller, showing him the peace treaty concluded on the Murifeld. Werdmüller, who had been until then unaware of this treaty that had been signed only days before, refused to acknowledge the validity of the contract and demanded the unconditional surrender of <b>the</b> <b>peasants.</b> Thus rebutted, <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> attacked Werdmüller's troops on June 3, 1653, but being poorly equipped and lacking any artillery, they were defeated decisively in the Battle of Wohlenschwil. <b>The</b> <b>peasants</b> were forced to agree to the peace of Mellingen, which annulled the Huttwil League. The peasant troops returned home and an amnesty was declared, except for the leaders of the movement.|$|E

On April 23, 1653, representatives of the people of the countryside of Lucerne, Bern, Basel, and Solothurn met at Sumiswald and concluded an alliance to help each other to achieve their goals.
