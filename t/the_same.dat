In contrast, a group of antibodies can be called polyvalent (or unspecific) if they have affinity for various antigens or microorganisms. Intravenous immunoglobulin, if not otherwise noted, consists of polyvalent IgG. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies are monovalent for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> epitope.|$|E

5|$|All IQ {{tests show}} {{variation}} in scores even when <b>the</b> <b>same</b> person takes <b>the</b> <b>same</b> test {{over and over}} again.

The various test publishers do not use uniform names or definitions for IQ score classifications. All these issues must be kept in mind when interpreting an individual's IQ scores, because they all can result in different IQ classifications for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> person at different times.|$|E
