McCain's intervention helped to give dissatisfied House Republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement. After Obama declined McCain's suspension suggestion, McCain went ahead with the debate on September 26. On October 1, McCain voted in favor of a revised $700 billion rescue plan.

Subprime mortgages are risky or less than ideal loans or mortgages extended to borrowers with questionable credit worthiness.

40|$|One of {{the roots}} of the recent global {{financial}} crisis has been seen in <b>the</b> design of <b>subprime</b> mortgage contract leading to high sensitivity of such type of loans to house price changes. <b>The</b> market of <b>subprime</b> loans, especially in the last years preceding the crisis, has been highly financed by securitization. The paper investigates how borrowers with <b>subprime</b> characteristics influence <b>the</b> transmission mechanism of business cycles in the economy and whether <b>the</b> securitization of <b>subprime</b> loans has a positive effect on the economy. The formal setup is a DSGE model with different types of borrowers and banks acting as financial intermediaries, in which households and entrepreneurs borrow against housing collateral. The economy is subject to four shocks: monetary, inflationary, preference and technology. It is shown that alone <b>the</b> existence of <b>subprime</b> borrowers does not make the economy more responsive to different shocks at the aggregate level (it has only redistributional effects) and that under certain circumstances <b>the</b> securitization of <b>subprime</b> loans (in form of residential mortgage backed securities) may lead to amplification of the business cycles...|$|R

However, there is only unidirectional relationship from stock prices to exchange rates during insignificant financial crisis period. Such results imply that two financial crises do significantly affect the short-term interrelationships between the stock and FX markets and lead to more importance for the connection between two markets. ...|$|R
