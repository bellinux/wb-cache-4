2500|$|The {{original}} design of 1884 used a belt drive, and <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> {{on the handlebars}} which applied the brake when turned one way and tensioned the drive belt, applying power to the wheel, when turned the other way. Roper's velocipede of the late 1860s used a similar two way twistgrip handlebar control. The plans also called for steering linkage shafts that made two right angle bends connected with gears, but the actual working model used a simple handlebar without the <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> or gear linkage. [...] The design was patented on August 29, 1885.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{having only}} a single rotor, the RE5's engine was {{mechanically}} complex and its numerous subsystems made for a heavy motorcycle. Rotary engines produce a lot of heat, and the RE5 had [...] water- and oil-cooling, and double-skinned exhaust pipes. [...] Ignition was CDI, with two sets of ignition points actuated via vacuum and rpm sensors, to light a solitary NGK spark plug. Three oil reservoirs served the sump, gearbox and total loss tank. Separate oil pumps fed (respectively) the main bearings and the inlet tracts (to lubricate tip seals). The throttle controlled both the primary carburetor butterfly and a second valve in the inlet manifold of the secondary throat (the [...] "port" [...] valve), as well as governing oil supply to the combustion chamber. Five cables in total were moved by the throttle <b>twist</b> <b>grip!</b> The carburetor {{was similar to that}} in a rotary-powered car, and was far more complicated than for normal motorcycles.|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, Indian {{built its}} first V-twin factory racer, and in {{following}} years {{made a strong}} showing in racing and record-breaking. In 1907, the company introduced the first street version V-twin and a roadster styled after the factory racer. The roadster can be distinguished from the racers {{by the presence of}} <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> linkages. One of the firm's most famous riders was Erwin [...] "Cannonball" [...] Baker, who set many long-distance records. In 1914, he rode an Indian across America, from San Diego to New York, in a record 11 days, 12 hours and ten minutes. Baker's mount in subsequent years was the Powerplus, a side-valve V-twin, which was introduced in 1916. Its 61ci (1000 cc), 42 degree V-twin engine was more powerful and quieter than previous designs, giving a top speed of 60mph (96km/h). The Powerplus was highly successful, both as a roadster and as the basis for racing bikes. It remained in production with few changes until 1924.|$|E

50|$|The Powerplus had twist grips on both handles; the {{throttle}} {{was controlled by}} the left <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> while the right <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> advanced or retarded the spark. Three controls were {{on the right side}} of the gas tank, a vertically-operated shifter, an exhaust valve lifter, and a hand clutch lever. The clutch lever was linked to the clutch pedal positioned on the left side of the bike.|$|E
25|$|California {{inventor}} Jack McCornack {{took the}} Fledge IIB wing and designed a tubular assembly that replaced the Fledge's hang glider seat with a reclined pilot seat, wheeled landing gear and engine mount for a pusher powerplant. The aircraft used a mouth-controlled throttle, as both hands were {{used on the}} tip rudder <b>twist</b> <b>grips</b> which were retained from the Fledge. The aircraft had no canard or tail and was a true flying wing. Power was supplied by a two-stroke Xenoah engine of 16 horsepower driving a 36-inch propeller. This new design, named the Pterodactyl Fledgling, was first flown in 1977. It is also referred to variously as the Pterodactyl Fledge and Pfledge.|$|R

50|$|Leno weave (also called Gauze weave or Cross weave) is a weave {{in which}} two warp yarns are twisted around the weft yarns to provide a strong yet sheer fabric. The {{standard}} warp yarn is paired with a skeleton or 'doup' yarn; these <b>twisted</b> warp yarns <b>grip</b> tightly to the weft which causes the durability of the fabric. Leno weave produces an open fabric with almost no yarn slippage or misplacement of threads.|$|R
30|$|The {{unintended}} motion {{such as the}} grasping sometimes causes misdetection {{because the}} force sensors fixed in the handle grip are pressed {{at the same instant}} by the grasping motion. Our proposed handling interface prevents such misdetection due to the grasping motion, which causes a malfunction, because the solid grip cover blocks the gripping forces, as shown in Fig.  7 (3). The twisting motion also sometimes causes similar misdetection. However, when the user <b>twists</b> the handle <b>grip,</b> as shown in Fig.  7 (4), the DFSs do not come in contact (or only come in slight contact) with the solid grip cover because of our proposed mechanical structure. Therefore, when the user <b>twists</b> the handle <b>grip,</b> the downward force sensed by the DFSs becomes smaller than the set threshold value. On the other hand, the FFSs and BFSs are pressed at the same time; thus, the sensors sense the pushing or pulling force applied to the handle grip as shown in Fig.  7 (4). Although the forces are detected, we can prevent the erroneous motion of the robotic cart because the downward force is smaller than the set threshold value.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Purpose: The aim of {{this work}} was to analyse all the applied {{movements}} when extracting healthy upper and lower jaw premolars for orthodontic purposes. The authors wanted {{to demonstrate that the}} different bone densities of the mandible and maxilla are not a significant parameter when related to the extraction force applied. The buccal and palatal rocking movements, plus the twisting movements were also measured in this in-vivo study during premolar extraction for orthodontic purposes. Methods: The physical strains or forces transferred onto the teeth during extraction are the following three movements: <b>gripping,</b> <b>twisting,</b> and traction. A strain measurement gauge was attached onto an ordinary dentistry plier. The strain measurement gauge was constituted with an extensimetric washer with three 45 º grids. The system operation was corre-lated to the variation of electrical resistance. Results: The variations of resistance (∆R) and all the different forces applied to the teeth (∆V) were recorded by a com-puterized system. Data results were processed through Microsoft Excel. The results underlined the stress distribution on the extracted teeth during <b>gripping,</b> <b>twisting</b> and flexion. Conclusions: The obtained data showed that the strength required to effect teeth extraction is not influenced by the quality of the bone but is instead influenced by the shape of the tooth’s root...|$|R
50|$|The {{first use}} of the <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> {{throttle}} control was on the Roper steam velocipede of 1867-69. Rather than a sleeve that rotated around the handlebar, Sylvester H. Roper's steam motorcycle's entire handlebar rotated, with a dual mode operation. When rotated forward it opened the throttle, and when rotated backwards it applied the spoon brake. Motorcycle Consumer News design columnist Glynn Kerr said that pioneering this technology was a point {{in favor of the}} Roper's precedence as the first motorcycle, in response to Cycle World Technical Editor Kevin Cameron's position that the 1885 Daimler Reitwagen was more deserving because it used the more successful technology, internal combustion rather than steam. The design drawings of the Reitwagen depicted a <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> speed control, also applying the brake when turned one way, but when turned the other way, it would have tensioned the belt drive's idler pulley, applying power to the rear wheel {{in the manner of a}} clutch. The actual working model, however, did not have the <b>twist</b> <b>grip,</b> belt drive, or brakes.|$|E
50|$|Traditional scooters (such as the Vespa) {{still have}} manual {{gear-changing}} by a <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> {{on the left}} hand side of the handlebar, with a co-rotated clutch lever. Modern scooters were often fitted with a throttle-controlled continuously variable transmission, thus earning the term twist-and-go.|$|E
50|$|The Mobil {{originally}} had a 150 cc single-cylinder two-stroke engine mounted between the dashboard and the rider's seat.

50|$|Helicopter rotors are {{designed}} to operate at a specific rotational speed. The throttle controls {{the power of the}} engine, which is connected to the rotor by a transmission. The throttle setting must maintain enough engine power to keep the rotor speed within the limits where the rotor produces enough lift for flight. In many helicopters, the throttle control is a single or dual motorcycle-style <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> mounted on the collective control (rotation is opposite of a motorcycle throttle), while some multi-engine helicopters have power levers.|$|E
50|$|Helicopter rotors are {{designed}} to operate in a narrow range of RPM. The throttle controls the power produced by the engine, which {{is connected to the}} rotor by a fixed ratio transmission. The purpose of the throttle is to maintain enough engine power to keep the rotor RPM within allowable limits so that the rotor produces enough lift for flight. In single-engine helicopters, the throttle control is a motorcycle-style <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> mounted on the collective control, while dual-engine helicopters have a power lever for each engine.|$|E

The pilot {{needs to make}} only small adjustments by <b>twisting</b> the throttle <b>grip</b> on the collective throughout the flight regime. Later models are also equipped with an electronic governor which works to maintain RPM within normal operating limits (between 97% and 104% RPM); the governor is active only when the engine is running above 80% RPM, and is most effective in normal flight conditions. The governor can be switched on or off with a toggle switch located {{at the end of}} the pilot's collective pitch control.

50|$|Lineman's, {{linesman}}'s (US English), linesman pliers (Canadian English), combination pliers, or side-cutting pliers are {{a type of}} pliers used by electricians {{and other}} tradesmen primarily for <b>gripping,</b> <b>twisting,</b> bending and cutting wire and cable. Linemen's pliers owe their effectiveness to their plier design, which multiplies force through leverage. Lineman's pliers have a gripping joint at their snub nose and cutting edge in their craw. Some versions include either an additional gripping or crimping device at {{the crux of the}} handle side of the pliers' joint. Lineman's pliers typically are machined from forged steel and the two handles precisely joined with a heavy-duty rivet that maintains the pliers' accuracy even after repeated use under extreme force on heavy-gauge wire. Lineman's pliers usually have grips for better handling than bare metal handles; the grips may also provide insulation for protection against electric shock when working with live circuits, although most models are marked as not listed for such use. Some pliers are certified to withstand a specified voltage, e.g. 1000V.|$|R
