If additional parties were added to the same line, distinctive ringing patterns would need to be used to identify the called subscriber; these were audible to the multiple users on the line.|$|E

The lines consist of two 0. 4 mm (or 0. 5 mm) diameter copper wires with centers separated by 1. 0 mm. The air spaced <b>two-wire</b> <b>lines</b> show transform-limited TEM mode pulse propagation with very small group velocity dispersion (GVD), and relatively low attenuation. Our achieved performance {{with a power}} loss of 5. 8 dB/m approaches that needed formm-wave and THz interconnects. The coupling was enabled by two tungsten probes with 1 mdiameter tips in near-contact (5 m gap) with the coplanar transmission lines on the transmitting and receiving op-toelectronic chips. The air spaced <b>two-wire</b> <b>line’s</b> relatively small, measured pulse amplitude attenuation coefficient was 1. 31 {{times larger than the}} theoretical prediction for the TEMmode. This dis-crepancy is considered to be primarily due to reduction of the Cu conductivity in the THz skin-depth layer.

40|$|A new {{theoretical}} {{approach to the}} problem of the symmetrical linear antenna driven by a <b>two-wire</b> <b>line</b> is presented. Then symmetrical linear antenna and the feeder line are treated as a unique boundary-value problem leading to a system of two simultaneous integral equations containing antenna and line currents as unknown sub-integral functions. The integral equations are approximately solved by the so-called point-matching method. Due to the mutual coupling between the antenna and the line, a new conveniently defined apparent driving-point admittance is to be introduced. The method is applied on several types of linear antennas: Centre driven symmetrical dipole antenna, Centre-driven V-antenna, Cage antenna, H-antenna and System of two parallel non-staggered dipoles antennas, positioned in the air over semi-conducting ground.

Based on the transmission-line equations, the equations are derived to estimate the average voltages, the voltage variations, and {{the sensitivity of the}} voltage to the random translation when transmission lines have random translation in their cross sections. With these equations, the average voltages at the loads, the probability distributions of the voltage variations, and the sensitivity of the voltage to the random translation can be obtained quickly. A <b>two-wire</b> <b>line</b> over the ground is studied by using the proposed method.

40|$|In {{the paper}} we {{presented}} new results in incremental network modelling of two-wire lines in frequency range [0, 3] [GHz], by the uniform RLCG ladders with frequency dependent RL parameters, which are analyzed by using PSPICE.

The basic intention {{of this approach is}} to circumvent solving of telegraph equations or application of other complex, numerically demanding procedures in determining line steady-state responses at selected equidistant points. The key to the modelling method applied is partition of the <b>two-wire</b> <b>line</b> in segments with defined maximum length, whereby a couple of new polynomial approximations of line transcendental functions is introduced. It is proved that the strict equivalency between the short-line segments and their uniform ladder counterparts does not exist, but if some conditions are met, satisfactory approximations could be produced. This is illustrated by several examples of short and moderately long two-wire lines with different terminations, proving the good agreement between the exactly obtained steady-state results and those obtained by PSPICE simulation...|$|E
40|$|UWB (ultra wideband), {{depending}} on the application requirement, is usually referred to 2 : 1 bandwidth for radio/wireless applications. Here in this thesis it {{is also used to}} denote extremely wideband antenna and components at several octave bandwidth, particularly for high frequency applications, such as the 1 – 10 GHz antenna system needed for the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) radio telescope and the 2 – 14 GHz antenna system for the VLBI 2010 (Very Long Base line Interferometer) project. One of the critical parts of an UWB antenna is its feed circuits, because this network must deliver the signal from the UWB antenna to LNAs without introducing losses that severely degrade performance in low noise systems like SKA and VLBI 2010. The first part of this thesis is primarily associated with designing UWB baluns for the decade bandwidth Eleven feed. The second part of the thesis addresses UWB components using the novel gap waveguide technology. The gap waveguide is an UWB technology, because it inherently is more broadband than normal hollow waveguides and can be used over more than octave bandwidth. Also, the gap waveguide is less dispersive than normal hollow waveguide. 	 The decade bandwidth Eleven antenna can be considered to have either four differential ports or eight single-ended ports, and different ways of combining the eight ports are needed for different purposes and applications. The most feasible combination is when the antenna is fed by four baluns; the balun being a device that transforms a balanced <b>two-wire</b> <b>line</b> to an unbalanced coaxial or microstrip line. The first part of the thesis presents a new passive balun solution for the Eleven antenna and a way to integrate four of these baluns together with the antenna {{in such a way that}} the four differential ports transform to four single-ended ports. It is also important to verify and evaluate the radiation efficiency of a multiport antenna before being integrated in the system. This thesis addresses how to measure the radiation efficiency of a multiport antenna excluding the losses in the feeding network used for the measurement, particularly when the impedance match between the antenna and the feeding network is not so perfect. The gap waveguide makes it possible to realize low loss circuits at millimeter and sub-millimeter waves, without having the problems of metal contact between joining metal pieces present when using normal hollow waveguides. The present work includes a study of the resemblance between the groove gap waveguide and the standard hollow rectangular waveguide, and between the ridge gap waveguide and the normal hollow ridge waveguide. The dispersion diagrams and characteristic impedances have been compared. These results are very useful when designing, simulating and measuring gap waveguide components of different kind, because they show under which conditions and accuracies standard waveguide interfaces can be used. Finally, the thesis presents an UWB microstrip power divider that was designed and packaged using gap waveguide technology, and a ridge gap waveguide ring hybrid. The power divider has a bandwidth of 2 – 14 GHz, and it is intended to be used in the feed network for the Eleven feed...|$|E
40|$|Most {{power line}} {{communication}} (PLC) models are designed to date simulate power <b>lines</b> as <b>two-wire</b> <b>lines.</b> However, in alternating current (AC) electrical distribution, the two-wire option is seldom applied, and medium-voltage lines are most often based on the three-phase configuration.

Two-wire models are characterized by limited accuracy, not allowing us to simulate certain major phenomena affecting PLC.

This paper discusses a multi-conductor model that eliminates the disadvantages outlined above; the proposed model exploits the multi-conductor telegrapher’s equations. In order to be able to include medium-voltage (MV) / low-voltage (LV) transformers in medium-voltage network models, we constituted a transformer model.

40|$|Abstract: The {{trend to}} {{low-cost}} distributed data communications over the switched telephone network has developed {{the need to}} integrate even more functions into a single device. Until recently, the baseband to pass band (and vice versa) transformation on the serial data produced by a typical data terminal relied on expensive and bulky external MODEMS to perform that function. This paper will describe {{the implementation of a}} single-chip FSK Modem circuit based on a Programmable System on Chip that integrates a modulator, a demodulator, filters, timers and a baud-rate generator to accomplish that transformation. The goal is to demonstrate the possibilities offered by system-on-chip programmable devices in specific processing systems, where the costs make the use of specific integrated circuits unaffordable. A common way of reducing system costs when low baud rates are acceptable is to use an FSK modem. The modem is responsible for both the transmission and reception of the data encoded signal. The device is capable of transmitting and receiving FSK signals in simplex, half-duplex and asymmetrical full-duplex modes over <b>two-wire</b> <b>lines</b> and symmetrical full-duplex signals over four-wire telephone lines.
