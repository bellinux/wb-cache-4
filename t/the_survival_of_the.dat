5|$|Although other breeds {{were being}} {{increasingly}} imported and bred, {{the numbers of}} the Finnhorse population also slowly began to recover; in 1997, 19,000 Finnhorses existed. Harness racing and associated parimutuel betting, {{and to some degree}} also the relatively new hobby of riding, became the most important factors ensuring <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breed.|$|E

5|$|Hebron {{glass is}} an {{attraction}} for {{both domestic and}} foreign tourists.

He argues that the interventions, by arousing Russian nationalism, may have ensured <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bolshevik state.|$|E

5|$|A Venetian fleet forced Vatatzes' {{naval forces}} to withdraw, {{but after the}} Venetians {{departed}} for home the Greeks and Bulgarians besieged Constantinople again in November 1235. John sent letters to European monarchs and the pope, pleading for assistance. Since <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Latin Empire was in jeopardy, Pope Gregory urged the crusaders to defend Constantinople instead of the Holy Land. A combined naval force from Venice, Genoa, Pisa and Geoffrey II of Achaea broke through the blockade. Asen soon abandoned his alliance with Vatatzes, who was forced to lift the siege in 1236.|$|E
5|$|After {{a stormy}} debate in which <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{government}} was called into question, a compromise was reached whereby Aberhart's government relinquished considerable {{power to a}} committee of backbenchers. This committee, dominated by insurgents, recruited two British social credit experts to come to Alberta and advise on the implementation of social credit. Among the experts' first moves was to require a loyalty pledge from Social Credit MLAs. Almost all signed, thus ending the crisis, {{though most of the}} legislation the experts proposed was ultimately disallowed or struck down as unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese, {{a teenage}} refugee and admirer of John Connor and the Resistance. As portrayed by Michael Biehn in The Terminator, {{he was sent}} {{back in time to}} 1984 to protect Sarah Connor to ensure <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human race, and fathered John with her. Yelchin said he wanted to portray Kyle as Biehn did and not make him appear weaker because it was a younger version of the character. The {{difference}} in his portrayal lies in showing Kyle as intense, but not concentrated until he joins the resistance proper. Yelchin tried to convey Kyle's intensity by focusing on how fast Biehn appeared when running in the original film.|$|E

30|$|However, our {{findings}} slightly differed. As previously mentioned, researches have shown results {{that there are}} no clinical problems encountered with the short implant, but there are definite advantages to using the long implant. In this study, the higher postoperative stability results were confirmed by <b>the</b> longer length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implant. Likewise, Winkler et al.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{exchange}} {{project of the}} late 1980s, activity to export the Finnhorse has been minimal. However, a 2008 study stated that increased international interest and demand for the Finnhorse was advisable to ensure <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breed. To this end, {{the objectives of the}} national breeding program, as of 2008, include increasing international recognition of the Finnhorse and generating demand for the breed for recreational and educational uses such as in Pony Club; to make it the standard breed used in Finland for equestrian tourism; and to improve the opportunities for Finnhorse trotters to participate in Swedish and Norwegian heats.|$|E
5|$|As senior officer, Lamason {{had access}} to the main camp and quickly built a rapport with the group. As a result, he was able to secure extra blankets, clothes, clogs and food for the airmen. Lamason also built a rapport with two other prisoners; French {{scientist}} Alfred Balachowsky and Dutch Olympian trainer Jan Robert. Both men had developed trustworthy contacts within the camp administrative area and were able to provide Lamason with reliable intelligence that assisted in <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airmen.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} year of his administration, Jones and five others were {{traveling}} in a state helicopter from Frankfort to Fort Knox when a tail rotor blade snapped, causing the helicopter to crash in Shelby County. The pilot was able to guide the helicopter into a treetop to soften the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and a bruised kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and co-pilot had not properly attached an engine cowling that knocked off the tail rotor blade. Both pilots maintained that they did nothing wrong, and Jones credited them for <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passengers aboard the helicopter.|$|E
