5|$|The Arena browser (also {{known as}} the Arena WWW Browser) is an early (now discontinued) <b>testbed</b> Web browser and Web {{authoring}} tool for Unix. Originally authored by Dave Raggett in 1993, the browser continued its development at CERN and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and subsequently by Yggdrasil Computing. As a <b>testbed</b> browser, Arena was used in testing the implementation for HTML version 3.0, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Portable Network Graphics (PNG), and libwww. Arena was widely used and popular {{at the beginning of}} the World Wide Web.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its time}} of development, Arena is {{in certain areas}} a {{relatively}} modern browser; because it functioned as a <b>testbed,</b> it saw the implementation of new technologies long before they became mainstream, e.g. CSS.

40|$|Abstract—Automated <b>test</b> {{design is}} an {{approach}} to <b>test</b> design in which automata are utilized for generating <b>test</b> artifacts such as <b>test</b> cases and <b>test</b> data from a formal <b>test</b> basis, most often called <b>test</b> model. A <b>test</b> generator operates on such a <b>test</b> model to meet a certain <b>test</b> coverage goal. In the plethora of the approaches, tools and standards for model-based <b>test</b> design, the <b>test</b> design techniques to be applied and <b>test</b> coverage goals to be met {{are not part of}} the <b>test</b> model, which may easily lead to difficulties regarding comprehensibility and repeatability of the <b>test</b> design process. This paper analyzes current approaches to and languages for automated model-based <b>test</b> design and shows that they are lacking important information about the applied <b>test</b> design techniques. Based on this analysis, we propose to introduce another layer of abstraction for expressing <b>test</b> design techniques in a tool-independent, yet generic way.

5|$|The W3C and the INRIA, a French {{national}} research institution, gave additional funding to develop CSS. To better implement and write CSS, an experimental style sheet for Arena was developed.

The E-10 MC2A would have included an all-new AWACS system, with a powerful active electronically scanned array (AESA) that was also capable of jamming enemy aircraft or missiles. One 767-400ER aircraft was produced as a <b>testbed</b> for systems integration, but the program was terminated in January 2009 and the prototype was sold to Bahrain as a VIP transport.|$|E
5|$|Airborne Research Integrated Experiments System – ARIES, a NASA {{platform}} for air safety and operational research, {{was created in}} 1999 using the second production 757. The aircraft originally flew in the 757 flight test program before entering service with Eastern Air Lines. After NASA purchased the aircraft in 1994 to replace its 737-100 <b>testbed,</b> it was initially used to evaluate a hybrid laminar flow control system, avionics systems for the proposed Northrop YF-23 jet fighter, and the 777's fly-by-wire control system. Equipped with a flight deck research station, on-board laboratories, and two experimental flight decks, ARIES was used for evaluating weather information and landing approach systems, as well as runway friction tests. ARIES went into storage in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to a showcase for visual improvements, Lost Coast acted as a <b>testbed</b> for Valve's commentary system. When the feature is enabled, additional items appear in the game that can be interacted with to play an audio commentary. Each audio piece ranges from ten seconds to a minute of commentary. Players hear the developers {{talk about what the}} player is seeing, what is happening, why they made certain decisions, and what kinds of challenges they faced. Commentary tracks are represented by floating speech bubbles called commentary nodes. Valve intended for players to first play the level with commentary disabled, and after completing the level, play it again with commentary enabled, learning about each new stage as they progress. The company has since made the commentary system standard in all of its later video games.|$|E

40|$|Ensuring Fair <b>Testing</b> Practices 2 The {{focus of}} <b>tests</b> today oftentimes centers {{on ways to}} provide good quality <b>tests</b> to <b>test</b> takers in a {{cost-effective}} manner.
