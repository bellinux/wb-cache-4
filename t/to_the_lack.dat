5|$|As of 2014, {{researchers}} have identified 119 documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants from historical records. The exact number still remains unclear because many Hawaiians enlisted and served under Anglicized names, and {{little is known}} about them due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of detailed records.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the peasants' arsenals, Egypt's military possessed modern arms and artillery. The use of cannons on open battlefields in particular inflicted heavy losses on the rebels.

5|$|The P-7 variant's {{history is}} unclear. The P-8 {{was said to}} have been similar to the H-5 fitted with dual controls.

5|$|A recent phenomenon, the {{migration}} of rural Chinese workers began in 1984 when the Regulations of Permanent Residence Registration became less punitive and allowed people to move to find employment. People left rural areas to escape poverty, and females left due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of local opportunities for women. In the cities, women could find new, low-paid factory-based jobs that did not require highly skilled workers. According to national statistics, the ratio of male to female migrant workers averages 2:1, and an estimated 30-40 million of the migrant women work in the cities, namely Hong Kong and Shenzhen.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the storm, the JMA issued 99typhoon bulletins, warning {{residents}} about Mireille. There were 236warnings {{related to}} storm surge, high winds, waves, and flooding. In Hiroshima, most residents {{were aware of}} the approaching storm, about 70% of residents did not expect significant effects. In general, residents were unprepared for the storm, partly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of recent storms. Transportation in Japan was disrupted after 480domestic flights cancelled, stranding 58,000individuals, and road, rail, and ferry traffic was halted. In Hokkaido, 207schools were closed due to the storm.|$|E

However, it was also argued that the large grass median was sufficient to prevent cross-over collisions, given that Highway410 has a similar median.|$|E
5|$|Ape Escape {{was officially}} {{announced}} in the April 1999 issue of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine. Promotions for the game were held on Cartoon Network during Sony's winter holiday marketing campaign of 1999. A remake of the game, titled Ape Escape: On the Loose, was announced on May 11, 2004, during Sony's press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo. It was released as a launch title for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) on March 24, 2005. The remake features altered controls, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of a right analog stick on the PSP, {{as well as some}} slightly different graphics and mini-games.|$|E

5000|$|Lacan first {{designated}} {{a lack of}} being: what is desired is being itself. [...] "Desire is a relation <b>to</b> being <b>to</b> <b>lack.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lack</b> is <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of being properly speaking. It is not <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of this or that, but lack of being whereby the being exists." [...] (Seminar: The Ego in Freud's Theory) In [...] "The Direction of the Treatment and the Principles of Its Power" [...] (Écrits) Lacan argues that desire is the metonymy of <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of being (manque à être): <b>the</b> subject's <b>lack</b> of being {{is at the heart}} of the analytic experience and the very field in which the neurotic's passion is deployed. In [...] "Guiding Remarks for a Convention on Feminine Sexuality" [...] Lacan contrasts <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of being related <b>to</b> desire with <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of having (manque à avoir) which he relates to demand.|$|R

5|$|Baleen whales have a small, yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey and tracking down other whales. They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of the olfactory bulb, but they do have an olfactory tract. Baleen whales have few if any taste buds, suggesting they have lost their sense of taste. They do retain salt-receptor taste-buds suggesting that they can taste saltiness.|$|E
5|$|Before 2010, the {{computing}} {{reliability of}} GPGPU consumer-grade hardware was largely unknown, and circumstantial evidence related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of built-in error detection and correction in GPU memory raised reliability concerns. In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific accuracy, a 2010 study of over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home network detected soft {{errors in the}} memory subsystems of two-thirds of the tested GPUs. These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the study concluded that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as {{attention is paid to}} the hardware traits, such as software-side error detection.|$|E
