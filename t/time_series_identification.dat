Moreover, it is established the result on the estimate {{of the degree of}} convergence of the LS estimates for infinite AR model. Such an approach has been studied before for the "long" AR models but an overall convergence analysis has been lacking.

40|$|On the {{relation}} between CCA and predictor-based subspace identification. Abstract — There is experimental evidence that a recently proposed subspace algorithm based on predictor identification has a behavior which {{is very close to}} prediction error methods in certain simple examples; this observation raises a question concerning its optimality. It is known that <b>time</b> <b>series</b> <b>identification</b> using the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) approach is asymptotically efficient. Asymptotic optimality of CCA has also been proved when measured inputs are white. In this paper we study {{the relation}} between the standard CCA approach and the recently proposed subspace procedure based on predictor identification (PBSID 1 from now on). In this paper we work under the assumption that there is no feedback; it is shown that CCA and PBSID are asymptotically equivalent precisely in the situations when CCA is optimal. The equivalence holds only asymptotically in the number of data and in the limit as the past horizon goes to infinity. Using some recent results on the asymptotic variance we report counter-examples showing that PBSID is not efficiency in general when measured inputs are not white. I...|$|E

40|$|Control charts {{based on}} Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) tests are {{attractive}} from both a {{theoretical and practical}} point of view. In particular, {{in the case of}} an autocorrelated process, the GLR test uses the information contained in the time-varying response after a change and, as shown by Apley and Shi, is able to outperfom traditional control charts applied to residuals. In addition, a GLR chart provides estimates of the magnitude and the time of occurrence of the change. In this paper, we present a practical approach to the implementation of GLR charts for monitoring an autoregressive and moving average process assuming that only a Phase I sample is available. The proposed approach, based on automatic <b>time</b> <b>series</b> <b>identification,</b> estimates the GLR control limits via stochastic approximation using bootstrap resampling. Thus, it is able to take into account the uncertainty about the underlying model.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} a recently proposed subspace method based on predictor identification (PBSID), known also as ldquowhitening filter algorithm,rdquo and the classical CCA algorithm. The comparison is motivated by i) the fact that CCA {{is known to be}} asymptotically efficient for <b>time</b> <b>series</b> <b>identification</b> and optimal for white measured inputs and ii) some recent results showing that a number of recently developed algorithms are very closely related to PBSID. We show that PBSID is asymptotically equivalent to CCA precisely in the situations in which CCA is optimal while an ldquooptimizedrdquo version of PBSID behaves no worse than CCA also for nonwhite inputs. Even though PBSID (and its optimized version) are consistent regardless of the presence of feedback, in this paper we work under the assumption that there is no feedback to make the comparison with CCA meaningful. The results of this paper imply that the ldquooptimizedrdquo PBSID, besides being able to handle feedback, is to be preferred to CCA also when there is no feedback; only in very specific cases (white or no inputs) are the two algorithms (asymptotically) equivalent...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we aim at}} {{monitoring}} the water balance over the semi-arid plain of Tensift/Marrakech, a 2000 km intensively cropped area in center of Morocco. This requires firstly to map the land use, secondly to monitor the vegetation dynamics, and thirdly to evaluate evapotranspiration, which is the key-variable of water balance in semi-arid plains. In this context, we investigate the potential offered by Terra-MODIS satellite, which provide a costless daily global coverage of the Earth. We use a six-year archive of 16 -day composite NDVI images from 2000 - 2001 to 2005 - 2006 agricultural seasons. However, the use of medium (250 m) spatial resolution data makes difficult to directly monitor land surfaces.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} {{recurrent}} fuzzy neural net-work (RFNN) structure for identifying and controlling nonlinear dynamic systems. The RFNN is inherently a recurrent multilayered connectionist network for realizing fuzzy inference using dynamic fuzzy rules. Temporal relations {{are embedded in}} the network by adding feedback connections in the second layer of the fuzzy neural network (FNN). The RFNN expands the basic ability of the FNN to cope with temporal problems. In addition, results for the FNN-fuzzy inference engine, universal approximation, and convergence analysis are extended to the RFNN. For the control problem, we present the direct and indirect adaptive control approaches using the RFNN. Based on the Lyapunov stability approach, rigorous proofs are presented to guarantee the convergence of the RFNN by choosing appropriate learning rates. Finally, the RFNN is ap-plied in several simulations (<b>time</b> <b>series</b> prediction, <b>identification,</b> and control of nonlinear systems). The results confirm the effec-tiveness of the RFNN. Index Terms—Control, fuzzy logic, fuzzy neural network (FNN), identification, neural network. I...|$|R
