5|$|Scholars have differing {{views on}} whether <b>this</b> <b>dialogue</b> is {{evidence}} that in ancient Vedic tradition women were accepted as active participants in spiritual discussions and as scholars of Brahman. Wendy Doniger, an American Indologist {{and a professor of}} History of Religions, states that in <b>this</b> <b>dialogue</b> Maitreyi is not portrayed as an author, but is part of an Upanishadic story of a Brahmin with two wives who are distinguished by their intellect. Karen Pechelis, another American Indologist and a professor of Comparative Religion, in contrast, states that Maitreyi is portrayed as theologically minded, as she challenges Yajnavalkya in <b>this</b> <b>dialogue</b> and asks the right questions.|$|E
5|$|Maitreyi {{appears in}} ancient Indian texts, {{such as in}} a {{dialogue}} where she explores the Hindu concept of Atman (soul or self) in a dialogue with Yajnavalkya in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. According to <b>this</b> <b>dialogue,</b> love is driven by a person's soul, and Maitreyi discusses the nature of Atman and Brahman and their unity, the core of Advaita philosophy. This Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue is the topic of Sureshvara's varttika, a commentary.|$|E
5|$|Of Antisthenes' Aspasia {{only two}} or three {{quotations}} are extant. <b>This</b> <b>dialogue</b> contains much slander, but also anecdotes pertaining to Pericles' biography. Antisthenes appears to have attacked not only Aspasia, but the entire family of Pericles, including his sons. The philosopher believes that the great statesman chose the life of pleasure over virtue. Thus, Aspasia is presented as the personification of the life of sexual indulgence.|$|E

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>dialogue</b> {{appears in}} several Hindu texts; the {{earliest}} is in chapter 2.4 – and modified in chapter 4.5 – of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, {{one of the}} principal and oldest Upanishads, dating from approximately 700 BCE. The Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue has survived in two manuscript recensions from the Madhyamdina and Kanva Vedic schools; although they have significant literary differences, they share the same philosophical theme.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} titles on the Xbox 360, Halo 3 fully {{supports}} 5.1 surround sound audio. In the game, {{there are over}} 50,000 pieces of audio, with nearly 40,000 of those being NPC dialogue. This {{is far more than}} in either of the preceding Halo titles; Halo 2 had over 15,000 pieces of dialogue. The AI controlling <b>this</b> <b>dialogue</b> is designed to ensure the exchanges flow naturally and convincingly. Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses Waves Audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in-game depending on conditions. Distant gunfire sounds, which may first seem like prerecorded ambient sound, may often be the result of an actual firefight happening elsewhere in the game.|$|E

40|$|<b>This</b> is a <b>dialogue</b> {{between a}} teacher-student and a student-teacher in the {{discipline}} of sociology.

25|$|Concerned {{about the}} {{instability}} of their ally, the U.S. government pushed Musharraf to meet with Bhutto and come to an arrangement that might strengthen his legitimacy. <b>This</b> <b>dialogue</b> was also pushed for by the UK government. In January 2007, Musharraf held {{his first meeting with}} Bhutto at a hotel in Abu Dhabi. The pair underwent follow-up talks in June. As a result of their discussions, it was agreed that the Pakistani authorities would drop all charges of corruption against both Bhutto and her husband. It was also agreed that if Musharraf stepped down from his military positions and was elected as a civilian President, then Bhutto would be willing to serve under him as Prime Minister. As part of their negotiations, Musharraf also agreed to lift the ban on individuals serving more than two terms as Prime Minister. Many of Musharraf's close allies had reservations about his concessions to Bhutto.|$|E
25|$|The first {{dialogue}} between transhumanism and faith was a one-day conference {{held at the}} University of Toronto in 2004. Religious critics alone faulted the philosophy of transhumanism as offering no eternal truths nor {{a relationship with the}} divine. They commented that a philosophy bereft of these beliefs leaves humanity adrift in a foggy sea of postmodern cynicism and anomie. Transhumanists responded that such criticisms reflect a failure to look at the actual content of the transhumanist philosophy, which, far from being cynical, is rooted in optimistic, idealistic attitudes that trace back to the Enlightenment. Following <b>this</b> <b>dialogue,</b> William Sims Bainbridge, a sociologist of religion, conducted a pilot study, published in the Journal of Evolution and Technology, suggesting that religious attitudes were negatively correlated with acceptance of transhumanist ideas and indicating that individuals with highly religious worldviews tended to perceive transhumanism as being a direct, competitive (though ultimately futile) affront to their spiritual beliefs.|$|E
25|$|A {{public meeting}} {{was held in}} December 2011 to discuss the future goals and designs of Union Station, with ideas being {{exchanged}} on how the station can accommodate the expected 40 percent growth in passengers by 2040. The results of <b>this</b> <b>dialogue</b> were incorporated into the May 2012 Chicago Union Station Master Plan Study. The study, led by the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT), in collaboration of Amtrak (station owner), Metra (station’s primary tenant), and other local and federal organizations, calls for increasing the station’s capacity and quality of service. According to the City of Chicago’s website on the study, short-term improvements call for improving station entrances and expanding waiting rooms, as well as enhancing bus lanes on Clinton and Canal Streets and creating a bus terminal on Jackson Boulevard between Canal and Clinton. For the medium-term (5- to 10-year horizon), ideas include widening commuter platforms, using unutilized mail platforms (including an extra-long through platform) for intercity passenger trains, adding more through tracks and platforms, reorganizing facilities for better capacity and flow, increasing height clearances of the tracks, and improving street access {{to and from the}} station. Long-term, proposals include increasing capacity and improving the ambiance of the station by significantly expanding or replacing station facilities in the 200 or 300 blocks of South Canal Street. Adding track and platform capacity along Clinton Street or Canal Street are also analyzed.|$|E
