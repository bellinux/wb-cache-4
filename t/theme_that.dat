5|$|A certain {{detail that}} comes up in the novel is whether we are limited to certain realities, such as 2+2=4, a <b>theme</b> <b>that</b> also comes up in Yevgeny Zamyatin's We and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Dostoevsky {{continues}} {{the use of this}} symbol from his earlier work Notes From Underground where the narrator rants about determinism and logic.|$|E
5|$|Greed is {{the first}} main <b>theme</b> <b>that</b> is {{introduced}} into the book, and specifically the desire to obtain gold. In a similar manner to other themes in the book, it changes throughout, becoming less of a focus near {{to the end of}} the novel, where Artemis is willing to part with a large sum of money to help someone else.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{planning}} for The Swarm began behind closed doors. The ride was codenamed Project LC12 {{in the early}} process of its planning and construction. On 31 January 2011, Thorpe Park submitted a planning application for their 2012 ride to the Runnymede Borough Council. The website gave further information about the new ride's <b>theme,</b> <b>that</b> of an apocalyptic battle.|$|E

5|$|In {{the music}} video Mutual Core {{directed}} by Andrew Thomas Huang, Björk is organically {{part of nature}} and universe. The human connection to nature is a <b>theme</b> <b>that</b> underpins most of her artistic output. It’s particularly meaningful to bring Björk’s vision to 7 continents because of its relevance to all cultures.|$|E
5|$|Original Stories is {{primarily}} about leaving the imperfections of childhood behind {{and becoming a}} rational and charitable adult; it does not romanticise childhood as an innocent and ideal state of being. The inset stories themselves emphasise the balance of reason and emotion required for the girls to become mature, a <b>theme</b> <b>that</b> permeates Wollstonecraft's works, particularly A Vindication of the Rights of Woman.|$|E
5|$|The band's early {{sound was}} rooted in post-punk and pop but {{eventually}} grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the century, some of {{the most}} widely read Russian {{literary}} figures focused on feminist motifs in their works. In his later years, Leo Tolstoy argued against the traditional institution of marriage, comparing it to forced prostitution and slavery, a <b>theme</b> <b>that</b> he also touched on in his novel Anna Karenina. In his plays and short stories, Anton Chekhov portrayed a variety of working female protagonists, from actresses to governesses, who sacrificed social esteem and affluence for the sake of financial and personal independence; in spite of this sacrifice, these women are among the few Chekhovian characters who are truly satisfied with their lives.|$|E
5|$|East Coker is {{described}} as a poem of late summer, earth, and faith. As in the other poems of the Four Quartets, each of the five sections holds a <b>theme</b> <b>that</b> is common to each of the poems: time, experience, purgation, prayer, and wholeness. The time theme is stated in the first section as 'In my beginning is my end' which, given proper attention, might prove to lead into the eternal moment.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman {{notes that}} A Free Ride {{contains}} many fundamental constituents {{which are the}} characteristics of an archetypal pornographic film. He identifies these basic constituents as a carefully planned but not complicated state of affairs to provide introductory motivation, visual stimuli to sexually excite the women, a <b>theme</b> <b>that</b> is generally rare in reality, a straightforward and very quick seduction, and the sex acts as the film's central theme.|$|E

5|$|Kurosawa {{wasted no}} time moving onto his next project: Madadayo, or Not Yet. Based on autobiographical essays by Hyakken Uchida, the film follows {{the life of a}} Japanese {{professor}} of German through the Second World War and beyond. The narrative centers on yearly birthday celebrations with his former students, during which the protagonist declares his unwillingness to die just yet—a <b>theme</b> <b>that</b> was becoming increasingly relevant for the film's 81-year-old creator. Filming began in February 1992 and wrapped by the end of September. Its release on April 17, 1993, was greeted by an even more disappointed reaction than had been the case with his two preceding works.|$|E
5|$|Seven Halo soundtracks {{have been}} released. The Halo Original Soundtrack {{contains}} most of Combat Evolveds music. Due to the varying nature of gameplay, the music present {{was designed to}} use the game's dynamic audio playback engine. The engine allows for the mood, theme, and duration of music played to change according to gameplay. To afford a more enjoyable listening experience, O'Donnell rearranged portions of the music of Halo into standalone suites, which follow the narrative course of the game. The soundtrack also contains music not used in the game, including {{a variation on the}} Halo <b>theme</b> <b>that</b> was first played at Halos debut at Macworld 1999.|$|E
5|$|The Test {{selectors}} made five {{changes to}} the team who had played in the previous Test match. Significantly, Australia's most successful bowler Clarrie Grimmett was replaced by Ward, one of four players making their debut. Bradman's role in Grimmett's omission from the team was controversial {{and it became a}} <b>theme</b> <b>that</b> dogged Bradman as Grimmett continued to be prolific in domestic cricket while his successors were ineffective—he was regarded as having finished the veteran bowler's Test career in a political purge.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} between civilization and barbarism mirrors Latin America's {{difficulties in the}} post-Independence era. Literary critic Sorensen Goodrich argues that although Sarmiento {{was not the first}} to articulate this dichotomy, he forged it into a powerful and prominent <b>theme</b> <b>that</b> would impact Latin American literature. He explores the issue of civilization versus the cruder aspects of a caudillo culture of brutality and absolute power. Facundo set forth an oppositional message that promoted a more beneficial alternative for society at large. Although Sarmiento advocated various changes, such as honest officials who understood enlightenment ideas of European and Classical origin, for him education was the key.|$|E
5|$|The extant folios of the {{manuscript}} start with the fragment of the glossary of Hebrew names. This fragment occupies the left-hand column of folio 1r. A miniature of the four evangelist symbols, now much abraded, make up the right-hand column. The miniature is oriented so that the volume must be turned ninety degrees to view it properly. The four evangelist symbols are a visual <b>theme</b> <b>that</b> runs throughout the book. They are almost always shown together to emphasise {{the doctrine of the}} four Gospels' unity of message.|$|E
5|$|The manga series Hibiki's Magic {{is written}} by Jun Maeda and {{illustrated}} by Rei Izumi. As stated {{at the back of}} the first volume, Maeda first conceived Hibiki's Magic as a short story he wrote as a student, and the story contains an unspecified <b>theme</b> <b>that</b> he has carried through a lot of stories since. In 2003, he wanted to collaborate with Izumi, one of his favorite artists, and remembered his earlier concept that would become Hibiki's Magic. After Izumi drew some early character designs for Hibiki, Maeda wanted to continue the story and start a manga with Izumi as the artist.|$|E

5|$|For the music, the {{development}} team felt that symphony orchestra would {{work best for}} Knights of the Old Republic II. The musical score was composed by Mark Griskey, who developed music and themes for characters and places, including the Jedi's theme, Darth Sion's theme and Darth Nihilus's theme (which both have many similarities with the Emperor's theme from The Return of the Jedi). He also created a theme for the main character, which is heard occasionally {{when he or she}} experiences internal conflict. The 70-minute score was recorded by the Sinfonia Orchestra in Seattle. The opening crawl utilizes the version of John Williams' main Star Wars <b>theme</b> <b>that</b> was re-recorded for the prequel trilogy.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a <b>theme</b> <b>that</b> resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
5|$|III. Scherzo: Allegro vivace – Trio: Un poco più lento. The A {{section of}} the scherzo uses a playful leaping rolled chord figure that is rhythmically and harmonically {{reminiscent}} of the opening bars of the sonata. The B section {{is dominated by the}} juxtaposition of two distant tonal realms. It commences in C-major for a rollicking <b>theme</b> <b>that</b> is abruptly interrupted by a downward-rushing C-sharp minor scale without any modulatory preparation, in a striking cyclic reference to the climax of the preceding movement's middle section. Following this outburst, the B section quietly ends in C-sharp minor a grace-note melody identical in contour to a figure from the theme of the Andantino (2–1–7–1–3–1), before modulating back to the movement's tonic. C major returns in the concluding A section, this time more tonally integrated into its A-major surroundings, by modulatory sequences. The ternary form trio in D major uses hand crossing to add melodic accompaniment to the chordal theme, and is rhythmically and harmonically based on the opening of the Allegro.|$|E
