Due to the steepness of Route Twisk, the route was served using Albions {{for a long period of}} time. At that time, the route ran between Jordan Road Ferry Pier and Yuen Long, and was initially an express route, having only two stops between Lai Chi Kok and Shek Kong, which were at Tsuen Wan Town Centre and Tai Mo Shan.

50|$|Coinciding {{around the}} same time, in the late 19th century, Gravesend served as a testing ground for the Boynton Bicycle Railroad, the {{earliest}} forerunner of the monorail. The BBR consisted of a single-wheeled engine that hauled two double-decker passenger cars along a single track; a second rail above the train, supported by wooden arches, kept it from tipping over. The engine and cars were only four feet wide and were capable of speeds far greater than the much bulkier standard trains. In 1889, the BBR began running a short route between the Gravesend stop of the Sea Beach Railroad (near the intersection of 86th and West Seventh Streets) and Brighton Beach in Coney Island, a distance of just over a mile. Despite the smooth and speedy ride the BBR offered riders, it ultimately failed and the <b>test</b> <b>route</b> fell into disuse, along with the Boynton train itself and the shed that was built to house it.|$|E

30|$|A Swedish {{motorway}} with {{a normal}} speed limit of 110  km/h {{was used as a}} <b>test</b> <b>route.</b> The route was a replicate of the E 4 between Linköping and Jönköping, driving on the right side.

This was to increase the realism, in addition every 7  min a car overtook the test driver. Half-way through the <b>test</b> <b>route,</b> the posted speed limit was changed to 90  km/h for 1  km, because there was a similar change of speed on the real road simulated. The total length of the simulator <b>test</b> <b>route</b> was about 150  km and it took approximately 75 – 80  min to drive. The subjects were instructed to drive as they would do in “real life”.

The next paragraph discusses various parameters of drivers and the road environment that possibly moderate the outcome of a study for each of the effects Listed above.

30|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} {{positioning of the}} vehicle along the <b>test</b> <b>route</b> is still a challenge since each of the used technologies has advantages and disadvantages. Optical positioning (cameras, stereo cameras, Lidar) requires visible orientation marks (e.g. road markers) or an optical reference map (e.g. LIDAR). In addition to the elaborate recording and maintenance of these reference data, driving environments with (partly) missing or insufficient road markings (along the <b>test</b> <b>route</b> in Koppl) and (partly) missing reference objects (e.g. along meadows or in tunnels) are problematic. Therefore, optical positioning works only for parts of the <b>test</b> <b>route</b> in Koppl (along the short route in the village centre), while {{it does not work}} reliably for the parts with missing reference objects. Multi-GNSS Real-time Kinematics (RTK) is a suitable technology to obtain centimetre-accurate positions using satellite positioning [17]. The prerequisite for centimetre-accurate GNSS-positioning is a reliable correction signal from a near GNSS reference base. This signal is transmitted either via mobile radio (3 G/ 4 G) from an Internet-based correction service (e.g. APOS service in Austria) or as in Koppl from a local reference station (e.g. via UHF frequencies) due to missing reliability of the mobile radio connection on parts of the route.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation of human control of vehicles {{carried out on}} the basis of general theories on human movement. The longitudinal and lateral accelerations are studied, and their relations with theories of motor optimality principles, such as minimum jerk, minimum variance, and the two-thirds power law are highlighted. Data have been collected during the final experimental phase of the EU interactIVe project, in which a vehicle developed by Centro Ricerche Fiat has been used to demonstrate driver continuous support produced by an artificial co-driver, within a shared initiative framework. 24 subjects drove the vehicle on a <b>test</b> <b>route</b> twice: once with the system active, the other with the system silent. The <b>test</b> <b>route</b> is composed of urban arterials, extra urban and motorway roads, and takes approximately 40 – 45  min to be driven. The total database thus amounts to ~ 35  h of driving data recordings, for a total of ~ 1.2  M samples per signal. Statistical summary data are presented, which describe human preferred accelerations, correlation between acceleration, curvature, and speed, and between longitudinal and lateral acceleration. Different driving modalities, corresponding to different motor strategies and primitives, are revealed. Comparisons with literature data are also made and discussed. The summary statistics may be useful for the design of future ADAS systems, and indeed they have been collected for the final tuning of the interactIVe co-driver.|$|E
30|$|Other {{conceivable}} biasing {{factors are}} the traffic, which is specific to Aracaju–SE, unique {{characteristics of the}} chosen <b>test</b> <b>route,</b> and meteorological conditions. However, {{we believe that the}} results of our case study would not change substantially in a setting where these factors were altered. Moreover, a situation highlighted by Paefgen et al. [54] and not considered by us was smartphone use during the case study. For instance, handling a smartphone during a call or the execution of other applications would likely have introduced additional noise. The time that drivers drove may have led to a bias in the behavioral analysis. Other studies should be conducted to assess how the peak time influences drivers’ behavior.|$|E
40|$|Background:New {{pharmacological}} entities {{are actively}} sought {{for treatment of}} inherited and age-related retinal degener-ative diseases. Results: Sulfaphenazole, a selective inhibitor of human cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 2 C 9 enzyme, {{was identified as a}} novel cytopro-tective agent against light-induced death of photoreceptors.

Emission factors properly simulate on-road test result, although there is some drawback to consider variety of driving condition on real world. Vehicle specific power and acceleration have been used to explain the distributed on-road result within same vehicle speed range. The trend in carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission with respect to specific power and acceleration is clear.
