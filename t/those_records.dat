5|$|During the American Civil War, White was {{concerned}} {{for the safety}} of the county's records and proceeded to load land registration records ledger books onto wagons and had them transported for safekeeping. Because of White's efforts, Hampshire County land records survived the war, while <b>those</b> <b>records</b> that remained in the courthouse were destroyed. White was threatened by occupying Union Army forces to either vacate his residence in Romney or face arrest because of his Confederate sympathies. White relocated to Richmond and served in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury.|$|E

A Turkish daily newspaper reported that the Turkish Special Forces soldiers, who were captured by US Army and Peshmerga, had already filmed the deed records and sent the digital records to Turkey before the historical records were terminated. The newspaper also reported that the US party was, in fact, in search of <b>those</b> <b>records,</b> but {{they were unable to}} find them. However, Turkish Ministry of Public Works declared that the ministry archives holds historical deed records from the Ottoman era and there were no operations involved.|$|E

5|$|When Woods was 13 years old, {{he played}} in the 1989 Big I, which was his first major {{national}} junior tournament. In the final round, he was paired with pro John Daly, who was then relatively unknown. The event's format placed a professional with each group of juniors who had qualified. Daly birdied three of the last four holes to beat Woods by only one stroke. As a young teenager, Woods first met Jack Nicklaus in Los Angeles at the Bel-Air Country Club, when Nicklaus was performing a clinic for the club's members. Woods was part of the show, and he impressed Nicklaus and the crowd with his skills and potential. Earl Woods had researched in detail the career accomplishments of Nicklaus, and had set his young son the goals of breaking <b>those</b> <b>records.</b>|$|E
25|$|Target {{initially}} {{refused to}} sell Frank Ocean's Channel Orange and Beyoncé's self-titled album, due to <b>those</b> <b>records</b> becoming available to digital retailers, like iTunes, before physical copies were made.

40|$|During electrocochleography, that is, ECochG or ECoG, a {{recording}} electrode {{can be placed}} in the ear canal lateral to the tympanic membrane. We designed a concha electrode to record both sinusoidal waveforms of cochlear microphonics (CMs) and auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). The amplitudes of CM waveforms and Wave I or compound action potentials (CAPs) recorded at the concha were greater than <b>those</b> <b>recorded</b> at the mastoid but slightly lower than <b>those</b> <b>recorded</b> at the ear canal. Wave V amplitudes recorded at the concha were greater than <b>those</b> <b>recorded</b> at the ear canal but lower than <b>those</b> <b>recorded</b> at the mastoid. There was not {{a significant difference between the}} amplitudes recorded at the concha and at the ear canal. For CM and Wave I or CAP, the latency recorded at the concha was longer than at the canal but shorter than at the mastoid; for Wave V, the reverse was true. However, these differences were not statistically significant and may be due to the distance to response generators. Aside from the advantages that the regular ECoG has over otoacoustic emission (OAE) testing, the concha electrode was also easier and safer to place and may be suitable for children, newborn screening, participants with canal conditions, and remote clinics which could have concerns with the availability and cost of a canal electrode. Using concha electrodes, we also experienced fewer postauricular artifacts than when using a mastoid electrode...|$|R
25|$|Before the government's {{registration}} system was created, evidence of births and/or baptisms (and also marriages and death or burials) {{was dependent on}} the events being recorded in {{the records of the}} Church of England or in those of other various churches – not all of which maintained such records or all types of <b>those</b> <b>records.</b> Copies of such records are not issued by the General Register Office; but can be obtained from these churches, or from the local or national archive, which usually now keeps the records in original or copy form.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{entities}} {{in possession}} of medical records are required to maintain <b>those</b> <b>records</b> for a given period.

25|$|In {{the postwar}} period, and after nearly 20 years of isolation, many music fans {{as well as}} musicians {{themselves}} were {{very interested in the}} movements of jazz they had missed. In fact, jazz gave young people the enthusiastic hope for rebuilding the country. In the jazz clubs, jazz lovers played important records even before they could organize concerts. As World War II ended, jazz was imported to Germany via its strong footholds in England and France, and home-grown post-war jazz was able to develop, particularly in the American-occupied zone. Ironically, many German prisoners first heard jazz in French camps, and then the occupying Allied forces introduced <b>those</b> <b>records</b> and sheet music into the country. Berlin, Bremen and Frankfurt became centers of jazz. Young German musicians could perform before a larger audience in American GI venues.|$|E
25|$|Brady {{finished}} {{the season with}} 4,806 passing yards, 50 touchdown passes, and only eight interceptions. It was unanimously voted the greatest passing season of all time by ESPN in 2013. His 50:8 touchdown to interception ratio was, at the time, an NFL record. He became the first quarterback to pass for 50 touchdowns in a season and his 117.2 passer rating is the fourth highest in a single season. His 8.7% touchdown passing percentage is the third highest ever in a season. He led the Patriots to becoming {{the first team to}} ever go undefeated in the regular season since the 16 game schedule was enforced and directed an offense that scored a then NFL record 589 points and 75 total touchdowns. <b>Those</b> <b>records</b> stood until they were eclipsed by the 2013 Denver Broncos. The team's 50 total touchdown passes is the fourth most ever in a season. For his efforts, Brady was named the Most Valuable Player of this season, as well as Offensive Player of the Year. He was also honored by the Associated Press as their Male Athlete of the Year, the first time an NFL player has been so honored since Joe Montana won the award in 1990.|$|E
