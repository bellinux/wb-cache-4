40|$|An {{iterative}} scheme {{can be used}} to find a steady-state {{solution to}} the Boltzmann equation, however, it is very slow to converge in the near-continuum flow regime. In this paper, a synthetic iterative scheme is developed to speed up the solution of the linearized Boltzmann equation. The velocity distribution function is first solved by the conventional iterative scheme, then it is corrected such that the macroscopic flow velocity is governed by a diffusion equation which is asymptotic-preserving in the Navier-Stokes limit. The efficiency of the new scheme is verified by calculating the eigenvalue of the iteration, as well as solving for Poiseuille and thermal <b>transpiration</b> <b>flows.</b> The synthetic iterative scheme is significantly faster than the conventional iterative scheme in both the transition and the near-continuum flow regimes. Moreover, due to the asymptotic-preserving properties, the SIS needs less spatial resolution in the near-continuum flow regimes, which makes it even faster than the conventional iterative scheme. Using this synthetic iterative scheme, and the fast spectral approximation of the linearized Boltzmann collision operator, Poiseuille and thermal <b>transpiration</b> <b>flows</b> between two parallel plates, through channels of circular/rectangular cross sections, and various porous media are calculated over the whole range of gas rarefaction.

Here we assess the accuracy the Maxwell, Epstein, and Cercignani-Lampis BCs, by comparing numerical results of the Boltzmann equation for the Lennard-Jones potential to experimental data on Poiseuille and thermal <b>transpiration</b> <b>flows.</b> The four experiments considered are: Ewart et al.

Minute variations in fruit growth and in phloem, xylem, and <b>transpiration</b> <b>flows</b> were determined at cell division (stage I) and at cell expansion (stage III) during fruit development on several fruit per treatment, using highly sensitive fruit gauges. During cell expansion, the thinning treatments were also compared for their effects on fruit water potential. At stage I, no difference between treatments was found in any of the flows, suggesting that fresh matter (FM) import from phloem and xylem is sink-limited during early fruit development. At stage III, HCL fruit were smaller and had higher specific transpiration rates during the day. Xylem flow did not show any source limitations due to high crop load. However, it was “sink-strengthened ” in the afternoon, in HCL, as these fruit reached lower water potentials during the day. Phloem flow to HCL fruit was source-limited during the afternoon, and at night, due to fruit-to-fruit competition. However, HCL fruit appeared to take advantage of their lower water potential at midday, when they showed higher rates of phloem flow. Although daily growth in HCL fruit undergoes periods of source limitation, this study showed how, at certain times of day, fruit may be more active sinks in attracting resources in high cropping conditions than at low crop loads.

Distal plantlets fixed approx. 20 % more 14 C than proximal plantlets, by virtue of greater dry weight. Manipulative growth analysis of the paracladial zone suggests the operation of a system of apicaldominance, with distal plantlets becoming dominant over proximal plantlets. At dehiscence, distal plantlets were more likely to become established, and possessed relative growth rates more than ten times those of proximal plantlets. Paracladial heterogeneity was also apparent as an increased proportion of aborted spikelets on proximal paracladia. Data indicate that this abortion was, at least in part, a result of constraint imposed by the pseudostem on the developing synflorescence. When grown in conditions of differing resource availability (altered nutrient supply and atmospheric C 02 concentration), low nutrient availability in concert with elevated C 02 concentration induced particularly low photosynthetic nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiencies inboth parent and plantlet tissues. This occurred in concert with acclimatory loss of photosynthetic capacity leading to a decreased reproductive response of the plant; a product of the number of tillers in flower and the subsequent growth of attached plantlets. lt is predicted that in future climatic conditions Poa alpina will decline in habitats that include species which exhibit less acclimatory loss, no change, or an increase in photosynthetic capacity.

In this paper, a synthetic iterative scheme is developed {{to speed up the}} solution of the linearized Boltzmann equation by penalizing the collision operator L into the form L=(L+Nδh) -Nδh, where δ is the gas rarefaction parameter, h is the velocity distribution function, and N is a tuning parameter controlling the convergence rate. The velocity distribution function is first solved by the conventional iterative scheme, then it is corrected such that the macroscopic flow velocity is governed by a diffusion-type equation that is asymptotic-preserving into the Navier-Stokes limit. The efficiency of this new scheme is assessed by calculating the eigenvalue of the iteration, as well as solving for Poiseuille and thermal <b>transpiration</b> <b>flows.</b> We find that the fastest convergence of our synthetic scheme for the linearized Boltzmann equation is achieved when Nδ is close to the average collision frequency.

These flows are rarefied, within the slip and transitional flow regimes, which are beyond many traditional {{computational fluid dynamic}} simulation schemes, such as those based on the continuum flow assumption.

The adopted method {{is a combination of}} particle and gas kinetic methods and it can simulate micro-flows properly. The simulation results of mass flow rates have excellent agreement with experimental measurements. Another finding from this study is that numerical simulations by including two reservoirs at the channel ends lead to appreciable differences in simulation results of velocity and pressure distributions within the micro-channel. This is due to the inhaling and exhaling effects of reservoirs at the channel ends. Even though excluding those reservoirs may accelerate the simulations significantly by using a single channel in simulations, special attentions are needed because this treatment may over-simplify the problem, and some procedures and results may be questionable.

40|$|The {{decline in}} xylem flow {{during the late}} growth stage in most fruits may be due either to a {{decrease}} in the water potential gradient between the stem bearing the fruit and the fruit tissues or to {{a decrease in the}} hydraulic conductivity of xylem vessels, or both. In this study, we analysed changes in xylem flows to the mango Mangifera indica L. fruit during its development to identify the sources of variation by measuring changes in the water potential gradient and in the hydraulic properties of the fruit pedicel. The variations in xylem and <b>transpiration</b> <b>flows</b> were estimated at several stages of mango fruit development from the daily changes in the fresh mass of detached and girdled fruits on branches. The water potential gradient was estimated by monitoring the diurnal water potential in the stem and fruit. The hydraulic properties of the fruit pedicel were estimated using a flow meter. The results indicated that xylem flow increased {{in the early stages of}} fruit development and decreased in the late stage. Variations in xylem flow were related to the decrease in the hydraulic conductivity of xylem vessels but not to a decrease in the water potential gradient. The hydraulic conductivity of the fruit pedicel decreased during late growth due to embolism caused by a decrease in the fruit water potential.

40|$|Fluid {{and thermal}} {{problems}} are widely encountered in micro/nano-scale devices, the characteristic lengths {{of which are}} from hundreds of microns down to tens of nanometers. A great number of such devices involve fundamental components like microchannels, capillaries, membranes and cantilever beams. Continuum assumptions that lead to classical governing equations such as Navier-Stokes equations and Fourier Laws break down when the characteristic size shrinks by an order of millions. In addition, conventional sensors, actuators and controllers turn to be insufficient to depict the flow, thermal, or electrical fields in micro-devices without impacting the original conditions greatly. Therefore, the development of numerical methods becomes indispensable in design and performance analysis of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). The main goal of this PhD research is the development, implementation and application of comprehensive deterministic Boltzmann-ESBGK modeling framework to micro-scale fluid-thermal phenomena. ^ Investigation of gas flows in short rectangular microchannels {{has been carried out}} to understand the rarefaction effects on the reduced mass-flow-rate as well as the non-equilibrium effects on the temperature components. At high Knudsen numbers, the reduced mass-flow-rate only depends on the pressure ratio and the temperature components deviate at the channel exit. For gas flows in long microchannels with and without constrictions, the Navier-Stokes equations with first-order slip boundary conditions are solved. Numerical results accurately predict the entrance pressure drop comparing to high-resolution experimental data using pressure-sensitive-paint (PSP). Simultions show clearly that the compressibility effects become less important than the rarefaction effects at low pressures. ^ The coupled gas-phonon Boltzmann solver has been developed. The reduced distribution functions are used in the two-dimensional code to reduce the computational cost. The physical space is discretized in Cartesian coordinate, while the velocity space is discretized in polar coordinate. The Gaussian-Hermite quadrature is applied to the velocity magnitude. Boundary conditions including temperature, pressure, symmetry as well as far-field are implemented. The interfacial gas-phonon coupling is solved based on conservations of mass, momentum and energy. Good agreements have been obtained from comparisons of current simulations with other numerical models, analytical solutions and experimental data for benchmark cases. ^ The work on temperature-driven microflows includes two major parts: contact thermal resistance over constrictions and thermal <b>transpiration</b> <b>flows</b> in a closed system. The verification of heat transfer at gas-solid surfaces is conducted by comparison with theoretical solutions, where the infinite thin constrictions are considered. For finite constrictions, the heat flux through the interface can be much less than analytical predictions. The coupling effects in thermal <b>transpiration</b> <b>flows</b> can not be ignored when gas flows are in transitional and free-molecular regimes. The effective temperature gradient should be calculated using the wall temperatures at the entrance and exit of the channel, which are different from the temperatures at the inlet and outlet chamber. In addition, when the phonon mean-free-path becomes comparable to the membrane thickness, the assumption for linear wall temperature distribution becomes invalid. ^ The deterministic Boltzmann solver has been also applied to micro-scale aerodynamic damping problems. Based on fifty simulations over a broad range of Knudsen number and geometry, a compact model {{in the form of a}} rational function is generated. The fitting is examined by various statistical criteria. The developed compact model is accurate for cantilever/squeeze-film damping problems with small amplitude vibrations by comparison with experimental measurements with various geometries and flow conditions. The compact model is also used to conduct uncertainty quantification with input probability distribution functions (PDFs) of geometry and environment parameters. The results agree well with the generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) predictions. In rarefied transitional flow regime, the damping force is highly non-linear. It is shown that the bias between the averaged damping coefficient and the damping coefficient of the averaged input value can be over 10 % at ambient pressure conditions. ...|$|R

This study found that annual water income (rainfall plus fog water) was 1440 mm year - 1, half of which was occult (or fog) precipitation, while stand transpiration estimated from measurements of sap flow amounted, annually, to 40 % of potential evapotranspiration calculated from measurements of meteorological variables. The positive role of crest laurel forests, which transpire less water than is incoming from rain and fog is emphasised.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the tree {{energetic}} balance {{closely related to the}} phenomenon of plant transpiration. Living systems have a unique ability to equilibrate gradients in the nature. Storing energy of the incoming solar radiation into a latent heat of water evaporation is an example of such tree feature. It dissipates energy and simultaneously recycles nutrients and water in the ecosystem. There are few possible ways of energy balance detection shown in this work. The thermal imagining {{can be used as a}} method for an indirect indication of transpiration - transpiring plants have lower leaf surface temperature. An alternative method for determining the rate of transpiration is a direct measurement of transpiration on leaves or <b>transpiration</b> <b>flow</b> in a tree trunk. However, extrapolation of the above mentioned methods to entire stands can encounter some difficulties. The first part of the thesis presents a description of a physical background of energetic processes and the ways in which plants operate with water, the biotic pump theory is being discussed. The practical part begins with experiments on single leaves. These experiments are carried out to test the usability of the methods for the following experiments, which are performed on the entire living trees. They are focused on the relationship of the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Isotope {{labelling}} is {{a powerful}} tool to study elemental cycling within terrestrial ecosystems. Here we describe a new multi-isotope technique to label organic matter (OM). We exposed poplars (Populus deltoides × nigra) for 14 days to an atmosphere enriched in 13 CO 2 and depleted in 2 H 2 18 O. After 1 week, the water-soluble leaf OM (δ 13 C = 1346 ± 162 ‰) and the leaf water were strongly labelled (δ 18 O = − 63 ± 8, δ 2 H = − 156 ± 15 ‰). The leaf water isotopic composition was between the atmospheric and stem water, indicating a considerable back-diffusion of vapour into the leaves (58 – 69 %) {{in the opposite direction}} to the net <b>transpiration</b> <b>flow.</b> The atomic ratios of the labels recovered (18 O/ 13 C, 2 H/ 13 C) were 2 – 4 times higher in leaves than in the stems and roots. This could be an indication of the synthesis of more condensed compounds in roots and stems (e. g. lignin vs. cellulose) or might be the result of O and H exchange and fractionation processes during phloem transport and biosynthesis. We demonstrate that the three major OM elements (C, O, H) can be labelled and traced simultaneously within the plant. This approach could be of interdisciplinary interest in the fields of plant physiology, palaeoclimatic reconstruction or soil science...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims Improving crops {{requires}} better linking {{of traits}} and metabolic processes to whole plantperformance. In this paper, we present CN-Wheat, a comprehensive and mechanistic model of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism within wheat culms after anthesis. Methods The culm {{is described by}} modules that represent the roots, photosynthetic organs and grains. Each of them includes structural, storage and mobile materials. Fluxes of C and N among modules occur through a common pool and through <b>transpiration</b> <b>flow.</b> Metabolite variations are represented by differential equations that depend on the physiological processes occurring in each module. A challenging aspect of CN-Wheat lies in the regulation of these processes by metabolite concentrations and the environment perceived by organs. Key Results CN-Wheat simulates the distribution of C and N into wheat culms in relation to photosynthesis, N uptake, metabolite turnover, root exudation and tissue death. Regulation of physiological activities by local concentrationsof metabolites {{appears to be a}} valuable feature for understanding how the behaviour of the whole plant canemerge from local rules. Conclusions The originality of CN-Wheat is that it proposes an integrated view of plant functioning based on a mechanistic approach. The formalization of each process can be further refined in the future as knowledge progresses. This approach is expected to strengthen our capacity to understand plant responses to their environment and investigate plant traits adapted to changes in agronomical practices or environmental conditions. A companion paper will evaluate the model...|$|E

40|$|International {{audience}} Field measurements from February 2003 to January 2004 in a humid (but dry in summer) crest heath wood-land (degraded laurel forest) in the National Park of Garajonay, Canary Islands (Spain), {{were combined}} to calculate water balance components. The water balance domain {{is at the}} surface of the catchment and is controlled by atmospheric processes and vegetation.

40|$|Abstract. Salinisation of {{the soil}} can cause plant water deficits, ion and {{nutrient}} imbalances and toxic reactions. The halophyte, Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh., is a mangrove that tolerates {{a wide range of}} soil salinities. In order to understand how salinity affects plant growth and functioning and how salinity responses are influenced by the water deficit signalling hormone abscisic acid (ABA) we grew A. marina seedlings under two non-growth limiting salinities: 60 % seawater and 90 % seawater and with and without exogenously supplied ABA. We measured growth, photosynthesis, sap flow, aquaporin gene expression, hydraulic anatomy and nutrient status as well as sap ABA concentrations. ABA addition resulted in a drought phenotype (reduced sap <b>flow,</b> <b>transpiration</b> rates and photosynthesis and increasedwater use efficiency and aquaporin expression). In contrast, growth in high salinity did not lead to responses that are typical for water deficits, but rather, could be characterised as drought avoidance strategies (no reduction in sap <b>flow,</b> <b>transpiration</b> rates and photosynthesis and reduced aquaporin expression). Tissue nutrient concentrations were higher in seedlings grown at high salinities. We did not find evidence for a role for ABA in the mangrove salinity response, suggesting ABA is not produced directly in response to high concentrations of NaCl ions...|$|R
