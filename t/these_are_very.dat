5|$|No seed is set when pollinators are excluded, {{indicating}} that seed set must be pollinator-limited. About 96% of fertilized follicles mature, and about 82% of seeds mature. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> high numbers for Banksia, {{indicating that}} there are no problems with nutrient supply. This species produces an unusually high number of old flowerheads, or cones, per plant—typically more than 500. However, there are an unusually low number of follicles per cone—often only one. Thus the number of follicles per plant ends up roughly average for a Banksia species.|$|E

25|$|Driveway Entrances: <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> bad, as {{most have}} {{insufficient}} radii with guardrail placed {{too close to}} the edge of the pavement. Many entrances do not have right turn lanes, lighting, appropriate width, or a sufficient clear-zone.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these large indentations, {{there are a number}} of tombolos connecting peninsulas to the island. Many of <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> fragile, and can be damaged extremely easily by human erosion, or severe storms, creating new islands - or resurrecting old ones.|$|E

25|$|Rheumatologists treat arthritis, {{autoimmune}} diseases, pain disorders affecting joints, and osteoporosis. There {{are more}} than 200 types of these diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout, lupus, back pain, osteoporosis, and tendinitis.

25|$|In general, {{political}} {{figures in the}} ancient Near East liked {{to take credit for}} public works. Temples, buildings and statues built by a ruler are likely {{to have some sort of}} inscription mentioning his name. The kings also were sure to record major deeds like battles won, titles acquired, or gods appeased in some form of public inscription. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> useful in tracking the reign of a ruler.|$|E
25|$|If any {{of these}} {{symptoms}} are observed, veterinary advice should be sought. The veterinarian will usually auscultate (listen to the horse's chest with a stethoscope) to attempt to detect adventitious lung sounds. If <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> quiet, a rebreathing bag may be used - a plastic bag over the nose to intensify the horse's respiratory effort and hence the sounds. This procedure can be dangerous {{and should not be}} attempted by non-professionals.|$|E

25|$|Periungual fibromas: Also {{known as}} Koenen's tumors, these are small fleshy tumors that grow around {{and under the}} toenails or fingernails and {{may need to be}} surgically removed if they enlarge or cause bleeding. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> rare in childhood, but common by middle age. They are {{generally}} more common on toes than on ﬁngers, develop at 15–29 years, and are more common in women than in men. They can be induced by nail-bed trauma.|$|E
25|$|The LA-8 has {{its origin}} with the Chaika L-6, first flown in 2000, and its {{immediate}} successor the L-6M, promoted by AeroVolga and first flown in 2001. Both {{of these were}} twin engine, V-tailed amphibious aircraft, the latter differing in its hull design, undercarriage and maximum take-off weight. Chaika developed the L-6M into the L-4 and AeroVolga developed it into the LA-8. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> different designs: the LA-8 has a T-tail and is some 25% longer than the L-4, with tricycle gear.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{many other}} paravians, {{the feet of}} Anchiornis (except for the claws) were {{completely}} covered in feathers, though these were much shorter than the ones making up the hindwing. Some specimens have preserved scales on the toes, tarsus, and even lower leg (tibia), suggesting that scales existed beneath the feathers. The underside of the toes were formed into fleshy pads with distinct creases at the joints. The foot pads were covered in small, pebble-like scales. Scales were also present {{on the top of}} the feet but <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> hard to see in all known fossils.|$|E
50|$|A model {{appearing}} in 1984 was the Katana 750SE with a pop-up headlight, still using an air-oil cooled engine. <b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> popular {{even when their}} performance was easily out done by other competitors at the time.|$|R

25|$|Compressed air foam system (CAFS): The CAFS {{extinguisher}} (example: TRI-MAX Mini-CAF) {{differs from}} a standard stored-pressure premix foam extinguisher {{in that it}} operates at a higher pressure of 140 psi, aerates the foam with an attached compressed gas cylinder instead of an air-aspirating nozzle, and uses a drier foam solution with a higher concentrate to water ratio. Generally used to extend a water supply in wildland operations. Used on class A fires and with very dry foam on class B for vapor suppression. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> expensive, special purpose extinguishers typically used by fire departments or other safety professionals.|$|E
25|$|The rhetorical {{question}} mark or percontation point {{was invented by}} Henry Denham in the 1580s and was used {{at the end of}} a {{rhetorical question}}; however, its use died out in the 17th century. It was later revived in modern-day society by Matt DiRoberto. It was the reverse of an ordinary question mark, so that instead of the main opening pointing back into the sentence, it opened away from it. This character can be represented using the reversed question mark (⸮) found in Unicode as U+2E2E. The percontation point is analogous to the Irony mark, but <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> rarely seen.|$|E
25|$|The carpet is {{produced}} on a loom {{quite similar to}} woven fabric. The pile can be plush or Berber. Plush carpet is a cut pile and Berber carpet is a loop pile. There are new styles of carpet combining the two styles called cut and loop carpeting. Normally many colored yarns are used and this process is capable of producing intricate patterns from predetermined designs (although some limitations apply to certain weaving methods with regard to accuracy of pattern within the carpet). These carpets are usually the most expensive due to the relatively slow speed of the manufacturing process. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> famous in Iran, India, Pakistan and Arabia.|$|E

25|$|The {{focus of}} Sancerre winemakers is usually {{to express the}} pure fruit {{flavours}} of Sauvignon blanc and the natural terroir of the region with very little adjustments taking place during winemaking. Most Sancerre is produced without malolactic fermentation and little oak influences. However, since the late 20th century more producers have begun experimenting {{with some degree of}} oak fermentation or aging. While most of the wines in this area are produced dry, in exceptionally warm and ripe years (such as 1989) some producers have made a late harvest wine. However, <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> rare. And while Sancerre blanc is the most widely produced style, both Sancerre rouge and a dry rosé style wine are also produced with Pinot noir.|$|E
25|$|The epigraphic record includes: (1) {{inscriptions}} from Roman military diplomas, {{which were}} bronze certificates of Roman citizenship awarded to peregrini soldiers {{who completed the}} minimum 25 years' service in the auxilia: <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> useful as, if complete, they contain a precise date and the province in which the regiment was serving at the time (as well the name, origin and rank of the recipient). (2) tiles or bricks, used in building work on Roman forts, stamped with the regiment's name. These show the forts where a regiment may have been based, but are rarely datable. (3) votive stone altars or tablets, and tombstones. These can indicate the addressee's origin if they are found in provinces away from the regiment's base. A minority are datable.|$|E
25|$|In the Late Triassic, ichthyosaurs {{attained}} {{the peak}} of their diversity. They occupied many ecological niches. Some were apex predators, others were hunters of small prey. Several species perhaps specialised in suction feeding or were ram feeders; also durophagous forms are known. Towards {{the end of the}} Late Triassic, a decline of variability seems to have occurred. The giant species seemed to have disappeared {{at the end of the}} Norian. Rhaetian (latest Triassic) ichthyosaurs are known from England, and <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> similar to those of the Early Jurassic. A possible explanation is an increased competition by sharks, Teleostei, and the first Plesiosauria. Like the dinosaurs, the ichthyosaurs and their contemporaries, the plesiosaurs, survived the End-Triassic extinction event, and quickly diversified again to fill the vacant ecological niches of the early Jurassic.|$|E
