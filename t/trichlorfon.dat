50|$|The equine botfly {{presents}} seasonal difficulties to equestrian caretakers, as it lays eggs on {{the insides}} of horses' front legs, on the cannon bone and knees, and sometimes on the throat or nose, depending on the species. These eggs, which look like small, yellow drops of paint, must be carefully removed during the laying season (late summer and early fall) to prevent infestation in the horse. When a horse rubs its nose on its legs, the eggs are transferred to the mouth, {{and from there to}} the intestines, where the larvae grow and attach themselves to the stomach lining or the small intestine. The attachment of the larvae to the tissue produces a mild irritation which results in erosions and ulcerations at this site. Removal of the eggs (which adhere to the host's hair) is difficult, since the bone and tendons are directly under the skin on the cannon bones: eggs must be removed with a sharp knife (often a razor blade) or rough sand paper, and caught before they reach the ground. The larvae remain attached and develop for 10-12 months before they are passed out in the feces. Occasionally, horse owners report seeing the botfly larvae in horse manure. These larvae are cylindrical in shape and are reddish orange in color. In one to two months, adult botflies emerge from the developing larvae and the cycle repeats. Bots can be controlled with several types of dewormers, including dichlorvos, ivermectin, and <b>trichlorfon.</b>|$|E

Two concentrations of mixture of <b>trichlorfon</b> and SDS (0. 0001 g/L <b>trichlorfon</b> + 0. 5 g/L SDS, 0. 1 g/L <b>trichlorfon</b> + 0. 5 g/L SDS) and 0. 0001 g/L <b>trichlorfon,</b> 0. 1 g/L <b>trichlorfon,</b> 0. 5 g/L SDS and control, were incubated simultaneously with homogenate of liver and muscle, respectively, at 25 degrees C for 60 min. After incubation, the content of reduced-glutathione (GSH) and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in homogenate of liver were determined, and the activities of AChE in homogenate of muscle were also measured. Treatment with <b>trichlorfon</b> caused a significant concentration-dependent and time-related inhibition of AChE activity at all treatment concentrations and times since <b>trichlorfon</b> is a cholinesterase inhibitor. For the same <b>trichlorfon</b> treatment, an apparent decrease in GSH content was found in concentration of 0. 01, 0. 1, 1 g/L, whereas no significant alteration in antioxidant enzyme activity were found at all experiment concentrations and times, which might indicate that antioxidant enzymes have {{not involved in the}} metabolism of <b>trichlorfon.</b> The depletion of GSH might indicate that ROS could be involved in the toxic effects of <b>trichlorfon.</b> Exposure of SDS can inhibit activities of AChE, GST and CAT at concentrations of 0. 5 and/or I g/L, which could be due to the denaturing process of SDS to the enzymes. For the mixture exposure of <b>trichlorfon</b> and SDS, the effect of the mixture of 0. 0001 g/L <b>trichlorfon</b> and 0. 5 g/L SDS on inhibition of AChE shows synergistic other than simple additive of <b>trichlorfon</b> and SDS.

40|$|There {{is great}} {{interest}} {{beginning to be}} shown in conducting polymers, such as polypyrrole (PPy), {{for use in the}} area of drug delivery systems. The main aim of the project was to produce PPy containing antischistosomal compounds and to study their release under electrochemical control. Schistosomiasis is the second most prevalent typical disease in the world, affecting millions of people, the majority of whom are young children. Once affected, parasites live inside the body, causing several terrible symptomatic diseases, such as hepatic fibrosis, ascites and granuloma formation. Antischistosomal compounds investigated for incorporation were niclosamide, niclosamide ethanolamine salt (NES), praziquantel and <b>trichlorfon.</b> All these, apart from NES, were found be to electrochemically inactive in the potential window used to prepare PPy. The conducting polymer grown in the presence of niclosamide was found to have quite different topography to that electrodeposited in its absence, as indicated by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies, however, did not show any peaks associated with niclosamide. This, together with the very poor solubility of niclosamide in a range of electrolytes (e. g., aqueous Na 2 SO 4 (0. 1 mol dm- 3); tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate, TBABF 4 (0. 01 mol dm- 3) / acetonitrile; TBABF 4 (0. 01 mol dm- 3) / methanol) suggested that niclosamide was not a suitable candidate for incorporation into this conducting polymer. Nucleation and growth behaviour (chronoamperometry) showed that the presence of praziquantel and <b>trichlorfon</b> in the electrolyte did not,alter PPy formation. Light microscopy and SEM investigations showed that no changes in film topography occured when these two drugs were added to the electrolyte. PPy was found to be electrodeposited at the surface of reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) electrodes and did not penetrate far into the bulk of the material. Thicker films (7 – 11 μm) and slightly greater penetration was achieved by stepping the potential to + 800 mV vs. SCE for 15 min, rather than using potential cycling. Subsequent studies were focused on <b>trichlorfon</b> due to its solubility in aqueous systems and hence greater promise for use in delivery devices to be used in aquatic systems. The presence of <b>trichlorfon</b> in PPy was not evidenced from Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) investigations, although this was probably due to the low concentration of the compound, since it was detected by XPS. These studies showed that one <b>trichlorfon</b> molecule was incorporated for every 765 pyrrole units when RVC was used as the substrate, and for every 103 pyrrole units when ITO glass was used. The former substrate has a much larger surface area, however, and so more <b>trichlorfon</b> overall will be incorporated than for PPy on ITO. XPS also showed that one sulphate anion was detected for every 4. 6 to 6. 4 pyrrole units. <b>Trichlorfon</b> release from PPy was successfully followed by GCMS, where ca. twice as much <b>trichlorfon</b> was released when the PPy/trichlorfon/RVC electrode was held at - 300 mV vs. SCE compared to open circuit conditions (no applied potential). At - 400 mV vs. SCE, a similar amount of <b>trichlorfon</b> (6. 43 μmol) was released after just 60 min compared to that released at - 300 mV vs. SCE after 24 h (6. 93 μmol). When the potential was too negative (- 500 mV vs. SCE), a reduced amount of <b>trichlorfon</b> (4. 72 μmol) was released after 60 min compared to the film at - 400 mV vs. SCE (6. 43 μmol), although it was greater than that released at - 300 mV vs. SCE (2. 87 μmol) and with no applied potential (1. 09 μmol). Thus, <b>trichlorfon</b> was successfully incorporated into PPy and could be released in a controlled fashion by varying the potential. The PPy/trichlorfon/RVC system showed promise for the construction of delivery devices for controlled release of <b>trichlorfon,</b> potentially for use in vivo or in aquatic environments. The last part of the work used computational chemistry techniques to investigate growing conducting polymer chains. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to calculate the unpaired π-electron spin density distribution of oligopyrrole and oligothiophene radical cations using VWN, BLYP and B 3 LYP functionals. For the oligomers investigated, α,α'-linkages were maintained, which preserve conjugation and hence conductivity. Pendant monomer units, however, joined via α,β'-linkages along the linear chain, were also predicted. The frequency of these pendent groups was dependent on the functional used, with more accurate B 3 LYP calculations suggesting a higher frequency than those performed using VWN. The time required to perform DFT calculations on long-chain oligomers (ca. 10 monomer units) was still practicable using the high-level B 3 LYP functional owing to the use of parallel processing. Since the frequency of pendant monomer units along the chain was dependent on the functional used, calculations using the B 3 LYP functional are recommended over more rapid computations using the VWN functional.

Individuals varied in their relative sensitivity to the pesticide, with the decline in Ucrit after exposure varying from 1 to 41 %. The Ucrit of the Tcfn group did not recover completely after 96 h in clean water, remaining 9. 4 ± 3. 2 % below their own control performance. The decline in performance {{was associated with a}} significant increase in net cost of aerobic swimming, of + 28. 4 ± 6. 5 % at a sustained speed of 2 bodylengths s− 1, which translated into a significant decline in swimming efficiency (Eswim) of − 17. 6 ± 4. 0 % at that speed. Within the Tcfn group, individual Eswim was a strong positive determinant of individual Ucrit across all trials, and a strong negative determinant of individual% decline in Ucrit after pesticide exposure (P < 0. 001, linear mixed effect models). <b>Trichlorfon</b> had no effects on standard metabolic rate or active metabolic rate (AMR) but, nonetheless, individual Ucrit in all trials, and% decline in Ucrit after exposure, were strongly associated with individual AMR (positively and negatively, respectively, P < 0. 001).

The main {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine if paste formulations of pyrantel pamoate alone or combined with <b>trichlorfon,</b> given in single doses, were effective in reducing the fecal nematode egg output in horses under field conditions and suspected to be carrying benzimidazole-resistant populations of small strongyles...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2003 Taylor & Francis Ltd. The {{susceptibility}} of cocoons {{and adults}} of Glyptapanteles militaris (Walsh) were studied. One organophosphate insecticide (<b>trichlorfon),</b> one organochlorine insecticide (endosulfan), one pyrethroid (deltamethrin) and a commercial formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp.

One- and 6 -day-old cocoons were sprayed with the insecticide solutions {{by means of a}} Potter Tower and held for adult emergence. Adults were exposed to residues of insecticides inside plastic vials. The B. thuringiensis formulation had no harmful effect on the cocoons nor on the adults. <b>Trichlorfon</b> and endosulfan were highly toxic to all the tested stages. Deltamethrin was highly toxic to adults but relatively safe when applied on parasitoid cocoons.

Contraction was achieved with levamisole concentrations (10 - 8 - 10 - 3 M) on tracheal strips of adult sheep (> 1 year of age). Pretreatment with <b>trichlorfon</b> (10 - 7 M) -levamisole (10 - 7 M) decreased the pD 2 and E max of Ach when compared to levamisole pretreatment (p<= 0. 01).

Pretreatment with atropine (10 - 6 M) decreased the E max of levamisole (10 - 4 M) significantly (p< 0. 05). To conclude, levamisole acted mainly on the muscarinic receptors of the sheep trachea and this effect was partly inhibited by atropine.

40|$|<b>Trichlorfon</b> (TCF) {{is one of}} {{the most}} used {{veterinary}} pharmaceuticals not only to fight infestations but also as a preventive measure worldwide. The high concentrations used generate concerns about environmental and human health. In this work we assessed the acute toxicity of this compound to non-target organisms belonging to different trophic levels: Dania rerio (early life stages and adults). Daphnia magna and algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and (Morella vulgaris), and studied the potential of the biomarkers cholinesterase (ChE),glutathione-S-transferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and catalase (CAT) to assess sub-lethal effects of <b>trichlorfon</b> in zebrafish and daphnids. The fish embryo test followed the OECD draft guideline HT and was based on the exposure of newly fertilized eggs to 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 mg/L of TCF for 5 clays: the fish acute test followed the OECD guideline 203 and was based on the exposure of adult fish to 0, 2. 5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mg/L of TCF for 4 days; Daphnia sp. immobilization assay followed the OECD guideline 202 and was based on the exposure of juvenile daphnids to 0, 0. 1, 0. 3, 0. 5, 0. 7, 0. 9, 1 and 2 mu g/L of TCF for 2 days and the algae growth inhibition assay followed the OECD guideline 201 and was based on the exposure of the two species to 0, 1, 3. 2, 10, 32, 100 and 300 mg/L of TCF for 4 days. Biomarker levels were measured after 96 h exposure to TCF in zebrafish early life stages and adults and after 48 h exposure in D. magna. Tested organisms seem to have dissimilar sensitivities towards TCF exposure. D. magna (48 h-LC(50) = 0. 29 mu g/L) was the most sensitive organism, followed by early life stages and adults of zebrafish (96 h-LC(50) = 25. 4 and 28. 8 mg/L, respectively) and finally by the algae P. subcapitata (96 h-LC(50) = 274. 5 mg/L) and C. vulgaris (no effect observed). As daphnids are a source of food for organisms of higher trophic levels, the impairment on its population is prone to have consequences in the entire ecosystem. The biomarker activities measured in daphnids and fish seemed to be useful tools in the assessment of <b>trichlorfon</b> effects, especially ChE activity which was the most sensitive biomarker tested for all organisms. <b>Trichlorfon</b> was teratogenic for zebrafish embryos leading to anomalies in the absorption of the yolk sac, spine bending and pericardial oedemas. The present research suggests that further work is urgently needed in order to monitor environmental concentrations of <b>trichlorfon</b> and to test the long term effects of environmentally realistic concentrations of this compound.

40|$|International audienceOrganophosphate/carbamate target {{resistance}} {{has emerged}} in Culex pipiens L. (Diptera: Culicidae), the vector of Wuchereria bancrofti and West Nile virus (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) in China. The insensitive acetylcholinesterase was detected in only one of 20 samples collected on a north-to-south transect. According to previous Þndings, a unique mutation, G 119 S in the ace- 1 gene, explained this high insensitivity. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the mutation G 119 S recently detected in China results from an independent mutation event. The G 119 S mutation thus occurred {{at least three times}} independently within the Cx. pipiens complex, once in the temperate (Cx. p. pipiens) and twice in the tropical form (Cx. p. quinquefasciatus). Bioassays performed with a puriÞed G 119 S strain indicated that this substitution was associated with high levels of resistance to chlorpyrifos, fenitrothion, malathion, and parathion, but low levels of resistance to dichlorvos, <b>trichlorfon,</b> and fenthion. Hence, it is possible that in China, dichlorvos, <b>trichlorfon,</b> and fenthion will still achieve effective control even {{in the presence of the}} G 119 S mutation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Potentiometric {{electrodes}} {{based on}} the detection of choline esterase inhibition by analytes have been developed. The detection of choline esterase activity is {{based on the}} novel principle of molecular transduction. Immobilized peroxidase, acting as the molecular transducer, catalyzes the electroreduction of hydrogen peroxide by direct (mediatorless) electron transfer. The development of the following sensing elements are involved: screening different carbon-based electrode materials and modification of the electrode surface and testing of different types of enzyme immobilization. A number of different carbon-based materials were screened and tested: carbon fiber, felt and matt, graphite materials, and some highly dispersed carbon materials. A butyryl-choline sensitive, tri-enzyme electrode has been developed employing Teflonized carbon black as an electrode material of choice. The immobilization procedure is based on physical adsorption of peroxidase and co-immobilization of choline oxidase and choline esterase by the glutaraldehyde binding technique. Incubation of the electrode in a solution containing organophosphorus pesticide (<b>trichlorfon)</b> for 10 min results in a notable decrease of electrode activity. This allows for the determination of <b>trichlorfon</b> in nanomolar concentration with a detection limit of 1. 3 ppb...|$|E

An {{attempt was made to}} study morphological changes caused by some of these chemicals, by means of ultrastructural analysis, using a scanning electronic microscope. Carbaryl, fenitrothion, and methidathion caused 100 % adult mortality for both populations, avoiding evaluation of pesticides' effects on predator reproductive parameters. Abamectin and sulfur also affected the survival of these individuals with mortality rates of 10 % and 6. 7 %, respectively, for adults from Bento Gonçalves, and were harmless to those from Vacaria at the end of evaluation. <b>Trichlorfon</b> was also harmless to adults from both populations. No compound reduced oviposition capacity. C. externa from Vacaria presented higher reproductive potential than those from Bento Gonçalves. In relation to egg viability, sulfur was the most damaging compound to both populations of C. externa. Ultrastructural analyses showed morphological changes in the micropyle and the chorion of eggs laid by C. externa treated with either abamectin or sulfur. The treatment may have influenced the fertilization of C. externa eggs and embryonic development. Sulfur was responsible for malformations in the end region of the abdomen and genitals of treated females.

Os inseticidas estudados não foram seletivos em favor do predador P. sylveirae. Fenitrotiom, fenpropatrina, paratiom metílico e triclorfom não foram seletivos em favor dos predadores B. lecheguana e P. exigua. Abamectina, acefato e carbaril foram medianamente seletivos em favor de P. exigua, o mesmo foi verificado com abamectina e carbaril em favor de B. lecheguana. Acefato foi seletivo em favor de B. lecheguana e deltametrina em favor de P. exigua. As altas mortalidades causadas por deltametrina a P. sylveirae, triclorfom a B. lecheguana e acefato a P. exigua decresceram quando aplicados em subdose. B. lecheguana foi o predador mais tolerante à dose de acefato, seguido por P. exigua e P. sylveirae. O predador P. exigua foi mais tolerante à dose de deltametrina que B. lecheguana e P. sylveirae.

40|$|Abstract: Distribution {{and levels}} of {{octopamine}} (OA), one of the biogenic amines in the invertebrate nervous system, may have significant effects on insect physiological processes including growth, feeding and reproduction. In this paper capillary gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD) and mass selective detection (GC-MS) {{were used to determine}} the content of OA in Blattella germanica L. central nervous system (CNS), and that of OA in cockroach stressed by kinds of insecticides, known octopaminergic agonists and some essential oils. A derivatization method for organic extracts via reaction with pentafluoropropionic anhydride (PFPA) was developed. The resulting OA derivatives were confirmed by GC-MS to be tris-pentafluoropropionyl-OA. The method was used to quantify the amount of OA in insect issues by capillary GC-ECD through an extraction-derivatization-liquid/liquid partition procedure. Average OA content in normal cockroaches was determined to be 68. 49 ± 7. 31 ng/g tissue (N= 5 determinations). It was shown that insecticides including chlordimeform, methomyl, permethrin, chlorfluazuron, malathion, <b>trichlorfon</b> and some oxazolidine agonists, essential oils including eugenol, cinnamic alcohol, phenyl ethyl alcohol could led to significant increase of OA levels in the cockroach CNS comparing with which in insect treated by 1 -butanone.
