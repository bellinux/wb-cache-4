5|$|Anderton and Agatha go to Crow's {{hotel room}} as the 36-hour time nears, finding {{numerous}} photos of children, including Sean's. Crow arrives and Anderton prepares to kill him, accusing him of being a serial child killer. Agatha talks Anderton out of shooting Crow by telling him {{that he has the}} ability to choose his future now that he is aware of it. Crow however begs to be killed, having been hired <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> <b>the</b> photos and be killed in exchange for his family's financial well being. Crow grabs Anderton's gun and pushes the trigger, killing himself. Anderton and Agatha flee to Lara's house outside the city for refuge. There they learn Lively was Agatha's drug-addicted mother who sold her to PreCrime. Lively had sobered up and attempted to reclaim Agatha, but was murdered. Anderton realizes he is being targeted for knowing about Lively's existence and her connection to Agatha.|$|E
5|$|Authorities rapidly {{ruled out}} the {{possibility}} that ETA had a cell in the island, with police believing the attack had been carried out by a unit that had travelled to the island specifically to carry it out. Initial reports stated that the bombers had set the bomb off with a remote control. Once the second bomb was spotted, police announced that it had a timer device, which could have allowed the members of ETA <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> <b>the</b> bomb several days before the attack and leave the island. Earlier, Government delegate for Majorca, Ramon Soc√≠as, had said that security forces believed that the bombers had not left Majorca, and were hiding on the island, waiting for the situation to cool down before attempting to leave.|$|E
5|$|One day, while {{travelling}} {{around the}} city with his police officer-friend Balaji, Jagadish witnesses the explosion of a bus {{in which they had}} travelled. He manages to capture the man who laid the bomb, but he escapes from the hospital where he was kept under custody. Jagadish captures the bomber again, and also forces the police officer who helped the bomber's escape, to commit suicide. Jagadish soon learns that the bomber is a mere executor, a sleeper agent, whose only role was <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> <b>the</b> bomb. He also discovers that the Islamic terrorist group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, which the bomber belongs to, has planned various such attacks in the city in a couple of days. Enlisting the help of his fellow army men and Balaji, Jagadish manages to thwart these attacks and kill the sleeper cell leader's brother and eleven other terrorists, including the previously captured sleeper agent.|$|E

The gardens of the house were also created {{in line with the}} Arts and Crafts movement, {{providing}} food for the house. Influenced strongly by Margaret Bidulph, who had studied at Studley Horticultural College, where she had met her future head gardener William Scrubey. Scrubey and Margaret Biddulph would go on <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> <b>the</b> gardens together. The terrace and gardens south to the south of the house include yew hedges to create specific spaces, mixed with Portuguese laurels and roses, giving the impression of exterior rooms next to the house. Nearby is an area of topiary, clipped in domes and tiers. At {{the far end of the}} south terrace is a ha-ha, leading to a cherry orchard and tennis courts, although only one tennis court remains, the others have been converted in a croquet lawn and a swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|While {{preparing}} for his southern journey, Shackleton gave instructions to Edgeworth David {{to lead a}} Northern party to Victoria Land to carry out magnetic and geological work. The party {{was to try to}} reach the Magnetic Pole, and was to carry out a full geological survey in the Dry Valley area. David's party consisted of himself, Douglas Mawson and Alistair Mackay. It would be a man-hauling party; the dogs remained at base to be used for depot-laying and other routine work. The party had orders <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> <b>the</b> Union Jack at the Magnetic Pole and to take possession of Victoria Land for the British Empire. After several days' preparatory work, they started out on 5 October 1908, drawn for the first few miles by the motor car.|$|E
5|$|Former British {{soldier and}} writer Ken Wharton {{published}} {{in his book}} Wasted Years, Wasted Lives, Volume 1, an alternative theory that was suggested to him by loyalist paramilitarism researcher Jeanne Griffin; this was that the ambush was planned by Robin Jackson as an elaborate means of eliminating trumpet player Brian McCoy. Griffin suggests that McCoy, who originally came from Caledon, County Tyrone and had strong UDR and Orange Order family connections, was possibly approached at some stage by Jackson {{with a view of}} securing his help in carrying out UVF attacks in the Irish Republic. When McCoy refused, Jackson then hatched his plan to murder McCoy and his bandmates in retaliation, even macabrely choosing Buskhill as the ambush site due to its similarity to Bus-kill. Griffin goes on to add that the bogus checkpoint was set up not only <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> <b>the</b> bomb on board the van but to ensure the presence of McCoy which would have been confirmed when he handed over his driver's license to the gunmen. She also thinks that had everything gone to plan once the bomb was planted in the van McCoy would have been instructed to drive through Newry where the bomb would have gone off and the UVF could then afterwards portray the Miami Showband as IRA members on a mission to blow up the local RUC barracks. Griffin based her theory on the nine bullets that were fired from a Luger into McCoy's body and that Jackson's fingerprints were found on the silencer used for a Luger. She furthermore opined that Jackson was the man Travers saw kicking McCoy's body {{to make sure he was}} dead.|$|E

The prosecution relied heavily on the testimony of Harry Orchard, who claimed that the union had directed him <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> <b>the</b> bombs that killed supervisors and strikebreakers during the second Cripple Creek strike and that Haywood, Moyer and Pettibone had hired him to assassinate Governor Steunenberg.|$|E

25|$|While the Carthaginians and Phoenicians {{were the}} first to {{introduce}} viticulture to Spain, Rome's influential wine technology and the development of road networks brought new economic opportunities to the region, elevating grapes from a private agricultural crop to an important component of a viable commercial enterprise. Spanish wine was in Bordeaux before the region produced its own. French historian Roger Dion has suggested that the balisca vine (common in Spain's northern provinces, particularly Rioja) was brought from Rioja <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> <b>the</b> first Roman vineyards of Bordeaux.|$|E

Some of these influential techniques can be found in modern winemaking. These include the consideration of climate and landscape in deciding which grape varieties <b>to</b> <b>plant,</b> <b>the</b> benefits of different trellising and vine-training systems, the effects of pruning and harvest yields on the quality of wine, as well as winemaking techniques such as sur lie aging after fermentation and the maintenance of sanitary practices throughout the winemaking process to avoid contamination, impurities and spoilage.|$|E

25|$|Turner Creek Park opened about 1990 near W. L. Henry Elementary School and {{southwest}} 32nd Avenue {{in the center}} of Hillsboro. Construction included building dams and trails along the creek, with some labor provided by an alternative school program paid for by the federal government. During construction the city received donation of nearly 100 trees from a local nursery and Portland General Electric, with volunteers providing the labor <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> <b>the</b> trees. During the summer of 1992 some trees at the park died due to a drought. The city sought to receive 75 live former Christmas trees in donations from local residents after Christmas in 1992 to plant at the park to replace those that died.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Reznov drags Dimitri {{out of the}} U-Bahn {{to regroup}} with Soviet infantry. The Red Army then {{advances}} towards the Reichstag. During the assault at the Reichstag's entrance, Chernov is severely burned by a flamethrower, and is implied to be killed. Reznov, Dimitri and the remaining Soviet soldiers enter the Reichstag, clear it of its German defenders, and reach the rooftop. After a final showdown {{on the top floor}} to reach the Nazi flag, Dimitri is shot by a dying German soldier in an attempt to stop him from planting the Soviet flag, whom Reznov kills with a machete. Although wounded, Dimitri manages <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> <b>the</b> Soviet flag, signaling Soviet victory and ending the war in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Monocultures and {{invasive}} species. In {{an effort}} to cut costs, some tree-planting projects introduce fast-growing invasive species that end up damaging native forests and reducing biodiversity. For example, in Ecuador, the Dutch FACE Foundation has an offset project in the Andean P√°ramo involving 220 square kilometres of eucalyptus and pine planted. The NGO Acci√≥n Ecol√≥gica criticized the project for destroying a valuable P√°ramo ecosystem by introducing exotic tree species, causing the release of much soil carbon into the atmosphere, and harming local communities who had entered into contracts with the FACE Foundation <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> <b>the</b> trees. However, some certification standards, such as the Climate Community and Biodiversity Standard require multiple species plantings.|$|E

As a result, it is very important <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> at <b>the</b> private spaces. This study shows how landscape planting should be at the site of the enterprising offices based on the land use characteristics. In this study, first of all, the enterprising offices were divided into 3 types based on the difference of use districts. This study produced the following findings: 1) The lack of space at the enterprising office disturbed landscape planting. 2) It was more useful to go on with the plan concerning landscape <b>planting</b> at <b>the</b> district scale. 3) It was very useful <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> near <b>the</b> entrance or around the site of the enterprising office situated at the industrial land use, and <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> near <b>the</b> entrance, around the site, or on the veranda of the enterprising office situated at the commercial land use.

25|$|Bob Markham (Mark Harmon) - A logger, widower, {{and single}} father to his {{daughter}} Abby. After his wife died, he sunk everything he had into logging. However, {{the way he was}} logging tore up so much soil, that a long dormant plague was released and threatened to kill his men, and daughter. With help from Tarzan and Terk, Markham gathered {{all but one of the}} ingredients for the cure. The last one was a flower that was only found in one part of the jungle, until Markham's men bulldozed over them while logging. By some luck, Abby had picked one of them before, and Jane showed her how to press it, thus preserving it. After Abby and Markham's men were cured, they ceased logging and started <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> <b>the</b> seeds saved from the flower.|$|E
