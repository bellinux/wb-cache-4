5|$|A severe {{fire at the}} Grand Central {{station on}} April 21, 1964, {{destroyed}} the demonstration train and manual operation had been restored since. The fire began under a shuttle train on track 3, and it became larger, feeding on the wooden platform. The train on Track 1 was saved when the motorman saw smoke, and reversed the train. The basements of nearby buildings were damaged. Tracks 1 and 4 returned <b>to</b> <b>service</b> on April 23, 1964, while Track 3 returned <b>to</b> <b>service</b> on June 1, 1964.

Initially, a decision was not made concerning whether or not the automated shuttle train should be reintroduced.|$|E

40|$|Do {{services}} R&D {{and innovation}} matter? If so, what policy options are available <b>to</b> facilitate <b>services</b> R&D and innovation? This paper addresses these two questions. We discuss whether market (and systemic) failures apply <b>to</b> <b>services</b> and services R&D and innovation. The usual storyline to pay no specific attention <b>to</b> <b>services</b> in R&D and innovation policies is challenged. Three major approaches (assimilation, demarcation and systemic) <b>to</b> <b>services</b> R&D and innovation policy are discussed and practical policy options {{along these lines}} offered. It is concluded that the current debate on service innovation suffers from too much assimilation and demarcation thinking and lacks a vision as <b>to</b> how <b>services</b> are {{part and parcel of}} innovation systems. A systemic vision may emerge, providing a new analytical framework for developing new and more effective services R&D and innovation policies...|$|R
