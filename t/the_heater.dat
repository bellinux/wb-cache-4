5|$|Before take-off, D'Mario placed three cloth-covered foam {{cushions}} {{on top of}} {{a heating}} vent under the instructor navigator's seat in the aft section of the lower deck. Shortly after take-off, another cushion was placed under the seat. The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, which had to be conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his rest period. His seat was taken by the spare pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's rheostat was turned up, so D'Mario opened an engine bleed valve to draw additional hot air into <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> from the engine manifold. Because of a heater malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled from the engine manifold to the cabin's heating ducts. During the next half-hour, the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed cushions ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire. The navigator searched the lower compartment twice before discovering the fire behind a metal box. He attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers, but could not put it out.|$|E
25|$|For example, a {{temperature-controlled}} circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, {{each with}} its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> directly, the outer PID controller sets a heater temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> using a thermocouple attached to <b>the</b> <b>heater.</b> The inner controller's error term is the difference between this heater temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of <b>the</b> <b>heater.</b> Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this setpoint.|$|E
25|$|On many {{automobile}} engines, {{including all}} Chrysler Group and General Motors products, the thermostat does not restrict flow to <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> core. The passenger side tank of the radiator {{is used as}} a bypass to the thermostat, flowing through <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> core. This prevents formation of steam pockets before the thermostat opens, and allows <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> to function before the thermostat opens. Another benefit is that there is still some flow through the radiator if the thermostat fails.|$|E
30|$|The porous {{nanoparticle}} layer increases surface wettability, which directly {{affects the}} boiling phenomena, {{as will be}} discussed later. The static contact angle of <b>the</b> as-received <b>heater</b> was approximately 100 °, the contact angle of <b>the</b> <b>heaters</b> that were boiled in deionized water [DI] water ranged from 80 ° to 90 °, while the contact angle of <b>the</b> <b>heaters</b> boiled in nanofluids were significantly lower (6 ° to 16 °). There is a slight, but statistically significant, trend of <b>the</b> <b>heaters</b> boiled in silica nanofluids having a lower contact angle than those boiled in diamond nanofluids.|$|R
50|$|At 08:35 {{the backup}} circuit breaker {{controlling}} <b>the</b> primary <b>heaters</b> on <b>the</b> segment joints of both solid rocket boosters were noticed to have failed. Consideration {{was given to}} a repair on the pad. However, this was not done as <b>the</b> <b>heaters</b> are only used in colder weather, and <b>the</b> primary <b>heater</b> was functional.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>heater</b> and {{protection}} thermostats were originally {{designed for the}} Command Module's 28-volt DC bus. The specifications for <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> and thermostat were later changed to allow a 65-volt ground supply, in order to pressurize the tanks more rapidly. Beechcraft, the tank subcontractor, did not upgrade the thermostat to handle the higher voltage.|$|E

25|$|Tube heaters {{may also}} fail without warning, {{especially}} if exposed to over voltage or {{as a result}} of manufacturing defects. Tube heaters do not normally fail by evaporation like lamp filaments, since they operate at much lower temperature. The surge of inrush current when <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> is first energized causes stress in <b>the</b> <b>heater,</b> and can be avoided by slowly warming the heaters, gradually increasing current with a NTC thermistor included in the circuit. Tubes intended for series-string operation of the heaters across the supply have a specified controlled warm-up time to avoid excess voltage on some heaters as others warm up. Directly heated filament-type cathodes as used in battery-operated tubes or some rectifiers may fail if the filament sags, causing internal arcing. Excess heater-to-cathode voltage in indirectly heated cathodes can break down the insulation between elements and destroy <b>the</b> <b>heater.</b>|$|E

40|$|Thin nonisothermal {{liquid film}} flowing down under action oj gravity is considered. Investigation of the {{influence}} of the spanwise and streamwise arrangement of <b>the</b> rectangular <b>heaters</b> on 3 -D structures, occurring at the film surface, is the main objective of the present work. Three-dimensional time-dependant mathematical model for calculation of gas-liquid interface deformations and evolution of temperature fields was developed. Our numerical investigations have shown that interaction, imposition and mutual influence of the 3 D structures (bumps, lateral waves.) takes place. In the case of streamwise arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>heaters</b> film rupture is most likely on <b>the</b> second <b>heater.</b> There is a critical backlash between <b>the</b> <b>heaters,</b> at which film deformations, including film thinning, are the largest. For the spanwise arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>heaters</b> distance between them practically do not effect on the minimum film thickness, but mutual imposition of the lateral waves and film thickening exists. © Z-Tec Publishing.

50|$|In 1954, fire {{ripped through}} the Palestra and {{destroyed}} the ballroom. In 1964, the Iron Rangers hockey team received permission to heat the building with portable <b>heaters.</b> However, <b>the</b> fire marshal declared that <b>the</b> <b>heaters</b> {{could not be used}} when fans were in the building. Therefore, the building was warmed up and <b>the</b> <b>heaters</b> turned off before the doors opened for the day's game.|$|R
25|$|Cold {{weather had}} a {{significant}} impact on drivers in the New York and New Jersey areas, which suffered a particularly harsh winter during the study period. These drivers discovered an unacceptable drop in the vehicles' range when using <b>the</b> <b>heater.</b>|$|E
25|$|Within {{weeks of}} the 1971 models' debut, however, Buick—and all other GM dealers—received {{multiple}} complaints from drivers who complained the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> could warm up—and could not be shut off. The ventilation system was extensively revised for 1972.|$|E
25|$|The active {{medium of}} <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> {{depicted}} {{in this section}} is a coil of nichrome resistance wire inside a fused silica tube, open to the atmosphere at the ends, although models exist where the fused silica is sealed at the ends and the resistance alloy is not nichrome.|$|E
5000|$|Battery-operated {{radio sets}} used direct-current power for <b>the</b> <b>heaters</b> (commonly known as filaments), and tubes {{intended}} for battery sets {{were designed to}} use as little filament power as necessary, to economize on battery replacement. The final models of tube-equipped radio receivers were built with subminiature tubes using less than 50 mA for <b>the</b> <b>heaters,</b> but these types were developed {{at about the same}} time as transistors which replaced them.|$|R
5000|$|Apart from {{portable}} models {{which became}} available later, some {{system of support}} was necessary for the curlers. At first these were fixed to the ceiling, but these were soon replaced by a machine which was universally adopted. A vertical metal pipe held a circular unit, called a [...] "chandelier" [...] from which <b>the</b> <b>heaters</b> were suspended. <b>The</b> bottom of the pipe was mounted on a base with wheels which enabled the device to be moved easily between clients or {{to one side of}} the salon. The chandelier took some of the weight of <b>the</b> <b>heaters</b> and kept them tidy; it also facilitated the electrical connection, and the cables to <b>the</b> <b>heaters</b> also took some of the weight of the curlers.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes radomes may be {{unsightly}} if near <b>the</b> ground, and <b>heaters</b> {{could be}} used instead. Usually running on direct current, <b>the</b> <b>heaters</b> do not interfere physically or electrically with the alternating current of the radio transmission.|$|R
25|$|However, {{within weeks}} of the 1971 models' debut, Buick and all other GM dealers {{received}} multiple complaints from drivers who complained that the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> could warm up {{and could not be}} turned off. The ventilation system was extensively modified for 1972.|$|E
25|$|All {{thermodynamic}} cycles require large temperature differentials for efficient operation. In {{an external}} combustion engine, <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> temperature always equals or exceeds the expansion temperature. This {{means that the}} metallurgical requirements for <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> material are very demanding. This {{is similar to a}} Gas turbine, but is in contrast to an Otto engine or Diesel engine, where the expansion temperature can far exceed the metallurgical limit of the engine materials, because the input heat source is not conducted through the engine, so engine materials operate closer to the average temperature of the working gas. The Stirling cycle is not actually achievable, the real cycle in Stirling machines is less efficient than the theoretical Stirling cycle, also the efficiency of the Stirling cycle is lower where the ambient temperatures are mild, while it would give its best results in a cool environment, such as northern countries' winters.|$|E
25|$|Economically, {{electric}} heat can {{be compared}} to other sources of home heating by multiplying the local cost per kilowatt hour for electricity by the number of kilowatts <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> uses. E.g.: 1500-watt heater at 12 cents per kilowatt hour 1.5×12=18 cents per hour. When comparing to burning fuel it may be useful to convert kilowatt hours to BTUs: 1.5kWh × 3412.142=5118 BTU.|$|E
25|$|On August 10, 2008, Compass-1 entered Emergency mode.

25|$|The main {{store for}} bed linen on the Plymouth service was at Old Oak Common depot near London Paddington.

Instead, the dirty linen was stacked in plastic bags in the vestibule of W2437, against <b>the</b> <b>heater.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} was investigated {{and the following}} probable cause statement was issued:The aircraft sustained a hit or hits which caused loss of pressurization and a fire in <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> compartment.

25|$|The proportional, integral, and {{differential}} {{terms of}} the two controllers will be very different. The outer PID controller has a long time constant – all {{the water in the}} tank needs to heat up or cool down. The inner loop responds much more quickly. Each controller can be tuned to match the physics of the system it controls – heat transfer and thermal mass of the whole tank or of just <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> – giving better total response.|$|E

25|$|Some {{programmable}} thermostats {{are available}} to control line-voltage systems. Baseboard heaters will especially benefit from a programmable thermostat which is capable of continuous control (as are at least some Honeywell models), effectively controlling <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> like a lamp dimmer, and gradually increasing and decreasing heating to ensure an extremely constant room temperature (continuous control {{rather than relying on}} the averaging effects of hysteresis). Systems which include a fan (electric furnaces, wall heaters, etc.) must typically use simple on/off controls.|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on 7 September, El Mundo suggested that during the flight preparation and takeoff attempts, the aircraft had some of its systems in flight mode rather than ground mode. If true, this might explain why de-icing of the Total Air Temperature probe activated on the ground, causing overheating, since in flight <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> would activate only {{when there was no}} air flow in the probe, a sign of icing. This might also explain why the flaps and slats alarm had not sounded, since this alarm is disabled in flight mode.|$|E
25|$|The {{new body}} also {{featured}} a double shell roof for improved roll-over protection. Also new for '71 was a flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents {{mounted in the}} trunklid shared with other full-sized GM cars and the compact Chevrolet Vega. It used <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.|$|E
