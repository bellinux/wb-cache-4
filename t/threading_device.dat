50|$|An Abalakov thread can be {{constructed}} using an ice screw, 1 - 2 m of appropriate strength cord, and hook-like Abalakov <b>threading</b> <b>device.</b> Two holes are drilled in the ice, which interconnect at the ends to form a v-like channel in the ice. The cord is then threaded through this hole, and tied with a knot such as a fisherman's knot. This loop is then used to hang the abseiling rope. Abalakov thread can only {{be constructed}} in solid ice. The holes need to be drilled at the correct angle (about 45-50 degrees compared to ice surface), and {{care must be taken}} that they interconnect. The surfaces of the holes need to have sufficient distance (about 17 - 20 cm) between them. If the ice is not strong enough, it is possible to use two Abalakovs to balance the force, although if this is needed, an alternate route is strongly recommended.|$|E
40|$|International audienceEvaluating and {{improving}} product acceptability {{is an important}} step to minimize the risk of a new product not being accepted. Existing approaches do not integrate any acceptability evaluation during the New Product Development process (NPD). They do not make it possible to evaluate different improvement scenarios built from experts knowledge or past projects experiences. This paper proposes a method that evaluates and improves product acceptability by allowing the project manager to find out an improvement scenario. The proposed method is based on the evaluation of the users’ concept perception. It exploits the inference properties of Bayesian networks (BN) allowing to make useful estimations of improvement scenarios. Furthermore, those scenarios are composed of actions that enable to improve different dimensions of users’ acceptability. The modeled actions are stocked in a knowledge base allowing this knowledge to be reused in other projects. The method is applied to the design case of a medical-stocking <b>threading</b> <b>device</b> in order to illustrate its interest...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDeveloping {{products}} that are properly suited to users' needs and preferences {{in order to be}} accepted {{is one of the main}} challenges designers and engineers face constantly. Evaluating and improving users' product acceptability has become an important research question. Many approaches leave the acceptability evaluation question for the last phases of the New Product Development process (NPD), when an almost finished prototype is available and when there is no time left for important modifications. In the early phase of the NPD process, the project managers need models and methods to evaluate the potential acceptability of the new concept and if required, to define actions to improve this concept. In this paper, a method with two main goals is proposed to tackle this problem. Its first goal consists in evaluating an index of users' product acceptability. When this index is too low, the second goal concerns the optimal selection of the most appropriate actions (improvement scenario) to increase this previously assessed index and to optimise the supplementary cost. As information collected from users in the early phase is subject to uncertainty, the proposed method exploits the inference properties of Bayesian networks making it possible to make useful estimations of the acceptability index. Furthermore, the improvement scenarios are composed of actions that make it possible to improve different criteria composing the users' acceptability index. The improvement problem is formulated as an optimisation problem to be solved by a simulated annealing algorithm. In order to illustrate its interest, the proposed method is applied to a real case concerning the design of a medical-stocking <b>threading</b> <b>device...</b>|$|E

5000|$|A {{porthole}} {{consists of}} at least two structural components and is, in its simplest form, similar to any other type of window in design and purpose. The porthole is primarily a circular glass disk, known as a 'portlight', encased in a metal frame that is bolted securely into the side of a ship's hull. Sometimes the glass disk of a porthole is encased in a separate frame which is hinged onto the base frame {{so that it can be}} opened and closed. In addition, many portholes also have metal storm covers that can be securely fastened against the window when necessary. The main purpose of the storm cover is, as its name implies, to protect the window from heavy seas. It is also used to block light from entering lower berths when darkness is preferred. The storm cover is referred to as a deadlight in maritime parlance. Storm covers are also used on Navy and merchant marine ships to prevent interior light from escaping the ship's lower berths, and to provide protection from hostile fire. Hinged porthole windows and storm covers are accessible from inside the ship's hull, and are typically fastened to their closed positions by hand tightening several pivoting, <b>threaded</b> <b>devices,</b> commonly referred to as [...] "dogs."

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A monitored <b>thread</b> guiding <b>device</b> in a knitting machine, {{in which a}}t least one thread is guided under predetermined tension along a free thread transport zone, has unit(s) for supplying the thread along the zone and a unit for receiving and/or further guiding the tensioned thread. An optical sensor unit, for contact-free detection of thread in the transport zone, generates a control or regulation signal for the thread supply and/or receiving unit(s). The novel feature is that a device for causing sideways oscillation of the thread from its path is provided along the transport zone. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a corresponding monitored thread guiding process, in which controlled transverse oscillations are induced in the thread in the transport zone, optical detection of a consequent dynamic sensor signal is used to indicate an undamaged thread and lack of detection of such a signal is used to detect a broken thread, in which case operation of the knitting machine is halted. USE - For monitored guiding of thread in a knitting machine, especially a circular knitting machine. ADVANTAGE - Guiding of the threads is effectively monitored (especially as regards thread tension) while avoiding additional wear on the knitting machine side components (including the thread itself), so {{that the need for}} expensive and time-consuming maintenance operations is eliminated. Constant thread quality is ensured, especially so that threads of low (specifically non-optically resolvable) roughness are obtained. Yarn guiding within several thread guides can be individually monitored, so that a higher quality knitted product is obtained. The thread tension can be regulated in individual thread guides...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. The use of {{locking plate}} {{technology}} for anterior lumbar spinal fusion has increased {{stability of the}} vertebral fusion mass over traditional nonconstrained screw and plate systems. This case report outlines a complication due {{to the use of}} this construct. Case. A patient with a history of L 2 corpectomy and anterior spinal fusion presented with discitis at the L 4 / 5 level and underwent an anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) supplemented with a locking plate placed anterolaterally for stability. Fifteen months after the ALIF procedure, he returned with a hardware infection. He underwent debridement of the infection site and removal of hardware. Results. Once hardware was exposed, removal of the locking plate screws was only successful in one out of four screws using a reverse <b>thread</b> screw removal <b>device.</b> Three of the reverse <b>thread</b> screw removal <b>devices</b> broke in attempt to remove the subsequent screws. A metal cutting drill was then used to break hoop stresses associated with the locking device and the plate was removed. Conclusion. Anterior locking plates add significant stability to an anterior spinal fusion mass. However, removal of this hardware can be complicated by the inherent properties of the design with significant risk of major vascular injury...|$|R

Furthermore, we determined the effectiveness of the attending females by artificially manipulating their natural habitat, which is clearly connected to the cleaning behaviour by parental females. As such, we have uncovered an extraordinary new role of silk <b>threads</b> as <b>devices</b> for cleaning the nest space and/or eggs.
