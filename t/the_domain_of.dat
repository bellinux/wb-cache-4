40|$|<b>The</b> protein <b>domains</b> {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> dimerization and polymerization of tubulin have been determined using chemical cross-linking and limited proteolysis. The intra-dimer bond is formed by <b>the</b> N-terminal <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> alpha-tubulin and <b>the</b> C-terminal <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> beta-tubulin. Conversely, <b>the</b> inter-dimer bond along protofilaments is formed by <b>the</b> N-terminal <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> beta-tubulin (carrying <b>the</b> exchangeable GTP) and <b>the</b> C-terminal <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> alpha-tubulin. <b>The</b> <b>domains</b> <b>of</b> proteolytically cleaved tubulin remain tightly associated in solution. Apart from the monomer, tubulin shows {{three levels of}} assembly: the dimer, oligomer and polymer. Several oligomeric species can be visualized by electron microscopy of rotary shadowed phosphocellulose-tubulin, h. p. l. c. and non-denaturing gel electrophoresis.

Thanatos mocked Kratos for Ares' mistaken decision and eventually killed Deimos, but was killed in turn by an angered Kratos. The character was voiced by Arthur Burghardt in Ghost of Sparta.|$|E
5|$|The late 1930s saw the {{emergence}} of a new era of tolerance in the United States. National leaders hailed the Bill of Rights, particularly as it protected minorities, as the essence of democracy. The 1939 Supreme Court decision in Hague v.

Even conservative elements, such as the American Bar Association began to campaign for civil liberties, which were long considered to be <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> left-leaning organizations.

The Spanish offensive culminated in the Battle of Yagüecas against Cacique Mabodomoca. Agüeybaná II was shot and killed, ending the first recorded military action in Puerto Rico. After the failed rebellion, the Tainos were forced to give up their customs and traditions by order of a Royal decree, approved by King Ferdinand II, which required that they adopt and practice the values, religion and language of their conquerors.|$|E

If neither QE is in <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> the other, they must be interpreted independently. These assumptions explain the cases where the direct object of the main clause is not within <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> the embedded subject.
