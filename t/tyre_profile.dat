50|$|Generally {{the aim is}} for {{trains to}} run without flange contact, which also depends on the <b>tyre</b> <b>profile</b> of the wheels. Allowance {{has to be made}} for the {{different}} speeds of trains. Slower trains will tend to make flange contact with the inner rail on curves, while faster trains will tend to ride outwards and make contact with the outer rail. Either contact causes wear and tear and may lead to derailment. Many high-speed lines do not permit slower freight trains, particularly with heavier axle loads. In some cases, the impact is reduced by the use of flange lubrication.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that wheels are {{responsible}} for a significant amount of the total aerodynamic drag of passenger vehicles. Tyres, and mostly rims, {{have been the subject of}} research in the automotive industry for the past years, but their effect and interaction with each other and with the car exterior is still not completely understood. This paper focuses on the use of CFD to study the effects of tyre geometry (<b>tyre</b> <b>profile</b> and tyre tread) on road vehicle aerodynamics. Whenever possible, results of the numerical computations are compared with experiments. More than sixty configurations were simulated. These simulations combined different tyre profiles, treads, rim designs and spoke orientation on two car types: a sedan and a sports wagon. Two tyre geometries were obtained directly from the tyre manufacturer, while a third geometry was obtained from our database and represents a generic tyre which covers different profiles of a given tyre size. All geometries were deformed based on measured wind tunnel data under a defined load and rotating conditions of 100 kph. Results have shown that the main grooves consistently lead to a decrease of both drag and lift. The edge pattern however, did not show a clear trend for drag and lift with respect to the different configurations studied, although its influence was always more noticeable on the sports wagon. The larger profile of the generic tyre resulted in higher drag and lift values with relation to the tyres obtained from the manufacturer. For a given rim, a drag difference was observed between two tyre geometries with same profile but different tyre tread. These findings lead to the conclusion that <b>tyre</b> <b>profile,</b> as well as tyre pattern, are important to consider. These results were confirmed by wind tunnel tests. In conclusion, the work of aerodynamic optimization of rims cannot be separated from the tyre itself...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{investigated}} {{the motion of}} a single axle and pair of wheels {{by means of a}} model, paying particular attention to the action of the flanges and to their influence on the development of “hunting”. In justification of the use of a single axle, evidence is produced that, owing to the various clearances, the axles of a bogie are in fact largely free to follow their individual paths. The effects of unsprung mass, wear of tyres and rails, flange clearance, lateral stiffness of the track, and other variables were studied. It is shown from considerations of dynamical similarity that the speed at which oscillation of a given violence occurs varies approximately inversely as the square root of the unsprung mass, and that a reduction of this mass would therefore be beneficial. Possible changes in <b>tyre</b> <b>profile</b> are discussed. Introduction. The lateral oscillation of railway vehicles {{has been the subject of}} many investigations, but the influence on the motion of the impacts between the flanges and the rails does not seem to have been adequately studied.

50|$|This {{class was}} notorious {{for having the}} axleboxes run hot when {{travelling}} at high speed. This was initially encountered during delivery of the first locomotive, and subsequent deliveries were made by road. A later trial move of one Class 07 to Selhurst depot for <b>tyre</b> <b>profiling</b> also resulted in overheating axlebox problems and all subsequent moves of any distance, particularly those to BREL workshops, were made by road. This {{is in contrast to}} other shunter classes that would commonly have had their side-rods removed and traction motors isolated and would then form part of a train heading in the appropriate direction. Class 08s were commonly moved in this fashion at up to 35 mi/h km/h - overnight wagon-load trains being utilised if possible.|$|R
40|$|Competitive {{performance}} of an F 1 race car relies upon a well designed and highly developed aerodynamic system. In {{order to achieve}} this, total understanding of the downstream wake of exposed rotating wheels is essential. Components such as bargeboards and indeed much of the front wing are developed to provide pressure gradients and vortex structures to influence the wheel wake, ensuring high energy mass-flow to the sensitive {{leading edge of the}} underfloor and eventually the rear wing. Wind tunnel testing of model-scale deformable tyres has become a common occurrence in F 1 in recent years although there is a significant lack of available literature, academic or otherwise, as to their use. This work has studied in detail the aerodynamic consequences which occur from the varying sidewall bulge and contact patch region making use of several techniques. These include scanning rotating tyre profiles under load, static contact patch size measurements, five-hole pressure probe wake measurements, particle image velocimetry (PIV) and load-cell drag measurements. CFD simulations utilising two industrial codes have also been performed to support the experimental work. Coordinates representing tyre profiles under a range of on-track conditions are available for other researchers to use as a basis for CFD studies. The work presented here includes a full range of representative on-track axle heights which far exceed the more conservative range usually tested in an industrial setting for longevity reasons. The most sensitive parameters for aerodynamic testing of wheels have been identified. For development of a full car, in decreasing order of priority, the following must be correctly matched to the realistic scenario: axle height, yaw condition (without glycerol - often used to reduce friction at the expense of a compromised <b>tyre</b> <b>profile),</b> camber angle, detailed internals, high inflation pressure, through-hub flow rate and least significantly the rotation of the internal brake rotor. The study of through-hub flows revealed that the external aerodynamic effect of the brake scoop inlet varies significantly with the amount of internal restriction. The pumping effect of the brake rotor was measured to be negligible compared to the restrictive effect of its internal passages and that leads to an effect known as inlet spillage with a negative cooling drag trend, whereby the drag of the wheel assembly decreases with increased through-hub flow...|$|E

40|$|The {{foundation}} {{of this research}} work was laid by {{the vision of a}} tractor simulator where the users can generate their customized tractor model with the help of just a user-interface. The aim of this paper was to modify the attributes of the tractor simulation model. For the same reason, a modeling configurator was developed for the tractor model in python programming language with a user-friendly interface designed over Microsoft excel. This research work reports the effort in the development of modeling configurator for parameterizing a tractor model. The modeling configurator has been designed {{in such a way that}} the users can select their choices just from a drop down menu in the user-interface. The attributes that can be parameterized are maximum torque of the engine, maximum braking torque for the engine, number of forward and reverse gears. For tyre modeling, special attention was paid as the modeling configurator allowed users to select only from the standard tyres available, whose width and diameter are predefined. The mass and number of tyres can also be modified. At last, additional equipment that can be used in farming was also modeled as an assembly file. For additional equipment, only trailer has been covered within the scope of this research work whose mass is predefined. The modeling configurator was validated by selecting different options in the user-interface and then running the simulation file and noting down the differences. Some differences can be visualized like the number of tyres and attached trailer, while other differences can be seen with the help of plots like maximum torque of the engine, gear index, and <b>tyre</b> <b>profiles.</b> For the masses of the tyres, user can only feel the difference while running the simulator in real-time. At the end of the research, scope for future work is also suggested based on the limitations of this research work...|$|R

40|$|This thesis reports an {{investigation}} into the relationships between the tyre strain feature and tyre operating conditions based on finite element analysis and experiments {{for the development of a}} strain-based intelligent tyre system, which could estimate the tyre operating characteristics for optimising vehicle dynamics control and improving vehicle safety. A 175 / 505 R 13 tyre is adopted as the subject of this study. An efficient and effective material property determination procedure is developed for investigating the rubber and reinforcement material properties by experiment. Considering the possibility of the absence of <b>tyre</b> composite <b>profile</b> due to proprietary protection by tyre manufacturer, a novel imagebased method is developed to capture the tyre geometry feature from the tyre product cut cross-section. Both the 2 D and 3 D finite element tyre models are created in the commercial finite element code ABAQUS. The generated finite element tyre models are validated with experimental data and then adopted to construct the comprehensive relationship between tyre strain feature and tyre operating characteristics. Experimental validation of these estimation models are implemented based on a custom designed test system. Finally, some recommendations are presented for improving the capability of the finite element tyre model and the strain-based intelligent tyre test system.

A vertical distance data from two roads, approximately 0. 8 km of new federal road and 5 km of state road were obtained. The International Roughness Index (1 RI) was used to classfi types of road based on the IRI classification. The IRI for each sample of road profile was computed using software named ProVal and FOOTWORKs. Road profile generating process was followed the theory Dodds and Robson and also Hardy and Cebon. The process was performed using MATLAB software. After generating road profiles, the calibration between reference and generated road profiles was performed by calculating the corelation coeffrcient value. The correlation coefficient value ranges between - 0. 7 to -l and 0. 7 to I is considered to have a similarity each other. As a results, for federal and state road, several models of road profiles were generated for each sample data. In conclusion, all the road profiles generated will be able to be used as an ahernative road profile in long term pavement performance analysis...|$|R

40|$|Both tyre {{wear and}} road {{polishing}} are complex phenomenon, which are obviously strongly related; {{the energy that}} polishes the road is the energy that wears the tyre. The both depend non-linearly on numerous parameters, like materials used, vehicle and road usage, environmental conditions (i. e. temperature) and many others. Based on these observations, in 2000 we started the three-year 5 th framework EU project TROWS (Tyre and ROad Wear and Slip assessment). This paper focuses on the followed approach, methods, tools and results of the TROWS project. Experiments have been performed on three different levels; compound tests, carousel tests and vehicle-on-the-road testing. A software environment has been developed that implements the different process steps, and that manages the data flow between these steps. These processes combine the various measurement datasets and the numerical tools developed by the different TROWS partners; one implementation allows to predict tyre global wear and the transversal <b>tyre</b> wear <b>profile,</b> the other implementation allows to predict asphalt polishing. The car tyre wear results and asphalt polishing results obtained from the measurements on the public road track in Italy agree well with the results determined with the tyre wear and road polishing prediction environments, both qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The tools developed allow tyre manufacturers to include tyre wear more easily in the early development steps of a new tyre, and help road management with the choice of which technique to use and in setting up effective road maintenance schemes...|$|R

5000|$|The fifth {{generation}} has received generally positive reviews. Nevertheless, {{some critics have}} complained that the car {{lost some of its}} distinctive European character with the redesign. Most reviewers found the ride to be firm and well controlled, but not always as forgiving as the previous generation. Handling was a strong point, with quick and precise steering and minimal body roll. Fit and finish received excellent marks, with reviewers noting the car felt very upscale. The front seats were firm but well liked, and the rear seat was roomy, in contrast to the cramped quarters in the fourth generation. Controls and displays were generally good. Reviewers were particularly impressed with the [...] "Sportline" [...] models (known as the GLI in North America). Equipped with sport seats, a firmer suspension lowered by 15 mm, and low <b>profile</b> <b>tyres,</b> critics praised the excellent handling that was an improvement over the already good performance on the standard model. Additionally, the 2.0 Turbo FSI engine also won commendation for its high power figures, smooth operation, and low fuel consumption.
