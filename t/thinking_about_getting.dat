On 27 June, during the first episode of the fifteenth series, it was revealed to be the Kia Cee'd and, as with the Chevrolet Lacetti, another open day was held to welcome the new car. Nick Robinson, Peter Jones, Al Murray, Bill Bailey, Peta Todd, Louie Spence and Amy Williams were among the initial drivers. Clarkson commonly refers to the Kia phonetically as the [...] "Cee-apostrophe-d".

2500|$|As a child, Murray's {{family lived}} in poverty and were {{constantly}} moving to different areas of London, which meant that he was often bullied and involved in fights. By the time his family settled in Clapton in 1970, Murray joined a skinhead gang and [...] "had a violent {{couple of years of}} being out on the street." [...] He developed an interest in rock music when he was 15 after hearing [...] "Voodoo Chile" [...] by Jimi Hendrix on the radio, about which he recalls, [...] "everything changed, just like that. Getting into rock music wasn't like a gradual process for me; it was completely sort of extreme, totally black and white. I heard 'Voodoo Chile' on the radio and I thought, 'Bloody hell! What is THAT? How do you do THAT?' And I started hanging around the rock music section of the record stores and buying albums, <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> into the big time, wondering what that would be like." [...] After [...] "hanging 'round record stores" [...] and acquiring several Hendrix and blues albums, Murray decided to take up the guitar. At 16, he formed his first band, a trio called Stone Free, which also included Adrian Smith on vocals, who would also become a member of Iron Maiden in 1980. From there, Murray would answer ads in Melody Maker and regularly audition for different bands at the weekend, leading to short stints in Electric Gas, [...] "this sort of soft-rock, American-type band," [...] and The Secret, [...] "this sort of mad punk band," [...] with whom he would record a single, [...] "Café De Dance", in 1975.|$|E

When a lady who is <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> married is asked by a gentleman who is frequently in her thoughts whether she does not want some one to love, it is natural that she should presume that he means to be particular; and it is natural also that she should be in some sort gratified by that particularity. Miss Mackenzie was, I think, gratified, but she did not express any such feeling.|$|E

Early in the series, Sandy decides to introduce Blinky and Pinky to her grandmother, but decides to keep them a secret to everyone else.|$|R

60|$|Charteris {{had no such}} scruples. The {{feeling of}} fatigue that had been upon him had vanished, and his temper, which had been growing {{steadily}} worse for some twenty minutes, now boiled over gleefully {{at the prospect of}} something solid to work itself off upon. Even without a cause Charteris detested the Rural Hooligan. Now that a real, copper-bottomed motive for this dislike had been supplied to him, he felt himself capable of dealing with a whole regiment of the breed. The criminal with the bicycle had just let it fall with a crash to the ground when Charteris went for him low, in the style which the Babe always insisted on seeing in members of the First Fifteen on the football field, and hove him without comment into a damp ditch. 'Charles his friend' uttered a shout of disapproval and rushed into the fray. Charteris gave him the straight left, of the type to which the great John Jackson is reported to have owed so much {{in the days of the}} old Prize Ring, and Charles, taking it between the eyes, stopped in a discouraged and discontented manner, and began to rub the place. Whereupon Charteris dashed in, and, to use an expression suitable to the deed, 'swung his right at the mark'. The 'mark', it may be explained for the benefit of the non-pugilistic, is that portion of the anatomy which lies hid behind the third button of the human waistcoat. It covers--in a most inadequate way--the wind, and even a gentle tap in the locality is apt to produce a fleeting sense of discomfort. A genuine flush hit on the spot, shrewdly administered by a muscular arm with the weight of the body behind it, causes the passive agent in the transaction to wish fervently, as far as he is at the moment physically capable of wishing anything, that he had never been born. 'Charles his friend' collapsed like an empty sack, and Charteris, getting a grip of the outlying portions of his costume, dragged him to the ditch and rolled him in on top of his friend, who had just recovered sufficiently to be <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> out again. The pair of them lay there in a tangled heap. Charteris picked up the bicycle and gave it a cursory examination. The enamel was a good deal scratched, but no material damage had been done. He wheeled it across to its owner.|$|E

40|$|For some, the transnationalization of {{political}} action and communicative {{space in the}} European Union heralds an emergent cosmopolitan order. Need that be so? There are supranational institutions in the EU as well as transnational political and cultural spaces and cross-border communicative flows. However, the Union's member states remain key controllers of citizenship rights and purveyors of collective identities. And for many purposes they still maintain strongly bounded national public spheres. Because the EU's overall character as a polity remains unresolved, this has consequences for the organization of communicative spaces. The EU is a field of tensions and contradictions that is inescapably rooted in institutional realities.

It differs from other books because it deals with a complex domain in a reflective rather than a descriptive way, and it organises the approach to information management in six stages, from simple consideration of information technology right through to issues of organisational strategy.

40|$|For most of us, <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> {{gender and}} {{management}} immediately {{brings to mind}} what are commonly thought of as “women’s issues”: sexual harassment, sex discrimination, work–family policies and, of course, the glass ceiling.

What kinds of problems, why, and what might be done to address them, {{has been the subject}} of much debate among scholars and practitioners alike. In this book, we use these debates as a way to explore conven-tional scholarly wisdom on the role of gender at work and for explicating an alter-native point of view – one that a number of us at the Center for Gender in Organizations have been developing in collaboration with others for the past 10 years. 1 From this point of view, we move away from the notion of gender as pri-marily a women’s issue and instead see gender as a central organizing feature of social life, with implications for women, men, and how we get work done. In particular, we find it useful to conceptualize gender as having two interrelated parts (Ely, 1999). There is an individual component, called gender identity, whic...|$|R
