40|$|We {{advocate}} {{the use of}} quantitative methods in Software Engineering where, traditionally, qualitative based approaches have still dominating, {{with the objective of}} expressing, assessing and improving software quality. We formalize a set of software complexity metrics named Mood (Metrics for Object Oriented Design). These are evaluated theoretically and we use them as explicative variables of quality characteristics such as reliability or maintainability. To facilitate experimentation we conceived a textual language named Goodly (a Generic Object Oriented Design Language? Yes), which is used as intermediate formalism in the MOODKIT tool. We propose solutions to assess and optimize modularization according to structural criteria (cohesion and coupling among classes). We verify experimentally, using Motto (Modularity <b>Trial</b> <b>Tool</b> for Object oriented systems), that systems produced in several application domains are far from coping with the desiderata of structural modularization proclaimed in the literature. We prove the practicability of quantitative analysis applied to software systems built according to the object oriented paradigm. Several techniques from Applied Statistics, such as Multivariate Estimation, Cluster Analysis and adherence and independence tests are applied. These techniques, although common in others areas of Engineering, Economics (e. g.

40|$|The {{machine tool}} {{industry}} is highly dependent on the tooling which is needed to machine the components {{used to make the}} range of products seen in today's society. The range of tooling available to machinists is prolific and subject to continual growth. Those engineers faced with the task of process planning require advanced systems to support the decisions that need to be made for the production process to operate smoothly. The tooling data made available by these systems is a key factor in defining the efficiency with which the production processes can be carried out. This research examines the technical decision support systems made available to industrialists and highlights the scope to provide tooling engineers with up-to-date tooling performance and use data that can be used both in the planning stages as well as dealing with problems encountered during production. Specifically, this research identifies the role performed by widespread <b>tool</b> <b>trials,</b> associated with new tools or new materials, and goes on to show how the information obtained from <b>tool</b> <b>trials</b> can be collated in a structured manner and used to enhance the provision of data with which to carry out the process planning task. The goal of this research was to develop and implement a framework capable of collecting and disseminating data related to <b>tool</b> <b>trials</b> in a coherent and supportive fashion using distributed methods. This target resulted in the deployment of a system named JadeT, which is capable of receiving and analysing data from <b>tool</b> <b>trials</b> and subsequently enhancing the process planning task by basing cutting parameter selection on a combination of fundamental cutting parameter algorithms in parallel with using the approved data generated from <b>tool</b> <b>trials.</b> The JadeT system was tested via the creation of a database using actual <b>tool</b> <b>trial</b> reports, {{and the manner in which}} this data was used to provide cutting parameters was analysed.

40|$|Purpose A dearth in {{pediatric}} {{drug development}} often leaves pediatricians with {{no alternative but}} to prescribe unlicensed or off-label drugs with a resultant increased risk of adverse events. We present the current status of pediatric drug development and, based on our data analysis, clarify the problems in this area. Further action is proposed to improve the drug development that has pediatric therapeutic orphan status. Methods We analyzed all Phase II/III and Phase III trials in ClinicalTrials. gov that only included pediatric participants (15 % after 2008. Implications Recruitment and ethical obstacles make conducting pediatric clinical trials challenging. An improved operational framework for conducting clinical trials should mirror the ever-improving regulatory framework that incentivizes investment in pediatric clinical trials. Technological approaches, enhancements in electronic medical record systems, and community approaches that actively incorporate input from physicians, researchers, and patients could offer a sustainable solution to recruitment of pediatric study participants. The key therefore is to improve pediatric pharmacotherapy collaboration among industry, government, academia, and community. Expanding the regulatory steps taken in the European Union, United States, and Japan and using innovative clinical <b>trial</b> <b>tools</b> can move pediatric pharmacotherapy out of its current therapeutic orphan state.

40|$|In model-driven {{development}} of safety-critical systems (like automotive, avionics or railways), well- formedness of models is repeatedly validated {{in order to}} detect design flaws as early as possible. In many indus- <b>trial</b> <b>tools,</b> validation rules are still often implemented by {{a large amount of}} imperative model traversal code which makes those rule implementations complicated and hard to maintain. Additionally, as models are rapidly increas- ing in size and complexity, efficient execution of validation rules is challenging for the currently available tools. Checking well-formedness constraints can be captured by declarative queries over graph models, while model update operations can be specified as model transformations. This paper presents a benchmark for systematically assessing the scalability of validating and revalidating well-formedness constraints over large graph models. The benchmark defines well-formedness validation scenarios in the railway domain: a metamodel, an instance model generator and a set of well- formedness constraints captured by queries, fault injection and repair operations (imitating the work of systems engi- neers by model transformations). The benchmark focuses on the performance of query evaluation, i. e. its execution time and memory consumption, with a particular empha- sis on reevaluation. We demonstrate that the benchmark can be adopted to various technologies and query engines, including modeling tools; relational, graph and semantic databases.

40|$|Australian {{governments have}} set an ambitious policy agenda for reform. By 2010, water plans {{were to have}} {{provided}} {{for the return of}} all overallocated or overused systems to environmentally sustainable levels of extraction, however, many communities do not yet have full confidence in water plans or their processes. In two national research projects we developed practical tools for transparent and engaging processes to build confidence in water planning. We observe that inherent politicised risks in water planning mean that current methods of public participation, such as information giving and allowing written submissions, are 'safer' and more easily managed. The next article in this special issue sets out the methodology including performance indicators for the tools that we used in the research. To demonstrate their role in building community confidence using best available science we <b>trialled</b> <b>tools</b> which included agent-based participatory modelling, deliberative multi-criteria evaluation, social impact assessment, and groundwater visualisation models. The suite of 'good-practice' tools, including Indigenous engagement, is fully described in the following articles of this special issue.

Interactive tools and those which have high visual impact are consistently rated highly by all sectors of the community, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and also by water planners.

The aim of this project is to research engagement strategies (i. e. the participatory tools and approaches used by NRM institutions and practitioners) {{in partnership with the}} SEQWC regional body, in order to improve engagement practice in the region. The research approach consists of: (i) understanding current NRM engagement practices; (ii) motivations and preferences for NRM engagement; and (iii) <b>trialing</b> <b>tools</b> for NRM engagement.

Three key learnings: (1) engagement could be improved by training for practitioners to enhance their current engagement practice e. g. the inclusion of a monitoring and evaluation component of engagement activities invites greater practitioner reflection and capacity-building; (2) there is the opportunity to transfer knowledge amongst practitioners and the potential for greater coordination of engagement activities; and (3) the research is relevant to many NRM regions where peri-urban development is rapidly changing the landscape so there is an opportunity to extend and develop these findings to improve engagement in these transitional regions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background It {{has proven}} {{difficult}} to reach World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations that infants be exclusively breastfed from birth to six months of age 1 2, yet there is limited knowledge about interventions that are effective in increasing breastfeeding initiation and duration. Particularly lacking is evidence about how to maintain breastfeeding rates in countries which already have a high initiation of breastfeeding. This study aims to determine whether mid-pregnancy breastfeeding education, {{with a focus on}} either attitudes to breastfeeding or on technical aspects of breastfeeding, has an effect on rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration. Secondary aims of the study are to: explore what factors might affect the duration of breastfeeding and evaluate the interventions from the participant and childbirth facilitator perspectives. Methods/Design A randomised controlled trial (RCT) design will be used. Women having their first baby, and planning to give birth as public patients at the Royal Women's Hospital (RWH), Melbourne, will be approached at 18 – 20 weeks of pregnancy and {{invited to participate in the}} study. Participants will be randomly allocated to a control group or one of two group interventions: a previously designed and <b>trialled</b> <b>tool</b> to teach practical aspects of breastfeeding or an exploration of family attitudes to breastfeeding. The latter was developed and piloted by the investigators in conjunction with the group facilitators, prior to trial commencement. The interventions are planned to take place at 20 – 25 weeks.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Traumatic {{anterior}} shoulder instability (TASI) {{accounts for}} 95 % of glenohumeral dislocations and {{is associated with}} soft tissue and bony pathoanatomies. Non-operative treatments include slings, bracing and physiotherapy. Operative treatment is common, including bony and soft-tissue reconstructions performed through open or arthroscopic approaches. There is management variation in patient pathways for TASI including when to refer and when to operate. METHODS: A scoping review of systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, comparing operative with non-operative treatments and different operative treatments were the methods followed. Search was conducted for online bibliographic databases and reference lists of relevant articles from 2002 to 2012. Systematic reviews were appraised using AMSTAR (assessment of multiple systematic reviews) criteria. Controlled trials were appraised using the CONSORT (consolidation of standards of reporting <b>trials)</b> <b>tool.</b> RESULTS: Analysis of the reviews did not offer strong evidence for a best treatment option for TASI. No studies directly compare open, arthroscopic and structured rehabilitation programmes. Evaluation of arthroscopic studies and comparison to open procedures was difficult, {{as many of the}} arthroscopic techniques included are no longer used. Recurrence rate was generally considered the best measure of operative success, but was poorly documented throughout all studies. There was conflicting evidence on the optimal timing of intervention and no consensus on any scoring system or outcome measure. CONCLUSIONS: There is no agreement about which validated outcome tool should be used for assessing shoulder instability in patients. There is limited evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness of surgical and non-surgical treatment of TASI, including a lack of evidence regarding the optimal timing of such treatments. There is a need for a well-structured randomised control trial to assess the efficacy of surgical and non-surgical interventions for this common type of shoulder instability...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionThe {{residents}} of many Australian rural and remote communities {{do not have}} the essential infrastructure and services required to support healthy living conditions and community members choosing healthy lifestyle options. Improving these social determinants of health is seen to offer real opportunities to improve health among such disadvantaged populations. In this paper, we describe the development and <b>trialling</b> of a <b>tool</b> to measure, monitor and evaluate key social determinants of health at community level. MethodsThe tool was developed and piloted through a multi-phase and iterative process that involved a series of consultations with community members and key stakeholders and <b>trialling</b> the <b>tool</b> in remote Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory of Australia. ResultsThe indicators were found to be robust, and by testing the tool on a number of different levels, face validity was confirmed. The scoring system was well understood and easily followed by Indigenous and non-Indigenous study participants. A facilitated small group process was found to reduce bias in scoring of indicators. ConclusionThe Healthy Community Assessment Tool offers a useful vehicle and process to help those involved in planning, service provision and more generally promoting improvements in community social determinants of health. The tool offers many potential uses and benefits for those seeking to address inequities in the social determinants of health in remote communities.
