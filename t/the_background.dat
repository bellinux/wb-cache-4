5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In <b>the</b> <b>background,</b> Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with <b>the</b> <b>background</b> dark. Then <b>the</b> <b>background</b> was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with <b>the</b> <b>background</b> action.|$|E

5|$|Some animals {{mimic the}} optic flow of <b>the</b> <b>background,</b> {{so that the}} {{attacker}} {{does not appear to}} move when seen by the target. This is the main focus of work on motion camouflage, and is often treated as synonymous with it. An attacker can achieve this by choosing its flight path so as to remain on the line between the target and either some real landmark point, or a point at infinite distance (giving different pursuit algorithms). It therefore does not move from the landmark point as seen by the target, though it inevitably looms larger as it approaches. This {{is not the same as}} moving straight towards the target (classical pursuit): that results in visible sideways motion with a readily detectable difference in optic flow from <b>the</b> <b>background.</b> The strategy works whether <b>the</b> <b>background</b> is plain or textured.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} done in {{preparation}} of an analysis for future resonant τ-sneutrino searches with an electron and a muon in its final state in proton-proton collisions at the LHC at CERN with a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and a luminosity of 1 fb− 1. The underlying theory for this search is the theory of supersymmetry with R-parity violation. As <b>backgrounds,</b> <b>the</b> Diboson <b>backgrounds,</b> <b>the</b> t¯t <b>background,</b> <b>the</b> tW <b>background</b> and <b>the</b> Drell-Yan <b>background</b> are relevant and taken from Monte Carlo.

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{the dynamics of}} a single probe brane on various cosmological brane <b>backgrounds.</b> <b>The</b> on-shell condition of the static probe brane leads to the supersymmetric intersection rules for static BPS configurations, though <b>the</b> cosmological <b>backgrounds</b> do not preserve any supersymmetries. This is a remarkable feature associated with <b>the</b> cosmological <b>backgrounds</b> because in <b>the</b> static <b>background</b> <b>the</b> on-shell condition of the static brane gives no constraint on the brane configuration. Furthermore, it follows that under this condition there is no velocity-independent force for the probe brane even on <b>the</b> cosmological <b>backgrounds...</b>|$|R

During <b>the</b> <b>backgrounding</b> phase, 337 heifers were grouped by Hp level and monitored daily for signs of BRD. After <b>the</b> <b>backgrounding</b> phase, 193 heifers were then grouped by number of BRD treatments in the finishing phase.
