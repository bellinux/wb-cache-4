5|$|As the Game Boy Advance {{was able}} to handle newer, {{enhanced}} graphics, Ruby and Sapphire were the first games in the series that allowed up to four people <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>information</b> at one time, {{as opposed to the}} previous limit of two. However, the development team used a more basic graphics engine {{in order to keep the}} game simple and not overly confusing. The team wanted the games to appeal to a large audience, so the game was designed to be easy enough for younger generations of children to play, but new features were added to bring the veteran gamers back.|$|E

5|$|The Act was {{subsequently}} amended to promote private development {{of nuclear energy}} under the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program in 1954. In restricting the access to nuclear information to other countries, it created a rift between the United States and its allies, particularly Britain and Canada, which {{had participated in the}} Manhattan Project. This resulted in cumbersome command and control arrangements, and in Britain developing its own nuclear weapons.

As news of the crisis gathered, Morgan returned to Wall Street from his convention late on the night of Saturday, October 19. The following morning, the library of Morgan's brownstone at Madison Avenue and 36th St. had become a revolving door of New York City bank and trust company presidents arriving <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>information</b> about (and seek help surviving) the impending crisis.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a simple access {{protocol}} <b>to</b> <b>shared</b> <b>information</b> in a mobile environment. The objective Abstract. the proposed scheme {{is to allow}} a specified set of users access <b>to</b> <b>shared</b> <b>information</b> and protect the confidentiality of the infor-of mation from users outside this set. The set of users may be updated from time to time. In particular, the duration during which a user is allowed access <b>to</b> the <b>shared</b> <b>information</b> may be restricted. Furthermore, the information itself has limited lifetime and the confidentiality of the information has to be preserved during this lifetime only. The proposed access protocol is in particular suited to the mobile environment, because of the loose binding of the communicating entities. y The number of subscribers is typically very large. Ä J.
