40|$|Abstract. Mobile Ad-hoc {{networks}} (MANETs), providing infrastructure-free wireless instant communication, play {{important role}} in <b>tactical</b> <b>military</b> networks. However, providing security in <b>tactical</b> <b>military</b> MANETs, having very large and dynamic structure without infrastructure support in hostile environments, {{is a very difficult}} task. In order to address security problems in <b>tactical</b> <b>military</b> MANETs, we propose a new HIerarchical MUlti-Tier adaptive ad-hoc network security protocol based on SIgncryption type key exchange Schemes: HIMUTSIS. Our protocol makes contribution to the military MANETs in three major points: Architectural design, cryptographic methods used in military MANETs and key management techniques. Novel architectural design of HIMUT-SIS facilitates certification and key management procedures, provides flexibility and reduces cryptographic workload of the military MANETs. In HIMUTSIS, as a novelty, we offer to use DKEUTS (Direct Key Exchange Using TimeStamp) protocol providing security and performance advantages when compared to some traditional cryptographic methods. Also, multi-security level approach provides adaptive solutions for each layer of the HIMUTSIS. As a key management technique, HIMUTSIS uses hybrid key management approach which reduces rekeying workload of the networks significantly while minimizing single point of failure risk of the military MANET. ...|$|R

However, there is rarely any quantitative evidence given to support this understand-able qualitative assertion. We propose a method for quanti-tatively defining LPD that is based on well known principles of communications theory and open sources of COTS system specifications. Such a method of quantitatively defining LPD allows researchers working in unclassified environments to consider the LPD characteristics of a communications sys-tem while in the design phase, fair comparisons in LPD char-acteristics between competing systems, and the potential for active participation of the electronic warfare (EW) commu-nity in the up front development of future <b>tactical</b> <b>military</b> communications systems~...|$|R
5000|$|The VSC 501 was {{a vehicle}} mounted <b>tactical</b> <b>military</b> {{satellite}} terminal Initially operated by 249 Signal Squadron (AMF(L)) (disbanded) {{and then by}} 30th Signal Regiment, and the Royal Marines. It operated in the military SHF SATCOM frequency band of 7.25 to 8.4 GHz via a geosynchronous satellite, with a data rate of up to 512 kbit/s. The normal manning level for an VSC 501 station was a crew of two and the system could be set up to provide communications within 15 minutes. The VSC 501 was the workhorse of the UK <b>tactical</b> <b>military</b> SATCOM system for some years. It was carried in both Land Rover (Army) and BV 206 All Terrain Vehicles (Royal Marines).
