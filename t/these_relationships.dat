Their Crimean outpost of Cherson maintained trade with the Pechenegs and the emerging power of the Kievan Rus'; Byzantine missionaries led the Christianization of the Magyars; and the Slavic princes of the western Balkans came to once again acknowledge the suzerainty of the Empire, particularly after Caslav Klonimirovic ended Bulgarian control over Serbia. <b>These</b> <b>relationships</b> on the periphery of the Bulgarian Empire were an important asset for Byzantine diplomacy: instigating attacks against Bulgaria by the Pechenegs and the Khazars was a time-honoured method of applying pressure on the Bulgarians.|$|E

It was normal for unmarried Anglo-Norman noblemen to have sexual relations with prostitutes and local women, and kings were also expected to have mistresses. Some of <b>these</b> <b>relationships</b> occurred before Henry was married, but many others took place after his marriage to Matilda.

In 2003, molecular phylogenetic studies using nuclear and mitochondrial genes by Anne Yoder and colleagues showed that all native Malagasy carnivorans share a common ancestry that excludes other carnivores (meaning they form a clade, making them monophyletic) and are most closely related to Asian and African Herpestidae. To reflect <b>these</b> <b>relationships,</b> all Malagasy carnivorans are now placed in a single family, Eupleridae.

5|$|Most {{laboratory}} {{techniques for}} growing bacteria use {{high levels of}} nutrients to produce large amounts of cells cheaply and quickly. However, in natural environments, nutrients are limited, meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely. This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies (see r/K selection theory). Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available, such as the formation of algal (and cyanobacterial) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer. Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments, such as the production of multiple antibiotics by Streptomyces that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms. In nature, many organisms live in communities (e.g., biofilms) that may allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses. <b>These</b> <b>relationships</b> can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms (syntrophy).|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of morphological characteristics and gene sequences {{has supported the}} basal position within the genus long suspected of D.regia, often regarded as the most ancient of all extant Drosera species. Its distinct morphology and unique relict characteristics, ones it likely shared with the common ancestor of all Drosera such as the operculate pollen, led early researchers to suggest its ancient position in the genus. The first cladistic analysis based on rbcL and morphological data confirmed these ideas and suggested that D.regia formed a clade sister to all other Drosera surveyed, with Dionaeamuscipula forming a sister clade to all Drosera. Further analysis in 2002 based on the nuclear 18S rDNA, plastid DNA (rbcL, matK, atpB), and morphological data confirmed <b>these</b> <b>relationships,</b> supporting the basal position of D.regia in the genus and its close relationship with Dionaea and Aldrovanda. New analysis in 2003 revealed a close relationship between D.regia and D.arcturi, both of which clustered basally with respect to all other Drosera, suggesting a link between D.regia and all other Drosera through its relationship with D.arcturi.|$|E

Nevertheless, the prince was severely criticised from many quarters of society for his apparent lack of interest in her very serious illness with rheumatic fever.
