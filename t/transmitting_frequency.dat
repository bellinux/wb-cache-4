25|$|The modem is {{sometimes}} called the terminal unit and is an electronic device which is connected between the teleprinter and the radio transceiver. The transmitting part of the modem converts the digital signal transmitted by the teleprinter or tape reader to {{one or the other}} of a pair of audio frequency tones, traditionally 2295/2125Hz (US) or 2125/1955Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds to the mark condition and the other to the space condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an SSB transmitter to produce the final audio-frequency shift keying (AFSK) radio frequency signal. Some transmitters are capable of direct frequency-shift keying (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequency</b> according to the mark or space input state. In this case the transmitting part of the modem is bypassed.|$|E
2500|$|The Novice class {{created by}} the 1951 {{decision}} was the entry-level license; it remained the primary entry license until the Morse code requirement was eliminated for Technician licenses in 1990. [...] On HF it permitted code transmissions only, with a maximum power of 75 watts, (input to the transmitter's final amplifier stage) on limited segments of the 80, 40 and 15 meter bands, and on VHF, both code and voice privileges on 145–147MHz. [...] Initially, they were also limited to crystal control of the <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequency,</b> a restriction that was lifted in 1972. At the same time, the Novice CW bands were shifted on the 40m band {{and access to the}} 2m voice/code was revoked and a code segment on the 10m band was added. To qualify for a Novice license, a candidate would have to pass a 5 word-per-minute (WPM) Morse code test (send and receive) and a 25- (later 30-) question multiple-choice test. [...] The Novice Class license was valid for one year, as it was intended only as an entry level; within the year, the Novice was expected to move up to General (or Conditional). Under incentive licensing in the 60s, the term of the Novice class was extended to two years. In 1978 the Novice changed into a renewable license with the same five-year validity as other classes.|$|E
