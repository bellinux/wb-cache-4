30|$|In this article, relay {{selection}} for cooperative networks is investigated. Assuming two users scenario, and N relays are available, BEP and outage probability are computed {{for the case}} of sharing the two ordered best relays for AF and DF relaying schemes. Analytical expressions for the BEP and the outage probability are derived for the different scenarios. Simulation results validate the analytical expressions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BEP <b>performance.</b> <b>The</b> BEP <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed schemes were also compared with <b>the</b> BEP <b>performances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best and next-best relays. In DF scheme, <b>the</b> BEP <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best relay outperforms <b>the</b> BEP <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sharing scenario. But, <b>the</b> BEP <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> BF-DF scenario outperforms <b>the</b> BEP <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordered best relay. Furthermore, <b>the</b> BEP <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> equally sharing <b>the</b> two best ordered relays for AF outperforms <b>the</b> BEP <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordered best relay. Efficient channel utilization is achieved by using STBC and BF.|$|R

5|$|The two-octave {{diatonic}} accordion (gorodo), popular across Madagascar, {{is believed}} to have been imported by French colonists after 1896. In the 20th century, the instrument was commonly performed during tromba spirit possession ceremonies in a style called renitra. In the 1970s, the renitra was incorporated for <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> electrified salegy music. This accordion style was also integrated into <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> tsapika, while also inspiring the style used by the guitarists in these bands. Although today the sound of the accordion is most often replicated by a synthesizer in salegy or tsapika bands due to the expense and rarity of the instrument, accordions continue to hold a privileged place in <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> tromba ceremonial music. Artists like half-brothers Lego and Rossy have gained success as accordion players. Régis Gizavo brought the contemporary style of renitra to the world music scene, winning several international awards for his accordion performance.|$|E

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{treatment of}} aqueous solutions contaminated by Acid Orange 7 (AO 7) was widely studied {{with the main}} objective to evaluate as the electrocatalytic route affects <b>the</b> <b>performances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> degradation process in macro and microfluidic cells. Direct anodic oxidation (EO), electro-Fenton (EF), electro-generation of active chlorine (IOAC) and coupled processes were investigated in macro and microfluidic reactors in order to select more effective conditions {{for the treatment of}} such compound. The effect of numerous operative parameters (such as nature of the electrode materials, coupling of processes, flow rate, current density and inter-electrode distance) on <b>the</b> <b>performances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process was studied in detail. It was found that the catalytic route affects strongly <b>the</b> <b>performances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process in terms of removal of color, abatement of AO 7 and COD and nature of by-products. Furthermore, different operative conditions were required to optimize the various electrocatalytic routes. The utilization of micro devices allowed to work without the addition of a supporting electrolyte and improved <b>the</b> <b>performances</b> <b>of</b> EO and EF that are kinetically controlled by mass transfer processes.
