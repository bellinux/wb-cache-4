40|$|Colicins are protein {{antibiotics}} synthesised by Escherichia coli strains {{to target}} and kill related bacteria. To prevent host suicide, colicins are inactivated by binding to immunity proteins. Despite their high avidity (K(d) ≈ fM, lifetime ≈ 4 days), immunity protein release is a pre-requisite of colicin intoxication, which occurs on a timescale of minutes. Here, {{by measuring the}} dynamic force spectrum of the dissociation of the DNase domain of colicin E 9 (E 9) and immunity protein 9 (Im 9) complex using an atomic force microscope we show that application of low forces (< 20 pN) increases the rate of complex dissociation 10 (6) -fold, to a timescale (lifetime ≈ 10 ms) compatible with intoxication. We term this catastrophic force-triggered increase in off-rate a trip bond. Using mutational analysis, we elucidate the mechanism of this switch in affinity. We show that the N-terminal region of E 9, which has sparse contacts with the hydrophobic core, is linked to an allosteric activator region in E 9 (residues 21 - 30) whose remodelling triggers immunity protein release. Diversion of the force transduction pathway {{by the introduction of}} appropriately positioned disulfide bridges yields a force resistant complex with a lifetime identical to that measured by ensemble techniques. A <b>trip</b> <b>switch</b> within E 9 is ideal for its function as it allows bipartite complex affinity, whereby the stable colicin:immunity protein complex required for host protection can be readily converted to a kinetically unstable complex whose dissociation is necessary for cellular invasion and competitor death. More generally, the observation of two force phenotypes for the E 9 :Im 9 complex demonstrates that force can re-sculpt the underlying energy landscape, providing new opportunities to modulate biological reactions in vivo; this rationalises the commonly observed discrepancy between off-rates measured by dynamic force spectroscopy and ensemble methods...|$|E

A Tabu list is formed for the <b>tripped</b> <b>switches.</b> The index is to energize as much as possible loads with as less as possible operated times.

In Study 1 a number of such measures were included in a survey questionnaire requesting a total of 770 randomly selected respondents to rate how likely they would be to choose the different measures. The ratings suggested that for shopping trips choosing closer stores and trip chaining {{are more likely to be}} chosen than any other measure. A similar pattern was observed for leisure <b>trips.</b> <b>Switching</b> to public transport was the most likely choice for work trips.

In Study 2 it was determined in interviews what choices households would make in forming car-use reduction intentions, then 1 -week travel diaries were collected to assess whether their car-use intentions were implemented. A random sample of 113 multiperson households participated. They expected to be able to change approximately 10 % of their car trips. However they made many more trips than they had expected. Constraints, perceived costs, and preferences for different car-use reduction measures may all play a role for the choices.

Methods 655 commuters in Cambridge, UK reported perceptions of their commuting route and past-week commuting trips in postal questionnaires in 2009 and 2010. Associations between changes in route perceptions and changes in time spent walking and cycling, proportion of car <b>trips,</b> and <b>switching</b> to or from {{the car on the}} commute were modelled using multivariable regression. ResultsChanges in only a few perceptions were associated with changes in travel behaviour. Commuters who reported that it became less pleasant to walk recorded a 6 % (95 % CI: 1, 11) net increase in car trips and a 12 min/week (95 % CI: − 1, − 24) net decrease in walking. Increases in the perceived danger of cycling or of crossing the road were also associated with increases in car trips.

We produced "triggered oocytes," in which due to a neutralizing anticdc 25 antibody, the activation of cdc 2 kinase is prevented out cdc 25 protein is phosphorylated slightly after the maturation-inducing hormonal stimulus. In contrast to control immature oocytes, in triggered oocytes the injected cdc 2 kinase is not inactivated, and accordingly the level of cdc 2 kinase activity required for meiosis reinitiation is much less. These results imply {{the presence of a}} cdc 2 kinase activity-independent process(es) that suppresses the inactivator for cdc 2 kinase and initially phosphorylates cdc 25 protein, although this process is reversible during the initial activation of cdc 2 kinase.

Considerable marginal effects were found for several variables, e. g. : young people and females were less likely to switch to car; short and middle distance trips were less likely abandoned or switched to another day; commute and business trips were more likely done by car, and business trips less likely cancelled.

40|$|Some motor {{operated}} valves now have higher torque switch settings due to regulatory requirements to ensure valve operability with appropriate margins at design basis conditions. Verifying operability with these settings imposes higher stem loads during periodic inservice testing. These higher test loads increase stresses {{in the various}} valve internal parts which may in turn increase the fatigue usage factors. This increased fatigue is judged to be a concern primarily in the valve disks, seats, yokes, stems, and stem nuts. Although the motor operators may also have significantly increased loading, they are being evaluated by the manufacturers and are {{beyond the scope of}} this study. Two gate valves representative of both relatively weak and strong valves commonly used in commercial nuclear applications were selected for fatigue analyses. Detailed dimensional and test data were available for both valves from previous studies at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. Finite element models were developed to estimate maximum stresses in the internal parts of the valves and to identity the critical areas within the valves where fatigue may be a concern. Loads were estimated using industry standard equations for calculating torque switch settings prior and subsequent to the testing requirements of USNRC Generic Letter 89 [...] 10. Test data were used to determine both; (1) the overshoot load between torque <b>switch</b> <b>trip</b> and final seating of the disk during valve closing and (2) the stem thrust required to open the valves.

Unfortunately, not only might models such as these require substantial computational resources, but generating and updating them is even more demanding. Modelbuilding algorithms tend to be bad in three ways: requiring large amounts of CPU and memory to run, needing large amounts of data from the outside to stay up to date, and running so slowly that can't keep up with any fast changes in the environment that might occur. We can solve these problems by reducing the scope of the model to the immediate locale of the device, since reducing the size of the model makes the problem of model generation much more tractable. But such models are also much less useful, having no knowledge of the wider system. This thesis proposes a better solution to this problem called Level of Detail, after the computer graphics technique of the same name. Instead of simplifying the representation of distant objects, however, we simplify less-important data. Compute devices in the system receive streams of data that is a mixture of detailed data from devices that directly affect them and data summaries (aggregated data) from less directly influential devices. The degree to which the data is aggregated (i. e., how much it is reduced) is determined by calculating an influence metric between the target device and the remote device. The smart controller thus receives a continuous stream of raw data from the adjacent transformer, but only an occasional small status report summarizing all the equipment in a neighborhood {{in another part of the}} city. This thesis describes the data distribution system, the aggregation functions, and the influence metrics that can be used to implement such a system. I also describe my current towards establishing a test environment and validating the concepts, and describe the next steps in the research plan...|$|R
