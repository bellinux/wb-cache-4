In 2018, the upper section of the spillway which was undamaged by the flood but also has been identified as structurally defective, will be demolished and rebuilt. In addition, crews are working to extend a cutoff wall under the emergency spillway to prevent erosion should <b>that</b> <b>structure</b> be used again in the future.|$|E

5|$|Harriman Station, {{formerly}} known as Turner Station until 1910, was the first station on the Erie Railroad Main Line west of Newburgh Junction tower in Harriman, New York. Built {{on the side of}} Grove Street in Harriman, the station depot was constructed originally as Turner Station in 1838, as a three story hotel-train station combination. This station caught fire in 1873 and was replaced by a one-story wooden structure. <b>That</b> <b>structure</b> survived as long as its predecessor before it began decaying and was replaced in 1911 with a new station on land donated by the widow of Edward Henry Harriman. A new one-story structure was built on the land. The station was maintained as a one-story depot with a large monument to the side dedicated to the work of Charles Minot. Minot was a director of the Erie Railroad who, in 1851, while his train was stopped at Turner, made the first railroad call by telegraph.|$|E
5|$|Many {{problems}} in data analysis concern clustering, grouping data items into clusters of closely related items. Hierarchical clustering is {{a version of}} cluster analysis in which the clusters form a hierarchy or tree-like structure rather than a strict partition of the data items. In some cases, this type of clustering may be performed {{as a way of}} performing cluster analysis at multiple different scales simultaneously. In others, the data to be analyzed naturally has an unknown tree structure and the goal is to recover <b>that</b> <b>structure</b> by performing the analysis. Both of these kinds of analysis can be seen, for instance, in the application of hierarchical clustering to biological taxonomy. In this application, different living things are grouped into clusters at different scales or levels of similarity (species, genus, family, etc). This analysis simultaneously gives a multi-scale grouping of the organisms of the present age, and aims to accurately reconstruct the branching process or evolutionary tree that in past ages produced these organisms.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} surrounds the nucleus, separating its contents from the cytoplasm. It has two membranes, each a lipid bilayer with associated proteins. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane, and like <b>that</b> <b>structure,</b> features ribosomes attached to the surface. The outer membrane is also continuous with the inner nuclear membrane since the two layers are fused together at numerous tiny holes called nuclear pores that perforate the {{nuclear envelope}}. These pores are about 120 nm in diameter and regulate the passage of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, permitting some {{to pass through the}} membrane, but not others. Since the nuclear pores are located in an area of high traffic, they {{play an important role in}} the physiology of cells. The space between the outer and inner membranes is called the perinuclear space and is joined with the lumen of the rough ER.|$|E

25|$|In Dimmit County, Giles {{had been}} {{selected}} in 1883 to design the first Dimmit County Courthouse to be located at 103 N. 5th Street in Carrizo Springs, Texas. The county changed its mind and hired J. C. Breeding & Sons.

25|$|Over time, the {{historic}} district has lost three structures. One, a silo southwest of Barn #3, was extant as late as 1950. A second was a small, gable-roofed structure which resembled a shed or similar outbuilding. <b>That</b> <b>structure</b> was east of Barn #3. The final lost building was between Barns #2 and #3, along an east-west orientation. Historic photographs show the building was a small, residential structure with human-scaled doorways, {{which may have been}} a laboratory of some sort.|$|E

25|$|The Chou–Fasman method {{takes into}} account only the {{probability}} that each individual amino acid will appear in a helix, strand, or turn.

While Copeland anticipated that construction would be completed by November, the school was not officially dedicated until December 6, 1930. The following year (1931-32), the school had a principal and seven teachers.
