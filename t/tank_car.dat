In a ten-day process that continued as a typhoon raged off Okinawa, the aircraft were stripped of unnecessary equipment such as armor and gun turrets, and the resulting empty spaces in the fuselage were faired over with smooth metal to minimize parasitic drag. Blister-type bubble windows were replaced with flat ones, painted group markings were removed, and the aluminum aircraft skin polished to a high luster, all {{in order to achieve}} the least possible drag. Twentieth Air Force markings were painted on each vertical rudder. The bomb bay in each aircraft was fitted with five 600-gallon (2,300L) fuel tanks; added to the normal B-29 fuel tanks, this made a total of 10,000 gallons (38,000L) of fuel capacity, as much as a railroad <b>tank</b> <b>car.</b> Filled with fuel and 12 men, each ship weighed —it would be the greatest overload attempted on a B-29 at that time.|$|E

The alleged CWA violations, included in an amended complaint filed in March 2009, are for the discharge of tons of chlorine, a hazardous substance, from a derailed train <b>tank</b> <b>car</b> and thousands of gallons of diesel fuel from ruptured locomotive engine fuel tanks. For the alleged Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) violation for failure to immediately notify the National Response Center of the chlorine release, Norfolk Southern will pay a penalty of $32,500, to be deposited in the Hazardous Substance Superfund. Under the terms of the agreement, Norfolk Southern will provide incident command system training to environmental and transportation personnel; stock nearby Langley Pond with at least 3,000 fish to replace fish killed by the chlorine spill; and post the telephone number for the National Response Center to facilitate spill reporting.

Continuing north, downtown Greensburg was completely devastated by the tornado, with numerous businesses destroyed. Two schools, a tractor supply company, the Greensburg City Hall and other businesses fell victim to the violent winds and were destroyed or flattened. A motel {{on the west side of}} town was severely damaged, trees throughout the town were completely denuded and debarked, and vehicles were thrown hundreds of feet. The city's water tower was completely toppled and smashed, and the visitor's center at the Big Well (which is the world's largest hand-dug well) was completely destroyed.
