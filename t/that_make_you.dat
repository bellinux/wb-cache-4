It included one documentary DVD chronicling the band's history, {{and a second}} DVD with music videos, the making of their videos and live performances. An unauthorized biography DVD Things <b>That</b> <b>Make</b> <b>You</b> Go MMM! was also released in June 2006. The DVD does not actually feature any My Chemical Romance music clips or performances but contains interviews with those who knew the band before much of their fame. A biography titled Something Incredible This Way Comes was also released, written by Paul Stenning and published in 2006. It features information on their beginnings right through to their third album, The Black Parade.|$|E

500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} {{review for}} MSN Music, Robert Christgau deemed Graduation a [...] "minor success" [...] in which [...] "every single track offers up its momentary pleasures—choruses <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> say yeah on songs you've already found wanting, confessional details and emotional [...] on an album that still reduces to quality product when they're over". However, he felt West {{spent too much}} of the album rationalizing his obsession with his fame in sketchy fashion and occasionally awkward rhymes, [...] "little stuff like his failure to convert 'this'-'crib'-'shit'-'live'-'serious' into a rhyme" [...] on [...] "Champion" [...] or [...] "'at bay at a distance' into an idiom" [...] on [...] "Big Brother".|$|E

500|$|No {{comparable}} {{analysis has}} ever been done on films released during the late-summer dump months. At the end of July 2008, Vulture again greeted the coming month with two posts on the drop in movie quality historically associated with the month, and its theories for what might explain that. One was {{a history of the}} previous 15 Augusts, with movies released in each month subjectively rated as [...] "halfway-decent" [...] or [...] "lousy". It concluded that over that time there had been 169 lousy movies, and 26 halfway-decent ones.

500|$|Season 14 {{received}} generally positive reviews. High-Def Digest {{was positive}} recommending {{the set and}} writing [...] "The show has numerous moments <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> laugh." [...] and gave it 3.5/5 stars. Blu-ray.com also gave season 14 3.5/5 stars who thought [...] "After rewatching all of {{it for the first}} time since this batch of episodes originally aired, I have to say—season fourteen has a pretty good laugh-per- minute ratio." [...] Casey Broadwater also felt it was an improvement over the Scully seasons and season 13. Collider gave the season a B-. The reviewer thought [...] "As far as the overall quality of the season, it isn't as consistently good as some earlier seasons but in the evolution of the show and the characters, it's solid.". Jackson Cresswell thought [...] "C.E.D'oh" [...] was the best of the season along with [...] "Pray Anything" [...] and [...] "Brake My Wife, Please" [...] while citing [...] "Three Gays of the Condo", [...] "Large Marge", and [...] "Helter Shelter" [...] as the worst. Ryan Keefer of DVD Talk gave it a 4/5 calling it [...] "a good spot to start brushing up on things,".|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rolling Stone, Marisa G.

Sober, Gaga was still at her outlandish peak." [...] David Drake of Complex found the ArtRave to be quite a production but like all things Gaga does he found it to be a [...] "blend of the high-brow and the trashy, depth and superficiality, the thoughtful and the impulsive, and lots of other contradictions <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> think about the nature of philosophy and life and art." [...] He gave a positive review of the main show, praising the sound system, the performances of [...] "Gypsy" [...] and [...] "Do What U Want", and deduced that: [...] "Perhaps this kind of ambition is music's future, at least for a certain breed of artist. Although Artpop doesn't sound retro per se, Lady Gaga's project as a whole does feel like a reaction to the idea that as far as the music goes, there's nothing new under the sun." ...|$|E

500|$|In the release, Steven Grover, BK Vice President of Global Food Safety, Quality Assurance, and Regulatory Compliance, {{confirmed}} the factuality of the QSR report {{and that if}} the dispute between the growers and the CIW continues, the company would go forward with its plans to stop purchasing tomatoes from farms in the Immokalee region. The company stated it would purchase only one percent of its tomatoes from that area and other suppliers could easily make up the difference. Speaking on the dispute, Grover stated, [...] "We’re {{being asked to do}} something that we have legal questions about. We want {{to find a way to}} make sure that workers are protected and receive a decent wage." [...] CIW spokesperson Julia Perkins faulted this move, stating, [...] "...farm workers across the country and world face the same problems as those in the Immokalee region, but many do not have a human rights organization, such as the CIW, to stand up for their interests. Running away from the scene of the crime, does <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> any more innocent? Are they really willing to pay an exorbitantly higher transportation cost to bring in tomatoes from overseas or Mexico and pass that on to their customers rather than pay a penny more per pound?" ...|$|E
500|$|Joey Thurmond of Push Square wrote how playing {{through the}} {{campaign}} from Modern Warfare {{reminded him of}} its sheer memorability and how it had long endured with fans compared with other games in the series, saying [...] "there's tension and gravity shot through the experience, {{as if the world}} is on your shoulders to push past every enemy line with explosive bravado or exacting stealth. [...] There's a grounded feel to player characters <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> another cog in the machine with the abilities and limitations of an ordinary soldier, not a supernatural saviour." [...] He praised the game's graphical enhancements, saying [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered looks and sounds like a fresh game on par with today's graphical and aural standards" [...] and calling it a [...] "ridiculously faithful remake", but wrote that the game still showed some slight signs of age, such as artificial intelligence problems and pacing issues. In short, he commended Raven Software [...] "for arguably delivering the most substantial, masterful remake we have ever experienced", and that [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered celebrates this legacy with updated visuals and sound that really go above and beyond the call of duty, sprucing up an old care package for a more modern age to near-perfection." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé's mother-manager Tina Knowles {{said that}} Dangerously in Love showcases her musical roots. While Williams and Rowland were on gospel and {{alternative}} pop, respectively, Beyoncé focused on recording R songs. Songs in the album are varied: from mid-tempo and club-oriented {{tracks in the}} first half, and ballads in the second half. Beyoncé commented: [...] "My album is a good balance of... ballads and... mid-tempos with just ridin'-in-your-car feels, to a lot of... up-tempo club songs, to really sexy songs, to songs <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> feel emotional. It's a nice mixture {{of different types of}} tracks." [...] Although the album contains high-energy songs like [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] and [...] "Naughty Girl", the album's focal mode, however, is slow and moody. Beyoncé said that she had written lots of ballads for the album. According to Beyoncé, she wanted to be understood as an artist and showcase her range, and by doing so, she blended various genres and musical influences in the album. The album incorporates R, hip hop, soul and reggae influences. The album took hip hop influences from Jay-Z, Outkast, and Lil' Kim; the reggae is from Sean Paul; and courtesy of Storch, the album explores Arabic music. His personal study of that kind of music gave the album a Middle Eastern vibe. Beyoncé and the producers also used a wide array of instrumentations.|$|E

500|$|... "Fix a Heart" [...] is a pop piano ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and {{thirteen}} seconds. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, it is composed in the key of C major and has a tempo of 54 beats per minute. Lovato's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. The singer performs the verses in a low register, while the chorus is sang in a higher note. Sputnikmusic's Raul Stanciu noted that the singer's voice [...] "never go full power, only for the chorus". Similarly, Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote that the artist [...] "breaks from a whisper into [...] stadium-size refrain". The track {{has been described by}} some critics and the singer herself as a break-up song, which is demonstrated in the chorus, [...] "Baby, I just ran out of bandaids / I don't even know where to start / 'Cause you can bandage the damage / You never really can fix a heart". Jenny Chen of Neon Tommy wrote that Lovato [...] "openly admits her weaknesses, including an ability to move on from a broken heart left behind by a former love". Regarding the line [...] "You never really can fix a heart", the artist told Glamour that, [...] "I think every time you get your heart broken, there's a little piece of it that chips away, and I don't think you ever get that piece back. But I think you're able to bandage it with time and with new people and other things <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> happy".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} praised by critics who {{agreed that it}} was Rowland's best chance of {{reaching}} the US Billboard Hot 100 again. They praised both production and vocal delivery of the song. Robbie Daw of Idolator said that, although he [...] "liked the dancability of the Kelly's upbeat tunes," [...] it was [...] "as nice to hear her take on a ballad again." [...] He called the single her best chance of [...] "finally crack {{the upper reaches of the}} Hot 100 once again." [...] Following the video's premier, Daw said that, alongside [...] "Kelly looking stunning in the video," [...] the song had [...] "hit" [...] potential. [...] "Surely the timing is right—especially with all the other singles Dr. Luke has had a hand in dominating the charts—for Rowland to be allowed into the spotlight once more." [...] Lizzie Goodwin of Gather.com agreed that the song, though different from her previous singles, stands on its own as a catchy tune. [...] "Though it’s no 'When Love Takes Over', Kelly Rowland’s latest single and music video 'Rose Colored Glasses' isn’t half-bad. It might not be a dance hit, but her new single is pretty catchy and is a great addition to include in a breakup/girl empowerment playlist." [...] Mack from Sound-Savvy said, [...] "Kelly always makes those love songs <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> re-examine things...While I don’t think Rose Colored Glasses will impact as hard as Commander, it's a formidable single in its own right and I kinda like it." [...] Despite accepting that Rowland has had her moments with the club songs, Melinda Newman of HitFix praised Dr. Luke's production work, stating that [...] "the song is a show stopper (a nice production by him- we often find him too slick)." [...] Jeremy Helligar of True/Slant said that Rowland had done a smart thing by not releasing [...] "Commander" [...] in the United States. He said, [...] " [...] edgier preference of dance music is very different to the dance-pop that Lady Gaga often tops the charts with." [...] He later added that the song was [...] "still to the left of what normally passes for modern R." [...] PopinStereo said that the electro ballad [...] "sounds fresh and breathtaking" [...] thanks to an [...] "amazing production" [...] and [...] "great vocal delivery." ...|$|E

[...] Although the songs that would appear on Wintersun had collectively been written between 1995 and 2004 (see each track's respective composition dates here), Mäenpää kept his songwriting efforts primarily focused on folk metal band Ensiferum, with whom he'd been playing since 1996.|$|E

[...] He continued to give an explanation {{as to why the}} songs are similar writing [...] "On the surface, similarities between the two are almost non-existent, but on closer inspection, not only are they the danciest cuts on their respective LPs, they're both favourites that fans have been eager to see get an official release." [...] Copsey concluded his review praising the song and Rihanna, writing [...] "Like Rihanna herself, it's hectic, confident and unashamedly sexual." [...] Meghan Brownfield for the Columbia Missourian praised the song as a track which people will want to dance to as well as writing that the lyrics ensure that the listener pays attention to the lyrics, saying [...] "It is a song you would hear in a club that everyone would want to dance to. This song makes you want to move, and it also has some strong lyrics <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> focus on what she is saying." [...] Matthew Cole for Slant Magazine, however, was critical of the song, writing that the song is a [...] "boring dubstep-normalizing dance number reminiscent of LMFAO," [...] as well as Rihanna's own [...] "We Found Love".|$|E
