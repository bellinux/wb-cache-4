5|$|Another issue {{concerned}} <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> president. Few {{agreed with}} Madison that the executive should be {{elected by the}} legislature. There was widespread concern with direct election, because information diffused so slowly in the late 18th century, and because of concerns that people would only vote for candidates from their state or region. A vocal minority wanted the national executive to be chosen by the governors of the states.|$|E

Following <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coalition government in the 1949 election, Blamey wrote to the new Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, again requesting honours for his generals.

5|$|By 2003, many Turks {{had come}} to see American foreign policy in the region as a threat.

The defeat spelled the end of Wong's political career and <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DAP's Wong Ho Leng to the Sarawak State Assembly.

5|$|Election {{days for}} the Bundestag and the European Parliament are also flag days in some states, in {{addition}} to other state-specific flag days.

When flags are required to be flown at half-staff, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the staff (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).|$|E

For other candidates to be nominated, support from members of smaller parties, independents (of which there are currently 14 TDs and 11 senators) or excess members of the three larger parties was needed, or the support of four local authorities.|$|E
