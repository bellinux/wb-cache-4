50|$|Durham University Treasure Trap {{was founded}} in February 1983 {{with the aim of}} helping members travel to Peckforton Castle. When the {{original}} Treasure Trap folded, members began running day-long adventures in the woods around Durham using the original Treasure Trap system. The society remains active today, and celebrated its 30th Anniversary in 2013. It holds over sixty events a year and stakes claim to being the longest continuous running LARP and LARP world, with the world's history defined by over 30 years of role-play. Locations used by the society include Maiden Castle. The rules system has undergone many profound changes since the society was formed although it is still recognisable as a descendant of the original Treasure Trap. The society runs weekly 'Interactives' set in a medieval themed bar, in which plot is generally dispensed and characters interact in a largely combat free environment, these are followed by weekly 'Adventures' which are used to progress or conclude plot, but are generally more combat heavy than <b>the</b> <b>Interactives.</b> DUTT also runs large one off events such as the Third year goodbye (3ygb) in the summer and the Pre-banquet bash in February time, the 3ygb lasts for 3 days and includes many former regulars of the DUTT, who get a chance to influence the world and plot for the years to come. In 2010 DUTT launched Nerd East a LARP/Gaming convention set within the Durham Students' Union, which attracted approximately 150 people in 2010 and close to 200 in 2011, the aim is to make a regular kit fare within the North East, due to its large LARP/Gaming population.|$|E

40|$|Interactive {{learning}} {{has been a}} central concept in innovation studies since the 1980 s and its infl uence on innovation {{has been shown in}} numerous studies since then. Interactive learning is of special importance in emerging technologies like nutrigenomics in which complementary, often tacit knowledge has to be exchanged and combined in order to learn and innovate. However, suffi cient insight into the black box of <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> learning process was lacking thus far. In this book Rens Vandeberg constructs a Framework for Interactive Learning in Emerging Technologies and explores this framework in nutrigenomics consortia. The developed framework encompasses not only <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> learning outcome, but also <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> learning process itself and the conditions that infl uence <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> learning process. <b>The</b> resulting insights provide new means for <b>the</b> stimulation of <b>interactive</b> learning, knowledge creation and innovation management...|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of education, {{interesting}} discussions and researches about including technology in the teaching procedure are in course. In the past decade {{it was possible to}} observe the developement of informational-communication technology in classes- from a compter to interactive boards and other interactive technology. Interactive board is a combination of a computer, projector and a big touch screen which represents and enables tactile, observing and cooperating interaction. Interactive board {{is becoming more and more}} a new symbol of the classroom in the 21 st century. Among teachers it is highly appreciated because of its multifunctionality and the increase of the teaching potential. Many investigators namely believe that the effective use of an <b>interactive</b> board in <b>the</b> classroom makes the lessons better and helps students to a better understanding of the content. In the last few years the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sports stimulates <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> teaching in slovenian schools, with clear expectations that this would lead to an improvement in learning. These expectations are based on the success of such approaches in the other parts of the world. Because of the suppositions of efficency of <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> board and big financial investments all over the world, the researches about the efficency of use of interactive boards are in process. In this diploma work we make researches about interactive teaching in a relation to interactive technology that can be used as a support in teaching. In the first part of the work we introduced the results of different researches all over the world. We defined <b>the</b> notion of <b>interactive</b> board and advantages as well as disadvantages of its use for teachers and students. We described the interactivity and multimedia studying. We presented the main theories of studying and defined connectivism, we described its caracteristics and presented its defenders and critics. We defined factors of the effective use of <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> board and consecrated a particular attention to a teacher's use of <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> board. Reviewing <b>the</b> work of Mrs. Cogill, we presented also a model of pedagogic changes for the analyses of influences on pedagogics. In the second part of this diploma work we presented and interpreted the results of questionaries from teachers and students and completed them with the findings from interviews and analysis of teaching lessons and illustrations. We were stating how often teachers use <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> board at their work, the factors that influence the frequency of use of <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> board and what teachers mean about their own qualification for the effective use of <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> board. We were researching if the frequency of use of <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> board is linked to the support by a school management as well as how the use of <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> board in <b>the</b> process of teaching is linked with the entire development of a teacher. We were establishing the opinions of teachers, students and a school management regarding advantages and disadvantages of <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> boards. We checked what kind of books the teachers use for their work with <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> board and in which way they use them. We were establishing if use of <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> board is positively linked to the teacher's care for the entire developement of students. <b>The</b> <b>interactive</b> board in <b>the</b> class enables teachers the integration of informational-communication technology. For revolution in teaching and learning with use of <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> board it is necessary to invest in the professional development for strengthening the practice and for the support of pedagogic changes. ...|$|R
