5|$|Finally in 1859, Marx {{published}} A Contribution to <b>the</b> <b>Critique</b> of Political Economy, {{his first}} serious economic work. This work was intended {{merely as a}} preview of his three-volume Das Kapital (English title: Capital: Critique of Political Economy), which he intended to publish at a later date. In A Contribution to <b>the</b> <b>Critique</b> of Political Economy, Marx accepts the labour theory of value as advocated by David Ricardo, but whereas Ricardo drew a distinction between use value and value in commodities, Ricardo always {{had been unable to}} define the real relationship between use value and value. The reasoning Marx laid out in his book clearly delineated the true relationship between use value and value. He also produced a truly scientific theory of money and money circulation in the capitalist economy, thus A Contribution to <b>the</b> <b>Critique</b> of Political Economy created a storm of enthusiasm when it appeared in public and the entire edition of the book was sold out quickly.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} disciplines, the initial {{emphasis}} of feminist economists was to critique the established theory, methodology, and policy approaches. <b>The</b> <b>critique</b> began in microeconomics {{of the household}} and labor markets and spread to macroeconomics and international trade, ultimately extending to all areas of traditional economic analysis. Feminist economists pushed for and produced gender aware theory and analysis, broadened the focus on economics and sought pluralism of methodology and research methods.|$|E
5|$|As with {{cultural}} studies, media {{study is a}} distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, literary criticism and critical theory. Though the production process or <b>the</b> <b>critique</b> of aesthetic forms {{is not in the}} remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing factors, such as ideological effects and audience reception, stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.|$|E

5|$|Given the {{repeated}} failures and frustrations of workers' revolutions and movements, Marx {{also sought to}} understand capitalism and {{spent a great deal}} of time in the reading room of the British Museum studying and reflecting on the works of political economists and on economic data. By 1857, Marx had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, landed property, wage labour, the state and foreign trade and the world market, though this work did not appear in print until 1939 under the title Outlines of <b>the</b> <b>Critique</b> of Political Economy.|$|E
5|$|Rothenberg's {{legacy is}} not only the generations of {{scholars}} he prepared, but also his vast historiographical contribution to understanding the Revolutionary era. For many years, his Army of Francis Joseph (1976) was the standard and the only English language analysis of the Habsburg Army in the French Revolutionary and the Napoleonic wars. He changed the widespread perception of Archduke Charles' military acumen. A masterful historian, Rothenberg was known furthermore as an eminently fair scholar. After publishing a critique of a publication, the author contacted him, and proved <b>the</b> <b>critique</b> unjust; Rothenberg immediately wrote to a review retracting the criticism, and the two scholars remained friends for the remainder of his life.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} <b>the</b> <b>critiquing</b> {{approach to}} building knowledge-based interactive systems. Critiquing supports computer users in their {{problem solving and}} learning activities. The challenges {{for the next generation}} of knowledge-based systems provide a context for the development of this paradigm. We discuss critics from the perspective of overcoming the problems of high-functionality computer systems, of providing a new class of systems to support learning, of extending applications-oriented construction kits to design environments, and of providing an alternative to traditional autonomous expert systems. One of <b>the</b> <b>critiquing</b> systems we have built- JANUS, a critic for architectural design- is used as an example for presenting the key aspects of <b>the</b> <b>critiquing</b> process. V. Ie then survey additional critiquing systems developed in our and other reseaich groups. The paper concludes with a discussion of experiences and extensions to the paradigm...|$|R

25|$|Kant {{argued that}} our {{experiences}} are structured by necessary features of our minds. In his view, the mind shapes and structures experience so that, on an abstract level, all human experience shares certain essential structural features. Among other things, Kant {{believed that the}} concepts {{of space and time}} are integral to all human experience, as are our concepts of cause and effect. One important consequence of this view is that our experience of things is always of the phenomenal world as conveyed by our senses: we do not have direct access to things in themselves, the so-called noumenal world. Kant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history. These included <b>the</b> <b>Critique</b> of Practical Reason (Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, 1788), the Metaphysics of Morals (Die Metaphysik der Sitten, 1797), which dealt with ethics, and <b>the</b> <b>Critique</b> of Judgment (Kritik der Urteilskraft, 1790), which looks at aesthetics and teleology.|$|E
