5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable 80-foot PT boat was PT-109, {{commanded}} by future president John F. Kennedy. In the film PT 109, the [...] "Elco" [...] script logo {{can be seen on}} the cockpit <b>throttle</b> <b>housing</b> in several scenes.|$|E
50|$|Key {{specifications}} for race cars were: no chassis modification; {{front and rear}} spoilers as standard, with removal of material permitted for engine cooling; ground clearance front 440 mm, rear 400 mm; sump guard prohibited; engines conforming to Saab-Scania standard H-series Turbo specification, as from model year 1986; oil and water cooler matrices standard; control of wastgate was 'free'; air filter box, element and <b>throttle</b> <b>housing</b> standard; exhaust manifold standard; exhaust system after the manifold was 'free'; the APC system could be deleted; fuel injection equipment standard, with permitted modifications; Saab roadholding kit fitted; Saab anti-roll bar kit fitted; permitted to alter front and rear wheel geometry; clutch uprated to an AP Racing unit; gearbox standard for 1986 model year; Saab-supplied wheels only; specified brake modifications permitted; handbrake could be removed; fuel tank standard; standard power-steering to be retained.|$|E
6000|$|Lady Cicely repeats [...] "My darling" [...] several times. Mr. Harding says [...] "Hush," [...] {{and tries}} to {{disengage}} himself. She won't let him. He offers to ring for tea. She won't have any. [...] "Oh, Jack," [...] she says. [...] "I can't go on any longer. I can't. When first you loved me, I thought I could. But I can't. It <b>throttles</b> me here--this <b>house,</b> this life, everything----" [...] She has drawn him to a sofa and has sunk down in a wave at his feet. [...] "Do you remember, Jack, when first you came, in Italy, that night, at Amalfi, when {{we sat on the}} piazza of the palazzo?" [...] She is looking rapturously into his face.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} designing the mechanical {{components of a}} low-speed axial compressor with cantilevered stators to investigate endwall flow phenomena in the rear stages of industrial gas turbine compressors. The data collected from this research facility will verify and increase the fidelity of CFD models used to design modern industrial gas turbine compressors for Siemens. Siemens provided the aerodynamic design for the compressor while Purdue {{was responsible for the}} inlet, exhaust, and casing designs. At design point, the four-stage compressor has a corrected mass flow rate of 20. 16 kg/s (44. 44 lbm), a corrected rotational speed of 1350 RPM, and a pressure ratio of 1. 09. The compressor is 1. 25 m (4. 1 ft.) in diameter and has a 12. 5 cm (4. 92 in.) annulus height. ^ The aerodynamic and mechanical designs of the inlet and exhaust were completed during this phase of research. The inlet and exhaust systems were designed to maximize work space within the lab. The <b>throttle</b> is also <b>housed</b> within the exhaust system and is controlled by three linear actuators. In addition, preliminary airfoil root designs and a casing design with a bearing traverse system, rotor inserts, and assembly process was prepared. ...|$|R
