40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{current issues}} concerning surgical <b>fellowship</b> <b>training</b> in Canada. Other than {{information from a}} few studies of <b>fellowship</b> <b>training</b> in North America, there are scant data on this subject in the literature. Little {{is known about the}} demographic characteristics of those who pursue <b>fellowship</b> <b>training</b> in Canada, what the experiences and expectations are of fellows and their supervisors with respect to {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} this level of training, or how this level of education fits in with Canadian undergraduate and postgraduate medical training. We summarize current knowledge about <b>fellowship</b> <b>training</b> in Canada as it pertains to demographic characteristics, finances, work hours, residency training, preparation for clinical and research work and satisfaction with training. Most information on surgical <b>fellowship</b> <b>training</b> comes from the United States. As such, we used information from American studies to supplement the Canadian data. Because a surgical fellowship experience in Canada may be different from that in the United States, we propose that Canadian surgical fellows and their supervisors should be surveyed to gain an understanding of such information. This knowledge could be used to improve surgical <b>fellowship</b> <b>training</b> in Canada...|$|R
