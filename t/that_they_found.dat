5|$|Development of The Blair Witch Project {{began in}} 1993. While film {{students}} at the University of Central Florida, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez came across {{the idea for the}} film after realizing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> documentaries on paranormal phenomena scarier than traditional horror films. The two decided to create a film that combined the styles of both. After graduation, Myrick and Sánchez, along with Gregg Hale, Robin Cowie, and Michael Monello started the production company Haxan Films, derived from Benjamin Christensen's 1922 Swedish-Danish silent documentary horror film Häxan, whose English-language title is Witchcraft Through the Ages.|$|E
5|$|Puffins {{have been}} hunted by man since time immemorial. Coastal {{communities}} and island dwellers with few natural resources at their disposal, made {{good use of}} the seafoods <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> on their cliffs and shores. Puffins were caught and eaten fresh, salted in brine or smoked and dried. Their feathers were used in bedding and their eggs were eaten, {{but not to the}} same extent as those of some other seabirds, being more difficult to extract from the nest. In most countries, Atlantic puffins are now protected by legislation, and in the countries where hunting is still permitted, strict laws prevent over-exploitation. They are still caught and eaten in Iceland and the Faroe Islands, but there have been calls for an outright ban on hunting them in Iceland because of concern over the dwindling number of birds successfully raising chicks.|$|E
5|$|The American group wrote {{a scathing}} {{response}} {{to the findings of}} the TWG, stating that they had given too much emphasis on the results from the Dubna group. In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years, a fact that the Russian team does not deny. They also stressed that the TWG had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee. The TWG responded by saying that {{this was not the case}} and having assessed each point raised by the American group said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery. The IUPAC finally used the name suggested by the American team (rutherfordium) which may in some way reflect a change of opinion.|$|E

5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) asks to {{be a part}} of the {{investigation}} looking for a little girl, Amber Lynn LaPierre, who disappeared from her home in Sacramento, California. Mulder's superior, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), initially denies his request, noting that {{the investigation}} is not an X-file, but simply a missing persons case. Mulder, however, convinces Skinner to allow him to investigate. The parents of Amber, Billie and Bud, tell Mulder <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> a note in the girl's bedroom, but the teaser for the episode revealed that the note was written by Billie herself. The note contains a mention of Santa Claus, which everyone finds out of place. Although the family is held for questioning, Mulder does not believe they did it. Looking through previous cases, Mulder finds a similar note, with a reference to Santa Claus, from a missing person case in Idaho from 1987. In the case, the mother was convicted and sentenced to twelve years. The file notes that she had a vision of her son dead before he disappeared, as did Bud on the night his daughter disappeared.|$|E
