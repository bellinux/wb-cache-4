After {{receiving}} {{a call from}} someone who immediately hangs up, Scully leaves her apartment and tells Melissa that she'll head to her home instead. As she leaves, Skinner pulls up in his car, telling her they need to speak in private. Melissa shows up soon afterwards and is mistakenly shot by Luis Cardinal, who is hiding there with Alex Krycek. Realizing they shot the wrong person, the two flee. Meanwhile, after taking Skinner to Mulder's apartment, Scully holds him at gunpoint, believing he is the traitor the Well-Manicured Man spoke of. Skinner tells Scully {{that he is in}} possession of the digital tape. Just <b>then,</b> <b>someone</b> steps outside the door. This distracts Scully enough for Skinner to pull his gun on her.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{development}} of the song by NME.com, vocalist Chris Martin said, [...] "From that version, [...] we went and did a whole other version of it. A whole other song. What happened with the song 'Talk' is that it was all going great and <b>then</b> <b>someone</b> said 'That should be the first single' and we all just freaked out and scrapped it all. [...] We’ve just mixed it and it sounds great. I think we’ve had such pain getting to that place, I’m not sure anyone quite knows {{what to do with it}} anymore. When we heard it mixed properly, it sounded mega." ...|$|E

The band picked [...] "Feeling This" [...] {{as the first}} single because they felt it representative of the transition they had undergone since their fourth studio album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001). A slightly different version of the song had been released previously {{as part of the}} soundtrack for the video game Madden NFL 2004 under the erroneous title [...] "Action". Barker explained in an interview that [...] "'Action' just sounded kind of dorky to us. Like we would always call it 'Feeling This' and <b>then</b> <b>someone</b> at our label, I think, like wrote it as 'Action' one time and sent out singles to people. And it was always supposed to be 'Feeling This'." ...|$|E

500|$|Ed Boon {{recalled}} that for {{six out of}} the eight months {{while they were in}} production of the original Mortal Kombat, [...] "nobody could come up with a name nobody didn't hate". Some of the names suggested included [...] "Kumite", [...] "Dragon Attack", [...] "Death Blow" [...] and just [...] "Fatality". Someone had written down [...] "combat" [...] on the drawing board for the names in Boon's office and <b>then</b> <b>someone</b> wrote a K over the C, according to Boon, [...] "just to be kind of weird". Steve Ritchie, a pinball designer at that time, was sitting in Boon's office and saw the word [...] "Kombat" [...] and said to Boon, 'Why don't you name it Mortal Kombat?' and that name [...] "just stuck". Since then, the series uses the letter [...] "K" [...] in place of [...] "C" [...] for various words containing the hard C sound. According to Boon, during the MK games' development they usually spell the words correctly and only [...] "korrect it" [...] when one of the developers points out they should do it.|$|E
500|$|Concerning inspirations on the season, Loeb {{revealed}} that [...] "Chinatown... {{is one of}} the things that influenced Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos when they created the character. So those kind of beautiful, long, wide expansive shots, where people sort of come into frame and go back out of frame and someone’s in the foreground and <b>then</b> <b>someone</b> is way in the background and they’re having a conversation, that’s the stuff that makes it interesting." [...] Director of Photography Manuel Billeter and episodic director S. J. Clarkson took inspiration from the comics in terms of their color palette, while looking to the works of Wong Kar-wai as reference to create [...] "unconventional" [...] compositions, with Billeter explaining, [...] "There were a lot of foreground elements [...] headroom as well, and we never wanted to show an open frame. We wanted to create a sense of claustrophobia." [...] Billeter shot the season with a Red Epic Dragon camera in 4K resolution, with 5K used for some visual effects shots, and with Panavision PVintage lenses; he focused mostly on static frames and [...] "good composition", but did occasionally employ a camera dolly or steadicam. For lighting, Billeter noted that many New York street lamps had been changed from sodium-vapor lamps to LEDs, so he tried to recreate the [...] "warm, dirty color of sodium vapor" [...] for night exterior scenes.|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} year of {{development}} the team focused mostly on the gameplay without any narrative structure. Playtesters found the game to be fun but asked about what these test chambers were leading towards. This prompted to team {{to come up with a}} narrative for Portal. The Portal team worked with Half-Life series writer Marc Laidlaw on fitting the game into the series' plot. This was done, in part, due to the limited art capabilities of the small team; instead of creating new assets for Portal, they decided to tie the game to an existing franchise—Half-Life—to allow them to reuse the Half-Life 2 art assets. Wolpaw and Faliszek were put to work on the dialogue for Portal. The concept of a computer AI guiding the player through experimental facilities to test the portal gun was arrived at early in the writing process. They drafted early lines for the yet-named [...] "polite" [...] AI with humorous situations, such as requesting the player's character to [...] "assume the party escort submission position", and found this style of approach to be well-suited to the game they wanted to create, ultimately leading to the creation of the GLaDOS character. GLaDOS was central to the plot, as Wolpaw notes [...] "We designed the game to have a very clear beginning, middle, and end, and we wanted GLaDOS to go through a personality shift at each of these points." [...] Wolpaw further describes the idea of using cake as the reward came about as [...] "at the beginning of the Portal development process, we sat down as a group to decide what philosopher or school of philosophy our game would be based on. That was followed by about 15 minutes of silence and <b>then</b> <b>someone</b> mentioned that a lot of people like cake." [...] The cake element along with additional messages given to the player in the behind-the-scenes areas were written and drawn by Kim Swift.|$|E
2500|$|Naomi Clark was {{initially}} {{developed by the}} series' original show-runner, Rob Thomas, who was succeeded by Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah prior to the premiere. Early press releases described the character as a privileged, attractive, and popular teenager, prompting the media to draw comparisons to Kelly Taylor of Beverly Hills, 90210, the first series of the franchise which launched 90210. As production of the spin-off began, the part would become more defined, with actress AnnaLynne McCord, who received the role, labeling Naomi an intelligent girl who possessed both manipulative and sensitive sides. She further described the character as [...] "kind of a chameleon", stating that [...] "she'll be someone with the principal and <b>then</b> <b>someone</b> else {{with her mother and}} <b>then</b> <b>someone</b> else with her friend." ...|$|E

2500|$|Interest in {{the book}} was revived during the 1999 lawsuit between Nancy Stouffer and J.K. Rowling over the {{creation}} of the name [...] "Muggles". An article in the Lawrence Journal-World on June 14, 2000, said Kendall had used the name about 30 years before Stouffer and Rowling. Kendall found the incident amusing and was not ill-disposed towards either author. Speaking about the copying, she said, [...] "I've got no quarrel with them...There's only so many ideas and if you have one <b>then</b> <b>someone</b> else out there probably has the same one, too." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bob {{was also}} parodied on Cartoon Network's MAD in the episode [...] "S'UP / Mouse M.D." [...] In the episode when Mickey Mouse portrays Gregory House {{he goes to}} perform surgery on Bob who smashed his thumb asking similar to his famous catchphrase [...] "Can we fix it?"

He later appears in another episode when Bob interacts with Manny from Handy Manny after they get into a fender bender and get into an {{argument}} with Bob saying [...] "Stop copying my show!" [...] He leaves <b>then</b> <b>someone</b> tells Manny he just got built. In another episode, [...] "Kung Fu Blander / Destroy Bob the Builder Destroy", Mad parodies Bob the Builder and Destroy Build Destroy. In the episode, Andrew W.K. of Destroy Build Destroy, is portrayed as being a jerk towards Bob. Andrew destroys everything Bob builds. In the end, Bob transforms his construction vehicles into Build-Tron (a parody of Voltron). A New Yorker cartoon shows a parent in a toy store asking for toys depicting Alex the Architect, supposedly a white-collar equivalent to Bob the Builder.|$|E

2500|$|Ponting {{started the}} 1999–2000 season poorly, with ducks {{in his first}} three Test innings in the series against Pakistan, {{including}} a pair on his home ground Bellerive Oval. He ended the run in style, scoring 197 in the Third Test at the WACA. Australia won the series 3–0 and Ponting proceeded to score 125 in the First Test against India at the Adelaide Oval. He finished with an unbeaten 141 in the Third Test at the SCG, the culmination of another Australian whitewash. Ponting was the leading scorer for the series, compiling 375 runs at 125.00. He brought this form into {{the initial stages of}} the following 1999–2000 Carlton United ODI series, hitting 32 and 115, before three consecutive ducks. Ponting, however, ended the rut towards the back end of the series, stringing together 53, 43, 33, 50 and 78, as Australia won the tournament. Along with his impressive average of 40.4, Ponting's strike rate (87.06) was the highest of all recognised Australian batsmen. Perhaps more importantly, Ponting was selected as temporary vice-captain when Shane Warne was unavailable through injury, strengthening his claim for future higher honours. [...] "It's now apparent to me that I'm one being viewed as a future Australia captain", Ponting acknowledged in his newspaper column. [...] "I think it's fair to say unless I was being considered for a future leadership position in the team <b>then</b> <b>someone</b> with significantly more experience, like Mark [...] would have been given the nod to be the team's vice-captain. Despite all his good fortune, Ponting slid into the boundary fence and seriously damaged his ankle during the second final against Pakistan, forcing him to miss the upcoming ODI series' in New Zealand and South Africa. The damaged ligaments required a two-hour operation, with doctors telling him how {{he would not be able}} to return to cricket until the next summer. He recovered quicker than expected and by May he returned to the golf course and was given approval to start cricket training. He returned to the international scene in August for a three-match ODI series against South Africa in Melbourne's indoor Docklands Stadium. He made only 60 runs, as the series was tied 1–1, with a tie.|$|E
