5|$|In 1279 A.D., the {{downfall}} of the Chola dynasty seems imminent as the Pandyas drive the Chola people out of their kingdom in southern India. To escape them and save the life of his successor the Chola emperor sends his son along with the Chola people to a secret territory. The refugees <b>take</b> <b>along</b> an idol sacred to the Pandyas, angering them. To capture the escaped Cholas and the stolen idol, the Pandyas extend their invasion to unexplored territories but cannot find them.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Muslims divided their forces: {{the bulk}} of the army, under Abbas, {{remained}} at Kamacha to continue the siege, while the remainder (an obviously exaggerated force of 50,000 according to the Zuqnin chronicler) was sent to raid further into Byzantine territory and pillage. The siege continued through the autumn, and the Arabs, who customarily did not <b>take</b> <b>along</b> many provisions, began suffering from lack of supplies. To solve their supply problems, they established a market for merchants from Mesopotamia and elsewhere. In the end, with winter approaching, Abbas was forced to raise the siege and retreat south, burning the large market-place to prevent it from falling into Byzantine hands.|$|E

25|$|The {{border between}} the two states became a major irritant, and in November 1997 a border {{committee}} {{was set up to}} try to resolve that specific dispute. After federation and before independence the line of the border had been of minor importance because it was only a demarcation line between federated provinces and initially the two governments tacitly agreed that the border should remain as it had been immediately before independence. However, on independence the border became an international frontier, and the two governments could not agree on the line that the border should <b>take</b> <b>along</b> its entire length, and they looked back to the colonial period treaties between Italy and Ethiopia for a basis in international law for the precise line of the frontier between the states. Problems then arose because they could not agree on the interpretation of those agreements and treaties, and it was not clear under international law how binding colonial treaties were on the two states.|$|E
25|$|Allan Quatermain, an adventurer {{and white}} hunter based in Durban, {{in what is}} now South Africa, is {{approached}} by aristocrat Sir Henry Curtis and his friend Captain Good, seeking his help finding Sir Henry's brother, who was last seen travelling north into the unexplored interior on a quest for the fabled King Solomon's Mines. Quatermain has a mysterious map purporting to lead to the mines, but had never taken it seriously. However, he agrees to lead an expedition in return for a share of the treasure, or a stipend for his son if he is killed along the way. He has little hope they will return alive, but reasons that he has already outlived most people in his profession, so dying in this manner at least ensures that his son will be provided for. They also <b>take</b> <b>along</b> a mysterious native, Umbopa, who seems more regal, handsome and well-spoken than most porters of his class, but who is very anxious to join the party.|$|E

[...] The recording {{took place in a}} makeshift studio in Room 414 at the Gunter Hotel in San Antonio, Texas, and was produced by Art Satherley and Don Law. [...] It was the second song that Johnson recorded and followed [...] "Kind Hearted Woman Blues". As with most of his recordings, it appears that a second take of the song {{was recorded}} and assigned a reference number.

500|$|Meanwhile, the {{legitimate}} government had relocated to Iași, in besieged Moldavia. Late in 1916, it court-martialled Filitti in absentia, and {{sentenced him to}} death for the crime of high treason. By January 1918, the collapse of Russian forces on the Eastern Front led the Iași administration into negotiating a separate peace with the Central Powers. Germanophile Alexandru Marghiloman took over as Premier, in what seemed to spell a moral victory for the pro-German camp. However, Filitti was drawing closer to the more disgruntled Germanophiles, led by P. P. Carp, who wanted to sign peace on their own terms: [...] "I ask Carp, should he leave to negotiate for Romania, to take me with him. He says that he'll <b>take</b> <b>along</b> his son. I note that one does not exclude the other. He agrees" [...] (January 12, 1918). Filitti was also upset that Marghiloman himself had not yet offered him a high diplomatic post during negotiations over the Buftea-Bucharest Peace Treaty, and noted that the Ententist King, Ferdinand I, [...] "made it hard" [...] {{for him to be}} accepted back into the diplomatic corps. As noted by Georgeta Filitti, Ferdinand vetoed successive proposals to rehire him as public servant.|$|E

2500|$|Moderating Skills makes a {{group leader}} {{understand}} and regulate the unofficial roles assumed {{by all the}} group members during the discussion and use the members to help solve group problems. For example, {{the role of the}} [...] "tension reducer" [...] is to help the members to resolve conflicts and differences in order to reduce anxiety, while the [...] "task master" [...] helps the members to focus [...] on the purpose of the meeting. Group moderators must be mentally alert, listen well, and think quickly in order to have an effective group discussion. All the questions must be memorized and handy for the leader. Concluding the focus group is necessary for the focus group leader {{in order to get a}} formal ending of the session. The leader must thank the group members for participating in the session and summarize what was discussed during the session. S/he should ask if something was missed out in the summary of the session. This helps the group members to have an exact idea of what happened in the session and have something to <b>take</b> <b>along.</b>|$|E
