The laser ignition process of TATB is simulated with three-dimensional finite difference time domain (3 D-FDTD) method to study the electromagnetic field distribution surrounding these defects with 355 [*]nm laser incidence. It indicates that the larger defects in the TATB energetic materials have the stronger electric field modulations to initial incident laser for all the three defects, which is easier to lead to the generation of hot spots. Furthermore, TATB materials with spherical pore defects and crater defects are easier to form hot spots than those with narrow crack defects...|$|E

40|$|A {{small-scale}} characterization test utilizing {{microwave interferometry}} {{was developed to}} dynamically measure detonation and run to detonation distance in explosives. The technique was demonstrated by conducting two experimental series on the well-characterized explosive <b>triaminotrinitrobenzene</b> (TATB). In the first experiment series, the detonation velocity was observed at varying porosity. The velocity during TATB detonation matched well with predictions made using CHEETAH and an empirical relation from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The microwave interferometer also captured unsteady propagation of the reaction when a low density charge was near the failure diameter. In the second experiment series, Pop-plots were produced using data obtained from shock initiation of the TATB through a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) attenuator. The results compared well to wedge test data from LANL despite the microwave interferometer test being of substantially smaller scale. The results showed the test method is attractive for rapid characterization of new and improvised explosive materials. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{assessment}} of {{environmental impacts of}} new munitions {{is an important step}} for maintaining mission readiness in the Army industrial base. During production, waste streams generated may contain small amounts of the energetic material. Knowing how this material may partition in the environment is beneficial to development of waste treatment technologies. Physicochemical parameters define how this partitioning will occur. While these parameters can be experimentally determined once suitable amounts of the energetic material are available for testing, the ability to predict these important properties using the structure of the energetic material will provide a means for assessing their environmental impact during the preliminary development stage. In this work, the chemical structures of six energetic materials are used to estimate their physicochemical parameters. These energetic materials have been identified by researchers at CERL as materials under consideration as energetics in short-term development or longer-term development, and include dinitroanisole (DNAN), n-methylp-nitroaniline (MNA), nitro-triazolene (NTO), <b>triaminotrinitrobenzene</b> (TATB), dinitro pyrazole (DNP) and mtrinitro imidazole (MTNI).

40|$|Components {{made from}} PBX 9502, an {{insensitive}} high explosive formulated with <b>triaminotrinitrobenzene</b> (TATB) and Kel-F 800 binder, {{have been in}} service for nearly two decades. Since that time, samples have been destructively evaluated to determine if potential changes that might affect safety, reliability, or performance {{have occurred in the}} high explosive with time. Data from routine, historical testing is reported elsewhere. This paper focuses on specific tests conducted to evaluate the effects of natural aging on handling sensitivity (through the small-scale tests of Human Electrostatic Discharge, friction, and Drop Weight Impact), compressive strength, and thermal ignition. Also reported are the effects of a radiation environment on TATB. Small-scale sensitivity tests show no differences between aged and unaged material. Observed differences in compressive strength behavior are attributed to conditions of original material rather than aging effects. Thermal ignition by flame and laser methods showed no changes between aged and unaged material. Extreme levels of radiation are shown to have only minimal effects in explosive response tests. PBX 9502 is concluded, once again, to be a very stable material, aging gracefully...|$|E
40|$|Shock {{initiation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important properties of energetic materials, which must transition to detonation exactly as intended when intentionally shocked and not detonate when accidentally shocked. The development of manganin pressure gauges that are placed inside the explosive charge and record the buildup of pressure upon shock impact has greatly increased the knowledge of these reactive flows. This experimental data, together with similar data from electromagnetic particle velocity gauges, has allowed us to formulate the Ignition and Growth model of shock initiation and detonation in hydrodynamic computer codes for predictions of shock initiation scenarios that cannot be tested experimentally. An important problem in shock initiation of solid explosives is the change in sensitivity that occurs upon heating (or cooling). Experimental manganin pressure gauge records and the corresponding Ignition and Growth model calculations are presented for two solid explosives, LX- 17 (92. 5 % <b>triaminotrinitrobenzene</b> (TATB) with 7. 5 % Kel-F binder) and LX- 04 (85 % octahydro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetranitro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetrazine (HMX) with 15 % Viton binder) at several initial temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Diamond anvil cell (DAC) {{studies can}} yield {{information}} about the pressure dependence of materials and reactions under conditions comparable to shock loading. The pressure gradient {{across the face of}} the diamonds is often deliberately minimized to create uniform pressure over much of the sample and a simplified data set. To reach very high pressures (30 - 40 GPa), however, {{it may be necessary to}} use ''softer'', high nitrogen content diamonds that are more susceptible to bending under pressure. The resulting enhanced pressure gradient then provides a view of high-pressure behavior under anisotropic conditions similar to those found at the burn front in a bulk sample. We discuss visual observations of pressure-induced changes relative to variations in burn rate of several explosives (<b>Triaminotrinitrobenzene,</b> Nitromethane, CL- 20) in the DAC. The burn rate behavior of both Nitromethane (NM) and <b>Triaminotrinitrobenzene</b> (TATB) were previously reported for pressures up to {approx} 40 GPa. Nitromethane showed a near monotonic increase in burn rate to a maximum at {approx} 30 GPa after which the burn rate decreased, all without color change. At higher pressures, the TATB samples had shiny (metallic) polycrystalline zones or inclusions where the pressure was highest in the sample. Around the shiny zones was a gradation of color (red to yellow) that appeared to follow the pressure gradient. The color changes are believed related to disturbances in the resonance structure of this explosive as the intermolecular separations decrease with pressure. The color and type of residue found in unvented gaskets after the burn was complete also varied with pressure. The four polymorphs of CL- 20 ({alpha}, {beta}, {gamma}, {var_epsilon}-Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane, HNIW) did not change color up to the highest pressure applied ({approx} 30 GPa), and each polymorph demonstrated a distinctly different burn rate signature. One polymorph {beta} was so sensitive to laser ignition over a narrow pressure range that the sample could not be aligned with a low power laser without ignition. The burn rate for that one polymorph could only be measured at pressures above and below that unique pressure. This anomalous ignition threshold is discussed with respect to the matrix of possible polymorphs, most of which have not been isolated in the laboratory. The changes in behavior, color and reaction rates of all samples are discussed with respect to possible implications to chemistry at high pressure...|$|E
40|$|<b>Triaminotrinitrobenzene</b> (TATB) is {{a highly}} {{anisotropic}} molecular crystal used in several plastic-bonded explosive (PBX) formulations. A complete understanding of the orientation distribution of TATB particles throughout a PBX charge is required to understand spatially variable, anisotropic macroscale properties of the charge. Although texture of these materials can be measured {{after they have been}} subjected to mechanical or thermal loads, measuring texture evolution in situ is important in order to identify mechanisms of crystal deformation and reorientation used to better inform thermomechanical models. Neutron diffraction measurements were used to estimate crystallographic reorientation while deuterated TATB (d-TATB) powder was consolidated into a cylindrical pellet via a uniaxial die-pressing operation at room temperature. Both the final texture of the pressed pellet and the in situ evolution of texture during pressing were measured, showing that the d-TATB grains reorient such that (001) poles become preferentially aligned with the pressing direction. A compaction model is used to predict the evolution of texture in the pellet during the pressing process, finding that the original model overpredicted the texture strength compared to these measurements. The theory was extended to account for initial particle shape and pore space, bringing the results into good agreement with the data...|$|E
40|$|The Ignition & Growth {{model for}} the shock {{initiation}} and detonation of solid explosives is applied to calculating the main features of detonation waves in the <b>triaminotrinitrobenzene</b> (TATB) based high explosives LX- 17, PBX 9502 and EDC- 35. Under detonation conditions, TATB based explosives exhibit reaction zone lengths of 2 to 3 mm depending on the interactions between the detonation wave and the surrounding inert materials. This paper describes comparisons of Ignition & Growth calculations with data from several two- and three-dimensional experiments in which various materials are used to confine the TATB based explosives. The calculated unconfined failure diameters of PBX 9502 are normalized to the measured values at five initial temperatures. Failure diameters for LX- 17 are then estimated by changing only the fraction ignited near the shock front. Fabry-Perot data on spherically divergent LX- 17 “snowball” experiments is also compared to calculations. Calculated detonation velocities, wave front curvatures, and metal acceleration velocities are compared to experimental detonation data for TATB-based high explosives in tantalum, copper, PMMA, brass, and beryllium confinement. Three-dimensional prism failure test results on PBX 9502 are also stimulated using the ALE 3 D code...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Commonly available, nonconventional {{energetic}} {{materials such as}} H 2 O 2, ammonium nitrates (AN), as well as reactive materials (e. g., mixtures of metals and metal oxides), and con-ventional plastic explosives primarily made of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), cyclotrimethyl-ene trinitramine (RDX), cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX), and <b>triaminotrinitrobenzene</b> (TATB), are often materials used in terrorist acts and become threats to homeland security. Thus, characterizing thermochemical properties of these materials at the blast-relevant conditions of pressure, temperature, and composition is critical for developing chemical methods to mitigate the associated threats. In this year, we have completed the investigation of chemical sensitivity of AN and its mixtures with hexane (i. e., ANFO) and aluminum (Ammonal), and made signifi cant progress on main group I peroxides, including Li 2 O 2 and Na 2 O 2 – adding to the previously studied H 2 O 2. The experiments employ diamond anvil cells (DAC), confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy, and third-generation synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The results on both AN and peroxides are signifi cant not only to understanding the fundamental properties of these high-value {{energetic materials}}, but also to gaining insights into what causes chemical sensitivity in energetic materials and fi nding the condi-tions limiting blast or detonation of AN and peroxides...|$|E
40|$|PBX 9502 is a plastic-bonded high {{explosive}} (PBX) containing 95 weight% TATB (<b>triaminotrinitrobenzene)</b> crystals in a polymer binder. TATB crystals are graphitic in nature, with a sheet-like structure and anisotropic CTE. Although the mechanism is not understood, solid-pressed TATB composites {{have been observed}} to undergo irreversible volume change ('ratchet growth') upon thermal cycling. This phenomenon has been studied but many aspects remain elusive and uncharacterized. Engineering or performance changes associated with ratchet growth have often been attributed to changes in density alone. We propose that the density changes which accompany ratchet growth involve a unique form of micro-damage distinguishable from the pore structure associated with low-pressed density. We have performed ratchet growth studies on Recycled PBX 9502 between - 54 to 80 {sup o}C with density changes of about 1. 5 %. Specimens of the same density were obtained using a lower pressure in the manufacturing process. Comparative measurements were made using quasi-static uniaxial tension tests, as well as micro x-ray computed tomography and ultra-small angle neutron scattering experiments. Through these measurements we have shown that ratchet grown PBX 9502 has properties quite different from predictions based on density alone. The pore size distribution of ratchet grown specimens is unique and easily distinguished from parts pressed to an equivalent density...|$|E
