5|$|Njai Dasima was {{directed}} by Bachtiar Effendi for Tan's Film, a production company owned by the Tan brothers. With this {{he became the first}} native Indonesian film director in the Indies. It starred Momo and Oesman. The story was adapted from G. Francis' 1896 novel Tjerita Njai Dasima, which Tan's had already adapted in 1929 with the same name for their first release. The story was already well known in Batavia (now Jakarta), in part because it was a popular part of stage performers' repertoires. To ensure the quality of the story, Effendi worked with a scenario and, later, shooting script– <b>two</b> <b>items</b> which had, until then, never been used for a domestic production.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{validity}} and reliability of three short physical activity self-report instruments to determine their potential for use with university student populations. The participants (N = 155; 44. 5 % male; 22. 9 ± 5. 13 years) wore an accelerometer for 9 consecutive days and completed a single-item measure, the a brief <b>two</b> <b>item</b> measure and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire—Short Form questionnaires on day 1 and 9. Correlations between self-reported and accelerometer derived moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels were moderate for the International Physical Activity Questionnaire—Short Form, while poor for the single-item measure and the a brief <b>two</b> <b>item</b> measure. The agreement level was high with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire—Short Form (77. 4 %) and moderate for both the single-item measure (45. 2 %) and a brief <b>two</b> <b>item</b> measure (44. 5 %). The intraclass correlations between the two administrations were moderate to strong across all measures (0. 52 – 0. 70) in 133 participants. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire—Short Form is the most suitable of these three self-report instruments for use with this population due to higher correlations and levels of agreement with accelerometry...|$|R

40|$|One {{approach}} that has gained popularity for testing unidimensionality within the Rasch measurement framework is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-test based method first proposed by Smith (Smith, 2002). This procedure first identifies <b>two</b> <b>item</b> sets potentially representing different dimensions from a PCA of residuals {{that are used}} to estimate two separate sets of person measures. A series of t-tests is then conducted to compare the two estimates on a person-by-person basis to determine the proportion of instances where the <b>two</b> <b>item</b> sets yield different person measures.

We focus on the parametric case, where both item sizes are bounded from above by 1 k for some natural number k≥ 1. We show that for every possible pair of item sizes, there is an algorithm with competitive ratio of at most (k+ 1) 2 k 2 +k+ 1. We prove that this bound is tight for every k and, moreover, that it cannot be achieved if the <b>two</b> <b>item</b> sizes are not known in advance...|$|R

40|$|The {{area between}} <b>two</b> <b>item</b> {{response}} functions {{is often used}} {{as a measure of}} differential item functioning under item response theory.

Exact and closed-interval measures were estimated on data from a test with embedded items intentionally constructed to favor one group over another. No real differences in detection of these items were found between exact and closed-interval methods.
