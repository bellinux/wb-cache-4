5|$|Extra-pair {{copulation}} with neighbouring birds {{has been}} recorded and may be a reason for adult males {{to stay close to}} the female before and during the egg laying period. Females may sometimes associate with two males and all three help in raising the brood. The typical clutch consists of two eggs which are incubated in turns by both parents. The eggs are brick red with the broad end covered more densely with blotches of red, brown, and black. The parents begin incubating soon after the first egg is laid leading to asynchronous hatching. The first egg hatches after about 42 days. The second chick may hatch <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>days</b> later and a longer delay increases the likelihood that it will die of starvation. In cliffs where the nests are located close to each other, young birds have been known to clamber over to neighbouring nests to obtain food.

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} {{the transmission of}} syphilis can be categorized into those acting {{at the level of}} individuals (e. g., number of sex partners) and others {{at the level of the}} sociophysical environment (e. g., availability of treatment services for curable infections). In a prior study, we identified several sociophysical factors correlated with the ten-year mean syphilis rate in a regression analysis of United States counties. In the present study we used qualitative methods to investigate additional aspects of some factors in the regression, as well as to identify entirely new factors. Twelve counties with populations less than 100, 000 and ten-year mean syphilis rates that were greater or less than expected by the regression model were selected for a <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>day</b> visit. The case study protocol included observations, unstructured interviews with care providers and county residents, and a standardized questionnaire completed by state and local sexually transmitted disease control personnel pertaining to characteristics and practices of the local health department. Comparisons of the field notes and questionnaires revealed patterns of factors of the sociophysical environment that potentially affect county syphilis rates. These included access to the health department STD clinic, race relations, employment opportunities for minorities, interagency coordination, STD outreach activities, the social acceptability of discussing STDs, and intercommunity dynamics. In addition we noted the disproportionate influence of particular individuals on these factors. Some of the factors identified are readily quantifiable and could enhance the predictive power of multivariable models of county syphilis rates. The hypotheses generated by this study may also lead to a better measurement and understanding of potentially important environmental determinants of community syphilis rates, and the development of new or enhanced prevention strategies. ...|$|R

40|$|One {{goal of the}} Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) {{spacecraft}} Operations Planning Center is {{to maintain}} the onboard satellite UTC clock (UTC(MSX)) to within 1 millisecond of UTC(APL) (the program requirement is 10 msec). The UTC(MSX) clock employs as its time base an APL built 5 MHz quartz oscillator, {{which is expected to}} have frequency instabilities (aging rate + drift rate + frequency offset) that will cause the clock to drift approximately two to ten milliseconds per day. The UTC(MSX) clock can be advanced or retarded by the APL MSX satellite ground control center by integer multiples of 1 millisecond. The MSX Operations Planning Center is developing software which records the drift of UTC(MSX) relative to UTC(APL) and which schedules the time of day and magnitude of UTC(MSX) clock updates up to 48 hours in advance. Because of the manner in which MSX spacecraft activities are scheduled, MSX clock updates are planned 24 to 48 hours in advance, and stored in the satellite's computer controller for later execution. Data will be collected on the drift of UTC(MSX) relative to UTC(APL) over a <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>day</b> period. Approximately six times per day, the time offset between UTC(MSX) and UTC(APL) will be measured by APL with a resolution of less than 100 microseconds. From this data a second order analytical model of the clock's drift will be derived. This model will be used to extrapolate the offset of the MSX clock in time from the present to 48 hours in the future. MSX clock updates will be placed on the spacecraft's daily schedule whenever the predicted clock offset exceeds 0. 5 milliseconds. The paper includes a discussion of how the empirical model of the MSX clock is derived from satellite telemetry data, as well as the algorithm used to schedule MSX clock updates based on the model...|$|R

The number of NG2 expressing cells continues to increase for the next <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>days</b> {{and high levels of}} NG2 are seen within seven–ten days of the injury. In vitro studies have been done to demonstrate the effect that NG2 levels play on neurite growth inhibition. Notably, neurons would not adhere to substrates made solely of NG2, which hints at its inhibitory effects on nerve regeneration. When grown on substrates containing both NG2 and adhesive molecules, neurite extension was shown to be reduced by 40-45% when compared to neurite extension on substrates only containing the adhesive molecules. Furthermore, cultures were created with striped surfaces that alternated NG2 lanes with lanes only containing adhesive molecules. Neurons and axons placed on these striped regions consistently stayed in the lanes without NG2. It is clear, then, that the accumulation of NG2 expressing cells at the site of injury creates an extracellular barrier that inhibits axon regrowth into the glial scar area.|$|E

DESIGN [...] Prospective population study with baseline assessment of alcohol intake, smoking habit, income, education, and body mass index, and 10 - 12 years' follow up of mortality. SETTING [...] Copenhagen city heart study, Denmark. SUBJECTS [...] 6051 men and 7234 women aged 30 - 70 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Number and time of cause-specific deaths from 1976 to 1988. RESULTS [...] The risk of dying steadily decreased with an increasing intake of wine [...] from a relative risk of 1. 00 for the subjects who never drank wine to 0. 51 (95 % confidence interval 0. 32 to 0. 81) for those who drank <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> glasses a <b>day.</b> Intake of neither beer nor spirits, however, was associated with reduced risk.

A predictive equation was established to estimate egg mass levels within the field by adult numbers flushed in the grass;An oviposition preference by ECB females was documented for scouted egg mass numbers within hybrid seed fields. ECB females deposited greater numbers of egg masses on the tassled male inbred than on the detassled female inbred. Differences also existed between locations of egg masses on the plant. The majority of egg masses were located on the ear leaf and three leaves below. There was a trend for the male inbred {{to have a greater}} proportion of egg masses above the ear than the female inbred.
