5|$|In Part Three, Henri Christophe {{has become}} the first King of Haiti and {{subjects}} the black population <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> slavery than that experienced under French rule. His regime carries out brutal torture and grips the city in fear. He is later tormented by thunder strikes and magical, ghostly appearances of previously tortured subjects. As the black population revolts against his rule, he finds himself alone and deserted. In this state he commits suicide by shooting himself. His body is taken {{to be buried in}} a fortress on a mountain and this becomes his mausoleum.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Dwight stages {{a fire in}} {{the office}} to test the office's fire safety skills, but things go from bad <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> when Stanley suffers a heart attack, causing Michael to come up with ways to relieve stress in the office, {{including}} a comedic roast of himself. Meanwhile, Andy, Jim, and Pam watch an illegally downloaded movie at work starring Jack Black, Jessica Alba and Cloris Leachman, and Pam deals with her parents' recent argument that's caused her father to move in with her and Jim.|$|E
5|$|Alan Ball the {{previous}} chairman became executive deputy chairman, with Smallpeice requesting a non-executive deputy chairman position, which was quickly agreed to. Sandys and Smallpeice {{were joined by}} a third new board member, the Conservative politician Edward du Cann and the new board constituted in March 1972. The board quickly become concerned at the behaviour of their chief executive Tiny Rowland who had agreed in principle to finance a sugar refinery in Sudan {{at a cost of}} £80 to £100 million, whilst the company {{was in the midst of}} refinancing itself. The board was able to reword the agreement and it became a feasibility study, recovering the situation but respite from a further crisis would prove to be short lived. The situation at Lonrho went from bad <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> during early 1973, when Peats, Lonrho's auditors, discovered payments totalling £44,000 made from a subsidiary company based in the Cayman Islands to Duncan Sandys. Sandys, believing that the payment had been authorised by the board returned in full the money he had received.|$|E

5|$|As 1997 {{turned to}} 1998, an {{inspirational}} performance from Giggs helped a modest United side labour for a hard-earned three points and still maintain {{their desire for}} a fifth title in six seasons. A trip to the Dell to play Southampton – where United were undone last season repeated itself, this time by a solitary Kevin Davies goal in the third minute. The Saints pulled off a valiant performance, most notably from goalkeeper Paul Jones, who denied Solskjær from scoring right at {{the death of the}} second half. Things went from bad <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> in January as Tony Cottee popped in to stun Old Trafford and score the winner for Leicester in what proved a wretched season for the striker. This was the Foxes first win in the league since November and United's first home defeat of the season and fifth altogether.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{momentum}} continued {{one week}} later in Korea, winning his third consecutive race and taking a six-point championship lead as Fernando Alonso finished third. Vettel overcame pole-sitter Mark Webber at the start, and was aided in building up a lead by first-lap contact between Jenson Button, Nico Rosberg and Kamui Kobayashi that saw Button and Rosberg retire with damage from the collision; Rosberg pulled over on the approach to the third turn, forcing a protracted yellow flag period as marshalls attempted to retrieve his car. With the sporting regulations banning overtaking while yellow flags were shown, the field was effectively thinned out in the opening laps as drivers were unable to pass one another. Tyre management {{became the focus of}} the race, as drivers reported heavy graining, particularly on the right-front tyre, which bore most of the load over a lap of the circuit. Vettel ignored six radio calls from his pit wall cautioning him that a tyre failure was imminent, only backing off just enough in the final few laps to secure victory over Webber by six seconds. The team later denied that there had ever been a problem with Vettel's tyres. Further down the order, Scuderia Toro Rosso's Jean-Éric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo fought their way from sixteenth and twenty-first on the grid to finish eighth and ninth, while Romain Grosjean drove a conservative race to finish seventh, having been warned beforehand by the stewards that another first-lap altercation would likely result in his disqualification from the race. Lewis Hamilton's day went from bad <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> when an anti-roll bar on his McLaren failed, while the car handled its tyres so poorly that he was forced to make an unscheduled stop {{in order to make it}} to the finish, only to tear up a length of astroturf that wreaked havoc on his downforce and he slid down to tenth place, narrowly fending off an opportunistic charge from Sergio Pérez to take the final World Championship point on offer. Button's retirement and Hamilton's single point meant that McLaren lost second place in the World Constructors' Championship to Ferrari, and Hamilton admitted that his bid to be the 2012 World Drivers' Champion was over.|$|E

25|$|The Giants {{started off}} {{the regular season}} slow, had spurts of promise but more often {{stretches}} of mediocre <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> play. Pitching was often inconsistent or the offense was non-existent (such as during a pair of 1–0 losses for losing pitcher Matt Cain).|$|E

However, with the tenth ball of the fourth day Chapple dismissed Kabir Ali to end with five for 32, and Warwickshire were all out for 113.|$|E

Chaos narratives, which are rarer in stories about breast cancer, oppose it.|$|E
25|$|Despite these {{positive}} developments, {{the situation}} of Alexandra and her mother didn't improve. Indeed, Greece experiencing a series of military defeats against Turkey and a coup d'état soon forced King Constantine I to abdicate again, this time in favor of Diadochos George, on 27 September 1922. Things went from bad <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> for the country; a further coup forced the new ruler, {{his wife and his}} brother to leave the country on 19 December 1923. On 25 March 1924, the Second Hellenic Republic was proclaimed and both Aspasia and Alexandra were then the only members of the dynasty allowed to stay in Greece.|$|E

25|$|By comparison, {{the most}} {{efficient}} randomized primality test for general integers, the Miller–Rabin primality test, requires O(k n2 log n log log n) bit operations using FFT multiplication for an n-digit number, where k {{is the number of}} iterations and is related to the error rate. For constant k, this is in the same complexity class as the Lucas-Lehmer test. In practice however, the cost of doing many iterations and other differences leads <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> performance for Miller–Rabin. The most efficient deterministic primality test for any n-digit number, the AKS primality test, requires Õ(n6) bit operations in its best known variant and is dramatically slower in practice.|$|E
25|$|After {{a disappointing}} NAB Cup campaign, which {{included}} a loss to the newly formed GWS Giants, the Suns were woeful in their first round loss to the Adelaide Crows. Losses continued to pile as the Gold Cost fell to St Kilda and Essendon before suffering another loss in QClash3. The season went from bad <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> when Gary Ablett went down injured in the clash with Brisbane. In the absence of Ablett, a silvering lining was discovered by the club during their next two losses as Harley Bennell's talent was unearthed. Bennell {{caught the attention of}} the media after a 37 possession game against Fremantle in Round 6.|$|E
25|$|Research shows mixed {{findings}} {{on the effect of}} smoking on prospective memory, but more evidence is in favour of smoking diminishing prospective memory performance. Self-reported measures such as the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) have reported no difference between smokers and non-smokers; however, results from prospective memory tasks have suggested otherwise. Tasks are more objective as they eliminate subjective biases which can occur on the PRMQ. A study by Heffernan et al. (2010) suggested that persistent smoking is associated with prospective memory decrements and the impact of nicotine on long-term prospective memory may be dose dependent. Greater amounts of smoking lead <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> prospective memory performance.|$|E
