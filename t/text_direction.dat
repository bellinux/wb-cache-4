At first it was an experimental project, but in few months it gathered few hundred passionate users and started to receive attention from the Israeli Media.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{elements}} {{take the}} language-related attribute [...] to specify <b>text</b> <b>direction,</b> such as with [...] "rtl" [...] for right-to-left text in, for example, Arabic, Persian or Hebrew.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, the Middle Eastern {{version has}} only English and French user interfaces, but with its option {{to change the}} <b>text</b> <b>direction</b> to right-to-left, it does support Arabic and Hebrew data entry.|$|E

50|$|Layout shapes {{were the}} most elaborate. These could be divided into {{multiple}} runs with different font styles, even different language encodings and <b>text</b> <b>directions.</b> Thus, {{it was possible to}} embed a sequence of Arabic text, rendered right-to-left, within an outer sequence of left-to-right Roman text. Layout shapes unleashed the full power of contextual substitutions, kerning, variations and all the other capabilities of TrueType GX fonts. Their main restriction was that they were confined to a single line of text.|$|R

40|$|For {{document}} images {{captured by}} a digital camera, perspective and geometric distortions {{make it hard}} to recognize the document content properly. In this paper, we propose an integrated document restoration technique, which is capable of removing perspective and geometric distortions, and producing a flattened and fronto-parallel text image that is friendly to the generic OCR systems. The proposed document restoration is accomplished through grid modeling, which divides camera images into multiple quadrilateral grids using vertical <b>text</b> <b>directions</b> and the x lines and base lines. The global distortions are then removed through grid regularization that transforms the quadrilateral grids together with the pixel contents to the regular square grids. Experimental results show the proposed method is fast and easy for implementation. ...|$|R

For Tempest in a Teapot, commissioned by the Dutch Music Days for the Radio Kamer Philharmonic, the orchestra is spatialized around the public.

50|$|The oldest {{classical}} Greek and Latin writing {{had little}} or no space between words and could be written in boustrophedon (alternating directions). Over time, <b>text</b> <b>direction</b> (left to right) became standardized, and word dividers and terminal punctuation became common. The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original paragraphos, similar to an underscore {{at the beginning of the}} new group. The Greek paragraphos evolved into the pilcrow (¶), which in English manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline between sentences. The hedera leaf (e.g. ☙) has also been used in the same way.|$|E
50|$|The N-terminus (also {{known as}} the amino-terminus, NH2-terminus, N-terminal end or amine-terminus) {{is the start of}} a protein or {{polypeptide}} referring to the free amine group (-NH2) located {{at the end of a}} polypeptide. Normally the amine group is bonded to another carboxylic group in a protein to make it a chain, but since the end of a protein has only 1 out of 2 areas chained, the free amine group is referred to the N-terminus. By convention, peptide sequences are written N-terminus to C-terminus, left to right in LTR languages. This correlates the translation direction to the <b>text</b> <b>direction</b> (because when a protein is translated from messenger RNA, it is created from N-terminus to C-terminus - amino acids are added to the carbonyl end).|$|E

40|$|Text {{detection}} {{in video}} images has received increasing attention, particularly in scene text detection in video images, as it plays {{a vital role}} in video indexing and information retrieval. This paper proposes a new and robust gradient difference technique for detecting both graphics and scene text in video images. The technique introduces the concept of zero crossing to determine the bounding boxes for the detected text lines in video images, rather than using the conventional projection profiles based method which fails to fix bounding boxes when there is no proper spacing between the detected text lines. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed technique by conducting experiments on video images containing both graphics text and scene text with different font shapes and sizes, languages, <b>text</b> <b>directions,</b> background and contrasts. Our experimental results show that the proposed technique outperforms existing methods in terms of detection rate for large video image database. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study {{reported}} here was to examine whether age and spatial ability are factors that influence a driver's ability to navigate and to use navigational displays. These factors were examined because previous research suggests that spatial ability may underlie navigational performance, including route-following and mapreading, and that these skills may diminish with age. Thus, older drivers and drivers with weak navigational skills, may have a heightened need for, and be particularly served by, in-vehicle route guidance displays found in Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS). A total of 56 drivers were tested on spatial ability. The drivers then performed a navigational task in a part-task driving simulator using different navigational aids, including: (1) <b>text</b> <b>directions,</b> (2) an enlarged, mounted paper map, (3) a standard-scale paper map, and (4) a turn-by-turn route guidance ATIS display. The major findings were that: (1) older drivers showed worse navigational pe [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} for text line {{formation}} for text localization and recognition is proposed. The method exhaustively enumerates short sequences of character regions {{in order to}} infer values of hidden text line parameters (such as <b>text</b> <b>direction)</b> and ap-plies the parameters to efficiently limit the search space for longer sequences. The exhaustive enumer-ation of short sequences is achieved by finding all character region triplets that fulfill constraints of tex-tual content, which keeps the proposed method effi-cient yet still capable to perform a robust estimation of the hidden parameters in order to correctly initial-ize the search. The method is applied to character regions which are detected as Maximally Stable Ex-tremal Regions (MSERs). The performance of the method is evaluated on the standard ICDAR 2003 dataset, where the method outperforms (precision 0. 60, recall 0. 60) a previ-ously published method for text line formation of MSERs. 1...|$|E
