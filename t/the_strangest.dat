5|$|During {{the course}} of the thirteenth century, the Bilwis is less and less {{frequently}} treated as the personification of a supernatural power but becomes increasingly identified as a malevolent human being, a witch. Still later, with the rise of the witch persecution {{at the end of the}} Middle Ages, the Bilwis was demonized; she becomes an incarnation of the devil for the witch and sorcerer. A final development has taken place since the sixteenth century, especially in northeast Germany, the Bilwis has been conceived of as a grain spirit bringing wealth; yet this latest manifestation of the Bilwis has its harmful side, the Bilwis-cutter, who is blamed for the unexplained patterns that are formed among the rows of standing grain. The cutter is a sorcerer or witch that cuts down the corn with sickles that are fastened to its feet. He is classified as an essentially malevolent Corn Spirit. Thus, the Bilwis is exceedingly polymorphous, taking on many appearances and meaning in all German-speaking areas throughout the Middle Ages. The Bilwis is one of <b>the</b> <b>strangest</b> and most mysterious beings in all folklore; its varying forms reflect the concerns of a farm culture, and it serves to explain the eerie appearance of turned-down rows of plants in cornfields.|$|E

25|$|During {{the night}} of September 25, the fire emitted was quite {{extraordinary}} and accompanied by terrifying rumblings. <b>The</b> <b>strangest</b> thing was, that within the black column of smoke issuing from the volcano ever since June 2, there frequently formed thunderstorms, and it happened that the huge tempest cloud would scarcely ever disappear during two months.|$|E

One hypothesis suggests that Miranda might consist of a reaggregation of material following an earlier event when Miranda was shattered into pieces by a violent impact.|$|E

It has the colour of a very old violin. Its handle is so pliable that it can be twisted in all directions. It must have seen its best days when its owner was a little boy at school. It has been a scrap-heap job for years. But Iverson seldom places much strain upon it.|$|E

25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>strangest</b> {{moments in}} Zakharov's career {{occurred}} in late 1990, when, {{as a member}} of the parliamentary Australian Security Intelligence Organisation committee, she was given access to her own intelligence file. She was not surprised to discover that ASIO had shown interest in her membership of the Communist Party while at university; what she was not prepared for was a detailed investigation the organisation had made in 1963, after becoming concerned that John Zakharov was a bigamist. A less-than-impressed Zakharov speculated at the time that the contents of her file may have cost her at least one public service position during the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the five}} living species of monotreme occur in Australia: the platypus and the short-beaked echidna. The {{monotremes}} differ from other mammals in their methods of reproduction; in particular, they lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. The platypusa venomous, egg-laying, duck-billed amphibious mammalis considered {{to be one of}} <b>the</b> <b>strangest</b> creatures in the animal kingdom. When it was first presented by Joseph Banks to English naturalists it was thought to be so strange that it was a cleverly created hoax. The short-beaked echidna is similarly strange, covered in hairy spikes with a tubular snout in the place of a mouth, and a tongue that can move {{in and out of the}} snout about 100 times a minute to capture termites.|$|E
25|$|As {{suddenly}} as they appeared, the tourists vanish. The fugitive {{returns to the}} museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence. He attributes the experience to a hallucination caused by food poisoning, but the tourists reappear that night. They {{have come out of}} nowhere and yet they talk as if they have been there for a while. He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when the heat is unbearable. <b>The</b> <b>strangest</b> thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E

25|$|For {{the dual}} roles of Arctor and Fred, Linklater thought of Keanu Reeves, but figured that the actor would be burnt out from making another science fiction film after making The Matrix trilogy. Robert Downey, Jr. was {{attracted}} to the film when he heard Reeves was going to star and Linklater to direct. He thought that the script was <b>the</b> <b>strangest</b> one he had ever read. Linklater wrote the role of Freck with Rory Cochrane in mind. The actor was interested but {{did not want to}} recreate his role in Dazed and Confused. Both Woody Harrelson and Winona Ryder agreed to appear in the film based on the script. Reeves and Ryder agreed to work for the Screen Actors Guild scale rate plus any back-end profits. As with Linklater's earlier Waking Life, syndicated radio host Alex Jones has a small cameo as himself.|$|E
25|$|On Hesselberg {{all forms}} (high forest, coppice-with-standards, coppice) and types (temperate {{coniferous}} forest, mixed forest, deciduous forest) of forests can be found. The coppice {{in the upper}} regions of the northern slope has <b>the</b> <b>strangest</b> appearance. After coppicing more light reaches the ground and thermophile animals such as the sand lizard thrive. Later, when the canopy closes again, many other specialised animals such as the Eurasian woodcock find a suitable habitat. All game that is typical of German forests (for example hare, roe, red fox, and squirrel) are present in Hesselberg's woods. The drumming of woodpeckers and the crying of cuckoos contribute to {{the mood of the}} wood as well as the singing of countless birds. Various Ranunculaceae‚Äîsuch as liverworts and wood anemones‚Äîare the signs of spring in Hesselberg's forests. In May ramsons turn the ground of the deciduous forest into a carpet of green and white blooms. After blooming the intense odour of garlic fills the air. The various species of orchids such as the red helleborine have become increasingly rare. The Turk's-cap lily, which belongs to the lily family, can still be found relatively often but flower's diversity is in need of protection. The erica and the Cytisus scoparius prefer the iron sandstone layers of the lower parts of the slopes.|$|E

40|$|The {{findings}} of a study into the feasibility of placing experimental constraints on a hypothetical asymmetry in <b>the</b> <b>strange</b> component of <b>the</b> proton sea, and on <b>the</b> <b>strange</b> components as a whole, at ATLAS are presented here. <b>The</b> <b>strange</b> and antistrange components of the proton sea (collectively known as the "strange sea") are generally assumed to be charge-symmetric, however {{the possibility of an}} asymmetric strange sea is indicated in theory and experiment, making this an interesting area for study in data. <b>The</b> <b>strange</b> component of <b>the</b> hadron sea at low values of x is not well constrained in data, and a measurement placing stronger limits on this will be vital in enabling Standard Model and beyond-Standard Model physics to be distinguished at the LHC. This Monte Carlo study addresses {{the question of whether the}} current limits on <b>the</b> <b>strange</b> sea could be improved using the ATLAS experiment, and whether if an asymmetry exists in <b>the</b> <b>strange</b> sea it is likely to be detectable at ATLAS. This study was performed using approximately 1 fb 1 of simulated data. It was found that it will not be possible to measure properties of <b>the</b> <b>strange</b> sea in one inverse femtobarn of data. It is indicated that new limits on <b>the</b> <b>strange</b> component of <b>the</b> sea, and a possible measurement of a strange sea asymmetry, are feasible with around 300 inverse femtobarns of data provided that the levels of certain background channels with large cross-sections (n amely cc and bb backgrounds) could be convincingly shown to be controlled in further, higher-volume studies with data and Monte Carlo...|$|R
