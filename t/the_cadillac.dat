5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cadillac</b> Converj is a plug-in hybrid {{concept car}} first {{unveiled}} at the 2009 North American International Auto Show which incorporated the propulsion {{system from the}} Chevrolet Volt, including the Voltec powertrain. In August 2011, General Motors announced its decision to produce the Converj as <b>the</b> <b>Cadillac</b> ELR. The first 2014 ELRs rolled off the production line in late May 2013. These were pre-production units destined for testing purposes and production for retail customers started {{at the end of}} 2013. The ELR was released to retail customers in the U.S. in December 2013.|$|E

5|$|Past <b>the</b> <b>Cadillac</b> area, M-115 {{runs through}} the northeastern corner of the Manistee National Forest. The highway {{continues}} through woodlands, passing several small lakes in the area as it approaches the community of Mesick. There it turns due west and joins M-37 through town. After M-37 separates to the south, M-115 crosses the Manistee River and continues its northwestern course. The highway crosses the northeastern corner of Manistee County and {{runs through the}} community of Copemish {{on the way to}} Benzonia. The landscape here turns more agricultural as the highway skirts southwest of Thompsonville crossing the Betsie River.|$|E

5|$|The last gravel {{segments}} were paved in Iosco County in {{the late}} 1950s. Another segment east of Cadillac to M-66 south of Lake City was realigned in 1973. At the same time, M-55 was co-signed with {{a portion of the}} newly opened stretch of I-75 between M-157 and West Branch. The last routing change was made in November 2000 when the southern segment of <b>the</b> <b>Cadillac</b> bypass was opened. M-55 was moved out of downtown Cadillac and along the freeway and M-115. US131 joined M-55 on the bypass the next October when the northern half of the bypass was completed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|VAT {{could offer}} only petrol engines until 1953. The most common ones were the Hercules engines made {{domestically}} under licence by SAT and Tampella. The SAT-made engine {{was called the}} Sisu AMG or SA5, and the engine made by Tampella was the Tampella 6000. The second most common engine was <b>the</b> <b>Cadillac</b> V8 1G and the third was the White 160 AX, which Kytölä had bought from Central Europe. Some Bedford petrol engines were used in Defence Forces lorries in the 1960s and Ford V8 engines were used for fire engines. The first diesel Vanajas were powered by Saurer and Kämper engines. The vast majority of diesel engines were supplied by Leyland and AEC. A few Vanajas were equipped with the Perkins R6 or the Ford Trader 510E. In some cases, the engine {{was provided by the}} customer; one Vanaja was powered by a Mercedes-Benz diesel engine.|$|E
5|$|While the {{original}} touring cast intended {{to play a}} limited engagement from April 29 to June 12, 2005 at the Oriental Theatre in Chicago, producers decided to extend it to an open-ended run, making it the first non-Broadway sit-down production of Wicked. Opening at the same Chicago theatre {{the day after the}} touring production had finished, {{the original}} Chicago cast included Ana Gasteyer as Elphaba, Kate Reinders as Glinda, Rondi Reed as Madame Morrible, Kristoffer Cusick as Fiyero, Telly Leung as Boq, Heidi Kettenring as Nessarose and Gene Weygandt as the Wizard. The production closed on January 25, 2009, after over 1,500 performances. The touring production returned to Chicago for a special engagement at <b>the</b> <b>Cadillac</b> Palace Theatre from December 1, 2010 to January 23, 2011. In celebration of the musical's 10th anniversary, the tour played an eight-week return engagement, returning to the Oriental Theatre, from October 30 through December 21, 2013.|$|E

25|$|In 1967, Cadillac adopted its {{own version}} of the UPP for <b>the</b> <b>Cadillac</b> Eldorado, using <b>the</b> <b>Cadillac</b> V8 engine. The Eldorado also shared the basic E-body shell with the Toronado and Riviera, but its radically {{different}} styling meant that the three cars did not look at all similar.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, <b>the</b> <b>Cadillac</b> Club formed, the {{forerunner of}} <b>the</b> <b>Cadillac</b> Area Chamber of Commerce. Gradually, various {{manufacturing}} firms found success in Cadillac. By the early 20th century, with the lumber depleted, the timber industry was in decline. Industrial development soon dominated the local economy, {{and it continues to}} do so today. Cadillac's range of industries includes the manufacture of pleasure boats, automotive parts, water-well components, vacuum cleaners, and rubber products.|$|E

25|$|The Great Depression sapped {{the auto}} {{industry}} generally, with the luxury market declining more steeply; between 1928 and 1933, Cadillac sales had declined by 84%, to 6,736 vehicles. Exacerbating sales performance for <b>the</b> <b>Cadillac</b> brand was a policy, reflective of the times, which discouraged sales to African Americans. Nick Dreystadt, mechanic and national head of Cadillac service, urged a committee – set up to decide whether <b>the</b> <b>Cadillac</b> brand would live on – to revoke that policy. After the policy was eliminated, brand sales increased by 70% in 1934 – and Dreystadt was promoted to lead the entire Cadillac Division.|$|E

25|$|Development of {{automotive}} technology was rapid, {{due in part}} to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included electric ignition and the electric self-starter (both by Charles Kettering, for <b>the</b> <b>Cadillac</b> Motor Company in 1910–1911), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes.|$|E
