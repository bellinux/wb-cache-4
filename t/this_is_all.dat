5|$|A Jiva (being) {{immersed}} in Maya (changing reality, illusive world) craves for worldly greed, performs karoti (Sanskrit: करोति, ritual works), enjoys bodily pleasures like women, food, drink and pleasures. This, states the text, gives him satisfaction in his wakeful state, in dream as he sleeps his soul fashions a dream world of joys and nightmares, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> deception. True bliss, states the text, {{comes in the}} third state of consciousness. It is, states the text, the third state, everything comes to rest, in whole, in peace, in bliss.|$|E
5|$|Syro {{placed on}} the mid-week UK Albums Chart at number 2, selling 9,000copies less than <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>All</b> Yours by alt-J. It {{subsequently}} debuted at number 8on the weekly chart, selling 17,751copies in its first week of release. Syro is James' first album {{to reach the top}} 10in the chart, and his highest peaking album in the UK to date; Selected Ambient Works Volume II had previously peaked at number 11in March 1994. Syro also appeared on four other British charts; it placed at number 2on the Independent Albums Chart and number 7on the Scottish Albums Chart, as well as reaching number 1on both the Dance Albums and Official Record Store Albums charts.|$|E

25|$|The {{woman that}} helps hide the runaway, presumably a prostitute (the woman), changes in appearance. The runaway's hood is {{alternately}} flipped {{up and down}} and the dog that runs with her might also be different in different scenes. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> to signify that the runaway has escaped many times before.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> very {{different}} from smaller shogi variants, where pieces promote when they cross a promotion zone (the enemy camp), and where promotion is optional. The dots on the taikyoku shogi board that would represent promotion zones in other games are only there as placement guides for the initial setup of the two camps.|$|E

25|$|Sumerian {{metallurgy}} and goldsmithing {{were highly}} developed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> {{the more remarkable}} for a region where metals had to be imported. Known metals included gold, gold, silver, copper, bronze, lead, electrum, and tin. The use of binary, tertiary and quaternary alloys were already in use during the Uruk period. Sumerians used bronze, although the scarcity of tin meant that they used arsenic instead. Metalworking techniques included lost-wax casting, plating, filigree, and granulation.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi {{solidified}} {{his position}} of temporary intervention, {{saying he would}} not send Ethiopian military units into the Somali capital, Mogadishu, but encircle the city instead so as to contain the ICU. A government spokesman appeared to offhandedly conflict with this statement however, by saying of the ICU retreat: ‘This is {{the first stage of}} victory… When <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> over, we will enter Mogadishu peacefully.’ Ethiopian bombings continued, with three people killed in Leego, east of Burhakaba.|$|E
25|$|The band's {{debut album}} An Awesome Wave was {{released}} in May 2012 in Europe, and in September 2012 in the United States, and won the 2012 British Mercury Prize. Gwil Sainsbury amicably departed the band in early 2014. Their second album, <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>All</b> Yours, was released on 22 September 2014 and went straight to UK number one. As a replacement for Sainsbury, Cameron Knight became a supporting member for alt-J's live shows, playing guitar, bass and sampler. In 2017, the band released their third studio album, Relaxer, and are currently playing as a trio.|$|E

25|$|In the {{relatively}} small and geographically dispersed Canadian market, magazines producing long-form journalism have often struggled to stay afloat. Saturday Night, which The Walrus editor John Macfarlane formerly published, lost money continuously despite being a celebrated publication. But as Macfarlane reports, The Walruss charitable model, {{similar to that of}} Harper's, is so far sustaining it: donations covered about half of the costs of producing the magazine in 2010, with the traditional revenue streams of circulation and advertising providing the rest. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> the more important for the magazine because its educational mandate requires that it keep a ratio of no less than 70 percent editorial content to 30 percent advertising.|$|E
25|$|Gardens and {{gardening}} have {{a special}} place in Singaporean culture as well as in politics. Historically <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> officially attributed to Lee Kuan Yew who apparently spearheaded this philosophy in 1963. In a rare interview with Monty Don shown in the TV-series Around the World in 80 Gardens, Lee Kuan Yew reveals that after visits to other big Asian cities such as Hong Kong and Bangkok he feared that Singapore would turn into another concrete jungle, and he decided that gardens and parks should be established everywhere and made this a priority of the government.|$|E
25|$|Absent the use {{of trade}} to access resources, {{economic}} transactions were essentially intra-lineage obligations of labor. These lineages required a base level of self-sufficiency to achieve autarky. In the Andes, a long mountain range with {{a great variety of}} ecozones and resources, the need to access the proper lands for specific crops or animals meant lineages created miniature colonies or sent seasonal migration (such as transhumance) in different ecoregions. As the Andes are a relatively young mountain range, there is an especially great variation in waterfall and temperature, which has great importance for agriculture. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> the more important as only about 2% of the land in the Andes is arable.|$|E

25|$|The strong anthropic {{principle}} (SAP) as explained by John D. Barrow and Frank Tipler states that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> {{the case because}} the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life emerge within it. Some critics of the SAP argue {{in favor of a}} weak {{anthropic principle}} (WAP) similar to the one defined by Brandon Carter, which states that the universe's ostensible fine tuning is the result of selection bias (specifically survivor bias): i.e., only in a universe capable of eventually supporting life will there be living beings capable of observing and reflecting upon fine tuning. Most often such arguments draw upon some notion of the multiverse for there to be a statistical population of universes to select from and from which selection bias (our observance of only this universe, compatible with our life) could occur.|$|E
25|$|On it, {{there will}} be such {{information}} as the contact person’s name, address, and phone number, a proposed scenario for the crime and, all relevant details on the crime scene, {{as well as the}} last time the deceased was seen alive; as you recall, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> information found in the initial contact notes. Other relevant information is a list of all evidence collected, including specimens and all identification and rearing procedures performed, a PMI estimate, and a summarized conclusion based on all the findings. Copies of this report are submitted to the contact officer, the forensic entomologist, and as a courtesy, to the medical examiner. If throughout the course of the investigation, any manipulation of the specimens occurred (i.e. dissecting, rearing, then a copy of the specimen disposition and identification form should also be included in the report).|$|E
25|$|Dido and Aeneas are {{accompanied}} by their train. They stop at the grove to take in its beauty. A lot of action is going on, with attendants carrying goods from the hunt and a picnic possibly taking place, and Dido and Aeneas are together within the activity. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> stopped when Dido hears distant thunder, prompting Belinda to tell the servants {{to prepare for a}} return to shelter as soon as possible. As every other character leaves the stage, Aeneas is stopped by the Sorceress's elf, who is disguised as Mercury. This pretend Mercury brings the command of Jove that Aeneas is to wait no longer in beginning his task of creating a new Troy on Latin soil. Aeneas consents to the wishes of what he believes are the gods, but is heart-broken that he will have to leave Dido. He then goes off-stage to prepare for his departure from Carthage.|$|E
