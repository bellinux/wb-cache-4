25|$|Several factors {{affect the}} feminization of poverty, and these factors place women {{at high risk}} of poverty. Multiple factors {{contribute}} to women’s economic insecurity, including the gender wage gap, women’s prevalence in low-paid occupations, a lack of work-family supports, and the challenges involved in accessing public benefits. Though low income is the major cause, there are many interrelated facets of this problem. Lone mothers are usually at the highest risk for extreme poverty because their income is insufficient to rear children. It then lowers their children's possibilities for good education and nourishment. Low income is a consequence of the social bias women face in trying to obtain formal employment, which in turn deepens <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty.</b> As the number of women in poverty increases, the diverse causes affecting their poverty must be examined. Poverty is multidimensional, and therefore economic, demographic, and socio-cultural factors all overlap and contribute to the establishment of poverty. It is a phenomenon with multiple root causes and manifestations.|$|E

2500|$|Homelessness has a {{tremendous}} effect on a child's education.

This act is supposed to break down the barriers homeless students have to receiving an education. These barriers include residency restriction, medical record verification, and transportation issues. Once a student surpasses these barriers, they are still subject to the stigma of being homeless, and the humiliation they feel because of their situation. Some families do not report their homelessness, while others are unaware of the opportunities available to them. Many report that maintaining a stable school environment helps the students because it's the only thing that remains normal. Many homeless students fall behind their peers in school due to behavioral disorders, and lack of attendance in school.|$|E

2500|$|Women's {{choice to}} {{identify}} with a particular religious sect or creed can negatively affect {{their participation in the}} labor market, thus leading to the feminization of poverty. This conclusion is supported by a 2004 report by the Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research that found that Muslim women were more likely to work part-time jobs than Muslim men because of their religion's emphasis on the role of women as caregivers and housekeepers. The study found that these {{women are more likely to}} be financially dependent than men because of their choice of decreased participation in the labor market. [...] High levels of financial dependency among women is not unique to the Islamic faith, according to Raphael Cohen-Almagor in a 2016 report, Jewish women are also considered to be household providers rather than breadwinners within the tradition of Halachic law. The report highlights this point by referencing the Jewish text, the Mishnah and pulling out lines such as , [...] "she should [...] fill for him his cup, make ready his bed and wash his face, hands and feet," [...] when describing the role of women under Jewish law. [...] The Christian faith also regards women as more demure and family-oriented than men. [...] For this reason, women in certain sects of Christianity, namely Pentecostal women, are often forced to leave their faith traditions in order to escape <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> bred by their religion's view of women.|$|E
2500|$|Redlining {{is related}} to {{steering}} because it is denying financial support and services to neighborhoods based on race, ethnicity, or economic status. Rather than subtly steering individual families towards certain areas or only giving them information on certain racial areas, redlining was a blatant but legally tolerated criterion for financial institutions to decide where to invest. Originating in the New Deal, this procedure was a protocol for deciding where federal, state and city funds would go for financial services. Affluent middle- and upper-middle-class white areas were outlined in green on a map, meaning that financial services were clear to be rendered and these areas were desirable for investment. [...] Racial areas, specifically African-American neighborhoods, were outlined in red, meaning they were undesirable neighborhood whose denizens were poor and racially mixed. These maps were used by banking institutions to construct guidelines for lending money. As a consequence, many of these redlined areas, which were also typically located in urban environments as whites tended to move out to the suburbs of America, experienced deterioration on a rapid scale. Since these areas have been neglected and redlined and cannot receive funds from banks to revitalize, they cannot attract businesses, which perpetuates <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty.</b> The poverty often leads to crime, and neighborhoods become further neglected because {{they continue to be}} unattractive to outside investment, and continue to be redlined by banks. Thus private banks and financial institutions as well as the U.S. government are accused of being responsible for these practices in several instances, which before the Fair Housing Act were widespread and blatant throughout the United States. [...] Redlining is still practiced today on a more subtle level. Instead of having official maps circulated to institutions, which is illegal, the public domain may tend to ignore poor neighborhoods by denying basic public services.|$|E
