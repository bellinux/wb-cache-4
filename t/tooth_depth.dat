25|$|Hobbing uses a {{hobbing machine}} with two skew spindles, one mounted {{with a blank}} {{workpiece}} {{and the other with}} the hob. The angle between the hob's spindle (axis) and the workpiece's spindle varies, {{depending on the type of}} product being produced. For example, if a spur gear is being produced, then the hob is angled equal to the helix angle of the hob; if a helical gear is being produced then the angle must be increased by the same amount as the helix angle of the helical gear. The two shafts are rotated at a proportional ratio, which determines the number of teeth on the blank; for example, for a single-threaded hob if the gear ratio is 40:1 the hob rotates 40 times to each turn of the blank, which produces 40 teeth in the blank. If the hob has multiple threads the speed ratio must be multiplied by the number of threads on the hob.

The characteristics of the segmented chip produced by laser-assisted machining (LAM) {{in terms of the}} <b>tooth</b> <b>depth</b> and tooth spacing were strongly dependent on the cutting speed and laser power. Two types of segmented chip formation processes were observed, one at low and the other at high cutting speeds with a continuous chip occurring between these two types of segmented chips. The critical cutting speed at which the transition from the sharp, segmented chip to the continuous chip occurred increased with laser power. To obtain the continuous chip, plastic deformation at the shear zone to match the deformation strain introduced by the cutting tool is required.

Abundant C. meniscioides fossils at different development stages buried together in a single, thick bed of sheet-flood deposits provide evidence for the species having formed large, pure colonies in open, disturbed floodplain areas.

40|$|Micro {{features}} {{with high}} aspect ratios {{are one of}} the commonly encountered geometries found in micro products. In the literature, these structures are often used in demonstrator products machined by a micromilling process. In this paper, the challenges in micromilling thin ribs ith high aspect ratios have been studied. Due to the scaling effect, micro-ribs have relatively low stiffness but high natural frequency. Therefore, on the one hand, average forces have to be controlled well to avoid structural bending or even damage, while on the other hand, micro features are unlikely to be excited by the dynamic forces. The characteristics of micromilling forces and their relationships to the machining parameters, namely, feed per <b>tooth,</b> <b>depth</b> of cut and width of cut, were studied theoretically by force models. In addition, the effects of different milling strategies (up-/down-milling) and tool paths on the quality of thin features have been investigated using FEM. The results allow measures to be taken to minimize the force effects and support the micro features during machining. The experimental results verify the theoretical studies.

Its movement form is equivalent to a pair of gears transmission which the surface of the gear-honing-tool is adhered a layer of grinding grain. When it works in rolling processing, the contact-point between the workpiece and gear-honing-tool is moving. Then the moving point becomes a line in the space, and with the gear-honing-tool being in axial play, a standard flank of tooth is finished. Using the gear meshing principle, kinematics model of relative sliding velocity in the contact- point between the workpiece and tools is established, based on which the contact-line equation. and acceleration equation. at the contact-point are derived. The contact-line is solved in a given parameters of the workpiece and tool in MATLAB.

No segundo estudo foi avaliada a influência da aplicação prévia de agente dessensibilizante, fluoreto de sódio 2 % e nitrato de potássio 5 % associado ao fluoreto de sódio 2 % e, sem agente dessensibilizante (controle) na eficácia do clareamento dental com PH 35 %. Nos dois estudos foram usados fragmentos dentais bovinos, pigmentados por chá preto, e distribuídos por esquema inteiramente casual no primeiro estudo e aleatório por sorteio no segundo estudo (n= 10) em grupos de acordo com os tratamentos acima. As amostras foram armazenadas em saliva {{artificial}} durante as 3 semanas de tratamento. As leituras de cor da dentina oposta (1, 75 mm de espessura) do estudo 1 e as leituras de cor do esmalte (1, 0 mm de espessura) e dentina oposta (1, 75 mm de espessura) do estudo 2 foram realizadas após o manchamento (baseline) e após cada semana de tratamento clareador, utilizando o método CIE Lab através de espectrofotômetro (Konica Minolta CM 700 d, Japan). Para o estudo 1 os valores de ?E, ?L, ?a e ?b datados foram submetidos à análise de variância ANOVA em esquema fatorial e teste de Tukey (?= 0, 05).

This project was divided into two studies. Firstly, we tested the influence of enamel thickness (0. 5 mm thick, 1. 0 mm planned thick, 1. 0 mm unplanned thick and absence of enamel - control) on the effectiveness of bleaching, in-depth, according to the type of bleaching agent, as follows: 10 % carbamide peroxide and 35 % hydrogen peroxide. Secondly, we evaluated the influence of prior application of a desensitizing agent (potassium nitrate associated with 2 % sodium fluoride, 2 % neutral fluoride, or with no desensitizing agent - control) on the effectiveness of tooth bleaching by using 35 % hydrogen peroxide. In both studies we used bovine teeth fragments, stained with black tea, which were allocated into groups according to the aforementioned treatments, by an entirely causal scheme for the first study and by random drawing for the second one (n= 10). The specimens were stored in artificial saliva during the 3 -week-treatment. Color readings of the underlying dentin (1. 75 mm thick) concerning the study 1, and color readings of enamel (1. 0 mm thick) and underlying dentin (1. 75 mm thick) of the study 2, were performed after staining (baseline) and after each week of bleaching treatment using the CIE Lab method by means of spectrophotometer (Konica Minolta CM 700 d, Japan). For the study 1, the values of ?E, ?L, ?a and ?b recorded were subjected to factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test (? = 0. 05). For the study 2, the coordinate L* recorded (L = 100 - lightness, L = 0 - darkness) was submitted to analysis of repeated measures PROC MIXED and Tukey-Kramer's test, and the ? values registered underwent analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test (? = 0. 05). The enamel of 2 specimens from each group of the study 2 was observed under scanning electron microscopy. According to the findings, it could be observed that the bleaching with 10 % CP was more effective than that with 35 % PH as regards dentin depth for all parameters delta, except the third time deltas.

These mathematical models become extremely complicated when considering machining of a spherical or a non-analytical surface. This paper presents a parametric model built in a CAD environment that determines the shape of the undetached chip when machining a spherical zone with a torodial end mill...|$|R
40|$|The robust {{design of}} flank milling {{parameters}} {{is dealing with}} the optimization of the cutting loads, milled surface roughness and the material removal rate (MRR) in the machining of an Al-alloy casting plate for injection moulds. The considered flank milling parameters include the coolant employment, number of end mill flutes, cutting speed, feed per <b>tooth,</b> axial <b>depth</b> of cut, and radial depth of cut. Grey-Taguchi method is combining the orthogonal array (OA) design of experiments (DOE) with grey-relational analysis (GRA), which enables the determination of the optimal combination of flank milling parameters for multiple process responses. The basic idea of GRAis to find a grey-relational grade (GRG), which can be used for the optimization conversion from a multi-objective case to a single-objective case. GRG is also used to estimate the parameter effects on the overall performance response...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this {{long-term}} clinical {{study was to examine}} the additional efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) to scaling and root planing (SRP) in patients with chronic periodontal disease. Methods: A total of 22 patients (mean age: 59. 3 ± 11. 7 years) with chronic periodontal disease and four <b>teeth</b> with probing <b>depth</b> ≥ 5 mm were enrolled in the study. Inclusion criteria were: no systemic disease, no smoking, no pregnancy and no long-term medication. Beside the anamnesis, the following clinical parameters were assessed a...|$|R
