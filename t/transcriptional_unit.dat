25|$|The {{hedgehog}} protein {{appears to}} have evolved in two sections, the N-terminal domain (hedge) and the C-terminal domain (hog), that only later were spliced together into a single <b>transcriptional</b> <b>unit.</b> The Hog domain contains a sequence called Hint (Hedgehog INTein), which is similar in sequence and function to bacterial and fungal inteins. The Hog domain is present in many eukaryotic branches, i.e. red algae, mosses, dinoflagellates, jakobids, and other single cell eurkaryotes. Choanoflagellates contain a gene named hoglet that also encodes the hedgehog C-terminal domain Hog domain. However, Choanoflagellates and lower eukaryotes do not contain any regions similar to the hedge domain, suggesting that hog evolved first. Poriferans have both hedge-like proteins (termed hedgling) and hog-like proteins, but they exist as two completely separate transcriptional units. Cnidarians contain the hedgling and hog genes, but also have a complete hedgehog gene, indicating that hedge and hog were spliced into hedgehog after the last common ancestor of poriferans and cnidarians. Bilaterians do not contain hedgling genes, suggesting that these were lost by deletion before this branch split from the other metazoans. However, Hog domain-containing genes without a Hedge domain are present in several bilaterian branches. They are found in lophotrochozoa and nematodes. While Enoplea nematodes also have a bona-fide Hedgehog, the branch leading to C. elegans has lost hedgehog, but has dramatically expanded the Hog genes.|$|E

The sensitivity (81 %) and specificity (90 %) of our method compares favorably to other established methods.

However, because the precise number and types of errors are difficult to track, it is not obvious how to significantly improve the algorithm.

40|$|Abstract Background A key post {{genomics}} {{challenge is}} to identify how genes in an organism come together and perform physiological functions. An important first step in this direction is to identify <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units,</b> operons and regulons in a genome. Here we implement and report a strategy to computationally identify <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units</b> and operons of mycobacteria and construct a database-MycoperonDB. Description We have predicted <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units</b> and operons in mycobacteria and organized these predictions {{in the form of}} relational database called MycoperonDB. MycoperonDB database at present consists of 18053 genes organized as 8256 predicted operons and <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units</b> from five closely related species of mycobacteria. The database further provides literature links for experimentally characterized operons. All known promoters and related information is collected, analysed and stored. It provides a user friendly interface to allow a web based navigation of transcription units and operons. The web interface provides search tools to locate transcription factor binding DNA motif upstream to various genes. The reliability of operon prediction has been assessed by comparing the predicted operons with a set of known operons. Conclusion MycoperonDB is a publicly available structured relational database which has information about mycobacterial genes, <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units</b> and operons. We expect this database to assist molecular biologists/microbiologists in general, to hypothesize functional linkages between operonic genes of mycobacteria, their experimental characterization and validation. The database is freely available from our website [URL]. </p...|$|R
40|$|In iron-limited environments, the plant-growth-stimulating Pseudomonas putida WCS 358 {{produces}} a yellow-green fluorescent siderophore called pseudobactin 358. The transcriptional {{organization and the}} iron-regulated expression of a major gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis and transport of pseudobactin 358 were analyzed in detail. The cluster comprises a region with a minimum length of 33. 5 kilobases and contains at least five <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units,</b> of which some are relatively large. The directions of transcription of four <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units</b> were determined by RNA-RNA hybridization and by analysis in Escherichia coli minicells. The latter also demonstrated that large polypeptides were encoded by these <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units.</b> The results allowed us to localize several promoter regions on the DNA.

An increased propensity to separate the DNA strands (the so-called 'stress induced duplex destabilization' potential, SIDD) can serve the formation of secondary structures such as cruciforms or slippage structures, which are recognizable features {{for a number of}} enzymes (DNAses, topoisomerases, poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerases and enzymes of the histone-acetylation and DNA-methylation apparatus). S/MARs have been classified as either being constitutive (acting as permanent domain boundaries in all cell types) or facultative (cell type- and activity-related) depending on their dynamic properties.|$|E
50|$|About 1% of RP {{patients}} have mutations in cGMP alpha-subunit. Eight mutations have been identified- four are nonsense mutations, {{one is a}} deletion that includes most of the <b>transcriptional</b> <b>unit.</b> The other three are missense mutations and frameshift mutations, which lead to a shortening of amino acid sequence in the C terminus. It is still not known why the absence of cGMP-gated cation channels causes photoreceptor degradation. Mutations causing RP have also {{been found in the}} rhodopsin gene and in the alpha- and beta-subunits of rod phosphodiesterase, which encode rod phototransduction cascades. The mutation of these subunits indirectly impairs rod cGMP-gated channel function, which implies that there is a common mechanism of photoreceptor degradation.|$|E
5000|$|OspE and OspF were {{initially}} identified in B. burgdorferi strain N40. [...] The ospE and ospF genes are structurally arranged in tandem as one <b>transcriptional</b> <b>unit</b> {{under the control}} of a common promoter. [...] Individual strains of B. burgdorferi carry multiple related copies of the ospEF locus, which are now collectively referred to as Erp (Osp'E'/F-like 'r'elated 'p'rotein) genes. In B. burgdoreri strains B31 and 297, most of the Erp loci occupy the same position on the multiple copies of the cp32 plasmid present in these strains. [...] Each locus consists of one or two Erp genes. When two genes are present, they are transcribed as one operon, although in some cases, an internal promoter in the first gene may also transcribe the second gene. [...] The presence of multiple Erp proteins was proposed to be important in allowing B. burgdorferi to evade killing by the alternative complement pathway of a broad range of potential animal hosts, as individual Erp proteins exhibited different binding patterns to the complement regulator factor H from different animals. [...] However, the presence of factor H was recently demonstrated to not be necessary to enable B. burgdorferi to infect mice, suggesting the Erp proteins have an additional function.|$|E

Since marker exchange mutant strains with insertions in one 3. 7 -kbp portion of pig could not be obtained, mutations in this region may be lethal to the bacterium. Complementation analyses with different insertion mutations further defined and confirmed the seven <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units.</b> Insertional inactivation {{of one of the}} <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units,</b> pigB, resulted in greatly reduced levels of both xanthomonadins and extracellular polysaccharide slime, and a pigB-encoding plasmid restored both traits to these strains. pigB mutant strains could also be restored extracellularly by growth adjacent to strains with insertion mutations in any of the other six xanthomonadin <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units,</b> the parent strain (B- 24), or strains of five different species of Xanthomonas. Strain B- 24 produced a nontransforming diffusible factor (DF), which could be restored to pigB mutants by the pigB-encoding plasmid.

40|$|Motivation: A {{major issue}} in {{computational}} biology is the reconstruction of functional relationships among genes, for example the definition of regulatory or biochemical pathways. One step towards this aim is the elucidation of <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units,</b> which are characterized by co-responding changes in mRNA expression levels. These units of genes will allow the generation of hypotheses about respective functional interrelationships. Thus, the focus of analysis currently moves from well-established functional assignment through comparison of protein and DNA sequences towards analysis of transcriptional co-response. Tools that allow deducing common control of gene expression {{have the potential to}} complement and extend routine BLAST comparisons, because gene function may be inferred from common transcriptional control. Results: We present a co-clustering strategy of genome sequence information and gene expression data, which was applied to identify <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units</b> within diverse compendia of expression profiles. The phenomenon of prokaryotic operons was selected as an ideal test case to generate wellfounded hypotheses about <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units.</b> The existence of overlapping and ambiguous operon definitions allowed the investigation of constitutive and conditional expression of <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units</b> in independent gene expression experiments of Escherichia coli. Our approach allowed identification of operons with high accuracy. Furthermore, both constitutive mRNA co-response as well as conditional differences became apparent. Thus, we were able to generate insight into the possible biological relevance of gene co-response. We conclude that the suggested strategy will be amenable in general to the identification of <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units</b> beyond the chosen example of E. coli operons.

40|$|Background: RNA-seq and its variant {{differential}} RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) {{are today}} routine methods for transcriptome analysis in bacteria. While expression profiling and transcriptional start site prediction are standard tasks today, {{the problem of}} identifying <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units</b> in a genome-wide fashion is still not solved for prokaryotic systems. Results: We present RNASEG, an algorithm for the prediction of <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units</b> based on dRNA-seq data. A key feature of the algorithm is that, based on the data, it distinguishes between transcribed and un-transcribed genomic segments. Furthermore, the program provides many different predictions in a single run, {{which can be used}} to infer the significance of <b>transcriptional</b> <b>units</b> in a consensus procedure. We show the performance of our method based on a well-studied dRNA-seq data set for Helicobacter pylori. Conclusions: With our algorithm it is possible to identify operons and 5 '- and 3 '-UTRs in an automated fashion.

40|$|Antibiotic {{biosynthesis}} {{is regulated}} by glucose in Pseudomonas fluorescens HV 37 a. Fusions between antibiotic biosynthetic operons (afu operons) and the Escherichia coli lac operon were isolated {{to evaluate the}} genetic determinants for the regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis. Four afu transcriptional units were defined, afuE, afuR, afuAB, and afuP. The afuE and afuR transcripts were promoted divergently at one locus and were catabolite induced, by 250 -fold and 5 -fold, respectively; the afuAB and afuP transcriptional units were not linked to the others and were not catabolite induced. Thus, regulation of afuE and afuR operon transcription is apparently the mechanism whereby glucose regulates antibiotic biosynthesis. Catabolite induction of the afuE and afuR <b>transcriptional</b> <b>unit</b> was dependent on {{the products of the}} afuA, afuB, and afuP genes.
