25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the <b>spring</b> <b>retainer</b> (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the <b>spring</b> <b>retainer</b> which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the <b>retainer,</b> <b>spring</b> and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the <b>retainer</b> allowing the <b>springs</b> to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the <b>spring</b> <b>retainer</b> rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|R
50|$|Poppet valves {{typically}} require small coil springs, appropriately named valve springs, to {{keep them}} closed when not actuated by the camshaft. They {{are attached to the}} valve stem ends, seating within <b>spring</b> <b>retainers.</b> Other mechanisms can be used in place of valve springs to keep the valves closed: Formula 1 engines employ pneumatic valve springs in which pneumatic pressure closes the valves, while motorcycle manufacturer Ducati uses desmodromic valve drive which mechanically close the valves.|$|R
40|$|A wedge {{and spring}} {{assembly}} {{for use in}} electromagnets or dynamoelectric machines having a housing with an axis therethrough and a plurality of coils supported on salient poles that extend radially inward from the housing toward the housing axis to define a plurality of interpole spaces, respectively between the housing and adjacent coils, the interpole spaces each extending in a direction generally parallel to the housing axis. The wedge and spring assembly includes a nonmagnetic <b>retainer</b> <b>spring</b> and a nonmagnetic wedge. The <b>retainer</b> <b>spring</b> is formed to fit {{into one of the}} interpole spaces, and has juxtaposed ends defining between them a slit extending in a direction generally parallel to the housing axis. The wedge for insertion into the slit provides an outwardly directed force on respective portions of the juxtaposed ends defining the slit to expand the slit so that respective portions of the <b>retainer</b> <b>spring</b> engage areas of the coils adjacent thereto, thereby resiliently holding the coils against their respective salient poles. Preferably, the <b>spring</b> <b>retainer</b> and wedge are self-locking wherein wedge is fabricated from a material softer than a material the <b>retainer</b> <b>spring</b> is fabricated from, so that the wedge is securely retained in the slit. The <b>retainer</b> <b>spring</b> is generally triangular shaped to fit within the interpole space and fabricated from berryllium-copper alloy, and the wedge is generally T-shaped and fabricated from aluminum. Alternatively, a wedge and spring assembly includes a wedge having divergent sloped surfaces in which each surface and the respective juxtaposed ends of the <b>retainer</b> <b>spring</b> are angled relative to one another so that the wedge is securely retained in the slit by friction existing between its sloped surfaces and the juxtaposed ends of the retaining spring...|$|R

The system is simplified as a three-mass system based on a transfer matrix calculation. Governing equations for both models with and without <b>retainer</b> <b>spring</b> are derived. A fast integration method is used to obtain vibration responses. Both concentric and eccentric responses at the damper are examined. Different imbalances and different supply pressures are supplied to see their influence on the vibration of the system.

40|$|A twin {{caliper brake}} system is {{investigated}} using {{the whole body}} visual technique of holographic interferometry. It is shown that the disc mode of vibration has a preferred position where a disc antinode is situated under one caliper and a disc node under the second caliper. The maximum angular space occupied by the pad antinode is, as predicted by the theoretical study of the disc/pad interface geometry, the angle subtended by the pad length. For a four- piston opposed caliper the minimum distance is slightly larger than the piston centers. There {{is evidence that the}} disc mode position, in relation to the two calipers, may be antinode/node, node/node or antinode/antinode. With these arrangements an accompanying revised theoretical study of the disc/pad interface geometry predicts two stable conditions are possible - if the calipers are positioned either at an angle between 125 to 130 or 165 to 175. The smaller angle was not tested but the brake became quiet at angles greater than 166.

40|$|The {{delineation}} {{of groundwater}} protection zones around springs requires {{the assessment of}} the spring vulnerability, aquifer properties, and preferential infiltration zones in the recharge area.

5000|$|The {{desmodromic}} system avoids this problem, {{because it}} does not have to overcome the static energy of the spring. It must work against the momentum of the valve opening and closing, and that force still depends on the effective mass of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the valve spring mass and all of the valve <b>spring</b> <b>retainer</b> mass. However, a desmodromic system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker arms per valve, so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the cams and rocker arms. It is relatively easy to use roller tappets in conventional valvetrains, although it does add considerable moving mass. In a desmodromic system the roller would be needed {{at one end of the}} rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its [...] "effective mass" [...] advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the cam and rocker arm and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another possible disadvantage is that it would be very difficult to incorporate hydraulic valve lash adjusters in a desmodromic system, so the valves must be periodically adjusted, but this is true of typical performance oriented motorcycles as valve lash is typically set using a shim under a cam follower.|$|R
