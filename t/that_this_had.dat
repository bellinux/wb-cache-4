5|$|Following {{the example}} of Mozambique, the Zambian and Botswana governments {{permitted}} guerrillas to establish bases from which they could threaten and infiltrate Rhodesia. Van der Byl told a newspaper reporter <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> to be expected.

5|$|His {{political}} {{projects were}} put on hold, and Caragiale instead concentrated his energy on obtaining the French Légion d'honneur order, eventually becoming one of its Chevaliers in December 1929.

5|$|It {{became clear}} that Auschwitz was not a normal {{internment}} camp with above-average SS rations, but that it served an additional function. Gröning was informed that money taken from interned Jews was not actually returned to them. When he inquired further, his colleagues confirmed that the Jews were being systematically exterminated and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> included the transport of prisoners who had arrived the previous night.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{sometimes}} made sudden, {{drastic changes}} to the group. On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> been merely a test. Lalich sees this as {{a way that they}} increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{conflicting}} {{conclusions of the}} first two, a third post-mortem was conducted on 22 April by Kenneth Shorrock {{on behalf of the}} Metropolitan police, and Ben Swift on behalf of Simon Harwood. Shorrock and Swift agreed with the results of the second autopsy. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, told the pathologists before the final post-mortem that Tomlinson had fallen to {{the ground in front of}} a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> happened. The IPCC ruled in May 2011 that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead.|$|E

5|$|Between 1885 and 1908 it was {{believed}} that the signal had been sent using the 1799 code book, as in 1885 it was pointed out <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> not been replaced until 1808. In 1908 it was discovered, the Admiralty had, in fact, changed the signal code in November 1803, after the 1799 version had been captured by the French, and new code books had been issued to Nelson's fleet at Cadiz in September 1805. As a result, books published between these two dates show the signal using the wrong flags.|$|E
5|$|Claiming {{the right}} to name his discovery, Le Verrier quickly {{proposed}} the name Neptune for this new planet, though falsely stating <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes. In October, he sought to name the planet Le Verrier, after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, François Arago. This suggestion met with stiff resistance outside France. French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name Herschel for Uranus, after that planet's discoverer Sir William Herschel, and Leverrier for the new planet.|$|E
5|$|During the {{discussion}} about deregulation, Braathens SAFE considered several possibilities to strengthen itself. In particular, it had discussions with the large European airlines Lufthansa, British Airways and KLM about an alliance, but these were rejected by Braathens SAFE, stating that the agreements were all about getting traffic to the partner's hub. Minister of Transport, Kjell Opseth and director of SAS in Norway, Jan Reinås, both proposed a merger between Braathens SAFE and SAS, {{to ensure that the}} company had a 100% market share on the primary routes before the merger. This would, according to them, secure that no foreign company could compete with the merged company. The proposal was rejected by Braathens SAFE's management. Still, negotiations started between the companies in 1992, although they were quickly abandoned. The press reported the price of Braathens SAFE to be NOK1.2 billion, but <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> been rejected as too expensive by SAS.|$|E

5|$|Franklin's mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt, was adamantly {{against the}} idea of divorce, however, as it would {{mark the end of}} Franklin's {{political}} career; she stated that she would cut him off from the family fortune if he chose to do so. Historians have also debated whether, as a Roman Catholic, Mercer would have been willing to marry a divorced man. Eleanor Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook expressed skepticism <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> been a serious obstacle, noting the depth of Mercer's feelings. Persico also doubts that this was a factor, observing that Mercer's mother Minnie had divorced and remarried, and that the family had come to Roman Catholicism only recently.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 a major DNA {{study of}} golden jackals {{concluded}} that the six C.aureus subspecies found in Africa should be reclassified under the new species C.anthus (African golden wolf), {{reducing the number of}} golden jackal subspecies to seven. The phylogenetic tree generated from this study shows the golden jackal diverging from the wolf/coyote lineage 1.9million years ago and the African golden wolf diverging 1.3million years ago. The study found that the golden jackal and the African golden wolf shared a very similar skull and body morphology and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> confused taxonomists into regarding these as one species. The study proposes that the very similar skull and body morphology is due to both species having originated from a larger common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, Phillies scouts {{evaluated}} pitcher Pedro Martínez in two simulated {{games against}} the Phillies DSL team, leading to a one-year, $1-million contract.

5|$|In September York {{arrived from}} Ireland, {{and at the}} {{parliament}} of October that year, the duke {{walked up to the}} throne and put his hand on it. The act, signifying usurpation, left the assembly in shock. It is unclear whether Warwick had prior knowledge of York's plans, though it is assumed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> been agreed upon between the two in Ireland the previous March. It soon became clear, however, that this regime change was unacceptable to the lords in parliament, and a compromise was agreed. The Act of Accord of 31October 1460 stated that while Henry VI was allowed to stay on the throne for the remainder of his life, his son Edward, Prince of Wales, was to be disinherited. Instead, York would succeed the king, and act as protector.|$|E
5|$|In late 2003, it was {{discovered}} that Texan businessman Allen Stanford had given both Joseph and fellow minister Gaston Browne cheques worth 100,000 East Caribbean dollars. While Browne denied suggestions <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> constituted bribery, claiming that the money had gone towards community projects, Leader of the Opposition Baldwin Spencer demanded that both ministers resign. Both ministers were part of a team negotiating with Stanford over a land exchange in St. John's, and the news led to protesters picketing their offices. Prime Minister Lester Bird affirmed his support in both ministers, and despite a motion of censure brought by the opposition and more protests, Stanford publicly made a second set of donations to Joseph and Browne.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1999, Color Air {{terminated}} all {{flights and}} ceased operations. On {{the day of}} the termination, the stock price of Braathens increased by 16%. Immediately following the bankruptcy, the two airlines increased their prices. Subsequently, Braathens increased their ticket price by 15%, but stated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> {{nothing to do with the}} elimination of competition, since the price increase was not on any Oslo routes. In November, Braathens started to remove routes, and announced they would increase prices by 20%. They also reintroduced the Flag of Norway on the tail, which since the rebranding had been replaced by a silver, abstract wing. Both Braathens and SAS lost more than NOK1 billion in 1999, totaling the cost of the price war between the three airlines to exceed NOK 3 billion.|$|E
