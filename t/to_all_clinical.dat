The results presented in this work are accurately reproduced with Gaussian kernel-based calculations, over two orders of magnitude change in insert volume. These results highlight the potential for individualised whole organ activity quantification, corresponding to patient organ VOIs, to improve accuracy in whole organ dosimetry. The ability to produce MRT phantom inserts, with a reduced boundary effect between regions of activity in the phantom, using commonly available ABS printers allows complex phantom inserts to be made available <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>clinical</b> centres. The ability for clinical centres to test SPECT systems with activity distributions which represent the mathematical models underlying MIRD schema dose calculations is a crucial step in establishing validated MRT dosimetry.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Since {{the advent}} of the new {{proteomics}} era more than a decade ago, large-scale studies of protein profiling have been used to identify distinctive molecular signatures in a wide array of biological systems, spanning areas of basic biological research, clinical diagnostics, and biomarker discovery directed toward therapeutic applications. Recent advances in protein separation and identification techniques have significantly improved proteomic approaches, leading to enhancement of the depth and breadth of proteome coverage. Proteomic signatures, specific for multiple diseases, including cancer and pre-invasive lesions, are emerging. This article combines, in a simple manner, relevant proteomic and OMICS clues used in the discovery and development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers that are applicable <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>clinical</b> fields, thus helping to improve applications of clinical proteomic strategies for translational medicine research. </p...|$|E
