When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Lennon was unavailable, because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment with Pang; he was stupefied and confused {{to such an extent that}} Pang believed he had been brainwashed.

5|$|Franklin died on April 12, 1945 after {{suffering}} a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia. Eleanor later learned that FDR's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd had been {{with him when he}} died, a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd. It was Anna who <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Franklin had been with Lucy when he died; in addition, she <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden the information from Eleanor. After the funeral, Eleanor temporarily returned to Val-Kill. Franklin left instructions for Eleanor in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer. After FDR's death, Eleanor moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village. In 1950, she rented suites at The Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street). She lived here until 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd Street. When that lease expired in 1958, she returned to The Park Sheraton as she waited for the house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future presidential libraries.|$|E

5|$|Scully {{introduces}} Mulder to Kritschgau, {{who claims}} that everything Mulder {{thinks he knows}} about aliens is a lie. He tells him that his sister's abduction was fabricated, that all evidence of alien biology are merely scientific anomalies, and that the alien body he has just examined was fake.

5|$|After {{completing}} the first 15 {{years of the}} sentence, Lebrón's social worker <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she could ask for parole, {{but she did not}} display interest in the proposal, never signing the required documentation. Due to this lack of interest, she was mandated to attend a meeting before a penitentiary committee, where she presented a written deposition expressing her position about the parole proposal as well as other subjects including terrorism, politics and the United States' use of the atomic bomb. Following this the other inmates reacted with skepticism over her intentions to refuse the offer, which made her distance herself from them and focus her attention in studying as well as writing poetry. During this timeframe, Lebrón's interest in religion grew. Lebrón's daughter Gladys died in 1977, while her mother was in prison.|$|E

They even brought in her husband to let him see her being tortured. After nine months in captivity, Elizabeth had lost half her body weight.|$|E

It was submitted to and turned down {{by a series of}} publishers, one of whom <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> it needed something more than just the bare recipes. David took note, and wrote some linking text, interspersing her own brief prose with relevant excerpts {{from a wide range of}} authors known for their writings about the Mediterranean. They included Norman Douglas, Lawrence Durrell, Gertrude Stein, D. H. Lawrence, Osbert Sitwell, Compton Mackenzie, Arnold Bennett, Henry James and Théophile Gautier.|$|E

5|$|Hours earlier, Lucan had again {{called his}} mother, at about 12:30am. He <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{he would be}} in touch later that day, but {{declined}} to speak with the police constable who had accompanied her to her flat; instead, he said he would call the police later that morning. Ranson discovered that Lucan had travelled to Uckfield when he was called by Ian Maxwell-Scott, who told him that Lucan had arrived at his home a few hours after the murder, and spoken with his wife, Susan. While there, the earl had written two letters to his brother-in-law, Bill Shand-Kydd, and posted them to his London address. Maxwell-Scott also called Shand-Kydd at his country house near Leighton Buzzard and told him about the letters, prompting the latter to immediately drive to London to collect them.

5|$|In 1954, at {{a psychic}} event in California, Ruth was {{introduced}} to Ernest Norman, who <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> in a past life {{she had been the}} daughter of an Egyptian Pharaoh and had protected Moses. Members of the organization they later established, the Unarius Academy of Science, affirm that Ernest and Ruth married on the day they met, and the group celebrates their anniversary as February14, 1954. However, Diana Tumminia of California State University, Sacramento, notes in her 2005 study of the group that Ruth was probably still married to George Marian in early 1954 and speculates that their divorce was a lengthy process; Tumminia posits that Ernest and Ruth married in 1956.|$|E
