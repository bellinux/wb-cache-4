5|$|The {{magneto-optical}} drive manufactured by Canon Inc. {{was used as}} the primary mass storage device. These drives were relatively new to the market, and the NeXT was the first computer to use them. They were cheaper than hard drives (blank media especially so: though each had a cost of $150 to Canon, Jobs's typically forthright negotiations saw Canon agree to a retail of only $50 apiece) but slower (with an average seek time of 96 ms). The design made it impossible to move files between computers without a network, since each NeXT Computer had only one MO drive and the disk could not be removed without shutting down the system. Storage options proved challenging for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>NeXT</b> Computers. The magneto-optical media was relatively expensive and had performance and reliability problems despite being faster than a floppy drive. The drive was not sufficient to run as the primary medium running the NeXTSTEP operating system both in terms of speed and capacity.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{previous}} bike-sharing systems, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>next</b> generation bike-sharing system, {{was introduced in}} 1991 in Farsø. Even {{though it was a}} small-scale scheme, it {{paved the way for the}} Copenhagen's ByCyklen programme, which was introduced in 1995 and was the first large-scale urban bike-sharing programme to feature specially designed bicycles with parts which could not be used on other bikes. To obtain a bicycle, riders paid a refundable deposit at one of 110 special locking bike stands, and the riders then had unlimited use of the bike within a specified 'city bike zone'. The fine for not returning a bicycle or leaving the bike-sharing zone exceeded US$150, and was strictly enforced by the police. Originally, the programme's founders hoped to completely finance the programme by selling advertising space on the bicycles, which was placed on the bike's frame and its solid disc-type wheels. This funding source quickly proved to be insufficient, and the city of Copenhagen took over the administration of the programme, funding most of the programme costs through appropriations from city revenues along with contributions from corporate donors. Since the City Bikes programme was free to the user, there is no return on the capital invested by the municipality, and a considerable amount of public funds was constantly used to keep the system in service, to enforce regulations, and to replace missing bikes. In 2013 a new version was expected to be introduced but the municipality of Copenhagen temporarily withdrew its support and there were no free bicycles for most of 2013. Copenhagen municipality changed its mind and a new version was introduced in late 2013.|$|E
500|$|NeXT (later NeXT Computer and NeXT Software) was an American {{computer}} and software company founded in 1985 by Apple Computer co-founder Steve Jobs, based in Redwood City, California, that developed and manufactured {{a series of}} computer workstations intended for the higher education and business markets. [...] NeXT was founded by Jobs after he left Apple, along with several co-workers. [...] NeXT introduced <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>NeXT</b> Computer in 1988, and the smaller NeXTstation in 1990. [...] The NeXT computers experienced relatively limited sales, with estimates of about 50,000 units shipped in total. Nevertheless, their innovative object-oriented NeXTSTEP operating system and development environment were highly influential.|$|E

Michael Piller said that he felt {{that in order to}} be a hero, Picard [...] "should be acting out of a moral and ethical mindset, and stand for principles that are important to mankind". Stewart was later pleased with the film's romantic sub-plot, calling it [...] "charming" [...] and saying that he was [...] "feeling very good about it." [...] He thought that the film had a lighter tone than previous films, saying, [...] "It shows our crew having a little more fun than we normally see them doing". Stewart was disappointed that a scene in which Picard and Anij kiss was cut from {{the final version of the}} film, saying that [...] "It was a studio decision, but still somewhat inexplicable to me as I feel the audience were waiting for some kind of romantic culmination to the relationship, which did happen and was extremely pleasant." [...] Stewart received a producer's credit on the film.|$|E

60|$|Soon {{after this}} notable production, {{which was written}} with the ripe folly of forty-seven, Young took orders, and was {{presently}} appointed chaplain to the King. “The Brothers,” his third and last tragedy, which was already in rehearsal, he now withdrew from the stage, and sought reputation in a way more accordant with the decorum of his new profession, by turning prose writer. But after publishing “A True Estimate of Human Life,” with a dedication to the Queen, {{as one of the}} “most shining representatives” of God on earth, and a sermon, entitled “An Apology for Princes; or, the Reverence due to Government,” preached before the House of Commons, his Pindaric ambition again seized him, and he matched his former ode by another, called “Imperium Pelagi, a Naval Lyric; written in imitation of Pindar’s spirit, occasioned by his Majesty’s return from Hanover, 1729, and the succeeding Peace.” Since he afterward suppressed this second ode, we must suppose that it was rather worse than <b>the</b> <b>first.</b> <b>Next</b> came his two “Epistles to Pope, concerning the Authors of the Age,” remarkable for nothing but the audacity of affectation with which the most servile of poets professes to despise servility.|$|E
