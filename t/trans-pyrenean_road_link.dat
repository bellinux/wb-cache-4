5000|$|A Roman castrum {{dating to}} the end of the 4th century has been proven as a {{fortified}} place of Novempopulania. Named Lapurdum, the name became the name of the province of Labourd. According to Eugene Goyheneche the name Baiona designated the city, the port, and the cathedral while that of Lapurdum was only a territorial designation. This Roman settlement was strategic as it allowed the monitoring of the <b>trans-Pyrenean</b> <b>roads</b> and of local people rebellious to the Roman power. The construction covered 6 to 10 hectares according to several authors.|$|R

30|$|Time is {{expressed}} {{in the form of}} 96 intervals of 15 minutes covering the 24 hours of a day. Speed measurements pertaining to a given <b>road</b> <b>link,</b> day, and time interval are averaged (using harmonic averages) to form a single observation. This leads to roughly 2.5 million (M) observations for Viennese <b>road</b> <b>links,</b> roughly 1.1 M. observations for <b>road</b> <b>links</b> in Linz, and roughly 1.25 M. observations for <b>road</b> <b>links</b> in Lyon. The associated speed limits and road classification information are taken from OpenStreetMap. Finally, every <b>road</b> <b>link</b> is assigned a functional road classification (frc) number {{on the basis of its}} OpenStreetMap highway tag. These numbers indicate the road type and range from one (motorways) to eight (living streets). As a rough guide, the importance of <b>road</b> <b>links</b> decreases as the frc number increases.|$|R
