50|$|Guests board <b>the</b> <b>train</b> at <b>the</b> <b>train</b> station {{located on}} the South Midway of the Lagoon Amusement Park. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> travels {{clockwise}} around a lagoon, through a tunnel, past the various exhibits, and ends back at <b>the</b> <b>train</b> station.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the ride, the linear induction motors propel <b>the</b> <b>train</b> forward out of the station during its first launch at 50 mi/h km/h, which carries <b>the</b> <b>train</b> approximately halfway up the front tower. After coming to a stop, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> falls and enters the LIM section again, where <b>the</b> <b>train</b> is accelerated during its second launch to 63 mi/h km/h in the backward direction so that <b>the</b> <b>train</b> climbs halfway up the rear tower. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> then stops and drops forward before re-entering the LIM section where additional thrust is added as <b>the</b> <b>train</b> gains to 69 mi/h km/h during its third launch, causing <b>the</b> <b>train</b> to reach its highest point on the front tower. Stopping and reversing, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> drops and re-enters the LIM section where the LIM launches <b>the</b> <b>train</b> for <b>the</b> fourth time, making <b>the</b> <b>train</b> reach a maximum speed of 72 mi/h km/h to travel a maximum of 206 ft up the rear tower. With the one more final pass forward through the LIM section, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> goes up <b>the</b> front spike once more before <b>the</b> <b>train</b> reverses. As it travels back toward the station, the brakes are applied and it stops within the station platform. Unlike other Inverted roller coasters, there is no floor in the loading station that drops out underneath <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> Riders must climb into their seats when loading.|$|R

5|$|Initially, <b>the</b> <b>training</b> {{period was}} for six weeks; {{later it was}} changed to eight weeks. General in scope, the program was {{designed}} to give cadets an overall view of the USCG. Academic study included: administration, correspondence, communications, history, organization, personnel, public speaking, ships, and special lectures and visual aids. The regimental part of <b>the</b> <b>training</b> was designed to help cadets adjust to military life, and to acquaint them with their responsibilities as officers. The cadets {{ranged in age from}} 20 to 40, with diverse civilian backgrounds from teachers and journalists to lawyers and technicians.|$|E
40|$|Maglev {{trains are}} {{wonderful}} inventions that fly on air. They use magnets to levitate and propel <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> forward. There is no friction between <b>the</b> <b>train</b> and <b>the</b> track! The batteries can levitate <b>the</b> <b>train</b> for 30 minutes without any additional energy. Linear generators in the magnets on board <b>the</b> <b>train</b> use <b>the</b> motion of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> to recharge <b>the</b> batteries...|$|R
30|$|In summary, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> {{speed is}} one of the {{critical}} parameters that governs the comfort and safety of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> running on <b>the</b> cantilever deck. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> speed should be less than the speed 245  km/h to guarantee the safety of <b>the</b> <b>train.</b>|$|R
500|$|After <b>the</b> <b>train</b> {{has been}} moved into the {{horizontal}} position and is dispatched from the station, depending on which station <b>the</b> <b>train</b> is in (Tatsu has two stations), <b>the</b> <b>train</b> will either make a left or right s-bend towards the [...] lift hill.

5|$|Of the graduating {{classes at}} Hunter, 83% {{went on to}} {{specialized}} schools to train as yeomen; radiomen; storekeepers, and cooks and bakers. In addition to the college campuses, enlisted WAVES also trained at Georgia State College for Women in Milledgeville; Burdett College in Boston, and Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. The Bureaus of Aeronautics and Medicine opened their doors to enlisted WAVES. <b>The</b> <b>training</b> in aeronautics took place at naval air stations and training centers; <b>the</b> <b>training</b> for medical technicians {{was held at the}} National Medical and Great Lakes Training Centers.

5|$|Participants in est {{are told}} that they cannot take notes during the course, {{and at the end}} of the seminar the {{instructor}} declines to go over a review of <b>the</b> <b>training.</b> In order to participate in the course, trainees must adhere to agreements which include: they may not exit the course facility except during specified break time, they cannot sit next to someone they knew before coming to the course, and they cannot take unprescribed medications or alcohol for the week prior to <b>the</b> <b>training.</b>|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>train</b> {{has been}} moved into the {{horizontal}} position and is dispatched from the station, depending on which station <b>the</b> <b>train</b> is in (Tatsu has two stations), <b>the</b> <b>train</b> will either make a left or right s-bend towards the 170 ft lift hill.

50|$|Alternatively, {{propulsion}} coils on the guideway {{are used}} to exert a force on the magnets in <b>the</b> <b>train</b> and make <b>the</b> <b>train</b> move forward. <b>The</b> propulsion coils that exert a force on <b>the</b> <b>train</b> are effectively a linear motor: an alternating current flowing through the coils generates a continuously varying magnetic field that moves forward along the track. The frequency of the alternating current is synchronized to match the speed of <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> <b>The</b> offset between the field exerted by magnets on <b>the</b> <b>train</b> and <b>the</b> applied field creates a force moving <b>the</b> <b>train</b> forward.|$|R
50|$|Station timing, {{a method}} of evening out trains, has been imposed on certain {{stations}} with interlocking (or home) signals. These signals turn to a red aspect as a train passes it, and is forced red for a variable amount of time. This time depends on the distance between <b>the</b> last <b>train</b> that passed <b>the</b> signal, and <b>the</b> <b>train</b> that comes after <b>the</b> next <b>train.</b> This system is computerized, and can accurately calculate the relative distances. If <b>the</b> next <b>train</b> is closer to <b>the</b> <b>train</b> before than <b>the</b> <b>train</b> after, then <b>the</b> signal will hold <b>the</b> <b>train</b> at <b>the</b> station. If <b>the</b> next <b>train</b> is closer to <b>the</b> <b>train</b> after it than <b>the</b> <b>train</b> before it, then the signal will clear.|$|R

500|$|The {{roller coaster}} begins {{the same way}} that the XT 150 model does.
