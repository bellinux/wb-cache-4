40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{research}} self-similar α-stable symmetric processes. These processes accure in finance market, nature, various physic systems. Processes were modeled by generating data with different stability parameter α, which was changed from 1, 1 to 2. Modeled processes were researched with four different methods: R/S statistic, absoliute moment, aggregated variance and variance of residuals method. Hurst index and its standart deviation were estimated for that purpose. Data of different lengths (2000, 5000, 10000) were researched. This research was made repeatedly with data samples of 100 and 1000. To make this research program was written with C++ programming language. Results of Hurst index values were compared with <b>theorical</b> <b>values</b> also mean absolute pecentage error was calculated for each method. Results of this research showed, that results calculated with variance of residuals method and absolute moments method were much closer to <b>theorical</b> <b>values</b> than results with other two methods...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{underlying the}} vacuolar retention or release of 1 -(malonylamino) cyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (MACC), the conjugated {{form of the}} ethylene precursor, has been studied in grape (Vitis vinifera) cells grown in vitro using the technique of compartmental analysis of radioisotope elution. Following its accumulation in the vacuole, M[2, 3 - 14 C]ACC could be released from cells when the vacuolar pH was artificially lowered by external buffers from its initial value of 6. 2 to below the critical pH of 5. 5. Successive release and retention of vacuolar MACC could be achieved by switching the vacuolar pH from values lower and higher than 5. 5. The rate constant of efflux was highly correlated with the vacuolar pH. In plant tissues having low vacuolar pH under natural conditions, e. g. apple fruits (pH 4. 2) and mung bean hypocotyls (pH 5. 3), an efflux of M[2, 3 - 14 C]ACC also occurred. Its rate constant closely corresponded to the <b>theorical</b> <b>values</b> derived from the correlation established for grape cells. Evidence is presented that the efflux proceeded by passive lipophilic membrane diffusion only when MACC was in the protonated form. In contrast to other organic anions like malic acid, the mono and diionic species could not permeate the tonoplast, thus indicating the strict dependence of MACC retention upon the ionic status of the molecule {{and the absence of}} carrier-mediated efflux...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{works have}} shown it is {{possible}} to realize photo-written cavity lasers with rare earth doped silicate fibres. Most of these new laser sources can be pumped by market laser diodes, what makes them valuables for their integretion in system. Furthermore, their laser effect threshold (1 - 2 mW), their spectral width (a few Ghz), their conversion rate, close to the theorical value and their wavelength tunablelity allow their use {{in a wide range of}} applications such as telecommunications, sensors, etc [...] . We present here experimental results on a particular application of this kind of lasers in the field of detection of a gas by identification of one of its absorption lines by use of classical linear spectroscopic methods. We have carried out our experiments on an absorption line of water. We present first the making process of the fibre lasers and the method used to insure their tunablelity around the selected absorption line of water. Two lasers have been designed for this work. We give their respective characteristics, i. e. their spectral width, slope, polarisation state and we compare them with the <b>theorical</b> <b>values.</b> Secondly, we give the absorption spectra obtained with both these lasers scanning their wavelength. These spectra consist on the detected light intensity versus the laser wavelength with the laser beam freely propagating through a few meters of absorbing medium. At least, we present the preliminary experimental results on the optoacoustics detection of an absorption line of water obtained using the fibre laser having the best characteristics. The obtained curve gives the detected acoustic power versus scanned wavelength range using a non optimized acoustic cell of a few cm long containing air at room pressure and temperature...|$|E
40|$|Urea, {{creatinine}} (24 cases) and albumin (22 cases) {{were determined}} in nasal secretum and in serum in 50 subjects. The {{correlation between the}} values in the secretum and in the serum significative only for urea and creatinine. The regression coefficient of urea was particularly high and we suggest that the values of urea in nasal secretum may be calculated as 1, 3 times its serum levels. This relationship {{may be useful to}} calculate the dilution of the samples of respiratory secretum collected by lavage, utilizing the ratio between the actual urea in the sample and its <b>theorical</b> <b>value...</b>|$|R
40|$|Collaborative {{research}} in the Macrofauna project has enabled development of some techniques that presently are {{at different stages of}} advancement, from promising pilot experiments (tomato production and inoculation in plant nursery bags at Yurimaguas and in India) to the fully developed technique of massive worm production and biofertilization of tea gardens in Tamil Nadu (India) (patent deposited). Failures have also helped to gain better insight into the potential feasibility of techniques that had been considered in the objectives of this project. Endogeic earthworms (#Pontoscolex corethrurus$) may be produced in large quantities, i. e. about 12000 worms (1. 6 - 2. 8 kg live wt) /m 2 /year in specific culture beds using either sawdust (Yurimaguas, Peru) or a mixture of high and low quality materials (Tamil Nadu, India) mixed into soil as substrates. Cost of production of 1 kg of earthworm biomass through bed culture is about 3. 6 Euro, much lower than the cost of hand collection of worms from pastures/grasslands where these species are abundant (6 - 125 Euro depending on the cost of labour and earthworm density). The <b>theorical</b> <b>value</b> of an active earthworm community with an average biomass of 400 kg live wt has been estimated at 1400 Euro, the price that it would cost to reintroduce an equivalent biomass produced in our culture units, indicating the cost of land restoration. Direct inoculation of earthworms in the field to improve production may only affect plant growth positively if a large biomass (greater than 30 g live wt/m 2) is inoculated from the beginning. An alternative may be to concentrate the inoculum in small areas regularly distributed across the field [...] . (D'après résumé d'auteur...|$|R
