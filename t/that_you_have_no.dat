500|$|Original pre-release {{advertising}} {{included a}} regional [...] "mail drop" [...] of circulars presenting screenshots of a screaming Geeson and the tagline [...] "Warning! An Horrific Alien Birth! A Violent Nightmare in Blood! Inseminoid at a Cinema Near You Soon!" [...] Warren, who regrets {{the decision to}} publicise the film in such a graphic manner, comments, [...] "The problem with mail-drops is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> way of knowing {{who lives in the}} house, or who will see it first. It could be a pregnant woman, and old lady, or even worse, a young child. So it was not such a good idea." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Afraid?" [...] {{repeated}} Sir Patrick. [...] "I understood <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> serious {{intention of}} disputing the scoundrel with Mrs. Glenarm. What motive could possibly <b>have</b> taken <b>you</b> his way?" ...|$|R
500|$|In Revenge of the Sith, McDiarmid {{played a}} darker {{interpretation}} of the character. He explained that [...] "when you're playing a character of solid blackness, {{that in itself is}} very interesting, in the sense <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> other motivation other than the accumulation of power. It's not so much about not having a moral center, it's just that the only thing that mattered is increasing power." [...] He admitted, [...] "I've been trying to find a redeeming feature to Palpatine, and the only one I've got so far is that he's clearly a patron of the arts because he goes to the opera." [...] McDiarmid compared the character to Iago from William Shakespeare's Othello: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon" [...] was the album's {{official}} lead single. It {{was chosen}} as a single by Interscope after Manson played an instrumental version of the song to their artists and repertoire department, where an employee exclaimed: [...] "This is gonna be a hit!". Manson {{is reported to have}} responded: [...] "Well, I'm glad <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> consideration for what I [...] put on top of it." [...] A heavily censored version of the profanity-laced track, re-titled to [...] "Arma... geddon", was serviced to radio in the US from April 13. It peaked at number 37 on Billboards Mainstream Rock, becoming their lowest-peaking single on that chart in the process. A music video, directed by Los Angeles-based filmmaker and photographer Delaney Bishop, premiered on the website of British music magazine NME on May 14. Delaney had previously directed the 2005 short film The Death of Salvador Dali, which starred Manson's ex-wife, Dita Von Teese.|$|E
2500|$|Runner {{up of the}} {{eleventh}} series, Vana Koutsomitis criticized the living conditions that candidates live in; granted they are accommodated in a lavish house, Vana claimed that the bosses impose living conditions similar to Big Brother - with strict rules and zero contact with outsiders. She said [...] "They just throw you into a house and tell you <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> phone, no internet and you’ll have no {{contact with the outside}} world, You can only talk to your family once a week for 10 minutes and that’s monitored. And we weren’t allowed to go to Boots to grab something. We had to be monitored and guided there." [...] She continued; [...] "I think that element of cabin fever and psychological torture is not necessary for a business competition. I don’t believe that you need to isolate people. I think you can gauge people’s business skills without putting them in that environment.|$|E

6000|$|... "The shame," [...] he answered, [...] "is all mine, or {{ought to}} be. But is it {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> suspicion?--I mean of late. Early, I know, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> none." ...|$|R

2500|$|Inayat Khan and Vera met at Manetta's, a {{restaurant}} in Clarges Street, Mayfair. Above all else, Vera wished to confirm that Inayat Khan believed in her own ability to succeed. Confidence {{was the most important}} thing for any agent. However poor Inayat Khan 's jumping or even her encoding, Vera knew that those agents who did well were those who knew before they set off that they could do the job. Her intention was to let Inayat Khan feel that she had an opportunity to back out gracefully should she so wish. Vera began by asking if she was happy in what she was doing. Inayat Khan looked startled and said: [...] "Yes, of course." [...] Vera then told her about the letter and its contents. Inayat Khan was upset that anybody should think she was not fit for the job. [...] "You know that if you have any doubts, it is not too late to turn back," [...] Vera said. [...] "If you don't feel you're the type–if for any reason whatever you don't want to go p you only have to tell me now. I'll arrange everything so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> embarrassment. You will be transferred to another branch of the service with no adverse mark on your file. We have every respect for the man or woman who admits frankly to not feeling up to it." [...] She ended by adding: [...] "For us there is only one crime: to go out there and let your comrades down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{hate the}} very name of John Caryll, Earl of Ostermore," [...] said he, [...] "as must every decent {{man who knows}} {{the truth of what}} the life of that satyr holds.

6000|$|... "All that I ask of you," [...] he pleaded, [...] "is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> tell {{me enough}} to {{convince}} me that my silence was justified. Tell me at least <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> knowledge of or share in that man's death!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{out with}} it. Let me have the real facts. Mind, I tell <b>you</b> fairly <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{right to tell}} him anything. What passed between us, passed in confidence. But let us hear what you did say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And not to you first, Fan? Poor Tom {{spoke to}} me because {{he was afraid to}} speak to you--afraid <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> such feeling for him as he wished <b>you</b> to <b>have.</b> He wanted sympathy and advice, and so the poor fellow came to me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'And {{what other}} should I give?' said the young man; 'do <b>you</b> think I <b>have</b> any {{occasion}} for an alias?

She {{appeared}} almost incredulous when I told her <b>that</b> <b>you</b> seldom came to London, and still more seldom went abroad. I wonder what she had in her head?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It means," [...] he said, [...] "that {{after you}} left I was in torment. I felt <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> one with <b>you</b> who could be of {{assistance}} supposing the worst happened.
