However, attempts to identify an underlying synchronization mechanism, and to accurately predict the expected synchroniza-tion delay (ESD), for even quite specific variable-length codes, {{appear to have been}} largely unsuccessful. The present paper explores a novel method for estimating the synchronization per-formance {{for a wide variety of}} variable-length codes, based on the <b>T-Codes.</b> <b>T-Codes</b> are a class of self-synchronizing codes, which typically synchronize within 2 – 3 codewords by a mechanism that derives from a recursive T-augmentation construction. It is observed that the T-Code mechanism for synchronization is followed, more or less, by other variable-length codes wherever substantial numbers of codewords are shared with a T-Code set. T-augmentation itself provides a means for assessing the contri-bution individual codewords make to the overall synchronization process for a T-Code set. Thus codeword differences between sets may be specifically evaluated to estimate the synchronization performance of a variable-length code set from a closely related T-Code set.

40|$|<b>T-codes</b> are variable-length self-synchronizing codes {{introduced}} by Titchener in 1984. T-code codewords are constructed recursively from a finite alphabet using an algorithm called T-augmentation, resulting in excellent self-synchronization properties. An algorithm called T-decomposition parses a given sequence {{into a series}} of T-prefixes, and finds a T-code set in which the sequence is encoded to a longest codeword. There are similarities and differences between T-decomposition and the conventional LZ 78 incremental parsing. The LZ 78 incremental parsing algorithm parses a given sequence into consecutive distinct subsequences (words) sequentially {{in such a way that}} each word consists of the longest matching word parsed previously and a literal symbol. Then, the LZ-complexity is defined as the number of words. By contrast, T-decomposition parses a given sequence {{into a series of}} T-prefixes, each of which consists of the recursive concatenation of the longest matching T-prefix parsed previously and a literal symbol, and it has to access the whole sequence every time it determines a T-prefix. Alike to the LZ-complexity, the T-complexity of a sequence is defined as the number of T-prefixes, however, the T-complexity of a particular sequence in general tends to be smaller than the LZ-complexity. In the first part of the thesis, we deal with our contributions to the theory of <b>T-codes.</b> In order to realize a sequential determination of T-prefixes, we devise a new T-decomposition algorithm using forward parsing. Both the T-complexity profile obtained from the forward T-decomposition and the LZ-complexity profile can be derived in a unified way using a differential equation method. The method focuses on the increase of the average codeword length of a code tree. The obtained formulas are confirmed to coincide with those of previous studies. The magnitude of the T-complexity of a given sequence s in general indicates the degree of randomness. However, there exist interesting sequences that have much larger T-complexities than any random sequences. We investigate the maximum T-complexity sequences and the maximum LZ-complexity sequences using various techniques including those of the test suite released by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the U. S. government, and find that the maximum T-complexity sequences are less random than the maximum LZ-complexity sequences. In the second part of the thesis, we present our achievements in terms of application. We consider two applications [...] data compression and randomness testing. First, we propose a new data compression scheme based on <b>T-codes</b> using a dictionary method such that all phrases added to a dictionary have a recursive structure similar to <b>T-codes.</b> Our data compression scheme can compress any of the files in the Calgary Corpus more efficiently than previous schemes based on <b>T-codes</b> and the UNIX compress, a variant of LZ 78 (LZW). Next, we introduce a randomness test based on the T-complexity. Recently, the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) randomness test based on the LZ-complexity was officially excluded from the NIST test suite. This is because the distribution of P-values for random sequences of length 106, the most common length used, is strictly discrete in the case of the LZ-complexity. Our test solves this problem because the T-complexity features an almost ideal uniform continuous distribution of P-values for random sequences of length 106. The proposed test outperforms the NIST LZ test, a modified LZ test proposed by Doganaksoy and Göloglu, and all other tests included in the NIST test suite, in terms of the detection of undesirable pseudorandom sequences generated by a multiplicative congruential generator (MCG) and non-random byte sequences Y = Y 0, Y 1, Y 2, ···, where Y 3 i and Y(3 i+ 1) are random, but Y(3 i+ 2) is given by Y 3 i + Y(3 i+ 1) mod 28. 報告番号: 甲 26141; 学位授与年月日: 2010 - 03 - 24; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(科学); 学位記番号: 博創域第 558 号; 研究科・専攻: 新領域創成科学研究科基盤科学研究系複雑理工学専...|$|E
