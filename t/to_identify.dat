5|$|Additionally, {{several studies}} have also {{utilized}} oligonucleotide usage patterns <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the differences across diverse microbial communities. Examples of such methodologies include the dinucleotide relative abundance approach by Willner et al. and the HabiSign approach of Ghosh et al. This latter study also indicated that differences in tetranucleotide usage patterns can be used <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> genes (or metagenomic reads) originating from specific habitats. Additionally some methods as TriageTools or Compareads detect similar reads between two read sets. The similarity measure they apply on reads {{is based on a}} number of identical words of length k shared by pairs of reads.|$|E
