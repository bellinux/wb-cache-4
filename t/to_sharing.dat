5|$|The {{defining}} {{dynamic characteristic}} of a planet {{is that it has}} cleared its neighborhood. A planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the planetesimals in its orbit. In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>sharing</b> its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This characteristic was mandated as part of the IAU's official definition of a planet in August, 2006. This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as Pluto, Eris and Ceres from full-fledged planethood, making them instead dwarf planets. Although to date this criterion only applies to the Solar System, a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs.|$|E

25|$|Covalent and ionic bonding form a continuum, with ionic {{character}} increasing {{with increasing}} {{difference in the}} electronegativity of the participating atoms. Covalent bonding corresponds <b>to</b> <b>sharing</b> {{of a pair of}} electrons between two atoms of essentially equal electronegativity (for example, C–C and C–H bonds in aliphatic hydrocarbons). As bonds become more polar, they become increasingly ionic in character. Metal oxides vary along the iono-covalent spectrum. The Si–O bonds in quartz, for example, are polar yet largely covalent, and are considered to be of mixed character.|$|E

25|$|A full {{container}} load (FCL) is an ISO {{standard container}} that is loaded and unloaded under the risk and account of one shipper and only one consignee. In practice, {{it means that the}} whole container is intended for one consignee. FCL container shipment tends to have lower freight rates than an equivalent weight of cargo in bulk. FCL is intended to designate a container loaded to its allowable maximum weight or volume, but FCL in practice on ocean freight does not always mean a full payload or capacity - many companies will prefer to keep a 'mostly' full container as a single container load to simplify logistics and increase security compared <b>to</b> <b>sharing</b> a container with other goods.|$|E

In the report, he mentioned Unomásuno, Diario Amanecer, and Aerolineas Amanecer, but gave no mention to his investment group Valgo Grupo de Inversión. He stated that it was likely that Mexican officials wanted to censor Unomásunos anti-organized crime publications by providing U.S. officials with false information to link them to drug trafficking and thereby discredit their information.

40|$|This study proposes {{and tests}} an {{integrative}} model {{to examine the}} relationships among customers’ willingness <b>to</b> <b>share</b> information, satisfaction, perceived value, and loyalty in a retailing context. This study extends research on customers’ willingness <b>to</b> <b>share</b> information from trust and privacy concerns toward key outcome measures such as perceived value, customer satisfaction, and loyalty, and is thus {{among the first to}} model customers’ willingness <b>to</b> <b>share</b> information with companies in robust theoretical retailing frameworks. The proposed relationships were tested using data from two retailing contexts – groceries (N = 429) and do-it-yourself (DIY) (N = 895). Findings from the two samples suggest that both perceived value and satisfaction are significant determinants of customers’ willingness <b>to</b> <b>share</b> information with a company. Although some differences emerge in the two studies, structural modeling largely supports the hypothesized framework and positions customers’ willingness <b>to</b> <b>share</b> information as an important antecedent of their loyalty intentions and behavior. This study provides practitioners with preliminary insight into the relationship between willingness <b>to</b> <b>share</b> information and perceived value, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty. This study advances retailing research, as {{it is one of the}} few empirical studies investigating the role of customers’ willingness <b>to</b> <b>share</b> information in driving loyalty and its relationship with perceived value and satisfaction in a retailing context...|$|R

25|$|When she {{got back}} to the United States she {{submitted}} a very thorough and insightful report to Congress. One of her recommendations was that Congress should create a new State Department Bureau for African Affairs to be overseen by a new {{assistant secretary of state for}} African affairs. Bolton helped to see that this did in fact happen, and Congress created the new bureau in 1958. In addition <b>to</b> <b>sharing</b> information about her trip with Congress through her official report, Bolton also made an impressive effort to enlighten the American people about the diversity of the African continent by creating a film about her trip, entitled Africa: Giant With a Future, 1955. This film is an excellent resource for students and instructors wanting a look at several African countries/colonies in the mid-1950s, and has been made available on DVD by the National Archives. In addition to educating Congress and the general public about Africa, Bolton's trip helped to begin the process of opening doors for women to play a major role in US foreign relations.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two major}} groups of TCAs in terms of {{chemical}} structure, which most, but not all, TCAs fall into. The groupings {{are based on the}} tricyclic ring system. They are the dibenzazepines (imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, lofepramine) and the dibenzocycloheptadienes (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, butriptyline). Minor TCA groups based on ring system include the dibenzoxepins (doxepin), the dibenzothiepines (dosulepin), and the dibenzoxazepines (amoxapine). In addition to classification based on the ring system, TCAs can also be usefully grouped {{based on the number of}} substitutions of the side chain amine. These groups include the tertiary amines (imipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, amitriptyline, butriptyline, doxepin, dosulepin) and the secondary amines (desipramine, nortriptyline, protriptyline). Lofepramine is technically a tertiary amine, but acts largely as a prodrug of desipramine, a secondary amine, and hence is more similar in profile to the secondary amines than to the tertiary amines. Amoxapine does not have the TCA side chain and hence is neither a tertiary nor secondary amine, although it is often grouped with the secondary amines due <b>to</b> <b>sharing</b> more in common with them.|$|E
