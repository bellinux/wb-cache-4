40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} global FX volatility and the excess returns to carry <b>trade</b> <b>portfolios.</b> We find a significantly negative return co-movement of high interest rate currencies with global volatility, whereas low interest rate currencies provide a hedge against volatility shocks.

Our results are robust to different proxies for volatility risk, and extend to other cross-sections such as individual currency returns and (some) momentum portfolios. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{develops}} no arbitrage {{results for}} trajectory based models by imposing general {{constraints on the}} <b>trading</b> <b>portfolios.</b> The main condition imposed, {{in order to avoid}} arbitrage opportunities, is a local continuity requirement on the final portfolio value considered as a functional on the trajectory space. The paper shows this to be a natural requirement by proving that a large class of practical trading strategies, defined by means of trajectory based stopping times, give rise to locally continuous functionals. The theory is illustrated, with some detail, for two specific trajectory models of practical interest. The implications for stochastic models which are not semimartingales are described. The present paper extends some of the results in [1] by incorporating in the formalism a larger set of <b>trading</b> <b>portfolios...</b>|$|R
40|$|Today's {{primarily}} mathematically oriented arbitrage theory {{does not}} address some economically important aspects of pricing. These are, first, the implicit conjecture that there is 'the' price of a portfolio, second, the exact formulation of no-arbitrage, price reproduction, and positivity of the pricing rule under short selling constraints, third, the explicit assumption of a nonnegative riskless interest rate, and fourth, the connection between arbitrage theory (that is almost universal pricing theory) and special pricing theories. Our article proposes the following answers to the above issues: The first problem can be solved by introducing the notion of 'physical' no-arbitrage, the second one by formulating the concept of 'actively' <b>traded</b> <b>portfolios</b> (that is non-dominated portfolios) and by requiring {{that there is a}} minimum price for actively <b>traded</b> <b>portfolios</b> and therefore for every admissible portfolio, and the third one by combining the 'invisible' asset 'cash' with the idea of actively <b>traded</b> <b>portfolios</b> - a riskless asset with a rate of return less than zero can never be actively traded in the presence of cash. Finally, the connection between arbitrage theory and special pricing theories ('law-of-one-price-oriented' and 'utility-oriented' pricing) consists in the fact that special pricing theories merely concretize arbitrage theory using different assumptions.

50|$|No {{definitive}} conclusions {{have been}} reached on {{the reasons behind}} the 1987 Crash.

Herd behavior and psychological feedback loops play a critical part in all stock market crashes but analysts have also tried to look for external triggering events. Aside from the general worries of stock market overvaluation, blame for the collapse has been apportioned to such factors as program <b>trading,</b> <b>portfolio</b> insurance and derivatives, and prior news of worsening economic indicators (i.e. a large U.S. merchandise trade deficit and a falling U.S. dollar, which seemed to imply future interest rate hikes).|$|E
