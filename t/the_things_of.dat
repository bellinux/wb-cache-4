Rhetoric like this became fiercer as events unfolded, and eventually stirred up a reaction in the Catholic establishment.|$|E
25|$|As the Istari were Maiar, {{each one}} served a Vala in some way. Saruman was the servant and helper of Aulë, and so learned {{much in the}} art of craftsmanship, mechanics, and metal-working, as was seen in the later Third Age. Gandalf was the servant of Manwë or Varda, but was a lover of the Gardens of Lórien, and so knew much of the hopes and dreams of Men and Elves. Radagast, servant of Yavanna, loved <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>of</b> nature, both Kelvar and Olvar. As each of these Istari learned from their Vala, so they acted in Middle-earth.|$|E
25|$|In Svithjod {{it was the}} old custom, as long as heathenism prevailed, {{that the}} chief {{sacrifice}} took place in Goe month at Upsala. Then sacrifice was offered for peace, and victory to the king; and thither came people {{from all parts of}} Svithjod. All <b>the</b> <b>Things</b> <b>of</b> the Swedes, also, were held there, and markets, and meetings for buying, which continued for a week: and after Christianity was introduced into Svithjod, the Things and fairs were held there as before. After Christianity had taken root in Svithjod, and the kings would no longer dwell in Upsala, the market-time was moved to Candlemas, and it has since continued so, and it lasts only three days.|$|E

500|$|Sierra Leone also {{encouraged}} Blair's policy of humanitarian intervention. Critics claimed that it led Blair to see military force as [...] "just another foreign policy option" [...] {{and that the}} apparent ease of the success shifted his focus towards {{the effectiveness of the}} use of force rather than the political and military risks. In his autobiography, Blair described the operation as one of the least-discussed aspects of his time in office but one of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>of</b> which he is most proud. He was keen to intervene in other African nations where civilian populations were at risk, particularly Darfur and Zimbabwe, but a lack of political support, combined with the pressure of large deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq after the 11 September attacks on the United States, prevented further interventions in Africa. It was not until 2011—when Operation Ellamy was launched as part of a multi-national intervention in Libya—that the United Kingdom undertook another military intervention in Africa.|$|E

[...] (The house stood until October 1711, when it was consumed in the great fire of Boston, after which the Old Corner Bookstore was built on the site.) The Hutchinsons soon were granted Taylor's Island in the Boston harbour, where they grazed their sheep, and they also acquired 600 acres of land at Mount Wollaston, [...] south of Boston in the area that later became Quincy. [...] Once established, William Hutchinson continued to prosper in the cloth trade, and made land purchases and investments. He became a town selectman and deputy to the General Court. Anne Hutchinson likewise fit into her new home with ease, devoting many hours to those who were ill or in need.

It states: [...] "Hugh Logan is a widower who lives with his only child, a little girl, in a small cottage in the country. Logan is a commercial traveler and, as the play opens, is preparing to leave on a business trip. He takes the train to the city, where he is attacked by footpads, who leave him unconscious in the roadway. He is found by Maud Neal and her father, who are passing in an auto, and they take him into their home. There he revives, but the shock has affected his memory, and {{he is unable to}} recall anything of his past life. The kindly Neal secures him employment, and as time passes Logan falls deeply in love with Maud. He finally proposes to her and it is accepted. In the meantime, little May has been waiting in vain for her father. As no word is received from him, and she has no other relatives, Bridget, the servant, takes her to the orphan asylum, where she is compelled to make her home with other little unfortunates. May dislikes the place. In the end she escapes from it. But, gaining the city, she gets lost there and, tired and hungry, goes to sleep on a doorstep - the Neals'. There she is found by Maud, who takes her into the house. Maud is much attracted by the child's charms and finally decides that she must never be parted from her. She tells Logan of her decision and he objects. They quarrel. Feeling himself in the wrong, Logan returns and asks Maud's pardon. He meets May, who recognizes her father. At the sight of her, his memory returns. Speedily he determines to retain May from out of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>of</b> the old life, and Maud from out of the new." ...|$|E

The setting for the first prediction is somewhere near Caesarea Philippi, immediately after Peter proclaims Jesus as the Messiah. Jesus tells his followers that [...] "the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and {{that he must be}} killed and after three days rise again".
