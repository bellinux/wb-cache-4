The leading figures of this practice were local intellectuals called rapsods related the mythistory of kurbet before World War II with the migration.

This became a tool for responding to the loss of life for the tragedy of Otranto and other tragic events.|$|E
5|$|The {{date was}} changed {{once more to}} August 3, before it was finally {{released}} in stores on August 24, 1995, {{the same day as}} the Microsoft's operating system Windows 95 version. Phantasmagoria came out first for Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS, then for Macintosh computers in November 1995. A hint book by Sierra came out {{at the same time as}} the game. Phantasmagoria was also ported to Sega Saturn and spanned eight discs exclusively in Japan, where it was fully translated and dubbed into Japanese, and released by Outrigger under the name Phantasm. In response to all the delays, Vince Broady, executive editor of the monthly publication Multimedia World, said Sierra may have been attempting to avoid the same mistakes from the previous year with Outpost, for which the company released many advertisements and reviews, but then over-promoted and released before it was finished. Sierra spokeswoman Kathy Gillmore admitted that mistakes were made in marketing Outpost and Sierra had tried <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>them.</b> The minimum system requirements were an IBM compatible 486–25, 8 megabytes of RAM, 5 megabytes hard disk space, SVGA (256 colors) and a 2x CD-ROM. It supported Sound Blaster-compatible sound cards, and for MS-DOS the game worked with a megahertz chip. It sold for as much as $80 in some stores, but was typically sold for $69.95.|$|E

25|$|On {{the next}} day, Peck's train was ambushed {{again in the}} same area as before. This time, the Chinese had torn up about 400 yards or the {{railroad}} tracks, and the workers sent <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>them</b> had been killed or wounded by land mines. Since it was expected that repair work on the railroad would take at least two days, Peck returned to Tangshan and boarded an observation plane, in order to fly to Chinwangtao. The Kuyeh incident demonstrated the need for a strong Nationalist offensive action to clear the railroad line, and to arrange this, General Peck was authorized to deal directly with Lieutenant General Tu Li-ming, who was the commanding general in the Northeast China Command. Li-ming agreed to drive back the Communists and avoid Marine positions while doing so, in order to keep American forces out of the conflict. The Marines, in turn, would help release Nationalist troops for the operation by assuming responsibility for guarding all rail bridges over 100 meters long between Tangku and Chinwangtao, a distance of approximately 135 miles. Even before taking on these new responsibilities, the 7th Marines was short on manpower. As a result, 1st Battalion, 29th Marines, 6th Division, was transferred from Tsingtao to Hopeh and placed under the 7th Marines' operational control.|$|E

[...] Succumbing to stage fright, however, Stewie wets himself, and begins crying, with Peter recording it all on video tape. Panning the camera down to another row in the auditorium, Peter notices actor Richard Dreyfuss, and begins recording him, while pestering him with personal questions. Deciding to sell the video to TMZ, Peter quickly becomes enthralled with being a Paparazzi, and decides to buy a professional-grade video camera. He then begins recording other town celebrities, including Tom Tucker, Mayor Adam West, and Ollie Williams, the latter whom smashes Peter's camera, {{as well as his}} glasses. Unable <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>them</b> in time for work the next day, he decides to wear contacts instead. Once he arrives at work, his boss, Angela, notices something different about his appearance and develops a sexual attraction for him. Angela begins hitting on Peter, enlisting him to do various odd sexual favors for her. This culminates in her inviting Peter to her house one evening, which Peter realizes as an attempt to have sex with him. Peter fears of going against her will result in being fired, and agrees to visit Angela. He then enlists his neighbor, Quagmire, to go with him, and hides inside Peter's clothing, planning to have sex with Angela, in the place of Peter. He soon backs out, however, when he finds Angela to be unattractive, leading Peter to have to refuse to have sex with her, and eventually being fired from his job.|$|E

40|$|Significant {{inaccuracy}} often {{occurs during}} the process of mathematical calculation due to the digit limitation of floating point, which may lead to catastrophic loss. Normally, people believe that adjustment of floating-point precision is an effective way to solve this problem, since high-precision floating-point has more digits to store information. Thus, it is a prevalent method to reduce the inaccuracy in much floating-point related research, that performing all the operations with higher precision. However, we discover that some operations may lead to larger error in higher precision. In this paper, we define this kind of operation that generates large error due to precision adjustment a precision-specific operation. Furthermore, we propose a light-weight searching algorithm for detecting precision-specific operations and figure out an automatic processing method <b>to</b> <b>fixing</b> <b>them.</b> In addition, we conducted an experiment on the scientific mathematical library of GLIBC.
