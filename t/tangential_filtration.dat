40|$|The {{proteins}} and polar lipids present in milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) fragments are gaining attention for their technological and nutritional properties. These MFGM fragments are preferentially enriched in side streams of the dairy industry, like butter serum, buttermilk, and whey. The {{objective of this}} study was to recover MFGM fragments from whey by <b>tangential</b> <b>filtration</b> techniques. Acid buttermilk cheese whey was chosen as a source for purification by tangential membrane filtration because it is relatively rich in MFGM-fragments and because casein micelles are absent. Polyethersulfone and cellulose acetate membranes of different pore sizes were evaluated on polar lipid and MFGM-protein retention upon filtration at 40 degrees C. All fractions were analyzed for dry matter, ash, lipids, proteins, reducing sugars, polar lipid content by HPLC, and for the presence of MFGM proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE. A fouling coefficient was calculated. It was found that a thermocalcic aggregation whey pretreatment was very effective in the clarification of the whey, but resulted in low permeate fluxes and high retention of ash and whey proteins. By means of an experimental design, the influence of pH and temperature on the fouling and the retention of polar lipids (and thus MFGM fragments), proteins, and total lipids upon microfiltration with 0. 15 mu M cellulose acetate membrane was investigated. All models were highly significant, and no outliers were observed. By increasing the pH from 4. 6 to 7. 5, polar lipid retention at 50 degrees C increased from 64 to 98 %, whereas fouling of the filtration membrane was minimized. A 3 -step diafiltration of acid whey under these conditions resulted in a polar lipid concentration of 6. 79 g/ 100 g of dry matter. As such, this study shows that <b>tangential</b> <b>filtration</b> techniques are suited for the purification of MFGM fragments...|$|E

The performance of different separation methods for the recovery of cell biomass of marine microalgae, Chaetoceros calcitrans, from the culture broth was evaluated. The microalgae were cultivated using 10 L photobioreactor. The microalgae cell cultures were concentrated either by centrifugation, <b>tangential</b> flow <b>filtration</b> or flocculation and then stored at different temperatures (- 20, 4 and 27 °C) to investigate the optimum storage conditions for C. calcitrans prior to different downstream processing methods. High concentration of cell in slurry (4. 88 x 10 7 cells mL - 1) was obtained using centrifugation as compared to <b>tangential</b> flow <b>filtration</b> (4. 14 x 10 7 cells mL - 1), flocculation with chitosan (1. 56 x 10 7 cells mL - 1) and flocculation with Magnafloc ® LT 25 (8. 24 x 10 6 cells mL - 1).

40|$|Polymeric {{nanoparticles}} {{are potential}} candidates as carriers for pharmaceutical agents. Development of such nanoparticles generally requires molecules immobilized on the particle surfaces to ensure biocompatibility and/or targeting abilities. Following particle preparation and surface modification, excess reagents must be removed. Ultracentrifugation, {{which is the}} most widely used purification technique as per today, is not feasible in industrial applications. In this diploma work, <b>tangential</b> flow <b>filtration</b> is studied as an alternative purification method which is better suited for implementation in a large-scale process. Comparison of ultracentrifugation and <b>tangential</b> flow <b>filtration</b> in diafiltration mode for purification of nanoparticles, indicate that they are comparable with respect to particle stability and the removal of the surfactant SDS from methacrylic anhydride nanoparticles. The purification efficiency of <b>tangential</b> flow <b>filtration</b> is superior to that of ultracentrifugation. Conductivity measurements of filtrates and supernatant liquids show that a stable conductivity value can be reached 6 times faster in filtration than in centrifugation with equipment and settings used. This conductivity arises from several types of molecules, and the contribution from surfactant molecules alone is not known. However, protein adsorption on the particles indicates successful removal of surfactant. Conductivity and tensiometry were evaluated as potential methods to quantify surfactant in solutions, but both proved unsatisfactory. Using bovine serum albumin as a model protein, the extent of immobilization to nanoparticles is evaluated at different pH. A maximum amount of 6, 8 mg/m 2 is immobilized, whereof an unknown part is covalently bound. This coverage is achieved at pH 4, 0 and is probably partly due to low electrostatic repulsion between particle and protein. An estimation of 2, 0 µmol covalently bound BSA per gram of nanoparticles corresponds to 5, 3 mg/m 2 and a surface coverage of 76 %. Removal of excess reagents after surface modification is done with ultracentrifugation instead of filtration, as particle aggregates present after the immobilization reaction might foul the membrane...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1960 's {{when the}} first {{waterborne}} outbreaks of Giardia were reported in America, it has been recognised as a disease causing organism. From these outbreaks the USA Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed a method for testing large volumes of water for Giardia cysts, this was adapted into the 16 th edition of the Standard Methods. To test the method cultured cysts were required for spiked trials. A published method of encystation by Schupp et al (1988) was investigated as a potential source of cysts. Morphologically correct cysts were gained in the greatest number at 37 °C over 72 hours at a bile concentration of 5 g/l. Using cultured cysts and cysts from animals and water, viability and the least number needed to iniate a culture were assessed. When 10 of the cysts produced in vitro were excysted {{it was possible to}} obtain a culture. For cysts from animal and water origins at levels up to 10, 000 cysts, {{it was not possible to}} obtain cultures. Variations of the Standard Method of water testing for Giardia had been reported by different laboratories. We investigated the sensitivity of this method using some of the reported variations such as staining on a membrane filter, the use of monoclonal antibody stains and methods of washing cysts free of the sampling core. We found the method could detect to the 5 x 10 2 cysts/ 5001 of water, a recovery of 10 %. The recoveries obtained over a range of cysts spiked was between 10 - 40 %. An alternative method to sampling and processing the sample was <b>tangential</b> <b>filtration.</b> Four <b>tangential</b> <b>filtration</b> units were compared to the concentration techiques of centrifugation and sedimentation (these were those used in the Standard Method). The <b>tangential</b> <b>filtration</b> units were found not to be as sensitive as centrifugation and sedimentation. They also presented difficulties with particulate matter or sediment. When compared to the sampling method, the unit was unable to concentrate the 5001 of tap water due to the sediment levels. Staining methods were evaluated. Slide staining was compared to staining on a filter, the filter method was found to give a better recovery. Comparison between commercially available monoclonal antibody stain, a polyclonal antibody stain and Lugols iodine stain, found that the monoclonal and polyclonal antibody stains lead to easier identification by illuminating the cyst (it still had to be checked for internal morphology) than the iodine stain. The monoclonal antibody stains were found to be more specific than the polyclonal stain. Methods of inactivating the antigens recognised by the monoclonal antibody stain persist so cross contamination between samples was investigated. Hypochlorite concentrations of 4 % and higher over 20 minutes were found to inactivate the antigen recognised. Other chemicals were compared but none were found to inactivate the antigen. A study of a family infected with Giardia was undertaken, to test methods used in the laboratory and study modes of transmission. Giardia cysts were found in the river that supplied the farm tank but not in the tank itself. The house tank also tested negative for Giardia.

40|$|Purpose. The study reports {{evaluation}} of different purification processes for removing surplus surfactant and formulating stable nanoparticle dispersions. Methods. Nanoparticle formulations prepared from poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were purified by a diafiltration centrifugal device (DCD), using 300 K and 100 K molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) membranes and a <b>tangential</b> flow <b>filtration</b> (TFF) {{system with a}} 300 K MWCO membrane. The effects of process parameters including MWCO, transmembrane pressure (TMP), and mode of TFF on nanoparticle purification were evaluated, and two purification techniques were compared to the commonly used ultracentrifugation technique. Results. Both DCD and TFF systems (concentration mode at TMP of 10 psi) with 300 K MWCO membrane removed maximal percent PVA from nanoparticle dispersions (89. 0 and 90. 7 %, respectively). T 90, the time taken to remove 90 % of PVA in 200 -ml sample, however, was considerably different (9. 6 and 2. 8 h, respectively). Purified nanoparticle dispersions were stable and free of aggregation at ambient conditions over 3 days. This {{is in contrast to}} the ultracentrifugation technique, which, although it can yield a highly purified sample, suffers from drawbacks of a level of irreversible nanoparticle aggregation and loss of fine particles in the supernatant during centrifugation. Conclusions. The TFF, in concentration mode at TMP of 10 psi, is a relatively quick, efficient, and cost-effective technique for purification and concentration of a large nanoparticle batch (Q 200 ml). The DCD technique can be an alternative purification method for nanoparticle dispersions of small volumes.

This material, which may have been protein-based, was present in the starch-milk produced using the pilot-scale method but not the laboratory-scale method, and its presence determined the final protein content of the diafiltered concentrate.

The study used urine from donors with known skin test reactions to purified protein derivative of Seiberts (PPD-S) and coccidoidin immitis (cocci). For the first study, a forty-eight hour catch of urine and bovine leukocytes were divided into aliquots and processed using dual acetone precipitation followed by dialysis through a 6, 000 molecular weight cut off membrane under negative pressure for 4 to 5 days to extract the TF-like substance. Results confirmed that TF activity could be derived from human urine, and that this procedure could be used with blood to extract TF. In the second study, <b>tangential</b> flow <b>filtration</b> combined with stirred cell final filtration and dual acetone precipitation required only 10 hours to produce TF activity nearly identical to the first study.

The results obtained for the local transmembrane flux and the concentration boundary layer thickness were compared against others in literature. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|International audienceA {{study has}} been {{undertaken}} of an advanced wastewater treatment approach using polymer nanofiltration membranes, {{in an attempt to}} obtain water of sufficient quality to allow it to be reused in the same production process or, alternatively, to be discharged without any problems. The study has initially focused on the removal of organic matter (reduction of COD) and the most representative ions present in the wastewater, such as Na+, Mg 2 +, Cl-, and SO 42 -. In a first part of the study, with a view to optimising the experimental phase, a simulation has been performed of the nanofiltration process using the NanoFlux software. Among other things, the simulation allows the most suitable membranes to be selected {{as a function of the}} permeate flow rate and desired level of retention in the substances to be removed. The subsequent experimentation was carried out in a laboratory <b>tangential</b> <b>filtration</b> system that works with flat membranes. It was found that retention values of about 90 % were obtained for the studied substances, with a good permeate flow rate, using low operating pressures. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the studied technology and its potential as a treatment for improving ceramic industry wastewater quality...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSize {{fractionation}} {{was performed}} using {{water from the}} Great Reef of Toliara (Madagascar) taken from two different habitats (ocean and lagoon) during the dry and wet seasons, to study the growth and mortality rates of bacterioplankton. Experiments were conducted with 1 and 100 % of heterotrophic nanoflagellate (HNF) concentrations and virus-free water was obtained by <b>tangential</b> <b>filtration</b> (10 kDa). During the dry season, in both environments, bacterial abundance and production were significantly lower than values recorded during the wet season. Bacterial growth rates without grazers were 0. 88 day– 1 in the lagoon and 0. 58 day– 1 in the ocean. However, growth rates were statistically higher without grazers and viruses (1. 58 day– 1 and 1. 27 day– 1). An estimate of virus-induced bacterial mortality revealed the important role played by viruses in the lagoon (0. 70 day– 1) and the ocean (0. 69 day– 1). During the wet season, bacterial growth rates without grazers were significantly higher in both environments than were values obtained in the dry season. However, the bacterial growth rates were paradoxally lower {{in the absence of}} viruses than with viruses in both environments. Our results suggest that changes in nutrient concentrations can {{play an important role in}} the balance between viral lysis and HNF grazing in the bacterial mortality. However, virus-mediated bacterial mortality is likely to act simultaneously with nanoflagellates pressure in their effects on bacterial communities...|$|E
40|$|High {{performance}} <b>tangential</b> flow <b>filtration</b> (HPTFF) is {{an emerging}} technology {{developed from the}} conventional cross flow filtration (CFF). HPTFF could separate protein components that differ less than three fold in size compared to the CFF, which only applicable to separate the protein components that differ more than tenfold in size. In the current study, HPTFF was operated using PES membrane with MWCO of 30 kDa to separate whey protein components into two fractions which is enriched in α-lactalbumin (α-lac) on the permeate side and β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) in the retentate side. In order to get higher permeate value of α-lac, ionic strength of the solution from 0 M to 0. 5 M in HPTFF was studied in this study. The best separation factor was observed at intermediate salt concentration of 0. 125 M concentration...|$|R
40|$|In industry, when an {{operation}} of separation, concentration, purification or sterilisation is necessary, the membrane processes can be applied. Into the food industry, the tangential process {{is used for}} many sectors (milk, gelatine, vinegar, juice, wine [...] .)

40|$|Surfactin is a {{bacterial}} lipopeptide produced by Bacillus subtilis {{and is a}} powerful surfactant, having also antiviral, antibacterial and antitumor properties. The recovery and purification of surfactin from complex fermentation broths is a major obstacle to its commercialization; therefore, a two-step membrane filtration process was developed using a lab scale <b>tangential</b> flow <b>filtration</b> (TFF) unit with 10 kDa MWCO regenerated cellulose (RC) and polyethersulfone (PES) membranes at three different transmembrane pressure (TMP) of 1. 5 bar, 2. 0 bar and 2. 5 bar. Two modes of filtrations were studied, with and without cleaning of membranes prior to UF- 2. In a first step of ultrafiltration (UF- 1), surfactin was retained effectively by membranes at above its critical micelle concentration (CMC); subsequently in UF- 2, the retentate micelles were disrupted by addition of 50...|$|R
