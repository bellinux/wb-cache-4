5|$|The {{construction}} of the French cemeteries was complicated by even more heated arguments over how {{the bodies of the}} war dead should be dealt with. During the conflict the French war dead had ended up being split between special war cemeteries, local civilian cemeteries and some had been returned <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>original</b> villages. Catholic traditionalists in the government called for the bodies to be buried together in special cemeteries along the Western front, while others campaigned for them to be returned to local cemeteries. In 1919, the decision was taken to use special war cemeteries and to ban the repatriation of bodies, but by 1920 this decision had been reversed and 300,000 French bodies were repatriated <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>original</b> homes. The French war cemeteries were typically much larger than their IWGC equivalents and used concrete Catholic crosses for all the graves, {{with the exception of the}} Islamic and Chinese war dead.|$|E

5|$|After {{a failure}} to {{assimilate}} Indigenous children by early missionaries in the 17th century, educational programs were not widely attempted again by religious officials until the 1820s, prior {{to the introduction of}} state-sanctioned operations. Included among them was a school established by John West, an Anglican missionary, at the Red River Colony in what is today Manitoba. Protestant missionaries also opened residential schools in the current Ontario region, spreading Christianity and working to encourage Indigenous peoples to adopt subsistence agriculture as a way to ensure they would not return <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>original,</b> nomadic ways of life upon graduation.|$|E

The Doctor releases the energy lifeforms on the holodeck; in kind, the missing crew are returned <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>original</b> forms. Afterwards, upon reflection, the Doctor decides not to keep the name Schweitzer, as his memories associated with it are too painful.|$|E

5|$|In his {{cross-examination}} {{of the two}} doctors, Duchesne {{cited the}} psychological reports filed on Lamb at Penetanguishene in 1966, which had determined Lamb to have an IQ of 125, far above most of his 18-year-old peers. The prosecutor proposed {{that it was not}} beyond Lamb, with his psychopathic personality and high level of intelligence, to invent a story of amnesia and confusion to avoid responsibility for satisfying his dangerous impulses by consciously killing people. Both Yaworsky and Dolan said that although this was possible, they were each sticking <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>original</b> conclusions made in the days following the incident.|$|E

In other words, a fermion needs to be rotated 720° before returning to its original state.|$|E
