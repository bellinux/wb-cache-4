5|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{studied at}} Plato's Academy in Athens, {{remaining}} <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> 17 years. Like Plato, he sought universals in his philosophy, but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed observation, notably {{of the natural}} history of the island of Lesbos and the marine life in the island's lagoon at Pyrrha. This study made him the earliest natural historian whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on zoology was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some two thousand years. His writings on zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work. Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus later wrote a similar book on botany, Enquiry into Plants.|$|E
5|$|The United States Senate {{inquiry into}} {{the sinking of the}} RMS Titanic was opened at the hotel on April 19, 1912 and {{continued}} <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time in the Myrtle Room, before moving on to Washington, D.C.. John Jacob Astor IV {{was one of the people}} who perished on its ill-fated journey. Seven senators were present on the subcommittee, including William Alden Smith (Republican, Michigan) as chair, Jonathan Bourne (Republican, Oregon), Theodore E. Burton (Republican, Ohio), Duncan U. Fletcher (Democrat, Florida), Francis G. Newlands (Democrat, Nevada), George Clement Perkins (Republican, California), and Furnifold McLendel Simmons (Democrat, North Carolina). The composition of the subcommittee was carefully chosen to represent the conservative, moderate and liberal wings of the two parties.|$|E

5|$|Villani {{was sent}} on another {{diplomatic}} mission in 1329, {{this time to}} Bologna to meet Cardinal Bertrand de Pouget. From 1330 to 1331 he superintended the making of Andrea Pisano's bronze doors for the Baptistry. At the same time, he served as the consul for his guild of the Arte di Calimala and watched over the raising of the campanile of the Badìa. He was also sent with others as a hostage to Ferrara, to ensure that Florence made good on a debt; he resided <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> months in 1341.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} at the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald {{managed to escape}} {{with the aid of}} Rögnvald Brusason (later Earl of Orkney) to a remote farm in Eastern Norway. He stayed <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time to heal his wounds, and {{thereafter}} (possibly up to a month later) journeyed north over the mountains to Sweden. A year after the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald arrived in Kievan Rus' (referred to in the sagas as Garðaríki or Svíþjóð hin mikla). He likely spent at least part of his time in the town of Staraya Ladoga (Aldeigjuborg), arriving there {{in the first half of}} 1031. Harald and his men were welcomed by Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise, whose wife Ingegerd was a distant relative of Harald. Badly in need of military leaders, Yaroslav recognised a military potential in Harald and made him a captain of his forces. Harald's brother Olaf Haraldsson had previously been in exile to Yaroslav following the revolt in 1028, and Morkinskinna says that Yaroslav embraced Harald first and foremost because he was the brother of Olaf. Harald took part in Yaroslav's campaign against the Poles in 1031, and possibly also fought against other 1030s Kievan enemies and rivals such as the Chudes in Estonia, the Byzantines, as well as the Pechenegs and other steppe nomad people.|$|E
5|$|Few {{people in}} London {{other than their}} close friends knew that the couple were not married. Hogg's family had heard rumours that he was {{planning}} to marry, and had been curious to know whom he had chosen. They were very upset after hearing of his plans for a union with Jane. His mother was unwilling to introduce Jane to their social circles as Mrs Hogg, which ensured that she would never visit them. Hogg did not enter his family's house in Durham for seven years after he informed them of his relationship with Jane. Word of their union spread throughout Durham, and Hogg stopped practising law <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time because of the damage to his reputation. Several of their friends were supportive of their union. Mary Shelley particularly approved of their match, despite having earlier been jealous of the time Hogg had spent with Jane.|$|E

5|$|Public {{perception}} of the national flag varies. Historically, both Western and Japanese sources claimed the flag was a powerful and enduring symbol to the Japanese. Since the end of World War II (the Pacific War), {{the use of the}} flag and the national anthem Kimigayo has been a contentious issue for Japan's public schools. Disputes about their use have led to protests and lawsuits. The flag is not frequently displayed in Japan due to its association with ultranationalism. To Okinawans, the flag represents the events of World WarII and the subsequent U.S. military presence <b>there.</b> <b>For</b> <b>some</b> nations that have been occupied by Japan, the flag is a symbol of aggression and imperialism. The Hi no maru was used as a tool against occupied nations for purposes of intimidation, asserting Japan's dominance, or subjugation. Several military banners of Japan are based on the Hi no maru, including the sunrayed Naval Ensign. The Hi no maru also serves as a template for other Japanese flags in public and private use.|$|E

25|$|Reverend William Whateley (1583–1639), {{whose father}} was several times bailiff or mayor of Banbury, was a notable Banbury vicar, who was instituted in 1610 but had already been a 'lecturer' <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> years. In 1626 Whateley refused communion to his own brother, who had been {{presented}} for religious incompetence. A report by the church wardens in 1619 {{said he was a}} well liked and tolerant priest.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the mainstream views, the Hindu revivalist movements denied an external origin to Aryans. Dayananda Saraswati, {{the founder of the}} Arya Samaj (Society of Aryans), held that Vedas were the source of all knowledge that were revealed to the Aryans. The first man (an Aryan) was created in Tibet and, after living <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time, the Aryans came down and inhabited India, which was devoid of any people earlier.|$|E

25|$|Later in 1885 Joubert again {{offered his}} {{services}} to Lavigerie, {{and this was}} accepted in a letter of 20 February 1886. Joubert reached Zanzibar on 14 June 1886, and reached the mission at Karema on 22 November 1886. He remained <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> months {{at the request of}} the Vicar Apostolic, Mgr.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 21 December 1820.|$|E
25|$|After an {{extended}} period of increasing decrepitude, the final passenger service of two trains each way on weekdays (down from three) ran on 30 October 1948 following the nationalisation of British Railways. Freight services from Eastry to Port Richborough ceased officially on 27 October 1949 (although no train had run <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time and track was missing on the river bridge), west of Eastry on 25 July 1950 and north of Tilmanstone Colliery on 1 March 1951.|$|E
25|$|In 1763, when Great Britain {{took control}} of Florida, the {{community}} of Spaniards and Native Americans were moved to Havana. Florida returned to Spanish control 20 years later, {{but there was no}} official resettlement of the island.

While claimed by Spain, no nation exercised de facto control over the community <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time.|$|E
