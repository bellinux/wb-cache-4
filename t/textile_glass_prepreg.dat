40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{tests of}} samples of basalt and <b>textile</b> <b>glass</b> {{reinforcement}} were performed within {{the solution of}} the research project GAČR 13 - 12676 S and SGS 14 / 171 /OHK 1 / 2 T/ 31. These tests were carried out because of the need to establish elementary mechanical quantities that are tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of non-conventional reinforcement. Both of these quantities are required for further modeling of structures and for designing of the elements made from textile reinforced concrete (TRC) as not being provided by reinforcement manufacturers. The tests were carried out on a total of 12 samples of reinforcement where the first 6 samples were made from <b>textile</b> <b>glass</b> reinforcement (AR-G = Alkali-Resistant Glass) and the remaining 6 samples were prepared from basalt reinforcement.

40|$|Abstract. A hybrid {{finite element}} {{discrete}} mesoscopic approach {{is used to}} model the forming of composite parts using a unidirectional <b>glass</b> <b>prepreg</b> non-crimp fabric (NCF). The tensile behavior of the fabric is represented using 1 -D beam elements, and the shearing behavior is captured using 2 -D shell elements in an Abaqus/Explicit finite element model via a user-defined material subroutine. The forming of a hemisphere is simulated using a finite element model of the fabric, {{and the results are}} compared to a thermostamped part as a demonstration of the capabilities of the used methodology. Forming simulations using a double-dome geometry, which has been used in an international benchmarking program, are then performed with the validated finite element model to explore the ability of the unidirectional fabric to accommodate the presence of interlaminate cabling...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a light-weight composite Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) airframe incorporating a novel foam grid based design into <b>Glass</b> <b>prepreg</b> composites is presented. Various combinations of advanced materials are judiciously utilized in different structural configurations to realize diverse requirements in the airframe. Advanced manufacturing techniques such as rapid prototyping, water jet cutting and autoclave curing ensure accurate conformance to the complex contour as well as precise tailored distribution of structural mass. The foam grid based design approach using Glass composites ensures low mass, provides stiffness in multiple directions, imparts crashworthy features and eliminates the problem of electrical leakages. Good correlation between analysis and static test measurement of wing deformation is found. Various issues in the {{development of}} a lightweight MAV airframe pertaining to design, tooling, fabrication, testing and analysis are discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA new {{approach}} and material architecture {{is presented in}} order to overcome the inherent brittleness and unstable failure characteristic of conventional high performance composites. The concept {{is the use of}} thin-ply hybrid laminates. Fracture mechanics calculations were carried out to determine the critical carbon layer thickness for stable pull-out in a three layer unidirectional hybrid laminate, which can provide a pseudo-ductile failure. Unidirectional hybrid composites were fabricated by sandwiching various numbers of thin carbon prepreg plies between standard thickness <b>glass</b> <b>prepreg</b> plies and tested in tension. Specimens with one and two plies of thin carbon prepreg produced pseudo-ductile failure, whereas ones with three and four plies failed with unstable delamination. An explanation of the different failure modes is given in terms of the different energy release rates for delamination in various specimens. The observed damage characteristics agreed well with the expectations according to the estimated critical carbon layer thickness...|$|R

5000|$|... "Fibreglass {{reinforced}} plastics" [...] or FRPs (commonly {{referred to}} simply as fibreglass) use <b>textile</b> grade <b>glass</b> fibres. These <b>textile</b> fibres {{are different from}} other forms of glass fibres used to deliberately trap air, for insulating applications (see <b>glass</b> wool). <b>Textile</b> <b>glass</b> fibres begin as varying combinations of SiO2, Al2O3, B2O3, CaO, or MgO in powder form. These mixtures are then heated through direct melting to temperatures around 1300 degrees Celsius, after which dies are used to extrude filaments of glass fibre in diameter ranging from 9 to 17 µm. These filaments are then wound into larger threads and spun onto bobbins for transportation and further processing. Glass fibre {{is by far the}} most popular means to reinforce plastic and thus enjoys a wealth of production processes, some of which are applicable to aramid and carbon fibres as well owing to their shared fibrous qualities.|$|R
