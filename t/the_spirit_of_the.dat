5|$|After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, a {{representative}} of the Fidel Castro government asked Árbenz to come to Cuba, to which he readily agreed, sensing an opportunity to live with fewer restrictions on himself. He flew to Havana in July 1960, and, caught up in <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recent revolution, began to participate in public events. His presence so close to Guatemala once again increased the negative coverage he received in the Guatemalan press. He was offered the leadership of some revolutionary movements in Guatemala but refused, as he was pessimistic about the outcome.|$|E
50|$|A major plot {{point in}} the trilogies (first {{described}} in Helliconia Spring, and explained in detail in Helliconia Winter) is <b>the</b> changing character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pauk experience for <b>the</b> Helliconian humans. <b>The</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead are extremely emotional, and are naturally bitter and angry towards <b>the</b> visiting <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living. After the Helliconian civilisations become <b>of</b> interest to <b>the</b> Earth humans, a planet-wide effort on Earth is made to psychically transmit empathic energy from Gaia to the Original Beholder, {{in an effort to}} lend their support to the humans on Helliconia. This effort has a positive effect on <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead Helliconian humans, making them uniformly happy and nurturing to <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living.|$|R

5|$|Doom {{was well}} {{received}} by critics and players. The single-player campaign, graphics, and gameplay received considerable acclaim and praise, with reviewers crediting {{the game for}} recapturing <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classic Doom games and first-person shooters of the 1990s, whereas the multiplayer mode drew the most significant criticism. It was the second best-selling video game in North America and the UK {{a few weeks after}} its release, and sold over 500,000 copies for PCs within the same period.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, a {{combination}} of financial pressure and low enrollment forced the Danish-language based Danebod Folk School to close down.

Danebod Folk Camp offers Danish cuisine, Danish folk dance, Danish art, and other Danish cultural experiences. In <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Danish Folk School system, camp attendees sing Danish songs, dance traditional Danish folk dance, work on crafts and have Danish-based lectures throughout the day.|$|E

5|$|Hari Damle (Sachin Khedekar), {{head of a}} Chitpavan Bramhin family, {{lives in}} the village Torgaon in Konkan with his wife Tara (Medha Manjrekar), their three children, his younger brother Mahadev (Abhijit Kelkar), and his widowed aunt, Namu Aatya (Savita Malpekar). Hari {{arranges}} the marriage of Mahadev with a pre-pubescent girl, Durga (Ketaki Mategaonkar), renamed as Uma after marriage. However, Mahadev dies before the consummation of the marriage. Hari performs death rituals (Śrāddha) for Mahadev but crows (symbolic of <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased in Hinduism) refuse to touch the offerings. Hari mumbles something while offering food after which crow touches the offerings.|$|E

5|$|In 1495 the Italian Renaissance {{arrived in}} France, {{imported}} by King Charles VIII after his invasion of Italy. A factor that promoted {{the spread of}} secularism was {{the inability of the}} Church to offer assistance against the Black Death. Francis I imported Italian art and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, and built ornate palaces at great expense. Writers such as François Rabelais, Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay and Michel de Montaigne, painters such as Jean Clouet, and musicians such as Jean Mouton also borrowed from <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Renaissance.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, in <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation's centennial celebrations, Stanton and Susan B.

They invited Lucy Stone to help, but Stone declined {{to be part of}} the project; she was of the opinion that Stanton and Anthony would not fairly portray the divisive split between NWSA and American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). Stanton and Anthony wrote without her and, in 1881, they published the first volume of the History of Woman Suffrage, and placed themselves at each of its most important events, marginalizing Stone's contribution.|$|E

But these assurances against a Jacobite restoration (which he had been taking out since the early years of WilliamIII, no matter how insincere), stirred Hanoverian suspicions, and perhaps prevented him from holding the first place in the counsels of the future GeorgeI.|$|E
