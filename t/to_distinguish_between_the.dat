5|$|A yoga {{system that}} predated the Buddhist school is Jain yoga. But since Jain sources postdate Buddhist ones, it is {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> nature of the early Jain school and elements derived from other schools. Most of the other contemporary yoga systems alluded in the Upanishads and some Pali canons are lost to time.|$|E
5|$|The {{descriptor}} hydrated or anhydrous is {{used when}} referring to iron(III) chloride, <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two common forms. The hexahydrate is usually given as the simplified empirical formula FeCl3⋅6H2O. It may also be given as trans-Cl⋅2H2O and the systematic name tetraaquadichloroiron(III) chloride dihydrate, which more clearly represents its structure.|$|E
50|$|A gap {{reduction}} {{is a type}} of reduction that, while useful in proving some inapproximability results, does not resemble the other reductions shown here. Gap reductions deal with optimization problems within a decision problem container, generated by changing <b>the</b> problem goal <b>to</b> <b>distinguishing</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> optimal solution and solutions some multiplicative factor worse than the optimum.|$|R

5|$|The {{residents}} of Plymouth used terms <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> earliest settlers {{of the colony}} and those that came later. The first generation of settlers, generally thought to be those that arrived before 1627, called themselves the Old Comers or Planters. Later generations of Plymouth residents referred to this group as the Forefathers.|$|E
5|$|In Vietnam, confiscated pygmy lorises {{are usually}} {{taken to the}} Endangered Primate Rescue Centre in Cúc Phương National Park, to be reintroduced into the wild. Non-experts may find it {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> pygmy slow loris and the Sunda slow loris, as both have similarly reddish fur, which is variable in colors. In international shipments, pygmy lorises may be even mixed up with pottos or lemurs.|$|E

Similarly, the referencing of motion to the space medium restores the physical meaning of clock time, length contraction, and momentum. Furthermore, by incorporating Williamson’s bound-radiation theory of atomic particles, the total conversion of mass to energy is given a clear physical interpretation. </p...|$|R
5|$|Pilophorus acicularis can be {{separated}} from similar species by its tall pseudopodetia. It may be confused with P.robustus, especially in material from Alaska where both species occur together. Usually, the different branching (umbellate in P.robustus versus dichotomous in P.acicularis) {{and the lack of}} a columella (an internal, column-shaped structure) in longitudinal sections of the pseudopodetia of P.acicularis make it relatively easy <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two.|$|E
5|$|The {{archaeological site}} and tourist {{attraction}} of Mixco Viejo {{was named after}} being erroneously associated with the Postclassic Poqomam capital referred to in colonial records by that name.

5|$|After {{his wife}} Sita is kidnapped by the demon-king Ravana, Rama {{and his brother}} Lakshmana wander the forest searching for her. Upon meeting the monkey-warrior Hanuman, they are taken to the exiled Sugriva. Rama forms an {{alliance}} with Sugriva, whom he will help; in order to defeat Vali and regain his wife Ruma and his kingship. In return Sugriva will aid {{in the search for}} Sita. As agreed, Sugriva challenges Vali in the wrestling contest, but Rama is unable <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two fighters and Sugriva loses the contest. Rama explains his predicament to Sugriva and tells him to re-challenge Vali, but this time, Rama garlands Sugriva to differentiate him from Vali.|$|E

5|$|In 1834, Charles Wheatstone {{developed}} {{a method of}} using a rapidly rotating mirror to study transient phenomena, and applied this method to measure the velocity of electricity in a wire and the duration of an electric spark. He communicated to François Arago the idea that his method could be adapted to {{a study of the}} speed of light. Arago expanded upon Wheatstone's concept in an 1838 publication, emphasizing the possibility that a test of the relative speed of light in air versus water could be used <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> particle and wave theories of light.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Suillus americanus has {{a similar}} appearance, but a more easterly distribution. It is {{associated}} with eastern white pine. Although some authors have tried <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two with by using width of the stem, or by differences in fruit body colouration, it is acknowledged that these characteristics are variable, and depend on environmental factors. The phylogenetic analysis of Wu and colleagues (2000) suggests that the two taxa may be the same, although more samples from different geographical areas {{will be needed to}} verify this.|$|E
5|$|Niccolò Massa {{discovered}} in 1536 that the ventricles {{were filled with}} fluid. Archiangelo Piccolomini of Rome was the first <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> cerebrum and cerebral cortex. In 1543 Andreas Vesalius published his seven-volume De humani corporis fabrica. The seventh book covered the brain and eye, with detailed images of the ventricles, cranial nerves, pituitary gland, meninges, structures of the eye, the vascular supply to the brain and spinal cord, and {{an image of the}} peripheral nerves. Vesalius rejected the common belief that the ventricles were responsible for brain function, arguing that many animals have a similar ventricular system to humans, but no true intelligence.|$|E

5|$|Pilot {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} {{belonging to the}} genus Globicephala. The two extant species are the long-finned pilot whale (G. melas) and the short-finned pilot whale (G. macrorhynchus). The two are not readily distinguishable at sea, {{and analysis of the}} skulls is the best way <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> species. Between the two species, they range nearly worldwide, with long-finned pilot whales living in colder waters and short-finned pilot whales living in tropical and subtropical waters. Pilot whales are among the largest of the oceanic dolphins, exceeded in size only by the killer whale. They and other large members of the dolphin family are also known as blackfish.|$|E
5|$|Seeds {{and fruit}} form the major {{component}} of the diets of pigeons and doves. In fact, the family {{can be divided into}} the seed-eating or granivorous species (subfamily Columbinae) and the fruit-and-mast-eating or frugivorous species (the other four subfamilies). The granivorous species typically feed on seed found on the ground, whereas the frugivorous species tend to feed in trees. There are morphological adaptations that can be used <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups: granivores tend to have thick walls in their gizzards, intestines, and esophagi whereas the frugivores tend to have thin walls. In addition, fruit-eating species have short intestines whereas those that eat seeds have longer ones. Frugivores are capable of clinging to branches and even hang upside down to reach fruit.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} {{profound}} differences with psychoanalytic ideas, the theoretical basis of Bowlby's monograph was controversial {{in a number}} of ways. Some profoundly disagreed with the necessity for maternal (or equivalent) love in order to function normally, or that the formation of an ongoing relationship with a child was an important part of parenting. The idea that early experiences have serious consequences for intellectual and psychosocial development was controversial in itself. Others questioned the extent to which his hypothesis was supported by the evidence. There was criticism of the confusion of the effects of privation (no primary attachment figure) and deprivation (loss of the primary attachment figure) and in particular, of the failure <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> effects of the lack of a primary attachment figure and the other forms of deprivation and understimulation that might affect children in institutions.|$|E

5|$|Examination of {{the radar}} array also allowed British {{scientists}} {{to conclude that}} they would have to deploy a countermeasure that had recently been developed, code-named Window. Examination of the Würzburg array showed that it was impervious to being jammed by conventional means used by the British during the early years of the conflict; thus Window would have to be deployed against German radars. The effectiveness of Window against Würzburg radar arrays was confirmed by a raid conducted by RAF Bomber Command on 24 July 1943 against Hamburg (Operation Gomorrah); when the bombers utilised Window, all of the radar arrays in Hamburg were blinded and their operators confused, unable <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> radar signature of a real bomber and several pieces of Window giving off a similar signature.|$|E
5|$|Excluding a few {{controversial}} claims, scientists {{agree that}} all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. The dinosaur fossil record {{has been interpreted}} to show both a decline in diversity and no decline in diversity {{during the last few}} million years of the Cretaceous, {{and it may be that}} the quality of the dinosaur fossil record is simply not good enough to permit researchers <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> options. There is no evidence that late Maastrichtian non-avian dinosaurs could burrow, swim, or dive, which suggests they were unable to shelter themselves from the worst parts of any environmental stress that occurred at the K–Pg boundary. It is possible that small dinosaurs (other than birds) did survive, but they would have been deprived of food, as herbivorous dinosaurs would have found plant material scarce and carnivores would have quickly found prey in short supply.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, imaging of {{the system}} with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys {{revealed}} {{the presence of a}} secondary dust disk inclined at an angle of about 5° to the main disk and extending at least 130 AU from the star. The secondary disk is asymmetrical: the southwest extension is more curved and less inclined than the northeast. The imaging was not good enough <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> main and secondary disks within 80 AU of Beta Pictoris, however the northeast extension of the dust disk is predicted to intersect with the main disk at about 30 AU from the star. The secondary disk may be produced by a massive planet in an inclined orbit removing matter from the primary disk and causing it to move in an orbit aligned with the planet.|$|E
