5|$|Brian Bloom (Anton Yelchin), a {{struggling}} 24-year-old writer in New York City, meets a 33-year-old French woman named Arielle Pierpoint (Bérénice Marlohe). They feel powerfully attracted to one another. After their second meeting, Arielle reveals {{that she is}} married to a diplomat, Valéry (Lambert Wilson), and they have two young children. Arielle and Valéry have an agreement that each is permitted to have extramarital affairs {{as long as they are}} limited to the time between 5 and 7 p.m. on weeknights. Brian is perplexed at <b>this</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> tells Arielle that he cannot continue the relationship with her, believing it is an unethical affair. Arielle says that, should he change his mind, she will continue to smoke on Fridays at the same place they met.|$|E
5|$|She {{enrolled}} at Cornell University, {{and earned a}} master's degree in 1951. During her graduate studies, she studied the motions of 109 galaxies and made {{one of the first}} observations of deviations from Hubble flow (how the galaxies move apart from one another). She worked with astronomer Martha Carpenter on galactic dynamics, and studied under Philip Morrison, Hans Bethe, and Richard Feynman. Though the conclusion she came to - that there was an orbital motion of galaxies around a particular pole - was disproven, the idea that galaxies were moving held true and sparked further research. Her research also provided early evidence of the supergalactic plane. <b>This</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> the data she discovered was immensely controversial, and after fighting to be allowed to present her work at the American Astronomical Society despite being pregnant, she was summarily rejected and the paper forgotten.|$|E

5|$|The knights and {{the entire}} town mourn over Niren's death. Flynn realizes that the blastia used in the {{fortress}} where the aer abnormality originated, along with the piece he spotted on the floor, were a specialized type used only by Garista. Yuri and Flynn confront Garista with <b>this</b> <b>information,</b> <b>and</b> Garista reveals that he was attempting to illegally create {{a new kind of}} blastia, but failed and decided to leave the blastia to destroy itself, therefore destroying Shizontonia and killing any and all witnesses. Yuri and Flynn attempt to arrest Garista, but a fight ensues and Yuri kills him. In the aftermath, Shizontonia is evacuated due to the failure of the barrier blastia. Yuri leaves the knights, taking Niren's blastia as a keepsake and bringing Repede along with him, saying his goodbyes to everyone in the town. Flynn sees him off at the gates, and the two share a fond farewell, swearing to meet again one day.|$|E

Although Lee and Michael repeatedly voiced concerns early in the task about the need to think about profit margins, both Ian and Kevin paid little heed to this. Michael was later heavily criticised for deciding on the prices without any knowledge of the team's costs, but defended himself against this by pointing out that Ian had consistently refused to give him <b>this</b> <b>information,</b> <b>and</b> that the team would have otherwise missed the deadline for printing their menus.|$|E

After the FBI raised concerns about non-governmental parties in the NTSB's investigation having access to <b>this</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> possible prosecutorial difficulties resulting from multiple interviews of the same witness, the NTSB deferred and did not interview witnesses to the crash. A Safety Board investigator later reviewed FBI interview notes and briefed other Board investigators on their contents. In November 1996, the FBI agreed to allow the NTSB access to summaries of witness accounts in which personally identifying information had been redacted and to conduct {{a limited number of}} witness interviews. In April 1998, the FBI provided the NTSB with the identities of the witnesses but due to the time elapsed a decision was made to rely on the original FBI documents rather than reinterview witnesses.|$|E
25|$|According to the Rongcheng Shi bamboo slips {{from the}} Warring States period, the Yu Gong from the Han dynasty {{and various other}} sources, Yu the Great divided the world into the Nine Provinces in prehistoric times, one of them Xu. The Yuanhe Xingzuan, a Tang dynasty {{compilation}} {{of information on the}} origins of Chinese surnames, as well as the Tongzhi, a Southern Song dynasty historical book, also state that Yu enfeoffed Ruomu, grandson of the mythological emperor Zhuanxu, as lord of Xu around 2100 BC. In turn the Xu peoples were supposed to be Ruomu's descendants. Furthermore, it was claimed this Xu state or province had originally occupied the entire area between the Huai and Yellow River. No contemporary evidence exists to verify <b>this</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> the oldest literary sources available, the oracle bones of the Shang dynasty, do not mention such an empire. As result, the stories of Xu's foundation remain legendary.|$|E
25|$|Admission {{for senior}} high schools, {{especially}} selective high schools, is somewhat {{similar to the}} one for universities in China. Students will go through an application system where they may choose the high schools at which they wish to study in an order to their preference before the high schools set out their entrance requirements. Once this is completed and the high schools will announce their requirements based on <b>this</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> the places they will offer in that year. For instance, if the school offers 800 places in that year, the results offered by the 800th intake student will be the standard requirements. So effectively, this ensures the school selects the top candidates in all the students who have applied to said school in that academic year. However, the severe competition only occurs in the very top high schools, normally, most students will have sufficient results for them to continue their secondary education if they wish to.|$|E

25|$|Every living {{organism}} (with {{the possible exception}} of RNA viruses) contains molecules of DNA, which carries genetic information. Genes are the pieces of DNA that carry <b>this</b> <b>information,</b> <b>and</b> they influence the properties of an organism. Genes determine an individual's general appearance and to some extent their behavior. If two organisms are closely related, their DNA will be very similar. On the other hand, the more distantly related two organisms are, the more differences they will have. For example, brothers are closely related and have very similar DNA, while cousins share a more distant relationship and have far more differences in their DNA. Similarities in DNA are used to determine the relationships between species in much the same manner as they are used to show relationships between individuals. For example, comparing chimpanzees with gorillas and humans shows that there is as much as a 96percent similarity between the DNA of humans and chimps. Comparisons of DNA indicate that humans and chimpanzees are more closely related to each other than either species is to gorillas.|$|E
25|$|The {{cognitive}} mechanism {{involved in the}} Stroop task {{is referred to as}} directed attention. The Stroop task requires the participant to engage in and allows assessment of processes such as attention management, speed and accuracy of reading words and colours and of inhibition of competing stimuli. The stimulus is a colour word that is printed in a different colour than what the written word reads. For example, the word “red” is written in a blue font. One must verbally classify the colour that the word is displayed/printed in, while ignoring the information provided by the written word. In the aforementioned example, this would require the participant to say “blue” when presented with the stimulus. Although the majority of people will show some slowing when given incompatible text versus font colour, this is more severe in individuals with deficits in inhibition. The Stroop task takes advantage of the fact that most humans are so proficient at reading colour words that it is extremely difficult to ignore <b>this</b> <b>information,</b> <b>and</b> instead acknowledge, recognize and say the colour the word is printed in. The Stroop task is an assessment of attentional vitality and flexibility. More modern variations of the Stroop task tend to be more difficult and often try to limit the sensitivity of the test.|$|E

500|$|According to the work's dedication, Orm {{wrote it}} {{at the behest of}} Brother Walter, who was his brother both [...] (biologically) and as a fellow canon of an Augustinian order (Matthew 2004, p.936). With <b>this</b> <b>information,</b> <b>and</b> the {{evidence}} of the dialect of the text, it is possible to propose a place of origin with reasonable certainty. While some scholars, among them Henry Bradley, have regarded the likely origin as Elsham Priory in north Lincolnshire (Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.174–75), as of the mid-1990s it became widely accepted that Orm wrote in the Bourne Abbey in Bourne, Lincolnshire (Treharne 2000, p.273). Two additional pieces of evidence support this conjecture: firstly, Arrouaisian canons established the abbey in 1138, and secondly, the work includes dedicatory prayers to Peter and Paul, the patrons of Bourne Abbey (Parkes 1983, pp.115–27). The Arrouaisian rule was largely that of Augustine, so that its houses often are loosely referred to as Augustinian (Jack, George, in Matthew and Harrison 2004, pp.936–37; Parkes 1983, pp.115–27).|$|E
