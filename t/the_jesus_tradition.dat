40|$|This {{dissertation}} compares <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>traditions</b> in Paul s genuine {{letters to}} <b>the</b> synoptic <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition.</b> <b>The</b> {{aim is to}} identify parallels between <b>Jesus</b> <b>traditions</b> in <b>the</b> Pauline letters and synoptic gospels and {{to determine whether the}} wording of <b>the</b> Pauline <b>Jesus</b> <b>traditions</b> is closer to any particular synoptic gospel or Q. The first main part of the dissertation aims to establish whether <b>Jesus</b> <b>traditions</b> in Paul s letters can be presupposed, as it often has been argued that Paul did not have much knowledge about Jesus or that he was disinterested in the life and teachings of <b>the</b> historical <b>Jesus.</b> In these discussions, the biography of the apostle Paul is examined. Based on the places Paul had visited after his conversion, his encounters with people close to Jesus and his initial preaching when founding new congregations, it has to be assumed that Paul was well informed about <b>Jesus.</b> <b>The</b> explicit references to sayings of Jesus in Paul s letters (1 Cor 7 : 10 11; 9 : 14; 11 : 23 25) confirm that Paul knew and used <b>Jesus</b> <b>traditions</b> {{similar to those of the}} synoptic gospels. In the second main part of the dissertation possible allusions (instances in which Paul uses <b>Jesus</b> <b>traditions</b> without explicitly indicating it) to <b>Jesus</b> <b>traditions</b> in Paul s letters are investigated and compared to similar synoptic sayings of Jesus. Allusions to <b>Jesus</b> <b>traditions</b> in 1 Thessalonians and Romans are revisited. Special attention is paid to possible allusions in Galatians. Galatians 1 : 16 is compared to Matt 16 : 16 17 and Paul s rendition of the command to love the neighbour in Gal 5 : 14 (cf. Rom 13 : 8 10) is compared to the love commandment in the synoptic gospels. The study shows that all of Paul s quotes and allusions to <b>Jesus</b> <b>traditions</b> have parallels in Matthew, although the wording of <b>the</b> Pauline <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> occasionally agrees more with Luke s gospel than Matthew s. Mark never shares more verbal agreement with a Pauline sayings of Jesus than Matthew and Luke. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. tm 2016 New Testament StudiesPhDUnrestricte...|$|R

50|$|A modern {{consensus}} {{exists that}} Jesus {{must be understood}} as a Jew in a Jewish environment. According to scholar Bart D. Ehrman, Jesus was so very firmly rooted in his own time and place as a first-century Palestinian Jew - with his ancient Jewish comprehension of the world, and God - that he does not translate easily into a modern idiom. Ehrman stresses that Jesus was raised in a Jewish household in the Jewish hamlet of Nazareth. He was brought up in a Jewish culture, accepted Jewish ways and eventually became a Jewish teacher, who, like other Jewish teachers of his time, debated the Law of Moses orally. Early Christians sustained these teachings of Jesus orally. Rabbis or teachers in every generation were raised and trained to deliver this oral tradition accurately. It consisted of two parts: <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> (i.e., logia or sayings of Jesus) and inspired opinion. The distinction is one of authority: where the earthly Jesus has spoken on a subject, that word is to be regarded as an instruction or command.|$|E

40|$|Texts, co-texts, and con-texts of {{the empty}} tomb in <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> An {{investigation}} of texts, co-texts and con-texts {{of the empty}} tomb in <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> provides a “situation-specific common background knowledge” (Auer, 1996 : 18 - 19) from which perspective this article is written. The article aims {{to argue that the}} myth behind the empty tomb in <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> deploys a trajectory of five links. Its origin, the first of the five links, {{is to be found in}} the metaphorical use of the motif of recreation analogous to the foundational narrative in Israel’s historical memoirs of God’s “creatio ex nihilo”. The foundational narrative consists of a collective anthropological facet and an indivdual psychological facet. The anthropological facet is manifested in the memoir of the suppression of Israel as a downtrodden nation. The individual facet pertains to the martyred heroes in Israel’s history. In this article the five links of the trajectory are conceptualised in five chronological phases represented by specific textual evidence. They are, firstly, the descent of a corpse into the sheol; secondly, the objectifying of metaphorical language about the resurrection of the dead, which refers to either Israel as a “corporate personality” or individuals; thirdly, the Hellenisation of the resurrection belief pattern which existed in the Semitic, Eastern-Mediterranean world, in the light of the theology of apotheosis/divinisation and ideas about immortality and reincarnation; and fourthly, the empowerment of suffering righteous mortals when participating in the renewed life of resurrected/ascended divine heroes. The fifth phase pertains to the period when the other four phases reached an apogee and resurrection belief served as a kind of coping-healing. The article aims to argue that the hermeneutical significance of the empty tomb in <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> is to be found in the third phase. The modes in terms of which Jesus’ empty tomb were interpreted by the first “Christ-followers” are to be found in phases four and five. </p...|$|E

40|$|Until recently, and for {{a variety}} of reasons, most {{historical}} Jesus scholarship has typically seen Jesus as essentially non-political. Recently, this has begun to change, to a large extent because of the fuller description of the social world of Jesus made possible by the use of interdisciplinary models and insights. Seen {{within the context of a}} social world described as a peasant, patriarchal and purity society, many of <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>traditions</b> reflect both a sharp critique of society and advocacy of an alternative social vision.

Sexuality and <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>Tradition</b> is thorough in its investigation and compelling in its analyses. Loader examines all of the passages that convey views about sexuality in the Gospels and other first-century literature, including the Gospel of Thomas, and the influence in Paul of <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition.</b> Among the interesting topics covered are attitudes concerning lust, perspectives on marriage and divorce, and views about celibacy. Loader shows how, despite the passing of two thousand years and massive social change, these ancient texts contain common issues that we still grapple with today...|$|E
40|$|The {{literary}} mindset (‘default setting’) {{of modern}} Western culture prevents those trained in that culture from recognizing that oral cultures operate differently. The classic {{solution to the}} Synoptic problem, and the chief alternatives, have envisaged {{the relationships between the}} Gospel traditions in almost exclusively literary terms. But the earliest phase of transmission of <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> was without doubt predominantly by word of mouth. And recent studies of oral cultures provide several characteristic features of oral tradition. Much of the Synoptic tradition, even in its present form, reflects in particular the combination of stability and flexibility so characteristic of the performances of oral tradition. Re-envisaging the early transmission of <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> therefore requires us to recognize that the literary paradigm (including a clearly delineated Q document) is too restrictive in the range of possible explanations it offers for the diverse/divergent character of Synoptic parallels.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{attempts to}} answer the questions, “What is the most appropriate background for understanding Paul’s views on marriage, celibacy and divorce as found in 1 Corinthians 7 ?” and “How do we account for the unique features in 1 Corinthians that are not clearly delineated in <b>the</b> Greco-Roman works, <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> or in other NT writings?” This work argues that Paul derives the substance of his perspective on marriage, celibacy and divorce directly from the Jewish Scriptures (LXX) and <b>the</b> uniquely motivated <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> {{to which he was}} exposed. Paul’s reception of this <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> can be traced to first generation believers as well as to his own revelatory religious experience. Such a proposal does not preclude Paul from being significantly influenced by his social context, but suggests that he was acutely aware of the philosophical differences between himself and other thinkers of his day. This work follows the contention that Hellenism only affected the ‘outer shell’ of Paul’s brand of Pharisaism (Hengel). What is more, the Apostle openly uses this <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> when <b>the</b> situations of his missionary churches paralleled those confronted by Jesus and seems to have expanded upon it when he had no explicit tradition from which to draw as new situations arose within his communities.

40|$|Unknown {{to many in}} “Christian” North American society, <b>the</b> {{person of}} <b>Jesus</b> is highly revered among the {{millions}} of Muslims in the world. This shared reverence for Jesus between Muslims and Christians allows for possible dialogue and greater understanding between adherents of the two religions. Moreover, the renewed interest in scholarship on Jesus, whether historical or theological, allows <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>traditions</b> of Islam to become additional sources in this ﬁeld of scholarship. Given these two reasons, the academic scholar of religion, then, has a motivation to dive into the growing wealth of discussions on <b>the</b> Islamic <b>Jesus</b> in <b>the</b> West. This thesis examines three different areas of Western scholarship on <b>the</b> Islamic <b>Jesus.</b> This is done in effort to discover what affirmations are made about <b>the</b> Islamic <b>Jesus</b> in Western scholarship, and to determine what differences and similarities can be discovered between these three areas.

40|$|This article aims at {{conversing with}} {{aspects of the}} {{contribution}} Pieter Craffert (New Testament scholar from the University of South Africa) has made in his book on the historical Jesus, The life of a Galilean shaman : Jesus of Nazareth in anthropological-historical perspective (2008). In the book traits of the "shamanic complex" are heuristically used to explain the layering of traditions as reconfigurations of each other within the same cultural area and to argue for continuity from the cultural constitution of a social personage to the communication and enscripturation of that social personage within the same cultural system. Jesus' healings and his encountering of spirits are {{understood in terms of}} the notion of alternate states of consciousness as polyphased consciousness. The book's point of departure is the conviction that an anthropological-sensitive reading scenario represents an epistemological alternative to that of scholars who emphasize the historical-critical analysis of strata in the development of <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition.</b> The article consists of an appraisal and a critique. It argues for a different judgment rather than posing a thesis of a paradigm shift. The approach of some scholars who consider the investigation into the stratification of overlays in <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> as central to historical Jesus studies is evaluated as complementary to a cultural-sensitive reading scenario...|$|E

40|$|The article {{examines}} {{ways in which}} the views of biblical scholars as to the transmission of early Christian <b>traditions,</b> especially <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>traditions,</b> have been revolutionized by so-called orality/literacy stud-ies since Werner Kelber’s seminal The Oral and the Written Gospel (1983). In the 2000 s, an important turn in the study of orality and literacy in early Christianity took place with the discovery of memory. This has given rise to a focus on theories of collective memory and more recently on the cognitive aspects of individual memory, producing fresh new insights into the close intertwining of orality and literacy in ancient literary activity. The last part of the article brings up the role of ritual in the transmission of early Christian traditions, an aspect that has received less attention in the discussion. For purposes of further analysis, three perspectives on the role of ritual in the study of orality and textuality in early Christianity are highlighted and elaborated. The first underscores the need for a fresh analysis of the numerous liturgical passages in the New Testament identified by the generation of form critics. The second focuses on oral-aural (‘liturgical’) aspects of early Christian literature as part of the larger phenomenon of Greco-Roman literary culture, in which literacy was defined by public performance and recitation to a degree that differs substantially from the modern use of printed books. The last perspective highlights the important question of ritual’s capacity to function as an instrument of religious teaching and doctrinal consolidation...|$|R
40|$|Today, moderns, {{as well as}} biblical scholars, have a {{hard time}} {{accepting}} the possibility that the Gospels are authentic. The idea that a document composed two thousand years ago could be trusted is dismissed as absurd. However, this assumes that there is no evidence suggesting the contrary. Richard Bauckham, in his book, Jesus and the Eyewitnesses, rejects this “gratuitous doubt” and provides a novel contribution to our knowledge of the historical Jesus. This book has awakened scholars to the possibility that the skepticism of form criticism is not only uncritical but also unwarranted. Contra to popular opinion in the field of New Testament scholarship, Bauckham argues that before the Gospels were written, <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> was intimately connected to specific eyewitnesses and teachers who functioned as guarantors of the Word. More specifically, he rejects the form critics’ claim that the Gospels were subject to the creative collective of early Church communities and presents compelling evidence illustrating that these traditions were actually transmitted in a formally controlled manner. While opponents of Bauckham’s thesis claim that his work tries to prove too much, I think the author fails to go far enough in his analysis of the data collected. In this essay, I will present a summary of Bauckham’s strongest arguments for the authenticity of the Gospels and evaluate the counter arguments presented by his critics. Furthermore, in an attempt to strengthen the author’s thesis, I will argue that the Gospel of Mark actually reflects {{the way in which the}} human brain encodes memories with high fidelity, thereby demonstrating the faithful transmittance employed in the communication of <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition...</b>|$|E

40|$|Interpreting {{a parable}} {{requires}} the decoding {{of the nature}} of an analogy which will reveal the degree of the deciphering of the riddle communicated through parabolic discourse. In biblical hermeneutics throughout the 20 th century Aristotelian logic revived in parable research in that the nature of a ‘meta-phor’ between the subject and the predicate in a comparison (the so-called Ähnlichkeitsrelation) was understood in terms of either ‘epi-phor’ (analogy) or ‘dia-phor’ (disanalogy).
