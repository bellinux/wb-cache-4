He proposes to the Minister that any future local authority projects must list their criteria for failure before they are given the go-ahead. Hacker is immediately interested and instructs Bernard, his Principal Private Secretary, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>paper</b> his top priority reading for the weekend. They are joined by Sir Humphrey, who is apprised of Hacker's new plan and is completely startled, labelling it [...] "dangerous nonsense". Hacker impresses upon his Permanent Secretary the urgent need to bring forward proposals. Sir Humphrey falls back on Sir Arnold's advice and tells his minister that civil defence is the one area of local government which would be a [...] "vote winner". These words have the desired effect and Hacker is curious. Sir Humphrey convinces him that there is a real public interest and mentions in passing that Ludovic Kennedy {{is in the process of}} preparing a documentary on the subject. In the meantime, the London borough of Thames Marsh spends less on civil defence than any other authority: he suggests a ministerial visit. Bernard points out that the particular borough is run by Ben Stanley — a firebrand who is subject to frequent censure by the press. Hacker asks Bernard to ensure that there be plenty of journalists in attendance for his trip.|$|E
