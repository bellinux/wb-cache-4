The crises is described as the deflation of the asset bubble once confidence was undermined in key underlying factors: American house prices and the credit worthiness of sub-prime mortgages. [...] Following on from this was the liquidity crunch {{in the world of}} finance, with the knock-on effect on the real economy. [...] Lord Skidelsky divides his discussion of the response into two sections, covering the bail-outs and the stimulus packages. He identifies the follow possible causes: financial innovation; lack of regulation; the behaviour of the bankers & hedge funds and the failings of both credit-rating agencies and governments. He finishes by asserting that all these actors are influenced by economic theories, and that it is recent trends in economics that are the real cause of the crises.|$|E

5000|$|Flann himself died on 25 November 1056, {{the date}} {{supplied}} by the Annals of Tigernach. The Annals of Ulster call him [...] "eminent lector and master of the historical lore of Ireland". A quatrain on Flann appears in an anonymous poem on the episcopal court of Áed úa Forréid (bishop of Armagh, 1032-1056), composed between 1032 and 1042; it provides a brief but probably near-contemporary <b>thumbnail</b> <b>sketch</b> of the man.|$|E

50|$|Comic Art (Grades 4 to 12): Graphic {{novels and}} comics, and the mythology behind them, are heavily {{ingrained}} in pop culture.

5000|$|Art directors, {{storyboard}} {{artists and}} graphic designers, {{as well as}} other kinds of visual artists, use the term [...] "thumbnail sketch" [...] to describe a small drawing on paper (usually part of a group) used to explore multiple ideas quickly. <b>Thumbnail</b> <b>sketches</b> are similar to doodles, but may include as much detail as a small sketch.|$|R

[...] "I tell {{students}} to do something every day - even if it’s a quick <b>thumbnail</b> <b>sketch...</b> Rather like a dancer has to practise every day, a painter has to oil the hinges by doing little drawings." [...] He preferred to paint from notes and drawings in his sketchbooks, rather than from photographs. As a result his favorite subjects were local to his studio, for example Porthgain Harbour.|$|E

He highlighted it for [...] "offering a odd <b>thumbnail</b> <b>sketch</b> of the reigning crown prince of fashion," [...] but predicted Scott's fan to be [...] "frustrated by the film because the brush strokes are broad, and the focus feels more about the scrum and swirl around the man than the man himself".|$|E

50|$|In a {{variation}} of the plot script, attributed to Harvey Kurtzman, the writer breaks down the story into page roughs or <b>thumbnail</b> <b>sketches,</b> with captions and dialogue jotted down inside the roughs. The artist (who is often the comic's writer as well) then fleshes out the roughs onto full-size art board. Writer/artists Frank Miller and Jeff Smith favor this style, as did Archie Goodwin.|$|R

He stated his intention of choosing highly oriented plan. One reason was creating this feeling of [...] "away from Paris"; the other reason is the consideration of privacy. Two houses were built adjacent to this house. Privacy became a big consideration in his design. This is also part of his letter to this land owner.|$|E
5000|$|Speaking {{about his}} work as a comic book penciler, Ryan {{described}} his process: [...] "I read the stories and 'see' what it should look like in my mind, do a <b>thumbnail</b> <b>sketch</b> of the picture in my head and then go to full size drawing paper." [...] Although known primarily for his pencil art for comic books, Ryan said that he preferred to ink his own pencils: [...] "I have worked with some amazing inkers. Some inkers made my work look better than it was. Some other inkers... not so much. When I ink my pencils, the readers get to see what I can do." ...|$|E
50|$|Chișinevschi {{came back}} to Romania with {{instructions}} from Moscow, helping to reorganize the Agitprop Department, the PCR’s propaganda nucleus. During the party's years of underground activity, he helped orient it toward Bolshevism (specifically Stalinism). He shunned real intellectual problems and the debates of the Marxist left, instead idolizing Joseph Stalin. He was most influenced by the latter’s The Problems of Leninism, a sort of <b>thumbnail</b> <b>sketch</b> of revolutionary theory; once he had read the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course, with its blatant falsifications, he looked no further than Stalin for ideological guidance. A devoted Comintern man, he was unconcerned with Romania’s cultural and political history and context.|$|E
5000|$|Artist Marcio Takara {{begins his}} pages with 7" [...] x 5" [...] ink <b>thumbnail</b> <b>sketches</b> {{with which he}} shows his overall ideas to his editor. When he begins the actual pencils, he keeps them [...] "loose", because he will {{eventually}} ink over them himself, and does not require greater specificity. The penciling stage is the fastest stage for Takara, who does all of his pencil work with an HB 0.5 mechanical pencil, completing two or three penciled pages a day, sometimes even inking all three {{by the end of}} the day.|$|R

50|$|The {{character}} of Nancy Drew was conceived by Stratemeyer, who provided Benson with index card <b>thumbnail</b> <b>sketches.</b> However, {{she was the}} one who created Nancy's spunky, plucky personality, and her daring, adventurous spirit. Benson took the plots supplied by the Syndicate and created a character that is still loved today. Her texts were edited and rewritten as required, and the Syndicate published the books using the pseudonym, Carolyn Keene. Subsequent Nancy Drew stories (with some exceptions) that Benson wrote for, were all re-written by Edna Stratemeyer Squier and, primarily, Harriet Stratemeyer Adams, after their father's death in 1930.|$|R
5000|$|Pausanias gives a <b>thumbnail</b> <b>sketch</b> of the resettlement. Miletus was {{the first}} city attacked, where {{there had been some}} Mycenaean Greeks {{apparently}} under the rule of Cretans. After overthrowing the Cretan government and settling there the Ionians widened their attack to Ephesus, Samos and Priene. Combining with Aeolians from Thebes they founded Myus. Colophon was already in the hands of Aeolians who had arrived via Crete in Mycenaean times. The Ionians [...] "swore a treaty of union" [...] with them. They took Lebedos driving out the Carians and augmented the Aeolian population of Teos. They settled on Chios, took Erythrae from the Carians, Pamphylians (both Luwian) and Cretans. Clazomenae and Phocaea were settled from Colophon. Somewhat later they took Smyrna from the Aeolians.|$|E
50|$|In 1968, Carmine Infantino, newly {{installed}} {{editorial director}} of DC Comics, and his editor, Joe Orlando, {{came up with the}} name and basic premise of the loner whose family had been wiped out by murderous thugs, and then brought in Sheldon Mayer (former DC editor and creator of Sugar and Spike) and Sergio Aragonés to further flesh out the concept. Shelly Mayer would write the first appearance (Showcase #76). Infantino claimed to have greatly rewritten it. The assignment was then handed to Aragonés, with Denny O'Neil doing the dialog over Aragonés' plots, and Nick Cardy providing the art. Issues were produced in a variation of the full script method. First, Aragonés would create a plot in <b>thumbnail</b> <b>sketch</b> form, then O'Neil would write the dialog, and last came Cardy's finished art.|$|E
50|$|This rather {{technical}} {{article provides}} a typological {{sketch of the}} Miskito language. Another related article outlines Miskito grammar in fuller detail.

60|$|And if York and London {{will not}} satisfy, let the reader take Edinburgh, whose Charity Organization Society has {{produced}} an admirable but infinitely distressing {{report of the}} physical conditions of the school children there.
