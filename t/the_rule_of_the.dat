Sultan Saif Nawaz Jung Bahadur, an Arab chief from Mukalla, Hadhramaut, Yemen, who was among the seventh Nizam's court nobility, popularised it in Hyderabad. Addition of local flavours to the original recipe resulted in a taste distinct from other types of haleem.|$|E

5|$|After the Sangam age, most {{of present-day}} Tamil Nadu, {{including}} Madurai, came under <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kalabhra dynasty, which was ousted by the Pandyas around 590 CE. The Pandyas were outsted from Madurai by the Chola dynasty {{during the early}} 9th century. The city remained {{under the control of}} the Cholas until the early 13th century, when the second Pandyan empire was established with Madurai as its capital. After the death of Kulasekara Pandian (1268–1308 CE), Madurai came under <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Delhi Sultanate. The Madurai Sultanate then seceded from Delhi and functioned as an independent kingdom until its gradual annexation by the Vijayanagar Empire in 1378 CE. Madurai became independent from Vijayanagar in 1559 CE under the Nayaks. Nayak rule ended in 1736 CE and Madurai was repeatedly captured several times by Chanda Sahib (1740– 1754 CE), Arcot Nawab and Muhammed Yusuf Khan (1725– 1764 CE) in the middle of 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Conflict {{among the}} Christian {{population}} of Neapolis emerged in 451.

5|$|Democracy, or <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many over themselves. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> masses is positive, {{in that it}} is {{less likely}} to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature of democracy is the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E

5|$|Inscriptions {{from the}} eighth to the 14th centuries (during <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pandyas, Cholas and later Tenkasi Pandyas) {{indicate}} {{the growth of}} Tirunelveli as a centre of economic growth which developed around the Nellaiappar temple. The drier parts of the province also flourished during <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vijayanagara kings. From 1550 until the early modern era, migration to the city {{from other parts of}} the state was common and the urban regions became hubs of manufacturing and commerce. Tirunelveli was a strategic point, connecting the eastern and western parts of the peninsula, as well as a trading centre. Records of sea and overland trade between 1700 and 1850 indicate close trading connections with Sri Lanka and Kerala. During the 1840s, cotton produced in the region was in demand for British mills. The chief exports during British rule were cotton, jaggery, chillies, tobacco, palmyra fibre, salt, dried saltwater fish and cattle.|$|E

Under <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lords Baltimore, thousands of British Catholics emigrated to Maryland, establishing some of the oldest Catholic communities in what later became the United States. Catholic rule in Maryland was eventually nullified by the re-assertion of royal control over the colony.|$|E

5|$|After his {{conquest of}} Bulgaria, Basil II {{prevented}} revolts and discontent by retaining <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local nobility and by relieving the newly conquered {{lands of the}} obligation to pay taxes in gold, allowing them to be paid in kind instead. He also allowed the Bulgarian Patriarchate to retain its autocephalous status and all its dioceses, but reduced it to an archbishopric. After his death Byzantine domestic policies changed {{and a series of}} unsuccessful rebellions broke out, the largest being led by Peter Delyan. In 1185 Asen dynasty nobles Ivan Asen I and Peter IV organised a major uprising which resulted in the re-establishment of the Bulgarian state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire with Tarnovo as the capital.|$|E

5|$|Another notable {{king of the}} Anuradhapura Kingdom is Valagamba (103, 89–77 BC), {{also known}} as Vatthagamani Abhaya, who was overthrown by five invaders from South India. He regained his throne after {{defeating}} these invaders {{one by one and}} unified the country again under his rule. Saddha Tissa (137–119 BC), Mahaculi Mahatissa (77–63 BC), Vasabha (67–111), Gajabahu I (114–136), Dhatusena (455–473), Aggabodhi I (571–604) and Aggabodhi II (604–614) were among the rulers who held sway over the entire country after Dutthagamani and Valagamba. Rulers from Kutakanna Tissa (44–22 BC) to Amandagamani (29–19 BC) also managed to keep the whole country under <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Anuradhapura Kingdom. Other rulers could not maintain their rule over the whole island, and independent regions often existed in Ruhuna and Malayarata (hill country) for limited periods. During the final years of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, rebellions sprang up and the authority of the kings gradually declined. By the time of Mahinda V (982–1017), the last king of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king had become so weak that he could not even properly organize the collection of taxes.|$|E

Directed by Roger Christian and starring John Travolta, Barry Pepper and Forest Whitaker, the film depicts an Earth that has been under <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alien Psychlos for 1,000 years and {{tells the story of the}} rebellion that develops when the Psychlos attempt to use the surviving humans as gold miners.|$|E
5|$|British rule {{came at a}} {{price for}} many {{ordinary}} {{people as well as}} traders. The Shetlanders' nautical skills were sought by the Royal Navy: some 3,000 served during the Napoleonic Wars from 1800 to 1815 and press gangs were rife. During this period 120 men were taken from Fetlar alone and only 20 of them returned home. By the late 19th century 90% of all Shetland was owned by just 32 people, and between 1861 and 1881 more than 8,000 Shetlanders emigrated. With the passing of the Crofters' Act in 1886 the Liberal prime minister William Gladstone emancipated crofters from <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landlords. The Act enabled those who had effectively been landowners' serfs to become owner-occupiers of their own small farms.|$|E
