5|$|Blackbuck are {{severely}} affected by natural calamities such as floods and droughts, from which <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> {{as long as}} five years to recover. Wolves are major predators; a study found that old rutting bulls might be vulnerable to wolves. Cheetahs and pariah dogs are the other predators. Juveniles are also hunted by jackals. Village dogs are reported to kill fawns, but are unlikely to successfully hunt and kill adults.|$|E
5|$|Heterodimeric {{antibodies}} have {{a greater}} range in shapes <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> and the drugs that {{are attached to the}} arms don’t have to be the same on each arm, allowing for different combinations of drugs to be used in cancer treatment. Pharmaceuticals are able to produce highly functional bispecific, and even multispecific, antibodies. The degree to which they can function is impressive given that such a change shape from the natural form should lead to decreased functionality.|$|E
5|$|Non-{{professional}} phagocytes {{are more}} limited than professional phagocytes {{in the type}} of particles <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> up. This is due to their lack of efficient phagocytic receptors, in particular opsonins—which are antibodies and complement attached to invaders by the immune system. Additionally, most nonprofessional phagocytes do not produce reactive oxygen-containing molecules in response to phagocytosis.|$|E

5|$|Students are {{admitted}} to a single program {{and are expected to}} take all the classes required to complete that program in the number of semesters prescribed, although <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> 50% longer before facing administrative measures. While each program is usually managed by a single school or institute (exceptions apply, such as Computer Engineering, co-managed by the Institute of Computing and the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering), classes are usually ministered across different institutes or schools.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the species}} {{and where it}} lives, the larva either conceals itself under leaves, debris or pieces of wood, hides in a crack or digs a funnel-shaped pit in loose material. As ambush predators, {{catching}} prey is risky because food arrives unpredictably and, for those species that make traps, maintaining one is costly; the larvae therefore have low metabolic rates and can survive for long periods without food. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> several years to complete their life-cycle; they mature faster with plentiful food, but can survive for many months without feeding. In cooler climates they dig their way deeper and remain inactive during the winter.|$|E
5|$|If a cat so chooses, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> a {{different}} calling in life {{as that of}} a medicine cat. Medicine cats, unlike warriors, serve for their clan not through bloodshed, but through peace. They are trained to heal their Clanmates by using the natural resources as medicines; for example, cobwebs can be used to stitch deep wounds, whilst poppy seeds are used to lull a distressed cat into sleep. They sleep separately, surrounded by the herbs and resources they need to keep their Clan safe and healthy. Medicine cat apprentices go through a longer period of training than warriors, due to the vast amount of knowledge they must remember. Medicine cats are also not allowed to take any mates or have any kits. This is because they must care for each member of their Clan equally; if they were to form a loving relationship with any one individual, they may unfairly place that cat’s life over that of the Clan. A Clan tends to have only one or two, and occasionally three, medicine cats at any given time.|$|E

5|$|He {{makes it}} to her in time and administers the {{antidote}} before the infection can take hold. Bennett then contacts him and Hansen makes him promise that if he gives Bennett the research, Bennett will save Anna. He soon discovers that Kamsky infected himself with a strain of exocel DNA, and now wishes {{to do the same}} to Anna. Hansen finds Kamsky's laptop and transmits the antidote data to Bennett, but nothing else. As a furious Bennett berates Hansen, he and Anna agree to blow up the rig using C4. As Hansen plants the charges, he learns Kamsky had gone completely insane; after infecting himself with exocel serum, he released the imprisoned exos on the rig and planted a group of exocels on the Eastern Spirit. He then went into hiding to await his metamorphosis. When Hansen has planted all of the charges, he heads to the heliport to meet Anna. Before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> off however, they are attacked by a mutated Kamsky; the same creature who rescued Anna from the sea. Kamsky is desperate for Anna to remain with him on the rig, but Hansen is able to fight him off and kill him. He and Anna then escape in a helicopter as the rig explodes below them.|$|E

25|$|Other {{commentators}} have mentioned {{the influence of}} wealth (e.g. S. M. Lipset, 1959). In a related theory, Ronald Inglehart suggests that improved living-standards can convince people that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> their basic survival for granted, leading to increased emphasis on self-expression values, which is highly correlated to democracy.|$|E

25|$|Education {{is fairly}} rudimentary; {{children}} leave school at age 16, and although <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> GCSEs a year later, few do.

It opened in 1975 and has five classrooms, a kitchen, a stage, a computer room, and a craft and science room.|$|E

25|$|The United States Public Health Service {{recommends}} {{an extra}} 0.4mg/day for newly pregnant women, which <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> as a pill. However, many researchers believe this supplementation can never work effectively enough, since {{about half of}} all pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned, and not all women comply with the recommendation. Approximately 53% of the US population uses dietary supplements and 35% uses dietary supplements that contain folic acid.|$|E
