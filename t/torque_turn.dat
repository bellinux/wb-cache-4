50|$|Corden-Lloyd, as {{commanding}} officer, {{along with}} Captain Philip Schofield and Sergeant Ives flew in a Gazelle helicopter {{from the base}} at Bessbrook Mill to assess the situation and provide information to the troops. While flying low and fast over {{the scene of the}} engagement, the aircraft came under fire from the IRA. The pilot executed a <b>torque</b> <b>turn</b> and, in so doing, stalled his tail fenestron fan rotor and lost control of the aircraft. The helicopter crashed into the field bordered by the March Wall, some 700 meters from Jonesborough. Corden-Lloyd was killed instantly, while the other two passengers were wounded.|$|E
50|$|Loosely speaking, torque is {{a measure}} of the turning force on an object such as a bolt or a flywheel. For example, pushing or pulling the handle of a wrench {{connected}} to a nut or bolt produces a <b>torque</b> (<b>turning</b> force) that loosens or tightens the nut or bolt.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We review recent {{advances}} in rectification control of arti-ficial microswimmers, also known as Janus particles, diffusing along narrow, periodically corrugated channels. The swimmer self-propulsion mechanism is modeled so as to incorporate a nonzero torque (propulsion chirality). We first summarize the effects of chirality on the autonomous current of microswimmers freely diffusing in channels of different geometries. In particular, left-right and upside-down asymmetric chan-nels are shown to exhibit different transport properties. We then report new results on the dependence of the diffusivity of chiral microswim-mers on the channel geometry and their own self-propulsion mech-anism. The self-propulsion <b>torque</b> <b>turns</b> out to {{play a key role}} as a transport control parameter. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Engine {{bench test}} {{research}} has been done on a JL 4 JB 1 diesel engine fueled with compressed natural gas (CNG), and the power performance, load performance and universal performance were obtained, analyzing the performance changing regulations of CNG engine. The results indicate that the maximum <b>torque</b> <b>turns</b> up at the medium speed when the engine operates at power performance points, and the minimum brake specific gas consumption (BSGC) also comes up at medium speed. When the rotating speed keeps constant, BSGC decreases with the torque increasing, and decreasing largely at small load while a little at high load. From the universal performance curve of CNG engine, we can know that the minimum BSGC is 194 g/kW·h...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{synthesis}} of cylindrical magnetic couplings realized with tile permanent magnets whose polarizations can be radial, tangential or axial. The expressions of the torque transmitted between the two rotors of each coupling have been determined by using the coulombian approach. All the calculations have been performed without using any simplifying assumptions. Consequently, the expressions obtained are accurate and enable a fast comparison between all the structures presented in this paper. Strictly speaking, there are two great kinds of couplings generally used in engineering or medical applications. The first ones use a cylindrical air gap though the second ones use a plane air gap. The best configuration for obtaining the greatest <b>torque</b> <b>turns</b> out to be different between couplings using cylindrical or plane air gaps...|$|R

40|$|A {{counterintuitive}} unidirectional (say counterclockwise) {{motion of}} a toy rattleback takes place {{when it is}} started by tapping it at a long side or by spinning it slowly in the clockwise sense of rotation. We study the motion of a toy rattleback having an ellipsoidal-shaped bottom by using frictionless Newton equations of motion of a rigid body rolling without sliding in a plane. We simulate these equations for tapping and spinning initial conditions to see the contact trajectory, the force arm and the reaction force responsible for <b>torque</b> <b>turning</b> the rattleback in the counterclockwise sense of rotation. Long time behavior of such a rattleback is, however, quasi-periodic and a rattleback starting with small transversal oscillations turns in the clockwise direction.

50|$|Coaxial rotors {{solve the}} problem of main rotor <b>torque</b> by <b>turning</b> each set of rotors in {{opposite}} directions. The opposite torques from the rotors cancel each other out. Rotational maneuvering, yaw control, is accomplished by increasing the collective pitch of one rotor and decreasing the collective pitch on the other. This causes a controlled dissymmetry of torque.|$|R

This shared many components from the 3.6V8, and the 4.2 unit was identical to the optional V8 used in the Audi S4 (aka Ur-S4), sharing the same rated outputs and ABH identification code. Like the 3.6V8 model, the existing four-speed automatic gearbox remained available. [...] However, a new six-speed manual gearbox replaced the five-speed manual. This powerplant is identified by chrome 'V8' badges on the front grille and at trunk lid, where in some cars also '4.2 quattro' badge is present.|$|R
40|$|Critical {{experimental}} {{tests of}} the time-dependent Abraham force in phenomenological electrodynamics are scarce. In this paper we analyze the possibility of making use of intensity-modulated whispering gallery modes in a microresonator for this purpose. Systems of this kind appear attractive, as the strong concentration of electromagnetic fields near {{the rim of the}} resonator serves to enhance the Abraham torque exerted by the field. We analyze mainly spherical resonators, although as an introductory step we consider also the cylinder geometry. The order of magnitude of the Abraham torques are estimated by inserting reasonable values for the various input parameters. As expected, the predicted <b>torques</b> <b>turn</b> out to be very small, although probably not beyond any reach experimentally. Our main idea is essentially a generalization of the method used by G. B. Walker et al. [Can. J. Phys. 53, 2577] for low-frequency fields, to the optical case. Comment: 6 pages, no figures.

40|$|Frictional torque is an {{important}} mean for momentum exchange between the atmosphere and earth, and significantly influences the variation in atmospheric angular momentum. Using NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data for the period 1948 - 2011, we examined the spatial and temporal patterns of frictional torque. It {{was found that the}} globally integrated frictional <b>torque</b> <b>turned</b> from positive to negative in 1972, suggesting that angular momentum was transferred from the earth to the atmosphere before 1972, but from the atmosphere to the earth thereafter. The global frictional torque steadily declined from 1948 to 1994, but has been increasing since 1995. It was also found that the global frictional torque is mainly determined by the wind systems in the mid and low latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere (SH), where large changes in frictional torque occurred during the study period. Westerly wind increased continuously in the midlatitudes after 1948, while easterly wind decreased in the tropics of the SH after the 1980 s...|$|R

50|$|Quadcopters {{generally}} use {{two pairs}} of identical fixed pitched propellers; two clockwise (CW) and two counterclockwise (CCW). These use independent variation {{of the speed of}} each rotor to achieve control. By changing the speed of each rotor it is possible to specifically generate a desired total thrust; to locate for the centre of thrust both laterally and longitudinally; and to create a desired total <b>torque,</b> or <b>turning</b> force.|$|R

5|$|Flies tend {{to fly in}} a {{straight}} line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient <b>torque</b> to <b>turn.</b> Detecting this within four or five wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and the fly heads off in a new direction.|$|R

However, the controllability problem appears to be a side-effect while studying the stabilizability.

50|$|The field {{windings}} in the stator of an induction motor {{set up a}} rotating magnetic field through the rotor. The relative motion between this field and the rotor induces electric current in the conductive bars. In turn these currents lengthwise in the conductors react with the magnetic field of the motor to produce force acting at a tangent orthogonal to the rotor, resulting in <b>torque</b> to <b>turn</b> the shaft. In effect the rotor is carried around with the magnetic field but at a slightly slower rate of rotation. The difference in speed is called slip and increases with load.|$|R

The radial cutting edges remove a slice of wood of {{thickness}} equal to the pitch of the central screw for each rotation of the bit. To pull the bit from the hole, either the female thread in the wood workpiece must be stripped, or the rotation of the bit must be reversed.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} ram BOPs of the 1920s {{were simple}} and rugged manual devices with minimal parts. The BOP housing (body) had a vertical well bore and horizontal ram cavity (ram guide chamber). Opposing rams (plungers) in the ram cavity translated horizontally, actuated by threaded ram shafts (piston rods) {{in the manner}} of a screw jack. <b>Torque</b> from <b>turning</b> the ram shafts by wrench or hand wheel was converted to linear motion and the rams, coupled to the inner ends of the ram shafts, opened and closed the well bore. Such screw jack type operation provided enough mechanical advantage for rams to overcome downhole pressures and seal the wellbore annulus.|$|R
5000|$|The DC motor was the {{mainstay}} of electric traction drives on both electric and diesel-electric locomotives, street-cars/trams and diesel electric drilling rigs for many years. It consists of two parts, a rotating armature and fixed field windings surrounding the rotating armature mounted around a shaft. The fixed field windings consist of tightly wound coils of wire fitted inside the motor case. The armature is another set of coils wound round a central shaft and {{is connected to the}} field windings through [...] "brushes" [...] which are spring-loaded contacts pressing against an extension of the armature called the commutator. The commutator collects all the terminations of the armature coils and distributes them in a circular pattern to allow the correct sequence of current flow. When the armature and the field windings are connected in series, the whole motor is referred to as [...] "series-wound". A series-wound DC motor has a low resistance field and armature circuit. Because of this, when voltage is applied to it, the current is high due to Ohm's law. The advantage of high current is that the magnetic fields inside the motor are strong, producing high <b>torque</b> (<b>turning</b> force), so it is ideal for starting a train. The disadvantage is that the current flowing into the motor has to be limited, otherwise the supply could be overloaded or the motor and its cabling could be damaged. At best, the torque would exceed the adhesion and the driving wheels would slip. Traditionally, resistors were used to limit the initial current.|$|R
50|$|Trimmers {{that have}} nylon or metal blades usually require {{straight}} driveshafts {{to handle the}} higher <b>torque</b> required to <b>turn</b> the heavier disk, {{and because of the}} shock loads that are passed back from the blade to the drive shaft and its gearbox(es). Smaller line trimmers have curved driveshafts to make holding the cutting-head at ground level much easier and with less strain on the operator.|$|R
50|$|A {{differential}} screw is {{a mechanism}} used for making small, precise {{adjustments to the}} spacing between two objects (such as in focusing a microscope, moving the anvils of a micrometer, or positioning optics). A differential screw uses a spindle with two screw threads of differing leads (aka thread pitch), and possibly opposite handedness, on which two nuts move. As the spindle rotates, {{the space between the}} nuts changes based on the difference between the threads. These mechanisms allow extremely small adjustments using commonly available screws. A differential screw mechanism using two nuts incurs higher friction and therefore requires more <b>torque</b> to <b>turn</b> than a simple, single lead screw with an equivalent pitch.|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedIn this investigation, fluid {{dynamics}} of a spherical particle in a rotating liquid sphere is studied. Such problems arise during protein crystal growth by the containerless approach {{in which a}} drop of protein solution is levitated against gravity, and rotated steadily by a torque from an acoustic field. Viscosity of the solution {{is assumed to be}} sufficiently high such that viscous force dominates and the second-order effects in the acoustic field do not penetrate the drop surface. The analysis is carried out at very small Reynolds and Taylor numbers for which the fluid flow is treated by Stokes approximation. With a given geometric configuration, the velocity field is calculated and used to determine the particle velocity at a given time. By integrating the particle velocity, the particle path is obtained and used for optimizing the rotation rate of the drop in an attempt to keep the particle fully contained in the drop.; In addition, the transient dynamics of a rotating levitated liquid drop in unbounded gaseous fluid is investigated. A liquid drop is considered to experience two different fundamental transients, one when the <b>torque</b> is <b>turned</b> off and another when the <b>torque</b> is <b>turned</b> on. The motion of the fluids in the drop interior and surroundings is described by the Stokes equations with the time-derivative term included. The solutions are obtained analytically by the Laplace transform technique. The results show that the transient effects caused by the applied torque are relatively small for the high-viscosity solution considered. Hence, for most applications of containerless protein crystal growth, the liquid drop may be assumed to rotate like a solid body while allowing the solid particle relative motion within that framework...|$|R

The average, 0. 6 g·cm/deg, equals 0. 5 g if applied at the radius of the globe. This value is rather low compared to the values obtained by other authors for horizontal eye movements.

40|$|The Power Ratchet Tool (PRT) is a self contained, power-driven, 3 / 8 {{inch drive}} ratchet wrench {{which will be}} used by astronauts during Extravehicular Activities (EVA). This {{battery-powered}} tool is controlled by a dedicated electonic controller. The PRT was flown during the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Deployment Mission STS- 31 to deploy the solar arrays if the automatic mechanisms failed. The PRT is currently intended for use during the first HST Servicing Mission STS- 61 as a general purpose power tool. The PRT consists of three major components; the wrench, the controller, and the battery module. Fourteen discrete combinations of <b>torque,</b> <b>turns,</b> and speed may be programmed into the controller before the EVA. The crewmember selects the desired parameter profile by a switch mounted on the controller. The tool may also {{be used in the}} manual mode as a non-powered ratchet wrench. The power is provided by a silver-zinc battery module, which fits into the controller and is replaceable during an EVA. The original PRT did not meet the design specification of torque output and hours of operation. To increase efficiency and reliability the PRT underwent a redesign effort. The majority of this effort focused on the wrench. The original PRT drive train consisted of a low torque, high speed brushless DC motor, a face gear set, and a planocentric gear assembly. The total gear reduction was 300 : 1. The new PRT wrench consists of a low speed, high torque brushless DC motor, two planetary gear sets and a bevel gear set. The total gear reduction is now 75 : 1. A spline clutch has also been added to disengage the drive train in the manual mode. The design changes to the controller will consist of only those modifications necessary to accomodate the redesigned wrench. The battery design will be unaffected...|$|R
