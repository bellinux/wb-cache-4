25|$|Penderel Moon simply {{attributes}} the League's {{rise to power}} to the alluring and irresistible appeal of the Pakistan cry to the Muslim masses. Peter Hardy's explained that the Muslim League gained its electoral success in the Punjab by making a religious appeal {{over the heads of}} the professional politicians. Pakistani historians have explained the League's success in the Punjab, as elsewhere in the subcontinent, solely in terms of the Two Nation Theory. Whatever the historians may suggest, one <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> that League's success was due to the political vision, farsightedness of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He was a man of high personal integrity and intelligence who became a Grandmaster of the game by his clever, and clever calculations.|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{sounds pretty}} fishy to me," [...] {{returned}} Dick. [...] "Still, I won't condemn you until this whole <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>cleared</b> up. Just now we've {{got to find}} those young ladies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{content to}} believe myself very lucky in {{having such a}} friend as you,' said Ferdinand; 'but now as these <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>cleared</b> away, let us talk over affairs. Have you seen Henrietta?' ...|$|R
60|$|But {{although}} he was ignorant of the real facts of the matter, one <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> to Ralph. He {{did not want to}} buy, and {{he was not going to}} be forced into doing so.|$|R
60|$|BERTLEY. [Severely.] I do not know, sir, that {{we shall}} get any great {{assistance}} from your views. In fact, one <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> to me, she must discontinue your acquaintanceship at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{give you}} up," [...] I retorted, shrugging my shoulders. [...] "Only one <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear,</b> {{and that is}} that the devil doesn't want you. Report of your singing has gone before you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, come!" [...] said Summerhaye, {{opening his}} lips {{for the first}} time. [...] "Surely the whole <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> as daylight. The man's caught red-handed. How he could be such a fool beats me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will make}} {{considerable}} difference, as you'll find out before this <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>cleared</b> up," [...] and the cashier {{moved toward the}} door as if to prevent the boy from leaving the building. [...] "Why not tell the truth, and say you stole the money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|S. [...] "So that, {{until such}} a man's error {{concerning}} Zeus, {{the source of}} all <b>things,</b> <b>is</b> <b>cleared</b> up, either in this life or in some future one, we cannot but fear for him infinite confusion, misery, and harm, in all matters which he may take in hand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Two <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>clear</b> to me," [...] I said, {{addressing}} {{my three}} companions, who stared at this spectacle in dismay: [...] "first, that we can't go across there" [...] (I {{pointed to the}} swamp), [...] "and, secondly, that if we stop here we shall certainly die of fever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{servant of}} yours makes my flesh creep, Juanna," [...] said Leonard. [...] "One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> enough, {{we must not}} allow her to overhear any more of our plans; she knows a great deal too much already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You must be right,' said Logan. 'I'll {{have the}} stones removed to-morrow. The <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear.</b> The passage leads to somewhere {{outside of the}} house. There's an {{abandoned}} coal mine hard by, on the east. Nothing can be simpler.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The page {{sighed and}} looked down. [...] "Would my {{conviction}} were {{as deep as}} thine! But one <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear,</b> that in this captivity she hath wrong--She rendered herself up, on a capitulation, and the terms have been refused her--I will embrace her quarrel to the death!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've kept {{me under}} observation," [...] he cried, [...] "all this time. I haven't {{attempted}} to escape. I haven't moved from New York. I haven't the slightest {{intention of doing}} so until this <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>cleared</b> up. Can't you take my parole? Can't you leave me alone until they come from England?" ...|$|R
60|$|And, {{while my}} blood boiled, I remembered the priest, Martinelli, and the gray old man at Rome. The <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear.</b> It <b>was</b> deliberate. It was the long arm. Fortini smiled lazily at me while I thus paused {{for the moment}} to debate, but in his smile was the essence of all insolence.|$|R
50|$|P-Orridge's website {{stated that}} she had not quit Throbbing Gristle and had just stopped {{participating}} on the current tour; it also said that an explanation would be released when all <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> up. However, on 24 November 2010, Christopherson died in his sleep at the age of 55, and the band subsequently dissolved.|$|R
6000|$|... "His Grace's letter, milor," [...] he {{said with}} final supreme condescension, and holding the {{document}} out to M. le Contrôleur, who took it without a word. [...] "Do you glance through it, and see {{that we have not}} been mistaken, that the whole <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear,</b> straightforward and----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Under the circumstances, presuming {{them to be}} {{accurately}} stated, I am {{not prepared}} to say who is to be congratulated or who should thank Providence. These things are so individual, are they not? But if one <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear,</b> whatever else she is or is not, Miss Fregelius cannot be a fortune-hunter, although she must want money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "NOW I reckon the <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> {{to you at}} last. In {{the other}} case the moving and {{steering}} was done by turning a peg. We touch a button, the prince turned a peg. There ain't an atom of difference, you see. I knowed I could git it through your head if I stuck to it long enough." ...|$|E
60|$|He turned, {{and looked}} at Nares who, after a {{momentary}} shrinking, steadily met his gaze. The man was wholly honest, and the <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> to him. He had struck at last, shrewdly, in a righteous cause, and nobody could have blamed him, but, as had happened in his comrade's case, human bitterness had also nerved the blow.|$|R
5000|$|Refusing {{to stick}} to a single genre, he also {{directed}} the mockumentary Dark Side of the Moon (2002). In The Empire State Building Murders (2008) he combines clips from film noir and recent interviews with actors to tell a narrative story. He likes to recall François Truffaut's words, [...] "A documentary is one thousand times more of a lie than a fiction, where <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>clear</b> from the beginning".|$|R
6000|$|His {{mind was}} rather hazy {{concerning}} the damage suit. Only one <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> to him, {{and that was}} that he had not got any damages. He had a feeling that the testimony of the foremen and the superintendent had brought about the adverse decision of the court. Their testimony, as he put it, [...] "wasn't what it ought to have ben." [...] And to them I resolved to go.|$|R
60|$|One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear,</b> {{that a man}} may speak {{very well}} in the House of Commons, and fail very {{completely}} in the House of Lords. There are two distinct styles requisite: I intend, {{in the course of my}} career, if I have time, to give a specimen of both. In the Lower House Don Juan may perhaps be our model; in the Upper House, Paradise Lost.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{much alike}} mothers are in all classes of life," [...] thought Rachel, and {{much in the}} way in which she would have brought Zack's mother to reason by threats of {{expulsion}} from the shoe-club, she observed, [...] "Well Fanny, one <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear,</b> while you are so weak as to let that boy go on in his deceit, unrepentant and unpunished, I can have no more to do with his education." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A thousand-but, what is $1000 {{a year to}} {{a fashionable}} man, in a town like this. First and last, the {{excellent}} old lady, gave me about $5000, all of which confirms the idea, that, at the bottom, she intended me for her heir. What woman in her senses, would think of giving $5000 to a relative to whom she did not contemplate giving more? The <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> on its face, and I should certainly go into chancery, with anybody but Lucy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Small wonder I {{was slow}} of speech. For the moment there was but one thought in my brain. After all the strange play I had seen played out, {{to have this}} come upon me! I did not misunderstand. The <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear.</b> A great woman was mine if [...] . if I betrayed Rome. For Pilate was governor, his order had gone forth; and his voice {{was the voice of}} Rome.|$|R
60|$|Long {{after he}} had passed she remained, a girl of stone, staring down through the branches. All her power of action had gone from her. She gripped by {{instinct}} with {{hands and knees and}} feet. It was some time before she could think, and then only one <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> in her mind, that the Terror was between her and the tribe--that {{it would be impossible to}} descend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} Prince, {{when the door}} was at length shut, [...] "one <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> quite <b>clear.</b> He does not know who Beckendorff is." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now {{what has}} made this change in the rook? We do not exactly know. [...] One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear,</b> that the {{particles}} of the now solid rock have actually moved on themselves. And this is proved by a very curious fact--which the reader, if he geologises about slate quarries much, may see with his own eyes. The fossils in the slate are often distorted into quaint shapes, pulled out long if they lie along the plane of cleavage, or squeezed together, or doubled down on both sides, if they lie across the plane. So that some force has been at work which could actually change the shape of hard shells, very slowly, no doubt, else it would have snapped and crumbled them.|$|E
60|$|One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> to me, however, {{and over}} that I rejoice and triumph greatly. If you can esteem this poem of 'Grace Darling,' you must be {{susceptible}} to the grandeur and beauty of the poems which preceded it; {{and the cause of}} your past reluctance to recognise the poet's power must be, as I have always suspected, from your having given a very partial attention and consideration to his poetry. You were partial in your attention I, perhaps, was injudicious in my extracts; but with your truth and his genius, I cannot doubt but that the time will come for your mutual amity. Oh that I could stand as a herald of peace, with my wool-twisted fillet! I do not understand the Greek metres as well as you do, but I understand Wordsworth's genius better, and do you forgive that it should console me.|$|E
60|$|Of course, {{the genesis}} of the <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> enough. He had chanced to visit the inn, and had been {{impressed}} as I had been by the same train of thought. All that is quite intelligible. But what is perfectly marvellous is that in that short journey I should have chanced to buy the one book in all the world which would prevent me from making a public fool of myself, for who would ever have believed that my work was not an imitation? I do not think that the hypothesis of coincidence can cover the facts. It is one of several incidents in my life which have convinced me of spiritual interposition--of the promptings of some beneficent force outside ourselves, which tries to help us where it can. The old Catholic doctrine of the Guardian Angel is not only a beautiful one, but has in it, I believe, a real basis of truth.|$|E
50|$|As the <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>clear</b> both {{producers}} {{hunt for}} the character of Ghulam-e-Mustafa, many options were on the list, but both of them {{decided to take the}} role of Mustafa to Nana Patekar without any screen test, fist Juhi Chawla was approached for the role of Kavita, but Juhi walked out due to her already lined up filming schedules, later on Raveena gave the screen test for Kavita and got the role.|$|R
6000|$|IV:3:35 [...] LEON. [...] Is it the Carnival? What mummery's this? [...] What have I heard? One <b>thing</b> alone <b>is</b> <b>clear.</b> [...] We must {{be rid of}} Oran.|$|R
60|$|One <b>thing,</b> however, <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> to me now--this great {{campaign}} {{that was being}} waged between the nurse and the Professor had reference {{to the case of}} Dr. Yorke-Bannerman.|$|R
