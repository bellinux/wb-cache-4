5|$|In the women's event, Germany's Silke Kraushaar {{leads the}} medal count with three, {{one of each}} color. Steffi Martin and Sylke Otto—at 36, the oldest female {{individual}} gold medalist at the Winter Games—are the only lugers with two gold medals in their career. Ortrun Enderlein, representing the Unified Team of Germany, {{was the first woman}} to win the singles event in 1964. She {{was on the verge of}} defending her title at the 1968 Grenoble Games, having the best overall time after all <b>the</b> <b>runs,</b> but was disqualified together with fellow countrywomen Anna-Maria Müller (2nd) and Angela Knösel (4th) when it was discovered that the runners in their sleds had been illegally heated before <b>the</b> <b>runs.</b> Müller made up for this by taking the gold medal at the following Games, in Sapporo, Japan.|$|E
5|$|McCabe scored 60 of the 70 runs that Australia {{added on}} the second day to finish 187 not out from 233 balls as Australia were bowled out for 360. McCabe added <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> in just one hour of batting and ended with 25 {{boundaries}} in his innings, which lasted a little over four hours. He was particularly effectively in farming the strike while batting with his tail end partners; in his last wicket stand of 55 with Tim Wall, he scored 50 of <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> in just half an hour.|$|E
5|$|Over 300,000 {{people took}} part and raised $3.5 {{million in the}} first Terry Fox Run. Schools across Canada were urged to join the second run, held on September 19, 1982. School {{participation}} has continued since, evolving into the National School Run Day. <b>The</b> <b>runs,</b> which raised over $20 million in its first six years, grew into an international event as over one million people in 60 countries took part in 1999, raising $15 million that year alone. By the Terry Fox Run's 25th anniversary, more than three million people were taking part annually. Grants from the Terry Fox Foundation, which organizes <b>the</b> <b>runs,</b> have helped Canadian scientists make numerous advances in cancer research. The Terry Fox Run is the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research, and over $600 million has been raised in his name. The 30th Terry Fox Run was held September 19, 2010.|$|E

5|$|The alpine runs (Le piste alpine) {{were built}} {{on the slopes of}} Monte Tofana and Monte Faloria in the nearby Dolomite alps. The men's and women's {{downhill}} and slalom races were held on Tofana. Faloria was the site of the two giant slalom events. It took nearly two years to complete construction of <b>the</b> <b>runs.</b> In previous years, lack of snow was never an issue, but in the winter of 1956 there was insufficient snowfall for skiers to safely navigate <b>the</b> <b>runs.</b> As a consequence, snow had to be transported {{from other parts of the}} mountains by the Italian army.|$|E
5|$|This left Australia {{a target}} of 404 runs for victory. At the time, {{this would have been}} the highest ever run-chase to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, but they scored <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> with 15 minutes to spare and seven wickets in hand, sealing the series 30.|$|E
5|$|Further delay meant play {{began after}} the tea break, and the pitch played very slowly {{because of the}} excess moisture, which also caused there to be little bounce in the surface. With Australia not looking to chase <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> because the time {{available}} was not reasonable, Yardley often had seven men in close catching positions. In the first half hour, Australia showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Young replaced Pollard and Johnson immediately swept him for four, before edging the next ball to Crapp, who completed the catch. Johnson fell for six to leave Australia at 10/1.|$|E

5|$|On {{the second}} morning, Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand ended with Hassett's fall for 37. The {{following}} four batsmen {{were unable to}} establish themselves at the crease and none passed 20. Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving; it took a run out to remove Morris. Australia were eventually out for 389. Morris had scored more than half <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> {{as the rest of}} the team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. England had relied heavily on spin; two thirds of the overs were delivered by the two spinners.|$|E

40|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>run</b> length {{distribution}} is generally highly skewed, a significant concern about focusing {{too much on}} <b>the</b> average <b>run</b> length (ARL) criterion is that we may miss some crucial information about a control chart’s performance. Thus {{it is important to}} investigate <b>the</b> entire <b>run</b> length distribution of a control chart for an in-depth understanding before implementing the chart in process monitoring. In this paper, the percentiles of <b>the</b> <b>run</b> length distribution for the double sampling (DS) X chart with estimated process parameters are computed. Knowledge of the percentiles of <b>the</b> <b>run</b> length distribution provides a more comprehensive understanding of the expected behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>run</b> length. This additional information includes the early false alarm, the skewness of <b>the</b> <b>run</b> length distribution, and <b>the</b> median <b>run</b> length (MRL). A comparison of <b>the</b> <b>run</b> length distribution between the optimal ARL-based and MRL-based DS X chart with estimated process parameters is presented in this paper. Examples of applications are given to aid practitioners to select the best design scheme of the DS X chart with estimated process parameters, based on their specific purpose...|$|R
5|$|After {{almost three}} years in the wilderness, Fingleton {{returned}} to the Test arena in the First Test at Durban. After making two in the first innings, he was unbeaten on 36 when Australia reached their second innings target with nine wickets in hand. During the first innings, a 140km/h gale hit the ground, uprooting trees and forcing balls that were heading into the wind to do U-turns. He followed this with 62—the innings top-score—and 40 in the Second Test at Johannesburg. After taking a 93-run first innings lead, Australia needed a Test record of 399 in the second innings to win on a turning wicket, and after the early demise of Brown, Fingleton joined McCabe in a 177-run partnership that pushed the score to 1/194. Such was the dominance of McCabe that he scored more than 80% of <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> during this partnership. Australia needed only 125 with half the day remaining and eight wickets in hand when poor visibility ended play. McCabe had flayed the attack and reached 189 not out when the South Africans had the match called off, claiming that the fieldsmen were endangered by the batsman's vigorous hitting.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{their second}} innings after lunch, {{there was a}} little {{improvement}} for the Smokers, though six of the team were dismissed without reaching double figures. Gunn top-scored for his side, remaining 43 not {{out at the end of}} the innings, while Charles Thornton and George Giffen both scored quickly, making 27 and 15 respectively. Despite these scores, the Smokers only reached 152, leaving the Non-Smokers needing 14 runs to win the match. Grace collected three further wickets in this second innings, but he was bettered by Barlow, who took five for 24. Although the match was past half past five in the evening with poor light, the decision was made that the match should not continue into the following day, and so the Non-Smokers came out to bat and hit <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> they required, reaching the total shortly after six o'clock. The match was played at Lord's in good weather on both days, and was well attended on the first day, with between six and seven thousand spectators at the ground.|$|E
5|$|Compton and Evans {{continued}} {{to resist the}} Australians on the final morning, the latter being the more aggressive, and proceedings were briefly interrupted by rain less than 30 minutes {{after the start of}} play. At the time, it appeared the downpour might cause the match to end in a draw. After half an hour of stoppages, play resumed and Evans attacked, hitting two fours in quick succession. England's wicket-keeper played Johnston and Johnson confidently, but Bradman nevertheless persisted in giving Compton easy singles in order to bring Evans on strike so he could be targeted. For his part, Compton thought his partner could be relied upon and accepted <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> gifted to him by the Australian captain, while Evans {{continued to}} attack the bowling. The batsmen appealed against the light after the first stoppage of the day, but were turned down. Australia took the new ball, but the home team's batsmen continued to proceed steadily, Evans being particularly aggressive. After a second interruption for poor light, this time for ten minutes, play resumed, and England had added a further 60 runs to their overnight total to reach 405/6.|$|E

30|$|NESCA, a newly {{discovered}} signaling adapter protein in the NGF-pathway, contains a RUN domain at its N-terminus. Here we report the crystal structure of <b>the</b> NESCA <b>RUN</b> domain determined at 2.0 -Å resolution. The overall fold of <b>the</b> NESCA <b>RUN</b> domain comprises nine helices, resembling <b>the</b> <b>RUN</b> domain of RPIPx and <b>the</b> <b>RUN</b> 1 domain of Rab 6 IP 1. However, compared to <b>the</b> other <b>RUN</b> domains, <b>the</b> <b>RUN</b> domain of NESCA has significantly different surface electrostatic distributions at the putative GTPase-interacting interface. We demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>RUN</b> domain of NESCA can bind H-Ras, a downstream signaling molecule of TrkA, with high affinity. Moreover, NESCA RUN can directly interact with TrkA. These results provide {{new insights into}} how NESCA participates in the NGF-TrkA signaling pathway.|$|R
5|$|Formby's {{health was}} further damaged in the {{influenza}} pandemic of 1918, {{during which he}} contracted the disease while appearing at the Manchester Hippodrome {{and was unable to}} work for a month. He was taken ill during <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> of pantomimes in both 1918 and 1919, was forced to rest for three months in 1919, and collapsed on stage during a performance in Newcastle upon Tyne in the 1920–21 pantomime season. Formby was advised by doctors to emigrate to South Africa for the benefit of his health, but he preferred to stay in Britain, with his wife and children, and continued to work. During his performances his wife would wait in the wings with ice for him to suck to stop internal bleeding, and an oxygen tent was present in the stage wings ready for emergencies.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{came in and}} {{accompanied}} Morris for 39 further runs before falling to Edrich. Lindwall fell for nine before Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving. It took a run out to remove Morris; he attempted a quick run after the ball was hit to third man. Morris was called through for a run by Don Tallon, {{but he was too}} slow for the substitute fielder Reg Simpson's arm. Australia went on to finish with 389. Morris had scored more than half <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> {{as the rest of the}} team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. Hollies tossed the ball up repeatedly, coaxing the Australians into attacking balls that spun after pitching on off stump. Morris took four catches for the match as Australia took victory by an innings and 149 runs, sealing a 40 Test series triumph.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} 1947–48 season, Harvey was {{called into the}} Victorian team for the Sheffield Shield match against New South Wales and made his debut {{alongside}} Merv and Neil, who were already established players. Merv opened, while Neil and Ray batted at Nos. 4 and 7 respectively. Victoria batted first and the brothers again did not form any partnerships as they were always out before the next sibling came in to bat. Ray came in at 5/208 to make 43. Victoria ended with 331 and the Harvey brothers had scored almost half <b>the</b> <b>runs.</b> New South Wales were forced to follow on and Victoria were set 51 for victory. After the fall of Fred Freer at 1/24, captain Lindsay Hassett elevated Ray to No. 3, allowing two Harveys to bat {{together for the first}} time at first-class level. Ray and Merv put on an unbeaten partnership of 27 to take Victoria to a nine-wicket win. Merv and Ray ended unbeaten on 12 and 22 respectively.|$|E
30|$|As {{the number}} of {{variables}} of the FTTC-TMBF and HFTTC-TMBF methods is very high and their algorithm structures are very complex, comparing their complexities analytically is very difficult (if not impossible). So, we preferred to measure <b>the</b> <b>run</b> time {{as an indication of}} the complexity degree of the algorithms. In order to measure <b>the</b> <b>run</b> times of <b>the</b> algorithms, both methods FTTC-TMBF and HFTTC-TMBF are again simulated. In a certain scenario with 10 nodes and 5 non-overlapping channels, <b>the</b> <b>run</b> time needed for convergence was 356 [*]min for FTTC-TMBF, while in HFTTC-TMBF, <b>the</b> <b>run</b> time reduced to 15.5 [*]min. For different scenarios, <b>the</b> <b>run</b> time of FTTC-TMBF is roughly 20 – 30 times of the HFTTC-TMBF.|$|R

5|$|Mukilteo {{is served}} by the eight daily Sounder trains on weekdays, running on the North Line along the Puget Sound between Everett Station and King Street Station in Seattle. <b>The</b> <b>runs</b> are split between four morning and four {{afternoon}} runs, with a single round-trip gameday service provided for weekend events at CenturyLink Field and Safeco Field. Train service on the corridor, which includes BNSF freight traffic and Amtrak passenger service, is frequently disrupted and canceled during the autumn and winter seasons because of landslides from unstable slopes above the tracks. During the 2012–2013 winter season, a record-high of 206 passenger trains between Everett and Seattle were canceled, prompting the Washington State Department of Transportation to begin a three-year landslide mitigation project in 2013 that will stabilize slopes above the railroad between Seattle and Everett.|$|E
5|$|Neil {{returned}} to the Victorian team for the match against New South Wales at the SCG the following week, and Ray was selected to make his first-class debut, so three Harveys were in the state team for the first time. Merv opened, while Neil and Ray batted at Nos. 4 and 7 respectively. Victoria batted first and the brothers again did not form any partnerships. Merv opened and made 45 as Victoria ended with 331; the Harvey brothers had scored almost half <b>the</b> <b>runs.</b> New South Wales were forced to follow on, and Victoria were set 51 for victory. After the fall of Fred Freer at 1/24, captain Lindsay Hassett elevated Ray to No. 3, allowing two Harveys to bat {{together for the first}} time at first-class level.

5|$|Nevertheless, Brown was {{successful}} in the tour matches when he played as an opener. He ended the tour with eight centuries {{and a total of}} 1,448 first-class runs at an average of 57.92, behind only Bradman, Hassett and Morris in <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> and averages, with a highest score of 200 against Cambridge University. Brown's tally of eight centuries was second only to Bradman, and took his tally on English soil to 18 first-class tons. Excluding the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and the first two Tests, in which Brown had scored 25, 26, 17, 24 and 32 batting in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened, Brown scored 1,324 runs at 66.20 while opening in the other matches, which would have put him in a clear fourth place on the batting averages. Following his omission from the Test team midway through the tour, Brown batted in a slow and conservative manner in order to score more runs and regain his position, much to the chagrin of the crowds.|$|E
