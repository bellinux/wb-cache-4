5|$|Alignment {{with the}} Indonesian government, however, did not {{guarantee}} safety for the Torajans. In 1965, a presidential decree required every Indonesian citizen {{to belong to}} one of five officially recognised religions: Islam, Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), Hinduism, or Buddhism. The Torajan religious belief (aluk) was not legally recognised, and the Torajans raised <b>their</b> <b>voices</b> against the law. To make aluk accord with the law, {{it had to be}} accepted as part of one of the official religions. In 1969, Aluk To Dolo ("the way of ancestors") was legalised as a sect of Agama Hindu Dharma, the official name of Hinduism in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Blackwell {{also served}} on the Democratic National Committee and as {{co-chairman}} of the Mississippi Democratic Party. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party sent Blackwell and three other delegates to the 1964 Democratic National Convention in New Jersey. <b>Their</b> <b>voices</b> heard at the Convention helped contribute {{to the passage of}} the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. In late 1982 Blackwell went to the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and received a Master's Degree in Regional Planning. Although Blackwell did not attend high school, the National Rural Fellows Program helped her gain admittance to the University of Massachusetts by awarding her a scholarship and providing her credit based on activism and life experience.|$|E
5|$|Massenet's Parisian audiences were greatly {{attracted}} by the exotic in music, and Massenet willingly obliged, with musical evocations of far-flung places or times long past. Macdonald lists {{a great number of}} locales depicted in the operas, from ancient Egypt, mythical Greece and biblical Galilee to Renaissance Spain, India and Revolutionary Paris. Massenet's practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man and his careful training at the Conservatoire equipped him to make such effects without much recourse to unusual instruments. He understood the capabilities of his singers, and composed with close, detailed regard for <b>their</b> <b>voices.</b>|$|E

Veteran voice actors Dee Bradley Baker, Wes Johnson, Paul Eiding, and Stephen Russell also provided voice-overs for the game. The Fallout 3 soundtrack continued the series' convention of featuring sentimental 1940s American big band music, including the main theme, {{and a few other}} incidental songs recorded by The Ink Spots and The Andrews Sisters, as well as other artists like Roy Brown, Billie Holiday, Billy Munn, Cole Porter, and Bob Crosby.|$|E

5|$|The storyline {{was written}} by former Star Trek writer D.C. Fontana, while the script was created by John Meredyth Lucas. A promotional cereal {{competition}} was run in conjunction with Quaker Oats, the first for the license in the United States. Despite this promotion, the game was cancelled with estimates placing it at only 5% completion. The cast of The Original Series had already recorded <b>their</b> <b>voices.</b> Lead engineer Thom Robertson later explained the studio had underestimated {{the cost of the}} game and the difficulties in filming the clay models.|$|E
40|$|Background The {{frequency}} {{components of}} the human voice {{play a major role}} in signalling the gender of the speaker. A voice imitation study was conducted to investigate individuals' ability to make behavioural adjustments to fundamental frequency (F 0), and formants (Fi) in order to manipulate <b>their</b> expression of <b>voice</b> gender. Methodology/Principal Findings Thirty-two native British-English adult speakers were asked to read out loud different types of text (words, sentence, passage) using <b>their</b> normal <b>voice</b> and then while sounding as ‘masculine’ and ‘feminine’ as possible. Overall, the results show that both men and women raised their F 0 and Fi when feminising <b>their</b> <b>voice,</b> and lowered <b>their</b> F 0 and Fi when masculinising <b>their</b> <b>voice.</b> Conclusions/Significance These observations suggest that adult speakers are capable of spontaneous glottal and vocal tract length adjustments to express masculinity and femininity in <b>their</b> <b>voice.</b> These results point to a “gender code”, where speakers make a conventionalized use of the existing sex dimorphism to vary the expression of their gender and gender-related attributes...|$|R

5|$|Thomas Edison's British headquarters, Edison House, was {{situated}} on the road. Several prominent personalities of the late 19th century had <b>their</b> <b>voices</b> recorded there by phonograph, including Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone and poet Robert Browning. Mary Helen Ferguson, the first English female audio typist, worked at Edison House and supervised all musical recordings. In 1890, retired military trumpeter Martin Lanfried recorded at Edison House using a bugle he {{believed to have been}} sounded at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and the Charge of the Light Brigade in 1854.|$|E
5|$|Werber {{imposed a}} stern {{training}} regimen on Guard, Shane, and Reynolds, rehearsing them for {{six to eight}} hours a day for several months, sending them to prominent San Francisco vocal coach Judy Davis to help them learn to preserve <b>their</b> <b>voices,</b> and working on the group's carefully prepared but apparently spontaneous banter between songs. At the same time, the group was developing a varied and eclectic repertoire of calypso, folk, and foreign language songs, suggested by all three of the musicians though usually arranged by Guard with some harmonies created by Reynolds.|$|E

Furthermore, teachers consistently attributed these <b>voice</b> symptoms to <b>their</b> occupation and {{were significantly more likely to}} indicate that <b>their</b> <b>voice</b> limited <b>their</b> ability to perform certain tasks at work, and had reduced activities or interactions as a result.
