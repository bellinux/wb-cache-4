Unlike many other paintings of battles, the Battle of Grunwald does not separate the viewer from the action; instead it places him at <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Matejko said he felt like a [...] "possessed man" [...] while he made the painting.|$|E
500|$|It was {{reported}} that Loeb had taken advice from a [...] "number of real Wall Street movers and shakers" [...] to ensure [...] "horrifying accuracy" [...] for the film's script. Of the re-writes done to script, Stone said: [...] "We sort of started over {{with the story of}} a young man who is at <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and how he needs Gordon Gekko's help to navigate those waters." [...] In a reference to the GEICO Gecko commercial, which was suggested by New York Governor David Paterson, Gekko says [...] "even a caveman could do it" [...] in the movie. At the request of Mulligan and LaBeouf, the filmmaker cut some dialogue from the character's break-up scenes, which he at first was initially hesitant to do.|$|E
500|$|She {{returned}} to the stage while wearing [...] multiple donned braided extensions for [...] "Paparazzi". Gaga was perched atop a railing and from each of her braids, a dancer was attached on the stage. A backdrop of stars were shown during the performance. The performance ended with the railing taking Gaga high above the stage, where she faked her death. This was followed by [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] as she descended from the top—which signified her rebirth—amidst white lights and mechanical fog. She wore a giant gyroscope around her, akin to [...] "The Orbit" [...] by Haus of Gaga. The last song of the show was [...] "Bad Romance" [...] which she performed in an '80s-inspired white power suit with exaggerated high shoulders and high-waisted pants.

500|$|Since its release, {{the cover}} art of Illmatic has also gained an iconic {{reputation}} [...] having {{been subject to}} numerous parodies and tributes. Music columnist Byron Crawford later called the cover for Illmatic [...] "one of the dopest album covers ever in hip-hop." [...] Commenting on the cover's artistic value, Rob Marriott of Complex writes, [...] "Illmatic's poignant cover matched the mood, tone, and qualities of this introspective album to such a high degree that it became an instant classic, hailed as a visual full of meaning and nuance." [...] XXL magazine called the album cover a [...] "high art photo concept for a rap album" [...] and described the artwork as a [...] "noisy, confusing streetscape looking through the housing projects and a young boy superimposed in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all." [...] The XXL columnist also compared the cover to that of rapper Lil Wayne's sixth studio album Tha Carter III (2008), stating that it also [...] "reflects the reality of disenfranchised youth today." ...|$|E

For [...] "Who You Really Are", the producers enlisted Marcos Martín to create the poster, which highlighted Sif's (Jaimie Alexander) return to the show, as well as an [...] "inside look" [...] at S.H.I.E.L.D. as the logo crumbles, with Skye in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> ambiguously leaving the viewer questioning if the logo was crumbling due to Sif's sword, or Skye's powers. The third poster, for [...] "One of Us", was created by Declan Shalvey and Jordie Bellaire. It features muted colors and shows [...] "Coulson surrounded by villains , and the giant Cal looming over, and [...] S.H.I.E.L.D. behind him." [...] Annie Wu was brought on for the [...] "Love in the Time of Hydra" [...] poster, which shows Grant Ward holding a woman, though depicts her as two; one drawn in red, the other in blue – [...] "half of that goes to Agent 33, who has two faces...

500|$|For {{her work}} as Sue Ellen, Gray was {{nominated}} for a Primetime Emmy Award in the category [...] "Best Actress in a Drama Series" [...] in 1981 (Barbara Bel Geddes who played Miss Ellie Ewing was also nominated in that category for Dallas that year). Gray was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award in both 1980 and 1981 in the category of [...] "Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Drama" [...] respectively. The character of Sue Ellen was well received by television critics. The Biography Channel said, [...] "Who could ever forget Dallas with the gin-swilling Sue Ellen Ewing, replete with shoulder pads long before Dynasty, staggering around Southfork Ranch with a permanently tearful expression as she suffered the brunt of J.R. Ewing's evil ways?" [...] The Boulevard Magazine said, It may be 2009 and seventeen years since the primetime drama Dallas went off the air, but memories of the Ewing family still linger. Corruption and betrayal, lies, greed, affairs and scandal – all were just part of another day at the Southfork Ranch. At <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all was one of our favorite Ewings, the person we couldn't help but root for each week as she drank and slept her way through one ordeal after another. This, of course, was the tortured and (sometimes) villainous Sue Ellen Shepard Ewing, former Texas beauty queen and trophy wife of the womanizing rogue J.R. Ewing, played to perfection by actress Linda Gray.|$|E

[...] The channel's coverage featured numerous live performances from artists and bands on location.

2500|$|Developers John Dobler, John Fox, and John W. Van Hook {{purchased}} the 240-acre (97.2 hectare) {{area known as}} Anacostia from Enoch Tucker on June 5, 1854, for $19,000 and immediately subdivided the property into lots for houses. Fox had built a mansion on Jefferson Street (now W Street SE) some years before, and Fox and Van Hook were business partners in the Union Land Association. Naming the area Uniontown, the development became Washington's first [...] "suburban" [...] community. Van Hook (the lead developer) renamed streets in the area after former presidents: [...] Upper Marlborough Road was now called [...] "Harrison Street," [...] and Piscataway Road now known as [...] "Monroe Street". The area between Monroe Street and the Anacostia River {{was known as the}} Duvall subdivision, and Duvall's Tavern (a well-known bar) stood there. Half the lots sold within two months of the first sale. Restrictive covenants prohibited the sale or lease of property to anyone of African descent, Mulattoes, or Irish. The main street in the 17-block subdivision (bordered by Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE, Good Hope Road SE, 16th Street SE, and W Street SE) was 14th Street SE, which had a central market and a 40-foot (12.2 metre) wide boulevard running down <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Further to {{the east}} from Oudemans, Ius and Tithonium chasmata are located {{parallel}} to each other, Ius {{to the south and}} Tithonium to the north. [...] Ius is the wider of the two, leading to Melas Chasma. Ius has a ridge down <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> by the name of Geryon Montes, composed of the undivided basement rock. The floor of Ius Chasma is mostly composed of pristine landslide material, not much degraded by cratering or erosion. The southern wall of Ius, {{and to a lesser extent}} the northern wall, has many short valleys stretching off roughly perpendicular to the line of the chasmas. These valleys have a stubby theater-headed leading edge very much like features seen on the Colorado Plateau near the Grand Canyon that appear from groundwater sapping. (Theater-headed means that, from above, the head of the valley is a well-defined U-shape). The valley is propagated by the continued erosion and the collapse of the wall. Tithonium Chasma is very similar to Ius, except it is lacking the sapping features on the south side and contains a small portion of material that is similar to the smooth floor features except that it appears to be an ash fall that has been eroded by the wind. Between the two canyons, the surface is composed of younger fractured material - lava flows and faults from crustal extension of the Tharsis Bulge.|$|E
