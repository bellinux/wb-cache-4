In order {{to compensate for}} system drifts and attitude errors, the IPS utilizes a linearized Kalman filter (LKF) with precomputed gains. Since the a priori gains are generated for an expected system configuration, any system variations result in a suboptimal estimation process.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of the single linear hyperspectral pushbroom imaging based on a high altitude airship (HAA) without a <b>three-axis</b> stabilized <b>platform</b> {{is much more than}} that based on the spaceborne and airborne. Due to the effects of air pressure, temperature and airflow, the large pitch and roll angles tend to appear frequently that create pushbroom images highly characterized with severe geometric distortions. Thus, the in-flight calibration procedure is not appropriate to apply to the single linear pushbroom sensors on HAA having no <b>three-axis</b> stabilized <b>platform.</b> In order to address this problem, a new ground-based boresight calibration method is proposed. Firstly, a coordinate’s transformation model is developed for direct georeferencing (DG) of the linear imaging sensor, and then the linear error equation is derived from it by using the Taylor expansion formula. Secondly, the boresight misalignments are worked out by using iterative least squares method with few ground control points (GCPs) and ground-based side-scanning experiments. The proposed method is demonstrated by three sets of experiments: (i) the stability and reliability of the method is verified through simulation-based experiments; (ii) the boresight calibration is performed using ground-based experiments; and (iii) the validation is done by applying on the orthorectification of the real hyperspectral pushbroom images from a HAA Earth observation payload system developed by our research team—“LanTianHao”. The test results show that the proposed boresight calibration approach significantly improves the quality of georeferencing by reducing the geometric distortions caused by boresight misalignments to the minimum level...|$|R
40|$|Stable imaging of an {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry {{system is}} an important issue that affects the data processing and application of the system. Compared with traditional aerial images, the large rotation of roll, pitch, and yaw angles of UAV images decrease image quality and result in image deformation, thereby affecting the ground resolution, overlaps, and the consistency of the stereo models. These factors also cause difficulties in automatic tie point matching, image orientation, and accuracy of aerial triangulation (AT). The issues of large-angle photography of UAV photogrammetry system are discussed and analyzed quantitatively in this paper, and a simple and lightweight <b>three-axis</b> stabilization <b>platform</b> that works with a low-precision integrated inertial navigation system and a <b>three-axis</b> mechanical <b>platform</b> is used to reduce this problem. An experiment was carried out with an airship as the flight platform. Another experimental dataset, which was acquired by the same flight platform without a stabilization platform, was utilized for a comparative test. Experimental results show that the system can effectively isolate the swing of the flying platform. To ensure objective and reliable results, another group of experimental datasets, which were acquired using a fixed-wing UAV platform, was also analyzed. Statistical results of the experimental datasets confirm that stable imaging of a UAV platform can help improve the quality of aerial photography imagery and the accuracy of AT, and potentially improve the application of images acquired by a UAV...|$|R

40|$|A {{development}} {{procedure for}} a low-cost attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) with a self-developed <b>three-axis</b> rotating <b>platform</b> has been proposed. The AHRS consists of one 3 -axis accelerometer, three single-axis gyroscopes, and one 3 -axis digital compass. Both the accelerometer and gyroscope triads {{are based on}} micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS) technology, and the digital compass is based on anisotropic-magnetoresistive (AMR) technology. The calibrations for each sensor triad are readily accomplished by using the scalar calibration and the least squares methods. The platform is suitable for the calibration and validation of the low-cost AHRS and it is affordable for most laboratories. With the calibrated parameters and data fusion algorithm for the orientation estimation, the self-developed AHRS demonstrates the capabilities of compensating for the sensor errors and outputting the estimated orientation in real-time. The validation {{results show that the}} estimated orientations of the developed AHRS are within the acceptable region. This verifies the practicability of the proposed development procedure...|$|R
30|$|The IMA angular {{coverage}} {{is not only}} limited, it is potentially strongly biased as {{the orientation of the}} <b>three-axis</b> stabilized <b>platform</b> is determined by the needs of the on-board cameras and other instruments designed to study the surface and atmosphere of Mars. The orientation is therefore neither evenly nor randomly distributed. The directional sampling problem is further emphasized by the low energy ion data, below 50 eV, which does not have entrance deflection scanning and is thus two-dimensional. Things are further {{complicated by the fact that}} the space environment around Mars is not symmetric, it shows clear asymmetry relative to the direction of the solar wind electric field (Dubinin et al., 2006; Fedorov et al., 2006; Barabash et al., 2007; Nilsson et al., 2010). The crustal fields have a very uneven distribution between the hemispheres (Acuna et al., 1998; Connerney et al., 2001), which may also bias data if these are important for the ion distributions around Mars and the ion outflow.|$|R
40|$|A {{real-time}} estimation filter {{which reduces}} sensitivity to system variations {{and reduces the}} amount of preflight computation is developed for the instrument pointing subsystem (IPS). The IPS is a <b>three-axis</b> stabilized <b>platform</b> developed to point various astronomical observation instruments aboard the shuttle. Currently, the IPS utilizes a linearized Kalman filter (LKF), with premission defined gains, to compensate for system drifts and accumulated attitude errors. Since the a priori gains are generated for an expected system, variations result in a suboptimal estimation process. This report compares the performance of three real-time estimation filters with the current LKF implementation. An extended Kalman filter and a second-order Kalman filter are developed {{to account for the}} system nonlinearities, while a linear Kalman filter implementation assumes that the nonlinearities are negligible. The performance of each of the four estimation filters are compared with respect to accuracy, stability, settling time, robustness, and computational requirements. It is shown, that for the current IPS pointing requirements, the linear Kalman filter provides improved robustness over the LKF with less computational requirements than the two real-time nonlinear estimation filters...|$|R

At first, SoPC (system on a programmable chip) technology which is composed of an Altera FPGA (field programmable gate arrays) chip and an embedded soft-core Nios II processor is taken as {{the development of a}} multiaxis motion control IC. The multiaxis motion control IC has two modules. The first module is Nios II processor which realizes the motion trajectory planning by software.

40|$|Nowadays sun sensors {{are being}} more {{widely used in}} {{satellites}} to determine the sunray orientation, thus {{development of a new}} version of sun sensor with lighter mass, lower power consumption and smaller size it of considerable interest. This paper introduces such a novel digital sun sensor, which is composed of a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) mask with an N-shaped slit as well as a single linear array charge-coupled device (CCD). The sun sensor can achieve the measurement of two-axis sunray angles according to the three sun spot images on the CCD formed by sun light illumination through the mask. Given the CCD glass layer, an iterative algorithm is established to correct the refraction error. Thus, system resolution, update rate and other characteristics are improved based on the model simulation and system design. The test of sun sensor prototype is carried out on a <b>three-axis</b> rotating <b>platform</b> with a sun simulator. The test results show that the field of view (FOV) is ± 60 ° × ± 60 ° and the accuracy is 0. 08 degrees of arc (3 σ) in the whole FOV.

40|$|This article {{describes}} an adaptive fuzzy/proportion integration differentiation (PID) compound control scheme {{to promote the}} disturbance rejection ability of an aerial inertially stabilized platform. To deal with the serious influence of predominant unbalance torque disturbance on the steady precision of inertially stabilized platform, dynamic modeling and simulation analysis are conducted, which reveal that the unbalance torque disturbance is nonlinear and time varying. Then, an adaptive fuzzy/PID compound controller is designed that can automatically adjust and control parameters of the system in real time. In this way, the effects of unbalance torque disturbance on control performance are suppressed greatly so that the pointing accuracy and stability are obviously improved.

40|$|A 100 kg class SSTL {{microsatellite}} platform accommodating the Sira Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) {{can perform}} high spectral resolution imaging over multiple wavelengths. Hyperspectral imaging data {{may be used}} within {{a wide variety of}} applications ranging from precision agriculture and land use, to ocean colour monitoring, coastal and atmospheric studies. CHRIS operates in the 415 to 1050 nm wavelength band, with spectral sampling interval from 2 to 12 nm (depending on wavelength) and is programmable from the ground. Operating at 25 m ground sample distance the instrument can provide information over 19 spectral bands whilst at 50 m ground sample distance, for example, 63 bands can be imaged simultaneously. Flying CHRIS as the main payload on a SSTL microsatellite enables dedicated platform resources to exploit the huge potential of such a payload at low cost. The <b>three-axis</b> stabilised <b>platform</b> can off-point from nadir by ± 30 ° to support accurate target selection. 48 Mbps payload data downlink rates, a 12 Gbyte data storage, and high efficiency GaAs panels for power provision all ensure a good payload duty cycle per orbit.

40|$|Background: Modern micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) {{technologies}} {{provides the}} moderate-cost and miniaturized {{solutions for the}} development of attitude reference system. Using highly­ integrated inertial measurement units (IMUs) provided by ADI Company, a mini attitude reference system was developed for precise agricultural control and autonomous vehicle. Methods: The attitude reference system is composed of an ARM processor (STM 32 F 446 RC) and ADIS 16445 iSensor® which includes triaxial gyroscopes and triaxial accelerometers. The raw sensors data was sampled by STM 32 F 446 RC processor through SPI interface. A second order autoregressive (AR) model was developed to model the random draft error of MEMS gyroscopes. By using extended kalman filter (EKF), the sensor fusion algorithm was implemented for the attitude reference system. The AR model was incorporated into the EKF algorithm and the measurement noise covariance was estimated from the AR model, which limited the fine tuning of noise covariance to the process noise covariance only. To verify the performance of the gyroscopes, accelerometers, and the attitude reference system, the tests were carried out on SGT 320 E <b>three-axis</b> turntable <b>platform</b> and LOVOL TD 904 tractor. Results: Test results showed that the robust performance of gyroscopes and accelerometers could be obtained with stable supply voltage. Typical accuracy of attitude reference system in static was 0. 03 degree with max error 0. 1 degree, and the typical dynamic accuracy was 0. 7 degree with max error 1 degree. The developed mini attitude reference system had good performance on tractor navigation, so as to autonomous vehicle. Discussions: Environment temperature will affect the performance of micro-electromechanical devices and the zero bias of gyroscopes and accelerometers, which will need to estimate when applying extended kalman filter. Conclusion: This paper developed a mini attitude reference system with stable performance and high precision which was suitable to applied in precise agricultural machines and its implements...|$|R
40|$|It is {{relatively}} straight-forward to derive comprehensive dynamics block diagrams for two- and <b>three-axis</b> balanced stabilized <b>platforms.</b> But {{trying to do}} it for four and higher order systems is getting rapidly such an amount of work, and the resulting block diagrams so extensive, that sensible simplification from the start if feasible could be very beneficial. Those terms {{that are going to be}} insignificantly small relative to the other terms should be left out right from the start when deriving the equations. In this paper a method is shown to simplify the dynamics model of stabilized platforms, with the four-axis platform as the main example. The relevant equations are derived for the four-axis example, the block diagram is compiled from the equations after adding simple control loops around the dynamics model to get to the final expanded block diagram, and then some simulation results are shown. The method is validated by showing that the simulation results for a three-axis system are exactly the same for the comprehensive and simplified block diagrams, using the same method. It is proposed that it is therefore reasonable to expect similar findings for the four-axis case...|$|R
40|$|Attitude {{estimation}} {{is often}} more difficult for spinning spacecraft than for <b>three-axis</b> stabilized <b>platforms</b> due {{to the need to}} follow rapidly-varying state vector elements and the lack of three-axis rate measurements from gyros. The estimation problem simplifies when torques are negligible and nutation has damped out, but the general case requires a sequential filter with dynamics propagation. This paper describes the implementation and test results for an extended Kalman filter for spinning spacecraft attitude and rate estimation based on a novel set of variables suggested in a paper by Markley [AAS 93 - 3301 (referred to hereafter as Markley variables). Markley has demonstrated that the new set of variables provides a superior parameterization for numerical integration of the attitude dynamics for spinning or momentum-biased spacecraft. The advantage is that the Markley variables have fewer rapidly-varying elements than other representations such as the attitude quaternion and rate vector. A filter based on these variables was expected to show improved performance due to the more accurate numerical state propagation. However, for a variety of test cases, it has been found that the new filter, as currently implemented, does not perform significantly better than a quaternion-based filter that was developed and tested in parallel. This paper reviews the mathematical background for a filter based on Markley variables. It also describes some features of the implementation and presents test results. The test cases are based on a mission using magnetometer and Sun sensor data and gyro measurements on two axes normal to the spin axis. The orbit and attitude scenarios and spacecraft parameters are modeled after one of the THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms) probes. Several tests are presented that demonstrate the filter accuracy and convergence properties. The tests include torque-free motion with various nutation angles, large constant-torque attitude slews, sensor misalignments, large initial attitude and rate errors, and cases with low data frequency. It is found that the convergence is rapid, the radius of convergence is large, and the results are reasonably accurate even in the presence of unmodeled perturbations...|$|R
30|$|The {{intrinsic}} field-of-view of IMA is 4.5 ° × 360 ° in {{the spacecraft}} X–Z plane, divided into 16 azimuthal sectors of 22.5 ° (see Barabash and the ASPERA- 3 team, 2006) their figure 37 or Nilsson et al. (2006 a) their figure 1 for a schematic {{description of the}} IMA field-of-view {{as well as a}} definition of the spacecraft coordinate system). Mars Express is a <b>three-axis</b> stabilized instrument <b>platform.</b> In order to obtain a limited three-dimensional field-of-view IMA utilizes an electrostatic entrance deflection system to bring particles in from about ± 45 ° from the viewing plane of the instrument. The entrance deflection is stepped through 16 different elevation angles with an angular spacing close to 5.625 ° to obtain a total angular coverage of 90 ° out of the instrument viewing plane. Part of the three-dimensional field-of-view is blocked by the spacecraft body and the solar panels. Throughout our work we use only data from viewing directions which are not affected by spacecraft blocking. We use a conservative approximation of the blocking due to the moveable solar panels, rather removing too much than too little data. At energies below 50 eV the entrance deflection system has insufficient resolution to obtain the desired angles of deflection, and therefore the entrance deflection system is set to a value as close to zero deflection as possible. This means that below 50 eV the measurements are two-dimensional.|$|R
