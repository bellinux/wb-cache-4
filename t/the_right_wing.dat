5|$|Guiscard, however, {{had been}} {{informed}} of Alexios' arrival by his scouts {{and on the}} night of October 17, he moved his army from the peninsula to the mainland. Upon learning of Guiscard's move, Alexios revised his battle plan. He split his army into three divisions, with the left wing under the command of Gregory Pakourianos, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> under the command of Nikephoros Melissenos, and himself in command of the centre. Guiscard formed his battle line opposite Alexios's, with <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> under the command of the Count of Giovinazzo, the left under Bohemond and Guiscard facing Alexios in the centre.|$|E
5|$|The Allies seem to {{have formed}} into two wings; on the right were the Athenians, Corinthians, Sicyonians and Troezenians, and on the left were the Spartans with other contingents. <b>The</b> <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> marched across level ground {{straight}} towards the Persian camp, whilst the left wing attempted to outflank the Persians by passing through more broken ground. <b>The</b> <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> thus began fighting with the Persians while the left wing was still approaching. Herodotus reports that the Persians fought well at first, but that the Athenians and the contingents with them wished to win the victory before the Spartans arrived, and thus attacked ever more zealously.|$|E

He {{had at least}} 2,000 horse from Yorkshire and Lancashire, deployed in nine divisions, with 600 musketeers posted between {{them in the same}} manner as on the left wing. There were also perhaps 500 dragoons. One regiment of Covenanter horse {{commanded by}} the Earl of Eglinton was deployed with Fairfax's front line, two more (one of them composed of lancers commanded by the Earl of Balgonie, Leven's son) were deployed behind Fairfax's second line.

50|$|Mongolia {{was once}} again unified under queen Mandukhai the Wise and Batmönkh Dayan Khan, who subdued the Taishis. Queen Manduhai {{defeated}} the Oirats when Batmönkh was still a child. Later Batmönkh subdued the Taishis of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>wings</b> as they refused to accept a suzereign over them—son of Dayan Khan sent there as a Jinong. After this event, Batmönkh moved his residence from Khalkha to Chaharia, to a proxime neighbourhood to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>wings</b> for tighter control over them. Since then, the Mongol Khans resided in Chaharia up to 1634. The left-wing tumens under Dayan Khan were Khalkha, Chaharia and Urianhai, and the right-wing tumens were Ordos/Tümed, Yunshiyebu and Kharchin/Khorchin.|$|R

With about five minutes remaining, a long-range shot from Bobby Murdoch was diverted by Stevie Chalmers past a wrong-footed Sarti. This {{proved to be the}} winning goal.|$|E
5|$|Although the Persians stood {{their ground}} for a while, they {{eventually}} broke and fled to the palisade. The soldiers of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> followed them into the camp, at which point many of the Persian army fled from the camp, except the ethnic Persian troops, who grouped together and fought the Allied soldiers who entered the camp. Finally, the left wing arrived, outflanking the camp and falling on {{the rear of the}} remaining Persian forces, thereby completing the rout.|$|E

5|$|In the 2012–13 season, Robben {{had started}} the season on the bench, as manager Jupp Heynckes {{preferred}} to start Thomas Müller on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>wing,</b> with Toni Kroos at the attacking midfielder position. Robben had played through the season as a substitute, but earned his chance to start again after Kroos was injured during the Champions League tie against Juventus. He started on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> {{for the rest of}} the season, having moved Müller back to the middle. Robben started against Borussia Dortmund in the quarter-finals of the DFB-Pokal and scored the game's lone goal in the 43rd minute. In the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona, Robben started both games and scored in both games, including the go-ahead goal in the second leg. Bayern would then go on to return to the final. Robben atoned for his penalty miss the previous season by setting up teammate Mario Mandžukić's goal to open the scoring in the 60th minute then netting an 89th-minute winner in a 2–1 victory over Borussia Dortmund to give Bayern their fifth Champions League/European Cup title. During the presentation, he was named Man of the Match by UEFA.|$|E
