5|$|Diving beetles, {{such as the}} Dytiscidae, carry {{a bubble}} of air {{with them when they}} dive. Such a bubble may be {{contained}} under the elytra or against the body by specialized hydrophobic hairs. <b>The</b> <b>bubble</b> covers {{at least some of the}} spiracles, permitting air to enter the tracheae. The function of <b>the</b> <b>bubble</b> is not only to contain a store of air, but to act as a physical gill. The air that it traps is in contact with oxygenated water, so as the animal's consumption depletes the oxygen in <b>the</b> <b>bubble,</b> more oxygen can diffuse in to replenish it. Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water than either oxygen or nitrogen, so it readily diffuses out faster than in. Nitrogen is the most plentiful gas in <b>the</b> <b>bubble,</b> and the least soluble, so it constitutes a relatively static component of <b>the</b> <b>bubble</b> and acts as a stable medium for respiratory gases to accumulate in and pass through. Occasional visits to the surface are sufficient for the beetle to re-establish the constitution of <b>the</b> <b>bubble.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective.

40|$|We present {{three-dimensional}} hydrodynamical {{simulations of}} buoyant gas {{in a typical}} cluster environment.

40|$|The optical {{microscope}} revealed that when air-saturated dilute aqueous uspensions of coarse kaolinite and dickite crystals were evacuated, negatively charged bubbles formed on {{and between the}} particles, which showed characteristic spatial relations to <b>the</b> <b>bubbles</b> and to each other.

40|$|In this study, {{we treat}} <b>the</b> Fermi <b>bubbles</b> as a scaled-up version of {{supernova}} remnants (SNRs). <b>The</b> <b>bubbles</b> are created through {{activities of the}} super-massive black hole (SMBH) or starbursts at the Galactic center (GC). Cosmic-rays (CRs) are accelerated at the forward shocks of <b>the</b> <b>bubbles</b> like SNRs, which means that we cannot decide whether <b>the</b> <b>bubbles</b> were created by the SMBH or starbursts from the radiation from the CRs. We follow the evolution of CR distribution by solving a diffusion-advection equation, considering {{the reduction of the}} diffusion coefficient by CR streaming. In this model, gamma-rays are created through hadronic interaction between CR protons and the gas in the Galactic halo. In the GeV band, we can well reproduce the observed flat distribution of gamma-ray surface brightness, because some amount of gas is left behind the shock. The edge of <b>the</b> <b>bubbles</b> is fairly sharp owing to the high gas density behind the shock and the reduction of the diffusion coefficient there. The latter also contributes the hard gamma-ray spectrum of <b>the</b> <b>bubbles.</b> We find that the CR acceleration at the shock has started when <b>the</b> <b>bubbles</b> were small, and the time-scale of the energy injection at the GC was much smaller than the age of <b>the</b> <b>bubbles.</b> We predict that if CRs are accelerated to the TeV regime, <b>the</b> apparent <b>bubble</b> size should be larger in the TeV band, which could be used to discriminate our hadronic model from other leptonic models.
