The Capital District has many museums, historical sites, art galleries, and festivals that stretch back to the 17th century. The Capital District has been pivotal {{in the history of}} Santa Claus in the United States including the first written reference to Santa (Sinterclaas) in 1675 and the first publishing of 'Twas <b>the</b> <b>Night</b> <b>before</b> <b>Christmas</b> in 1823.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, Starewicz {{moved to}} Moscow and began {{work with the}} film company of Aleksandr Khanzhonkov. There he made two dozen films, most of them puppet {{animations}} using dead animals. Of these, The Beautiful Leukanida (premiere - 1912), first puppet film with a plot inspired {{in the story of}} Agamenon and Menelas, earned international acclaim (one British reviewer was tricked into thinking the stars were live trained insects), while The Grasshopper and the Ant (1911) got Starewicz decorated by the czar. But the best-known film of this period, was Mest' kinematograficheskogo operatora (Revenge of the Kinematograph Cameraman, aka The Cameraman's Revenge) (1912), a cynical work about infidelity and jealousy among the insects. Some of the films made for Khanzhonkov feature live-action/animation interaction. In some cases, the live action consisted of footage of Starewicz's daughter Irina. Particularly worthy of note is Starevich's 41-minute 1913 film <b>The</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Before</b> <b>Christmas,</b> an adaptation of the Nikolai Gogol story of the same name. The 1913 film Terrible Vengeance won the Gold Medal at an international festival in Milan in 1914, being just one of five films which won awards among 1005 contestants.|$|E

500|$|Serbian ethnologist Petar Vlahović has {{proposed}} that the noun badnjak and the related adjective badnji (attributive [...] "Christmas Eve") are derived from {{the root of the}} verb bdeti ("to be awake"), referring to a custom of staying awake through <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>Christmas</b> Day.

50|$|Blue Christmas, {{also called}} <b>the</b> Longest <b>Night</b> in <b>the</b> Western Christian tradition, {{is a day}} in the Advent season marking <b>the</b> longest <b>night</b> of <b>the</b> year. On this day, some churches hold a church service that honours people who have lost loved ones in that year. The Holy Eucharist is {{traditionally}} a part of the service of worship on this day. Some churches hold a service of worship on <b>the</b> longest <b>night</b> of <b>the</b> year, which falls on or about December 21st, the Winter Solstice. There is an interesting convergence for this day as it is also the traditional feast day for Saint Thomas the Apostle. This linkage invites making some connections between Thomas's struggle to believe the tale of Jesus' resurrection, <b>the</b> long <b>nights</b> just <b>before</b> <b>Christmas,</b> and <b>the</b> struggle with darkness and grief faced by those living with loss.|$|R

2500|$|The episode, {{directed}} by South Park animation director Eric Stough, {{has a unique}} look compared to most other episodes of the series. The creators wanted a different design for Pip's England featured in the episode. For example, the directions for the exterior scenes were {{to make them look}} like they are [...] "right out of a Dickens novel". To achieve the style, a lot of assets had to be built from scratch, including many new characters with [...] "new mouths with rotted out teeth" [...] that were used for most of them. At the beginning of the episode, Pip is dressed in more ragged clothing than he usually wears in South Park. Later, when he becomes a gentleman in London, he is wearing his usual South Park attire, including his bow tie. The character of Pocket is designed to look similar to the children in the 1974 Rankin/Bass animated Christmas television special 'Twas <b>the</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Before</b> <b>Christmas.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>Christmas</b> Eve I heard a {{burst of}} musical voices so close that {{they might as well}} have been inside the house instead of just outside; so I asked them inside, hoping that they might then seem farther away.

I will not describe it; it is indescribable; but I will describe my parallel sentiments as it passed.|$|E
