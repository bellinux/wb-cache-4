This paper uses a CGE model to {{evaluate}} {{the impact of the}} SADC FTA on Madagascar economy. The results suggest that the SADC FTA would only have a limited impact on Madagascar''s real GDP because the liberalization affects only a small share of its total imports. However, Madagascar''s <b>trade</b> and production pattern would change and benefit the textile and clothing sector. Removing rigidities in the labor and capital market would increase the gains but they would remain limited. Gains from the SADC FTA become substantial only when the regional liberalization is accompanied by a multilateral liberalization. <b>Trade</b> policy;Southern African Development Community;Economic models;trade liberalization, <b>trade</b> diversion, terms of <b>trade,</b> regional <b>trade,</b> multilateral liberalization, export prices, regional integration, import prices, unskilled labor, <b>trade</b> agreements, <b>trade</b> flows, regional <b>trade</b> agreements, international <b>trade,</b> skilled labor, <b>trade</b> creation, world prices, <b>trade</b> creating, global <b>trade</b> analysis, global <b>trade,</b> average tariff, export taxes, <b>trade</b> integration, regional liberalization, tariff cut, export markets, export processing zones, preferential access, dynamic gains, total exports, domestic investment, tariff reduction, terms of <b>trade</b> effects, domestic production, volume of <b>trade,</b> tariff structure, world price, tariff cuts, export volume, export tax, tariff rate, <b>trade</b> policies, <b>trade</b> effects, export processing, net exports, preferential <b>trade</b> agreements, <b>trade</b> expansion, <b>trade</b> reform, regional <b>trade</b> liberalization, world economy, <b>trade</b> openness, partner countries, regional <b>trade</b> integration, food exports, unilateral <b>trade,</b> mfn tariffs, multilateral <b>trade,</b> tariff distortions, exporters, tariff reductions, preferential <b>trade,</b> import-substitution policies, <b>trade</b> pattern, full liberalization, quantitative restrictions, <b>trade</b> regimes, equilibrium model, preferential treatment, domestic goods, quota-free access, tariff lines, free <b>trade,</b> duty-free treatment, country of origin, preferential agreement, international <b>trade</b> agreements, multilateral reduction, area <b>trade,</b> multilateral <b>trade</b> liberalization, applied tariff, economic integration, share of exports, equilibrium assessments, elasticity of substitution, <b>trade</b> preferences, regional <b>trade</b> arrangements, common market, net <b>trade</b> creation, global welfare, transition period, <b>trade</b> regime, industry <b>trade,</b> bilateral <b>trade</b> flows, import tariffs, dynamic effects, <b>trade</b> agreement, international <b>trade</b> policies, changes in <b>trade,</b> <b>trade</b> arrangements, <b>trade</b> area, world <b>trade,</b> expansion of exports, political integration, nondiscriminatory liberalization, <b>trade</b> policy reform, pattern of <b>trade,</b> liberalizing <b>trade,</b> constant elasticity of substitution, <b>trade</b> changes, investment goods, <b>trade</b> structure, bilateral <b>trade,</b> duty-free access, <b>trade</b> protocol, rules of origin, free <b>trade</b> area, <b>trade</b> patterns, liberalization of <b>trade,</b> fostering <b>trade...</b>|$|R

In addition, key measures for improving compliance with the requirements for a customs union need to be introduced, including limiting tariff exemptions, phasing out remaining surcharges, strengthening the determination of products'' country origin, and enhancing customs administration. There is also a need to improve transportation infrastructure and organization.
