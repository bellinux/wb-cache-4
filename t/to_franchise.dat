500|$|The Sanders Court & Café {{generally}} served travelers, so {{when the}} route planned in 1955 for Interstate 75 bypassed Corbin, Sanders sold his properties and traveled the US <b>to</b> <b>franchise</b> his chicken recipe to restaurant owners.

A Heublein spokesman described it as a [...] "nuisance suit".

500|$|In 1976, Bakshi pitched War Wizards to 20th Century Fox. Returning to {{the fantasy}} {{drawings}} {{he had created}} in high school for inspiration, Bakshi intended {{to prove that he}} could produce a [...] "family picture" [...] that had the same impact as his adult-oriented films. British illustrator Ian Miller and comic book artist Mike Ploog were hired to contribute backgrounds and designs. The crew included Vita, Turek, Sparey, Vitello and Spence, who had become comfortable with Bakshi's limited storyboarding and lack of pencil tests. As the production costs increased, Fox president Alan Ladd, Jr. declined Bakshi's requests for salary increases, and refused to give him $50,000 to complete the film. At the same time, Ladd was dealing with similar budget problems on George Lucas's Star Wars. Bakshi and Lucas had negotiated contracts entitling them <b>to</b> <b>franchise</b> ownership, merchandising and back-end payment, so Ladd suggested that they fund the completion of their films themselves.|$|E

Although Janet Maslin of The New York Times admitted the film's plot was [...] "demented", she wrote that the film [...] "has done {{a great deal to}} ensure the series' longevity". Rushworth Kidder of the Christian Science Monitor praised the film for giving audiences a view of their modern life from a different perspective, while simultaneously proving that a film does not need to have murder, violence, innuendo or even a main villain for dramatic storytelling.|$|E

40|$|Residential remodelling {{contractors}} {{operate in}} a highly fragmented, disaggregated market. Competition and consolidation arise from other market actors, thus remodellers have diminished bargaining power and higher market risk since they traditionally service geographically specific markets. Franchising theories may provide a competitive business strategy to parallel consolidation in other actors. Yet a small population of remodelling franchises {{are listed in the}} US. The vast majority of these franchises were in specialty trades and only one general contracting franchise was represented. This raises the question as to what extent there are barriers <b>to</b> <b>franchising</b> in practice for general contractors in the US remodelling industry and whether opportunities exist for growth through franchising. First, economic theories of franchising are evaluated against secondary quantitative data and extant literature. Second, interviews were conducted among non-franchising, general remodellers. Two principal findings emerge. Human capital requirements are found to be a primary barrier <b>to</b> <b>franchising.</b> A second finding is the perceptual barrier among key decision-makers in founder-controlled firms. Therefore, the barriers are largely perceptual. The finding is reflected upon by introducing upper-echelon theory and ultimately suggests that as the profiles of company owners change, the perceptual barrier <b>to</b> <b>franchising</b> may be of lesser significance. Barriers <b>to</b> entry, <b>franchising,</b> general contractor, remodelling,...|$|R

Towards {{the end of the}} 2012–13 season, he received the opportunity to break through <b>to</b> <b>franchise</b> level, playing five matches for the Knights franchise in the Momentum 1 Day Cup. This arose due to an injury to Morne van Wyk, the normal wicket-keeper. At the time, Triegaardt was described by the franchise coach, Sarel Cilliers, as having been selected as [...] "the best gloveman available", despite poor form with the bat. Outside of playing the sport, Triegaardt gained a level-three coaching qualification from Cricket South Africa, and became involved with Griqualand West's academy. In July 2013, he was appointed to replace Wendell Bossenger as Griqualand West's head coach, and consequently retired from playing. Despite playing over 60 matches across the three formats, Triegaardt finished his playing career without ever recording a half-century, a rarity for a modern wicket-keeper. His highest score was 49 not out, which came against Eastern Province in March 2012, and was made from ninth in the batting order.|$|E
