40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} Australia’s {{national security}} interests in the South China Sea. It notes {{that a number of}} states lay claim to various islands in the region, and that territorial disputes over those claims have occasionally erupted into armed conflict in the past. The paper contends that China’s more recent behaviour in asserting its claim is unsettling the region and heightening strategic competition between China and the US, particularly regarding freedom of navigation through the South China Sea. The paper explores two key interests: first, the maintenance of a rules-based international order, especial ly in a contested and strategically-located area so close to Australia’s diplomatic, economic and military interests; and second, in ensuring continued and free access to the ‘global commons’. It concludes that Australia has real and <b>tangible</b> national <b>security</b> interests in the South China Sea that will become increasingly significant across the next decade, not least because Australia’s interests are closely aligned with those of the US, which potentially could involve aiding the US in the event of conflict...|$|R

To fill these gaps, we introduce a new tool, called SD Elements, which focuses on prevention of vulnerabilities as opposed to detection. SD Elements is a centralized security knowledge base that covers different development life cycle phases, so security {{is built into the}} application from the early phases of the life cycle. Users are able to specify technologies, platforms, requirements, and programming languages, and SD Elements tailor security guidelines for different projects according to the user specifications.

It has large capacity, high safety level, and free from traffic jam. Those characteristics make railway a primary public transportation. In  fact, even railway transportation {{has a lot of}} benefits for society life but they still faced by the problem. Service quality level of Railways transportation is still low compared with other transportation modes. At present railways operation is still colored with the delay, limited condition vehicle, and unclear train travel information that often disadvantage passengers, and many other services offered fail to attract passengers. These conditions result in decreasing the quality of services and insufficient railways operation. The objective of this research is to analyze the relationship between customer satisfaction towards provided service with the desire to do a complaint and to find the factor from service quality that has significant influences to customer satisfaction towards PT KAI services. From that data, and also comparison study between PT Kereta Api Indonesia and Statens Järnvägar (SJ) AB, Sweden, we can recommend the service standards design, service guarantee and complaint handling system that need to be adjusted with the interest of consumer. The data was collected via field survey in the station that located in Jakarta, Yogyakarta and Pekalongan. This research shows several findings. First, there are six factors of service quality attributes that have significant influences to customer satisfaction towards PT KAI services for commuter class (Information, Appearances, Service coverage, <b>Tangible,</b> Safety & <b>security,</b> and Cost), seven factors for business class (Travel time, Information, Scheduling, Comfort, <b>Tangible,</b> Safety & <b>security,</b> and Service coverage), and also seven factor for executive class (Appearances, Safety & <b>security,</b> Information, Comfort, <b>Tangible,</b> Travel time, and Cost). Second, while the commuter class passengers complain on the Safety & security attribute, for business class it is the information that influence the desire to complain. Meanwhile for executive class, passengers are mostly satisfied with the service given by PT KAI. Third, to decrease the number of complaints, some effective mechanisms to handle those complaints and learning from Statens Järnvägar (SJ) AB are necessary to take. Fourth, the service standards for PT KAI can be classified into 6 details of service, (safety and security attributes; comfort and appearances attributes; availability of information aspect attributes; tangible attributes; service coverage attributes; and the operations of train). For service guarantee design, this research focus on travel time guarantee. Learning from Statens Järnvägar (SJ) AB on Sweden service guarantee, PT KAI can adopt and use their system to increase customer satisfaction...|$|R

The intention is to offer all parties better support for trust (as reputation) management including the reduction of risk and improved reliability of VO e-services. A novel trust agent is proposed that seeks to provide an e-service consumer with an objective measure of the trustworthiness of the e-service at run-time, just prior to its actual consumption. Specifically, VO e-service consumer confidence level is informed, by leveraging third party objective evidence. This comprises a set of Corporate Governance (CG) scores.

A sizeable proportion of such loans required the deposit of no <b>tangible</b> <b>security</b> although over time this proportion declined. There were important differences in terms of collateral requirements demanded of private partnerships and limited companies, with the latter having to provide additional security to cover their limited liability status. In terms of the degree of bank involvement in the finance of industry a significant finding is that the commercial banks did lend to finance industrial fixed capital investment and, though most loans were short-term, about one-fifth were lent for two or more years through the rolling-over of short period loans. ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis investigates the ties between biometrics and state security by analyzing biometric identification and screening programs, their structural elements, and ultimately their effectiveness. Although biometric identification is rapidly becoming an international norm, quantitative assessments of biometric identification programs {{within the larger}} context of state and international security are non-existent. This thesis discusses the idea of identity, defines the identity problem, addresses identity's role in state security, and addresses how biometric identification contributes to this end. Individual characteristics of the most prominently used biometric identifiers are discussed in detail (face, fingerprint, and iris), as well as the overall concept of biometric identification. The ICAO e-Passport program and the U. S. specific screening functions are presented to illuminate how biometric identifiers are used in practical applications. These programs, in turn, {{serve as the basis for}} the investigation of the effectiveness of biometric identification as it pertains to state security, focusing first on U.

This research developed a survey instrument to help a practicing administrator determine how a local school is performing in the area of customer service. Ten dimensions of Total Quality Service were used as a basis to determine what parents felt were the most important issues of customer service in a public school. The 10 dimensions are <b>tangibles,</b> courtesy, <b>security,</b> access, communication, reliability, responsiveness, credibility, competence, and understanding the customer. Parent focus groups from three different suburban elementary schools were conducted to develop a list of items that parents thought were important to them in the area of customer service. Parents were asked the question, "What do you as a parent expect from the school as it relates to [...] . " The 10 dimensions of Total Quality Service were then discussed one at a time. Seventy common items were generated from the four focus groups and the same parent participants were used to conduct a modified Q-Sort procedure. Parents were forced to rate an exact number of items with a certain rating, using a 5 to 1 Likert Scale with 5 being absolutely critical and 1 being least important. This established a numerical ranking of all 70 items. The top 40 scoring items from the Q-Sort procedure were used to develop the final survey instrument. Demographic data were obtained for each focus group and later combined as one total group. The data supplied from the responses provided a description of the sample population used to develop the information that created the survey items. The final survey instrument was developed to measure two different aspects of parent perceptions of customer service. The first measures satisfaction: how the local school is performing in relation to the identified item. The second measures importance: how important the parents feel the specific item is in relation to their personal customer satisfaction. Practicing administrators can use this information to start a school improvement process by comparing the importance score to the satisfaction score. A low-satisfaction score on a high-importance item would warrant a detailed investigation...|$|R

Unfortunately, web applications are also frequently targeted by attackers, and criticial vulnerabilities such as XSS and SQL injection are still common. As a consequence, much effort in the past decade has been spent on mitigating web application vulnerabilities. Current techniques focus mainly on sanitization: either on automated sanitization, the detection of missing sanitizers, the correctness of sanitizers, or the correct placement of sanitizers. However, these techniques are either not able to prevent new forms of input validation vulnerabilities such as HTTP Parameter Pollution, come with large runtime overhead, lack precision, or require significant modifications to the client and/or server infrastructure. In this paper, we present IPAAS, a novel technique for preventing the exploitation of XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities based on automated data type detection of input parameters. IPAAS automatically and transparently augments otherwise insecure web application development environments with input validators that result in significant and <b>tangible</b> <b>security</b> improvements for real systems. We implemented IPAAS for PHP and evaluated it on five real-world web applications with known XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities. Our evaluation demonstrates that IPAAS would have prevented 83 % of SQL injection vulnerabilities and 65 % of XSS vulnerabilities while incurring no developer burden. I...|$|E

The Global ATM Security Management project (GAMMA) addresses the development of such a security situation management capability. Following the September 11 attacks and major large-scale outages of critical infrastructures, the security of air navigation has emerged as a critical capability gap. On-going transformation programs like SESAR and NextGen are moving into the deployment phase with limited to none <b>tangible</b> <b>security</b> solutions. GAMMA addresses this gap by investigating a security situation management capability. The framework of this capability is devised as a distributed network of aviation stakeholders that jointly collaborate in identifying and localizing security incidents while considering the constraints given by the different participants, national responsibilities, and collaboration-related requirements. This paper addresses the preparatory work for the validation of an initial security situation management capability. For that purpose, project partners setup a joint configuration and trial network for the security functions and systems developed in the frame of a real-time human-in-the-loop simulation. The simulation results have been measured against the mapping of the operational concept and validation requirements, in particular in terms of situational awareness on the operator side and networked incident management response. These results will inform the further validation activities of the project...|$|E

This study aimed to assess the service quality of teaching hospitals of Yazd University of Medical Sciences using Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). MethodsA literature review and a qualitative method were used to obtain experts' viewpoints about the quality dimensions of hospital services to design a questionnaire. Then, using a self-made questionnaire, perceptions of 300 patients {{about the quality of}} delivered services were gathered. Finally, FAHP was applied to weigh each quality dimension and TOPSIS method to rank hospital wards. ResultsSix dimensions including responsiveness, assurance, <b>security,</b> <b>tangibles,</b> health communication and Patient orientation were identified as affecting aspects of hospital services quality among which, <b>security</b> and <b>tangibles</b> got the highest and lowest importance respectively (0. 25406, 0. 06883).

Retailers are trying to differentiate the 'package' offer, build customer loyalty and make their position through the provision of high service quality. In addition, the services provided can be varied, such as exterior and interior design of retail stores, preparation of goods for sale, appearance and behavior of sales personnel, culture of communication with customers, and services provided after the sales process. Consumers require the service quality when making purchasing decision. For retail companies and retail stores {{it is important to}} continuously monitor the level of service quality. In order to measure the service quality, the method that found its application in the theory and practice is SERVQUAL. This model was created as a combination of theoretical and practical research and it looks at the quality of service as the content of the following dimensions: <b>tangibles,</b> reliability, sensitivity, <b>security</b> and empathy. As such, it {{is a function of the}} difference between perceptions and expectations (Q = P-E) and is widely accepted to measure the service quality in traditional retail stores, public sector, higher education, real estate, hospitals, courts and so on.

However, {{there is a lack}} of research in this area and relevant, scientifically justifiable studies should assist in determining what is required for the provision of good quality service to students. The purpose of this study was to determine the difference between the expectations of service and the perceptions of actual service provided by the Human Resources Department at the University of Pretoria. The respondent group included students from a variety of disciplines who chose Industrial and Organisational Psychology as subject. Based on the survey method a questionnaire was used to gather the relevant information. The literature study identified five important dimensions of customer service namely <b>tangibles,</b> reliability, responsibility, <b>security</b> and empathy. The expectations and perceptions of the students (n= 255) of actual service in terms of the above dimensions were determined and weighed against each other. The results of this study showed that although there is room for improvement, the level of customer service provided by the department was proven to be satisfactory. The following conclusions were made regarding the perceptions of the research group in terms of current and expected levels of service. Aspects that appeared to be most satisfactory, were appearance of employees, reliability of lecturers, safety of interaction, time spent with students and keeping of accurate records. There is room for improvement in the following areas: spending time with individuals, current working and consulting hours, efficiency of available facilities and attention given to students' needs. Field of study, age, language, residence, academic and historical year did not have any effect worth mentioning on the perceptions of current levels of service. Biographical variables did have an impact on the expectations of levels of service. Thesis (MCom) [...] University of Pretoria, 2004. Human Resource Managementunrestricte...|$|R
40|$|Daily life is {{increasingly}} penetrated by new technologies. Advanced driver assistance systems with sophisticated sensors are increasingly available in all classes of vehicles. Moreover, mobile devices, such as smartphones, have become our daily companions. With {{the help of}} wireless communication technologies, our society and mobility have become increasingly connected. Based on these technologies, industry and academia have developed applications within the automotive field to provide customers with improved traffic efficiency, infotainment features and driver assistance. Vehicle-related crime as well as fear of vehicle-related crime are omnipresent in our society. They result in personal injury, economic losses and reduced quality of life. Vehicle-related crime is a worldwide problem beyond national borders. Since criminals usually adjust their skills to overcome countermeasures, continuous development towards more innovative secu- rity measures is necessary to counteract them. Until now, existing countermeasures dealing with vehicle-related crime are mostly concentrated on the vehicle itself and focus on physical target hardening. Neither occupants, infrastructure nor other vehicles are involved to counter- act vehicle-related crime collaboratively. To close this gap, we focus on automotive security functions. These functions make use of new technical capabilities of modern vehicles and consumer electronics to tackle vehicle-related crime, decrease fear of crime and provide tangibility of security to customers. In this thesis, {{we focus on the}} identification of potential security functions in a structured way and the pre-emptive evaluation of security functions, i. e., estimating the (expected) effective- ness before a security function is entirely developed and deployed. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: •We propose a definition of automotive security functions and vehicle-related crime to establish a fourth class of applications besides infotainment, traffic efficiency and assis- tance applications. •We analyze statistical crime data from several countries as well as data from existing victimization surveys to gain a deeper understanding of vehicle-related crime. Addi- tionally, we conduct a victimization survey in Germany, the USA and Mexico to gain further insights into (fear of) vehicle-related crime. Making use of the same methodol- ogy in all three countries, we are able to compare findings across these countries. •We propose a methodology which uses both the crime script concept and the 25 tech- niques of situational crime prevention to identify security functions in a structured way. To support the structured identification, we provide a hierarchical classification of vehicle- related crime as well as a categorization of existing countermeasures and new technolo- gies. •We develop four vehicle-related crime scripts and subsequently apply our methodology. We identify and propose six potential security functions, thus showing the suitability of our methodology. •We design two security functions, namely the cooperative home light (CHL) and the electronic decal (ED). We identify and analyze the underlying technologies and show the feasibility of implementing both security functions. The CHL aims to provide improved lighting to the driver when going to or from their vehicle by involving neighboring ve- hicles to provide lighting. The ED continuously broadcasts a request that the vehicle be stopped and checked by police when it is illegally moved. •We evaluate the CHL and ED with respect to the (expected) effectiveness with the help of several approaches. First, we transfer the existing results from similar countermeasures to our security functions. Second, we conduct a customer study to rate the effectiveness of reducing the fear of crime, the expected effectiveness of fighting crime and attitudes towards the CHL and ED. Third, interviewed experts assess the potential of our security functions to fight crime. Last, we propose defining measurable criteria which represent the effectiveness of both security functions. As a proof of concept, we implement a sim- ulation environment in order to simulate the CHL to estimate its effectiveness. Using these contributions, interest groups such as car manufacturers can develop supplemen- tal security measures and provide customers with <b>tangible</b> <b>security</b> functions. With this work, we pursue the goal of contributing to combat vehicle-related crime and make our mobility more secure...|$|E
40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of commercial banks is of vital importance for {{a developing country}} that is striving to enhance {{the standard of living}} of its citizens by ensuring an expansion of banking services. Several international banks have invested in Tanzania, and they have changed the competitive landscape for the local banks to implement change towards improved service delivery. Tanzania is therefore an appropriate research ground for examining the {{competitiveness of}} the banking industry by conducting a comparative analysis between foreign and local banks that are operating successfully in the country. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a model of service performance that is relevant for the Tanzanian banking industry, and a model is proposed that conceptualise service performance as two second-order constructs consisting of service innovation and service quality. The relationships between personal cultural orientation, service performance and customer satisfaction, and their effect on the corporate reputation were investigated with a view to examine the moderating role of the type of bank used by customers, on these relationships. This study used multiple group structural equation modelling to compare foreign and local banks in terms of personal cultural orientation, service performance and customer satisfaction as antecedents of customer based corporate reputation. Validity and reliability assessment as well as measurement invariance testing were performed on the measurement models used in the study. The sample comprised 380 customers, whom 196 use local banks and 184 use foreign banks. The moderating role of type of bank (local versus foreign) was investigated for the relationships between cultural orientation, service performance, customer satisfaction and corporate reputation. Two multiple group structural equation models were used to test for differences between local and foreign banks on the hypothesised relationships, in order to avoid complexity in the testing of moderation. For the first structural equation model, scales from previous studies were used to develop a service performance instrument that suited the realities of the banking industry in Tanzania, where the largely homogeneous population is geographically dispersed, and agriculture and subsistence farming are a considerable part of the economy. The service performance model included service quality and service innovation as second-order constructs. The means for both service quality and service innovation were significantly higher for foreign banks than for local banks. The first-order dimensions of service innovation were facilities for cash distribution, physical access, service access and innovativeness, whilst the first-order dimensions of service quality were <b>tangibles,</b> empathy and <b>security.</b> Measures for customer satisfaction and corporate reputation were adapted from the literature. At mean level, there were not significant differences between local and foreign banks’ customers in term of customer satisfaction or corporate reputation of their banks. Service quality was a very significant predictor of both customer satisfaction and corporate reputation for both local and foreign bank customers. The relationship between service innovation and corporate reputation was moderately significant and negative for both local and foreign banks. Customer satisfaction had a moderately significant positive relationship with corporate reputation. The relationships between service innovation, service quality, customer satisfaction and corporate reputation were not significantly different for both local and foreign banks. The second structural equation model investigated the relationships between cultural orientation, service innovation and service quality. Cultural orientation was measured with Sharma’s (2010) scale, and the dimensions consumer innovativeness, traditional values and prudence values were used in the model. Foreign bank customers had significantly higher mean values than local bank customers for consumer innovativeness and traditional values, but there was no significant difference between the two types of banks for prudence values. There were significant relationships between consumer innovativeness and the perceived service innovation of their banks for both local and foreign bank customers, with the relationship being significantly stronger for foreign bank customers. Traditional values and prudence had no significant relationship with perceptions of the service innovativeness of either group of banks. The three components of cultural orientation had the following relationships with service quality. Consumer innovativeness was not significantly related with service quality for local bank customers, and was weak, significant and negative for foreign bank customers. There was no significant relationship between traditional values and service quality for foreign banks’ customers, whereas for local banks’ customers the relationship was weak, significant and positive. Prudence was significantly and positively related to service quality for both local and foreign bank customers, and the relationship was significantly stronger in the case of foreign banks. This study suggests that both local and foreign banks are competitive banks within Tanzania and the differences in service performance between these two groups of banks can be attributed mainly to differences in the cultural orientation of the two groups of customers. It is therefore suggested that banks in Tanzania pay more attention to the personal cultural orientations of their customers in order to differentiate themselves and be more effective in serving their customers.
