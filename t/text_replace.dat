40|$|Recent {{results from}} the HERA ep {{collider}} are reviewed in these proceedings. The results are from measurements that probe QCD at high-energy scales, as defined by Q^ 2, the four-momentum-transfer squared of the collisions. These cross-section measurements provide information about the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton {{and can be used}} to constrain global fits of these PDFs. Recent measurements of the strong coupling α_S and jet substructure from HERA at similar energy scales are also reviewed. Comment: 8 pages, 14 figures.

The paper is aimed to provide an in-depth analysis {{of the evolution of}} the emerging wine markets, taking the particular case of China. The focused aspects are production, consumption trends, the distribution channels ' development as well as a newly growing tendency of Chinese acquisitions of wine properties in wine producing countries. The research methodology, which refers to industry and company reports and media materials, is based on the content analysis of semi-structured interviews conducted with 28 Chinese wine company marketing managers. The findings show that the Chinese wine market has arrived to a turning point and gets into a period of progressive changes. Small- size importers start quitting wine market while large dealers professionalize and start gaining market share. Both local producers and foreign exporters penetrate the market implementing different strategies: while local producers promote Chinese wine culture and focus on improving wine quality, foreign exporters center on building distribution channels and adjusting to the specificities of the local market...|$|E
