25|$|The curious {{personal}} {{character of}} La Fontaine, {{like that of}} some other men of letters, has been enshrined {{in a kind of}} legend by literary tradition. At an early age his absence of mind and indifference to business gave a subject to Gédéon Tallemant des Réaux. His later contemporaries helped to swell the tale, and the 18th century finally accepted it, including the anecdotes of his meeting his son, being told who he was, and remarking, Ah, yes, I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen him somewhere!, of his insisting on fighting a duel with a supposed admirer of his wife, and then imploring him to visit at his house just as before; of his going into company with his stockings wrong side out, , with, for a contrast, those of his awkwardness and silence, if not positive rudeness in company.|$|E

He later told his daughter that [...] "among a host of acquaintances I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> perhaps twenty friends. Not one of them ever spoke to me again". Others of his friends only relented after the death of the prince, who was by that stage King Edward VII.|$|E
500|$|After these rescued emigrants made {{it safely}} into Bear Valley, William Hook, Jacob Donner's stepson, broke into food stores and fatally gorged himself. The others {{continued}} on to Sutter's Fort, where Virginia Reed wrote [...] "I really <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> stepped over into paradise". She was amused {{to note that}} one of the young men asked her to marry him, although she was only 12 years old and recovering from starvation, but she turned him down.|$|E

500|$|There was {{a crowded}} field of Republican candidates, {{but the big}} leader in terms of {{establishment}} party support and fundraising was Texas Governor and presidential son George W. Bush. [...] Indeed, {{by the time of}} McCain's formal announcement, top-echelon Republican contenders such as Lamar Alexander, John Kasich, and Dan Quayle were already withdrawing from the race due to Bush's strength. [...] As McCain would later write, [...] "No one <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> much of a chance, including me." [...] Four of McCain's fifty-five fellow Republican senators endorsed his candidacy.|$|E
500|$|Stoddart went, aged seventeen, {{to train}} in fine {{art at the}} Glasgow School of Art where he studied from 1976 to 1980. There he settled on {{sculpture}} and initially worked within the modernist idiom. Stoddart has recalled an epiphany moment several times: when, after finishing a riveted metal pop-art sculpture (praised by his tutors) he found a bust of the Apollo Belvedere, [...] "I thought my pop-riveted thing was rubbish by comparison. It's extraordinarily easy to pop-rivet two bits of metal together and extraordinarily difficult to make a figure like the Apollo, but I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to try." ...|$|E
500|$|Northrup {{went to a}} {{psychiatrist}} to obtain advice about Hubbard's increasingly violent and irrational behaviour, {{and was told that}} he probably needed to be institutionalized and that she was in serious danger. She gave Hubbard an ultimatum: get treatment or she would leave with the baby. He was furious and threatened to kill Alexis rather than let Northrup care for her: [...] "He didn't want her to be brought up by me because I was in league with the doctors. He <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> thrown in with the psychiatrists, with the devils." [...] She left Palm Springs on February 3, leaving Hubbard to complain that Northrup [...] "had hypnotized him in his sleep and commanded him not to write." ...|$|E

500|$|Beauregard sent a {{telegram}} to President Davis announcing a complete victory. He later admitted, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> Grant just where I wanted him and could finish {{him up in}} the morning." [...] Many of his men were jubilant, having overrun the Union camps and taken thousands of prisoners and tons of supplies. Grant still had reason to be optimistic: Lew Wallace's 5,800 men (minus the two regiments guarding the supplies at Crump's Landing) and 15,000 of Don Carlos Buell's army began to arrive that evening. Wallace's division took up a position on the right of the Union line and was in place by 1 a.m.; Buell's men were fully on the scene by 4 a.m., in time to turn the tide the next day.|$|E
500|$|Jennings pleased {{some conservatives}} though, after his three-year {{lobbying}} {{effort to create}} a full-time religion correspondent at ABC News succeeded in the hiring of Peggy Wehmeyer in January 1994, making her the first such network reporter. ABC increased its coverage of religious topics, and in March 1995, Jennings anchored Peter Jennings Reporting: In the Name of God, a well-received documentary on the changing nature of American churches. At a taping of a [...] "town meeting" [...] segment for KOMO-TV of Seattle in February 1995, Jennings expressed regret for his ABC radio remarks on the 1994 midterm elections. [...] "People <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> insulted their sacred mandate and some thought I should go back to Canada," [...] he said. [...] "I hope I don't make that mistake again." ...|$|E
500|$|Groza took 1960 off and {{did some}} {{scouting}} for the team. He also focused on an insurance business he started. [...] "I was 36 and I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> retired", he said. The following year, however, {{he came back to}} the team at the urging of Art Modell, who bought the Browns that year. Not wanting to use a roster spot on a kicking specialist (Groza's back injury prevented him from playing on the line), Brown had signed Sam Baker to kick and play halfback. But Groza was eager to return and Modell insisted. Groza stayed with the team as a placekicker until 1967, and was on a Browns team that won the 1964 championship. Groza scored the first points in that game on a third-quarter field goal. He also kicked four kickoffs more than [...] and out of the Baltimore Colts end zone, preventing a return. Cleveland won 27–0.|$|E

500|$|Lifehouse {{lead singer}} Jason Wade had many inspirations when writing songs for Who We Are. When {{asked about the}} {{background}} of lead single [...] "First Time", Wade said, [...] "It just felt urgent, like a first kiss, a first love. [...] Like {{the first time you}} realize there's more to that relationship than you <b>thought.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to dig a little for that one, but I find myself at a place where I can write stuff that's a little deeper than your average love song in terms of emotion." [...] Wade was inspired to write [...] "The Joke" [...] after he read a newspaper article that detailed the story of a British boy who hung himself as a result of being bullied by his fellow schoolmates. The song [...] "Broken" [...] was written by Wade after he visited a friend in Nashville that needed a kidney transplant.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the film's songs and soundtrack began on October 2, 1995, at CTS Studios in London. It took almost {{four months to}} record all the songs, which involved creating the music first and then the lyrics. Parker declared {{the first day of}} recording as [...] "Black Monday", and recalled it as a worrisome and nervous day. He said, [...] "All of us came from very different worlds—from popular music, from movies, and from musical theater—and so we were all very apprehensive." [...] The cast was also nervous; Banderas found the experience [...] "scary", while Madonna was [...] "petrified" [...] when it came to recording the songs. [...] "I had to sing 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber... I was a complete mess and was sobbing afterward. I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done a terrible job", the singer recalled.|$|E
500|$|The Suns showbiz editor Dominic Mohan {{recalled}} of the period: [...] "We {{had quite}} a few Oasis contacts on the payroll. I don't know whether any were drug dealers, {{but there was always}} a few dodgy characters about." [...] Oasis's official photographer Jill Furmanovsky felt the media's focus, and was preyed upon by tabloid journalists living in the flat upstairs from her: [...] "They <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the band hiding in my flat." [...] In paranoia, Oasis cut themselves off from their wider circle. According to Johnny Hopkins, the publicist of Oasis's label Creation Records, [...] "People were being edged out of the circle around Oasis. People who knew them before they were famous rather than because they were famous." [...] Hopkins likened the situation to a medieval court, complete with kings, courtiers and jesters. As he explained, [...] "nce you're in that situation you lose sight of reality." ...|$|E

500|$|According to the singer, she {{was very}} nervous during {{the first day of}} recording. She {{allegedly}} found herself [...] "petrified" [...] when it came to doing the song; [...] "I had to sing 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber [...] I was a complete mess and was sobbing afterward. I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done a terrible job", she recalled. The final version recorded had much similarities to the original version by Covington, although had a much faster pace and was created as an orchestral pop to cater to the contemporary music scene. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, Madonna's version of the song is set in common time, with a slow groove tempo of 90 beats per minute. Madonna's vocals on the song span from G3 to C5. The song follows a basic sequence of C–F–C when Madonna sings [...] "It won't be easy, you'll think it strange", and changes to G7–C on the second verse.|$|E
500|$|Thomas {{stated that}} he was {{interested}} in writing a feature film based on the series, in the interest of providing closure to the storylines and character arcs. In September 2008, Thomas told Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the idea broken, but I've hit a wall in the final act that I haven't quite figured out". Thomas explained that he was very busy writing for Cupid and Party Down, both of which he created. In January 2009, TV Guide reported that the film was Thomas' first priority after Cupid. Thomas noted that as well as writing the script, someone would need to pay for the film, but indicated that producer Joel Silver was ready to green-light the film. In late March, Thomas stated that although the film was not green-lit by the studio, the possibility was still there. Thomas revealed that the film would take place before Veronica's graduation, and feature Wallace, Logan, Mac and Weevil.|$|E
500|$|Edwards {{signed for}} League One side Stevenage on 27 June 2011. He joined the club on a free transfer, rejecting a {{contract}} extension at Accrington. He signed a one-year deal with Stevenage, with the option of a second year. On joining the club he said [...] "I wasn't particularly looking for another club and I didn't {{have any interest in}} any other clubs at the time, so I thought I'd still be at Accrington next season. However, the manager got in touch with my agent and discussed the offer and when I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the chance of playing League One football I decided to sign for Stevenage". Edwards was assigned the number six shirt ahead of the 2011–12 season. He made his Stevenage debut {{on the first day of}} the 2011–12 season, playing the whole match in a 0–0 home draw against Exeter City. Edwards made 13 starting appearances for the club, as well as a further 14 appearances from the substitute's bench, during the first half of the club's first ever League One campaign.|$|E

500|$|... "Humpty Dumpty World" [...] {{incorporates}} the marimba with light reggae and Mariachi influences. The song's lyrics are sung {{from the perspective}} of God, who deplores the world He created. He makes note of incitive politicians and craven television commentators, and views it as [...] "a ball of confusion" [...] in the chorus line, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> built upon a solid rock / But it’s just a Humpty Dumpty World". [...] "Christmas Time This Year" [...] is an anti-war song with a Mexican polka style, with Flaco Jiménez on accordion and Cooder on bajo sexto. Composed as a corrido, the song is about wounded soldiers returning home for Christmas, with dismal lyrics set incongruously to an upbeat Mexican melody. Cooder wrote the song in response to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center neglect scandal and previous stories of neglected soldiers returning from the Iraq War. In [...] "Baby Joined the Army", a young man laments the departure of his girlfriend, who became uninterested in her town and enlisted in the army with the assurance that [...] "If I get killed in battle, I still get paid." ...|$|E
500|$|Still in {{a shallow}} dive, I {{observed}} another P-38 and an Me 109 going round and round. It seemed that the 38 needed help so I started down. At about , [...] the Jerry, still way out of my range, turned under me and slightly to the right. I rolled over on my back, following him and gave him an ineffective burst at long range. By this time I was traveling in excess of [...] My left window blew out, scaring {{the hell out of}} me. I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been hit by some of the ground fire I had observed in the vicinity. I regained control of the aircraft and pulled out above a wheat field. I tried to contact the flight to get myself recognized, but observed an Me 109 making a pass at me from about seven o'clock high. I broke left as well as my plane could and the Jerry overshot. I straightened out and gave him a burst. He chandelled steeply to the left and I shot some more. He passed right over me and I slipped over in an Immelmann. As I straightened out at the top, I saw the pilot bail out.|$|E
500|$|Store Frøen's rural {{surroundings}} {{shaped the}} nature of Nansen's childhood. In the short summers the main activities were swimming and fishing, while in the autumn the chief pastime was hunting for game in the forests. The long winter months were devoted mainly to skiing, which Nansen began to practice {{at the age of}} two, on improvised skis. [...] At the age of 10 he defied his parents and attempted the ski jump at the nearby Huseby installation. This exploit had near-disastrous consequences, as on landing the skis dug deep into the snow, pitching the boy forward: [...] "I, head first, described a fine arc in the air ... hen I came down again I bored into the snow up to my waist. The boys <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> broken my neck, but as soon as they saw there was life in me ... a shout of mocking laughter went up." [...] Nansen's enthusiasm for skiing was undiminished, though as he records, his efforts were overshadowed by those of the skiers from the mountainous region of Telemark, where a new style of skiing was being developed. [...] "I saw this was the only way", wrote Nansen later.|$|E
