5|$|The first Giro d'Italia {{was a great}} success, {{prompting}} organizers {{to arrange}} a second one for 1910. The race substantially increased La Gazzettas circulation, and the starts and finishes were attended by large audiences. Ganna's prize money helped him start his own bike factory in 1912.

5|$|Curse of Enchantia {{was officially}} {{revealed}} under this title at the European Computer Trade Show (ECTS) in April 1992. The game was originally {{planned to be}} released in September 1992, but got delayed two months to November 1992. It was the first adventure game by Core Design as well {{as one of the first}} CD-ROM adventure games. Virgin Games bundled it with many of the earliest PC CD-ROM drives in 1993. It was also re-released on CD as part of Encore Multipack, together with Heimdall and Thunderhawk. The game's original release was accompanied by a promotional campaign with valuable prizes (computers and money) in some magazines such as France's Joystick.

5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{receives}} {{news that}} his Aunt Shirley has died, and he informs the office.

At the funeral, Dwight's family gathers: his cousins Mose (Michael Schur) and Zeke (Matt Jones), his brother Jeb (Thomas Middleditch), his sister Fannie (Majandra Delfino), his nephew Cammy (Blake Garrett Rosenthal), and his uncle Heinrich (Tom Bower). The family learns that Aunt Shirley has willed the siblings her estate {{on the condition that}} they all come back home <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>it.</b> Despite Dwight's enthusiasm in inheriting it, Fannie and Jeb are unwilling to move back in {{due to the lack of}} sophistication farm life offers.

5|$|Free-labor proponents in the East {{also wanted}} to create a similar {{organization}} in the western states. In the 1840s members of the Salem Free Produce Association approached Coffin to see if he would be interested in managing the proposed Western Free Produce Association. At first he declined, saying he lacked the money required to fund the venture, and {{that he did not want}} to move into the city. In 1845 a group of abolitionist businessmen opened a wholesale mercantile business in Cincinnati and the Free Produce Association raised $3,000 to help stock the new warehouse with goods. Different groups continued to pressure Coffin to accept a position as the new business's director, claiming there were no other western abolitionists qualified to manage the enterprise. Reluctantly, he finally agreed to oversee the warehouse for five years, in which time he could train someone else <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>it,</b> and in 1847 Levi and Catharine Coffin moved to Ohio.|$|E

5|$|Heseltine {{had long}} nurtured {{a scheme to}} launch a music magazine, which he {{intended}} to start {{as soon as he}} found appropriate backing. In April 1920, Rogers decided to replace his semi-moribund magazine The Organist and Choirmaster, with a new music journal, The Sackbut, and invited Heseltine to edit it. Heseltine presided over nine issues, adopting a style that was combative and often controversial. The Sackbut also organised concerts, presenting works by van Dieren, Sorabji, Ladmirault and others. However, Rogers withdrew his financial backing after five issues. Heseltine then struggled <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>it</b> himself for several months; in September 1921 the magazine was taken over by the publisher John Curwen, who promptly replaced Heseltine as editor with Ursula Greville.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg (1797–1871) {{started making}} pianos in 1835 {{from his house}} in Seesen {{at the edge of}} the Harz mountains; a source of fine beech and spruce wood for the instruments. Among the pianos that Steinweg {{produced}} in his first year was a square piano designed by and built for Friedrick Grotrian. (This instrument is now in the Braunschweig museum.) H.E. Steinweg entered three of his pianos in a state fair in 1839, two of them square pianos, but his grand piano brought wide notice. In 1850, H.E. Steinweg took most of his large family to New York City, leaving the piano factory to his eldest son C.F. Theodor Steinweg (1825–1889) who stayed behind <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>it</b> under his own name. Meanwhile, in New York City, the Steinweg family Americanized their surname to Steinway and in 1853 they founded the piano manufacturer Steinway & Sons.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Rabi {{became a}} member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. That month, the British Tizard Mission brought a number of new {{technologies}} to the United States, including a cavity magnetron, a high-powered device that generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field. This device, which promised to revolutionize radar, demolished any thoughts the Americans had entertained about their technological leadership. Alfred Lee Loomis of the National Defense Research Committee decided to establish a new laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop this radar technology. The name Radiation Laboratory was chosen as both unremarkable and a tribute to the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Loomis recruited Lee DuBridge <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{few weeks}} before the debut of the No. 5 locomotive, the railroad, {{for the first time in}} its history, hosted a privately owned train on its track. On the morning of May 10, before Disneyland opened for the day, a private {{ceremony}} was held at New Orleans Square Station to honor Disney animator and rail enthusiast Ollie Johnston, supposedly to thank him for helping to inspire Walt Disney's passion for trains, which led to the creation of Disneyland. The true motive for having Johnston there was soon revealed when a simple steam train not part of the DRR's rolling stock, consisting of a locomotive named Marie E. and a caboose, rolled towards the station and stopped at its platform. Johnston, a previous owner of the steam train, used <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>it</b> on his vacation property, which he sold, along with the train, in 1993. The man who now owned the train was Pixar film director John Lasseter, who had brought the train to Disneyland in order to give Johnston, his mentor, an opportunity to reunite with and drive his former locomotive. Johnston, then in his nineties, was helped into the Marie E., and with Lasseter at his side, he grasped the locomotive's throttle and drove his former possession three times around the DRR's main line. Although Johnston died in 2008, Lasseter continues to run the Marie E., the caboose, and an assortment of train cars on his private Justi Creek Railway, which is complemented by the depot building and water tower from Ward Kimball's former Grizzly Flats Railroad.|$|E
5|$|When the Newmans {{win their}} lawsuit, Katherine decides to help Victor get Beauty of Nature back for Victor. In May 2011, Tucker {{ends up in}} a coma after being run down by a drunken Abby and Ashley takes the blame. Tucker signed a DNR but Katherine and Ashley keep Tucker from being taken off life support and Katherine is left in charge of McCall Unlimited. Tucker's living will also reveals {{that he has a}} son who stands to inherit 20 million dollars if he is found. Meanwhile, Katherine reverses all of Tucker's most recent {{business}} decisions and he and Ashley marry when he wakes up from his coma. Though Tucker is physically recovered, he lost all of his business sense and Ashley must run the company in secret until he recovers fearing Katherine may try to take his company again. Afterward, Tucker is one of several suspects when Diane is murdered and he fires Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), from his record label. In turn Katherine launches her own record label as a subsidiary of Chancellor Industries and hires Devon <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>it.</b> Tucker teams up with Jack again to overturn the sale of Jabot and a shocked Katherine ends up in the hospital after a stroke. Tucker accidentally learns from Jill that Devon is his son, and Devon refuses to accept Tucker as his new father, and disowns Katherine for hiding the truth. Meanwhile, Devon's formerly drug addicted mother, now known as Harmony (Debbi Morgan), returns to Genoa City to explain her reasons for hiding Devon's paternity. Tucker stands in as the godfather of Moses Winters, the son of his longtime friend and confidant, Sofia Dupre (Julia Pace Mitchell). Tucker does his best to build a relationship with his son, but Devon constantly rejects him. He and Ashley later renew their vows and Devon finally lets his guard down and comes to the wedding.|$|E
