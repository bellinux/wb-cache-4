The {{variables in the}} study were manufacturer (Marshall Industries Composites, Inc. [M 1] and Corrosion Proof Products/Hughes Brothers [M 2]), bar size (No. 5 and 6), cover (2 and 3 bar diameters), and embedment length (10 through 47 in.). Eighty-four inverted half-beam bond specimens were tested while monitoring load, loaded-end slip, free-end slip, cracking, and acoustic emissions on the embedded bar and concrete. Neither bar was recommended for immediate use as reinforcement in bridge decks. The M 1 rebar exhibited cracking and splitting along the outer coating of the bar which damaged bar deformations. Additionally these bars exhibited larger COVs for bar failures with average ultimate loads below the reported manufacturer's value. The M 2 rebar exhibited a smaller COV for <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> <b>bar</b> failures and a similar ultimate load average when compared to the manufacturer's reported strength.

Operating {{within the context of}} natural-fiber reinforced thermoplastics, this investigation concentrates on the prediction of the local mechanical properties of an injection molded part. To realize this, the Autodesk Simulation Moldflow Insight 2014 software has been used. In this software, a fiber breakage algorithm for the polymer flow inside the mold is available. For the local fiber orientation, the anisotropy rotary diffusion-reduced strain closure have been used which is typical for fibers longer than 2 mm. Using well known micro mechanic formulas allow to combine the local fiber length with the local orientation into local mechanical properties. Different experiments were performed using an own made flax-PP compound to compare the measured data with the numerical simulation results. To feed the numerical simulation software with material data, reverse engineering has been applied for both rheological and mechanical data for this kind of material based on tests for simple geometries (<b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> <b>bar).</b> In this investigation, initially, tensile tests and 3 point bending tests are considered. Using the appropriate settings for the different experiments, good predictions of the local mechanical properties are obtained.

40|$|Abstract. Aluminium-silicon alloys having {{different}} silicon contents (13, 20 and 27 percent) {{were used}} in the present study. The molten alloys were poured in to a mild steel die to cast <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> <b>bars.</b> Then <b>tensile</b> and hardness <b>tests</b> were performed in order to analyze the properties and fracture surfaces of the cast specimens. Results show that as silicon content increases, the alloy becomes harder and less ductile. At the same time, the presence of alloying and impurity elements in the alloys forms complex compounds and intermetallic phases. They present deleterious effects on the strength of the alloys, causing a lowering of the energy required to fracture the test specimens with little permanent extension. However, heat treatment operations altered the structures and properties of the aluminium-silicon alloys. Heating to higher temperature, then quenching, ageing and tempering make the alloys stronger up to 13 % silicon and beyond that limit the alloys become weaker, fracturing at lower load. The appearance of fracture surfaces after <b>tensile</b> <b>testing</b> showed these differences. This investigation also suggests that for the aluminium-silicon alloys containing 20 % and 27 % silicon do not require any expensive and time consuming thermal treatment operations, since properties do not improve with such treatments...|$|R

Compounds with neoalkoxy titanate or zirconate coupling agents were also produced to improve interfacial interaction and filler dispersion in the composites. The composites were molded into <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> <b>bars</b> using (i) conventional injection molding and (ii) shear-controlled orientation in injection molding (SCORIM). This latter molding technique {{was used to}} deliberately induce a strong anisotropic character to the composites. The mechanical characterization included <b>tensile</b> <b>testing</b> and microhardness measurements. The morphology of the moldings was studied by both polarized light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and the structure developed was assessed by wide-angle X-ray diffraction.

The higher mechanical performance of SCORIMprocessed composites results from the much higher orientation of the matrix and, to a lesser extent, from the superior degree of filler dispersion compared with conventional moldings. The strong anisotropy of the SCORIM moldings is associated with a clear laminated morphology developed during shear application stage. The titanate and the zirconate coupling agents caused significant variations in the <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> behavior, but their influence was strongly dependent on the molding technique employed.

The bars produced were mechanically characterized by means of <b>tensile</b> <b>testing</b> and dynamical mechanical analysis (DMA). The structure of the moldings was assessed by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and the failure surfaces of the moldings analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The enhancement of stiffness observed with HA reinforcement results partially from the stiffening effect of the blend associated with the decrease in plasticizer content during the compounding stage. SCORIM was able to further increase the stiffness of SEVA-C/HA composites, allowing a maximum improvement of 12 % for 30 % wt. HA as compared to conventional molding. DMA {{results showed that the}} reinforcement of SEVA-C causes the broadening of the relaxation peak of the polymer, suggesting a structural change within the starch fraction that may be related with thermal degradation of the polymer. The addition of HA particles reduces the preferred orientation exhibited by the SEVA-C matrix, which is believed to limit the maximum mechanical performance that can be attained.

Most {{processing}} parameters, except heating rate, were kept constant. During the heating {{of the experimental}} speci-mens from 700 °C to the sintering temperature of 1300 °C, heating rates were varied, e. g., 2. 5, 5. 0, and 10. 0 °C/min. Experimental results showed that a material heated with a low heating rate tended to have higher sintered density and tensile strength. However, the low heating rate caused grain growth in the sintered material. These results are in contradiction with the improved densification of some ceramics by ultra rapid heating. The reasons for contradiction are as follows. First, the heat-ing rates employed in this work are not very different. The second is attributed to small thermal gradients generated in the thin metal powder compacts. Because of these reasons, densification of the sintered stainless steels series 300 is controlled by an isothermal condition. The low heating rate allows longer time for atomic diffusion, which is an important sintering factor. This means more atoms move to points of contact between powder particles to form necking and to cause necking growth. This results in better sintering. However, the low heating rate means that the materials are exposed to heat for longer time and thus their grains {{have a tendency to}} grow...|$|R

The mechanical properties of the moulded parts were assessed by both <b>tensile</b> and impact <b>tests.</b> The respective morphologies were characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the semicrystalline structures of the matrices investigated by X-ray diffraction. The final fibre length distribution and fibre orientation profiles along the part thickness were also quantified. The composites with lower viscosity exhibit higher stiffness, higher strength and superior impact performance. Both composites exhibit a three layer laminated morphology, featuring two shell zones and a core region. Interfacial interaction is favoured by a lower melt viscosity that enhances the wetting of the fibre surfaces and promotes mechanical interlocking. The composites display a bimodal fibre length distribution that accounts for significant fibre length degradation upon processing. The dimensions of the transversely orientated core differ for the two composites, which is attributed to the dissimilar pseudoplastic behaviour of the two HDPE grades and the different thermal levels of the compounds during injection moulding.

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} into Pressure Assisted Macrosegregation during the squeeze casting of an aluminium alloy, LM 25, and an aluminium based silicon carbide particulate metal matrix composite. The squeeze casting process is particularly prone {{to this type of}} segregation which results in large areas of solute rich material in the final casting. The fundamental causes of the segregation have, until now, not been fully understood. This has restricted the use of squeeze casting as it was believed that the cause was a fundamental manufacturing weakness. An existing squeeze casting facility at Warwick was used to produce cast samples for study. The facility produces simple <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> <b>bars.</b> Inserts for the die were designed to specifically produce the segregation within the castings. Thermocouples were threaded through the die wall and placed within the casting to enable the recording of the thermal history during solidification. Samples were taken from the castings, mounted, ground and polished for study via an optical microscope. A mechanism for the formation of the segregation is proposed. The primary causes of the segregation are shown to be surface tension, of the molten alloy, and the design of the component. The widespread belief that this form of segregation is a fundamental weakness of the squeeze casting process is therefore shown to be false. A theoretical model to a first approximation of the segregation, using the Young and Laplace equation is given. Using the pressure difference across a thin film the minimum web width, or radius of a corner, for no significant segregation can be found. The model is expanded and presented in a graphical form which is easy to understand and provides the designer with some tools to enable a sound casting to be produced. By sensible design the segregation phenomenon can be significantly reduced and in some cases eliminated completely. ...|$|R

40|$|Compacted {{graphite}} iron is rapidly becoming an attractive alternative for engine {{applications in the}} automotive industry. The improved process control now available that allows CGI components to be cast in a reproducible and reliable way has been the driving force for this development. To be able to optimise the properties in a CGI component {{it is crucial to}} have extensive knowledge of the factors influencing microstructure formation in the material. To understand microstructure formation and how the microstructure influences the mechanical properties a series casting trials were performed. A hemispherical sampling cup was used enabling temperature measurements as well as evaluation of the microstructure and a geometry consisting of cylinders of different diameters was used to obtain <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> <b>bars.</b> A range of cooling rates and chemical compositions were studied in the casting experiments, resulting in substantial differences in both graphite morphology and matrix structure, suggesting that mechanical properties will vary accordingly. Nineteen trials were cast investigating the influence of varying: nodularity treatment level, Cu-content, Si-content, Sn-content and varying content of carbide promoting elements (Cr, Mn and Mo). It was found {{that the majority of the}} investigated alloying elements (Cu, Mg, Si and Sn) affect the graphite morphology. Similar to other graphitic cast irons Cu, Sn and carbide promoting elements promote pearlite formation in CGI, while Si promotes ferrite formation. It was also found that higher nodularity favours a pearlitic matrix structure. Mechanical properties are generally raised by increasing nodularity and increasing pearlite content, but a contribution from solution hardening of ferrite was found at high Si-contents. The influence of carbides on mechanical properties was negligible, for the investigated alloying contents and cooling conditions. From the microstructure investigation it was found that CGI is prone to develop a ferritic matrix. It was also clear that segregation of pearlite and ferrite promoting elements influenced the ferrite content. A deterministic model was developed to describe the ferrite growth in CGI. The growth rate of the ferrite border was assumed to be determined by an interface reaction at the ferrite-graphite interface, and that specifically the amount of carbon atoms that can be added to the graphite played a dominant role...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} the welding cycle on the {{fracture}} toughness properties of high-strength low alloy (HSLA) steels is examined by means of thermal simulation of heat-affected zone (HAZ) microstructures. <b>Tensile</b> <b>tests</b> on notched <b>bars</b> and fracture toughness tests at various temperatures are performed together with fracture surface observations and cross-sectional analyses. The influence of martensite-austenite (M-A) constituents and of “crystallographic” bainite packets on cleavage fracture micromechanisms is, thus, evidenced {{as a function of}} temperature. Three weakest-link probabilistic models (the “Master-curve” (MC) approach, the Beremin model, and a "double-barrier" (DB) model) are applied to account for the ductileto-brittle transition (DBT) fracture toughness curve. Some analogy, but also differences, are found between the MC approach and the Beremin model. The DB model, having nonfitted, physically based scatter parameters, is applied to the martensite-containing HAZ microstructures and gives promising results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Finite Element Method is a {{numerical}} analysis technique {{that has been}} extensively used in industry, and one specific area of development {{is the study of}} impact simulation and assessment of energy absorption capability of materials. However, the energy absorption capability is directly dependent on material ductility, so that in order to correctly predict the onset of failure it is necessary to have accurate failure criteria. The objective of this work is to study the applicability of different failure criteria available in commercial finite element codes, in the simulation of stainless steel beams under impact. Initially, material characterization was done through several experimental <b>tests</b> which involve <b>tensile</b> <b>tests</b> and Hopkinson <b>Bar</b> <b>tests.</b> Next, impact tests were made with clamped beams. A high speed camera was used to record the experiments, and electronic devices were built in order to synchronize experimental data with the high speed image acquisition system. All experimental tests were simulated by using Finite Element Method and simulation results were compared to the experimental ones in order to verify the accuracy of failure criteria employed...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} dealing with {{hydrogen}} embrittlement of austenitic-ferritic 2205 duplex steel using the slow strain rate test (SSRT). The original material was subjected to heat treatment under 700 °C during 5 hours and following aircooling {{with the aim of}} provoking sigma phase precipitation and embrittlement of the material. The samples of both states were electrolytic saturation with hydrogen in 0, 1 N solution of sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) with addition KSCN during 24 hours. The hydrogen embrittlement appeared on fracture surfaces of <b>tested</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>bars</b> as a quasi-cleavage damage on their perimeter. From the established depth of hydrogen charging the diff usion coeffi cient of hydrogen in duplex steel with ferritic-austenitic structure and with the structure containing the sigma phase as well were estimated.

40|$|Abstract The {{fracture}} {{process of}} cast iron is initiated at the graphite nodules, followed by intensive void growth and coalescence. Two- and three-dimensional cell models are developed to study the influence of stress triaxdity and void arrangement on these microscopical damage processes in nodular cast iron. The applicability of the Gurson model {{to this type of}} material is investigated and related to the cell model results. The calculations show that during a tensile loading graphite nodules hinder the transverse deformation of the matrix if the stress triaxiality for the loading is less than GJJG~=OJ. Otherwise the graphite nodules can s w l y be modelled by voids. The three-dimensional cell models turned out that the spatial arrangement of periodic arrays of voids has only weak influence on the defonnation behaviour, whereas the plastic collapse behaviour is strongly aEected. The simulation of <b>tensile</b> <b>tests</b> with notched <b>bars</b> demonstrates that the Gurson model can be used to characterize nodular cast iron if the triaxialty of the loading is not too low. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} on Mg-based alloys containing Zn and Mn. The alloys were cast in a permanent metallic mold preheated to 200 °C and with a protective atmosphere of dry air, CO 2, and SF 6. Two main phases are observed in the as-cast condition: Mg-Al-Zn and Mn-Al intermetallics. The size and morphology of the Mg-Al-Zn phase are significantly affected by the concentration of Al. Tensile properties, using standard ASTM B- 108 samples, {{are directly related to}} the size, morphology, and density of the existing phase particles. The alloy ductility is reduced with increase in the Al concentration, whereas the ultimate tensile strength and the yield strength are more or less stable. The fracture surface of the <b>tested</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>bars</b> is mostly ductile for low Al-containing alloys and tends to be brittle with the increase in Al content as evidenced by an increase in the density of cleavage ruptured areas...|$|R

The castings based on these materials show relatively good mechanical properties that decrease significantly with an increasing temperature of their thermal exposure.
