5|$|An {{individual}} {{currency devaluation}} has to involve a corresponding {{rise in value}} {{for at least one}} other currency. The corresponding rise will generally be spread across all other currencies and so unless the devaluing country has a huge economy and is substantially devaluing, <b>the</b> <b>offsetting</b> rise for any individual currency will tend to be small or even negligible. In normal times other countries are often content to accept a small rise in the value of their own currency or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if much of the world is suffering from a recession, from low growth or are pursuing strategies which depend on a favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this can trigger corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their export competitiveness.|$|E

It also enables <b>the</b> <b>offsetting</b> of payment flows between geographical areas, reducing the cost of settlement between them.|$|E
25|$|In 1850, {{the land}} was {{occupied}} by free blacks and Irish immigrants who had purchased land, where they raised livestock, built churches and cemeteries, and had lived as a community for close to 50 years. Before {{the construction of the}} park could start, the area had to be cleared of its inhabitants. Rossi states that part of the impetus to schemes such as Central Park and others was to remove what they incorrectly deemed as shanty towns and their denizens. However, most lived in small villages, such as Harsenville, the Piggery District, or Seneca Village; or in the school and convent at Mount St. Vincent's Academy. Approximately 1,600 residents were evicted under the rule of eminent domain during 1857. Seneca Village and parts of the other communities were razed {{to make room for the}} park. In addition, when the commission finally submitted its report for public examination on October 4, 1855, taxpayers learned that they would be paying $5 million just for the park land, more than three times what they had been told the completed park as a whole would cost. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>offsetting</b> revenue from property taxes of adjacent land came to $1.7 million, or one-third of the purchase price, and was considerably less than earlier estimates.|$|E

In 2002, the Environmental Defence Society (EDS) appealed the consents to the Environment Court. In the decision Environmental Defence Society (Incorporated) v Auckland Regional Council and Contact Energy, the Environment Court agreed that the predicted annual emissions of 1.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide would contribute to climate change via the greenhouse effect. The Environment Court agreed with the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change {{and concluded that the}} proposed CO2 emissions would be an [...] "adverse effect of some consequence" [...] under the RMA. However the court declined to grant the relief requested by EDS. That was to impose conditions requiring the complete offsetting of the carbon dioxide emissions by planting new forests. The court cited its concerns over its [...] "efficacy, appropriateness and reasonableness" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>offsetting</b> conditions.|$|E

In the its press release announcing the settlement of the suit, the commission stated “at the time she approved and signed the 1998 annual report, Wachner knew or should have known that the restatement of the company's financial results was caused by material flaws in the cost accounting and internal control systems at one of the company's largest divisions and was not related to the write-up of deferred start-up or start-up related costs." [...] The commission also found that [...] "Wachner knew or should have known that the division's inventory costing control system was inadequate to ensure the accuracy of Warnaco's books and records and failed to ensure that proper internal controls were in place.” Stanley P. Silverstein, who was Warnaco’s general counsel at the time was also named, as he, too, signed off on the report.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} to approximate <b>the</b> variable radius <b>offset</b> curves by cubic B'ezier curves. <b>The</b> <b>offset</b> curve is approximated by a cubic B'ezier curve which interpolates the positions and derivatives of <b>the</b> exact <b>offset</b> curve at both end points. Thus, it approximates <b>the</b> exact <b>offset</b> curve very closely near the curve end points, {{but not necessarily}} {{in the middle of}} the curve. Given a fixed base curve, by changing <b>the</b> <b>offset</b> radius and its derivative at an end point, one can easily control <b>the</b> <b>offset</b> curve shape near the end point. To better control <b>the</b> <b>offset</b> curve shape {{in the middle of the}} curve, we use two global shape parameters (bias and tension) of <b>the</b> <b>offset</b> curve (see [16]).

40|$|Abstract − <b>The</b> <b>offset</b> of an ADC {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{limitations}} for interleaved architectures. The method proposed here enables a precise measurement of <b>the</b> <b>offset</b> while <b>the</b> ADC operates and introduces a minimum disturb to the output result. The method exploits a random modulation by + 1 or- 1 of the input signal. The modulating signal is the wide-band output of a Chua circuit passed through a comparator. The resulting spread spectrum can be easily distinguished by <b>the</b> dc <b>offset</b> and reconstructed in the digital domain with a synchronous demodulation. The use of a digital accumulator extracts <b>the</b> <b>offset.</b> <b>The</b> accumulation time can be many clock periods (like 106) thus permitting an excellent accuracy in <b>the</b> <b>offset</b> measurement. Simulations of the proposed approach at the behavioral level confirm the effectiveness of the method.
