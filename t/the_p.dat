5|$|It was {{determined}} that P. rebeli larvae use chemical mimicry to persuade the M. schencki ants that <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli {{are part of the}} ant brood. Furthermore, M. schencki ants cannot distinguish the physical differences between <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli larvae and other non-kin brood because <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli larvae are far more similar to the M. schencki larvae than to any other ant species larvae.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} {{hypothesize that}} another alternative growth strategy will evolve in <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli, in which <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli will parasitize the M. schencki ants {{for an even}} {{longer period of time}} than the slow developing larvae. Most researchers, however, find this hypothesis highly unlikely because it is not an evolutionarily stable strategy. At the rate <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli parasitizes the M. schencki ants, the host colony is unlikely to last as a viable food source {{for more than two years}} (the average lifespan of the longer polymorph of P. rebeli).

The {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) {{assembly of}} <b>the</b> palladium nanoparticles (<b>Pd</b> NPs) was studied in this work. <b>The</b> cubic <b>Pd</b> NPs were successfully synthesized and assembled on mica and silicon wafer in the dip-coating way. The morphology of <b>the</b> <b>Pd</b> NPs and <b>the</b> topography of <b>the</b> <b>Pd</b> NPs assembly on the substrates were characterized with {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). In {{the process of the}} fabrication, the excess cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was removed with the “deposition-redispersion” strategy, the UV-vis spectra and zeta-potential of <b>the</b> <b>Pd</b> NPs colloid were measured.

The hydrophilic property of the substrate is the crucial factor to control the 2 D assembly of <b>the</b> <b>Pd</b> NPs.

5|$|The {{reasons for}} this drastic {{population}} reduction {{are thought to be}} due to agricultural improvements, abandonment of extensive management, and deforestation. As the area of the Gentiana cruciata, the food plant that <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli depends on, decreases, <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli population also decreases.|$|E
5|$|To {{test this}} hypothesis, {{researchers}} examined how each species utilized the host ants. The M. schencki, M. sabuleti are parasitized by P. rebeli while the M. salina and M. vandeli are parasitized by <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> alcon. The M. scabrinodis is parasitized by both <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli and <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> alcon; however, <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> alcon {{is far more}} likely to parasitize M. scabrinodis than <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli. Researchers found that in general, P. alcon was {{far more likely to}} parasitize the host ant than P. rebeli; however, ant nests that supported <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> alcon were much smaller and supported lower populations than ant nests that supported P. rebeli.|$|E
5|$|While the Myrmica ant colony can {{identify}} {{each other through}} chemical signaling, social ranks are partially determined by sound acoustics. Therefore, once <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli begin to mimic {{the sound of the}} queen ant, the worker ants begin to treat <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli {{as if it were the}} queen ant. On the other hand, the queen ant treats <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli larvae and pupae as if they were rivals, as she is the only one in the colony that recognizes that <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli larvae is not ant larvae.|$|E

5|$|Behavioral ecologists {{have found}} {{its role as}} a brood {{parasite}} to be of particular interest as, unlike many brood parasites, it does not directly oviposit in the hosts' nests. <b>The</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli parasitizes the colony ant species Myrmica schencki as a larva by using chemical mimicry to trick the ants into believing that they are ant larvae; thus, the ants bring <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli larvae back to their own nests and feed them. It also parasitizes the food plant Gentiana cruciata early in its life cycle, but in turn, is parasitized by the Ichneumon eumerus when it is in the M. schencki nest. It was placed on the IUCN Red List in 2000 and is classified as a species 'vulnerable' to extinction. Although a separate species from <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> alcon, its DNA genome and appearance are extremely similar, leading many researchers to argue that any differences between the two species are due to intraspecific variation.|$|E

5|$|P. rebeli live in {{different}} habitats; therefore, {{they do not}} parasitize the same Myrmica ant species.

The differences between <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli are that they synthesize different hydrocarbons, which allow them to mimic different species of Myrmica ants.

5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli {{caterpillars}} benefit most when they parasitize off of the Myrmica schencki ant colony than any other ant colony. When Myrmica ant colonies encounter a period of food shortage, more P. rebeli caterpillars survive than if this food shortage were to occur in any other species of ant colony. This is because <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli caterpillars have a lower social rank in other ant species compared to their social rank in the M. schencki ant colony. This phenomenon is seen during times of stress, {{when some of the}} hungry P. rebeli caterpillars secrete compounds to attract attention from the ant colony it has parasitized. While the M. schencki ants are still fooled into believing that <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli are of their own brood, these compounds do not mimic those of non-host species' societies in other ant species, and thus, results in <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli being identified as intruders and killed.|$|E
