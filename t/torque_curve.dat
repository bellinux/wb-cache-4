25|$|Motor speed can {{be changed}} because the <b>torque</b> <b>curve</b> of the motor is {{effectively}} modified {{by the amount of}} resistance connected to the rotor circuit. Increasing the value of resistance will move the speed of maximum torque down. If the resistance connected to the rotor is increased beyond the point where the maximum torque occurs at zero speed, the torque will be further reduced.|$|E
25|$|When {{used with}} a load that has a <b>torque</b> <b>curve</b> that {{increases}} with speed, the motor will operate at the speed where the torque developed by the motor {{is equal to the}} load torque. Reducing the load will cause the motor to speed up, and increasing the load will cause the motor to slow down until the load and motor torque are equal. Operated in this manner, the slip losses are dissipated in the secondary resistors and can be very significant. The speed regulation and net efficiency is also very poor.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} frozen again in January, 1974. A {{stainless}} steel header was specified, to increase power between 2,000rpm {{up and the}} 7,000rpm redline. Camshaft lift and duration were eased back and the <b>torque</b> <b>curve</b> reshaped to a street-oriented peak of 5,200rpm. Project coordinator William Large built two cars for durability testing. By April 1974, the engines ran “clean” for , after which hydrocarbon curves on the first car rose far {{in excess of the}} permitted , owing to burned exhaust valves. For certification, five months’ durability miles would have to be reaccumulated.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to outline a {{multilevel}} modeling approach to fit individual angle-specific <b>torque</b> <b>curves</b> describing concentric knee extension and flexion isokinetic muscular actions in Master athletes. The potential of the analytical approach to examine between individual differences across the angle-specific <b>torque</b> <b>curves</b> was illustrated including between-individuals variation due to gender differences at a higher level. Torques in concentric muscular actions of knee extension and knee extension at 60 °·s- 1 were considered within a range of motion between 5 °and 85 ° (only torques “truly” isokinetic). Multilevel time series models with autoregressive covariance structures with standard multilevel models were superior fits compared with standard multilevel models for repeated measures to fit anglespecific <b>torque</b> <b>curves.</b> Third and fourth order polynomial models were the best fits to describe angle-specific <b>torque</b> <b>curves</b> of isokinetic knee flexion and extension concentric actions, respectively. The fixed exponents allow interpretations for initial acceleration, the angle at peak torque and the decrement of torque after peak torque. Also, the multilevel models were flexible to illustrate the influence of gender differences on the shape of torque throughout the range of motion and {{in the shape of the}} curves. The presented multilevel regression models may afford a general framework to examine angle-specific moment curves by isokinetic dynamometry, and add to the understanding mechanisms of strength development, particularly the force-length relationship, both related to performance and injury prevention...|$|R
25|$|A {{servomotor}} is a motor, {{very often}} {{sold as a}} complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system mainly control valves, such as motor-operated control valves. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended {{for use in a}} servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. <b>torque</b> <b>curve</b> is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor PM synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.|$|E
25|$|The Bullitt uses {{a version}} of the Mustang GT's {{aluminum}} 4.6L SOHC V8. It has a cold air intake, improved engine calibration, and a revised exhaust system designed to mimic the sound of the Mustang used in the Bullitt movie. Total output is 315hp (235kW) @ 6000rpm and 325lb·ft (440N·m) of torque @ 4250rpm and the engine's redline has been raised to 6500rpm (from the standard Mustang GT's 6250rpm). Premium grade, 91-octane or better gasoline is recommended, although an adaptive spark ignition system allows the engine to accept regular grade gasoline. Total output is the same with either fuel, but the engine delivers a flatter <b>torque</b> <b>curve</b> when using premium. The Tremec TR3650 5-speed manual transmission from the Mustang GT is used, but the Bullitt featured a heavier duty rear axle (also used in GT500KR) with 3.73:1 ratio, versus the Mustang GT's 3.31:1 or optional 3:55:1 ratios. The suspension is improved over the standard GT utilizing stiffer springs, struts, and a decorative front strut tower brace while also lowering the car's ride height by six millimeters. Most of the Mustang Bullitt's components are available in the aftermarket for retrofitting earlier S197 Mustang GT vehicles, but some parts used in Bullitt Mustangs are marked to show authenticity.|$|E
2500|$|Torque {{is part of}} {{the basic}} {{specification}} of an engine: the power output of an engine is expressed as its torque multiplied by its rotational speed of the axis. Internal-combustion engines produce useful torque only over a limited range of rotational speeds (typically from around 1,000–6,000 rpm for a small car). The varying torque output over that range can be [...] measured with a dynamometer, and shown as a <b>torque</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a general model is {{presented}} to describe <b>torque</b> <b>curves</b> for a thin magnetic film with two anisotropy axes. One axis is assumed to lie in {{the plane of the}} film, having first-order anisotropy only, whereas the other one, having first- and second-order anisotropy, makes an arbitrary angle with the normal to the film. Given the parameters of the model, explicit expressions can be derived for both in-plane as well as perpendicular torque measurements with an infinite magnetic field. With some restrictions analytical expressions are derived to obtain the model parameters from the Fourier coefficients of experimentally obtained <b>torque</b> <b>curves.</b> Furthermore several methods are discussed to obtain finite-field corrections, including a power series expansion in the inverse magnetic field of the Fourier coefficients. An analytical expression was also derived to determine the direction of the easy axis. The applicability of the model is tested on a metal evaporated tape and we found it gave a consistent and quite accurate description of the <b>torque</b> <b>curves</b> of such a film. With this three-dimensional model the accuracy of the determination of the material parameters increases considerably, especially for the relatively weak transverse anisotropy of the film...|$|R

2500|$|The updated VQ35HR is more {{powerful}} ( [...] at 6,800 rpm and [...] at 4,800 rpm), more fuel efficient, and more responsive than the previous VQ35DE. The [...] "HR" [...] stands for [...] "High Revolution" [...] or [...] "High Response". A dual-path intake (two air cleaners, throttle bodies, etc.) lowers intake tract restriction by 18 percent and new equal-length exhaust manifolds lead into mufflers that are 25 percent freer flowing. The intake is said to benefit from a ram-air effect adding three horsepower at 60mph. Electrically actuated variable valve timing is new on the exhaust cams which broadens the <b>torque</b> <b>curve.</b> The new engine block maintains the same bore and stroke, but the connecting rods were lengthened and the block deck was raised by 8.4mm to reduce piston side-loads. 80% of the internal components have been strengthened or redesigned to handle the increased 7,500 rpm red line, along {{with the use of}} larger crank bearings with main bearing caps reinforced by a rigid ladder-type main cap girdle. With an increase in compression ratio from 10.3:1 to 10.6:1 these changes add 26 more horsepower. Torque is down [...] from the old DE engine (268 vs. 270).
