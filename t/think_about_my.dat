Club {{gave the}} episode an A, {{calling it a}} [...] "classic" [...] and writing that it [...] "is so damn clever in how it bonds Jerry's fears about social niceties with larger fears about mortality"; he also praised Louis-Dreyfus's acting, saying that Elaine [...] "has an amusingly stark little bit of {{dialogue}} about death midway through the episode: [...] "You know, funerals always make me <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own mortality and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that!" [...] I think it's probably Louis-Dreyfus' best moment of the show so far, because she's really starting to nail Elaine's declarative, vaguely imperious, self-centered tone." [...] He also admired [...] "the estimable Barney Martin in his first appearance as Jerry's irascible dad." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 18, 2011, 4s {{release date}} in the United States was {{confirmed}} on to be June 28. On June 7, the album was leaked onto the Internet in full; Beyoncé's legal representatives issued warnings to infringing websites and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. On June 9, Beyoncé responded to the leak through Facebook, commenting, [...] "My music was leaked and while {{this is not how}} I wanted to present my new songs, I appreciate the positive response from my fans. When I record music I always <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> fans singing every note and dancing to every beat. I make music to make people happy and I appreciate that everyone has been so anxious to hear my new songs." [...] Following the leak, reports circulated that Columbia Records executives hoped to cover their assets in fear that the album may be a commercial failure. Rumors had suggested that the label requested from Beyoncé to make changes to the record and reunite Destiny's Child, claims Columbia denied. In August 2013, NME reported that Sony Music were suing a 47-year-old man from Gothenburg for US$233,000 concerning the leak of 4. The deluxe version was released simultaneously with the standard edition in several countries. In the United States, it was available exclusively through Target stores.|$|E

6000|$|... "Some day I'll {{come back}} and be your pupil," [...] Julien promised. [...] "You're a good fellow, David. You've given me {{something}} to <b>think</b> <b>about,</b> at any rate, something to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> besides <b>my</b> own misfortunes." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, when Jane Fonda asked her father how he {{prepared}} {{before going on}} stage, she was baffled by his answer, [...] "I don't know, I stand there, I <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> wife, Afdera, I don't know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keaton {{has served}} as a {{producer}} on films and television series. She produced the Fox series Pasadena that was canceled after airing only four episodes in 2001 but later completed its run on cable in 2005. In 2003, she produced the Gus Van Sant drama Elephant, about a school shooting. On why she produced the film, she said [...] "It really makes me <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> responsibilities as an adult to try and understand what's going on with young people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blanchett {{has spoken}} about {{feminism}} and politics, telling Sky News in 2013 {{that she was}} concerned that [...] "a wave of conservatism sweeping the globe" [...] was threatening women's role in society. She has also commented on the pressures women in Hollywood face now: [...] "Honestly, I <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> appearance less than I did ten years ago. People talk about {{the golden age of}} Hollywood because of how women were lit then. You could be Joan Crawford and Bette Davis and work well into your 50s, because you were lit and made into a goddess. Now, with everything being sort of gritty, women have this sense of their use-by date." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I never {{dared to}} {{encourage}} any," [...] I answered, truthfully enough. [...] "I {{knew that we}} were poor and that I should have to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> earning <b>my</b> living soon--probably as a schoolmaster." ...|$|R

2500|$|I <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> father {{being called}} ‘boy’, my uncle being called ‘boy’, my brother, {{coming back from}} Vietnam and being called ‘boy’. So I {{questioned}} myself: “What does a black man have to do before he’s given the respect as a man?” So when I was 18 years old, when I {{was old enough to}} fight and die for my country, old enough to drink, old enough to vote, I said I was old enough to be called a man. I self-ordained myself Mr. T so the first word out of everybody’s mouth is [...] "Mr." [...] That’s a sign of respect that my father didn’t get, that my brother didn’t get, that my mother didn’t get.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 May, in an {{interview}} with The Express Tribune Omar Bilal Akhtar, the lead vocalist and guitarist, informed he will go to Columbia University to obtain a degree in journalism. [...] "We achieved much more than we had ever imagined, so I'm content with what we did. Individually, of course, there's so much left to do and it'll be a challenge to do it without the band – but it's also exciting {{at the same time to}} map out a new plan. Right now it's too early to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> musical future, so I'll cross that bridge when I reach it." [...] said Omar Bilal Akhtar. Where as, Yasir Qureshi and Ali Alam said that would continue to pursue their career as musicians. On 14 May, The Express Tribune released an article about the history of the band and suggesting the band as one of the most active band's from Karachi coming to an end.|$|E

Pacquiao was ahead {{on all three}} judges' {{scorecards}} before the stoppage, with two judges scoring the fight 80–71 and the other judge scoring it at 79–72. After the bout, Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach stated, [...] "We knew we had him after the first round. He had no legs, he was hesitant and he was shot." [...] Confirming Roach's pre-fight predictions that he'd grown too old, De La Hoya crossed the ring to Pacquiao's corner after the bout was stopped and told Roach, [...] "You're right, Freddie. I don't have it anymore." [...] When asked by reporters whether he would continue fighting, De La Hoya responded, [...] "My heart still wants to fight, that's for sure," [...] De La Hoya said. [...] "But when your physical doesn't respond, what can you do? I have to be smart and make sure I <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> future plans." [...] During the first episode of the HBO 24/7 Pacquiao–Hatton series, Roach had said he saw IV marks on De La Hoya's arm, pointing out {{that he needed to}} be rehydrated surgically as a last resort.|$|E
5000|$|About Christmas Anderson said: I'll give Christmas Day 1914 a brief thought, as I {{do every}} year. And I'll <b>think</b> <b>about</b> all <b>my</b> friends who {{never made it}} home. But it's too sad to <b>think</b> too much <b>about</b> it. Far too sad.|$|R
6000|$|... “No,” Wolf Larsen answered, with an indescribable air of sadness. “And he {{is all the}} happier {{for leaving}} life alone. He is too busy living it to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>My</b> mistake was in ever opening the books.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bad enough, they say. Serves 'em right; Mrs. Raymond was as mischievous as Duncombe's wife, but I've {{not heard}} {{for the last}} two days; there's been no one to send over, and I've had enough to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> of <b>my</b> own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must finish Mrs. Pidgeon's suit first," [...] Carry answered. [...] "Next {{week will}} be time enough to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> wedding garments." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "D'you <b>think</b> that's all <b>about</b> <b>my</b> paper?" [...] Rodney inquired, after a moment's attention, with a {{distinct}} brightening of expression.|$|R
60|$|LARRY. Well, {{there was}} {{precious}} little else to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> here, <b>my</b> dear Nora, except sometimes at sunset, when one got maudlin and called Ireland Erin, and imagined one was remembering {{the days of}} old, and so forth. [He whistles Let Erin Remember].|$|R
6000|$|... "I ain't {{going to}} trouble myself with what Mother Smiley may say or <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> friends. If she don't like it, she may {{do the other}} thing. What was she herself when you first knew her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was so harrowed {{up in my}} mind {{last night}} that I didn't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> clothes at all," [...] said Anne. [...] "I'll fold them nicely tonight. They always made us do that at the asylum. Half the time, though, I'd forget, I'd be {{in such a hurry}} to get into bed nice and quiet and imagine things." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ruby {{only looked}} at me with a face full of merriment, and burst out laughing. [...] "Why, Mr. Payne," [...] she said (she had dropped that hideous prefix long ago), [...] "you've hardly known me yet a fortnight, and here you come to me with a regular declaration. How can I have had time to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> answer to such a point-blank question?" ...|$|E
60|$|When {{they had}} gone and I had stood looking after them for about a minute, I remembered I hadn't asked whether Mr. Poplington would want to take his meals here, or whether {{he would go to}} the inn for them. To be sure, she only asked me to lodge him, but as the inn is more than half a mile from here, he may want to be boarded. But this will have to be found out when he comes, and when Jone comes home {{it will have to be}} found out what he <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> taking a lodger while he's out taking a walk.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, really!' cried Mr. Pickwick, with {{manifest}} pleasure. 'Do you <b>think</b> {{they care}} <b>about</b> <b>my</b> gaiters? Do you seriously {{think that they}} identify me at all with my gaiters?' ...|$|R

60|$|There {{seems to}} be a sort of {{fatality}} in my mind leading me to put at first my statement or proposition in a wrong or awkward form. Formerly I used to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> sentences before writing them down; but for several years I have found that it saves time to scribble in a vile hand whole pages as quickly as I possibly can, contracting half the words; and then correct deliberately. Sentences thus scribbled down are often better ones than I could have written deliberately.|$|E

60|$|Times were hard. Work of {{any sort}} was {{difficult}} to get. And work {{of any sort}} was what I had to take, for I was still an unskilled labourer. I had no thought of career. That was over and done with. I had to find food for two mouths beside my own and keep a roof over our heads--yes, and buy a winter suit, my one suit being decidedly summery. I had to {{get some sort of}} work immediately. After that, when I had caught my breath, I might <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> future.|$|E
