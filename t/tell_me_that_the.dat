500|$|By July, it was {{becoming}} obvious that the ice was likely to crush the Endurance, which creaked and trembled under the pressure, and Shackleton instructed Worsley {{to be prepared to}} quickly abandon ship if the need arose. Worsley was initially incredulous, asking Shackleton: [...] "You seriously mean to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ship is doomed?" [...] Shackleton responded [...] "The ship can't live in this, Skipper." [...] Finally, on 24 October, the pressure of the ice caused the stern post of the Endurance to twist and the ship began to quickly let in water. After desperate attempts to fix the leak and pump the ship dry, Shackleton gave the order to abandon ship three days later. [...] Salvaging what essential supplies they could, the expedition set out on 30 October for Robertson Island, [...] to the northeast. After just three days, {{it was clear that the}} condition of the ice was too rough for sledging. Having travelled only a mile and a half (2.4km) from where the Endurance was sinking, they set up camp to wait for the ice to break up. Lumber and tents were salvaged from the crushed ship, which was still not fully submerged, and a reasonable camp, known as Ocean Camp, was established. [...] The expedition stayed here for two months until 23 December, when they struck camp.|$|E
500|$|Shakira was {{mindful of}} the many critics who would judge her second album, because of the [...] "phenomenon" [...] label applied to her. She knew that some would say that [...] "she had changed too much" [...] and others would reproach her if she {{remained}} the same. [...] "All I could do was to be myself. I understood that all I {{had to do was}} write the music I knew how to write and to write from the heart when I was compelled to. In that way, everything developed naturally, more so than I could have imagined", she said. In addition, Shakira insisted on perfection, working on the material to the point of exhaustion. [...] "I made two or three demos of each song. I became a human being so demanding of myself that until the song made my hair stand on end, I wouldn't stop". For the recording of Dónde Están los Ladrones? they were used old amplifiers to achieve a better sound, a German microphone with more than 40 years of existence and made several innovations in the instrumental mixes. Dónde Están los Ladrones? took nine months to produce in total, since more people worked on the album compared with her previous record. Shakira commented, [...] "To me it's a normal time, the gestation period for a baby. But many people wag their finger and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> next one cannot take so long..." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 2008 {{re-election}} bid, Thomas faced Democrat Tim Nelson. Thomas lost {{many of his}} 2004 endorsers. The Arizona Republic wrote [...] "Thomas {{simply has}} worn his intensely partisan Republican politics too boldly on his sleeve. Nowhere has that partisanship been more in evidence than in his rabid pursuit of the small fry of illegal immigration, the petty hoodlums and the traffic violators." [...] Rick Romley stated [...] "Police chiefs <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Maricopa County attorney's relationships with their police agencies are at an all-time low. And people are fearful {{that they are being}} targeted just {{because of the color of}} their skin." [...] Thomas still won the election decisively, beating Nelson by an over 7% margin.|$|E

2500|$|The first voices seeking {{compromise}} {{have started}} {{to be heard in}} Skopje. The president of the republic, Branko Crvenkovski, announced: [...] "If during the ongoing talks we can reach a rational compromise, which from the one side will defend our ethnic identity, and from the other will enable us to receive the NATO invitation, {{while at the same time}} canceling our further EU accession obstacles, then I think that this is something that must be supported, and I personally side with the supporters. Some accuse me that with my stance I am undermining the negotiating position of the Republic of Macedonia, yet I do not agree, because we are not in the beginning, but in the final phase of the negotiations. The one who will <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> price is high, is obliged to address the public opinion and announce an alternative scenario on how Macedonia will develop in the next ten to fifteen years." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{southern}} {{portion of}} SK Hwy 35 from the Canada–United States border to Weyburn forms the initial {{segment of the}} CanAm Highway. [...] The terrain is mixed prairie featuring rolling moraines and valleys. [...] North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA super corridors are a concept of huge transportation corridors connecting Mexico, United States, and Canada. [...] The CanAm highway was a concept begun in the 1920s. This area has been subject to criticism as the entry way to Canada of this route. [...] "The CanAm matters so little to Saskatchewan highway planners that they've turned the most southern part of it within the province -- the Highway 35 link from Weyburn to the little U.S. border crossing at Oungre -- to gravel. SK Hwy 35 achieved a dishonorable mention in the Canadian contest entitled 'Highways from Hell'. [...] "Brenda Bakken Lackey called Highway 35 an “embarrassment’’ and a hazard for truckers’ business since it {{was turned into a}} gravel roadway last year. [...] 'When it rains, there is mud and when it is dry, there is flying dust and gravel,' she said. 'Truckers from my constituency <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Customs officials say {{they are not going to}} put up with the mud that is coming across on the trucks. There is also concerns about grain seeds and weeds coming across in the mud on truck tires.'...Highway Minister Maynard Sonntag said. 'Highway No. 6 has a much higher traffic count, many more trucks in and out from the States than Highway No. 35 would have.’' [...] " [...] "The projects on Highways 39 and 6 will help to improve traffic flow through these Canada/U.S. ports. 'Highways 6 and 39 are very important to Saskatchewan – serving as tourism links and major north-south trade corridors to the U.S.,' Sonntag said. [...] "Highway 35 from Wadena South is always an adventure. I have found my driving skills have improved immensely especially when it comes to emergency braking and swerving to avoid the many areas of broken pavement. This past spring the Dept. of Highways could have saved thousands in signage costs if they only had put up warning signs where the road was smooth and unbroken." [...] The regional parks in this area are Nickle Lake, Mainprize, and Oungre Memorial as well as the Rafferty Reservoir.|$|E
