5|$|A scapula (shoulder blade), only {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Plesiorycteropus, has the acromion, a process, present, but {{the structure is}} probably not as large as in aardvarks or armadillos. Six humeri have been found; the bone is robust and an entepicondylar foramen is present in <b>the</b> <b>distal</b> (far) end. There are three examples of the radius, a compact and massive bone in Plesiorycteropus which resembles the pangolin radius. The three known ulnae show that the olecranon process at the proximal (near) end is well-developed, but <b>the</b> <b>distal</b> end is narrow; the morphology of the bone suggests that the animal was capable of producing much force with its arms.|$|E

5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Transandinomys talamancae has a complex penis, with <b>the</b> <b>distal</b> (far) end of the baculum (penis bone) ending in a structure consisting of three digits.

The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, but there is a broad band of nonspinous tissue.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is similar to}} several syndromes that share its features. Brachydactyly of <b>the</b> <b>distal</b> phalanges, sensorineural deafness and pulmonary stenosis are common with Keutel syndrome. In Muenke syndrome, developmental delay, distal brachydactyly and sensorineural hearing loss are reported; features of Teunissen-Cremers syndrome include nasal aberrations and broadness of the thumbs and big toes, also with brachydactyly. Broad thumbs and big toes are primary characteristics of Rubinstein syndrome.|$|E

5|$|Several {{anomalies}} {{affecting the}} digits (fingers and toes) {{have been observed}} with the syndrome. A broadening of the thumbs and big toes (halluces) was reported in two brothers. The broadening was apparent in all distal phalanges of the fingers, although the pinkies were unaffected yet appeared to be clinodactylic (warped, or bent toward the other fingers). Additional eports described this broadness of the thumbs and big toes, with brachydactyly (shortness) in <b>the</b> <b>distal</b> phalanges of the other digits except the pinkies in affected individuals. On X-rays of a two-year-old boy with the disorder, the brachydactyly was shown {{to be caused by}} shortening of epiphyses (joint-ends) of <b>the</b> <b>distal</b> phalanges. The broadness and brachydactyly of the big toes in particular may give them a stunted, rounded and stub-like appearance.|$|E
5|$|The King Island emu and the {{mainland}} emu show few morphological differences {{other than their}} significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of {{the mainland}} emu, yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the culmen, whereas it was four times longer in the mainland emu. Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland emu have previously been suggested to be <b>the</b> <b>distal</b> foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the cranium. However, <b>the</b> <b>distal</b> foramen is known to be variable in the mainland emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The same is true of the contour of the cranium, which is more dome-shaped in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} {{produces}} aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, {{which is important}} in the regulation of salt ("mineral") balance and blood volume. In the kidneys, aldosterone acts on <b>the</b> <b>distal</b> convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates. Sodium retention is also a response of <b>the</b> <b>distal</b> colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Angiotensin II and extracellular potassium are the two main regulators of aldosterone production. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Therefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure.|$|E

5|$|The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in {{all members}} of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen (opening) {{perforates}} <b>the</b> <b>distal</b> (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone). The pelvis and the bones of the hindlimbs are heavily built.

5|$|The holotype FMNH PR1821 is {{the only}} fully {{described}} specimen of Cryolophosaurus. The specimen consists of an incomplete skull and mandibles lacking most of their front half; nine maxillary teeth; a fragmentary sixth cervical centrum; cervical vertebrae 7-10; several posterior cervical ribs; several anterior dorsal vertebrae; most mid and posterior dorsal vertebrae; several dorsal ribs; the fifth sacral vertebrae; three chevrons; many partial and complete caudal vertebrae and centra; two partial humeri; a proximal radius; a proximal ulna; a partial ilium; a proximal pubis; both ischia, but only one distal; two incomplete femora; <b>the</b> <b>distal</b> end of a tibia; <b>the</b> <b>distal</b> end of a fibula, and the astragalus and calcaneum.

5|$|The median plates (m, m') {{are also}} sclerites {{that are not}} so {{definitely}} differentiated as specific plates as are the three principal axillaries, but nevertheless they are important elements of the flexor apparatus. They lie in the median area of the wing base distal to {{the second and third}} axillaries and are separated from each other by an oblique line (bf) which forms a prominent convex fold during flexion of the wing. The proximal plate (m) is usually attached to <b>the</b> <b>distal</b> arm of the third axillary and perhaps should be regarded {{as a part of the}} latter. <b>The</b> <b>distal</b> plate (m') is less constantly present as a distinct sclerite and may be represented by a general sclerotization of the base of the mediocubital field of the wing. When the veins of this region are distinct at their bases, they are associated with the outer median plate.|$|E

40|$|Mature maize leaves {{have defined}} cell types along <b>the</b> {{proximal}} <b>distal</b> and medial lateral axes. The patterning events that establish these axes take place early in leaf initiation. We {{have identified a}} new dominant mutation, Wavy auricle in blade 1 (Wab 1), which affects patterning in both axes in a dose-dependent manner. Wab 1 leaves are narrower than normal leaves and displace proximal tissues distally. We show that <b>the</b> proximal <b>distal</b> patterning defects are not due to misexpression of knox genes. Genetic analyses suggest that the action of dominant Wab 1 alleles is localized to a lateral domain of the leaf, located between the midvein and the marginal domain that is determined by narrow sheath function. Thus, Wab 1 defines a knox-independent pathway that affects specification of <b>the</b> proximal <b>distal</b> axis of <b>the</b> maize leaf. We suggest that failure to elaborate a normal lateral domain in the Wab 1 leaf is responsible for disrupting patterning of <b>the</b> proximal <b>distal</b> axis...|$|R

5|$|An air-cuticle {{multilayer}} in {{the scales}} creates optical interference.

5|$|Frank was autopsied twice, {{the second}} time to recover debris {{embedded}} in his body.

5|$|Many of the {{features}} found in sauropods that basal sauropodomorphs lack {{are related to the}} change in body size. The greatest regions affected by this are the hind limbs and pelvis. For example, an elongating of the ilium, size reduction of the lesser trochanter shelf, and semiplantigrade posture are some features that indicate the amount and positioning of leg muscles being modified. Vulcanodon possessed these features, the latter of which is seen earliest in it. However, Vulcanodon does not have reduced distal phalanges, which are seen in Shunosaurus and all more derived sauropods. This means that while the muscle positioning of its legs were changing, they had not yet reduced in <b>the</b> <b>distal</b> region of the limb.|$|E
5|$|Nine days later, {{he checked}} into Methodist Hospital in Houston {{for a series}} of {{physical}} and psychological tests to determine the cause of his mysterious arm problems.

Richard's blood pressure in his left arm was normal but pressure was nearly absent in his right arm due to the completely obstructed artery.
