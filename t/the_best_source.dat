The German nuclear physicist Siegfried Flügge published two influential articles on the exploitation of nuclear energy in 1939.

25|$|In 1623, {{the prince}} angered the Ottomans {{by refusing to}} allow an army on its {{way back from the}} Persian front to winter in the Bekaa.

25|$|The surgeon replaces missing {{parts with}} tissue of like quality and quantity; nasal lining with mucosa, {{cartilage}} with cartilage, bone with bone, and skin with skin that best match the native skin color and skin {{texture of the}} damaged nasal subunit. For such surgical repairs, skin flaps are preferable to skin grafts, because skin flaps generally are the superior remedy for matching the color and the texture of nasal skin, better resist tissue contracture, and provide better vascularisation of the nasal skeleton; thus, when there is sufficient skin to allow tissue harvesting, nasal skin is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>source</b> of nasal skin. Furthermore, despite its notable scarring propensity, the nasal skin flap is the prime consideration for nasal reconstruction, because of its greater verisimilitude.|$|E

25|$|The {{light source}} {{to be used}} should be small and bright. The best shadows come from light {{proceeding}} from the smallest possible point. Albert Almoznino suggests a candle, a flashlight (with the lens and reflector removed) or any very small light. If a bulb is used, it should be clear. J. C. Cannell suggests in his book, Modern Conjuring For Amateurs, that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>source</b> of light is the electric arc, which Almoznino agrees to the small arc lamp, and the second best being the limelight (if used with a high-class jet). Trewey suggests the chalk for the limelight to be cut in a triangular form, or else it will produce a gray border around the shadow. Cannell states another favorite amongst shadowgraphists {{is the use of}} acetylene gas (i.e. acetylene gas lamp or carbide lamp). Nowadays it is possible to use a single lensless (for example, SMD) LED.|$|E
25|$|During {{his studies}} on the Galápagos Islands, Charles Darwin {{observed}} 13 species of finches that are closely related and differ most markedly {{in the shape of}} their beaks. The beak of each species is suited to the food available in its particular environment, suggesting that beak shapes evolved by natural selection. Large beaks were found on the islands where the primary source of food for the finches are nuts and therefore the large beaks allowed the birds to be better equipped for opening the nuts and staying well nourished. Slender beaks were found on the finches which found insects to be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>source</b> of food on the island they inhabited; their slender beaks allowed the birds to be better equipped for pulling out the insects from their tiny hiding places. The finch is also found on the mainland and it is thought that they migrated to the islands and began adapting to their environment through natural selection.|$|E

500|$|The Historia Augusta is {{considered}} by historians as the least trustworthy for all accounts of events, historiography, and biographies among the ancient works and is full of fabricated materials and sources. The works of Herodian of Antioch are, by comparison, [...] "far less fantastic" [...] than the stories presented by the Historia Augusta. Historian Andrew G. Scott suggests that Dio's work is frequently considered <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>source</b> for this period. However, Doctor and Professor Clare Rowan questions Dio's accuracy {{on the topic of}} Caracalla, referring to the work as having presented a hostile attitude towards Caracalla and thus needing to be treated with caution. An example of this hostility is found in one section where Dio notes that Caracalla is descended from three different races and that he managed to combine all of their faults into one person: the fickleness, cowardice, and recklessness of the Gallic, the cruelty and harshness of the Africans, and the craftiness that is associated with the Syrians. Despite this, the outline of events as presented by Dio are described by Rowan as generally accurate, while the motivations that Dio suggests are of questionable origin. An example of this is his presentation of the Edict of Caracalla; the motive that Dio appends to this event is Caracalla's desire to increase tax revenue. Doctors Olivier Hekster, Nicholas Zair, and Rowan challenge this presentation because the majority of people who were enfranchised by the edict would have been poor. In her work, Rowan also describes Herodian's depiction of Caracalla: more akin to a soldier than an emperor.|$|E
