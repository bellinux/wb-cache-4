With the story over, the family gets up to finish the Seder only to see the wind blow <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>shut,</b> locking them all in. Boris decides to tell them another story, which Chas at first thinks is about how the Hebrews wandered the desert for forty years before finally reaching the Promised Land.

5|$|To {{sequester}} Clayton {{from the}} {{affairs in the}} state, the Brindles and the Democrats decided {{the only thing they}} could do was elect him to the US Senate. However, even though he won unanimously, he refused to take his seat, which would mean letting Johnson become governor. In 1871, the state House of Representatives drafted articles of impeachment against Clayton, charging him {{with a wide variety of}} impeachable actions, including depriving Johnson and several other state officials of offices to which they had been fairly elected, removing state officials and judges from offices to which they had been fairly elected, aiding in fraudulent elections, taking bribes for state railroad bonds, and various other high crimes and misdemeanors. The members of the House then tried to suspend Clayton from his duties as governor by force. They even apparently tried locking him in his office and nailing <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>shut.</b> However, Clayton responded that they had no right by the state constitution to deprive him of his office. At the same time, the House also brought impeachment charges against Chief Justice John McClure for his part in trying to deny Johnson the privileges of his office of lieutenant governor.|$|E
25|$|According to Wilferd Madelung, after Abu Bakr's {{election}} {{he and a}} {{few other}} companions went to Fatimah's house to receive homage from Ali and his supporters gathered there. When Umar threatened to set the house ablaze unless they came out, Zubayr came out with his sword drawn. He lost his sword, and Umar's men carried him off. Evidence exists that Fatimah's house was searched, and Ali reportedly said that if he had been forty men he would have resisted. Abu Bakr isolated the Banu Hashim (who, according to Al-Zuhri, refused to swear allegiance) for six months. According to Lesley Hazleton, Umar decided to break into Fatima's house instead of burning it and flung himself at the door. Twelver Shi'ite sources relate that Umar set fire to Fatimah's door before kicking it open, crushing Fatimah (who was trying to hold <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>shut).</b> The blow killed Mohsin, Fatimah's unborn son, broke her ribs and later caused her death). This is disputed by Sunni Muslims, who believe that no such conflict ever occurred. Twelvers believe that Ali, under orders from Muhammad not to fight back, was put in chains; when Abu Bakr's selection to the caliphate was a fait accompli, Ali withheld his allegiance until after Fatimah's death because {{he did not want to}} cause strife in the nascent Muslim community. He buried Fatimah at night, with none of Abu Bakr's supporters present, and the location of her grave is uncertain.|$|E

500|$|Finally in space, Homer reveals he has smuggled {{potato chips}} on board. He opens the bag, but is unaware that, {{due to the}} effects of weightlessness, they will spread around and clog the instruments. His {{appetite}} seems to save the day as he floats after the chips, eating them, but he manages to fly into an experimental ant farm, letting the ants loose in the shuttle. James Taylor comes in over the radio to sing [...] "You've Got a Friend", but the disaster continues on board as the ants destroy the navigation system. James Taylor suggests that they blow the bugs out the front hatch, which the astronauts do, but Homer fails to put on his harness and is nearly blown out of the open hatch before grabbing its handle and clinging for life. Buzz pulls him inside, but due to the vacuum's sheer force, Homer bends the hatch handle, preventing the door from closing and potentially resulting in the shuttle's destruction on re-entry. When Race declares he will attack Homer in frustration, Homer pulls a rod out of the wall to defend himself, and he inadvertently uses it to seal <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>shut.</b> With the problems solved, the shuttle successfully returns to Earth, making a convenient crash-landing through the roof of a press reporters' convention.|$|E

The {{struggle}} gets Tapp's attention, and he saves Alison and Diana and chases Zep to the sewers, where he is eventually shot in the chest during a struggle. Lawrence, aware only of gunshots and screaming, is electrically shocked as well and loses reach of the phone; in desperation, he saws off his foot and shoots Adam with the corpse's revolver. Zep enters the bathroom to kill Lawrence, stating that [...] "It's the rules", but Adam, who suffered only a flesh wound, overpowers Zep and bludgeons him to death with the toilet cover. As Lawrence crawls {{out of the room}} to find help, Adam searches Zep's body for a key and finds another microcassette recorder, which reveals that Zep was another victim, following the rules of his own game to obtain an antidote for a slow-acting poison in his body. As the tape ends, the [...] "corpse" [...] rises and is revealed to be Lawrence's patient John, the real Jigsaw killer. He reveals that the key to Adam's chain was in the bathtub he woke up in, which was drained when Adam awoke. Adam attempts to shoot John with Zep's gun, but John activates a remote, briefly electrocuting Adam. John shuts off the lights, while Adam screams in terror as John slams <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>shut,</b> leaving him to die.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Brian {{has been}} out of town {{attending}} a seminar on creating a web series and is unaware of what has transpired. On his way home, Brian stops at the Marriott, meets Ida, and starts having drinks with her. Quickly bonding, they retire to Ida's room for sex, with Ida leaving first, then Brian after telling the barman to bill the drinks to her room. The next morning, Brian shares his newfound love with Peter and Lois before showing them a picture of Ida on his cellphone. Peter and Lois go into hysterics, while Brian, unaware of Ida's operation, believes they are just jealous. After Stewie tells him that Quagmire's father has had a sex change and reveals Ida's name, Brian realizes that he has had sex with Quagmire's transgendered father and vomits for almost 30 uninterrupted seconds before the two of them panic. At the same time, Ida returns to Quagmire's home and apologizes, and Quagmire returns the favor, reconciling their relationship. Ida tells Quagmire that she met someone, and when she says it was Brian, whom Quagmire despises, he becomes furious. Brian is traumatized for no reason after finding out about Ida and, when he hears Quagmire come inside the house, he tries to hide under Peter and Lois' bed, but Quagmire finds him easily, because Brian's feet were sticking out from under the bed, and brutally beats him, thus threatening to blow his head off if he goes near Quagmire's house.

500|$|An {{early morning}} {{kick-off}} away to fierce rivals Liverpool {{ended in a}} routine victory for United. Losing to Juventus in the last match of the Champions League before hiatus had {{seemed to have no}} effect on United's domestic dominance. They comprehensively defeated Aston Villa thanks to a solitary Giggs goal and followed it up with a heroic Schmeichel performance to deny Newcastle United at St James' Park. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a lifelong fan of the Geordies, was among the crowd and was in awe over Ferguson's team, believing that the manager had assembled [...] "one of the greatest sides of the century". Two out of two became three as Everton found no answer to deny the league leaders, who extended their lead {{at the top of the}} table to six points on Boxing Day. The win marked the end of Karel Poborský's spell, coming on for David Beckham in the second half ahead of a switch to Graeme Souness' Benfica. However, what was to come at the end of December exemplified the vulnerability of the defence during the second half of the season. In losing to mid-table Coventry City two days after the Everton win, United blew the chance to open up a nine-point lead at the top of the table, which would virtually slam <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>shut</b> on the challengers. They again found themselves a goal down, this time courtesy of Noel Whelan, Solskjær and Sheringham responded to restore the advantage back on the champions but a Dion Dublin penalty and mazy run from youngster Darren Huckerby in the last minute ensured an implausible victory, given the fact that Coventry were 2–1 down with five minutes to go. Prior to the game, Ferguson highlighted the fact that the league [...] "wasn't won in December", but following the defeat blasted his side's display as [...] "silly" [...] and [...] "on the verge of complacency".|$|E
500|$|The {{main event}} was the Extreme Elimination Chamber for the ECW World Championship. After a segment {{earlier in the}} event showed an injured Sabu was unable {{to compete in the}} match, it was decided that Hardcore Holly would take his spot in the ECW Championship match. Before the match began, Paul Heyman {{announced}} the rules of the match and [...] explained that each superstar had a weapon with them in each of their pods. Before entering the ring, Heyman had a conversation backstage with Big Show, that was unseen by television viewers, with him revealing {{that for the first time}} in his professional career he was not motivated to give the promo. Rob Van Dam and Hardcore Holly were the first superstars to begin the match and one of the other four competitors were then released from their pod every five minutes afterward. The first person to be released from his pod was CM Punk, who entered the match with a steel chair in hand. Test then followed, five minutes after him, with a crowbar. Punk was the first eliminated from the match, after Van Dam performed a Five Star Frog Splash from the top turnbuckle and covered him for the 3-count. Moments later, Test charged and delivered a big boot to Holly, eliminating him. Van Dam was the third person eliminated, after Test delivered a diving elbow drop from the top of a pod and pinned him. When it was Bobby Lashley's turn, his pod wouldn't open, he could not exit it because Heyman's Security Force had bolted <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>shut.</b> Lashley then used the table that was with him to smash through the pod, allowing him to escape. He then delivered a spear to Test to eliminate him. Big Show, was the final man to exit his pod and had a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire in tow. Lashley was able to block Big Show's swing of the barbed wire bat with a folding chair and then threw him into the pod, causing him to bleed. Lashley managed to reverse a chokeslam into a DDT and then delivered a spear to win the match and become the new ECW Champion.|$|E

2500|$|A {{wide range}} of spiders are known as [...] "trapdoor spiders". [...] These spiders {{excavate}} a burrow and seal the entrance with a web trapdoor hinged on one side with silk. The most well-known door is the “cork”-type, which is thick and beveled to precisely fit the opening. The other is the “wafer”-type door, a more simple sheet of silk and dirt. The top of the door is usually camouflaged with bits of debris such as twigs and rock, making {{it very difficult to}} detect. The spider spins silk fishing lines, or trip wires, that radiate out of the burrow entrance. [...] When the spider is using the trap to capture prey, its chelicerae hold <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>shut</b> on the end furthest from the hinge.
