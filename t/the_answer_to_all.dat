500|$|The ninth track [...] "The Hook Up" [...] has a reggae {{feel and}} {{features}} Spears {{singing in a}} Jamaican Patois accent. The ballad [...] "Shadow" [...] talks about how reminders of a lover can still linger after he’s gone. [...] "Brave New Girl" [...] lyrics talk about a young woman finding her passion and losing inhibitions. Backed by choppy, electro-funk beats, she sings in a bouncy near-rap, [...] "She's gonna pack her bags, she's going to find her way, she's going to get right out of this/ She don't want New York, she don't want L.A., she's {{going to find that}} special kiss." [...] The song incorporates elements of the music of No Doubt, Blondie and Madonna. [...] "Everytime" [...] begins with a piano introduction accompanying Spears's breathy vocals, which build from soft to strong throughout the song. [...] "Everytime" [...] lyrics are a plea for forgiveness for inadvertently hurting a former lover. In the song, the singer explains she feels unable to continue in lines such as [...] "Everytime I try to fly I fall / Without my wings I feel so small". During an interview with MTV, Spears said about the song, [...] "It's about heartbreak, it's about your first love, your first true love. That's something all people can relate to, because you all have that first love that you think you're going to be with the rest of your life." [...] When asked if [...] "Everytime" [...] was about Timberlake, she responded [...] "I'll let the song speak for itself." [...] The Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] removes the original melody of the song and adds a clattering backbeat and Punjabi shouts. In [...] "The Answer", Spears sings that her lover is <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> her needs: [...] "Who can hold me tight, keep me warm through the night? / Who can wipe my tears when it's wrong, make it right? / Who can give me love till I'm satisfied? / Who's the one I need in my life?". In [...] "Don't Hang Up", she pleads on the phone for her lover to keep her satisfied long-distance.|$|E

[...] On July 4, 1870, he said: [...] "Senators undertake to disturb us... by reminding us of the possibility of large numbers swarming from China; but <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> this is very obvious and very simple. If the Chinese come here, they will come for citizenship or merely for labor. [...] If they come for citizenship, then in this desire do they give a pledge of loyalty to our institutions; and where is the peril in such vows? [...] They are peaceful and industrious; how can their citizenship be the occasion of solicitude?" [...] He accused legislators promoting anti-Chinese legislation of betraying the principles of the Declaration of Independence: [...] "Worse than any heathen or pagan abroad are those in our midst who are false to our institutions." [...] Sumner's bill failed, and from 1870 to 1943, and in some cases as late as 1952, Chinese and other Asians were ineligible for naturalized U.S. citizenship.|$|E

2500|$|Mixers, {{disturbed}} by the edicts of the PSC having so much influence in their daily practice, created the American Chiropractic Association (one of the early precursors to today's ACA). Though born out of necessity to defend against the UCA attacks, the ACA's stated purposes were to advance education and research for chiropractic. Its growth was initially stunted by its resolution to recognize physio-therapy and other modalities as pertaining to chiropractic. What growth did occur was credited to its second president, Frank R. Margetts, DC with support from his alma mater, National Chiropractic College. He insisted that no college administrator could hold an official position in the association, giving doctors in the field a collective voice. But a disagreement within the UCA in 1924 turned the tide for the ACA. B.J. was still working to purge mixers from practicing chiropractic, and he saw a new invention by Dossa D. Evans, the [...] "Neurocalometer" [...] (NCM), as <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> of straight chiropractic's (and particularly PSC's) legal and financial problems. As {{the owner of the}} patent on the NCM, he planned {{to limit the number of}} NCMs to 5000 and lease them only to graduates of the Palmer related schools who were members of the UCA. He then claimed that the NCM was the only way to accurately locate subluxations, preventing over 20,000 mixers from being able to defend their method of practice.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (a {{think tank}} founded by [...] "a {{small group of}} visionary Americans {{committed}} to advancing U.S. interests in the Middle East") argued that the U.S.-Israel relationship is [...] "A Strategic Asset for the United States." [...] In discussing their report, Walter B. Slocombe said that while in the popular imagination, the U.S.-Israel relationship is only good for Israel, Israel provides enormous assistance to the United States, including military expertise which has saved American lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. [...] Robert D. Blackwill countered {{the claim that the}} U.S.-Israel relationship significantly damages the relationship between the United States and the Arab world. [...] He asked rhetorically: [...] "Would Saudi Arabia's policies toward the United States be markedly different in practice if Washington entered into a sustained crisis with Israel over the Palestine issue during which the bilateral relationship between the United States and Israel went into steep, systemic decline? In that instance, would Riyadh lower the price of oil? Would it stop hedging its regional bets concerning U.S. attempts to coerce Iran into freezing its nuclear weapons program? Would it regard U.S. policy toward Afghanistan any less critically? Would it view American democracy promotion in the Middle East more favorably? Would it be more inclined to reform its internal governmental processes to be more in line with U.S. preferences? Walt [...] and I judge <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> these questions [...] 'No.'" [...] When asked how this report could so flatly contradict the Walt and Mearsheimer thesis, Slocombe responded, [...] "There is so much error in the world," [...] and added, [...] "I think {{it would be interesting to}} ask them whether they make the same contrary argument about the other countries to whom we also provide something like this kind of support.

6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> {{this seems}} to be ready enough. The judgment, whether cruel or tender, should not be ill-judgment.

On the two latter, we will say at once, that if it be argued, as it often is, that the reason of our modern poetical obscurity and vagueness lies in the greater depth of the questions which are now agitating thoughtful minds, we do utterly deny it. Human nature, human temptations, human problems, are radically the same in every age, by whatsoever outward difference of words they may seem distinguished. Where is deeper philosophic thought, true or false, expressed in verse, than in Dante, or in Spenser's two cantos of [...] "Mutabilities"? Yet if they are difficult to understand, their darkness is that of the deep blue sea. Vague they never are, obscure they never are, because they see clearly what they want to say, and how to say it.

'Viewed indeed {{from that}} {{position}} which {{was occupied by}} ancient philosophers, the existing contrarieties between nations might well appear inexplicable, and intellectual powers {{might seem to be}} the exclusive heritage of particular nations. But Christianity leads us to distinguish between the nature of man as he came fresh from the hands of his Creator, and that natural propensity to sin which he has inherited in consequence of his fall from original innocence. It teaches that as God has [...] "made of one blood all nations to dwell together {{on the face of the}} whole earth," [...] and has given in virtue of this common origin one common nature destined to be pure and holy and divine, so, by virtue of Redemption and Regeneration, the image of God may be restored in all, and whatever is the result of his depravity therefore may be overcome. And this seems to be <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> statements relating to the want of capacity in certain nations of the earth for the reception of Divine Truth, that every man, because he is a man, because he is a partaker of that very nature which has been taken into the Person of the Son of God, may by the grace of God be awakened to the sense of his true life, of his real dignity as a redeemed brother of Christ.|$|E
