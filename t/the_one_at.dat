5|$|A {{water mill}} and Mill Hill were {{mentioned}} in a grant in 1544. Water power was in general use in Rivington and many houses including the hall had water-mills. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> {{the hall was}} once used to churn butter. The foundations of {{what could have been}} a mill opposite Mill Hill Cottages on Rivington Lane, mill ponds, and a smithy were shown on the 1848 first edition Ordnance Survey map. Names such as Mill Hill and Mill Dam Wood also provide evidence of the former mill.|$|E

5|$|After this NSS {{decided not}} to obtain many {{additional}} restaurants, as it did not see value in such a strategy. From 1930 through 1934 the company took over restaurants at Ål, Jaren, Lillestrøm and Tønsberg, along with dining service on the steamship Skibladner, which ran on Mjøsa. During {{the first half of}} the 1940s it again acquired new restaurants, including <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> Kristiansand Station. In 1940 and 1941 the company made a solid profit, but lack of food from 1942 onwards transformed the profit to a loss. During the late 1940s NSS also took over the restaurants at Drammen and Sarpsborg, as well as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> Oslo Airport, Fornebu.|$|E
5|$|Bastille Day, {{a celebration}} of the {{storming}} of the Bastille in 1789, the biggest festival in the city, is a military parade taking place every year on 14 July on the Champs-Élysées, from the Arc de Triomphe to Place de la Concorde. It includes a flypast over the Champs Élysées by the Patrouille de France, a parade of military units and equipment, and a display of fireworks in the evening, the most spectacular being <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> the Eiffel Tower.|$|E

50|$|<b>One</b> of <b>the</b> most {{important}} mints {{was located in}} the province of Georgia, in Tiflis. In the years 1682-1685, the only Safavid mints that were recorded to have some activity were <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>at</b> Tiflis and Tabriz. The mint <b>at</b> Tiflis was <b>one</b> of <b>the</b> few mints, alongside <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>at</b> Tabriz and Yerevan, where also reminting took place. In the 17th century, it was <b>one</b> of <b>the</b> most used Safavid mints.|$|R
5|$|Bruce's {{new house}} was {{complete}} by 1699, and was worked on {{by many of}} the same craftsmen who were engaged by Bruce at nearby Hopetoun House, which was under construction at the same time. Craftsmen included the plasterers John McKay and Thomas Albur, cabinet maker William Scott, plumber Joseph Foster, smith Alexander Gardener, and the wright Andrew Barclay. The staircase, with its wrought-iron balustrade decorated with roses, thistles, tulips and oak leaves, bears many similarities to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> Caroline Park, Granton, and was the work of the smiths James Storrie and James Horne.|$|E
5|$|Butlin's funfair and {{amusement}} park business continued {{to expand into}} the post-war period.

5|$|I {{would hold}} that {{officers}} {{must have some}} level of particularized suspicion in order to conduct a seizure and search like <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> issue here, because (1) seizing one’s personal property deprives the individual of his valid possessory interest in his property, and (2) authorizing a generalized computer forensic search (untethered to any particularized suspicion) permits the Government {{to engage in the}} type of generalized fishing expeditions that the Fourth Amendment is designed to prevent.|$|E
5|$|In September 1918, Holden {{transferred}} to the Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) with the new rank of major. From 1918 until 1928 he worked on 69 Commission cemeteries. Initially, Holden ran the drawing office and worked as the senior design architect under the three principal architects in France and Belgium (Edwin Lutyens, Reginald Blomfield and Herbert Baker). Holden worked on the experimental war cemetery at Louvencourt and, according to Geurst and Karol, probably on <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> Forceville that {{was selected as the}} prototype for all that followed.|$|E
5|$|MACN Pv-RN 975, a {{fragment}} of the mandible (lower jaw) preserving one premolar, was discovered in 1991 and tentatively identified as Ferugliotherium by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996, but this assignment remains controversial. The poorly preserved and worn premolar is a bladelike tooth, resembling multituberculate fourth lower premolars (p4). The premolar is 4.8mm long and bears eight faint ridges on both the labial (towards the lips) and lingual (towards the tongue) sides. On the labial side, the four ridges at the back are more widely separated than the four in front of them. The back and front margins of the tooth are parallel {{and there is no}} small cusp on the labial side. There are two roots; <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> the front is larger than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> the back and bears a furrow. The lower border of the enamel cover is marked by two semicircular extensions of the enamel on the front side, but there is only one such extension at the back. By its size, the number of ridges, and apparently greater length than height, it differs from all known multituberculate first, second, and third lower premolars, indicating that it is a p4.|$|E

50|$|The inn has {{two floors}} {{and a more}} or less square shape; its {{dimensions}} are 50.67 m by 45.25 m. There is a large inner courtyard which is surrounded by the rooms that have colonnades with cross vaults in front. There are 68 rooms in both floors, with <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground floor being historically used for commerce and <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first floor historically used for accommodation. There are also 10 one-storey shops behind the colonnade at the eastern entrance.|$|R
5|$|On 13–14 November, Ferdinand of Bavaria (Ernst's brother) and the Count of Arenberg {{took the}} Elector's castle at Poppelsdorf; on 18 November, {{they moved to}} attack the Godesburg. This {{fortress}} was considerably stronger than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> Poppelsdorf and of supreme strategic importance for the projected attack on Bonn, {{the capital city of}} the Electorate.|$|E
5|$|Other portraits {{include one}} by William Nicholson dating from 1814 in which Bewick sits {{with a pencil}} {{in his hand and}} a dog beside his chair; <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> his birthplace; and the {{full-length}} seated portrait of 1827 by Thomas Sword Good (see above). Another painting by Sword in the National Portrait Gallery is now no longer thought to be of Bewick. An unsigned painting supposedly of him in the Yale Center for British Art is equally dubious.|$|E
5|$|Renewed {{tension between}} Britain and France in the 1840s {{led to a}} {{modernisation}} of some of Britain's coastal defences. The batteries at Shornemead and Coalhouse Point were reinstated and upgraded, though <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> Lower Hope Point was never restored. In {{the case of the}} Coalhouse battery, it was substantially expanded between 1847 and 1855 to convert it into a fort. The work was slow as the marshy ground caused the foundations to crack and the structure to subside, and the contractor was unsatisfactory.|$|E
50|$|There are six inflows.

5|$|The cheekteeth {{increase}} {{regularly in}} size from front to back. They all consist of a large central basin surrounded by cusps and crests. The basins are deeper than in Palaeosciurus and Ratufa obtusidens and lack crenulations in the enamel, which distinguishes them from another fossil squirrel, Albanensia. The first cheekteeth, p4, is large and about triangular in form, short and quite broad at the back. The two cusps at the front, the protoconid and metaconid, are isolated from each other. In front of the metaconid, {{there is a small}} cuspule, an anteroconid, at the lingual side of the tooth (the side of the tongue). The central basin of the tooth is relatively deep. At the back of the tooth, the entoconid cusp is connected to the posterolophid, a crest that forms the back margin. Of the two roots, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> the front is round and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> the back is broad.|$|E
5|$|The {{rulers of}} the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650BC) {{continued}} building pyramids and their associated complexes. The rare remains from Middle Kingdom temples, like <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> Medinet Madi, show that temple plans grew more symmetrical during that period, and divine temples made increasing use of stone. The pattern of a sanctuary lying behind a pillared hall frequently appears in Middle Kingdom temples, and sometimes these two elements are fronted by open courts, foreshadowing the standard temple layout used in later times.|$|E
