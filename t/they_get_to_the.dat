5|$|Another change made in Emerald is the {{addition}} of Team Magma's base {{on the side of}} Mt. Chimney; moreover, the legendary Pokémon Groudon is found here, rather than in the Cave of Origin. Even though the locations of the legendary Pokémon are different, Team Magma still makes the mistake of taking the blue orb to Groudon, while Team Aqua still makes the mistake of taking the red orb to Kyogre. A new character named Scott is also introduced in this game. Unknown to the player, he is the creator of the Battle Frontier. He follows the player throughout the game, watching them battle each Gym Leader and even meeting up with them when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Battle Frontier.|$|E
5|$|Batman, Robin and Batgirl {{decide to}} go after Freeze together. By the time <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{observatory}} where Freeze and Bane are, Gotham is completely frozen. Batgirl and Robin are attacked by Bane. They eventually defeat him by kicking apart his venom tubes, stopping the flow of venom to his body. Bane collapses before transforming back to his original diminutive size of Antonio Diego and is left helpless on the ground. Meanwhile Batman and Freeze begin to fight each other, with Batman defeating Freeze. Batgirl and Robin manage to unfreeze Gotham; and Batman shows Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl. Freeze learns that Ivy has betrayed him {{over the death of}} wife. Ivy blamed Batman for Nora's death, but she informs Batgirl that it was her idea. Freeze is angered by the betrayal and is informed by Batman that his wife is not dead; she is restored in cryogenic slumber and has been moved to Arkham waiting for him to finish his research. Batman proceeds to ask Freeze for the cure Freeze has created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome to administer to Alfred. Freeze atones for his misunderstanding by giving him medicine he had developed. Ivy is detained in Arkham alongside Freeze, who promises to torment Ivy during their sentence. After Alfred is cured, everyone agrees to let Barbara stay at Wayne Manor.|$|E
5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E

25|$|When <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lake, George {{pulls the}} car's choke to feign {{it is out}} of gas in order to hide the car in the woods. He acts visibly nervous when he rents a boat from a man who seems to deduce that George gave him a false name; the man's suspicions are aroused more when George asks him whether any other boaters are on the lake (none are). While they are out on the lake, Alice confesses her dreams about their happy future {{together}} with their child. As George apparently takes pity on her, and, judging from his attitude, decides not to carry out his murderous plan, Alice tries to stand up in the boat, causing it to capsize, and Alice drowns.|$|E
25|$|The {{possible}} {{impression that}} solo divers are unsociable is often wrong. Most solo divers are normally gregarious {{and want to}} share their enjoyment of diving with others – {{they just want to}} do it when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface. The solitude they want to enjoy is during the dive. These solo divers take pleasure in this solitude and in the feeling of self-sufficiency for this style of diving, that one is not dependent on others, but is relying solely on one's own skills and capabilities. Finally, there is the sense of freedom, of not being impeded by the need to look after anyone but oneself and therefore being able to achieve one's own goal in the dive without compromising.|$|E

25|$|Dream Chronicles: The Book of Air is {{structured}} much like other three previous {{games in the}} series with some major twists. There are lots of improvements in gameplay overall compared to others. It {{is more of a}} quest-like adventure than a traditional hidden object game, a mixing of adventure and puzzle game. Featuring loads of puzzles and logical quests with different difficulties, The Book of Air still assure that puzzles are well-tricky and tightly blended with the story, which is a typical feature of quest or click-and-point games, such as: putting together parts of broken statues, reconstructing tricky mechanisms, unscrambling messages using the power of Dream Jewels and many more. There are no lists of items to find but a huge amount of inventory based puzzles, logical riddles and quests to solve, which have been scattered through the locations in the game. The objects that players find may be used in a scene other than the one they found it in. Objects will stay in inventory until players need to use them. All objects that players are able to pick up will serve a purpose, whether they are used in that scene or not. A lot of times in this game the pieces players pick up may only be used as <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next scene. Some items may not become visible in a scene right away, players must perform other tasks first before they become visible.|$|E
500|$|Later, Charles Widmore's {{second in}} command, Zoe, {{arrives at the}} camp and threatens to destroy the camp with {{artillery}} shells if the Man in Black does not give back Desmond. Frank, Jack, Hurley, Sun, and Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) go with Sawyer's plan of betraying the Man in Black by joining Widmore, and they escape from the Man in Black's group. After Jack leaves the group, due to his reluctance to leave the island, the remaining group reach Hydra Island. However, Widmore betrays them, and has them locked in the animal cages at Hydra Station. The Man in Black attacks Widmore's camp as the Smoke Monster; allowing Jack, who has joined the Man in Black, to free Frank {{and the rest of}} the group. They then head to the Ajira plane to leave the island. But when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plane, the Man in Black reveals the plane is rigged with C4. He then suggests they leave the island by Widmore's submarine.|$|E
500|$|War for Cybertron was {{announced}} December 16, 2009, {{and was released}} in North America on June 22, 2010 with the PAL region release following on June 25, 2010.
