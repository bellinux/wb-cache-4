40|$|Effects {{of certain}} types of {{containers}} on maize seed germination after the three- and five-year period of storage were observed. Genetically stabe and reliable diverse material, i. e. seed of four parental inbred lines and two F 1 hybrid combinations of maize {{was used in the}} present study Seed produced in 1992 was kept in the storage room in PVC, one-and <b>three-ply</b> <b>paper</b> bags. Seed germiÂ­nation was tested by the standard method and cold test in 1994, 1996 and 1998. Germination varied over inbreeds and hybrids and both methods in dependence on types of containers. Obtained results show that the initial differences in germination among studied inbreeds and hybrids were maintained during the storage period and that the genotype is the most important factor of modifications. Moreover, the gained results indicate that the third variant of packing (<b>three-ply</b> <b>paper</b> bags) of seed of parental inbreeds and hybrid combinations was the least favorable after five-year storage...|$|E

The main medium in these surroundings is information, which value is still increasing. The creation of applications must flexibly react to development, but also to importance of information, and their safe transfer, transformation and safe storage. Current trend in creation of these applications is their functional dividing into the several layers. The one of the standards that creates these applications is also MVC i. e. standard Model-View-Controller, which belongs to <b>three-ply</b> applications. This <b>paper</b> describes the interconnection of three-ply applications in internet network to database systems, security components in these applications and their most effective combinations. The contribution is a concrete design realization of the connection to the database, and design of its most effective security combinations considering the standard MVC.
