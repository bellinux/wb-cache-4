It is also a main gateway of trade with Belarus due to its proximity to the border and its current and longstanding relationship with Hrodno, Belarus.|$|E
5|$|Bagramyan's {{experience}} in military planning as a {{chief of staff}} allowed him to distinguish himself as a capable commander {{in the early stages}} of the Soviet counter-offensives against Nazi Germany. He was given his first command of a unit in 1942, and in November 1943 received his most prestigious command as the commander of the 1st Baltic Front. As commander of the Baltic Front, he participated in the offensives which pushed German forces out of <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} conquered a huge area, including <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics,</b> Belarus and West Ukraine. After {{the successful}} Battle of Smolensk, Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily divert its Panzer groups {{to aid in}} the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev. This pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilise fresh reserves. The Moscow offensive, which resumed in October 1941, ended disastrously in December. On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Four days later, Germany declared war on the United States.|$|E

In October 1943, Bagramyan's 11th Guards Army was transferred to the Second Baltic Front which was concentrated on the retaking of Belarus and namely, <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics.</b> In November, Stalin offered Bagramyan the position of head commander of the First Baltic Front which had the similar objectives of the Second but was making little headway in its attempts to advance northwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} {{stagnation}} {{brought about the}} crisis of the Soviet system and reforms could not be long delayed. The new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985 and responded with glasnost and perestroika. They were attempts to reform the Soviet system from above to avoid revolution from below. The reforms failed to take into account that the USSR was held together by military force by repressing all forms of nationalism. The freedoms of Glasnost released long suppressed feelings of nationalism in <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics,</b> in a development known as the Singing Revolution. The first major demonstrations against the system were in Riga in November 1986 and the following spring in Tallinn. Small successful protests encouraged key individuals {{and by the end of}} 1988 the reform wing had gained a decisive position in <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union {{conducted}} {{a policy of}} Russification by encouraging Russians and other Russian-speaking ethnic groups of the Soviet Union to settle in <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>Republics.</b> Today, ethnic Russian immigrants from the former Soviet Union and their descendants make up a sizable minority in the Baltic states, particularly in Latvia (about one-quarter {{of the total population}} and close to one-half in the capital Riga) and Estonia (one-quarter of the population).|$|E

25|$|Catholics {{formed a}} {{substantial}} and active religious constituency in the Soviet Union. Their number increased dramatically with the annexation of territories of the Second Polish Republic in 1939 and <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> in 1940.

25|$|In March and April 1989 {{elections}} to the Congress of People's Deputies took place throughout the Soviet Union. This returned many pro-independence republicans, as many CPSU candidates were rejected. The televised Congress debates allowed {{the dissemination of}} pro-independence propositions. Indeed, 1989 would see numerous nationalistic protests; for example, beginning with <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> in January, laws were passed in most non-Russian republics giving precedence for the local language over Russian.|$|E
50|$|The CIS {{was founded}} in December 1991 {{at a meeting in}} Minsk of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.

5000|$|Eesti Gaas was {{established}} in 1990 as a state enterprise. [...] The company was partly privatized in 1993-1995. In 1993, 30% stake in Eesti Gaas was transferred to Lentransgaz, a subsidiary of Gazprom, to eliminate the gas debt dispute. In 1994, Ruhrgas (later: E.ON Ruhrgas) acquired about 15% of the company's shares while {{the management of the}} company together with other private investors, and <b>the</b> UK-based <b>Baltic</b> <b>Republic</b> Fund acquired 7.5% of shares both. [...] As a result, the Government of Estonia kept 39% stake. [...] In December 1996, Ruhrgas increased its stake to 21%; 12% was sold to public. In January 1999, the remaining state-owned shares were sold. Ruhrgas increased its stake up to 32%, Gazprom kept its 30% stake and Neste (later Fortum) got 10% stake. Later that year Itera (now part of Rosneft) Latvian branch acquired nearly 10% stake from <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>Republic</b> Fund. In following years, Gazprom increased its stake up to 37%, E.ON up to 33.66% and Fortum up to 17.7% by buying shares from private investors.

25|$|On 12 May 1990 {{the leaders}} of <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> signed a joint {{declaration}} known as the Baltic Entente. By mid-June the Soviets started negotiations with <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> on condition they agreed to freeze their declarations of independence. The Soviets had a bigger challenge elsewhere, {{in the form of}} the Russian Federal Republic proclaiming sovereignty in June. Simultaneously <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> also started to negotiate directly with the Russian Federal Republic. In Autumn 1990, they set up a customs border between the Baltic states, the Russian Federation and Belarus. After the failed negotiations the Soviets made a dramatic attempt to break the deadlock and sent troops to Lithuania and Latvia in January 1991. The attempts failed, dozens of civilians were killed, and the Soviet troops decided to retreat. In August 1991, the hard-line members of the Soviet government attempted to take control of the Soviet Union. One day after the coup on 21 August, the Estonians proclaimed independence. Shortly afterwards Soviet paratroops seized the Tallinn television tower. The Latvian parliament made similar a declaration at the same day. The coup failed but the Collapse of the Soviet Union became unavoidable. On 28 August, the European Community welcomed the restoration of the sovereignty and independence of the Baltic states. The Soviet Union recognised the Baltic independence on 6 September 1991. The Russian troops stayed for an additional three years, as Boris Yeltsin linked the issue of Russian minorities with troop withdrawals. Lithuania was the first to have the Russian troops withdrawn from its territory in August 1993. On 26 July 1994 Russian troops withdrew from Estonia and on 31 August 1994, Russian troops withdrew from Latvia. The Russian Federation ended its military presence in Estonia after it relinquished control of the nuclear facilities in Paldiski on 26 September 1995 and in Latvia after Skrunda-1 suspended operations on 31 August 1998 and subsequently dismantled. The last Russian soldier left Skrunda-1 in October 1999, thus marking a symbolic end to the Russian military presence on the soil of the Baltic countries.|$|E
25|$|By 1991, {{economic}} and political turmoil began to boil over, as <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> chose to secede from the Soviet Union. On March 17, a referendum was held, in which {{the vast majority of}} participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into a renewed federation. In August 1991, a coup d'état attempt by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led {{to the end of the}} Communist Party of the Soviet Union. On December 25, 1991, the USSR was dissolved into 15 post-Soviet states.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{democratisation}} of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe had irreparably {{undermined the}} power of the CPSU and Gorbachev himself. The relaxation of censorship and attempts to create more political openness had the unintended effect of re-awakening long-suppressed nationalist and anti-Russian feelings in the Soviet republics. Calls for greater independence from Moscow's rule grew louder, especially in <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, which had been annexed into the Soviet Union by Joseph Stalin in 1940. Nationalist feeling also took hold in Georgia, Ukraine, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.|$|E
25|$|The main {{issues are}} the territories which {{were part of}} Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in the interwar period, but which became {{incorporated}} into the Russian SFSR, Byelorussian SSR and Poland after World War II. In addition, some territories that were not controlled by <b>the</b> independent <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> were also annexed during the Soviet era. Most notable case is Vilnius taken from Poland by the USSR to become the capital of Lithuania.|$|R

25|$|The total {{numbers of}} those {{deported}} between 1944 and 1955 {{has been estimated}} at 124,000 in Estonia, 136,000 in Latvia and 245,000 in Lithuania. The deportees were allowed to return after the secret speech of Nikita Khrushchev in 1956, however many did not survive in their years in Siberia. Large numbers of {{the inhabitants of the}} Baltic countries fled westwards before the Soviet forces arrived in 1944. After the war, the Soviets established new borders for <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics.</b> Lithuania gained the regions of Vilnius and Klaipeda, but Estonia and Latvia ceded some eastern territories to the Russian SSR. Estonia lost 5 percent and Latvia 2 percent of its prewar territory.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} 5,025 submachine {{guns and}} 1,900 rifles {{were brought in}} {{to ensure that the}} operatives were sufficiently armed. Telecommunications was a vital component to ensure smooth running of the operation, thus the MGB commandeered all civilian telephone exchanges for the duration an brought in an extra 2,210 MGB communications personnel. 4,437 freight railway cars were delivered. A total of 8,422 trucks were organised. 5,010 civilian trucks were commandeered and the remaining vehicles were military origin, including 1,202 imported from the Leningrad Military District, 210 from the Byelorussian Military District and 700 from Internal Troops. These additional vehicles were stationed just outside the border of <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>Republics</b> in advance so as not to raise suspicion and sent in {{at the start of the}} operation.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> {{were largely}} {{isolated}} {{from the outside world}} between the late 1940s and the mid-1980s. The Soviets were sensitive about the Baltic area not only because concerns about its loyalty, but also because of a number of military installations located there due to its proximity to several non Eastern Bloc states, including surveillance centres and a submarine base. During the late 1960s, Soviet democratic movements found support amongst Baltic intellectuals. The Soviet Union signed the Helsinki Accords and the following year, a monitoring group was founded in Lithuania which produced dissident publications during the 1970s and 1980s. Nationalism and religion inspired people to small-scale demonstrations and underground activities. The European Parliament passed a resolution supporting the Baltic cause in 1982.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} work {{is driven by}} a desire to improve status quo in the area of New Zealand’s political, business and person-to-person relations with <b>the</b> post-Soviet <b>Baltic</b> <b>Republics</b> of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (<b>the</b> <b>Baltics</b> or <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> States), which by now represent {{an integral part of the}} European Union (EU). The example of Estonia will be tested as a possible ‘gateway’ for New Zealand trying to undertake its most recent endeavours towards discovering <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> region. <b>The</b> dissertation’s response variable can be outlined as ‘New Zealand multi-dimensional interactions with <b>the</b> post-Soviet <b>Baltic</b> <b>Republics,</b> particularly with <b>the</b> Republic of Estonia’. At the same time, the descriptive nature of the dependent variable is planned to be expanded with the help of the manipulated variable that will lead this {{research work}}. The latter variable will be formulated as ‘Estonia, a democratic, transparent, free-market state, can be chosen as a ‘gateway’ for New Zealand politics, business circles and the public in their endeavours to succeed in <b>the</b> post-Soviet <b>Baltic</b> region of <b>the</b> EU’. Such an approach will give a chance to scrutinise the studied issues comprehensively, from several angles (such as ‘theoretical’, ‘operational’ and ‘structural’), and by answering the following three research questions: is it necessary for New Zealand to promote its interests and values in the region of <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> States; does an idea to choose one of <b>the</b> three <b>Baltic</b> States as a ‘hub’ for promoting New Zealand interests and values in <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> region of <b>the</b> EU have a perspective; and can Estonia be considered/recommended to become such a ‘hub’?

25|$|The Soviet Union {{maintained}} ethnic diversity, but on {{the other}} hand it made efforts to impose uniformity. A new wave of Russification of education system began in the late 1970s attempting to create a Soviet national identity. The education of Baltic children was conducted in their native languages, but the Russian language was compulsory. In addition, the Soviet authorities limited freedom of expression in literature and the visual arts. The song festivals remained a means of national self-expression. Nevertheless, intellectual life and scientific research were advanced by Soviet standards. However, after 1975 there were increasing problems with shortages of consumer and food products, social problems, unchecked immigration and damage to the environment. By the 1980s there was social and political tension both within <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> and between them and Moscow.|$|E
25|$|Mass deportations {{of ethnic}} Estonians during the Soviet era {{together}} with migration into Estonia {{from other parts}} of the Soviet Union resulted in the proportion of ethnic Estonians in the country decreasing from 88% in 1934 to 62% in 1989. While <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> had the highest living standard in the Soviet Union and high rates of industrialisation, the ethnic Estonians in Estonian SSR (similarly to Latvians in Latvian SSR, but unlike Lithuanians in Lithuanian SSR) suffered a sharp decline of their proportion in the total population due to the large-scale immigration, mostly of Russians. While in 1934 the Estonians comprised 88 percent of the total population of Estonia, by 1959 and 1970 their number had decreased to 75 and 68 percent, respectively (and to 61.5% by 1989).|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, coalitions of reformists and populist forces {{assembled}} in Popular Fronts. They concentrated largely on calls for autonomy rather than independence. The Supreme Soviet of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic made the Estonian language the state language again in January 1989, and similar legislation {{was passed in}} Latvia and Lithuania soon after. Next, <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> declared their sovereignty: in November 1988 in Estonia, in May 1989 in Lithuania and July 1989 in Latvia. The Estonian Supreme Soviet reserved the right to veto laws of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The Lithuanian Supreme Soviet even referred to Lithuania's independent past and its illegal annexation into the Soviet Union in 1940. The Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR was more cautious. The presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union condemned the Estonian legislation as unconstitutional.|$|E
