Ahidjo pursued an economic policy of planned liberalism, prioritising cash crops and petroleum development. The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects; however, many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald also {{urged the}} federal Conservative {{government}} of R. B. Bennett to increase {{financial support to}} poorer provinces. At the time, there was no national system of unemployment insurance and the Bennett Conservatives insisted that the unemployed were mainly {{the responsibility of the}} provinces and municipalities. Although the federal government did provide relief during the Depression, Nova Scotia and the two other Maritime provinces were hampered by <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>system</b> of matching grants for relief programs. Under that system, provinces received federal money only if they were willing to contribute a percentage of their own revenues. Thus, the poorest provinces received less federal aid than the richer ones because they couldn't afford to match the federal grants. Historian E. R. Forbes points out for example, that from January to May 1935, all three levels of government spent an average of $2.84 for each relief recipient in the Maritimes, an amount less than half the $6.18 spent in the other six provinces.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>System</b> {{has faced}} various criticisms since its {{inception}} in 1913. These criticisms include the assertions that <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>System</b> violates <b>the</b> United States Constitution and that it impedes economic prosperity. Critic Miranda Fleschert contends that <b>the</b> twelve regional <b>Federal</b> Reserve banks (as opposed to <b>the</b> entire <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>System)</b> consider themselves to be private corporations with private funding. The movement to audit <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>System</b> has gained national traction; a bill related to the movement was passed through the House of Representatives in 2012. Many critics see auditing <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>System</b> as a means of gaining insight into an institution they contend has historically had little to no transparency, that has acted without congressional approval or oversight, and that has the power to create and loan U.S. dollars based on a monetary policy determined by its own interests.|$|R
25|$|All judges {{dismissed}} {{the separation of}} powers argument, their reasons differed. Brennan CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ held that {{the separation of powers}} doctrine did not apply to the power to make laws for a territory under section 122 of the Constitution and thus did not decide whether detention was a judicial power. Brennan CJ held that the territories were not part of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>system</b> that involved the distribution of powers between the Commonwealth and the States. Dawson J, McHugh J agreeing, held that section 122 of the Constitution permitted the Parliament to create courts that were not federal courts and not exercising federal jurisdiction. Dawson J doubted that the actions were of a judicial rather than an executive character.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{contentious}} {{issues in the}} Constitutional Conventions of the 1890s was {{the power of the}} Australian parliament to make laws concerning industrial disputes. The proposal was soundly defeated at the 1891, and 1897 conventions, but narrowly succeeded in 1898. All five High Court judges in 1910 had been leading participants in the Constitutional Conventions and all are properly seen as among the framers of the Constitution. The three inaugural 'federalist' judges, Griffith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ had all opposed the industrial dispute power while the two 'nationalist' judges, Isaacs & Higgins JJ had supported the power. Thus the clash between them is a continuation of the debate from the conventions concerning not only the capacity of the Australian parliament but also the nature of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{publications}} {{increased by}} 308% between 2005 and 2014, {{primarily as a}} result of Thomson Reuters' decision to track a much larger number of Brazilian journals in its database between 2006 and 2008. Despite this artificial boost, the pace of growth has slowed since 2011. Moreover, in terms of publications per capita, the country trails both the more dynamic emerging market economies and advanced economies, even if it is ahead of most of its neighbours. When it comes to impact, Brazil has lost a lot of ground in the past decade. One possible cause may be the speed with which enrolment in higher education has expanded since the mid-1990s, especially as concerns students passing through <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>system</b> of universities, some of which have resorted to hiring inexperienced faculty, including candidates without doctorates.|$|E

25|$|In March 1833, {{the capital}} of the state was {{transferred}} from Saltillo to Monclova.

Some legislators believed that centralism would {{be the only way to}} retain Texas, as newspapers in the United States continued to make statements about the forthcoming annexation of Texas. When the national congress attempted to centralize the nation, a civil war ensued. As fighting erupted, Saltillo declared that Monclova had been illegally made the state capitol and selected its own governor. Texans in Saltillo recommended establishing a provisional government in Bexar during the unrest to strengthen the autonomy of Texas. Juan Seguin, political chief of Bexar, called for a town meeting to create a government but was forced to postpone it when Mexican troops advanced in the direction of Texas.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} types of general trial courts in Putnam County: the New York Supreme Court, the County Court and the Justice Courts.

The Supreme Court has broad authority over all categories of cases, both civil and criminal. Generally the Supreme Court in Putnam hears civil cases involving claims in excess of $25,000. While the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over criminal cases in most counties this is handled by the County Courts. In Putnam however, the Supreme Court does exercise jurisdiction over some criminal cases.|$|E

Essentially, every country that was colonised at some time by England, Great Britain, or the United Kingdom uses common law except those that were formerly colonised by other nations, such as Quebec (which follows the law of France in part), South Africa and Sri Lanka (which follow Roman Dutch law), where the prior civil law system was retained to respect the civil rights of the local colonists.
