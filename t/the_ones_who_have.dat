25|$|Due to the {{multitude}} of different ethnic and religious identities of the Muslim Bulgarians, {{it is extremely difficult}} to calculate the exact number {{of the members of the}} community in Bulgaria. An inquiry conducted by the Bulgaran Ministry of the Interior in 1989 estimated their number at 269,000. A summation of the different groups with different religious and ethnic identities (approximately 130,000 Muslim Bulgarians, approximately 55,000-65,000 non-religious Bulgarians, up to 50,000 Muslim Turks, 15,000 to 20,000 undeclared and an unclear number, probably at least several thousands, of Christian Bulgarians) yields approximately the same number. Despite {{the multitude}} of different ethnic and religious affiliations, the predominant ethnic identity would be Bulgarian (approximately 200,000 or three-quarters of the total population) and the predominant religious identity would be Muslim (again approximately 200,000 or three-quarters of the total population). However, if only self-consciousness and self-declaration are taken into consideration, the number of Muslim Bulgarians would be only 131,531, i.e. <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> declared as such at the 2001 census.|$|E

For example, in Shadow of Heaven, Danara Pel is captured by an alien species, who desire vengeance against the Vidiians for their past organ-harvesting operations. Kes rescues Pel by using her psionic powers. In the alternative universe presented in the short story [...] "Places of Exile", the Doctor and Pel are <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> created the cure for the Phage. In this interpretation, the Vidiians form a more diplomatic bond with Voyager crew and promise to help expedite their return to the Alpha Quadrant.|$|E

500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be. The whole idea is that we’re <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E

Later, on The World Pornography Conference in 1998, he reported a similar conclusion, namely that [...] "no pornographic image is interpretable outside of its historical and social context.

2500|$|Over the red, {{black and}} white canvas there is a poem written in Braille by poet Chloe Mitchell; the braille follows {{the theme of the}} album's singles artwork which also {{features}} the same technique. Speaking on her choice to use the language, Rihanna commented, [...] "Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sight are the blindest." [...] During the cover's designing stage, Rihanna met with Mitchell, in which they [...] "drank" [...] {{and came up with a}} poem that would be used for the artwork and liner notes entitled If They Let Us. Mitchell explained the poem and its meaning to Rolling Stone magazine, stating it was about being misunderstood, but still be able to stand out while doing what is right for you. She further said that the poem speaks about not conforming to society and being a leader as well as accepting that being misunderstood is a positive thing.|$|E
2500|$|Increased {{spending}} on disease prevention is often suggested {{as a way}} of reducing health care spending. Whether prevention saves or costs money depends on the intervention. Childhood vaccinations, or contraceptives save much more than they cost. Research suggests that in many cases prevention does not produce significant long-term cost savings. Some interventions may be cost-effective by providing health benefits, while others are not cost-effective. [...] Preventive care is typically provided to many people who would never become ill, and for those who would have become ill is partially offset by the health care costs during additional years of life. On the other hand, research conducted by Novartis argues that the countries that have excelled in getting the highest value for healthcare spending are <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> invested more in prevention, early diagnosis and treatment. The trick is to avoid getting patients to hospital, which is where highest healthcare dollars are being consumed. Not all preventive measures have good ROI (EG. Global vaccination campaign for a rare infectious diseases). However, preventive measures such as diet, exercises and reduction of tobacco intake would have broad impact on many diseases and will offer good return of investment.|$|E
2500|$|If melee weapons {{could not}} be brought into combat, such as during long range defense, Qi {{recommended}} waiting [...] "until the face-the-enemy signal , and then, whether from behind wooden stockades, or from moat banks, or from below abatis (拒馬), [...] open up on the enemy, firing by turns (更番射賊). Those who are empty reload; those who are full fire again. While <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> fired are loading, those who are full then fire again. In this way, all day long, the firing of guns will not be lacking, and there must be no firing {{to the point of}} exhaustion [...] and no slipups with guns." [...] In 1571 Qi prescribed an ideal infantry regiment of 1080 arquebusiers out of 2700 men, or 40 percent of the infantry force. However it is not known how well this was actually implemented, and there is evidence that Qi was met with stiff resistance to the incorporation of newer gunpowder weapons in northern China while he was stationed there. He writes that [...] "in the north soldiers are stupid and impatient, {{to the point that they}} cannot see the strength of the musket, and they insist on holding tight to their fast lances (a type of fire lance), and although when comparing and vying on the practice field the musket can hit the bullseye ten times better than the fast-lance and five times better than the bow and arrow, they refuse to be convinced." ...|$|E

2500|$|The United Nations {{observed}} an [...] "alarming deterioration" [...] {{in human}} rights in territory held by insurgents affiliated with the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. The UN reported growing lawlessness in the region, documenting cases of targeted killings, torture, and abduction, primarily {{carried out by the}} forces of the Donetsk People's Republic. The UN also reported threats against, attacks on, and abductions of journalists and international observers, as well as the beatings and attacks on supporters of Ukrainian unity. Russia criticised these reports, and said that they were [...] "politically motivated". A report by Human Rights Watch said [...] "Anti-Kiev forces in eastern Ukraine are abducting, attacking, and harassing people they suspect of supporting the Ukrainian government or consider undesirable...anti-Kiev insurgents are using beatings and kidnappings to send the message that anyone who doesn't support them had better shut up or leave". There were also multiple instances of beatings, abductions, and possible executions of local residents by Ukrainian troops, such as Oleh Lyashko's militia and the Aidar territorial defence battalion. Amnesty International noted that pro-Kiev volunteer battalions are increasingly blocking humanitarian aid into eastern Ukraine. In August, Igor Druz, a senior advisor to pro-Russian insurgent commander Igor Girkin, said that [...] "On several occasions, in a state of emergency, we have carried out executions by shooting to prevent chaos. As a result, our troops, <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> pulled out of Sloviansk, are highly disciplined". By end of 2015 there were 79 places on the combined DPR and LPR territory where abducted civilians and prisoners of war.|$|E
