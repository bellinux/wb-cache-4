5|$|After {{leaving the}} Nation of Islam, MalcolmX {{announced}} {{his willingness to}} work with leaders {{of the civil rights}} movement, though he advocated some changes to their policies.

40|$|Auditory search {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the detectability of targets with regard to movements in temporal envelopes. <b>The</b> <b>movements</b> in <b>the</b> temporal envelopes of signals were defined as the mean value of slopes, i. e., the first order approximation of the temporal envelopes. <b>The</b> <b>movements</b> were systematically controlled by band-pass filtering on the modulation spectrum of <b>the</b> signals. <b>The</b> <b>movements</b> that we used in the {{experiments were}} 44, 154, 264, 374, 484, 594, and 704 mV/s. <b>The</b> <b>movements</b> of target signals were set at 264, 374, 484 mV/s. <b>The</b> <b>movements</b> of background signals in each target were set {{to be different from}} <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> between target and background signals. Stimuli were composed of different temporal envelopes with a noise carrier. 1 / 2 -octave band-noise as a carrier was used in which the center frequency of the carrier was 1380 Hz. The results obtained from auditory search experiments demonstrated that the detectability of each target signal could be improved when <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> of <b>the</b> target and background signals differed. The results revealed that the difference in <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> of <b>the</b> temporal envelopes of signals affected the detectability of the signals...|$|R

40|$|Spoiler Alert! The {{purpose of}} this essay is to analyze how {{religion}} and life philosophies are expressed and which funtion {{they have in the}} video- and computer game Fallout 4. This purpose will be achieved by looking into <b>the</b> religious <b>movements</b> that exists in the game. The method used is a thematic description with comparative appropriation and the essay was based on the following issues: Which God-image and cosmology characterizes <b>the</b> <b>movements?</b> How are <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> organized? Which ethical and political bases does <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> rest upon? In which way(s) are <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> presented, in a negative or positive way?   The basic conclusion is that the game contains several movements which are all different in some ways. Some are more similar than others while some are more different. The most common property is the belief of something itself, they are all expressing some kind of belief. <b>The</b> <b>movements</b> degree of organization varies. Some are far more structured than others. They do all have different purposes and goals which also make their ethical och political bases varying. <b>The</b> <b>movements</b> are mostly presented in some negative way but some are also presented in postive ways. <b>The</b> way <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> are presented in are therefor also varying...|$|R

5|$|From {{its initial}} origins in Eastern Sicily, {{especially}} in Catania, <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> got its real impetus {{with the establishment}} of the Fascio of Palermo on June 29, 1892.

5|$|Haydn's {{choice of}} D major for this quartet, {{with the second}} {{movement}} in D minor, optimises the use of open strings and allows for the work to be the loudest and most grandiose of the set. The first movement opens peculiarly: the first violin starts on an E, and proceeds to play a four-measure phrase that concludes with a D major chord. The use of a closing phrase to start <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> {{is the first of}} a number of unsettling incidents in <b>the</b> <b>movement.</b> The exposition withholds the expected cadence to the dominant almost until the exposition ends. And <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> itself has a tentative pianissimo ending that serves more as a link to the D-minor Adagio than a proper conclusion.|$|E
