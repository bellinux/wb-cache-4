In January 2015, Smartsheet added support for Microsoft's identity management software Azure Active Directory, which allowed users <b>to</b> <b>log</b> into products like Excel and Smartsheet with the same login. Users can also now make changes to smartsheets directly from Microsoft Outlook. In 2016 Smartsheet introduced Sights, a configurable dashboard that shows metrics such as how a team is performing against key performance indicators.|$|E
5|$|The {{network was}} also used heavily by {{government}} officials and rescue personnel, who used PDAs or laptops <b>to</b> <b>log</b> on to the network. It was used by rescue workers who were floating {{in the middle of}} the river and who could receive the signal to communicate with the headquarters in charge of the rescue operations. The wireless service was integral in sending large GIS files to the scene for rescuers to use in locating survivors. It was also utilized by the Minnesota Department of Transportation, the American Red Cross, and media outlets, both local and national. Retroactively, various Minneapolis officials deemed the presence of the network essential to the success of the response to the collapse.|$|E

5|$|The report divided Sa-iap {{history into}} four periods. Before 1937, {{the village was}} {{self-sustaining}} and used both farming and gathering for {{the overwhelming majority of}} its needs. In 1937, the Thai government allowed private companies <b>to</b> <b>log</b> the forest, destroying part of the villages' infrastructure. In 1957, the villagers entered the employ of the logging companies, causing internal and external conflict as well as increased reliance on unsustainable practices. Finally, in 1991 the villagers formed a conservation group, the Forest Lover Group, which the Chaobaan researchers agreed cut down on conflict. The mood of the villages has returned to one of mutual assistance and traditional customs.|$|E

Bubblegum considers its impact {{an attack on}} her kingdom and tells Johnnie to hide {{at the foot of}} their desk. When Lumpy finds Johnnie, she uses the device on him, attempting to revert him to when he loved her. Johnnie disappears; when Bubblegum figures out what has happened, she informs Lumpy that by failing <b>to</b> <b>log</b> his molecules, he no longer exists as part of their universe. To avoid having to grieve, Lumpy asks Bubblegum to use the device, properly, on her. Erased of her memory past her attacking Bubblegum, Lumpy storms out. Bubblegum pours herself a drink.|$|E

According to the Lebanese obligation of identification, it is compulsory for all Lebanese citizens habitually resident in the Republic of Lebanon, aged 15 or older, to possess either an identity card or a passport noting that the earlier offers no benefits compared to the passport with the exception of being easier to carry in a wallet or a handbag. It enables bearers <b>to</b> <b>log</b> into certain services on the Internet, local computers or add a digital signatures into LibreOffice ODF documents or create DigiDoc formatted containers that also allows encryption during content transfer.

5|$|Due {{to earlier}} {{recurring}} issues with mistranslations related to news updates, the team {{decided not to}} implement forums in the original release, instead hearing player feedback through fan sites and unofficial forums. Also because of mistranslation fears, dedicated teams {{in each of the}} game's release regions would gather feedback and transmit it to the development team. The game's first closed Alpha test began on March 11, 2010. It was available only to veteran players from XI. During alpha testing, the team used player feedback to find out key problems with the game, such as limitations on graphical adjustments making the game run at a slow frame rate. The open Beta test was originally scheduled to begin on August 31, but was indefinitely postponed due to the discovery of critical bugs in the game. The Beta test eventually went live on September 2, running until the game's release later that month. It was later stated that more time should have been given to fixing bugs during the Beta period. The game released on September 30, 2010, six months prior to the PS3 version's projected release date of March 2011. A Collector's Edition was released on September 22, allowing owners <b>to</b> <b>log</b> into the game from that date. The Collector's Edition, which was decorated by artwork from Amano and Yoshida, came with bonus items including a DVD featuring a behind-the-scenes documentary, a security token, a case for the game's box, and a decorated tumbler. The game was released with text in Japanese, English, French and German, while the spoken dialogue in cutscenes was English in all versions.|$|E

40|$|Establishing true {{depths of}} {{recovered}} sediments {{is critical to}} determining sedimentation rates for high-resolution paleoclimatic studies. We have corrected the composite depth scale, which accounts for the entire continuous sedimentary sequence, so that sediment depths are consistent with logging depths, or "true" depths. We accomplished this {{by taking advantage of}} dual measurements of sediment density: in-situ wireline density logs and shipboard Gamma-Ray Attenuation Porosity Evaluator (GRAPE) density measurements. Inverse correlation techniques (Martinson et al., 1982) were used to map the composite GRAPE density record <b>to</b> the <b>logging</b> density record at five sites (Sites 846, 847, 849, 850, and 851). Using these mapping functions, depths on the meters composite depth scale (mcd) were transformed <b>to</b> <b>logging</b> depths, which were then used to calculate sedimentation rates and discrete sample depths. Tables are provided for converting mcd <b>to</b> <b>logging</b> depth (see CD-ROM, this volume). Our analysis shows that the GRAPE and density logging data are coherent at wavelengths longer than 80 cm. This analysis indicates that logging records are good references for establishing true depth scales in sedimentary sections and may be successful proxies for shipboard measurements over sections having incomplete or poor core recovery, within some limitations. To estimate density variability over such sections, we define an average gain function for the logging tool that can be used <b>to</b> scale <b>logging</b> data <b>to</b> account for the tool's attenuation. Using the mcd <b>to</b> <b>logging</b> depth transformations, age models developed from cores can be applied accurately <b>to</b> <b>logging</b> dat...|$|R
