5|$|At the 8 August 1993 Fairchild air show, Holland {{once again}} {{commanded}} the B-52 demonstration flight. <b>The</b> <b>demonstration</b> profile once again included bank angles greater than 45°, low-altitude passes, and another high pitch climbing maneuver, {{this time in}} excess of 80° nose high. The climb was so steep that fuel flowed out of the vent holes from the aircraft's wing tanks. The new wing commander, Brigadier General James M. Richards, and the new DO, Colonel William E. Pellerin, both witnessed <b>the</b> <b>demonstration,</b> but neither took any action.|$|E
5|$|During a 19 May 1991 {{air show}} at Fairchild, Holland was the command pilot of the B-52 aerial-demonstration flight. During <b>the</b> <b>demonstration,</b> Holland's {{aircraft}} violated several safety regulations, including exceeding bank and pitch limits, flying {{directly over the}} air-show spectators, and possibly violating altitude restrictions. The base and wing commander, Colonel Arne Weinman, along with his staff, observed <b>the</b> <b>demonstration,</b> but apparently took no action.|$|E
5|$|Demonstrations {{began on}} the evening of 5 July with a protest in the Grand Bazaar, a {{prominent}} tourist site, and crowd reportedly gathering at the People's Square area. <b>The</b> <b>demonstration</b> began peacefully, and official and eyewitness accounts reported that it involved about 1,000 Uyghurs; the WUC said approximately 10,000 protesters took part.|$|E
50|$|Foreigners {{were accused}} of inciting <b>the</b> <b>demonstrations</b> by Vietnam {{and the ability of}} <b>the</b> <b>demonstrations</b> to take placed was blamed on {{leniency}} on part of the state by Nguyen Tan Dung, the Deputy Prime Minister.|$|R
25|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>demonstrations</b> {{received}} {{international media}} attention, {{all but one}} (Kanal Türk) of the local networks gave <b>the</b> <b>demonstrations</b> very little coverage. Habertürk director Melih Meriç said the lack of local coverage is because of political pressure.|$|R

5|$|In 1774, Antoine Lavoisier {{used the}} {{reaction}} of water steam with metallic iron inside an incandescent iron tube to produce hydrogen in his experiments leading to <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> of the conservation of mass, which was instrumental in changing chemistry from a qualitative science to a quantitative one.|$|E
5|$|In April 1949 Northcott {{took part}} in an event of {{historic}} importance at Sydney's famous Australia Hotel, being the venue of the first successful television demonstration in Australia. Northcott was televised in the hotel's ballroom as he opened <b>the</b> <b>demonstration.</b>|$|E

5|$|In March 2012, General Motors {{announced}} that an agreement was {{signed with the}} China Automotive Technology and Research Center (CATARC) to manage the Volt demonstration fleet in Beijing and to gather feedback from the fleet usage for one year. <b>The</b> <b>demonstration</b> Volts were scheduled to be delivered in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{anticipation}} {{when the}} first media for Unleashed was revealed was high, as <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> videos hinted at a possible return of Sonic to his traditional platforming roots, especially because of the series' declining quality in recent years, {{and a number of}} poorly received titles in the franchise that preceded it, such as the 2006 game, Sonic the Hedgehog.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May 1889 a {{demonstration}} train comprising two carriages and two locomotives {{ran along the}} newly completed line from Chesham to Rickmansworth, carrying the subscribers who had funded the extension {{and representatives of the}} local authorities and School Boards covering the areas through which the new line ran. (As no Metropolitan Railway train had yet run through to Chesham on the finished line, the train from Chesham to Rickmansworth was drawn by two locomotives belonging to the contractors who had built the line, rather than by MR engines. A third engine ran ahead of <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> train to act as a pilot.) A second train carried the directors of the Metropolitan Railway from London to Rickmansworth, collected those passengers who had ridden <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> train from Chesham to Rickmansworth, and continued to Chesham.|$|E

5|$|On 16 August 1819, Royton (like its neighbours) sent a {{contingent}} of its townsfolk to Manchester to join the mass political demonstration {{now known as the}} Peterloo massacre (owing to the 15 deaths and 400–700 injuries that followed). Royton's contingent was of particular note, in that it sent a sizable female section to <b>the</b> <b>demonstration.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{entering}} {{service in}} early and mid-1911, respectively, Edgar Quinet and Waldeck-Rousseau {{were assigned to}} the Mediterranean Fleet. In 1913, Edgar Quinet participated in an international naval demonstration that also included British, German, and Austro-Hungarian vessels off Albania. <b>The</b> <b>demonstration</b> was a protest of the Siege of Scutari during the First Balkan War; it succeeded in forcing the Serbian army to withdraw and allowing an international force to occupy the city.|$|E
5|$|Amid rainy weather, {{thousands}} of people attended <b>the</b> <b>demonstration,</b> gathering at a rally at Tom McCall Waterfront Park before marching 44 blocks of downtown Portland. Speakers included Earl Blumenauer, Suzanne Bonamici, and Elizabeth Steiner Hayward. Organizations that promoted the protest included the Audubon Society of Portland, Oregon Environmental Council, Oregon Health & Science University, and Xerces Society. Reporters noted organizers' attempts to create a political yet nonpartisan atmosphere, and participants' public criticism of Trump. The event featured activities for children and was described as having a family-friendly atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Cairo protesters had {{gathered}} {{in the morning in}} front of the High Court in the centre of Cairo. <b>The</b> <b>demonstration</b> was larger than expected.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>demonstrations</b> of <b>the</b> 13 March were {{allegedly}} invoked via spontaneous {{cell phone}} messages ending {{in the phrase}} [...] "pásalo" [...] (pass it on). The candidate of the governing conservative party, Mariano Rajoy, complained on television about <b>the</b> <b>demonstrations</b> and demanded that the opposition parties condemn them. On behalf of the Socialist party, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba gave a message saying that [...] "the Spanish people do not deserve a government that lies to them" [...] {{and that they had}} neither organized nor supported <b>the</b> <b>demonstrations.</b> According to Spanish electoral law, party-political <b>demonstrations</b> are illegal <b>the</b> day leading up to the election.|$|R
5|$|Hyde Park's Speakers' Corner has {{acquired}} an international reputation for demonstrations and other protests {{due to its}} tolerance of free speech. In 1855, a protest at the park was organised to demonstrate against Robert Grosvenor's attempt to ban Sunday trading, including a restriction on pub opening times. Karl Marx observed approximately 200,000 protesters attended <b>the</b> <b>demonstration,</b> which involved jeering and taunting at upper-class horse carriages. A further protest occurred a week later, {{but this time the}} police attacked the crowd.|$|E
5|$|If OHS is suspected, various {{tests are}} {{required}} for its confirmation. The most important initial test is <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> of elevated {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This requires an arterial blood gas determination, which involves taking a blood sample from an artery, usually the radial artery. Given that it would be complicated to perform this test on every patient with sleep-related breathing problems, some suggest that measuring bicarbonate levels in normal (venous) blood would be a reasonable screening test. If this is elevated (27mmol/l or higher), blood gasses should be measured.|$|E
5|$|In 1911 A.R. Angus, an Australian inventor, brought two {{locomotives}} {{onto the}} lower {{section of the}} line to test and demonstrate an automatic signal warning device. <b>The</b> <b>demonstration</b> of the system took place at Kentsford on 5 July 1912, which turned into something of a gala for local people, watching two hired GWR tender locos, the only tender locos to work this line, being brought safely to a halt rather than the anticipated head-on collision. Testing of this system continued intermittently until the outbreak of war.|$|E
