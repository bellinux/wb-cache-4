5|$|In 1874, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff and Joseph Achille Le Bel {{independently}} {{proposed that}} the phenomenon of optical activity {{could be explained by}} assuming that the chemical bonds between carbon atoms and their neighbors were directed towards the corners of a regular tetrahedron. This led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the three-dimensional nature of molecules.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} has led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> chemical {{bonds and}} non-covalent interactions. The initial studies revealed the typical radii of atoms, and confirmed many theoretical models of chemical bonding, {{such as the}} tetrahedral bonding of carbon in the diamond structure, the octahedral bonding of metals observed in ammonium hexachloroplatinate (IV), and the resonance observed in the planar carbonate group and in aromatic molecules. Kathleen Lonsdale's 1928 structure of hexamethylbenzene established the hexagonal symmetry of benzene and showed a clear difference in bond length between the aliphatic C–C bonds and aromatic C–C bonds; this finding led {{to the idea of}} resonance between chemical bonds, which had profound consequences for the development of chemistry. Her conclusions were anticipated by William Henry Bragg, who published models of naphthalene and anthracene in 1921 based on other molecules, an early form of molecular replacement.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of Oriental carpets, however, {{continue to be}} depicted as objects with visual appeal, without political connotations, but ignoring their original cultural context. It was reserved to a later century to try and reach out for {{a better understanding of}} the carpets within their Islamic cultural context. Whilst Islamic carpets initially served to adorn Renaissance paintings, later on the paintings contributed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the carpets. Comparative art historical research on Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting thus adds another facette, and leads <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the highly multifaceted, and sometimes ambivalent, image of the Ottomans during the Western European Renaissance.|$|E

25|$|Discontinuation of the Lutheran Hour merely caused W.A.M. to redouble {{speaking}} efforts. He {{still had}} access to KFUO for local broadcasting; several times {{he was invited to}} speak on The Lutheran Hour of Faith and Fellowship, a Detroit-based program which broadcast on a seven station network in Michigan and Indiana; he could reach the public through Messenger editorials; and he taught scores of young seminarians Semitic languages and culture, and how to apply this knowledge <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> Scripture.

25|$|Many of Earth's {{contemporary}} {{religions are}} shown to still exist, {{with the main}} human characters often having religious convictions. Among those specifically identified are the Roman Catholic branch of Christianity (including the Jesuits), Judaism, and the fictional Foundationism (which developed after first contact with alien races). Alien beliefs in the show range from the Centauri's Bacchanalian-influenced religions, {{of which there are}} up to seventy different denominations, to the more pantheistic as with the Narn and Minbari religions. In the show's third season, a community of Cistercian monks takes up residence on the Babylon 5 station, in order to learn what other races call God, and to come <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the different religions through study at close quarters.|$|E
25|$|Collective {{intelligence}} strongly {{contributes to}} the shift of knowledge and power from the individual to the collective. According to Eric S. Raymond (1998) and JC Herz (2005), open source intelligence will eventually generate superior outcomes to knowledge generated by proprietary software developed within corporations (Flew 2008). Media theorist Henry Jenkins sees collective intelligence as an 'alternative source of media power', related to convergence culture. He draws attention to education and the way people are learning to participate in knowledge cultures outside formal learning settings. Henry Jenkins criticizes schools which promote 'autonomous problem solvers and self-contained learners' while remaining hostile to learning through the means of collective intelligence. Both Pierre Lévy (2007) and Henry Jenkins (2008) support the claim that collective intelligence is important for democratization, as it is interlinked with knowledge-based culture and sustained by collective idea sharing, and thus contributes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> diverse society.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{discipline}} of anthropology, the term culture represents the customs, values, morals, laws and rituals which a particular group or society shares. In the public imagination, Wall Street represents economics and finance. However, although Wall Street employees may exhibit greedy and self-interested behaviours to the public, these behaviours are justified through their own value system and social practices. Various anthropologists have conducted research on Wall Street and it is their research which can confirm the negative views of Wall Street while providing the public with information that can contribute <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> how Wall Street workers perceive themselves. Anthropologist Karen Ho, who has conducted ethnographic research on Wall Street, states in Situating Global Capitalisms that the markets are beginning to self-regulate themselves in terms of neoliberalism. Through {{the perception of the}} public, financial investors take on a role that has already been established for them. It is both appropriate and fitting to call Wall Street a culture because of the system of values and practices it holds onto. Moreover, anthropological insight can help improve the general public's understanding of Wall Street and in turn allow the public to appreciate the culture of Wall Street which is both logical and sensible to the workers themselves.|$|E
