Cryogenic storage cuts weight but requires large liquification energies. The liquefaction process, involving pressurizing and cooling steps, is energy intensive. The liquefied hydrogen has lower energy density by volume than gasoline by approximately {{a factor of}} four, because of the low density of liquid hydrogen — there is actually more hydrogen in a liter of gasoline (116grams) <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> in a liter of pure liquid hydrogen (71grams). Liquid hydrogen storage tanks must also be well insulated to minimize boil off. Ice may form around the tank and help corrode it further if the liquid hydrogen tank insulation fails.|$|E

25|$|Liquid {{hydrogen}} or slush hydrogen may be used, {{as in the}} Space Shuttle. However {{liquid hydrogen}} requires cryogenic storage and boils around 20.268 K (−252.882°C or −423.188°F). Hence, its liquefaction imposes a large energy loss (as energy is needed to cool it down to that temperature). The tanks must also be well insulated to prevent boil off but adding insulation increases cost. Liquid hydrogen has less energy density by volume than hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline by approximately a factor of four. This highlights the density problem for pure hydrogen: there is actually about 64% more hydrogen in a liter of gasoline (116grams hydrogen) <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> in a liter of pure liquid hydrogen (71grams hydrogen). The carbon in the gasoline also contributes to the energy of combustion.|$|E

[...] There is debate about whether fanfiction about canon lesbians such as Willow and Tara of Buffy the Vampire Slayer counts as [...] "slash", their relationship storylines are more coy than heterosexual ones, which entices Willow/Tara femslash authors to fill in the gaps in the known relationship storyline.
