A meeting held on the association on July 24, 1971, was held to discuss the movement plan which involved disassembling and reassembling the house at its new location.

The house was donated to the State of Connecticut for use as a historic house museum.|$|E

5|$|In plants, {{nitrogen}} {{is first}} assimilated into organic compounds {{in the form}} of glutamate, formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. In order to form other amino acids, the plant uses transaminases <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>the</b> amino group to another alpha-keto carboxylic acid. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too.|$|E
