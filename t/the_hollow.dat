40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Hart Mountain is a basaltic fault block {{mountain}} in the semi-desert region of the northern Basin and Range province in south-central Oregon. Geomorphic processes associated with lingering snowpatches have formed nivation hollows, which are small scale depressions in the hillsides. The lingering snow in <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> prohibits shrub growth. Bedrock scarps, present in some of <b>the</b> <b>hollows,</b> show indications of chemical alteration. Bills are present below most of <b>the</b> <b>hollows,</b> indicating that surface runoff from these sites occurs. Average hillslope, which controls the shear stress placed on soil particles, is statistically related to morphometric attributes defining the size and angles of <b>the</b> <b>hollows.</b> Simple linear regressions and the nonparametric Kendall's rank correlation coefficient (p-) and Theil's C test for the regression line slope suggest that average hillslope {{is directly related to}} the morphometric attributes of <b>the</b> <b>hollows.</b> Heat transfer controls the areal distribution and duration of snowpatcnes. A relative insolation factor and elevation are taken as surrogates for heat transfer. These surrogates are likewise correlated with the morphometric attributes of <b>the</b> <b>hollows.</b> Both <b>the</b> elevation and the relative insolation factor suggest an inverse relationship between heat transfer and the size of nivation <b>hollows.</b> <b>The</b> <b>hollows</b> on Hart Mountain appear to have been formed by accelerated nivation processes during the Pleistocene and are currently being modified by less intense nivation...|$|R

5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York, Häyhänen {{spent the next}} two years establishing his identity. During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the thumbtack and no one had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper with it or using it as a subway token. For the next seven months <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. The trail of <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI. From 1953 to 1957, though every effort was made to decipher the microphotograph, the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.|$|E

5|$|Fighting {{continued}} around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings {{were heavily}} invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended {{the house and}} <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire, resulting {{in the destruction of}} all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the 71st Highlanders, a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by Hugh Halkett's 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out {{until the end of the}} battle.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple algorithm for hollowing out a solid CAD model. The algorithm employs voxel elements to do <b>the</b> <b>hollowing.</b> Instead of performing three-dimensional Boolean operations on the solid CAD model, one-dimensional Boolean operations between the ray {{representations of the}} model and voxel elements are carried out. The ray representation of <b>the</b> <b>hollowed</b> model in turn, produces the direct slice files as output to the rapid prototyping machine. In order to satisfy strength considerations, square and honeycomb structures are formed in <b>the</b> <b>hollowed</b> object. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

5|$|Abrahams Creek is {{the main}} source of {{flooding}} in West Wyoming, Forty Fort, and Swoyersville. Sheet flooding can occur when the creek floods over Eighth Street. There is a flood protection project for the creek in West Wyoming. This protection is capable of withstanding 100 year floods. The Slocum Dam, which is upstream of West Wyoming, also helps to reduce flooding on the creek. However, localized flooding and ponding frequently affect its lower reaches. The creek has been experienced extensive modifications, such as narrowing and riprap installation, in <b>The</b> <b>Hollow</b> to accommodate West Eighth Street.|$|E
