25|$|While <b>toxicokinetics</b> {{describes}} {{the changes in}} the concentrations of a toxicant over time due to the uptake, biotransformation, distribution and elimination of toxicants, toxicodynamics involves the interactions of a toxicant with a biological target and the functional or structural alterations in a cell that can eventually lead to a toxic effect. Depending on the toxicant’s chemical reactivity and vicinity, the toxicant may be able to interact with the biological target. Interactions between a toxicant and the biological target may also be more specific, where high-affinity binding sites increase the selectivity of interactions. For this reason, toxicity may be expressed primarily in certain tissues or organs. The targets are often receptors on the cell surface or in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Toxicants can either induce an unnecessary response or inhibit a natural response, which can cause damage. If the biological target is critical and the damage is severe enough, irreversible injury can occur first at the molecular level, which will translate into effects at higher levels of organization.|$|E

50|$|As calciseptine is {{injected}} by the snake into its prey {{along with the}} rest of its venom, it does not have to pass the protective barrier of the skin and {{is injected}} directly into the tissues and/or bloodstream of the prey. No research has been conducted on the <b>toxicokinetics</b> of calciseptine specifically, but general research about snake toxin dynamics is available.

50|$|It is an {{application}} of pharmacokinetics to determine {{the relationship between the}} systemic exposure of a compound in experimental animals and its toxicity. It is used primarily for establishing relationships between exposures in toxicology experiments in animals and the corresponding exposures in humans. However, it can also be used in environmental risk assessments {{in order to determine the}} potential effects of releasing chemicals into the environment. In order to quantify toxic effects <b>toxicokinetics</b> can be combined with toxicodynamics.

50|$|A well {{designed}} toxicokinetic study may involve several different strategies and {{depends on the}} scientific question to be answered. Controlled acute and repeated toxicokinetic animal studies are useful to identify a chemical's biological persistence, tissue and whole body half-life, and its potential to bioaccumulate. Toxicokinetic profiles can change with increasing exposure duration or dose. Real world environmental exposures generally occur as low level mixtures, such as from air, water, food, or tobacco products. Mixture effects may differ from individual chemical toxicokinetic profiles because of chemical interactions, synergistic, or competitive processes. For other reasons, it is equally important to characterize the <b>toxicokinetics</b> of individual chemicals constituents found in mixtures as information on behavior or fate of the individual chemical can help explain environmental, human, and wildlife biomonitoring studies.|$|E
