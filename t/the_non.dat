The coat is not as heavy as that of a Cocker Spaniel but will require grooming in order to prevent mats from appearing in the fur.

5|$|In general, Geographia Neoteriki, {{was welcomed}} with enthusiasm by western {{intellectual}} circles. Jean-Baptiste d'Ansse de Villoison, professor of modern Greek in the Ecole des Langues Orientales Vivantes, {{used it as a}} textbook for his students. French geographer Barbie du Bocage published a review after the book's publication along with a translated passage. Moreover, travellers who published accounts during the early 19th century, frequently cited the text. François Pouqueville, William Martin Leake, Henry Holland, and Lord Byron mentioned this work, and used it as a source of information. The book also enjoyed some popularity in <b>the</b> <b>non</b> Greek regions of the Balkan peninsula, while 19th century Bulgarian authors of geographic textbooks used it as a model.|$|E

5|$|The species {{first arrived}} in North America in 1941 (these early {{sightings}} were originally dismissed as escapees), bred in Florida in 1953, and spread rapidly, breeding {{for the first time}} in Canada in 1962. It is now commonly seen as far west as California. It was first recorded breeding in Cuba in 1957, in Costa Rica in 1958, and in Mexico in 1963, although it was probably established before that. In Europe, the species had historically declined in Spain and Portugal, but in the latter part of the 20th century it expanded back through the Iberian Peninsula, and then began to colonise other parts of Europe; southern France in 1958, northern France in 1981 and Italy in 1985. Breeding in the United Kingdom was recorded {{for the first time in}} 2008 only a year after an influx seen in the previous year. In 2008, cattle egrets were also reported as having moved into Ireland for the first time. This trend has continued and cattle egrets have become more numerous in southern Britain with influxes in some numbers during <b>the</b> <b>non</b> breeding seasons of 2007/08 and 2016/17. They bred in Britain again in 2017, following an influx in the previous winter, and may become established there.|$|E

40|$|Much {{has been}} written on <b>the</b> forum <b>non</b> conveniens doctrine, yet I {{nonetheless}} believe that recent developments in related areas still enable scholars to offer an original perspective on the subject.

The waning of some of those doctrines have diminished though not altogether eliminated the need for forum non conveniens, which always has had a suspect status following Erie’s declaration that there is “no federal general common law. ” While it is most certainly not the case that the underlying justification for <b>the</b> forum <b>non</b> conveniens doctrine has disappeared entirely, other doctrines may potentially better serve those residual functions. At bottom, then, we are entering an era where <b>the</b> forum <b>non</b> conveniens doctrine is ripe for radical reexamination...|$|R
