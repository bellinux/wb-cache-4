5|$|Nazi {{support for}} General Franco was {{motivated}} by several factors, including as a distraction from Hitler's central European strategy, {{and the creation of}} a Fascist Spain friendly to Germany to threaten France.

5|$|The J75 {{engine was}} {{slightly}} {{heavier than the}} PS-13, and therefore required ballast {{to be placed in}} the nose to return the centre of gravity to the correct position. In addition, the Astra fire-control system was not ready, and it too, was replaced by ballast. The otherwise unused weapons bay was loaded with <b>test</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} {{estimating}} the pressure (in lieu of direct measurements) {{is the fact}} that most of these storms did not threaten land. As Kenna and Patricia were threatening land, their pressures were measured by Hurricane Hunters using dropsondes. While Hurricane Ava never threatened land, it too was flown into by Hurricane Hunters to <b>test</b> <b>equipment</b> and conduct research.|$|E

5|$|To {{compete in}} this market, Roberts needed more capital. He took MITS public in November 1973 with a stock {{offering}} of 500,000 shares at $1 each. The 1973 oil crisis caused {{a stock market}} downturn and MITS was only able to sell 250,000 shares. This allowed MITS {{to pay off the}} existing debt, but did not allow for any expansion. Roberts had developed several <b>test</b> <b>equipment</b> products such as a Waveform Generator and a Digital Voltmeter so he attempted to appeal to kit builders again by featuring the <b>test</b> <b>equipment</b> and digital clocks in the advertisements, instead of calculators. MITS was losing money, and by July 1974, the full page prominent ads were replaced with quarter-page ads {{in the back of the}} magazine.|$|E
5|$|The orbiter {{carried the}} Development Flight Instrumentation (DFI) pallet in its forward payload bay; this had {{previously}} flown on Columbia to carry <b>test</b> <b>equipment.</b> The pallet was not outfitted with any flight instrumentation, but {{was used to}} mount two experiments. The first studied the interaction of ambient atomic oxygen with the structural materials of the orbiter and payload, while the second tested {{the performance of a}} heat pipe designed for use in the heat rejection systems of future spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{avionics}} software {{incorporates the}} concept of open architecture. Instead of the military-optimised Ada programming language, the software is written using the popular C++ programming language, enabling {{the use of the}} numerous civilian programmers available. The aircraft also includes a health and usage monitoring system, and automatic <b>test</b> <b>equipment.</b> The flight control system (FCS) comprises conventional controls with stability augmentation in the yaw and roll axis and a digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system in the pitch axis. The leading edge slats/flaps and trailing edge flaps are automatically adjusted during manoeuvring to increase turning performance. The FCS of serial production aircraft reportedly have a digital quadruplex (quad-redundant) FBW system in the pitch axis and a duplex (dual-redundant) FBW system in the roll and yaw axis.|$|E

5|$|In March 2013 Mitsubishi Motors {{reported}} {{two separate}} incidents with lithium-ion batteries used in its plug-in electric cars, {{one with an}} i-MiEV {{and the other with}} an Outlander P-HEV whose battery pack overheated and melted some of the battery cells. The battery packs are produced by GS Yuasa, the same company that supplies the batteries for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, whose entire fleet was grounded in January 2013 for lithium-ion battery problems. The lithium-ion battery of an i-MiEV caught fire at the Mizushima battery pack assembly plant on March 18 while connected to charge-discharge <b>test</b> <b>equipment.</b> Mitsubishi did not issue a recall, but halted production and sales of the two models until it determined the causes of the battery problems. According to Mitsubishi, the problem with the i-MiEV battery pack is related to a change in the GS Yuasa manufacturing process, and the carmaker notified fleet-vehicle operators with i-MiEVs whose batteries were made under the same process as those that overheated, and is working on a possible fix.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight test}} program was {{hampered}} by {{problems with the}} 747's JT9D engines. Difficulties included engine stalls caused by rapid throttle movements and distortion of the turbine casings after {{a short period of}} service. The problems delayed 747 deliveries for several months; up to 20 aircraft at the Everett plant were stranded while awaiting engine installation. The program was further delayed when one of the five test aircraft suffered serious damage during a landing attempt at Renton Municipal Airport, site of the company's Renton factory. On December 13, 1969 a test aircraft was being taken to have <b>test</b> <b>equipment</b> removed and a cabin installed when pilot Ralph C. Cokely undershot the airport's short runway. The 747's right, outer landing gear was torn off and two engine nacelles were damaged. However, these difficulties did not prevent Boeing from taking a test aircraft to the 28th Paris Air Show in mid-1969, where it was displayed to the public for the first time. The 747 received its FAA airworthiness certificate in December 1969, clearing it for introduction into service.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} and California {{sea lions}} {{were used in}} the United States Navy Marine Mammal Program (NMMP) to detect mines, protect ships from enemy soldiers, and recover objects. The Navy has never trained attack dolphins, as they {{would not be able to}} discern allied soldiers from enemy soldiers. There were five marine mammal teams, each purposed for one of the three tasks: MK4 (dolphins), MK5 (sea lions), MK6 (dolphins and sea lions), MK7 (dolphins), and MK8 (dolphins); MK is short for mark. The dolphin teams were trained to detect and mark mines either attached to the seafloor or floating in the water column, because dolphins can use their echolocative abilities to detect mines. The sea lion team retrieved <b>test</b> <b>equipment</b> such as fake mines or bombs dropped from planes usually out of reach of divers who would have to make multiple dives. MK6 protects harbors and ships from enemy divers, and was operational in the Gulf War and Vietnam War. The dolphins would swim up behind enemy divers and attach a buoy to their air tank, so that they would float to the surface and alert nearby Navy personnel. Sea lions would hand-cuff the enemy, and try to outmaneuver their counter-attacks.|$|E
