25|$|Later in his life, Emerson's {{ideas on}} race changed {{when he became}} more {{involved}} in the abolitionist movement {{while at the same time}} he began to more thoroughly analyze the philosophical implications of race and racial hierarchies. His beliefs shifted focus to the potential outcomes of racial conflicts. Emerson's racial views were closely related to his views on nationalism and national superiority, specifically that of the Saxons of ancient England, which was a common view in the United States of that time. Emerson used contemporary theories of race and natural science to support a theory of race development. He believed that the current political battle and the current enslavement of other races was an inevitable racial struggle, one that would result in the inevitable union of the United States. Such conflicts were necessary for <b>the</b> <b>dialectic</b> <b>of</b> change that would eventually allow the progress of the nation. In much of his later work, Emerson seems to allow the notion that different races will eventually mix in America. This hybridization process would lead to a superior race that would be to the advantage of the superiority of the United States.|$|E

500|$|Literary scholar Patricia Lee Yongue {{identifies}} Lincoln as {{the falling}} star. Further, she contrasts <b>the</b> <b>dialectic</b> <b>of</b> the [...] "powerful western falling star" [...] with a [...] "nascent spring" [...] and {{describes it as}} a metaphor for Lincoln's death meant to [...] "evoke powerful, conflicting emotions in the poet which transport him back to that first and continuously remembered rebellion signaling the death of his own innocence." [...] Biographer Betsy Erkkila writes that Whitman's star is [...] "the fallen star of America itself", and characterizes Whitman's association as [...] "politicopoetic myth to counter Booth's cry {{on the night of the}} assassination—Sic Semper Tyrannis—and the increasingly popular image of Lincoln as a dictatorial leader bent on abrogating rather than preserving basic American liberties". The star, seemingly immortal, is associated with Lincoln's vision for America—a vision of reconciliation and a national unity or identity that could only survive the president's death if Americans resolved to continue pursuing it. However, Vendler says that the poem dismisses the idea of a personal immortality through the symbol of the star, saying: [...] "the star sinks, and it is gone forever." ...|$|E

2500|$|To Donald J. Childs, {{the poem}} {{attempts}} {{to present the}} theme of Christianity {{from the viewpoint of}} the modernist individual with various references to the Incarnation and salvation. Childs believes that the poem moves from Christmas Day in line 19: [...] "in the Juvescence of the year," [...] to the Crucifixion in line 21 as it speaks of [...] "depraved May" [...] and [...] "flowering Judas". He argues that Gerontion contemplates the [...] "paradoxical recovery of freedom through slavery and grace through sin". In line 20, the narrator refers to Jesus as [...] "Christ the tiger", which emphasizes judgment rather than compassion, according to Jewel Spears Brooker in Mystery and Escape: T. S.

2500|$|Ultimately, Zhang's most {{important}} contribution {{to the field of}} Chinese philosophy was [...] "to show that it was possible, at least on an elementary level, to assert the validity of a 'traditional', namely Chinese Buddhist conceptual framework while simultaneously redefining individual notions, such as the boundaries of the logical realm, in accordance with a Western-derived understanding". Zhang ultimately showed students and contemporary intellectuals that ancient Chinese ideas could be brought back to life through <b>the</b> <b>dialectic</b> <b>of</b> Yogacara Buddhism. He also used ancient Chinese philosophic thought and Yogacara Buddhism as a framework to critique the political climate of his contemporary world. His deep understanding of Yogacara concepts allowed him to go beyond a critique of nationalistic politics and question the very foundations of the principles of modernity.|$|E
2500|$|Spencer Sunshine {{writes that}} [...] "here were {{many things that}} drew anarchists to Nietzsche: his hatred of the state; his disgust for the mindless social {{behavior}} of 'herds'; his anti-Christianity; his distrust {{of the effect of}} both the market and the State on cultural production; his desire for an 'overman'—that is, for a new human who was to be neither master nor slave; his praise of the ecstatic and creative self, with the artist as his prototype, who could say, 'Yes' to the self-creation of a new world on the basis of nothing; and his forwarding of the 'transvaluation of values' as source of change, as opposed to a Marxist conception of class struggle and <b>the</b> <b>dialectic</b> <b>of</b> a linear history".|$|E

[...] Kautsky contended that World War I had brutalized the working class and forced it backwards [...] "both morally and intellectually." [...] The social catastrophe of the war had brought about the Russian Revolution, Kautsky noted, leading to a collapse {{of the army and}} confiscation by the peasantry of landed estates for division into individual plots of land. The Bolsheviks made calculated use of this elemental force, in Kautsky's view, [...] "introducing anarchy in the country" [...] in exchange for [...] "a completely free hand in the towns in which they had already likewise won over the working classes." ...|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "The Subversion of the Subject and <b>the</b> <b>Dialectic</b> <b>of</b> Desire in the Freudian Unconscious". Lacan {{contends that}} the subject desires {{from the point of}} view of another whereby the object of someone's desire is an object desired by another one: what makes the object {{desirable}} is that it is precisely desired by someone else. Again Lacan follows Kojève who follows Hegel. This aspect of desire is present in hysteria for the hysteric is someone who converts another's desire into his/her own (see Sigmund Freud's [...] "Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria" [...] in SE VII, where Dora desires Frau K because she identifies with Herr K). What matters then in the analysis of a hysteric is not to find out the object of her desire but to discover the subject with whom she identifies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main channel}} from deconstructivist {{philosophy}} to architectural theory {{was through the}} philosopher Jacques Derrida's influence with Peter Eisenman. Eisenman drew some philosophical bases from the literary movement Deconstruction, and collaborated directly with Derrida on projects including an entry for the Parc de la Villette competition, documented in Chora l Works. Both Derrida and Eisenman, as well as Daniel Libeskind were concerned with the [...] "metaphysics of presence," [...] {{and this is the}} main subject of deconstructivist philosophy in architecture theory. The presupposition is that architecture is a language capable of communicating meaning and of receiving treatments by methods of linguistic philosophy. <b>The</b> <b>dialectic</b> <b>of</b> presence and absence, or solid and void occurs in much of Eisenman's projects, both built and unbuilt. Both Derrida and Eisenman believe that the locus, or place of presence, is architecture, and the same dialectic of presence and absence is found in construction and deconstructivism.|$|E
2500|$|Freud is {{also criticized}} by Shulamith Firestone and Eva Figes. In <b>The</b> <b>Dialectic</b> <b>of</b> Sex (1970), Firestone argues that Freud was a [...] "poet" [...] who {{produced}} metaphors rather than literal truths; in her view, Freud, like feminists, recognized that sexuality was the crucial problem of modern life, but ignored {{the social context}} and failed to question society itself. Firestone interprets Freud's [...] "metaphors" [...] {{in terms of the}} facts of power within the family. Figes tries in Patriarchal Attitudes (1970) to place Freud within a [...] "history of ideas". Juliet Mitchell defends Freud against his feminist critics in Psychoanalysis and Feminism (1974), accusing them of misreading him and misunderstanding the implications of psychoanalytic theory for feminism. Mitchell helped introduce English-speaking feminists to Lacan. Mitchell is criticized by Jane Gallop in The Daughter's Seduction (1982). Gallop compliments Mitchell for her criticism of feminist discussions of Freud, but finds her treatment of Lacanian theory lacking.|$|E
