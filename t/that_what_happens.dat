25|$|For Eastern Orthodox Christians, fasting is an {{important}} spiritual discipline, found in both the Old Testament and the New, and {{is tied to the}} principle in Orthodox theology of the synergy between the body (Greek: soma) and the soul (pneuma). That is to say, Orthodox Christians do not see a dichotomy between the body and the soul but rather consider them as a united whole, and they believe <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to one affects the other (this is known as the psychosomatic union between the body and the soul). Saint Gregory Palamas argued that man's body is not an enemy but a partner and collaborator with the soul. Christ, by taking a human body at the Incarnation, has made the flesh an inexhaustible source of sanctification. This same concept is also found in the much earlier homilies of Saint Macarius the Great.|$|E

She said to Inside Soap: [...] "I was filming out on location recently with Ace {{and a bunch}} of women came over to him and said, 'God, you're such a horrible man!' It's funny because Ace is such a sweet man - and you haven't even seen the worst of Yusef yet!" [...] Wadia continued: [...] "Let's just say <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> is the complete opposite of what you want to see. Zainab and Yusef share a dark and twisted love, and she definitely has feelings for him. It's not true and pure like what she used to have with Masood - and if Yusef manages to get her back to Pakistan, it will be the end for her. I wouldn't be surprised if Zainab ends up in some sort of home to recover from everything that's going to happen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Charles Taylor defines metanoia as [...] "to change one's mind of attitude" [...] {{and builds}} his {{pastoral}} counseling method on the [...] "metanoia model." [...] In doing so, Taylor recalls {{that the center}} of Jesus' ministry was a call to metanoia. For Milton Crum, metanoia means [...] "a change of perception with its behavioral fruit." [...] Thus, metanoia constitutes the central thing that needs to happen in preaching. Peter Senge observes <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> in a [...] "learning organization" [...] that experiences the [...] "deeper meaning of 'learning'" [...] is [...] "metanoia" [...] which means [...] "a shift of mind."

2500|$|Richie {{was interviewed}} in Soaplife {{and said that}} he thought it was {{important}} that no characters knew about the affair before Alfie did, because [...] "if Kat had confided in anyone that would mug Alfie off. He honestly never expected her to cheat again after everything they've been through." [...] Asked if Alfie brought it on himself by not paying Kat enough attention, Richie said that he did not, and finding out leaves him shocked, heartbroken and anrgy, as he thinks they are making their marriage work. He said that Alfie is a one-woman man and if Alfie had cheated on Kat, [...] "it {{would be the end of}} his world [...] He does genuinely believe in marriage." [...] Asked if Alfie could forgive Kat, Richie said that although Alfie has always done so in the past, [...] "it's different [...] so we'll have to wait and see." [...] He stated that Kat's affair might be because she loves adventure and Alfie is more [...] "set in his ways". He said <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> next is [...] "great", the storyline leading up to Christmas 2012 was [...] "full on" [...] and that the scripts were [...] "getting the old acting juices going".|$|E
2500|$|Acquired {{situational}} narcissism (ASN) {{is a form}} of narcissism {{that develops}} in late adolescence or adulthood, brought on by wealth, fame and the other trappings of celebrity. It was coined by Robert B. Millman, {{professor of psychiatry at the}} Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University. ASN differs from conventional narcissism in that it develops after childhood and is triggered and supported by the celebrity-obsessed society. [...] Fans, assistants and tabloid media all play into the idea that the person really is vastly more important than other people, triggering a narcissistic problem that might have been only a tendency, or latent, and helping it to become a full-blown personality disorder. [...] "Millman says <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to celebrities is that they get so used to people looking at them that they stop looking back at other people." [...] In its presentation and symptoms, it is indistinguishable from narcissistic personality disorder, differing only in its late onset and its support by large numbers of others. [...] "The lack of social norms, controls, and of people telling them how life really is, also makes these people believe they're invulnerable," [...] so that the person with ASN may suffer from unstable relationships, substance abuse and erratic behaviour. A famous fictional character with ASN is Norma Desmond, the main character of Sunset Boulevard.|$|E

2500|$|Attenborough {{starts the}} second {{programme}} {{by looking at}} potential future events, before warning <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> {{over the next few}} years is crucial. A BBC weather forecast for the year 2050 shows that summer temperatures of 38°C for the UK are [...] "par for the course". The probable range by which the planet will warm over the next century is between 1.4°C and 5.8°C. Or, says Attenborough, [...] "to put it another way, the impact of global warming will be somewhere between severe and catastrophic." [...] The naturalist is invited to watch a film that illustrates regional change over the next 100 years. A 2°C rise for the south of England, for example, may not seem to be much but that is not all there is to it. Rainfall is also predicted to be more intense and storms could be five times more frequent than they are at the moment. This makes extreme events, such as the 2004 Boscastle flood, much more likely. Current defences for severe wind or rain will shortly become inadequate. Even Hurricane Katrina, with the devastation it caused, is described as [...] "not particularly powerful". In Australia, a new approach is needed to combat brush fires after the hottest year on record. If the Amazon tropical rainforest were to disappear, not only would an entire ecosystem vanish, but a valuable way of cooling the planet would go as well. Meanwhile, the glaciers continue to melt: one scientist reveals that an area the size of Texas has been lost over the last 20 years. Attenborough is told that a warming of 2°C is inevitable, as a consequence of our actions over the last 25 years, but whether or not we end up at 6°C is still very much within our control.|$|E
60|$|Bearing this in mind, I {{think it}} must be admitted, that even when we have no {{knowledge}} whatever to guide our expectations, except the knowledge <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> must be some one of {{a certain number of}} possibilities, we may still reasonably judge, that one supposition is more probable to us than another supposition; and if we have any interest at stake, we shall best provide for it by acting conformably to that judgment.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the latter}} part of the seventeenth century, the {{doctrine}} of epigenesis, thus advocated by Harvey, was controverted, on the ground of direct observation, by Malpighi, who affirmed that the body of the chick is to be seen in the egg, before the punctum sanguineum makes it appearance. But, from this perfectly correct observation a conclusion which is by no means warranted was drawn; namely, that the chick, as a whole, really exists in the egg antecedently to incubation; and <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> in the course of the latter process is no addition of new parts, [...] "alias post alias natas," [...] as Harvey puts it, but a simple expansion, or unfolding, of the organs which already exist, though they are too small and inconspicuous to be discovered. The weight of Malpighi's observations therefore fell into the scale of that doctrine which Harvey terms metamorphosis, in contradistinction to epigenesis.|$|E

60|$|In {{what way}} the {{material}} circumstances {{are to be}} distinguished from those which are immaterial, or why some of the circumstances are material and others not so, we are {{not yet ready to}} point out. We must first observe, that there is a principle implied in the very statement of what Induction is; an assumption with regard to the course of nature and the order of the universe; namely, that there are such things in nature as parallel cases; <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> once, will, under a sufficient degree of similarity of circumstances, happen again, and not only again, but as often as the same circumstances recur. This, I say, is an assumption, involved in every case of induction. And, if we consult the actual course of nature, we find that the assumption is warranted. The universe, so far as known to us, is so constituted, that whatever is true in any one case, is true in all cases of a certain description; the only difficulty is, to find what description.|$|E

60|$|The {{assumption}} that sensible objects persist {{after they have}} ceased to be sensible--for example, that the hardness of a visible body, which has been discovered by touch, continues when the body is no longer touched--may {{be replaced by the}} statement that the effects of sensible objects persist, i.e. <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> now can only be accounted for, in many cases, by taking account of what happened at an earlier time. Everything that one man, by his own personal experience, can verify in the account of the world given by common sense and physics, will be explicable by some such means, since verification consists merely in the occurrence of an expected sense-datum. But what depends upon testimony, whether heard or read, cannot be explained in this way, since testimony depends upon the existence of minds other than our own, and thus requires a knowledge of something not given in sense. But before examining the question of our knowledge of other minds, let us return {{to the question of the}} thing-in-itself, namely, to the theory that what exists at times when we are not perceiving a given sensible object is something quite unlike that object, something which, together with us and our sense-organs, causes our sensations, but is never itself given in sensation.|$|E
60|$|There {{can be no}} reason, then, for doubting that, among insects, {{contagious}} {{and infectious}} diseases, of great malignity, are caused by minute organisms which are produced from pre-existing germs, or by homogenesis; {{and there is no}} reason, that I know of, for believing <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> in insects may not take place in the highest animals. Indeed, there is already strong evidence that some diseases of an extremely malignant and fatal character to which man is subject, are as much the work of minute organisms as is the Pébrine. I refer for this evidence to the very striking facts adduced by Professor Lister in his various well-known publications on the antiseptic method of treatment. It appears to me impossible to rise from the perusal of those publications without a strong conviction that the lamentable mortality which so frequently dogs the footsteps of the most skilful operator, and those deadly consequences of wounds and injuries which seem to haunt the very walls of great hospitals, and are, even now, destroying more men than die of bullet or bayonet, are due to the importation of minute organisms into wounds, and their increase and multiplication; and that the surgeon who saves most lives will be he who best works out the practical consequences of the hypothesis of Redi.|$|E
60|$|All of which, you see, is but {{a manner}} of making my point that her name means more than {{anything}} in the world to us but just our own. Only at present it means ever so much more, almost unspeakably more, than it has ever done in the past, and I can't help inviting you to feel with me, for a very few moments, what the real force of this association to which we now throb consists of, and why it so moves us. We enjoy generous emotions because they are generous, because generosity is a noble passion and a glow, because we spring with it for the time above our common pedestrian pace--and this just in proportion as all questions and doubts about it drop to the ground. But great reasons never spoil a great sympathy, and to see an inspiring object in a strong light never made any such a shade less inspiring. So, therefore, in these days when our great neighbour and Ally is before us in a beauty that is tragic, tragic because menaced and overdarkened, the closest possible appreciation of what it is that is thereby in peril for ourselves and for the world makes the image shine with its highest brightness at the same time that the cloud upon it is made more black.
