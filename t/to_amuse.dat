5|$|After {{retiring}} from baseball, Neuer became an umpire for local semi-pro and amateur baseball games, {{and worked for}} Bendix Aviation Corporation in Greene, New York until retiring in 1942. As an umpire, he {{was known for his}} entertaining style, adding extra emphasis on his calls <b>to</b> <b>amuse</b> game attendees. Neuer was married twice and had one son, Eugene, from his first marriage. He moved to Northumberland, Pennsylvania in the 1940s, where he lived until his death in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Following his graduation, Breckinridge {{returned}} to Kentucky {{with no clear}} direction in his life. He began <b>to</b> <b>amuse</b> himself by attending various parties and other social engagements. During {{a visit to the}} state capital, he so offended one man that he was challenged to a duel. Though he obtained two pistols, he never accepted the man's challenge, and was branded a coward. The dispute was later settled in the Masonic Lodge of which both Breckinridge and the other man were members.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} a {{flashback}} set seven years ago, where it is revealed that Brian {{was born in a}} puppy mill and taken from his mother. Back in the present, Brian tells his psychiatrist about the experience. Afterwards, Brian volunteers to pick up Stewie from his vacation at his grandparents' summer home in Palm Springs, California, where Stewie frames a maid for stealing <b>to</b> <b>amuse</b> himself at dinner.|$|E

5|$|In {{traditional}} tales {{the blue}} men {{have the power}} to create severe storms, but when the weather is fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the water. They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a porpoise. <b>To</b> <b>amuse</b> themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize.|$|E
5|$|The Field Spaniel {{can be a}} {{good family}} dog while it has a job to do. They are {{suitable}} for dog agility and hunting. Without some sort of purpose, the dog can often try <b>to</b> <b>amuse</b> itself and cause mischief. However, they are patient with children and like to stay close to their family. When socialised, they are good with other dogs. They are generally docile and independent, and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels. Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The Sermons of Swift {{have none}} of that thunder which appals, or that resistless and winning {{softness}} which melts, the hearts of an audience. He can never have enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent sentiment of love, of terror, or of devotion. His reasoning, however powerful, and indeed unanswerable, convinces the understanding, but is never addressed to the heart; and, indeed, from his instructions to a young clergyman, he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an English sermon. Occasionally, too, Swift's misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit; nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals, on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption. With such unamiable feelings towards his hearers, the preacher might indeed command their respect, but could never excite their sympathy. It may be feared that his Sermons were less popular from another cause, imputable more to the congregation than to the pastor. Swift spared not the vice of rich or poor; and, disdaining <b>to</b> <b>amuse</b> the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity, or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion, he rushes at once {{to the point of}} moral depravity, and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices in a tone of stern reproof, bordering upon reproach. In short, he tears the bandages from their wounds, like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital, and applies the incision knife and caustic with salutary, but rough and untamed severity. But, alas! the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities, that can profit by this harsh medicine. There is a principle of opposition in our nature, which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth, when it approaches our feelings in a harsh and insulting manner. And Swift was probably sensible, that his discourses, owing to these various causes, did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to the feelings of the preacher, because they reflect back to him those of the audience.|$|E

25|$|The circus clown {{developed}} in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from Philip Astley's London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows <b>to</b> <b>amuse</b> the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian George L. Fox became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.|$|E
6000|$|... 1st. Always hurry {{the bottle}} round {{for five or}} six rounds without prosing {{yourself}} or permitting others to prose.

Bored by the show, the two turned <b>to</b> <b>amusing</b> each other, pretending they were rock critics, inventing {{histories}} and {{comments about the}} Dylan band. They also made up various fictional band names, {{one of which was}} [...] "Barenaked Ladies".|$|R
25|$|The {{character}} of Peter Pan was invented to entertain George and Jack. Barrie would say, <b>to</b> <b>amuse</b> them, that their little brother Peter could fly. He claimed that babies were birds {{before they were}} born; parents put bars on nursery windows to keep the little ones from flying away. This grew into a tale of a baby boy who did fly away.|$|E
25|$|Many {{television}} shows and movies have used Marx Brothers references. Animaniacs and Tiny Toons, for example, have featured Marx Brothers jokes and skits. Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda) on M*A*S*H occasionally {{put on a}} fake nose and glasses, and, holding a cigar, did a Groucho impersonation <b>to</b> <b>amuse</b> patients recovering from surgery. Early episodes also featured a singing and off-scene character named Captain Spaulding as a tribute.|$|E

Two years on, however, the Ghosts are becoming restless from the lack of combat and purpose. A number of them go as far as turning to petty crime and other bad habits <b>to</b> <b>amuse</b> themselves. Ibram Gaunt himself becomes increasingly idle and distracted, but remains confident that the Tanith First will return to the front again soon.|$|E
5000|$|By the 1890s, many {{literary}} societies {{across the}} United States were declining, with the serious survivors turning into debating clubs. [...] Cornell's controversial transition from literary societies <b>to</b> <b>amusing</b> extracurricular activities {{occurred in the}} 1880s. When the literary societies proposed, through the Cornell Era, the substitution of charades or mock trials for traditional literary activities, more conservative editors at the University of Virginia refused. [...] The literary societies were starting to entertain activities of a less intellectual and more social nature. The transition from purely literary <b>to</b> <b>amusing</b> activities was noted by President Andrew Dickson White. His professional opinion was that the decline of Cornell’s undergraduate literary societies followed from the growth of Cornell's Greek System, the decline of oratory as a valued skill in late 19th century America, and Charles Kendall Adams' reforms which brought the [...] "seminary"or seminar system to the University.|$|R

25|$|In the Tang dynasty, Mulian was {{a popular}} topic of sutra lectures by monks. They often used {{pictures}} and songs <b>to</b> <b>amuse</b> their illiterate audiences, enriching the Mulian story with many variations and making it thoroughly Chinese. The story-tellers shaped their stories to meet the charge that Buddhism undermined filial piety because it took believers away from their families and prevented them from attending to their ancestors. The written versions of these stories were bianwen, of which a large number were preserved in the library cave at Dunhuang, an oasis in Central Asia, and not rediscovered until the twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|Work songs {{frequently}} feature {{call and}} response structures and {{are designed to}} enable the laborers who sing them to coordinate their efforts {{in accordance with the}} rhythms of the songs. They are frequently, but not invariably, composed. In the American armed forces, a lively oral tradition preserves jody calls ("Duckworth chants") which are sung while soldiers are on the march. Professional sailors made similar use of a large body of sea shanties. Love poetry, often of a tragic or regretful nature, prominently figures in many folk traditions. Nursery rhymes and nonsense verse used <b>to</b> <b>amuse</b> or quiet children also are frequent subjects of traditional songs.|$|E
25|$|The children's show {{changed its}} name and target age group in 2005. TV Xuxa, which was still a daily morning show, {{included}} games, cartoons, contest, and musical numbers <b>to</b> <b>amuse</b> kids of all ages. In 2008, TV Xuxa was reformulated {{to appeal to a}} wider audience and adopted a weekly talk show format that aired on Saturday mornings. The program stopped showing cartoons, and Xuxa began to receive her guests on a stage designed for interviews and musical numbers. On this stage, Xuxa talked with singers Justin Bieber (outside the studio, {{when he came to the}} show in Brazil), and Taylor Swift. In 2011, the show was moved to Saturday afternoons by Rede Globo.|$|E

25|$|A {{pioneer farmer}} had five sacks of grain, {{with no way}} of selling them or buying more. He had five {{possible}} uses: as basic feed for himself, food to build strength, food for his chickens for dietary variation, an ingredient for making whisky and feed for his parrots <b>to</b> <b>amuse</b> him. Then the farmer lost one sack of grain. Instead of reducing every activity by a fifth, the farmer simply starved the parrots as they were of less utility than the other four uses; in other words {{they were on the}} margin. And it is on the margin, and not with a view to the big picture, that we make economic decisions.|$|E
25|$|He was the {{youngest}} son of Yevgeny Botkin and his wife, Olga. His parents divorced in 1910, when Botkin was a child of 10, due to his father’s demanding position at court and his mother’s affair with his German tutor, Friedrich Lichinger, whom she later married. Yevgeny Botkin retained {{custody of the children}} following the divorce. His older brother Dmitry was killed in action during World War I. As a child, he and his sister Tatiana played with the children of Nicholas II during holidays. He used <b>to</b> <b>amuse</b> the grand duchesses on holidays and when they were all in exile at Tobolsk with caricatures of pigs dressed in human clothing acting like stuffy dignitaries at court.|$|E
25|$|In 1880, in a Harper and {{brothers}} review, it was said:-"Sedgwick has marked individuality; she writes {{with a higher}} aim than merely <b>to</b> <b>amuse.</b> Indeed, the rare endowments of her mind depend in an unusual degree upon the moral qualities {{with which they are}} united for their value. Animated by a cheerful philosophy, and anxious to pour its sunshine into every place where there is lurking care or suffering, she selects for illustration the scenes of everyday experience, paints them with exact fidelity, and seeks to diffuse over the mind a delicious serenity, and in the heart kind feelings and sympathies, and wise ambition and steady hope. Her style is colloquial, picturesque, and marked by a facile grace which is evidently a gift of nature. Her characters are nicely drawn and delicately contrasted, her delineation of manners decidedly the best that has appeared.|$|E
