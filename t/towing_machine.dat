50|$|In 1934 the {{production}} started. Out of approximately 350 ordered, only 151 were built until {{the outbreak of}} World War II. Approximately 108 were deployed to the artillery units, where the C7P {{was used as an}} artillery tractor in the regiments of heaviest artillery, mainly for towing of heavy 220 mm wz.32 Škoda mortars. Additional 18 tractors were attached to various tank units, mostly the Polish 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade for towing of immobilized tanks and for transport of tanks to the battlefield on specially designed towing platforms. Finally, two tractors were delivered to the engineering units for road maintenance and destruction of railways in case of a war. Until 1942 additional 52 were to be delivered to various communal services, where they were to be used as snowplows to keep the roads in good condition in case of a war. During the Polish Defensive War of 1939 all C7P were used in active service. Most were captured by the Germans and were used as <b>towing</b> <b>machines</b> and snowplows at least until 1941.|$|R

Graphic User Interface is used to monitor the whole system. When the fault is classified using PNN, its location can be used to generate control signals for PSS, which will be used to improve the stability in the power system.

But the economic situation remained difficult for the manufacturers too. The Leeds Mercury in the late 1830s and early 1840s carried many public notices of auctions of the equipment of bankrupt firms, which showed that they had been using - and so were now dumping on the second-hand market - machinery made by Taylor Wordsworth and Co, among others. Wordsworth was one of six machine-makers who were reported by the Mercury to have gone to London in February 1843, to the Board of Trade, to ask Lord Ripon for the law to be changed to allow the export of English-made flax and <b>tow</b> <b>machines</b> - in view of ‘the depressed state of the trade in that important branch of manufacturing industry’. [...] This was a complete turn-around in the manufacturers' position; in January 1827 Taylor Wordsworth and Co had joined many other Leeds manufacturers in publicly lobbying against a planned Bill to legalise the export of machinery, noting that 'great Danger may accrue to the Manufacturing Interests of the Kingdom if such Bill passed into a Law'. [...] Times were hard. A 'calamitous fire' at the company's works in February 1844 didn't help; but the firm had invested in a Leeds Water Works Company 'Fire Plug' (an early sort of hydrant, located in the factory), which averted complete disaster and which the company warmly recommended to others in the newspaper's account. Joshua Wordsworth had been appointed a Director of the Leeds Water Works in 1841.|$|R

40|$|A rectangular, variable-stiffness {{panel with}} tow {{overlaps}} was manufactured using an advanced <b>tow</b> placement <b>machine.</b> The cured panel had large anticlastic imperfections, with measured amplitudes of over two times the average panel thickness. These imperfections were {{not due to}} the overall steered-fiber layup or the tow overlaps, but instead resulted from local asymmetries in the laminate that were caused by a manufacturing oversight. In the nominal panel layup, fiber angles vary linearly from 60 degrees on the panel axial centerline to 30 degrees on the parallel edges. A geometrically nonlinear analysis was performed with a - 280 degree Fahrenheit thermal load to simulate the postcure cooldown to room temperature. The predicted geometric imperfections correlated well with the measured panel shape. Unique structural test fixtures were then developed which greatly reduced these imperfections, but they also caused prestresses in the panel. Surface imperfections measured after the panel was installed in the test fixtures were used with nonlinear finite element analyses to predict these fixturing-induced prestresses. These prestresses were also included in structural analyses of panel end compression to failure, and the analytical results compared well with test data when both geometric and material nonlinearities were included...|$|R
40|$|It is {{possible}} to create laminae that have spatially varying fiber orientation with a <b>tow</b> placement <b>machine.</b> A laminate which is composed of such plies will have sti#ness properties which vary {{as a function of}} position. Previous work had modelled such variable-stiffness laminae by taking a reference fiber path and creating subsequent paths by shifting the reference path. This thesis introduces a method where subsequent paths are truly parallel to the reference fiber path. The primary manufacturing constraint considered in the analysis of variable-sti#ness laminates was limits on fiber curvature which proved to be more restrictive for parallel fiber laminae than for shifted fiber. The in-plane responses of shifted and parallel fiber variable-sti#ness laminates to either an applied uniform end shortening or in-plane shear were determined. Both shifted and parallel fiber variable-stiffness laminates can redistribute the applied load thereby increasing critical buckling loads compared to traditional straight fiber laminates. The primary differences between the two methods is that parallel fiber laminates are not able to redistribute the loading to the degree of the shifted fiber. This significantly reduces the increase in critical buckling load for parallel fiber variable-sti#ness laminates over straight fiber laminates...|$|R

40|$|Elastic {{stiffness}} tailoring of laminated composite panels {{by allowing}} the fibers to curve within {{the plane of the}} laminate is a relatively novel design concept that has been demonstrated to be both beneficial and practical. In particular, for structures with highly non-uniform stress states, such as the case of a flat panel with a central hole subjected to in-plane loading, the concept is likely to provide substantial improvements in load carrying capability. The objective of the present study is to determine the effectiveness of stiffness tailoring through the use of curvilinear fibers to reduce stress concentrations around the hole and improve the load carrying capability of panels with holes. In this study software was created that translates standard finite element models with traditional laminate definitions into ones that possess stacking sequences with curvilinear fiber paths that are directly manufacturable using an advanced <b>tow</b> placement <b>machine.</b> Preliminary designs for the manufacturing and testing phase were determined through rudimentary design studies for flat plates without holes under axial compression. These candidate designs were then analyzed using finite element models that accurately reflect the test conditions and geometries in order to select final designs for testing. A total of six large panels, measuring three feet by six feet, each of which are used to produce four specimens with or without holes, were fabricated and delivered to NASA for machining and testing...|$|R
40|$|Tailoring {{composite}} laminates to {{vary the}} fiber orientations within a fiber layer of a laminate to address non-uniform stress states and provide structural advantages {{such as the}} alteration of principal load paths has potential application to future low-cost, light-weight structures for commercial transport aircraft. Evaluation of this approach requires {{the determination of the}} effectiveness of stiffness tailoring through the use of curvilinear fiber paths in flat panels including the reduction of stress concentrations around the holes and the increase in load carrying capability. Panels were designed through the use of an optimization code using a genetic algorithm and fabricated using a tow-steering approach. Manufacturing limitations, such as the radius of curvature of <b>tows</b> the <b>machine</b> could support, avoidance of wrinkling of fibers and minimization of gaps between fibers were considered in the design process. Variable stiffness tow-steered panels constructed with curvilinear fiber paths were fabricated so that the design methodology could be verified through experimentation. Finite element analysis where each element s stacking sequence was accurately defined is used to verify the behavior predicted based on the design code. Experiments on variable stiffness flat panels with central circular holes were conducted with the panels loaded in axial compression or shear. Tape and tow-steered panels are used to demonstrate the buckling, post-buckling and failure behavior of elastically tailored panels. The experimental results presented establish the buckling performance improvements attainable by elastic tailoring of composite laminates...|$|R

40|$|Variable Angle Tow (VAT) {{laminates}} {{that generally}} exhibit variable stiffness properties not only provide extended design freedom, but also offer beneficial stress distributions. In this paper, {{the prospect of}} VAT composite panels with significantly reduced loss of in-plane compressive stiffness in the postbuckled state in comparison with conventional structures, is studied. Specifically, we identify that both thickness and local fiber angle variation are required to effectively define “buckle-free” panels under compression loading. In this work, the postbuckling behaviour of variable thickness VAT composite panels is analyzed using an efficient and robust semi-analytical approach. Most previous works on the postbuckling of VAT panels assume constant thickness. The additional benefits of tailoring thickness variation {{in the design of}} VAT composite panels are seldom studied. However, in the process of manufacturing VAT laminates, either by using the conventional Advanced fiber Placement (AFP) <b>machine</b> (<b>tow</b> overlap) or the newly developed Continuous Tow Shearing (CTS) process (tow shrink) thickness build-up is inevitable. The postbuckling optimization for the design of VAT layups is conducted by a two-level framework using lamination parameters as intermediate design variables. The objective is to determine optimal lamination parameters and thickness distributions for maximizing the axial compressive stiffness of VAT laminates that are loaded in the postbuckling regime. The thickness variation due to both manufacturing of VAT laminates and for where it is independent of manufacturing process are considered. In accordance with the first-level optimal postbuckling solutions in terms of lamination parameters, we investigate a practical “buckle-free” VAT panel using a blended layup configuration. This blended VAT panel consists of a piecewise combination of segmental CTS layers and constant-thickness VAT layers. The prospect of taking advantage of a benign combination of stiffness and thickness to improve the overall compressive strength of VAT panels is studied. Finally, the optimal results are analysed to provide insight into the manufacturing of VAT laminates using either the AFP or the CTS process for improved postbuckling stiffness under compression loading...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. Terragrader (Pty) Ltd {{developed}} a working prototype for a machine {{capable of making}} and upgrading earth roads. The working prototype was based on practical engineering sense and any available components {{in order to produce}} a “concept proving” machine. As a consequence, a new working prototype was required which would include sound mechanical engineering design to address mass production requirements and any operational and maintenance issues. To achieve a sound prototype design, extensive research regarding earth road construction and maintenance was conducted. This dissertation documents the design and development of the new working prototype for a machine which will mechanically refurbish existing earth roads or create new earth roads in rural or informal areas in South Africa. The concept consists of a wheeled <b>machine</b> <b>towed</b> behind a commercial tractor. The tractor will provide the pulling force required to: • tear up (scarify) the existing earth road/ground. • grade and form the road shape. • stabilize the formed earth road by light compacting. The hydraulic pressure needed to actuate the machine is provided by the hydraulic power system integrated into the tractor. The machine will require a tractor driver, and one operator sitting {{at the rear of the}} machine. From this position the operator is able to observe and control every aspect of the earth road manufacturing process. It is envisaged that the production machine will be operated and maintained by semi skilled/unskilled workers, therefore, the new production working prototype must take this into account. The project, when implemented by Terragrader (Pty) Ltd will include training and instruction on the use and maintenance of the production machine. The research part of the project was done within several complimentary fields to gain a full understanding of the design requirements and constraints. The following complimentary fields were researched: • To determine the requirements of earth road design in South Africa, • To understand the make up of the earth conditions in South Africa, the types of road defects, the repair and construction methods applied in South Africa. • The amount of pulling force required to perform a grading, scarifying and compacting operation. As a consequence, a number of formulae and recommendations were identified and were utilized to quantify the pulling force required, thereby confirming that the tractor chosen by Terragrader (Pty) Ltd was adequate. • The types of existing road construction machinery have been researched and documented. A survey of the current commercially available earth construction machinery, in particular Graders, has been conducted to identify operating capacities, and compare these with the design criteria as specified. • Since the first working prototype was based on “engineering sense” only, mechanical engineering design practice was used to ensure that all initial design shortcomings and deficiencies were addressed to facilitate mass production, operation and maintenance. As this dissertation is being completed, the new production working prototype is being manufactured and any difficulties or improvements are being addressed and integrated into the design. The manufacturing of this second prototype will be completed towards the end of 2007, with the design finalization taking place once the prototype testing is completed...|$|R
