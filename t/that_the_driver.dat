5|$|On 22 July 2012, {{he died in}} a {{car crash}} under {{controversial}} circumstances. The Cuban government stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> had lost control of the vehicle and collided with a tree, while Payá's children and one of the car's passengers asserted that the car had been deliberately run off of the road.|$|E
5|$|The tender {{included}} a corridor connection and tunnel {{through the water}} tank giving access to the locomotive cab from the train so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> and fireman could be changed without stopping the train. The following year the locomotive appeared in the film The Flying Scotsman.|$|E
50|$|Also in 1953, NASCAR {{recommended}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> add roll bars, but did {{not require}} them.|$|R
50|$|Initially it {{was also}} assumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> had not {{properly}} regulated sand boxes, which could prevent wheel spin.|$|R
5000|$|... Romain Grosjean was {{excluded}} from race results {{after it was}} found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> car did not comply with the technical regulations.|$|R
5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} defence to {{question}} the court's jurisdiction, several witnesses were questioned {{over a period of}} several weeks, including Udin's neighbours and wife, as well as Sudarmo's nephew. The hearings, which were held on Mondays and Thursdays, were filled with spectators. At the trial, the defence suggested that a government conspiracy may have been responsible, but were told by the tribunal to focus on the case at hand. Further witnesses, including a key witness for the prosecution, came across as unconvincing; they also changed their stories, reneging statements which they had made before the trial. Other witnesses for the prosecution, including several of Sumaji's neighbours, testified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> could not have committed the murder because he was at home on the night of 13 August. Another said that the steel pipe said to be the murder weapon in court was different from that found with Udin's blood on it.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all other}} US states, New Jersey sets a 0.08 percent {{weight by volume}} blood alcohol content (BAC) as the {{threshold}} for intoxication when operating a motor vehicle (e.g. automobile, boat). It is possible {{to be charged with}} driving under the influence (DUI) with a BAC level below 0.08%, but there is a presumption in that situation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> is not intoxicated. State law prohibits those under 21 from driving if their BAC is 0.01% or more, prohibits the operation of a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or more, and mandates that drivers submit a breath sample if requested by a police officer. To be convicted of DUI in New Jersey, a person must be operating or attempting to operate a motorized vehicle; thus activities such as sleeping in a car while intoxicated or bicycling while drunk are not illegal.|$|E
5|$|The agents later see Walter Chaco, Paula's {{grandfather}} and the plant's owner, who while shaken over Paula's death gives the agents permission {{to perform an}} autopsy. The agents find that while Paula's personnel file gives her age as 47, she appears no older than her mid-20's. They also discover that Paula suffered from Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, a rare and fatal illness that causes dementia. When the agents nearly collide with a Chaco Chicken truck, they learn <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> also suffered from the disease. Noticing the plant's blood-red runoff in a nearby stream, Mulder orders a reluctant Sheriff Arens to dredge it. They quickly find the bones of nine people, including Kearns. While inspecting the skeletal remains, the agents notice that the skeletons are all missing their skulls, and that the bones {{appear to have been}} boiled. Meanwhile, Randolph and Harold discuss the uncovered bones and increase of Creutzfeldt–Jakob cases. While Randolph complains about Chaco's inaction, Harold assures him that he will talk to Chaco.|$|E
5000|$|... Driver {{is known}} to have failed to finish the race ^ Indicates <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> {{definitely}} finished <b>the</b> race The presence of neither * nor ^ indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> finishing status is not known.|$|R

25|$|During February 2016 an {{independent}} survey on <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> shortage {{was carried out}} by a UK freight exchange. The purpose of the survey was to get <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> opinions about <b>the</b> HGV <b>driver</b> shortage. <b>The</b> aim was to establish whether the results of <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> survey could help the industry and government understand <b>the</b> issues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> are currently facing.|$|R
5|$|The railway opened {{short of}} rolling stock as {{only half of}} the twelve {{locomotives}} and twenty-four of forty passenger carriages ordered had arrived. The carriage builders, Brown, Marshall & Co of Birmingham, stated that based on their experience they had expected the line to open at least two months late. The third day after opening to passengers, on 23 September, there was a collision between two trains at Kittybrewster that resulted in the death of a passenger and several serious injuries. The inquiry found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver,</b> attempting to make up time after a late start, had over-run previous stations and been approaching the terminus with excessive speed. The driver attempted to select reverse gear to slow the train but had failed {{to hold on to the}} lever, which slipped into forward, propelling the train into carriages waiting at the platform. The report also criticised the station staff, who should not have allowed the carriages to be waiting at the station. The layout at Kittybrewster was altered after the accident.|$|E
5|$|When Nick, Jordan, and Tom {{drive through}} the valley of ashes on their way home, they {{discover}} that Gatsby's car has struck and killed Tom's mistress, Myrtle. Nick later learns from Gatsby that Daisy, not Gatsby himself, was driving the car {{at the time of}} the accident but Gatsby took the blame. Myrtle's husband, George, falsely concludes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> of the yellow car is the secret lover he recently began suspecting she has, and sets out on foot to find him. After finding out the yellow car is Gatsby's, he arrives at Gatsby's mansion where he fatally shoots Gatsby and then himself. Nick stages an unsettlingly small funeral for Gatsby in which none of Gatsby's associates or partygoers attend. Later, Nick runs into Tom in New York and finds out that Tom had told George that Gatsby was Myrtle's secret lover and that Gatsby had killed her, then gave Gatsby's address to George. Nick breaks up with Jordan, and, disillusioned with the East, moves back to the Midwest.|$|E
25|$|The train event {{recorder}} revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> {{of the train}} passed a signal displaying a double yellow (caution) aspect. However, he only started to brake when the freight train came in sight. The investigation is ongoing.|$|E
50|$|Benchmarks show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> {{performance}} via FUSE {{is comparable}} to that of other filesystems' <b>drivers</b> in-kernel, provided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> CPU is powerful enough. On embedded or old systems, the high processor usage can severely limit performance.|$|R
25|$|Hevesi claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> {{were needed}} to provide {{security}} detail to his wife, though a bipartisan ethics panel concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state police found no threat that justified such an arrangement. The panel also concluded that Hevesi {{had no intention of}} repaying the state for <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> services until Callaghan publicly filed a complaint.|$|R
30|$|According to the {{statistics}} of traffic accidents, the human factor accounted for 95 % of all <b>the</b> factors <b>that</b> caused <b>the</b> accident, and the accident rate caused by <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> misoperation was {{as high as}} 73 %. This further indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> misoperation is a traffic accident and <b>the</b> main factor <b>that</b> occurs [5].|$|R
25|$|The {{first of}} the final tests {{consists}} of a multiple choice test regarding different scenarios <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> will be likely to meet on the public roads. The driver is allowed to make a maximum of five mistakes on this test.|$|E
25|$|The {{system was}} finally {{identified}} for replacement following an accident at Kensal Green, when a main line train {{ran into the}} back of Bakerloo Line train. The driver had apparently mistaken the calling on aspect for a normal yellow aspect (the signal was temporarily operating on a maximum yellow due to track side work). The indications were <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> was distracted as his pay slip and its envelope were recovered from the wreckage – but this was never proved as the cause. It was also suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> may not even have checked the indications having observed the fall of the train stop. The entire line was resignalled to the standard colour light system in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Although {{this only}} {{provides}} an approximation {{of how a}} train will behave during low adhesion, it does ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> can recognize the onset of wheel slide and will know the correct actions to take when it occurs.|$|E
50|$|The Coronial {{jury found}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> of both {{locomotives}} on the Bendigo train, {{together with the}} Stationmaster at Sunshine, had a case to answer. The charge of manslaughter against the stationmaster was later dropped, however <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> appeared before <b>the</b> Supreme Court from 24 September on <b>that</b> charge. <b>The</b> trial lasted two weeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are not for}} gaun intill Glasgow then?" [...] said Jeanie, as she {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> made no motion for inclining their horses' heads towards the ancient bridge, which was then the only mode of access to St. Mungo's capital.|$|R
25|$|A {{friend of}} Özgecan {{claimed that they}} had been afraid to use the minibuses in <b>the</b> area, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> and some {{passengers}} had stared at them through mirrors and windows whenever they left the bus several times before the incident.|$|R
25|$|Babs used exposed chains (covered by a fairing) to take {{power to}} the drive wheels. It has been rumored that the high engine cover {{required}} Parry-Thomas to drive with his head tilted to one side. This story is not true; photographs show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> could see straight ahead.|$|E
25|$|Consider <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> has {{adjusted}} the reversing lever {{such that the}} die block is at mid-gear. In this position the secondary motion is eliminated and the piston valve travel is shortest, giving minimal injection and exhaust of steam. The travel of the piston valve is twice the total of lap plus lead.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{facilities}} are designed so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> cannot exit the vehicle after pulling into the structure, but the prostitute can. In 2008, this design width {{was reported to}} be a problem in the Utrecht sex drive-in because the growing sizes of SUV and luxury cars meant they were having difficulties fitting into the slots.|$|E
50|$|Third {{model was}} the Parcel Delivery. This open car <b>that</b> {{accommodated}} <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> only.|$|R
50|$|All the {{necessary}} buttons placed strategically, classy, clean and ergonomically, all within an easy reach and sight to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> {{do not need}} to take his/her eye off the road. The ergonomic at best where <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> can simply rest his or her elbow in the armrest while the hand fiddling with the a/v-commander buttons and the gear lever.|$|R
30|$|The fully {{automated}} system {{was similar to}} the partially automated system in how it was activated and controlled; <b>the</b> difference was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> system also activated <b>the</b> steering, meaning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> could release <b>the</b> steering wheel and did not need to do anything for the 45 -min drive.|$|R
25|$|In Finland, the car driver's license can be {{obtained}} either in a private driving school or given by a near relative who has a driver's licence. It requires <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> has {{a car with a}} passenger brake pedal. The initial license expires after two years, and is revoked if the new driver accrues more than two fines.|$|E
25|$|On 23 June 2013 a Neoplan Tourliner was {{involved}} in the 2013 Podgorica bus crash, 18 people being killed. The Tourliner derailed from a bridge and fell about 40 meters into a ravine. The causes of the accident are uncertain, but survivors claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> was overspeeding while the tight mountain road was wet after a storm.|$|E
25|$|The {{hollow shaft}} {{mechanism}} lets the DCT operate sequentially, the car anticipating the next gear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> {{is likely to}} need next under acceleration or braking, or jump immediately to any of its seven forward gears (and reverse). This is particularly useful under kickdown or heavy braking, allowing the driver to remain {{in control of the}} vehicle at all times.|$|E
50|$|Officials {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> incident {{resulted in}} 16 fatalities and 58 injuries. One of the fatalities was an American woman, another a Russian national. On 6 March 2012, Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> of both trains {{and a number}} of train staff died in the incident.|$|R
25|$|The {{dashboard}} included lights <b>that</b> reminded <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>the</b> oil needed {{changing and}} the battery should be inspected.|$|R
40|$|While the {{literature}} on coopetitive strategies is expanding, the topic of <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> of coopetition has received little attention. However, understanding <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> of coopetition is a key issue for practitioners {{in charge of the}} implementation of the coopetition process. Addressing this gap in {{the literature}}, we explore <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> of SMEs coopetition in a French wine industry area: Pic-Saint-Loup. Our findings reveal <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> of coopetition are evolving and are determined by the environmental context and the centrality of the actors...|$|R
