This was acknowledged by the king Ladislaus in a charter dated 23 March 1407. However, new circumstances occurred in 1409, as Ladislaus sold his rights to Dalmatia to the Republic of Venice. Subsequently negotiated Sandalj Hranić Kosača the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> of the castle to Venetians and agreed upon its handover for the sum of 5.000 ducats.

40|$|The {{underwater}} {{acoustic channel}} features long and variable propagation delay, high {{bit error rate}} and limited bandwidth. Moreover, underwater mobile networks consisting of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for surveillance and monitoring applications often suffer from intermittent connectivity as nodes move around the area of operations. Therefore, this scenario is appropriately modeled as a Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN). In this paper, we investigate two classes of DTN routing protocols: Spray-and-Wait (SNW) and the Resource Allocation Protocol for Intentional DTN (RAPID), together with a standard flooding protocol for underwater mobile networks, and their performance is analyzed in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> packet <b>delivery</b> ratio, average end-to-end delivery delay and throughput, in different load conditions across various node mobility scenarios. Our results show that RAPID performs better than other DTN routing protocols in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> packet <b>delivery</b> ratio at higher load conditions irrespective of node mobility, whereas the Binary version of SNW has the best performance in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> average <b>delivery</b> delay...|$|R

The percentage of S-unmodified cystatin B was higher than the S-modified isoforms in the early PCA period, differently from adults where cystatin B was detectable only as S-modified derivatives. The percentage of S-modified derivatives increased {{as a function of}} PCA, reaching at the normal <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> values similar to those determined in at-term newborns, babies, and adults. Moreover, in the early PCA period, high relative amounts of the 1 - 53 and 54 - 98 cystatin B fragments were detected, decreasing as a function of PCA and disappearing at the normal <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b> In agreement with intact cystatin B, fragment 1 - 53 was detectable as S-unmodified and S-modified derivatives, and their percentages changed accordingly with the percentages of intact proteins, suggesting that the fragmentation process could be subsequent to and independent from the S-modification of the protein. This study highlights specific enzymatic activity in the oral cavity of preterm newborns not present in at-term newborns and adults, which can be a clue to specialized pathways occurring during fetal oral development...|$|R

Since web based auctions {{do not meet the}} same legal requirements as usual auctions do, defining the eAgreement is a very important step. An eAgreement includes, for example, the general rules of the eBidding, additional contract regulations and the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b> To make sure, that every supplier has basic know-how of an eBidding, trainings should be conducted. Once the eAgreement has also been approved by the suppliers, the eBidding can start. During a set time frame the suppliers have the chance to make bids.
