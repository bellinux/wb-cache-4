40|$|AbstractThe Rotterdam Capture and Storage Demonstration Project (ROAD) is an {{integrated}} CCS {{project in the}} Netherlands that has recently completed the storage permitting process. Development of the monitoring and contingency plans is {{a key component of}} this process. Our paper discusses the development of the monitoring and contingency plans, The project is technically relatively simple in comparison to other CO 2 storage projects, with a single well penetrating the reservoir and minimum equipment installed on the platform offshore. In spite of this, a most thorough approach to monitoring will be adopted. As new techniques and equipment are developed, these will be included whenever judged appropriate and in addition, provided that these techniques do not add to the complexity associated with operating an offshore, unmanned installation that will be producing hydrocarbons continuously throughout much of the project timeline.

40|$|The Project Rulison Monitoring Plan {{has been}} {{developed}} {{as part of the}} U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Legacy Management's mission to protect human health and the environment. The purpose of the plan is to monitor fluids from gas wells for radionuclides that would indicate contamination is migrating from the Rulison detonation zone to producing gas wells, allowing action to be taken before the contamination could pose a risk. <b>The</b> <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Plan</b> (1) lists the contaminants present and identifies those that have the greatest potential to migrate from the detonation zone (radionuclide source term), (2) identifies locations that monitor the most likely transport pathways, (3) identifies which fluids will be sampled (gas and liquid) and why, (4) establishes the frequency of sampling, and (5) specifies the most practical analyses and where the analysis results will be reported. The plan does not affect the long-term hydrologic sampling conducted by DOE since 1972, which will continue for the purpose of sampling shallow groundwater and surface water near the site. <b>The</b> <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Plan</b> was developed in anticipation of gas wells being drilled progressively nearer the Rulison site. DOE sampled 10 gas wells in 1997 and 2005 at distances ranging from 2. 7 to 7. 6 miles from the site to establish background concentrations for radionuclides. In a separate effort, gas industry operators and the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) developed an industry sampling and analysis plan that was implemented in 2007. The industry plan requires the sampling of gas wells within 3 miles of the site, with increased requirements for wells within 1 mile of the site. The DOE plan emphasizes the sampling of wells near the site (Figure 1), specifically those with a bottom-hole location of 1 mile or less from the detonation, depending on the direction relative to the natural fracture trend of the producing formation. Studies indicate that even the most mobile radionuclides created by the test are unlikely to migrate appreciable distances (hundreds of feet) from the detonation zone (Cooper et al. 2007, 2009). <b>The</b> <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Plan</b> was developed to provide a cautious and comprehensive approach for detecting any potential contaminant migration from the Rulison test site. It also provides an independent confirmation of results from the industry sampling and analysis plan while effectively increasing the sampling frequency of wells near the site...|$|E
