Recent {{research shows that}} Mongol armies may not have reached Bagan itself, and <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> did, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. However, the damage had already been done. The city, once home to some 50,000 to 200,000 people, {{had been reduced to}} a small town, never to regain its preeminence. The city formally ceased to be the capital of Burma in December 1297 when the Myinsaing Kingdom became the new power in Upper Burma.|$|E

Nevertheless, she gave a deposition to the Warren Commission.

500|$|The brigade's first {{casualties}} occurred {{while they}} were still en route, when two Dakotas were shot down flying over an Allied convoy with another nine damaged and forced to turn back. When they reached the Sicilian coast, Axis anti-aircraft fire shot down thirty-seven and a further ten were damaged and forced to abort their mission. Of the surviving aircraft, only thirty-nine managed to drop their paratroops within [...] of the correct DZ. Only four gliders arrived intact and those not shot down en route were destroyed while attempting to land. Despite these setbacks, the 250 surviving men of the 1st Parachute Battalion captured the bridge intact. The battalion commander, 28-year old Lieutenant Colonel Pearson, ordered his men to dig in {{on the north side of}} the river. Their only support weapons were three anti-tank guns, two 3inch mortars and a Vickers machine gun.

500|$|Meanwhile, midfielder Darren Fletcher {{was forced}} to miss the final after picking up a red card in the second leg of the semi-final. While replays showed that Fletcher played the ball before felling Cesc Fàbregas in the penalty area, the UEFA appeals process only allows for cards to be {{rescinded}} {{in the case of}} mistaken identity. Despite this, an appeal was submitted by Manchester United on [...] "compassionate" [...] grounds. Barcelona decided to appeal against the suspensions of Abidal and Alves after United lodged an appeal against Fletcher's red card. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola came out in support of overturning all three players' suspensions. The appeals were declared unsuccessful on 11 May, with UEFA saying in a statement that the appeals were not submitted within the required 24-hour deadline of the matches and <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had been submitted on time then [...] "they would have been rejected as unfounded as there were no grounds for contesting the referees' original decisions."

500|$|When the Cuban {{government}} blocked {{access to}} Sánchez's blog from the island, it also blocked {{access to the}} DesdeCuba website, where these other blogs were housed. The other bloggers faced the same challenges Sánchez had in maintaining their blogs, and also needed to find ways around the censorship—either relying on friends with access inside Cuba from their government offices, using complex and time-consuming workarounds to find 'back doors' into their blogs, or reaching out to friends and strangers abroad who volunteered to help, [...] and who posted email blog entries they {{would never be able}} to see. [...] With their blogs targeted to Cuban readers on the island, the discouragement was compounded by knowing <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> could post, their readers could not read the posts. This limitation was circumvented by making copies of the blogs on CDs, either from computers on the island with access to the website, or sent from friends abroad. [...] Although this method of disseminating the blogs was slow and delayed, and readers could not comment directly on the website, it was quite effective and continues to this day [...] Sanchéz said to a known Venezuelan blogger that visited her in Havana: [...] "In any case we are trying to educate others so blogging would become in Cuba a permanent feature, a means of democratizing citizen expression, as in the free world." ...|$|E

500|$|One of Walker's tasks was {{to rewrite}} the {{bombardment}} text. He felt it was flawed because it failed to drive home {{what he saw as}} the most important fact, that [...] "bombardment aviation is the basic arm of the air force". Following the views of air power theorists Billy Mitchell, Hugh Trenchard, and Giulio Douhet, Walker enunciated two fundamental principles: that bombardment would take the form of daylight precision bombing; and that it should be directed against critical industrial targets. In his article [...] "Driving Home the Bombardment Attack", published in the Coast Artillery Journal in October 1930, he argued that fighters could not prevent a bombing attack and that [...] "the most efficacious method of stopping a bombardment attack would appear to be an offensive against the bombardment airdrome." [...] The Bomber Mafia argued that bombers flew too high and too fast to be intercepted by fighters, <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were intercepted, the bombers had enough firepower to drive off their attackers, and enough armor and resilience to absorb any damage their attackers might attempt to inflict. The Air Corps Tactical School developed a doctrine that became known as industrial web theory, which called for precision attacks against carefully selected critical industrial targets. [...] Walker drove home his belief in bombardment with a famous dictum from his lectures: [...] "A well-organized, well-planned, and well-flown air force attack will constitute an offensive that can not be stopped." ...|$|E
500|$|The UK Human Rights Act 1998 makes Article 9(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, {{which protects}} freedom of religion, {{enforceable}} in UK domestic law. Article 9(2) states when {{the freedom of}} religion may be restricted: [...] "Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary {{in a democratic society}} in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or {{for the protection of the}} rights and freedoms of others." [...] R. (Begum) v. Headteacher and Governors of Denbigh High School (2006) was a House of Lords case involving a female Muslim student who wished to wear a jilbab (a long, coat-like garment) to comply with her understanding of the requirements of her faith, but was disallowed from doing so. Lord Bingham of Cornhill said that under Article 9(2), for a restriction to be justified it must be [...] "prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society for a permissible purpose, that is, it must be directed to a legitimate purpose and must be proportionate in scope and effect". In the end, a majority of the Law Lords hearing the appeal (including Lord Bingham) held that the appellant's rights had not been interfered with. However, the court held unanimously <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had been, there were justifiable grounds for such interference, one of which was the need to protect the rights of other female students at the school who would not wish to be pressured into adopting a more extreme form of Muslim dress.|$|E

2500|$|Almost entirely through luck, Mandella survives {{four years}} of {{military}} service, while several centuries elapse in real time.
