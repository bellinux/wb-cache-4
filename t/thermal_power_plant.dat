40|$|Climate {{variability}} {{and change}} affect electricity generation in several ways. Electricity generation is directly dependent on climate/weather parameters like wind (wind power generation) or air temperature and resulting water temperature (<b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants).</b> River discharge {{as a result}} of precipitation and temperature, the latter being one main factor influencing evapotranspiration, is important for hydro power generation and cooling of <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> In this study possible effects of climate variability and change on electricity generation in Germany are analyzed. Considered is electricity generation by <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> wind <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> and hydro <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> While hydro <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> and <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> are affected negatively due to declining river discharge or higher water temperatures, for wind power generation no clear tendency was found. The reduction for hydro power generation could be leveled out by a slight increase in installed capacity and modernization of turbines and generators. By a replacement of old once-through cooling systems by closed-circuit cooling systems for new <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> the negative impacts on electricity generation can be reduced significantly. The planned increase of installed capacity for wind power generation clearly surpasses the changes arising from climate change...|$|R

40|$|The {{output of}} {{renewable}} energy fluctuates significantly depending on weather conditions. We develop a unit commitment model to analyze requirements of the forecast output and its error for renewable energies. Our model obtains the time series for the operational state of <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> that would maximize the profits of an electric power utility by taking into account both the forecast of output its error for renewable energies and the demand response of consumers. We consider a power system consisting of <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> photovoltaic systems (PV), and wind farms and analyze {{the effect of the}} forecast error on the operation cost and reserves. We confirm that the operation cost was increases with the forecast error. The effect of a sudden decrease in wind power is also analyzed. More <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> need to be operated to generate power to absorb this sudden decrease in wind power. The {{increase in the number of}} operating <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> within a short period does not affect the total operation cost significantly; however the substitution of <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> by wind farms or PV systems is not expected to be very high. Finally, the effects of the demand response in the case of a sudden decrease in wind power are analyzed. We confirm that the number of operating <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> is reduced by the demand response. A power utility has to continue <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> for ensuring supply-demand balance; some of these plants can be decommissioned after installing a large number of wind farms or PV systems, if the demand response is applied using an appropriate price structure.

The new strategies also included plans that worked with the nearby capital of Mexicali, where the pipeline shared between the two states was constructed to supply natural gas to its metropolitan area with energy supplied by Sempra and Proxima.

25|$|Solar thermal {{collectors}} {{are classified}} by the United States Energy Information Administration as low-, medium-, or high-temperature collectors. Low-temperature collectors are generally unglazed {{and used to}} heat swimming pools or to heat ventilation air. Medium-temperature collectors are also usually flat plates but are used for heating water or air for residential and commercial use. High-temperature collectors concentrate sunlight using mirrors or lenses and are generally used for fulfilling heat requirements up to 300 deg C / 20 bar pressure in industries, and for electric power production. Two categories include Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) for fulfilling heat requirements in industries, and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) when the heat collected is used for power generation. CST and CSP are not replaceable in terms of application. The largest facilities {{are located in the}} American Mojave Desert of California and Nevada.
