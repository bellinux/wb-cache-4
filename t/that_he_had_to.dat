According to him, if she was killed, he would go free. Raynor made the decision right there and blocked a shot from Tychus, intended for Kerrigan, and he shot his friend dead.|$|E

He later admitted to having ruffled some feathers in the NFL, but said, “it wasn’t as if they didn’t deserve it”.|$|E
5|$|Among Waugh's growing {{circle of}} friends were Diana Guinness and Bryan Guinness (dedicatees of Vile Bodies), Lady Diana Cooper and her husband Duff Cooper, Nancy Mitford who was {{originally}} a friend of Evelyn Gardner's, and the Lygon sisters. Waugh had known Hugh Patrick Lygon at Oxford; now he {{was introduced to the}} girls and their country house, Madresfield Court, which became the closest <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> a home during his years of wandering. In 1933, on a Greek islands cruise, he was introduced by Father D'Arcy to Gabriel Herbert, eldest daughter of the late explorer Aubrey Herbert. When the cruise ended Waugh was invited to stay at the Herbert family's villa in Portofino, where he first met Gabriel's 17-year-old sister, Laura.|$|E

5|$|Before {{taking the}} role, Capaldi said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> seriously {{consider}} the increased visibility {{that would come}} with the part. He {{said in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly that he had been invited to audition for the role of the Eighth Doctor in 1995 before the production of the 1996 TV film, but did not go because he was unsure if he would get the part and did not wish to be part of a large group of actors turned down for the role.|$|E
5|$|Dev Gill was {{selected}} to portray the film's antagonist. Rajamouli was criticised for selecting him considering Gill's previous film, Krishnarjuna (2008), but remained adamant about casting him. He said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> cast a good looking man as the film's villain because the heroine needed to find him trustworthy. For this film, Gill had to practice horse riding in Ramoji Film City; Ram Charan was already an experienced equestrian. Srihari was cast in {{his role in the}} film in early April 2008. Kim Sharma {{was selected}} to perform one of the two item numbers in the film in early June 2008. Saloni Aswani made a cameo appearance in the film and shot for three days. She was subsequently signed for Rajamouli's next project, Maryada Ramanna (2010), before Magadheera was even released.|$|E
5|$|Espejo {{realized}} that the charges against the clergy were so serious <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> focus on destroying Barreto's credibility. Therefore, he implied that Barreto's own conduct was outrageous because of his excesses in collecting taxes and his habit of paying public funds to licentious women. Additionally, he stated that the real author of the report was José Miguel Vallejo, whom he called an immoral man who despised the clergy. Thus, Espejo claimed the report should not be believed.|$|E

5|$|Foster {{looked for}} a {{director}} and Peter Bogdanovich came to his attention. Bogdanovich's agent, Jeff Berg, set up a special screening of his client's soon-to-be released The Last Picture Show (1971) for Foster with McQueen in attendance. They loved it and met with the director and a deal was made. However, Warner Bros. approached Bogdanovich with an offer to direct What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand, with the stipulation <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> start right away. The director wanted to do both, and the studio refused. When McQueen found out, he became upset and told Bogdanovich {{that he was going}} to get someone else to direct The Getaway.|$|E
5|$|Glubb {{nevertheless}} {{knew that}} the Israeli army would sooner or later be stronger than his and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> prevent the strengthening of the Harel and Etzioni brigades to secure East Jerusalem. He redeployed his strength on 23 May to reinforce the blockade. The Iraqi army, at that time seconded by tanks, relieved the Legion units in northern Samaria and these were redeployed towards the Jerusalem sector. The 2nd Regiment of the Legion moved to Latrun. A full Jordanian brigade {{was placed in the}} area.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{struck his}} contemporaries as a sad figure, a loner with few friends in cricket. He rarely {{encouraged}} young players or gave out praise. He liked {{to mix with}} middle-class people, spending money he did not really have, leading to accusations of snobbery. Team-mates regarded him as moody, private and uncommunicative. Often silent {{in the company of}} others, he could be arrogant and unfriendly. Charlie Barnett and Charles Dacre, two of his Gloucestershire team-mates, came almost to hate him. Dacre often played in a reckless way of which Hammond disapproved; Hammond, in turn, may have been jealous of him. Hammond once tried hard to injure Dacre by bowling fast at him while he was wicketkeeper. Barnett began as a close friend but fell out over Hammond's treatment of his first wife and later his refusal to play in Barnett's benefit match. Other players who were involved in disputes with Hammond included Denis Compton, whose cavalier approach Hammond disliked, and Learie Constantine, who believed Hammond insulted him in the West Indies in 1925, although the two later made peace. Hammond's ultimate rivalry was with Bradman, who overshadowed him throughout his career, and with whom he developed an increasing obsession. It was not enough for Hammond to be the second-best batsman in the world, and he disliked the constant comparisons made between them in Bradman's favour. He felt not only <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do well, but also <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> score more than Bradman.|$|E

5|$|In 681, Constantine IV {{signed a}} {{treaty with the}} Bulgar khan Asparukh, and the new Bulgarian state assumed {{sovereignty}} {{over a number of}} Slavic tribes that had previously, at least in name, recognised Byzantine rule. In 687–688, the final Heraclian emperor, Justinian II, led an expedition against the Slavs and Bulgarians, and made significant gains, although the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fight his way from Thrace to Macedonia demonstrates the degree to which Byzantine power in the north Balkans had declined.|$|E
5|$|In October 1943, Cunningham became First Sea Lord of the Admiralty and Chief of the Naval Staff, {{after the}} death of Sir Dudley Pound. This {{promotion}} meant <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> relinquish his coveted post of Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, recommending his namesake Admiral John H. D. Cunningham as his successor. In the position of First Sea Lord, and {{as a member of the}} Chiefs of Staff committee, Cunningham was responsible for the overall strategic direction of the navy for the remainder of the war. He attended the major conferences at Cairo, Tehran, Yalta and Potsdam, at which the Allies discussed future strategy, including the invasion of Normandy and the deployment of a British fleet to the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

Gascoigne scored in his first match in China, and in total scored two goals in four league games but his mental state meant <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> return to America for treatment against drink and depression in April, and he never returned despite the club ordering him to do so.|$|E

He served as a {{lecturer}} at Western Kentucky University, and received the Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Louisville in 1999. During the late 1980s, he criticized Senator Mitch McConnell, one of the emerging leaders of the state's Republican party, for not doing more to support other Republicans in their bids for office; McConnell maintained <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> focus on his own reelection campaign in 1990. In 1988, Nunn unsuccessfully challenged Congressman Jim Bunning in his bid to retain his position as Kentucky's Republican national committeeman.|$|E

In February, Prevc was {{a member}} of the team that won the first ever World Cup team victory for Slovenia at the ski flying team event in Oberstdorf, together with Robert Kranjec, Jurij Tepeš, and Jure Šinkovec. Prevc jumped 225.5 meters (which would equal the hill record) in the one-series event but fell hard after the landing and injured his shoulder. He required an operation which meant <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> finish the season early and also missed out the Ski Flying World Championships in Vikersund.

5|$|Lucas {{explained}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{wait until}} the mid-1980s to make the film because visual effects technology was finally advanced enough to execute his vision. Meanwhile, actor-turned-director Ron Howard was looking to do a fantasy film. He was at Industrial Light & Magic during the post-production phase of Cocoon, {{when he was first}} approached by Lucas to direct Willow. He had previously starred in Lucas' American Graffiti, and Lucas felt that he and Howard shared a symbiotic relationship similar to the one he enjoyed with Steven Spielberg. Howard nominated Bob Dolman to write the screenplay based on Lucas' story. Dolman had worked with him on a 1983 television pilot called Little Shots that had not resulted in a series, and Lucas admired Dolman's work on the sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati.|$|E

5|$|On 20 November, Grayson reiterated {{his desire}} to keep Kisnorbo but stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> prove his fitness before being offered a new deal at Leeds.

However, on 11 March 2011, it was confirmed that he would not play again in the 2010–11 season. As Kisnorbo's contract was set to expire in June 2011, he had to prove his fitness to the coaching staff at Leeds in the hope of earning a new contract, or be free to join another club. In March 2011, Kisnorbo returned to full training with Leeds after his long spell out injured.|$|E
