The outcomes of the early <b>threshold</b> <b>treatment</b> for first cases of lameness were compared with those of the farmers’ conventional approach to treatment. The early threshold schedule resulted in a much shorter time to treatment than the conventional approach, for which the median time from the cow first being scored lame to treatment was 65 days.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of Amsterdam's methadone maintenance treatment is maximising its coverage among problematic opiate users. In order to evaluate what proportion is reached, the capture-recapture method is conducted to estimate the prevalence of problematic opiate use. Samples of opiate users in contact with police, hospital or treatment are used. The treatment sample {{is limited to the}} low <b>threshold</b> <b>treatment</b> sample (treatment with minimal requirements to the clients). Based on differences of log likelihood ratio, Akaike's and Bayesian information criteria, log linear models are selected. The size of the population of problematic opiate users in 1997 is estimated to be 4130 (95 % confidence interval: 3753 - 4566). Within 3 months 50 % was registered: 16 % at the police, 2. 5 % at the hospital and 40 % at treatment. This study shows that the Amsterdam methadone treatment programs succeed in reaching a high proportion of problematic opiate users. The estimation of the prevalence of problematic opiate users is considered to be valid. However, if, instead of the low <b>threshold</b> <b>treatment,</b> the total treatment sample had been used, the population of interest and the sampled population would not match correctly, and prevalence would have been overestimate...|$|E
40|$|The current <b>treatment</b> <b>threshold</b> for the glassy-winged {{sharpshooter}} (GWSS) as a vector of Pierce’s disease (PD) is one insect per tree in citrus. We developed {{a model to}} evaluate how the threshold might change in relation to various biological and ecological factors. The model was designed {{to determine the number}} of GWSS required to cause a single PD infection in grape. The primary model parameters were the proportion of GWSS carrying PD, GWSS transmission efficiency of PD, proportion of GWSS that will move from citrus to grape, the number of grapevines that a single GWSS will visit, grape varietal susceptibility, and the probability of an infection event resulting in disease. As these factors varied in the model, the GWSS <b>treatment</b> <b>threshold</b> changed. A major limitation of implementing <b>treatment</b> <b>thresholds</b> calculated from the model is that key data for some parameters are lacking.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{concept of}} risk {{thresholds}} {{has been studied}} in medical decision making for over 30 years. During that time, physicians {{have been shown to}} be poor at estimating the probabilities required to use this method. To better assess physician risk thresholds and to more closely model medical decision making, we set out to design and test a method that derives thresholds from actual physician treatment recommendations. Such an approach would avoid the need to ask physicians for estimates of patient risk when trying to determine individual <b>thresholds</b> for <b>treatment.</b> Assessments of physician decision making are increasingly relevant as new data are generated from clinical research. For example, recommendations made in the setting of ocular hypertension are of interest as a large clinical trial has identified new risk factors that should be considered by physicians. Precisely how physicians use this new information when making treatment recommendations has not yet been determined. Results We derived a new method for estimating <b>treatment</b> <b>thresholds</b> using ordinal logistic regression and tested it by asking ophthalmologists to review cases of ocular hypertension before expressing how likely they would be to recommend treatment. Fifty-eight physicians were recruited from the American Glaucoma Society. Demographic information was collected from the participating physicians and the <b>treatment</b> <b>threshold</b> for each physician was estimated. The method was validated by showing that while <b>treatment</b> <b>thresholds</b> varied over a wide range, the most common values were consistent with the 10 - 15 % 5 -year risk of glaucoma suggested by expert opinion and decision analysis. Conclusions This method has advantages over prior means of assessing <b>treatment</b> <b>thresholds.</b> It does not require physicians to explicitly estimate patient risk and it allows for uncertainty in the recommendations. These advantages will make it possible to use this method when assessing interventions intended to alter clinical decision making. </p...|$|R

In a laboratory experiment, we investigate {{the frequency and}} intensity of second- and third-order risk preferences, {{as well as the}} effect of the medical decision context. Risk preferences are assessed through <b>treatment</b> <b>thresholds</b> (the indifference point between not treating and treating). Under diagnostic risk, medical decision theory predicts lower <b>treatment</b> <b>thresholds</b> for risk-averse than for risk-neutral decision makers.

Nine large-scale field trials were conducted over a 3 -year period to determine if Dectes stem borer could be managed with insecticide treatments. Aerial applications of lambda on July 6, 12 and 15 were successful in significantly reducing adults, but applications on July 1, 20 and 24 were less successful. These data suggest that for central Kansas two aerial applications {{may be required to}} control Dectes stem borers in soybean. Based on our experience the first application should be made at the peak of adult flight about July 5 th and the second application 10 days later.

Three examiners evaluated whether the eye had undergone any laser photopexy in the macula. ■ RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity, and false-positive and false-negative results were calculated for each method. Fluorescein fundus angiography and infrared imaging, although using different approaches, both detect pigment epithelium changes such as laser scars. It seems that both methods are of equal specificity.

However, the population impact of an absolute risk-based strategy for BP lowering remains unclear. METHODS We examined 3 <b>treatment</b> <b>thresholds</b> using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. First, the JNC 8 guideline {{was used to determine}} treatment goals. Second, adults with a systolic BP (SBP) of 130 mm Hg and high cardiovascular risk (based on eligibility for SPRINT) were considered eligible for additional BP lowering. Finally, we combined the <b>treatment</b> <b>threshold</b> for high-risk adults with an SBP <b>treatment</b> <b>threshold</b> of 140 mm Hg for intermediate-risk adults that met the eligibility criteria for HOPE- 3. RESULTS Under the JNC 8 guideline, 78. 0 % of adults ≥ 50 years were at target while 22. 0 % were eligible for additional BP lowering. If an SBP <b>treatment</b> <b>threshold</b> of 130 mm Hg was used for adults at high cardiovascular risk, 31. 1 % would be eligible for additional BP lowering (an increase of 8. 1 million). If an SBP threshold of 140 mm Hg was additionally used for adults at intermediate risk, 31. 4 % of adults would be eligible for BP lowering (an increase of 8. 3 million). The proportion of adults eligible for BP lowering with established coronary artery disease decreased with the risk-based strategies.

40|$|Abstract. Studies were {{conducted}} on smallholder plots in northern Togo from 1988 to 1991 to determine the possibility of applying treatments according to action thresholds. Thresholds were defined for the following pests: H. armigera, D. watersi, €arias sp., S. derogata and A. gossypii. The threshold programme was compared to the routine insecticide application programme involving five applications fortnightly beginning 50 d. a. s. An u.

The results obtained showed that seed cotton yields were significantly different in 1991 (164 kg/ha less in the <b>threshold</b> <b>treatment</b> programme). Calculation shows that a reduction in treatments from five to three is not economical for the producer under the cropping conditions of the experiment.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to fault diagnosis {{for a class}} of nonlinear uncertain systems with triangular form is proposed in this paper. It {{is based on the}} extended state observer (ESO) of the active disturbance rejection controller and linearization of dynamic compensation. Firstly, an ESO is designed to jointly estimate the states and the combination of uncertainty, faults, and nonlinear function of nonlinear uncertain systems. It can derive the estimation of nonlinear function via the state estimations and system model. Then, linearization of dynamic compensation is employed to linearize the system by offsetting nonlinear function mandatorily using its estimation. An observer-based residual generator is designed {{on the basis of the}} prior linearized model for fault diagnosis. Moreover, <b>threshold</b> <b>treatment</b> technique is adopted to improve the robustness of fault diagnosis. This method is utilizable and simple in construction and parameter tuning. And also we show the construction of ESO and give the corresponding convergence proof succinctly.

A further condition varies the number of possible negotiating attempts, namely, 3 versus 5. Behavior in the lab diverges significantly from the theoretical solution in which the proposer is expected to get nearly the whole pie in each treatment. Proposers (responders) initially offer less (ask more) and concede more across negotiation attempts in the treatment in which concessions are required. Moreover, compulsory concessions weaken the bargaining position of the proposer, who eventually gets significantly less. Finally, although concessions significantly improve the likelihood of an agreement compared to standard ultimatum game experiments, the longer negotiation horizon (five attempts instead of three) delays the agreement without enhancing it, even when no concessions are needed...|$|R
40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} test and <b>treatment</b> <b>thresholds</b> for common acute primary care conditions. We presented 200 clinicians with a series of web-based clinical vignettes, describing patients with possible influenza, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and urinary tract infection (UTI). We randomly varied the probability of disease and asked whether the clinician wanted to rule out disease, order tests or rule in disease. By randomly varying the probability, we obtained clinical decisions across a broad range of disease probabilities that we used to create threshold curves. For influenza, the test (4. 5 % vs 32 %, p< 0. 001) and treatment (55 % vs 68 %, p= 0. 11) thresholds were lower for US compared with Swiss physicians. US physicians had somewhat higher test (3. 8 % vs 0. 7 %, p= 0. 107) and treatment (76 % vs 58 %, p= 0. 005) thresholds for ACS than Swiss physicians. For both groups, the range between test and <b>treatment</b> <b>thresholds</b> was greater for ACS than for influenza (which is sensible, given the consequences of incorrect diagnosis). For pneumonia, US physicians had a trend towards higher test <b>thresholds</b> and lower <b>treatment</b> <b>thresholds</b> (48 % vs 64 %, p= 0. 076) than Swiss physicians. The DVT and UTI scenarios did not provide easily interpretable data, perhaps due to poor wording of the vignettes. We have developed a novel approach for determining decision thresholds. We found important differences in thresholds for US and Swiss physicians that may be a function of differences in healthcare systems.

We presented clinicians with six web-based clinical scenarios, describing patients with HIV and possible TB at various sites and {{with a range of}} clinical stability. The probability of disease was varied randomly and clinicians asked to make <b>treatment</b> decisions; <b>threshold</b> curves and therapeutic thresholds were calculated. Test and <b>treatment</b> <b>thresholds</b> were calculated using Bayes theorem and the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF. We received 165 replies to our survey. Therapeutic thresholds vary depending on the clinical stability and site of suspected disease. For inpatients, it ranges from 3. 4 % in unstable to 79. 6 % in stable patients. For TB meningitis, it ranges from 0 % in unstable to 51. 4 % in stable patients and for pulmonary TB in outpatients it ranges from 29. 1 % in unstable to 74. 5 % in the stable patients. Test and <b>treatment</b> <b>thresholds</b> vary in a similar way with test thresholds ranging from 0 in unstable patients with suspected meningitis to 8. 2 % for stable inpatients. <b>Treatment</b> <b>thresholds</b> vary from 0 for unstable patients with suspected meningitis to 97 % for stable inpatients. Therapeutic thresholds for TB can be determined by presenting clinicians with patient scenarios with random probabilities of disease and can be used to calculate test and <b>treatment</b> <b>thresholds</b> using Bayes theorem.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{diagnosis}} of tuberculosis remains controversial between clinicians {{and public health}} officers. Public health officials fear to treat too many patients; clinicians fear that truly diseased will be denied treatment. We wondered whether {{an analysis of the}} <b>treatment</b> <b>threshold</b> could help making the often intuitive decision to treat smear-negative cases more evidence based. METHODS: Eighteen clinicians and 10 public health specialists were asked for an intuitive estimate of their <b>treatment</b> <b>threshold</b> for tuberculosis and of key determinant factors for this threshold: the magnitude and subjective weight of mortality and morbidity due to both the disease and the treatment and risk and cost of the latter. With these factors, the authors calculated <b>treatment</b> <b>thresholds</b> and compared them to the intuitive thresholds of the interviewees. A prescriptive threshold was calculated based on literature data, omitting cost and subjective factors. RESULTS: The median overall intuitive <b>treatment</b> <b>threshold</b> was 52. 5 %, the calculated 11. 9 %, and the prescriptive 2. 7 %. For 2 factors, public health officers provided significantly lower values than clinicians: cost of treatment (median = 20 dollars v. 300 dollars; U = 2. 5; P = 0. 0002); cost of life (median = 500 dollars v. 5000 dollars; U = 17. 5; P = 0. 009). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that clinicians and public health officers estimate wrongly the threshold even when using their own subjective estimate of influencing factors. Omitting treatment cost and subjective weight of provoked harm can result in a very low threshold. Sound training in threshold principles and providing tools to correctly assess data might help in making better decisions in tuberculosis in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Background - We {{conducted}} an independent external validation of three cardiovascular risk score models (Framingham risk score model and SCORE risk charts developed for low-risk regions and high-risk regions in Europe) on a prospective cohort of 4487 Australian women with no previous {{history of heart}} disease, diabetes or stroke. External validation {{is an important step}} to evaluate the performance of risk score models using discrimination and calibration measures to ensure their applicability beyond the settings in which they were developed. Methods - Ten year mortality follow-up of 4487 Australian adult women from the National Heart Foundation third Risk Factor Prevalence Study with no baseline history of heart disease, diabetes or stroke. The 10 -year risk of cardiovascular mortality was calculated using the Framingham and SCORE models and the predictive accuracy of the three risk score models were assessed using both discrimination and calibration. Results - The discriminative ability of the Framingham and SCORE models were good (area under the curve> 0. 85). Although all models overestimated the number of cardiovascular deaths by greater than 15 %, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated that the Framingham and SCORE-Low models were calibrated and hence suitable for predicting the 10 -year cardiovascular mortality risk in this Australian population. An assessment of the <b>treatment</b> <b>thresholds</b> {{for each of the three}} models in identifying participants recommended for treatment were found to be inadequate, with low sensitivity and high specificity resulting from the high recommended <b>thresholds.</b> Lower <b>treatment</b> <b>thresholds</b> of 8. 7 % for the Framingham model, 0. 8 % for the SCORE-Low model and 1. 3 % for the SCORE-High model were identified for each model using the Youden index, at greater than 78 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity. Conclusions - Framingham risk score model and SCORE risk chart for low-risk regions are recommended for use in the Australian women population for predicting the 10 -year cardiovascular mortality risk. These models demonstrate good discrimination and calibration performance. Lower <b>treatment</b> <b>thresholds</b> are proposed for better identification of individuals for treatment...|$|R
