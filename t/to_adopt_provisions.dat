Record companies and Hollywood studios have faced jurisdictional and legal problems in suing this network for copyright infringement. As Wired Magazine observes: ’The servers are in Denmark. The software is in Estonia. The domain is registered Down Under, the corporation on a tiny island in the South Pacific. The users - 60 million of them - are everywhere around the world. ' In frustration, copyright owners have launched copyright actions against intermediaries - like Internet Service Providers such as Verizon. They have also embarked on filing suits of individual users of file-sharing programs. In addition, copyright owners have called for domestic and international law reform in respect of digital copyright. The Senate Committee on Government Affairs in the United States Congress has reviewed the controversial use of subpoenas in suits against users of file-sharing peer to peer networks.

40|$|To {{mitigate}} the durability issues arising from steel reinforced structures, current {{research in the}} structural engineering field {{has been focused on}} the feasibility of replacing steel with corrosion resistant materials. A promising alternative has been glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars as internal reinforcement. While extensive testing has certified that GFRP bars perform adequately as tensile reinforcement, structural design codes have yet <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>provisions</b> for its implementation as compressive reinforcement. Quantifying the compressive behaviour of GFRP bars – the rela-tionship between strength and unbraced length, as well as the modulus of elasticity – {{is the first step toward}} developing code provisions. This experimental program consisted of 34 specimens of 25 M GFRP bars tested under di-rect compression; the lengths of the specimens were varied to establish the relationship between length and strength. A pure crushing failure with an ultimate compressive strength of 730 MPa was observed for all specimens under the nominal un-braced length of 230 mm. Longer specimens failed through a global buckling of the bar, with ultimate compressive strength decreasing with increasing unbraced bar length. The average compressive modulus of elasticity was determined to be 60 GPa. Manuscript edited by Karren Yang. Translated b...|$|E

Using a dataset of sovereign bond offerings from 1995 to early 2004, we test the importance of standardization for the modification provisions relating to payment terms.

The tax treatment of these cross-border transactions is affected by double tax agreements. As tax treaty networks will likely continue to expand, concerns about tax treaty abuse might be expected to grow. The extent to which a country’s tax treaty policy favours developing countries - or not - depends upon {{the extent to which the}} country is prepared <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>provisions</b> from the UN model tax convention as opposed to the OECD model. Developing countries, in particular, should carefully consider the design of their tax treaties so as to effectively combat tax avoidance without sacrificing foreign direct investment. To this end, the Canada/South Africa tax treaty is compared and contrasted with these two models. The concept of beneficial ownership is reviewed in this context. It is contended that a general definition in South Africa's Income Tax Act of 'beneficial ownership' would assist in the interpretation of the term for the purposes of South Africa's tax treaties. It is submitted that the scope for the source taxation of passive investment income (viz. dividends, interest and royalties) in the developing country could be magnified through treaty negotiations.

Sebelius – the Supreme Court’s {{decision}} {{upholding the}} individual mandate in Obamacare as a tax, with Arizona Christian Schools v. Winn – the Supreme Court’s decision denying standing to taxpayers with an Establishment Clause challenge {{to a state}} tax credit. It argues that these cases aggravate a growing tension between the economic and legal analyses of taxation by reducing the legal significance of economic analysis in constitutional cases. It suggests that Arizona Christian Schools was a truly radical decision because it conceptualized tax expenditures as private action immune from constitutional attack, rather than state action subject to constitutional limitations, making tax expenditures legally invisible. The article parses the Court’s economic and legal approach, and contends that the Court misunderstood the important issues. It explains how tax cuts are distinguishable from spending through the tax law, and why tax expenditures – in the aggregate – should be legally important. It argues that the Court’s approach to tax expenditures not only reduces the fundamental protection that the Constitution guarantees individuals, but also has other troubling legal and policy implications. These decisions weaken the revenue-raising role of taxation, blur the conceptual structure of the tax law, and undermine the tax reform efforts of other branches of government. They jeopardize established legal doctrine by destabilizing the precedents on unconstitutional conditions attached to tax benefits, which depend on conceiving tax benefits as government subsidies or privileges. These decisions encourage legislatures <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>provisions</b> that favor high-income taxpayers, while discouraging transparent and equitable government.

Previous studies revealed that wetlands and agricultural landuse dominated the landscape of Makurdi. However, the trend is changing in recent times. Makurdi has undergone tremendous transformation in its landuse/landcover due to rapid urbanization since 1976 when it became the capital city of Benue State. To estimate the land cover change in Makurdi, Landsat ETM, ETM+ and OLI satellite data for 1996, 2006 and 2016, respectively were utilised. The study adapted the Kappa index for assessing accuracy of the land use/cover maps generated from the analysis to improve the accuracy of results. An accuracy level of 80 to 91  % was achieved. The results reveal an overall significant increase in built-up area and other land uses at the expense of wetlands from 26. 3  % in 1996 to 18. 1  % in 2016. Further analysis includes the land consumption rate (LCR) and land absorption coefficient (LAC) which reveals the role of population expansion in the recorded levels of wetland losses recorded in this study. The study projects a further decline of wetland cover by 33. 15  km 2 (or by 22. 57  %) in 2026 if steps are not instituted to control the rate of decline. Suggestions are made to align with and incorporate into policy the strategic need <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> the <b>provisions</b> of the SDGs at local levels if we intend to avert the massive failure recorded by the now rested MDGs...|$|R
