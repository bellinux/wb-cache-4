5|$|They started {{recording}} Astraea in June at James Spence's {{house in}} Nottingham. They {{were forced into}} this situation as Sanderson's recording studio was taken from him through a contractual issue on the building with the landlord. The recording process was different from previous albums as {{there was a lot}} of production and pre-production involved. Sanderson would come to the practice sessions of the bands and make suggestions to the songs and then <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> record it. The album took three months to record because of band member's personal commitments, this to James Spence had a positive effect as the members took their time with the music, believing the album was more “produced” than previous efforts. James believed Rolo Tomassi had much more of an opportunity to experiment in the studio and try things they had never tried before. However, James had commented that the recording of the album in his house revealed to be a stressful decision. An example of this was were his basement- where all the recording equipment was- flooded due to heavy rainfall. Although nothing got damaged, stagnant water remained and they had to move the guitar cab to his bedroom. They recorded the drums upstairs at The Bodega in Nottingham then Rolo Tomassi then went to James and Eva Spence's parents house record the vocals, keyboard and pianos.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century Pashtun society was colonized, stagnant, violent, worn down by feuds, inequalities, factionalism, poor social cooperation, and plain ignorance. Education opportunities were strictly limited. Pashtuns are Muslims; and religious leaders and Mullahs were known to have told parents that if their children went to school, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> hell. Khan stated that “the real purpose of this propaganda” was to keep Pashtuns “illiterate and uneducated”, and hence his people “were the most backward in India” with regard to education. He also stated that by the time Islam reached his people centuries earlier, it had lost much of its original spiritual message.|$|E

EADS claimed that the HC-144 costs {{half as much as}} the C-27J to maintain and operate. The U.S. Forest Service also wanted 7 C-27Js for aerial firefighting. The U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) were interested in acquiring ex-USAF C-27Js.
