40|$|This project {{includes}} the design, fabrication, testing, {{and analysis of}} a custom tool that will allow individuals who work on automobiles and machines to have more versatility {{in the process of}} removing nuts and bolts. The tool works as a normal socket wrench as well as a linear <b>torque</b> <b>transmitter</b> through a secondary drive {{on the bottom of the}} wrench which transmits the torque from the bottom of the wrench to the socket head through the internal gear system without having to move the wrench itself. This tool will allow mechanics and machine repair professionals to remove difficult to access bolts more efficiently and in turn save them time and money. The gear system is designed and tested to transmit up to 120 foot pounds of torque which accounts for the majority of bolt removal tasks. A survey done on both people who work on automobiles as well as people who occasionally use a wrench for simple repairs will give a diverse input as to the practicality and ease of use of this custom tool. The results indicate the tool is definitely useful in special cases and can save adequate time in certain situations...|$|E

5000|$|The Mark 1A Fire Control Computer was an {{electro-mechanical}} analog ballistic computer. Originally {{designated the}} Mark 1, design modifications were extensive {{enough to change}} it to [...] "Mk. 1A". The Mark 1A appeared post World War II and may have incorporated technology developed for the Bell Labs Mark 8, Fire Control Computer. Sailors would stand around a box 62 inches long, 38 inches wide, and 45 inches high. Even though built with extensive use of an aluminum alloy framework (including thick internal mechanism support plates) and computing mechanisms mostly made of aluminum alloy, it weighed {{as much as a}} car, about 3125 lb, with the Star Shell Computer Mark 1 adding another 215 lb. It used 115 volts AC, 60 Hz, single phase, and typically a few amperes or even less. Under worst-case fault conditions, its synchros apparently could draw as much as 140 amperes, or 15,000 watts (about the same as 3 houses while using ovens). Almost all of the computer's inputs and outputs were by synchro <b>torque</b> <b>transmitters</b> and receivers.|$|R
40|$|The {{quest for}} energy {{efficiency}} {{leads to the}} development of highly efficient power transmissions for vehicles. Gears {{are some of the most}} rugged and durable <b>torque</b> <b>transmitters</b> among machine elements. Friction between sliding surfaces at gear teeth is one major source of power loss. To increase efficiency and reduce damage accumulation in gears has always been a background motivation to this thesis. It focuses on the frictional performance of manufactured gear surfaces with emphasis on the effect of surface topography and the orientation of its lay. To achieve the goal of this work, a test rig was designed and constructed. The rig makes it possible to examine gear tooth friction on double crowned rollers. Five alternative gear-finishing processes are implemented in roller surface preparation. They comprise grinding, shotpeening, phosphating, chemical deburring and DLC coating. Theoretically, a friction model is suggested which helps to explain some of the testing results. Advanced surface metrology techniques and statistical tools are implemented in identifying surface features that influence friction. The result demonstrates that surface topography is a significant factor affecting the lubricated frictional behaviour. For ground-finishing, the smoother the surfaces are finished, the lower friction coefficient they show. Chemical deburring and DLC coating as well as certain degrees of phosphating provide minimum friction coefficient and improved load carrying capacity, which are competitive to fine-ground finishing. Properly designed lay combinations of meshing gear surfaces can minimise friction and improve gear transmission efficiency. Theoretically, the friction coefficient can be explained by means of a combination of the slide-to-roll ratio and the real mean contact pressure within the range of loads considered in this thesis. Finally, features that correlate surface topography to friction are identified...|$|R
