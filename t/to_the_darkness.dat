5|$|Prior to the operation, {{a raid on}} the French {{coastal town}} of Dieppe had placed the German occupying forces on a high state of alert, and this {{ultimately}} contributed to Aquatint's failure. The commandos were also unable to identify their correct landing place due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness.</b> Within minutes of landing, the raiding party was ambushed by a German patrol and forced {{to try to reach}} their Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) transport. The MTB was located and engaged by the German shore batteries, which damaged one of its engines. It was forced to withdraw, leaving the commandos behind. At the end of the raid those commandos who had not been killed all became prisoners of war. Only five of the raiding force would survive the war; one was killed in captivity and the fate of the other two is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} moves from world to world, eradicating the Heartless, Chirithy has brief conversations {{with one of}} the Foretellers and another Chirithy {{regarding}} concerning events. Once in a while, the player return to Daybreak Town where they meet another Keyblade wielder named , who is part of a rival union. He wishes to explore a mysterious tower that lies within the center of the town, and against Chirithy's wishes, the player agrees to help find a way in. Ephemer, however, abandons the player to explore the tower himself. During the player's exploration, the tower is discovered to be the base of the Foretellers, and while there, the player is confronted by Master Ava, the Foreteller they had met previously. She challenges the player to test their strength, and afterwards tells the player they have sadness in their hearts, which links them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness.</b> Undeterred, the player continues their mission and later meets another Keyblade wielder named , who comes from Ephemer's union. She expresses an interest in further exploring the mysterious tower of the Foretellers. She and the player encounter warring Foretellers from different unions and new kinds of Heartless that are revealed to be corrupted Keyblade wielders as well as a dark vision of Chirithy called Nightmare Chirithy (who is the same Chirithy that had been speaking with the player's).|$|E

25|$|The hall {{they built}} used modernism’s {{favourite}} material, reinforced concrete, alongside more luxurious elements including beautiful woods and Derbyshire fossilised limestone. The {{exterior of the}} building was bright white, intended to contrast with the blackened city surrounding it. Large areas of glass on its façade meant that light coursed freely throughout the interior, and at night, the glass let the light from inside flood out onto the river, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> which befell the rest of London after dusk.|$|E
25|$|A {{long time}} ago, the Apprentice (Timothy Webber) is {{sweeping}} a vault, when an unknown Dark One intrudes, later {{revealed to be}} Zoso. The Dark One knocks him aside and attempts to open a box, but is repelled by an enchantment placed on it by The Sorcerer. The Apprentice tells the Dark One that the box cannot be opened by someone who has succumbed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> in their heart. The Dark One vanishes in a rage, and the Apprentice says that no Dark One will ever open the box.|$|E

Mammals of the desert include the southern hairy-nosed wombat which shelters from the hot sun by burrowing into the sands, as well as typical desert animals such as red kangaroos and dingoes. An elusive subspecies of the Australian masked owl unique to the Nullarbor is known to roost in the many caves on the plain. The grasslands of the Nullarbor are suitable for some sheep grazing and are also damaged by rabbits.|$|E

25|$|When {{compared}} to other literary vampires of the 19th century, Carmilla is a similar product of a culture with strict sexual mores and tangible religious fear. While Carmilla selected exclusively female victims, she only becomes emotionally involved with a few. Carmilla had nocturnal habits, but was not confined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness.</b> She had unearthly beauty, {{and was able to}} change her form and to pass through solid walls. Her animal alter ego was a monstrous black cat, not a large dog as in Dracula. She did, however, sleep in a coffin. Carmilla works as a Gothic horror story because her victims are portrayed as succumbing to a perverse and unholy temptation that has severe metaphysical consequences for them.|$|E
25|$|In the Vault of the Dark One, the Darkness enters Hook, {{making him}} {{remember}} {{all of the}} darkest moments of his life, including the time when Rumplestiltskin killed Milah and took his hand, when Rumplestiltskin took his heart {{as part of a}} (failed) plan to absorb Emma into Merlin's hat, and when Emma became the Dark One. This causes him to scream in agony, before he emerges outside of the Vault from dark energy, as the newest Dark One. Like Emma, he is greeted by a manifestation of Rumplestiltskin, who offers Hook a chance to seek revenge on the living Rumplestiltskin, but Hook is reluctant to take up the challenge, knowing what the manifestation is, and not wanting to give in <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Devourer of Time is the {{creature}} resulting from Lavos absorbing Schala. Lavos returns {{as the main}} villain, but does not appear until the end. By accident during Chrono Trigger, Schala was banished <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> of time, where later, {{the remnants of the}} defeated Lavos arrived and began absorbing the former princess of Zeal to create a new being. The resulting life-form — the Time Devourer — would have been capable of devouring all spacetime once matured. Though unknown to Serge for most of his quest, the entire events concerning the dimensions and the creation of El Nido were set in motion to empower him to defeat the Time Devourer and free Schala. Using the Chrono Cross, he accomplished this mission. In DS port of Chrono Trigger, the Devourer of Time is shown in a less advanced stage of its evolution, named the Dream Devourer.|$|E

25|$|Despite setbacks, Snow and Emma {{get back}} to Storybrooke. However, Cora and Hook follow after them, framing Regina for the faked murder of Archie to draw her back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness.</b> Mr. Gold calls in the favor Emma owes him. Emma and Henry {{accompany}} Gold to Manhattan, where it's discovered Emma's ex-lover, Neal, is Gold's son. In Storybrooke, Cora and Regina trick Snow and David into giving them the Dark One dagger; however, Hook followed Gold to Manhattan and poisoned him. With Gold dying, Snow decides to use a magic candle to give him Cora's life to save her family from the evil woman. Regina tries seeking revenge, but is convinced by Henry not to as it would perpetuate {{nothing more than a}} senseless cycle of murder and revenge. Seeing Regina is prone to giving into her evil side, everyone decides to keep the magic beans they're growing a secret, so they can leave her behind in Storybrooke and head back to the Enchanted Forest.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Belle {{returns to}} Gold and forgives him. However, after Emma hears the whispers of the dagger, she meets with Gold, who reveals {{the truth to}} Emma, about him using a magic potion to turn Excalibur into a conduit, so that when Emma killed all of the Dark Ones, their magic was {{transferred}} into Gold, allowing Gold to reclaim his life as the Dark One, and creating a new Dagger in the process, with a reversed color scheme of a black blade with silver engravings. (Excalibur was still tethered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Darkness,</b> so when Gold became the Dark One again, the Dagger reappeared.) He adds that he is more powerful than ever before, since he now wields the combined power of every Dark One that ever lived including her. Emma is very cross about this and tells him that she now has leverage over Gold, threatening to tell Belle at any moment the truth about her husband. In exchange for Emma keeping the secret, Gold agrees to help her enter the Underworld to rescue Hook. At the lake, Emma is joined by Gold, Regina, Mary Margaret, David, Robin, and Henry, as they approach the ferry to descend into the Underworld.|$|E
25|$|In the field, Hook {{says that}} he doesn't {{want to become a}} Dark One, that he's weak, unlike Merlin and Emma, and that he'll succumb <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{darkness}}</b> again if she does that. Emma {{says that he}} won't, that she'll help him fight it together, and that she still wants a future with him. But Hook tells her not to, that their future is now, and that he’s happy just to know that she has one, before going limp. Emma says that it's not enough for her. She holds him and cries, and then takes Excalibur and floods it with magic. In the diner, Merlin tells them it’s too late, and tendrils of darkness emerge from him as he is released from Excalibur (the darkness was what bound Merlin to the fragment of Excalibur). The dark tendrils re-emerge from Excalibur and flow into Killian's heart, bathing him in a golden light. Then, Hook vanishes and his name appears on the blade of Excalibur. Then, a burst of dark magic erupts from the blade of Excalibur, turning Emma into her present-day appearance, with white hair and a dark appearance, signifying the completion of her journey into darkness. At the same time, a flood of dark energy pours into the entrance of the Vault of the Dark One, and reforms into a cloaked Killian.|$|E
25|$|That night, {{the people}} of Storybrooke are all celebrating at Granny's diner. Lily tells Emma that she wants <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> {{identity}} of her father and plans on staying in Storybrooke during her search. Belle shows up to tell everyone that {{the last bit of}} humanity in Gold's heart is about to be consumed by <b>the</b> <b>Darkness,</b> and <b>the</b> group finds Gold unconscious in his shop. The Apprentice then removes Gold's nearly-black heart from his chest, and uses his power <b>to</b> pull <b>the</b> <b>Darkness</b> out of Gold's heart and transfer it into the Sorcerer’s Hat, which severs Gold's link <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dagger of Kris in the process. He then puts a pure white heart back into Gold, and casts a preservation spell on Gold, to keep him alive while they figure out how to help him recover. However, the hat is unable <b>to</b> contain <b>the</b> <b>Darkness,</b> and it breaks out, before attacking and entering the Apprentice. Emma uses her light magic <b>to</b> force <b>the</b> <b>Darkness</b> back out of the Apprentice, and <b>the</b> <b>Darkness</b> exits <b>the</b> shop. As the Apprentice lies dying, he tells Emma and Hook that, long ago, centuries before their births, the Sorcerer battled <b>the</b> <b>Darkness</b> and tethered it to a human soul with the Dark One's Dagger, and now that it's free, the only person who can prevent <b>the</b> <b>Darkness</b> from destroying all the realms is the Sorcerer himself: Merlin.|$|R

50|$|In the Enchanted Forest, {{before the}} first curse, Snow White and Prince Charming come across a unicorn and touch its horn <b>to</b> see what <b>the</b> future holds for their unborn child. Charming sees a happy baby Emma, but Snow sees a vision of Emma ripping out Snow's heart and {{crushing}} it to dust. Later on, the couple run into a peddler, who tells them that Maleficent has transformed into a dragon and has laid an egg. The merchant then advises <b>the</b> couple <b>to</b> follow a path that leads them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Apprentice's cottage. The Apprentice tells the Charmings that their child is a blank slate, and either one of their premonitions could come true, but adds {{that it is possible}} <b>to</b> banish <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> from a child, and {{in order to do that}} they would have to find another blank slate <b>to</b> contain <b>the</b> <b>darkness.</b> Snow begins <b>to</b> believe that Maleficent's egg is <b>the</b> ideal vessel <b>to</b> take on <b>the</b> <b>darkness,</b> as it will only grow into a heartless monster anyway.|$|R
500|$|During a later event (February 2016), {{the player}} {{is sent to}} defeat Heartless in the Corridors of Darkness and Chirithy {{presents}} them with the Bracelet of Light, which can {{protect them from the}} darkness, but only temporarily.

500|$|In the {{following}} duet the voices are homophonic {{for most of}} the time, but with little rhythmical differences, showing their different attitude <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> of the grave (...) : the alto expresses [...] "" [...] (I truly fear) on steady long notes, whereas the tenor tells in ornamented figuration [...] "" [...] (I do not fear). In the continuation they also deviate only on one word, [...] "" [...] (lamented) in the alto, [...] "" [...] (hoped) in the tenor. The flowing 12/8 time signature of the duet and a virtuoso solo violin are reminiscent of the original purpose of the music in the congratulatory cantata. It is most fitting for the middle section of the da capo form, when both voices agree: [...] "" [...] (Now my heart is full of comfort).|$|E
500|$|Dead Head Fred {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. [...] The game's writing and dialogue were considered the main {{strengths of the}} game, with GameSpy's reviewer stating that [...] "In the vast sea of PSP titles, Dead Head Fred stands 'head and shoulders' above the rest." [...] IGN said [...] "The tale of revenge in a dark world is twisted [...] unapologetically humorous". [...] Other publications were not as impressed, however, with one reviewer stating [...] "...the overused profanity just makes it feel like it's been designed by teenagers desperately trying to be edgy." [...] The game's supernatural themes elicited comparisons <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Darkness</b> and Grim Fandango. GamesRadar included it in their list of the 100 most overlooked games of its generation. Editor Jason Fanelli felt that PSP games often lacked creativity and that Dead Head Fred was the exception.|$|E
