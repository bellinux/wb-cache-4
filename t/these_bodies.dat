5|$|The Constitution of the Soviet Union {{recognised}} the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and {{the earlier}} Central Executive Committee (CEC) of the Congress of Soviets {{as the highest}} organs of state authority in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Under the 1924, 1936 and 1977 Soviet Constitution <b>these</b> <b>bodies</b> served as the collective head of state of the Soviet Union. The Chairman of <b>these</b> <b>bodies</b> personally performed the largely ceremonial functions assigned to a single head of state but held little real power.|$|E
5|$|All {{bodies were}} in similar flexed {{positions}} lying on their left sides with knees raised up towards their chin. In comparison, most bodies excavated from Egypt {{dating to the}} predynastic period are in a similar position, however at Merimda Beni Salama and El-Amra bodies were found on their right sides. From the time <b>these</b> <b>bodies</b> were buried up until the Middle Kingdom period, the dead were laid on their sides. After this period they were buried on their backs (dorsal position), and from the Fifth Dynasty the bodies were always fully extended.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{planetary}} formation epoch the inner Solar System was populated by 50–100 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Further growth was possible only because <b>these</b> <b>bodies</b> collided and merged, which took less than 100million years. These objects would have gravitationally interacted with one another, tugging at each other's orbits until they collided, growing larger until the four terrestrial planets we know today took shape. One such giant collision is thought to have formed the Moon (see Moons below), while another removed the outer envelope of the young Mercury.|$|E

50|$|The tooth itself {{cannot be}} {{authenticated}} {{as that of}} John the Baptist, who was purportedly beheaded in the 1st century CE. Since then, people have claimed to own his various body parts, including his entire head. Many of <b>these</b> <b>body</b> parts are on display {{in various parts of}} the world. The identification of <b>these</b> <b>body</b> parts is further complicated by the uncertainty surrounding whether his head was initially buried with the rest of his body. Possible grave sites have been identified, but the head may have been buried elsewhere.|$|R

5|$|Between 1942 and 1944 {{large numbers}} of Allied service {{personnel}} were buried in the military section of Brookwood cemetery. On the authority of Thomas B. Larkin, Quartermaster General of the United States Army, 3,600 bodies of US servicemen were exhumed in January–May 1948 and shipped to the United States for reburial. The railway service had been suspended in 1941, and North station (renamed North Bar after the ending of rail services) {{was used as a}} temporary mortuary to hold <b>these</b> <b>bodies</b> while awaiting shipment to the USA.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, in a {{paper in}} Astrophysics: A Topical Symposium, Gerard Kuiper speculated on a similar disc having formed early in the Solar System's evolution, {{but he did not}} think that such a belt still existed today. Kuiper was {{operating}} on the assumption, common in his time, that Pluto was the size of Earth and had therefore scattered <b>these</b> <b>bodies</b> out toward the Oort cloud or out of the Solar System. Were Kuiper's hypothesis correct, there would not be a Kuiper belt today.|$|E
5|$|It {{was noted}} that the naming process would remain stalled without such rules, and that even with them, few of <b>these</b> <b>bodies</b> can be imaged with {{sufficient}} resolution to determine their shapes. Therefore, the IAU announced in 2008 that for naming purposes, a trans-Neptunian object will be {{assumed to be a}} plutoid if it has an absolute magnitude brighter than H = +1 magnitude.|$|E
40|$|We {{cast the}} problem of {{recognizing}} related categories as a unified learning and structured prediction problem with shared body plans. When provided with detailed annotations of objects and their parts, <b>these</b> <b>body</b> plans model objects in terms of shared parts and layouts, simultaneously capturing a variety of categories in varied poses. We can use <b>these</b> <b>body</b> plans to jointly train many detectors in a shared framework with structured learning, leading to significant gains for each supervised task. Using our model, we can provide detailed predictions of objects and their parts for both familiar and unfamiliar categories. 1...|$|R

5000|$|The Ion {{is notable}} for being highly customizable: it is {{sheathed}} in a removable polymer shell, which comes {{in several different}} colors. This shell can also be replaced with aftermarket [...] "body kits" [...] to change {{the appearance of the}} Ion, similar to the kits available for the Tippmann A5 marker and others. <b>These</b> <b>body</b> kits also affect the performance of the gun and accessibility of the bolt. Body kits such as the lucky and deadlywinds are BOB ( [...] bolt out the back) allow for easy access and cleaning of the bolt. In addition to <b>these</b> <b>body</b> kits, several aftermarket replacement parts (such as triggers and feednecks) are available.|$|R
5|$|Jupiter's {{extensive}} magnetosphere envelops its {{ring system}} and the orbits of all four Galilean satellites. Orbiting near the magnetic equator, <b>these</b> <b>bodies</b> serve as sources and sinks of magnetospheric plasma, while energetic particles from the magnetosphere alter their surfaces. The particles sputter off material from the surfaces and create chemical changes via radiolysis. The plasma's co-rotation with the planet means that the plasma preferably interacts with the moons' trailing hemispheres, causing noticeable hemispheric asymmetries. In addition, the large internal magnetic fields of the moons contribute to the Jovian magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Large {{deposits}} {{of fossil fuels}} are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas. These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust {{through a process of}} ore genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics. <b>These</b> <b>bodies</b> form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful elements.|$|E
5|$|Official bodies {{such as the}} European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Test Methods of the European Commission, the Interagency Coordinating Committee for the Validation of Alternative Methods in the US, ZEBET in Germany, and the Japanese Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (among others) also {{promote and}} {{disseminate}} the 3Rs. <b>These</b> <b>bodies</b> are mainly driven by responding to regulatory requirements, such as supporting the cosmetics testing ban in the EU by validating alternative methods.|$|E

40|$|Microseisms are the {{continuous}} background vibrations of the Earth observed between earthquakes. Most microseism {{studies have focused}} on low frequency energy (0. 05 – 0. 5 Hz) propagating as surface waves, but in the microseism spectrum there is also energy that propagates as body waves (P-waves). Using array analysis on southern California stations we show that <b>these</b> <b>body</b> waves are generated in the ocean from distant storms and propagate deep within the Earth's mantle and core as P, PP and PKP phases. Comparisons with ocean wave hindcast data identify several distinct source regions in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Analyses of <b>these</b> <b>body</b> waves demonstrate that microseisms often have a strong P-wave component originating from distant locations. <br/...|$|R
50|$|In a {{thorough}} visual body cavity search, a flashlight {{is used to}} illuminate body orifices, including nostrils, ears, mouth, navel, penis (urethra and foreskin) or vagina, and rectum. Generally, the detainee is required to manipulate <b>these</b> <b>body</b> parts {{so that they can}} be examined.|$|R
5|$|Only two of <b>these</b> <b>bodies,</b> Ceres and Pluto, {{have been}} {{observed}} in enough detail to demonstrate that they actually fit the IAU's definition. The IAU accepted Eris as a dwarf planet {{because it is more}} massive than Pluto. They subsequently decided that unnamed trans-Neptunian objects with an absolute magnitude brighter than +1 (and hence a diameter of ≥838km assuming a geometric albedo of ≤1) are to be named under the assumption that they are dwarf planets.|$|E
5|$|The Central Committee {{was not a}} {{permanent}} institution. It convened plenary sessions. Seven CC plenary sessions and two plenary sessions held {{in conjunction with the}} convening of the Central Control Commission were held between the 16th Congress and the 17th Congress. When the CC was not in session, decision-making power was vested in the internal bodies of the CC itself; that is, the Politburo, Secretariat and Orgburo. None of <b>these</b> <b>bodies</b> were permanent either; typically they convened several times a month.|$|E
5|$|The {{stricken}} airliner crashed onto Mount Bliss in the San Gabriel Mountains at {{an elevation}} of approximately , where {{the bulk of the}} wreckage landed in a gorge. Fire department officials sent search and rescue helicopters to the crash site, but efforts were hampered by thick fog. Nine bodies were initially found at the crash site, a number of them intact and still strapped into their seats. News reports indicated that <b>these</b> <b>bodies</b> had apparently been thrown clear on impact, and had come to rest alongside the tail section of the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Blood {{from the}} {{slaughtered}} guilt offering {{was placed on}} the right ear, right thumb and right big toe of the metzora (Leviticus 14:14) The need for this to be done was cause for some complication, because the metzora was not allowed into Temple grounds prior to his purification process and the blood of the offering was not allowed out of the Temple grounds. To reconcile this dilemma, the metzora stuck <b>these</b> <b>body</b> parts through the gateway one at a time to receive the blood. The same was done with the oil from the flour offerings of the metzora. If the metzora lost any of <b>these</b> <b>body</b> parts after he was ready for purification, he could never obtain purification (Mishnah Nega'im 14:9).|$|R
50|$|From {{conception}} {{and to the}} third week, the most susceptible systems and organs are the brain, spinal cord, and heart.

5|$|Based {{on their}} orbital characteristics, short-period comets {{are thought to}} {{originate}} from the centaurs and the Kuiper belt/scattered disc —a disk of objects in the trans-Neptunian region—whereas the source of long-period comets {{is thought to be}} the far more distant spherical Oort cloud (after the Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort who hypothesised its existence). Vast swarms of comet-like bodies are thought to orbit the Sun in these distant regions in roughly circular orbits. Occasionally the gravitational influence of the outer planets (in the case of Kuiper belt objects) or nearby stars (in the case of Oort cloud objects) may throw one of <b>these</b> <b>bodies</b> into an elliptical orbit that takes it inwards toward the Sun to form a visible comet. Unlike the return of periodic comets, whose orbits have been established by previous observations, the appearance of new comets by this mechanism is unpredictable.|$|E
5|$|But geology also {{provided}} an alternate route, albeit across foreign territory. The valleys of the Red and Minnesota Rivers {{lay in the}} beds of Glacial Lake Agassiz and its prehistoric outlet Glacial River Warren; the lands exposed when <b>these</b> <b>bodies</b> of water receded were flat plains between low uplands covered by prairie grasslands. At the Traverse Gap, only a mile (1.6 km) of land separated the Bois des Sioux River, a source stream of the Red (which flowed north to Hudson Bay) and the Little Minnesota River, a source stream of the Minnesota River (tributary to the Mississippi, which flowed south to the Gulf of Mexico). The valley floors and uplands of the watercourses along this gently graded route provided a natural thoroughfare to the south. The eyes of the colonists therefore turned to the new United States, both {{as a source of}} supplies and an (illegal) outlet for their furs.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Santiago's {{military}} prosecutor {{prohibited the}} unmarked bodies from being incinerated or removed, though Walkowitz and Knauer wrote in Memory and the Impact of Political Transformation in Public Space {{that the military}} government dug up and hid hundreds of <b>these</b> <b>bodies</b> in 1982. Following the end of military rule and return of democracy to Chile in 1990, investigation of human rights violations became a top priority. Though a 1978 amnesty decree prevented prosecution for pre-1978 offenses, the new Aylwin government sought disclosure of the truth and recompense for the victim's families and appointed a National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation. The commission's February 1991 Rettig Report named victims disappeared shortly after the coup, executed by gunshot, and presumed {{to be buried in}} Patio 29. Patio 29 was the largest of about twelve Pinochet era mass graves identified and searched.|$|E
50|$|Example: Kretschmer's {{classification}} system {{was based on}} three main body types: asthenic/leptosomic (thin, small, weak), athletic (muscular, large-boned), and pyknic (stocky, fat). (The athletic category was later combined into the category asthenic/leptosomic.) Each of <b>these</b> <b>body</b> types was associated with certain personality traits and, in a more extreme form, psychopathologies.|$|R
50|$|Vestigial {{structures}} are anatomical structures of organisms in a species which {{are considered to}} have lost much or all of their original function through evolution. <b>These</b> <b>body</b> parts can be classed as additional to the required functioning of the body.

50|$|In August 2005, a Miami-based start-up, Lease Your Body, was {{launched}} by Alex Fisher. Lease Your Body allowed advertisers to meet good-looking {{people willing to}} rent out space on their bodies, including necks, upper arms, forearms, hands, stomachs, lower backs, and foreheads, for temporary tattoo placement. Rates for <b>these</b> <b>body</b> parts cost anywhere from $100 to $5,000.|$|R
5|$|Ions in ionic {{compounds}} {{are primarily}} {{held together by}} the electrostatic forces between the charge distribution of <b>these</b> <b>bodies,</b> {{and in particular the}} ionic bond resulting from the long-ranged Coulomb attraction between the net negative charge of the anions and net positive charge of the cations. There is also a small additional attractive force from van der Waals interactions which contributes only around 1–2% of the cohesive energy for small ions. When a pair of ions comes close enough for their outer electron shells (most simple ions have closed shells) to overlap, a short-ranged repulsive force occurs, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The balance between these forces leads to a potential energy well with a minimum energy when the nuclei are separated by a specific equilibrium distance.|$|E
5|$|Lakes in the {{watershed}} of Leggetts Creek include the Griffin Reservoir, Maple Lake, and Summit Lake. <b>These</b> <b>bodies</b> of water are in South Abington Township and Scott Township. The Griffin Reservoir supplies water {{to people in}} the Leggetts Creek watershed. The creek and the reservoir serve as a supplemental drinking water supply for more than 100,000 people as of the late 20th century. A spring known as Fountain Springs is in {{the watershed}} in South Abington Township. The Justus Meadows are in the watershed in Scott Township. Most of the watershed is developed, but there are still a few undeveloped reaches of the creek.|$|E
5|$|Mike Brown {{counters}} {{these claims}} by saying that, far from not having cleared their orbits, the major planets completely control {{the orbits of}} the other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist {{with a large number}} of small bodies in its orbit (the Trojan asteroids), but <b>these</b> <b>bodies</b> only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the sway of the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits. The orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant.|$|E
