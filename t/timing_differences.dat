500|$|Though {{previous}} Steely Dan {{projects were}} often recorded live, Fagen opted to overdub each part separately for The Nightfly. It became enormously difficult, between this approach {{and the new}} technology, to record the album. Pianist Michael Omartian [...] "objected strongly" [...] when Fagen tasked him to [...] "set the groove" [...] of the title track on his own, with nothing but a click track. On another occasion, Fagen [...] "demanded subtle <b>timing</b> <b>differences</b> between the left and right-hand piano parts" [...] on [...] "Ruby Baby". The effect he desired was achieved with Omartian and Greg Phillinganes playing together on the same keyboard. For the [...] "party noises" [...] in [...] "Ruby Baby", the team suspended a microphone from the ceiling of Studio 54 – just {{next door to the}} studio they were working – and recorded one of Jerry Rubin's 'business parties.' Unsatisfied with the results, the group instead held a party in the studio by themselves and included that ambience in the song. Larry Carlton performs lead guitar on much of the album, and recorded his pieces in four days. During his time with the group, he discovered a humming sound coming from his amplifier. The engineers discovered the source {{on the outside of the}} building: a large magnet [...] "that formed part of the New York subway system." [...] In one instance, a strange smell permeated the studio space at Soundworks. The studio staff [...] "gutted" [...] the studio, removing its air conditioning, carpeting, and recording console until they discovered the cause of the smell: a deceased rat in a drainpipe. Sessions often stretched long into the evening; Fagen would often refer to this as [...] "being on the night train." [...] In the end, the album took eight months to record, and was mixed in 10 days.|$|E

40|$|In mammals, each {{olfactory}} bulb (OB) contains {{a pair of}} mirror-symmetric glomerular maps organized to reflect odorant receptor identity. The functional implication of maintaining these symmetric medial-lateral maps within each OB remains unclear. Here, using in vivo multielectrode recordings to simultaneously detect odorant-induced activity across the entire OB, we reveal a <b>timing</b> <b>difference</b> in the odorant-evoked onset latencies between the medial and lateral halves. Interestingly, the latencies in the medial and lateral OB decreased at different rates as odorant concentration increased, causing the <b>timing</b> <b>difference</b> between them to also diminish. As a result, output neurons in the medial and lateral OB fired with greater synchrony at higher odorant concentrations.

30|$|The {{temperature}} drift of the etalon gap spacing can be monitored using the observed airglow fringes {{as shown in}} Eq. (3). This drift causes systematic offset on the horizontal wind velocities, because the horizontal wind is estimated from the difference of the fringe peak location between north and south. However, this systematic offset seems to be small. For example, {{even if there is}} a large etalon gap drift that corresponds to 100 m s− 1 in one hour, it causes systematic offset of only 2 m s− 1 for FP 01 (<b>timing</b> <b>difference</b> of 1.25 min between north and south) and 6 m s− 1 for FP 02 –FP 04 (<b>timing</b> <b>difference</b> of 3.45 min between north and south). However, this etalon gap drift directly affects the vertical wind measurements, as shown in Figs. 7 (e) and 8 (e). This effect may be avoided by installing a slow feedback heater around the etalon box or by considering the fact that the {{temperature drift}} is a rather slow effect compared with that of auroral vertical winds.|$|R

30|$|The primary aim of {{developing}} the AWESOME technique was to analyse the entire ULF wave spectra and provide an estimate of uncertainty in the onset time, in addition to setting an objective and quantitative onset criteria. We note here {{that there is no}} overlap in uncertainty between the onsets of the different ULF wave bands, demonstrating that the onset of Pi 1 - 2 waves occurs prior to Pi 2 waves, and both occur prior to the higher frequency Pi 1 wave band consistent with previous studies at single stations (Murphy et al. 2009 a, b; Rae et al. 2009 a, b; Walsh et al. 2010). We conclude that the Pi 1 - 2 waves are linked to the formation and evolution of auroral beads and are therefore onset driven (e.g. Rae et al. 2009 a, b), whereas the longer period Pi 2 waves {{may be related to the}} evolution of the large-scale current system that develops following onset, most likely the substorm current wedge (e.g. McPherron et al. 1973; Rae et al. 2007; Murphy et al. 2013). The <b>timing</b> <b>difference</b> between auroral beads and auroral breakup during which the SCW begins to form is similar to <b>timing</b> <b>difference</b> between the onset of the Pi 1 - 2 and Pi 2 wave bands; beads and Pi 1 / 2 waves occurring contemporaneously and auroral breakup and Pi 2 waves occurring 2 – 3  min later. This further supports our conclusion that Pi 1 - 2 waves are linked to the auroral beads and Pi 2 waves are linked to the SCW. Presumably in this scenario, Pi 1 waves correspond to the later structuring and filamentation of the current systems that develop into auroral breakup (e.g. Arnoldy et al. 1987; Bösinger 1989).|$|R
40|$|We {{observed}} nine primary transits {{of the hot}} Jupiter TrES- 3 b {{in several}} optical and near-UV photometric bands from 2009 June to 2012 April {{in an attempt to}} detect its magnetic field. Vidotto, Jardine and Helling suggest that the magnetic field of TrES- 3 b can be constrained if its near-UV light curve shows an early ingress compared to its optical light curve, while its egress remains unaffected. Predicted magnetic field strengths of Jupiter-like planets should range between 8 G and 30 G. Using these magnetic field values and an assumed B_star of 100 G, the Vidotto et al. method predicts a <b>timing</b> <b>difference</b> of 5 - 11 min. We did not detect an early ingress in our three nights of near-UV observations, despite an average cadence of 68 s and an average photometric precision of 3. 7 mmag. However, we determined an upper limit of TrES- 3 b's magnetic field strength to range between 0. 013 and 1. 3 G (for a 1 - 100 G magnetic field strength range for the host star, TrES- 3) using a <b>timing</b> <b>difference</b> of 138 s derived from the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. To verify our results of an abnormally small magnetic field strength for TrES- 3 b and to further constrain the techniques of Vidotto et al., we propose future observations of TrES- 3 b with other platforms capable of achieving a shorter near-UV cadence. We also present a refinement of the physical parameters of TrES- 3 b, an updated ephemeris and its first published near-UV light curve. We find that the near-UV planetary radius of Rp = 1. 386 + 0. 248 - 0. 144 RJup is consistent with the planet's optical radius.
