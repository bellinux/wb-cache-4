5|$|Jones {{served as}} Clerk of Court for Hampshire County for a tenure {{spanning}} 25 years {{until his retirement}} from the position in 1782. In their History of Hampshire County, West Virginia (1897), Maxwell and Swisher theorize <b>that</b> <b>Jones</b> retired from his position {{due in part to}} Lord Fairfax's death the previous year and waning British influence in Virginia toward the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War.|$|E

5|$|Opening {{arguments}} by both {{prosecution and}} defense set up cases based on purported times of death. Basing their assertion on pathologist-given testimony <b>that</b> <b>Jones</b> had died {{about six hours}} after she ate lunch on May 26, the prosecution claimed <b>that</b> <b>Jones</b> had died more than 24 hours before Kinne and Boldizs found her body; defense attorneys argued that death had more likely occurred six to eight hours prior. Prosecutor J. Arnott Hill cited testimony by Chief of Detectives Lieutenant Harry Nesbitt and by Patricia Jones's husband, Walter, as evidence of Kinne's motive for the crime: the detective recalled statements by Kinne that she was afraid Jones was drifting away from her despite the financial support she offered him, and Jones testified that Kinne had {{told him she was}} pregnant by him and he had thereafter attempted to end the relationship.|$|E
5|$|After Jones makes another {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt to}} open a doorway at a soccer field in Providence, Olivia searches through old case files related to science and unexplained phenomena, and discovers a geographic connection between the soccer field, the city street, and several of their past Fringe cases. Olivia and Walter {{come to the same}} conclusion, <b>that</b> <b>Jones</b> is going to use a site at Reiden Lake to reopen the doorway, the epicenter of these Fringe events. Olivia, Peter, and Walter intercept Jones while he is opening another window and is halfway through it. Peter triggers Walter's device, killing Jones by sealing the doorway.|$|E
5|$|Around 1760, Jones hired Samuel Dew of Richmond County {{to serve}} as his deputy clerk. Dew apprenticed under Jones for 21 years, {{occasionally}} performing duties as acting clerk. Due to his close relationship with Lord Fairfax, it is likely <b>that</b> <b>Jones</b> was Clerk of Court of neighboring counties also under the ownership of Lord Fairfax's Northern Neck Proprietary. According to Maxwell and Swisher, Jones relied upon his deputy clerks, such as Dew, to transcribe and document court proceedings, which Jones traveled among the various counties to sign.|$|E

50|$|On May 16, 2007, Jones filed a {{civil lawsuit}} against the United States of America, KBR and former parent {{corporation}} Halliburton, {{and one of its}} former employees (one of the firefighters who she alleged raped her). KBR asked the court to compel arbitration based on her employment contract. On September 15, 2009, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 decision, ruled <b>that</b> <b>Jones's</b> lawsuit could proceed in court.|$|R
5|$|However, Jones' {{figure of}} 600,000 {{is based on}} {{assumptions}} about limitanei unit strengths which may be too high. Jones calculated unit-strengths in Egypt under Diocletian using papyrus evidence of unit payrolls. But a rigorous reassessment of that evidence by R. Duncan-Jones concluded <b>that</b> <b>Jones</b> had overestimated unit sizes by 2–6 times. For example, Jones estimated legions on the frontiers at c. 3,000 men and other units at c. 500. But Duncan-Jones' revisions found frontier legions of around 500 men, an ala of just 160 and an equites unit of 80. Even allowing {{for the possibility that}} some of these units were detachments from larger units, it is likely that Diocletianic unit-strengths were far lower than earlier.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the gradual}} estrangement of Brian Jones and his {{decreasing}} musical contributions – {{he had only}} appeared on two tracks on the then in-progress Let It Bleed — made a return to touring problematic. They had shelved The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus after having been upstaged by The Who. By June 1969, matters had finally come to a head and it was decided <b>that</b> <b>Jones</b> should be replaced for the gig.|$|E
5|$|In May 1942, the Australian {{government}} appointed Air Vice Marshal George Jones as Chief of the Air Staff.

50|$|KBR later filed {{a motion}} to recover more than $2 million in {{attorney}} fees and court costs. In the motion KBR states <b>that</b> <b>Jones's</b> hostile work environment and rape claims were fabricated and frivolous. In a subsequent ruling, the court held Jones liable for KBR's court costs of $145,000, but also determined that the case was not frivolous and therefore she was not liable for KBR's attorney fees.|$|R

5|$|After {{six games}} without a goal and some {{criticism}} from supporters, manager Pulis revealed <b>that</b> <b>Jones</b> has had personal problems which have affected his performances. He ended this {{run with a}} goal against Everton on New Year's Day. However, he again went on a goal drought this time for three months before scoring against Tottenham Hotspur in April. He then went on a similar scoring run he had {{at the start of}} the season scoring against Bolton Wanderers at Wembley, Aston Villa, Wolverhampton Wanderers and then had an opportunity to become the first Stoke player to score in four consecutive Premier League matches against Blackpool but he missed an open goal. He made amends the following match scoring against Arsenal in a 3–1 win. Jones played in the 2011 FA Cup Final as Stoke lost 1–0 to Manchester City, he had Stoke's best chance in the match going through one on one with Joe Hart who saved Jones' effort. Jones ended the 2010–11 as joint top goalscorer with Jonathan Walters, both scored 12 goals. Jones said that he had a 'topsy-turvy' first season at Stoke.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{introduction}} of the Bagnall locomotives and the traffic generated by the works at Waddesdon Manor had boosted the route's fortunes, it remained in serious financial difficulty. The only connection with the national railway network was by way of the turntable at Quainton Road. The 3rd Duke of Buckingham chaired the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway but its management regarded the Tramway as a nuisance. In the 1870s it charged disproportionately high fees for through traffic between the Tramway and the main line with the intention of forcing the Tramway out of business. Relations deteriorated between Jones and J.G. Rowe, Secretary and Traffic Manager of the A The A's trains at Quainton Road would miss connections with the Tramway, causing milk shipped to Quainton to become unsellable, to the extent <b>that</b> <b>Jones</b> began unloading milk at Waddesdon and shipping it to Aylesbury by road. Although Jones asked the Duke to intervene relations remained poor; in 1888 Rowe blocked the telegraph along the Tramway, and in one meeting Jones and Rowe threatened violence.|$|E
5|$|As {{he entered}} his {{freshman}} season at Duke, {{he was expected}} to battle with senior point guard Quinn Cook and junior guard Rasheed Sulaimon for playing time following the graduation of Tyler Thornton. Well before the season there were expectations <b>that</b> <b>Jones</b> would win the starting point guard position. Thus, he was selected by USA Today to its Preseason All-American second team and by CBS Sports to its Preseason All-American third team. In its preseason top 100 player ranking, Jones was listed at number 45 by ESPN. Jones was named to the 36-man Bob Cousy Award Preseason Watch List. He was also listed as a John R. Wooden Award Preseason Top 50 candidate and a Wayman Tisdale Award Watch List selection. Jones was also included in the early December Naismith Award top 50 watch list.|$|E
50|$|On August 15, 2006, Bean {{apparently}} {{tied the}} Clippers' team record for career games pitched, {{when he made}} his 212th career appearance for Columbus as the starter in a 2-1 win. The previous record had been credited to Bumpus Jones, a 19th-century player. However, modern research indicates <b>that</b> <b>Jones's</b> actual games pitched total may have been closer to 150, in which case Bean would have already held the record for some time. The next-highest total behind Bean and Jones is George McQuillan, currently credited with 204.|$|R
2500|$|Christopher Jones is {{described}} in a document of January 1611 as being [...] "of Harwich", and his ship is called the Mayflower of Harwich (in the county of Essex). Records of Jones's ship Mayflower show that the ship was twice on the Thames at London in 1613, once in July and again in October and November. Records of 1616 again state <b>that</b> <b>Jones's</b> ship was on the Thames, carrying a cargo of wine, {{which suggests that the}} ship had recently been on a voyage to France, Spain, Portugal, the Canaries, or some other wine-producing land.|$|R

5|$|Christine Collins {{was placed}} in Los Angeles County Hospital by Captain Jones. After her release, she sued the police {{department}} twice, winning the second lawsuit. Although Captain Jones was ordered to pay Collins $10,800, he never did. A city council welfare hearing recommended <b>that</b> <b>Jones</b> and Chief of Police James E. Davis leave their posts, but both were later reinstated. The California State Legislature later made it illegal {{for the police to}} commit someone to a psychiatric facility without a warrant. Northcott was convicted of the murders of Lewis Winslow (12), Nelson Winslow (10) and an unidentified Mexican boy; after his conviction, Northcott was reported to have admitted to up to 20 murders, though he later denied the claim. Northcott was executed by hanging in 1930 at the age of 23. Sarah Louise was convicted of Walter Collins' murder and served almost 12 years in prison. In 1930, the residents of Wineville changed the town's name to Mira Loma to escape the notoriety brought by the case.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Kinne was {{associated}} with two mysterious deaths. On March 19 of that year, her husband, James Kinne, was found {{shot in the head}} with the couple's two-year-old daughter playing nearby. Sharon Kinne claimed that the little girl, who had often been allowed to play with her father's guns, had accidentally shot him, and police were initially unable to disprove this theory. The case was closed as an accidental death and remained that way until the evening of May 27, when the body of twenty-three-year-old Patricia Jones, a local file clerk, was found by Kinne and a boyfriend in a secluded area. Investigation showed <b>that</b> <b>Jones</b> had been the wife of another of Kinne's boyfriends, and that Jones's husband had tried to break off his affair with Kinne shortly before Patricia Jones went missing. When Kinne admitted to having been the last person to speak to Patricia Jones, she was charged with Jones's death and, upon further investigation of his death, with the murder of James Kinne.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Jamaican {{broadsheet}} The Gleaner, Carolyn Cooper, Professor of Literary and Cultural Studies at UWI, {{condemned the}} group who committed Jones' murder. She blamed their behaviour on the selective {{use of the}} Bible, noting that while many Jamaicans embrace those Biblical passages which condemn same-sex sexual activity and cross-dressing, they are themselves typically guilty of many other Biblical sins, such as adultery and murder. She commented <b>that</b> <b>Jones</b> had been killed just for being himself and expressed the hope that his killers face legal prosecution for their crime. The following week she published a follow-up article in which she responded to several emails that she had received which claimed that the real victims of the scenario were the men whom Jones deceived when he was dancing with them. She reiterated her condemnation of Jones' killers, remarking that rather than retaliating violently, they should have brushed {{it off with a}} humorous comment.|$|E
5000|$|As was his policy, Graham ignored {{criticism}} of his campaigns and, in 1966, claimed not {{to know why the}} University opposed them; but members of his staff openly accused Jones of jealousy on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>Jones’s</b> evangelistic meetings had never been as large as Graham’s. Graham’s father-in-law, L. Nelson Bell, mailed a fiery ten-page letter to most members of the BJU faculty and student body (as well as to thousands of pastors across the country) accusing Jones of “hatred, distortions, jealousies, envying, malice, false witnessing, and untruthfulness.” ...|$|R
