25|$|On current Ducati motors, {{except for}} the Desmosedici and 1199 Panigale, the valves are {{actuated}} by a standard valve cam shaft which is rotated by a <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> driven by the motor directly. The teeth on the belt keep the camshaft drive pulleys indexed. On older Ducati motors, prior to 1986, drive was by solid shaft that transferred to the camshaft through bevel-cut gears. This method of valve actuation was used on many of Ducati's older single-cylinder motorcycles — the shaft tube is visible {{on the outside of}} the cylinder.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The paper {{presents}} the {{solution for the}} feed mechanisms of the rotary-tilting table with a 250 mm diameter that {{is used in the}} 5 -axis machining centers. Rotary-tilting table are equipped with synchronous worm gears duplex, <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> get moving through the actuator drive. Gear ratios of duplex worm gears are 1 : 40, and <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> transmission gear ratios is 1 : 1. For tension <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> are use the excentric tensioners. Tilting movement servomotor is located on the motherboard of the rotary-tilting table and feed rotary servomotor is located in the tilting axis. The result is a table with small footprint, low cost, without diminishing performance...|$|R
50|$|On 22 June 2007, Pearson, Simon, Soter, Warshaw & Penny, LLP and the Law Office of Robert L. Starr filed a {{class action}} lawsuit against Volkswagen Group of America, alleging that the <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> for model year 1999-2003 Audi and Volkswagen {{vehicles}} equipped with a 1.8-litre turbocharged engine fail prematurely. The vehicles included are the Audi TT, Audi A4 and Volkswagen Passat. The complaint alleged that the <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> failed prior to the service interval, {{as stated in the}} owner's manual. The parties have reached a class-wide settlement, and preliminary approval of the settlement was granted by the court on 19 May 2008.|$|R

25|$|Land Rover's radically updated {{product line}} was {{launched}} in 1983. Initially only the long-wheelbase One Ten was available and it was sold with the same engine line-up as the preceding Series III model- 2.25-litre petrol and diesel engines and the 3.5-litre Rover V8. However, Land Rover planned a series of rolling improvements. Launched shortly before the short-wheelbase Ninety model in 1984 was a 2.5-litre diesel engine. This {{was little more than}} an updated version of the existing diesel unit (at this time 22 years old). The stroke was lengthened to improve torque, and an updated cylinder head was used to reduce noise and emissions. A more modern injector pump improved fuel economy and an improved glow plug system improved cold-starting performance. The most significant change was the swapping of the chain-driven camshaft for one driven by a fibre toothed belt, which also drove the repositioned injector pump. The drive vacated by the injector pump was used to power a vacuum pump for the brake servo system. To reduce engine weight, extensive use of aluminium castings was made for the cambelt case, vacuum pump, rocker cover and other parts. Other small improvements were made such as the fitment of a spin-on cartridge oil filter instead of older, harder-to-change element type and the fitting of under-piston oil jets. In the mid-1980s Land Rover was part of the Land Rover Group, responsible for production of the Freight Rover van. The 2.5-litre diesel was fitted to the Freight Rover 300-series and the FX4 taxi (the engines for these applications had slight design changes, such as higher-mounted injector pumps and non-waterproof cambelt cases. They received the designations 14J and 15J respectively. Being fitted with a <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> rather than a chain the 15J engine suffered none of the reliability problems in the FX4 that its 10J predecessor had encountered (see above)). The engine became a special-order only option after the introduction of turbodiesel engines (see below) but remained in production (and popular with military and some commercial buyers) until 1994. The British Army used this engine {{in the vast majority of}} the 20,000 Land Rovers it bought between 1985 and 1994. A manufacturing flaw with pistons combined with Army maintenance practises (such as a tendency to over-fill the sump with oil) caused the engines to over-breathe and ingest their oil, leading to piston failure. Late military-spec engines had a centrifugal separator in the breather system, allowing excess oil to drain back to the sump. These engines were designated 13J. and 11J (ref Land Rover Defender Military 110 1991 Supplementary Parts Catalogue). These later, modified engines were the first in their class (small capacity high-speed diesels) to pass the Ministry of Defence's arduous 500-hour durability trial.|$|E
25|$|In 1989 Land Rover had {{launched}} the Discovery its Range Rover-based family 4×4 that quickly became Europe's top-selling 4×4. One {{of the key}} reasons for its success was its ground-breaking turbodiesel engine. The 200Tdi {{was one of the}} first mass-produced small-capacity (i.e., not a lorry engine) direct-injection diesels, with the attendant improvements in power and efficiency that system brings. Developed under the codename Gemini, the 200Tdi was planned from the start to be used on all Land Rover's products. For production reasons, it had to be machined on the existing machinery, so used the same block and crankshaft as the existing 2.5-litre diesel engines. It also used many ancillary parts used on the older engines. However, it was a true break with the past. An aluminium alloy cylinder head reduced weight and noise, a new Bosch injection system gave improved running characteristics and better starting performance. An intercooler boosted power and efficiency further. Lessons learnt from the Diesel Turbo were included, such as the fitment of an inertial separator in the breather system to remove oil before crankcase gases were returned to the air intake. Initially turbocharged and naturally aspirated diesel versions and a carburettor-fed petrol version were to be produced. The direct-injection system meant that only machining of the injector sockets was needed to allow the fitment of spark plugs. However, the performance and economy of the turbodiesel version was such that the other variants were not produced. The 200Tdi was launched in the Discovery in 1989. It was then fitted to the utility Land Rover (renamed the Defender) in late 1990. For this application the engine was slightly de-tuned and, whilst in the Discovery the 200Tdi used all-new components, packaging restraints in the Defender meant that the 200Tdi in this role shared many exterior parts (such as the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> system and case) with the Diesel Turbo. Most obviously the turbocharger was retained in the Diesel Turbo's high mounting position on top of the manifolds in the Defender, rather than being tucked under the manifolds in the original Discovery version. In 1992 the engine was fitted to the Range Rover. Although the older petrol and naturally aspirated diesel units were theoretically still available, the 200Tdi had better performance and economy than any of them, and so dominated the sales figures. It is still highly regarded by Land Rover enthusiasts and has established itself as a powerful and long-lived unit that with proper maintenance can exceed 300,000 miles of use. The engine's commonality with the older models makes it a popular choice for installation in older Land Rovers. This is done both in original form or with the turbo removed (when the engine becomes known to enthusiasts as a 200Di) in order to keep the power/torque output within the limits of a Series Land Rover's gearbox and for greater ease of conversion. The turbocharged version may also be installed with or without the intercooler.|$|E
2500|$|Powertrain {{detail of}} the Audi V8 {{featured}} one of two all-new, all-aluminium alloy engines – both petrol engines, and both in V8 configuration with 32 valves (four valves per cylinder) with dual valve springs, and four overhead camshafts (DOHC). The design set the pattern for future Audi-developed Volkswagen Group V8 engines. In addition to using an all-aluminum alloy cylinder block (when the established material was grey cast iron), the camshafts were driven using a hybrid method. A rubber/kevlar toothed <b>timing</b> <b>belt,</b> driven {{from the front of}} the crankshaft operated only the exhaust camshaft in each bank. [...] The inlet camshafts were then operated via a simplex roller chain from the exhaust camshaft – the right bank, (cylinders 1–4) at the rear of the engine, and the left bank (cylinders 5–8) at the front of the engine, immediately behind the <b>timing</b> <b>belt.</b> This method reduced the complexity of the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> layout, and as a result, required fewer components, such as idler rollers and guides, and lead to easier and less costly maintenance of the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> and associated components. [...] The intervals for changing the timing belts varied; the 3.6V8 (PT) required changing every , whereas the 4.2V8 (ABH) had a longer interval at [...] A thermostatically controlled electric cooling fan also became standard, replacing the engine-driven viscous fans on earlier cars. [...] This not only provided forced airflow for the engine coolant radiator, but also for the smaller engine oil cooler.|$|E
50|$|Other engine {{features}} were desmodromic valves, <b>timing</b> <b>belts,</b> two valves per cylinder (Taglioni {{did not love}} multi-valve), two-segment pistons (to reduce friction), a bearing type single-piece crankshaft with coupled connecting rods and four 40mm Dell'Orto carburettors installed on long inlet manifolds between the cylinder banks.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{rear suspension}} consisted of independent, unequal-length wishbones, coil springs, twin telescopic shock absorbers on each side, and an anti-roll bar.

2500|$|One {{critical}} maintenance issue {{specific to}} the Yugo 55 and 65 (the 45 was a 903 cc pushrod engine, with a timing chain) was the need for regular replacement of the interference engine's timing belt— every [...] In a non-interference engine, <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> failure does not cause further damage to the engine. However, in an interference engine, failure of the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> disrupts the synchronization between pistons and poppet valves, causing them to collide with one another (hence the name interference engine), thus potentially destroying the engine. Though this requirement was stressed in owners' manuals, it was frequently overlooked by owners. The factory also {{stressed the need for}} 89-octane fuels for the low-compression engines.|$|E
2500|$|The 2.5-litre {{version of}} the diesel engine, {{displacing}} [...] and producing , was introduced in both the 110 and the newly arrived 90. This was a long-stroke {{version of the}} venerable 2.25-litre unit, fitted with updated fuel injection equipment and a revised cylinder head for quieter, smoother and more efficient running. A <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> also replaced the older engine's chain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between {{the rotation of the}} camshaft and the rotation of the crankshaft is of critical importance. Since the valves control the flow of the air/fuel mixture intake and exhaust gases, they must be opened and closed at the appropriate time during the stroke of the piston. For this reason, the camshaft is connected to the crankshaft either directly, via a gear mechanism, or indirectly via a belt or chain called a <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> or timing chain. [...] Direct drive using gears is unusual because of the cost. The frequently reversing torque caused by the slope of the cams tends to cause gear rattle which for an all-metal gear train requires further expense of a cam damper. Rolls-Royce V8 (1954) used gear drive as, unlike chain, it could be made silent and to last the life of the engine. Where gears are used in cheaper cars, they tend to be made from resilient fibre rather than metal, except in racing engines that have a high maintenance routine. Fibre gears have a short life span and must be replaced regularly, much like a <b>timing</b> <b>belt.</b> In some designs the camshaft also drives the distributor and the oil and fuel pumps. [...] Some vehicles may have the power steering pump driven by the camshaft. [...] With some early fuel injection systems, cams on the camshaft would operate the fuel injectors. Honda redesigned the VF750 motorcycle from chain drive to the gear drive VFR750 due to insurmountable problems with the VF750 Hi-Vo inverted chain drive.|$|E

50|$|The SOHC EJ Subaru boxer engines were non-interference engines through 1995, run by {{a single}} <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> driving both cams (both sides of the engine) and the water pump.

5000|$|Timing belts are {{typically}} covered by metal or polymer <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> covers which require removal for inspection or replacement.

50|$|A <b>timing</b> <b>belt,</b> {{timing chain}} or cambelt {{is a part}} of an {{internal}} combustion engine that synchronizes the rotation of the crankshaft and the camshaft(s) so that the engine's valves open and close at the proper times during each cylinder's intake and exhaust strokes. In an interference engine the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> or chain is also critical to preventing the piston from striking the valves. A <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> is usually a toothed belt -- a drive belt with teeth on the inside surface. A timing chain is a roller chain.|$|E
50|$|In the {{internal}} combustion engine application the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> or chain connects the crankshaft to the camshaft(s), which in turn control the opening and closing of the engine's valves. A four-stroke engine requires that the valves open and close once every other revolution of the crankshaft. The <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> does this. It has teeth to turn the camshaft(s) synchronised with the crankshaft, and is specifically designed for a particular engine. In some engine designs the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> may also be used to drive other engine components such as the water pump and oil pump.|$|E
