25|$|Stiglitz wrote {{a series}} of papers and held {{a series of}} {{conferences}} explaining how such information uncertainties may have influence on everything from unemployment to lending shortages. As the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the first term of the Clinton Administration and former chief economist at the World Bank, Stiglitz was able <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his views into action. For example, he was an outspoken critic of quickly opening up financial markets in developing countries. These markets rely on access to good financial data and sound bankruptcy laws, but he argued that many of these countries didn't have the regulatory institutions needed to ensure that the markets would operate soundly.|$|E
25|$|Jones was {{employed}} {{as one of}} the Superintendents of Works for the Great Exhibition of 1851. He was responsible for not only the decoration of Joseph Paxton's gigantic cast iron and glass palace, but also for the arrangement of the exhibits within, and this was the architectural project which first brought Jones to the wider public's attention. Based on his observations of primary colour polychromy within the architecture of Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and at the Alhambra, he chose a simple palette of red, yellow and blue for the interior ironwork. Colour theories were relatively new, and his controversial paint scheme created much debate and negative publicity in the newspapers and journals of the day. Crucially, after early viewings, Prince Albert maintained his support, and Jones ploughed on regardless. The public and professional criticism gradually dissipated until the building was eventually unveiled by Queen Victoria to much critical acclaim – some commenting that Jones's colouring was similar in effect to the paintings of Turner. Jones had been offered a rare chance <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his theories on polychromy into practice on a grand scale: six million people witnessed his vision at the Great Exhibition during its short existence – roughly three times the population of London at that time.|$|E

Also, like Dunne, she was laid off after many years at the same job. Flynn said, [...] "I certainly wove that experience, that sense of having something {{that you were going to}} do for the rest of your life and seeing that possibility taken away... I definitely wove that sense of unrest and nervousness into Nick's character." ...|$|R

500|$|The Narragansett Pacer was not {{exclusively}} a pacing horse, as strong evidence indicates it exhibited an ambling gait, {{which is a}} four-beat, intermediate-speed gait, while the pace is a two-beat, intermediate-speed gait. The amble is more comfortable to ride than the pace, and Narragansett Pacers were known for their qualities as both riding and driving horses. They averaged around [...] tall, and were generally chestnut in color. James Fenimore Cooper described them as: [...] "They have handsome foreheads, the head clean, the neck long, the arms and legs thin and tapered."; however, another source stated, [...] "The hindquarters are narrow and the hocks a little crooked...", but also said, [...] "They are very spirited and carry both the head and tail high. But what is more remarkable is that they amble with more speed than most horses trot, {{so that it is}} difficult <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them upon a gallop." [...] Other viewers of the breed rarely called them stylish or good-looking, although they considered them dependable, easy to work with and sure-footed.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, John Lasseter {{spoke about}} how they worked {{hard to make the}} {{animation}} believable, saying: [...] "It took many months of trial and error, and practicing test animation, to figure out how each car moves and how their world works. Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator to be able <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, {{it was so much fun}} because we would see things that we had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s, Green {{has tried}} <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his more {{controversial}} material {{behind him and}} become a more mainstream entertainer. Green was a recurring contributor to The Tonight Show with Jay Leno; doing many segments where he travels across America looking for [...] "interesting people", typically bringing the most colourful person with {{him back to the}} studio. In these segments, the focus is more on the odd behavior of the interviewees, with Green generally playing the straight man.|$|E

2500|$|The Gemara {{taught that}} God's {{instruction}} to Moses in [...] <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his honor on Joshua {{was not to}} transfer all of the honor of Moses. The elders of that generation compared the countenance of Moses {{to that of the}} sun and the countenance of Joshua to that of the moon. The elders considered it a shame and a reproach that there had been such a decline in the stature of Israel's leadership in the course of just one generation.|$|E
2500|$|Like Walter Scott and Landor, Southey {{connects the}} events {{surrounding}} Napoleon with the Moors' invasion of Spain within his work. In a letter to Landor, Southey described the rape scene: [...] "here you have {{a part of the}} poem so difficult to get over even tolerably that I verily believe if I had at first thought of making Roderick any thing more than a sincere penitent this difficulty would have deterred me from attempting the subject." [...] To overcome the problem with having his main character rape a woman, Southey decided <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the responsibility on Florinda and make Roderick more sympathetic. It is also possible that there are autobiographical elements to the scene, especially with Roderick's problematic marriage to a woman he did not love as possibly describing the events of his friend Samuel Taylor Coleridge's life and his love for Sara Hutchinson. This would allow Southey to deal with events from his life in a poetic form.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, {{two couples}} {{have entered the}} forest: Lovers Hermia and Lysander are pursued by Demetrius, who also loves Hermia, and Helena, who loves Demetrius. Oberon {{witnesses}} Demetrius rejecting Helena, admires her amorous determination, and decides to help her. He sends Puck <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the juice in Demetrius's eyes, describing him as “a youth in Athenian clothing”, to make him {{fall in love with}} Helena. Puck finds Lysander [...] who is also a youth wearing Athenian clothing [...] and puts the love potion on Lysander's eyes. When Lysander wakes, he sees Helena first and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Demetrius has also been anointed with the flower and awakes to see Helena, pursued by Lysander, and a fight breaks out between the two young men. Oberon is furious with Puck, and casts a sleeping spell on the forest, making Puck reverse the potion on Lysander, admonishing Puck to not reverse the effects on Demetrius. Both couples awake and begin the journey back to Athens.|$|E

60|$|Their {{first step}} was to {{strengthen}} the naval force on the American coast and by additional vigilance <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> sort <b>of</b> check on the wholesale smuggling which prevailed. This step caused extreme discontent among the trading classes of America, and these set to work vigorously to stir up a strong feeling of disaffection against England.

60|$|Captain Giles and I got up {{from the}} table, and the {{stranger}} next to Hamilton followed our example, manoeuvring himself to his feet with difficulty.

But with the pressure of his purpose driving him forward, he did not conceal from Miss Woodburn, at least, that he was eager to get her apart from the rest for some reason.

For the second time, he entreated me to defer the discussion of that unpleasant subject for the present--and yet, with a curious inconsistency, he made another inquiry relating to the subject in the same breath.|$|E
40|$|Théodore Géricault’s Monomanes (Portraits of the Insane ; 1820 s) were rediscovered in 1863, {{just four}} years before his first {{biography}} was published.
