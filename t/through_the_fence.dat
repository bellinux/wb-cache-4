5|$|After regrouping, Carter, Susan and Preacher go to a {{decompression}} {{chamber and}} swim to the surface. Carter {{realizes that the}} sharks made them flood the facility so they could escape through the weaker mesh fences at the surface. In an effort to distract the last shark from escaping to the open sea, Susan cuts herself and dives into the water. Although she manages to distract the shark, she is unable {{to get out of}} the water. Carter dives in, but is too late to save her from being devoured. While Carter is grabbing hold of the shark's dorsal fin, Preacher shoots the shark with a harpoon, but the spear also goes through Carter's thigh. As the shark breaks <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> Carter orders Preacher to connect the trailing wire to a battery, sending an electric current through the wire and to an explosive charge in the harpoon, killing the shark. In the end, Carter managed to free himself in time, and joins Preacher to see a workers' boat en-route on the horizon.|$|E

25|$|On November 18, 1936, Luther Blanton and his son, John, trespassed on {{the ranch}} by {{crawling}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> surrounding it. They had intended to hunt ducks and nearby residents reported hearing shots fired. Shortly thereafter, locals organized a group to force their way onto the ranch around the area where they were known to have gone hunting. However, neither Blanton nor his son were ever seen again. A subsequent police investigation resulted in no arrests. Although most residents suspected them being murdered by ranch guards for trespassing, it remains a long-standing unsolved mystery.|$|E
25|$|In December 2008, a {{slowdown}} in passenger traffic led the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority to curtail spending plans, including deferring multimillion-dollar construction projects. The weak economy continued to affect the airport in 2010, with figures showing a 6% decline in passengers {{for the fiscal year}} ending June 30. The slowdown is one reason the airport authority scrapped plans to spend $4 million to erect barriers at the west end of the runway. In 2000, a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 flight with 142 persons aboard overshot the runway and went <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> coming to a stop on Hollywood Way near a Chevron gas station.|$|E
25|$|By 1908, a {{new record}} {{attendance}} of 50,261 was set, {{on a day when}} the crowd was so huge that it broke <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> and filed onto the ground, sitting around the boundary line to watch the action. This figure was beaten in the 1912 Grand Final when 54,463 saw Essendon defeat South Melbourne. The big finals crowds (and increasing cricket attendances) prompted the MCC to cut down the eleven fifty-year-old elm trees inside the ground and turn the stadium into a concrete bowl, complete with extra stands and standing room. The record fell again in the last grand final before World War I, when the excitement of St Kilda's first premiership attempt drew 59,479 spectators.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. {{rushed to}} {{liberate}} the prisoner of war and internee camps in the Philippines due to a common belief that the Japanese would massacre all their prisoners, military and civilian. A small American force pushed rapidly forward and, on February 3, 1945 at 8:40p.m., internees {{heard the sound of}} tanks, grenades, and rifle fire near the front wall of Santo Tomas. Five American tanks broke <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> of the compound. The Japanese soldiers took refuge in the large, three-story Education Building, taking 200 internees hostage, including internee leader Earl Carroll, and interpreter Ernest Stanley. Carroll and Stanley were ordered to accompany several Japanese soldiers to a meeting with American forces to negotiate a safe passage for the Japanese out of Santo Tomas in exchange for a release of their 200 hostages. During the meeting between the Americans and Japanese, a Japanese officer named Abiko reached into a pouch on his back, apparently for a hand grenade, and an American soldier shot and wounded him. Abiko was especially hated by the internees. He was carried away by a mob of enraged internees, kicked and slashed with knives, and thrown out of a hospital bed onto the floor. He died a few hours later.|$|E
500|$|References to Shaun of the Dead {{are also}} present in the film. In one scene, Nicholas wants to chase a {{shoplifter}} by jumping over garden fences; however, Danny is reluctant. Nicholas says, [...] "What's the matter, Danny? You never taken a shortcut before?" [...] He smiles assuredly before jumping over {{three in a row}} (according to the DVD commentary, Pegg vaulted over three fences, and a stunt man did a back flip over the fourth). When Danny attempts it, he trips and falls <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> This is almost identical to a scene in Shaun of the Dead, including the fall-through-fence gag, albeit with the pratfalling role reverse: in Shaun of the Dead it happens to Pegg's character rather than Frost's, and he falls over the fence rather than through it. The DVD commentary says that Frost purposely looked back at the camera after crashing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> to show that he had done the stunt rather than someone else.|$|E
500|$|Other {{reviews of}} the book's {{illustrations}} were positive. Beier writes highly of the illustrations and states that Dyer's paintings of the dogs' faces are priceless, particularly in the scenes where {{they are looking at}} each other <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> and those where they are in their owners' arms. Similarly, the Kirkus reviewer calls the illustrations charming and writes that they [...] "have all the clever details that are Dyer's signature touch", noting specifically the lavender frames of Miss Violet's eyeglasses and the inclusion of the dogs' names on their collars. Fletcher suggests that, apart from the [...] "ominous grays and greens" [...] in the illustrations of the forest scenes with the bear, the pastel-colored illustrations in the book are evocative of 1940s picture postcards, which she considers [...] "just right for such jolly capers".|$|E

500|$|Lange {{had several}} notable moments during the [...] season. [...] On July 4, he stole five bases {{in one game}} against the Louisville Colonels, {{although}} it was two stolen bases short of the record of seven set by George Gore and Billy Hamilton. [...] During a game on August 31, he entered baseball lore with a feat that he never actually performed. [...] The game was scoreless {{in the bottom of}} the 10th inning when Lange made a diving catch in center field to keep the game scoreless. [...] Later in the inning, Chicago's first baseman, George Decker attempted to field a thrown ball from third baseman Barry McCormick, but it bounced off and broke his wrist instead. [...] In an effort to get Decker to the hospital adjacent the ballpark, his teammates knocked down several wooden slats of the outfield fence to expedite his journey. [...] However, the two events were confused and it became legend that Lange had crashed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> making that acrobatic catch in tenth. [...] Lange finished the season with a [...]326batting average, while also stealing 84bases, second in the league, and finished eighth in league with 16triples.|$|E
500|$|Relations {{between the}} Olympians and the Australian Government {{remained}} tense {{after months of}} political struggle regarding the boycott. A prime minister would customarily send a congratulatory message to Olympic medallists. However, the Australian Olympic chef de mission Phil Coles confirmed at the following day's press conference that the quartet had not received a message from Malcolm Fraser. Australian journalists soon bombarded Fraser's office with phone calls asking why he had not applauded the athletes. Various members of the government recommended that Fraser congratulate the swimmers, but the prime minister baulked. When questioned in a radio interview, he said [...] "I hope that circumstances do not arise {{over the next few}} years which will cause them to have very great regrets about the fact that they've gone". Fraser relented and late in the night, his office sent a telegram. However, he would not send his message directly to the Olympic village, so the telegram was sent to the Australian Embassy in Moscow. Fraser had ordered the Australian diplomatic mission to close its doors to the Olympians, so the embassy staff had to pass the envelopes containing the message <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> to Australian Olympic officials. Fraser's telegram said: ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 13, 1808, {{there was}} a {{ceremony}} to lay the cornerstone of a planned vault. A grand ceremony of re-interment followed on May 26, 1808. A small square building stood above the 1808 vault with an eagle mounted {{at the point of}} the roof. [...] It was located on a triangular plot of land near the Brooklyn Navy Yard waterfront (Wallabout Bay) in what is now called Vinegar Hill. A wooden fence with thirteen posts and bars painted with the names of the original thirteen states was erected in front. At the entrance <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> an inscription said: [...] "Portal to the tomb of 11,500 patriot prisoners, who died in dungeons and prison-ships, in and about the City of New York, during the Revolution." [...] The remains were put in long coffins made of bluestone. Extra space was provided in case more bones were discovered during continuing renovations in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Little was done to repair or upkeep the vault and eventually, the original monument {{was in a state of}} disrepair and neglect. In 1839, Benjamin Romaine purchased the land where the Martyrs were buried, in a tax sale from Henry Reed Stiles for $291.08. Later that year on July 4, 1839, Benjamin Romaine made an appeal for support (governmental or civic) to build a monument. In this appeal, Romaine talked about the monument and his intention to use his Revolutionary War pension for the monument. On January 31, 1844, Benjamin Romaine died and was also interred in the crypt as he had been a prisoner of war on the ships.|$|E
2500|$|The IRA unit {{arrived in}} Loughgall from the {{northeast}} shortly after 7PM. All were armed and wearing bulletproof vests, boilersuits, gloves and balaclavas. The digger drove past the police station, turned and drove back again with the Toyota van doing the same, ostensibly to check if the coast was clear. Members of the unit felt that something was amiss, and debated whether to continue, but {{decided to go ahead}} with the attack. Tony Gormley and Gerard O'Callaghan got out of the van and joined Declan Arthurs on the digger, according to journalist Peter Taylor, [...] "literally riding shotgun", with weapons in one hand and a lighter in the other. At about 7:15, Declan Arthurs drove the digger towards the base. In the front bucket was 200–400 lb of semtex inside an oil drum, partially hidden by rubble and wired to two 40-second fuses. The other five members of the unit followed in the van with Eugene Kelly driving, unit commander Patrick Kelly in the passenger seat whilst in the rear were Jim Lynagh, Pádraig McKearney, and Seamus Donnelly. [...] The digger crashed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> and the fuses were lit. The van stopped a short distance ahead and—according to the British security forces—three of the team jumped out and fired on the building. Author Raymond Murray, however, disputes this. [...] According to Taylor, Patrick Kelly jumped from the passenger seat and, followed by others, immediately opened fire on the base either to encourage the rest of the unit, to resolve dispute about going ahead with the operation, or possibly because this was the way previous attacks had begun. At the same time, the bomb detonated, destroying the digger along with much of the building, and injuring three members of the security forces.|$|E
2500|$|Ian Botham {{was born}} on 24 November 1955 in Heswall, on the Wirral, to Herbert Leslie ("Les") Botham and Violet Marie, [...] Collett. Ian's father {{had been in the}} Fleet Air Arm for twenty years {{spanning}} the Second World War; his mother was a nurse. The family moved to Yeovil before Ian's third birthday after his father got a job as a test engineer at Westland Helicopters. Both his parents played cricket: his father for Westland Sports Club while his mother captained a nursing services team at Sherborne. Ian developed an eagerness for the game before he had started school: he would climb <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> of the Yeovil Boys' Grammar School to watch the pupils play cricket. At the age of around four, he came home with a cricket ball and asked his mother [...] "Do you know how to hold a ball when you're going to bowl a daisy-cutter?" [...] He subsequently demonstrated the grip and went away to practise bowling it. He attended Milford Junior School in the town and it was there that his [...] "love affair" [...] with sport began. He played both cricket and football for the school's teams at the age of nine; two years earlier than most of his contemporaries. Playing against the older boys forced Botham to learn to hit the ball hard, and improve to their standard. At the same age he went to matches with his father, who played for Westland Sports Club, and if one of the teams was short, he would try to get a match. His father recalled that though he never got to bowl, and rarely got to bat, he received praise for the standard of his fielding. He joined the Boys' Brigade where more sporting opportunities were available. By the time he was nine, he had begun to [...] "haunt" [...] local recreation grounds with his kit always ready, looking to play for any team that was short of players. By the age of twelve he was playing occasional matches for Yeovil Cricket Club's second team.|$|E
