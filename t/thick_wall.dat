5|$|The city's fortifications were strong, {{with a wide}} moat and a <b>thick</b> <b>wall</b> {{protected}} by 44 towers, according to the contemporary geographer Ibn Khordadbeh. The caliph assigned each of his generals to a stretch of the walls. Both besiegers and besieged had many siege engines, and for three days both sides exchanged missile fire while Arab sappers tried to undermine the walls. According to Arab accounts, an Arab prisoner who had converted to Christianity defected back to the caliph, and informed him about {{a place in the}} wall which had been badly damaged by heavy rainfall and only hastily and superficially repaired due to the city commander's negligence. As a result, the Arabs concentrated their efforts on this section. The defenders tried to protect the wall by hanging wooden beams to absorb the shock of the siege engines, but they splintered, and after two days a breach was made. Immediately Aetios realized that the defence was compromised, and decided to try and break through the besieging army during the night and link up with Theophilos. He sent two messengers to the emperor, but both were captured by the Arabs and brought before the caliph. Both agreed to convert to Islam, and Mu'tasim, after giving them a rich reward, paraded them around the city walls in full view of Aetios and his troops. To prevent any sortie, the Arabs stepped up their vigilance, maintaining constant cavalry patrols even during the night.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} the {{building}} of Constantine's churches in Palestine there were two chief types of plan in use: the basilican, or axial, type, represented by the basilica at the Holy Sepulchre, and the circular, or central, type, represented by the great octagonal church once at Antioch. Those of the latter type we must suppose were nearly always vaulted, for a central dome would seem to furnish their very raison d'etre. The central space was sometimes surrounded by a very <b>thick</b> <b>wall,</b> in which deep recesses, to the interior, were formed, as at the noble Church of Saint George, Thessaloniki (5th century), or by a vaulted aisle, as at Santa Costanza, Rome (4th century); or annexes were thrown out from the central space {{in such a way}} as to form a cross, in which these additions helped to counterpoise the central vault, as at the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, Ravenna (5th century). The most famous church of this type was that of the Holy Apostles, Constantinople. Vaults appear to have been early applied to the basilican type of plan; for instance, at Hagia Irene, Constantinople (6th century), the long body of the church is covered by two domes.|$|E

In the event, the city fell by treachery in mid-August, when the Byzantine officer commanding the breach tried to open up separate negotiations with al-Mu'tasim, and the Abbasids used the lull in order to launch a surprise attack.|$|E

500|$|Krak des Chevaliers can be {{classified}} both as a spur castle, due to its site, and after the 13th-century expansion a fully developed concentric castle. It was similar in size and layout to Vadum Jacob, a Crusader castle built in the late 1170s. Margat has also been cited as Krak des Chevaliers' sister castle. The main building material at Krak des Chevaliers was limestone; the ashlar facing is so fine that the mortar is barely noticeable. Outside the castle's entrance was a [...] "walled suburb" [...] known as a burgus, no trace of which remains. To {{the south of the}} outer ward was a triangular outwork and the Crusaders may have intended to build stone walls and towers around it. It is unknown how it was defended {{at the time of the}} 1271 siege, though it has been suggested it was surrounded by a timber palisade. South of the castle the spur on which it stands is connected to the next hill, so that siege engines can approach on level ground. The inner defences are strongest at this point, with a cluster of towers connected by a <b>thick</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
500|$|The castle was {{extensively}} rebuilt {{in stone}} {{during the early}} 13th century. The stone keep, dating from the 1220s or 1230s, was constructed {{in the form of}} a circular great tower, with walls [...] thick and three turrets spaced evenly around the outside and a hall on the first floor. This circular design is particular to the Welsh Marches, and is also seen at Skenfrith and Caldicot. The reason for this choice is unclear, as it appears to have carried few military advantages. The stonework is made up of shale rubble with cut ashlar detailing; the walls are around [...] thick, but the keep's foundations are extremely shallow. An inner gate to the western baileys was built to a simple design with two small turrets, and seems to have been fitted with a portcullis, while a [...] <b>thick</b> <b>wall</b> encircled the rest of the inner western bailey; another stone wall seems to have protected the outer half of the bailey. Inside the inner western bailey appears to have been the castle's great hall and other service buildings. The work on the castle cost the de Lacys around £37, a large sum of money for the time. The settlement of Longtown was probably established at the same time as the castle, and initially prospered.|$|E

The side chapel has rectangular windows in the east and west walls from the 17th century; a narrow stone bench runs along the west and south walls of the chapel. The roof trusses, which date from the 15th and 17th centuries, are visible inside the building and the undersides are chamfered. [...] There are two rectangular windows in the north wall of the nave (20th century additions), matching the window in the north wall of the chancel.
