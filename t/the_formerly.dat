5|$|Before {{discovering}} that the incident had {{been caused by}} the accidental launch of two torpedoes by a drunken German crewman on the E-boat S-13, the German authorities in Bergen launched a search for saboteurs in the city.

5|$|Christian Lee Novetzke of the University of Washington {{suggests}} that Vithoba's worship migrated from Karnataka to <b>the</b> <b>formerly</b> Shaiva city of Pandharpur {{some time before}} 1000CE; but under the possible influence of a Krishna-worshipping Mahanubhava sect, the town {{was transformed into a}} Vaishnava center of pilgrimage. This proposal is consistent with contemporary remnants of Shaiva worship in the town.|$|E

5|$|In the 11th century, temple {{projects}} began employing soapstone, {{a form of}} greenish or blueish black stone, although temples such as the Mallikarjuna Temple at Sudi, the Kallesvara Temple at Kuknur, and {{the temples}} at Konnur and Savadi were built with <b>the</b> <b>formerly</b> traditional sandstone in the dravida articulation.|$|E
5|$|Most churches {{prior to}} the Reformation had painted walls, often with murals; these were {{whitewashed}} by the reformers, and often religious texts or the Ten Commandments replaced the images.

5|$|The franchise's first {{manager was}} Hall of Famer Harry Wright, who managed {{the team for}} eleven seasons. Frank Selee was the next manager to have managed the team for eleven seasons, {{with a total of}} twelve with <b>the</b> <b>formerly</b> named Boston Beaneaters. <b>The</b> <b>formerly</b> named Boston Braves made their first postseason {{appearance}} under George Stallings in 1914, winning the World Series that year. Several other managers spent long tenures with the Braves. Bill McKechnie managed the Braves from 1930 to 1937, while Casey Stengel managed the team from 1938 to 1942. The franchise was known as the Boston Bees from 1936 to 1940, and was again named the Boston Braves until 1952. Stengel also managed the Braves in 1943.|$|E
5|$|The volume {{continues}} briefly {{through the}} postwar period, where harsh experiences persisted even after slavery ended.

5|$|After {{the trade}} Chamberlain {{found himself on}} a {{promising}} Sixers team that included guards Hal Greer, a future Hall-of-Famer, and talented role players Larry Costello, Chet Walker and Lucious Jackson. Cherry remarks {{that there was a}} certain tension within the team: Greer was <b>the</b> <b>formerly</b> undisputed leader and was not willing to give up his authority, and Jackson, a talented center, was now forced to play power forward because Chamberlain blocked the center spot; however, as the season progressed, the three began to mesh better. Chamberlain did not care for the Sixers' coach, Dolph Schayes, because Schayes, according to him, had made several disrespectful remarks when they were rival players in the NBA.|$|E

5|$|Animal House {{inspired}} Co-Ed Fever, another sitcom {{but without}} {{the involvement of the}} film's producers or cast. Set in a dorm of <b>the</b> <b>formerly</b> all-female Baxter College, the pilot of Co-Ed Fever was aired by CBS on February 4, 1979, but the network canceled the series before airing any more episodes. NBC also had its Animal House-inspired sitcom, Brothers and Sisters, in which three members of Crandall College's Pi Nu fraternity interact with members of the Gamma Iota sorority. Like ABC's Delta House, Brothers and Sisters lasted only three months.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{hazardous}} nature of lead(II) nitrate, {{there is a}} preference for using alternatives in industrial applications. In <b>the</b> <b>formerly</b> major application of lead paints, it has largely been replaced by titanium dioxide. Other historical applications of lead(II) nitrate, such as in matches and fireworks, have declined or ceased as well. Current applications of lead(II) nitrate include use as a heat stabiliser in nylon and polyesters, as a coating for photothermographic paper, and in rodenticides.|$|E

The population increase associated with industrialisation resulted in considerable expansion, so that <b>the</b> <b>formerly</b> discrete settlements were absorbed into the current urban area, much of which dates from the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
