25|$|Finally, we {{actually}} don't need uDummy because it's there {{just to put}} all unmatched vertices of U in queue when BFS starts. That we can do as just as initialization. The vDummy can be appended in U for convenience in many implementations and initialize default pairing for all V to point to vDummy. That way, if final vertex in V doesn't have any matching vertex in U then we finally end at vDummy which is <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> augmented path. In above pseudocode vDummy is denoted as Nil.|$|E
25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} {{has been that the}} critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs. We could have stepped aside from that task and then shouted, and that would be <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> contribution... They would shout back at us {{and that would be the}} end of the story. I'm actually the only head of government that I know anywhere in the world who has actually gone to Zimbabwe and spoken publicly very critically of the things that they are doing.|$|E

60|$|After {{an hour or}} two of valiant {{achievement}} with {{knife and}} fork came the dessert; and at the point of the festival where finger-glasses are usually introduced, a large silver basin was carried round to the guests, containing rose-water, into which we dipped <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> napkins and were conscious of a delightful fragrance, instead of that heavy and weary odor, the hateful ghost of a defunct dinner.

500|$|In 1909, after Heinze {{abandoned}} his properties in Basin, the Butte and Superior Mining Company used buildings and machinery {{at the site}} of the Basin Reduction Works to treat zinc ore by a new process called froth flotation. Sued for patent infringement, the company shut down its Basin plant in 1912. Max Atwater, a mining engineer who had worked for Butte and Superior, obtained a license for the process and ran a smaller zinc-extraction plant in Basin from 1914 through 1918. His wife, Mary Meigs Atwater, described Basin as [...] "a mining camp, subject to recurring periods of [...] boom and bust... A tiny telephone office and a drugstore died with <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> era of boom... Just above the town were the headframe of our mine, and the old mill, and the never-quite-finished skeleton of a projected smelter." ...|$|E

As Hail to the Thief was the last album released on Radiohead's six-album contract with EMI, the band had no contractual obligation to release new material. Drummer Philip Selway said: [...] "It was definitely {{time to take a}} break. There was still a desire amongst us to make music, but also a realisation that other aspects of our lives were being neglected. And we’d come to <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> contract, which gives you a natural point to look back over at what you've achieved as a band."

500|$|In November 1943, when German-installed Latvian {{authorities}} {{threatened to}} resign over conscription, Berger suggested they {{be sent to}} a concentration camp. By the end of 1943, the former [...] "national legions" [...] had been significantly expanded. The Dutch regiment of SS-Panzergrenadierdivision Nordland was used to form an independent SS-Panzergrenadierbrigade Nederland, and a revamped Flemish contingent was assembled into the SS-Freiwilligen-Sturmbrigade Langemarck. The Wehrmacht also gave up its French volunteer regiment and the Wallonian Legion, which became the SS-Freiwilligen-Sturmbrigade France and SS-Freiwilligen-Sturmbrigade Wallonien. By {{the end of the}} war, all of these formations had been given divisional status in the Waffen-SS, {{despite the fact that they}} never grew to more than brigade strength. In relation to these recruits, Berger cynically observed, [...] "For every foreign-born soldier who dies, no German mother weeps". By August 1943, the crisis in the [...] "Germanic" [...] project was obvious, with Berger observing that [...] "we have come to <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> tether in the Germanic countries".|$|E

6000|$|... 3. Farther, {{you also}} falter here, {{as to the}} stating of the proposition; for in the {{beginning}} of your book, you state it thus: That the enduing men with inward real righteousness, or true holiness, was <b>the</b> ultimate <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Saviour's coming into the world, still meaning the holiness we lost in Adam. You should therefore in this place also, have minded your reader of this your proposition, and made it manifest if you could, 'that <b>the</b> ultimate <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Saviour's whole life and conversation, was the enduing men with this Adamitish holiness.' But holiness, and that holiness, is alone with you; and to make it his end, and whole end; his business, and the whole business of his life; is but the same with you.|$|R

Many traditional cultures have myths about the end of their world or civilization; however, these myths do not succeed [...] "in paralysing either Life or Culture". These traditional cultures emphasize cyclic time and, therefore, the inevitable rise of a new world or civilization on the ruins of the old. Thus, they feel comforted even in contemplating the end times.|$|E
