The {{situation}} was aggravated by a letter Beatrice then received from her elder sister Victoria Melita ("Ducky"), in which Michael was blamed for having callously initiated the doomed romance (when, {{a couple of years later}} Ducky, having divorced her first cousin Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, was told that remarriage to another first cousin, Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich Romanov, would likewise be forbidden by the Tsar, she refused to <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> answer; the couple eloped into exile).|$|E

Sam had tried to build herself {{a career as a}} model, but it had not gone to plan and she had ended up working as a hostess in a bar. Back in Walford Sam tries to {{continue}} her fling with David and when this goes nowhere she tries to come between Ricky and his girlfriend, Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). Initially Ricky thinks he still has feelings for Sam, but eventually realises he is better off with Bianca and tries to let Sam down gently. However Sam won't <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> answer and purposefully kisses an innocent Ricky in front of Bianca, causing them to split. Despite this, Ricky will not reconsider getting back with Sam and opts to try to make amends with Bianca. Sam is forced to admit defeat. Soon after, she meets a Spanish man named Guillermo, who is holidaying in England. When he invites her to join him in Spain she leaps at the chance and leaves Walford again in March 1996.|$|E
500|$|The {{office workers}} {{are forced to}} use the stairs while the {{elevator}} is being serviced, a situation everyone deems [...] "Stairmageddon". A badly out-of-shape Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) undergoes a painful struggle in climbing the stairs, only to be greeted at the top by Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) ordering him {{to take part in}} an important sales call. Unwilling to climb the stairs a second time, Stanley refuses. Since the client is a friend of Stanley, Dwight (who is operating without concern for niceties now that the documentary has driven home the point that he will never be the branch manager at Dunder Mifflin) cannot <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> answer, so he shoots Stanley with bull tranquilizers. With help from Clark Green (Clark Duke), Dwight gets Stanley to the car. The tranquilizers inexplicably make Stanley intoxicated, and his unusually jolly mood helps them close the sale. When Stanley regains full awareness, he is pleased to learn that he made a sale with no effort whatsoever, but still refuses to take the stairs again. He instead knocks himself out with one of Dwight's darts, leaving Dwight and Clark {{to figure out how to}} get him back upstairs.|$|E

500|$|Spotnitz's {{favorite}} magician was Ricky Jay, and so, for the episode, Jay {{was brought}} in to play the part of The Amazing Maleeni. Initially, however, the episode hit a snag. The production crew discovered that Jay's production agency had not been informed and that he would be unable to guest star in the episode. The staff's back-up magician, David Blaine, was unavailable for shooting as well. Series creator Chris Carter, however, later stated that the show would not <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> answer: [...] "We got on the phone with him. He agreed to come to our offices to talk about the script and ended up doing some card tricks for us that reduced Frank and I to being six-year-olds again." [...] Jay eventually agreed to do the part, but requested that he only do the tricks he was accustomed to doing. Thus, many of Jay's trademark tricks were included in the episode's script. Gilligan, in retrospect, later noted, [...] "There was no choice other than Ricky Jay as far as we were concerned. He was not looking forward to the idea of playing a magician because I think he felt that magicians were never portrayed very realistically in movies or television shows." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Red Hot Kinda Love" [...] {{was written}} by Aguilera, Lucas Secon and Olivia Waithe, with {{production}} done by Secon. An up-tempo song, it combines a variety of genres, including dance and disco, [...] "subtle" [...] tones of Latin, hip hop, and pop. It also features elements of dancehall. The track, which lasts for a duration of , is a [...] "smoky, sultry" [...] song. It features an [...] "old-school hip-hop loop" [...] and vocal samples, as well as [...] "dirty bass" [...] which creates an [...] "underground" [...] feel. On [...] "Red Hot Kinda Love", Aguilera keeps her use of melisma to a minimum which allows for a [...] "relaxed and playful" [...] vocal performance. Lyrically, the song talks about Aguilera's attempts to impress the man she is flirting with. She has [...] "fallen hook, line and sinker for him" [...] and will not <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> answer. Chris Younie for 4Music wrote that his favorite lyric in the song is [...] "Baby I'm burning up, you got that red hot kinda love", which the song's hook is built around. According to Sal Cinquemani for Slant Magazine, it features [...] "a catchy pre-chorus, and an even catchier chorus." [...] Andrew Hampp for Billboard compared the song's structure to those performed by Britney Spears and Kylie Minogue which they have [...] "specialized in for years." ...|$|E

The success of X-Men and Spider-Man without being star-driven pieces reassures [...] that the film does have an upside commercially." [...] However, in September 2006, Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the role. Favreau chose Downey, {{a fan of the}} comic, because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part, explaining [...] "The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark." [...] Favreau faced opposition from Marvel in casting Downey, but would not <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> answer, saying, [...] "It was my job as a director to show that it was the best choice creatively ... everybody knew he was talented [...] certainly by studying the Iron Man role and developing that script I realized that the character seemed to line-up with Robert in all the good and bad ways. While preparing for filming, Favreau and Downey were given a tour of SpaceX by Elon Musk.

2500|$|Derek is {{described}} by Inside Soap as [...] "a man who doesn't <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> answer", [...] "dangerous and edgy" [...] and [...] "the exact opposite of poor Alfie." [...] The magazine said that if Derek chose to have an affair with Kat, he could end up back in prison if Alfie found out and would {{be taken away from}} his daughter Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks). They later said that Derek had previously declared that he and Kat were [...] "two peas in a pod", which would [...] "make her very appealing to an egotist like Derek!" [...] They said that [...] "sparks would fly if Derek and Kat hooked up. He's got that dangerous edge that [...] Kat loves, but Alfie lacks! And we all know that Derek's a man who's used to getting what he wants—every time..." [...] Soaplife said that Derek is part of every other storyline and actor Foreman's contract was extended, so the chances of it being Derek are high, but they did not want it to be Derek. However, they later said they thought it would be Derek, as love is not Kat's motivation (ruling out Jack), and Derek {{is the only one who}} would not be cheating on a partner, saying the others [...] "would have to cheat on their other half [...] for no better reason than Kat has to cheat on Alfie (ie. none). And that would be too far-fetched." [...] They said Derek would probably enjoy the danger of being caught out by Alfie, and continued to rule out the other suspects, maintaining that they have seen nothing to change their minds that it is Derek. All About Soap wondered if Derek would have the time and inclination to woo Kat as he is struggling to bond with his children Alice and Joey Branning (David Witts), and opined that he would, and the fact that [...] "he's just the wrong side of dodgy, [...] right up Kat's street. Walford's creepiest couple could be on the cards!" [...] They made him their joint third favourite for the affair, along with Ray, and later said that an affair between Kat and Derek would be [...] "very believable" [...] but [...] "more than a little bit gross", noting that Derek is on a power trip and Kat loves to be dominated and as there is more to the affair than physical attraction, there would be a [...] "strong chance" [...] it would be Derek. Julie Emery of Heat said of the affair, [...] "Our money's on Derek. What a couple they'd make..." ...|$|E

As he drew near Mattuth this time, however, he was suddenly attacked by Masrur al-Balkhi, who had learned of 'Ali's plans.

In recent years controversy has arisen concerning the nature of heredity in essential hypertension.
