40|$|Two archetypes (more {{specifically}} a glass {{sheet on}} a circumferential frame and a circular point fixing) of adhesively bonded glass to metal connections {{are subjected to}} extensive research in a two-year project run by Ghent University {{in cooperation with the}} Adhesion Institute of Delft University of Technology. The main objective of the project is to facilitate innovations by providing technology transfer on adhesively bonded glass to metal connections to the building industry. Consequently, the project is coached by a varied group of industrial partners, which has specified five relevant applications and appropriate performance criteria to be further investigated. Over ten adhesive manufacturers and suppliers have been approached to suggest adhesives for these applications. Of the 48 suggested adhesives, about 30 have been subjected to experimental testing in a broad screening to be able to select adhesives for further detailed investigations. This way, also adhesives which usually are outside the scope of glass research could be investigated, such as methacrylates. Furthermore, each major adhesive family is featured: silicones, polyurethanes, MS-polymers, acrylates, and epoxies. The screening constits of lap-shear tests on three sets of specimens for each adhesive. The first set is <b>tested</b> <b>without</b> <b>conditioning.</b> the other sets were tested after 4 weeks storage at 90 °C, 50 % RH and 12 weeks of storage at 90 °C, 50 % RH. The proposed paper summarises the experimental results of the screening research. Adhesives are proposed for further detailed research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Two-bottle {{preference}} {{tests have}} often been used to make inferences about gustatory thresholds. The validity of such inferences depends {{on the extent to}} which taste differences produce differential fluid consumptions from the bottles. If equal amounts are consumed despite perceived gustatory dissimilarity, inaccurate threshold estimates result. Modifications of common preference-test procedures, interacting with tastant properties and genetic variation, disclosed instances of such non-discrimination among inbred strains of mice. With an hedonically neutral to mildly unpalatable tastant (sodium cyclamate), taste-aversion conditioning yielded lower thresholds. With a palatable tastant (maltose), <b>testing</b> <b>without</b> prior <b>conditioning</b> usually indicated lower thresholds. Descending concentration series produced lower thresholds than ascending concentration series, for both palatable (sucrose) and neutral (cyclamate) tastants. Previous experience with the tastants elevated preference scores, yielding lower thresholds with palatable tastants (sucrose, maltose) and higher thresholds with an unpalatable tastant (sucrose octaacetate). Within-strain discrepancies between thresholds indicated by the different methods were often large (2 — 3 log molar concentration steps). Among-strain differences of comparable magnitude, both in preferences and threshold estimates, were found for sucrose, maltose and cyclamate...|$|R

30|$|This is a {{misuse of}} {{quantile}} regression, however – one which should not replicate the positive wage effects, {{and would not}} detect a true positive wage effect. Neumark and Adams’ regression looks at the wage distribution <b>without</b> <b>conditioning</b> on skill, picks out those below the 10 th percentile in each city-month cell, and then estimates the effects of living wages on wages for them – asking whether living wage laws increase the wages of the lowest wage workers (those below the 10 th percentile). In contrast, a quantile regression conditional on skill asks whether living wages increase the wages of those at the 10 th percentile relative to wages of workers with similar characteristics, whether these workers earn high or low wages. But because living wage laws are simply floors on absolute wages, {{there is no reason}} to expect a general shift in relative wages within skill groups. Indeed, when Adams and Neumark (2005 a) estimate a quantile regression for the 10 th percentile <b>without</b> <b>conditioning</b> on skill, the estimated wage effect is similar to their original estimate.|$|R

The results from Sections 2 and 2.1 indicate that <b>without</b> <b>conditioning</b> on occupational outcomes, the earnings gap is even wider. It is possible that labor market discrimination against less-acculturated individuals is also reflected in restricted access to certain occupations or industries. The fact that the earnings gap persists even after controlling for occupation and industry suggests that less-acculturated individuals are both discriminated {{in terms of their}} job choices {{and in terms of the}} return to their work.|$|R

We report here a case of BMT <b>without</b> preparative <b>conditioning</b> regimen, and with a successful engraftment in a five-month-old infant with OS. The patient was transplanted with 15 x 10 (8) bone marrow mononuclear cells/kg, from his HLA matched brother, without preparative regimen and GVHD prophylaxis.

40|$|PURPOSES: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the environmental resistance of bio-polymer concrete for use of pavement materials developed for reducing the carbon-dioxide. METHODS: The compression, tension, and bending strength tests were conducted on the bio-polymer concrete specimens with and <b>without</b> environmental <b>conditioning.</b> The specimens were conditioned using the freezing-thaw and accelerated weathering process for long period of time. To assess the resistance against chloride, the chloride ion penetration resistance tests were carried out on the bio-polymer concrete specimens. RESULTS: Test results show that the maximum difference in strength between specimens with and <b>without</b> <b>conditioning</b> is about 2. 6 MPa indicating that the effect of environmental conditioning on specimen strength is negligible. Based on the chloride ion penetration resistance test, the penetration quantity of electric charge of the specimens is zero and there is no ion penetration within the bio-polymer concrete. CONCLUSIONS: It is found from this study that there is slight change in strength of bio-polymer concretes before and after environmental conditioning process and no chloride ion penetration observed in these specimens.
