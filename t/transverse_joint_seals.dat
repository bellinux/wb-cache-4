40|$|The Wisconsin Department of Transportation {{has been}} {{constructing}} jointed concrete pavements incorporating open graded permeable base (OGPB) layers {{for a number}} of years. The OGPB layer has been constructed using non-stabilized, asphalt stabilized, and cement stabilized aggregates of varying gradations. Test sections have been established throughout the State of Wisconsin and have been monitored for performance for the last 5 years. To date, little if any performance variations after limited trafficking have been noted for jointed PCC sections constructed over OGPB layers as compared to those constructed over conventional dense graded aggregate base layers. Data was collected along USH 18 / 151 in lowa/Dane Counties from a total of 17 test sections constructed to monitor performance variations due to base layer design, <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> <b>sealing</b> practices, and <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> doweling. The field data collected for this research included slab dimensions, surface detections from central slab and slab comer positions, and slab temperature measurements at various slab depths. In addition to the collected field data, construction records were reviewed to determine base layer design and pavement surface thickness as measured by cores extracted after construction. The data was used in conjunction with back calculation procedures developed by the author to establish slab-by-slab interior and corner foundation support k-values. The ratio of corner k-value to interior k-value, termed the slab support ratio, was used to identify slabs which were not uniformly supported by foundation materials. This research concluded that for the test sections included, little or no evidence of poor support could be found. However, based on the limited data obtained, there were some indications of poor support due to base layer densification. As a result of this research investigation, the author recommends a more detailed study of certain test sections included in this study to better quantify the reasons for the indications of poor support. In addition, testing is recommended along other jointed concrete test sections within Wisconsin to examine the impact of heavier trafficking on the quality of support provided by base layers of varying design...|$|R

40|$|Reflective {{cracking}} is {{a relatively}} premature distress that occurs in HMA materials overlaying cracked and jointed underlying pavements. The high concentration of stresses and strains {{in the vicinity of}} the discontinuity of the old pavement causes the cracks to reflect into the newly placed HMA overlay. While it is a common practice to use skewed <b>transverse</b> <b>joints</b> in rigid pavements to improve the latter's performance, the impact of such a practice on the cracking of a potential HMA overlay has not been examined so far.

Two sections of this bridge were salvaged and sent to Utah State University (USU) for destructive testing. Each bridge section consisted of two built-up steel plate girders intact with the precast concrete deck panels. The precast panels were designed and constructed to achieve full composite action between the deck and built-up steel plate girders through the use of Nelson shear studs.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Satisfactory {{performance}} of the <b>transverse</b> <b>joints</b> is crucial for achieving the intended service life of jointed plain concrete pavement. An accurate prediction of joint opening and movement is desired in order to quantify {{the effects of the}} environment, base type, concrete material constituents, and slab geometry on the concrete pavement responses. In this paper, an analytical model based on elasticity theory is presented to predict joint opening using a bilinear slab-subbase interfacial constraint assumption. The proposed model predicts the mean joint opening based on uniform temperature change and drying shrinkage through the slab thickness. To account for the temperature curling effect, a “correction ” term to the joint opening is proposed using a closed-form solution derived from Westergaard’s temperature curling deflection equation.

40|$|In {{contemporary}} practice continuously {{reinforced concrete}} pavements (CRCP) are terminated and anchored at each bridge approach. An approach slab, jointed at each end, provides the CRCP to bridge abutment link.

40|$|Concrete {{structural}} {{elements such as}} wall sections, bridge abutments and slabs on grade rely on dowels to transfer loads across the joints. As the joint width becomes wider, or if the joint is formed, the effect of aggregate interlock to transfer load is reduced and the loads are transferred by dowels. The dowels can be circular or elliptical shaped and are more commonly made of steel or Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP). This research project considered steel dowels with either a circular or an elliptical shape used in a highway or airport pavement. The following linear-elastic analysis, however, {{can be used for}} FRP dowels and for other doweled {{structural elements}}. Dowels are spaced along <b>transverse</b> <b>joints</b> in a highway or airport pavement. The dowel 2 ̆ 7 s main purpose is to transfer shear load across the joint which separates adjacent concrete slabs. Dowels are approximately eighteen inches (457 mm) long, placed at mid-height of the pavement thickness, positioned parallel to the pavement surface, and embedded symmetrically about the <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> centerline. The <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> was assumed to open, and its width is dependent on the combination of concrete shrinkage and slab contraction due to colder temperatures. Wheel loads from a single axle, positioned along the open <b>transverse</b> <b>joint,</b> apply a shear load to each effective dowel along the joint. Effective dowels are those dowels included in the distribution of the wheel loads. The shear load causes the dowels to bear against the concrete and causes the dowels to deflect within the concrete. These deflections are directly related to the bearing stress between the embedded dowel and the concrete (or contact bearing stress). The maximum bearing stress corresponds to the maximum deflection which occurs at the <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> face. If the maximum bearing stress does not exceed some portion of the elastic-limit stress for concrete, the deformed concrete around the deflected dowel will rebound to its original or reference state. Repetitive loading, however, may not allow the deformed concrete around the dowel to rebound to its original state before another set of wheel loads crosses the <b>transverse</b> <b>joint.</b> In this repetitive load case, permanent concrete deformation would be present. A need exists to reduce the bearing stress around dowels for maximum axle loading, as well as, repetitive axle loading. Therefore, a comparison was made between circular- and elliptical-shaped dowels with equivalent flexural rigidity. This dowel comparison showed that, for a given load, the elliptical shape with a wider cross section had reduced deflections within the concrete and, reduced bearing stress between the dowel and the concrete. Also, the deflections of the dowel within the concrete at the <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> face, for the circular and elliptical shapes, compare favorably with measured deflections found through experimental methods. Two published analytical foundation models for a beam on elastic foundation were used to determine the deflections of the embedded dowel within the concrete. The first foundation model {{is referred to as the}} one-parameter (or Winkler) model, and the second foundation model is referred to as the two-parameter model. The deflections along the dowel were found using each model 2 ̆ 7 s respective assumed displaced shape (general solution to the differential equation). The first model 2 ̆ 7 s general solution, based on the embedded length of the dowel, was divided into separate theories used for analyzing the dowel. The second model 2 ̆ 7 s general solution was simplified due to a slight modification. The contribution of this research project was to simplify beam on elastic foundation theory through matrix formulation and apply these improved analysis methods to dowels embedded in concrete pavements joints. One of these simplifications allows for the analysis of any dowel embedment length greater than about nine inches (229 mm). Dividing the dowel into smaller elements is not required in the solution. The analytical foundation models represented the concrete with linear-elastic springs. The spring stiffness for each model is given by elastic constants or parameters. Each model predicts slightly different deflection behavior for the embedded dowel based on these parameters. The first model assumes the springs act independently to support the dowel; whereas, the second model assumes interaction between adjacent springs. Modifications were made to the first model to include the effect of pavement thickness which allowed for comparison of both models. The theoretical bearing stress between the dowel and the concrete was determined based on the fourth derivative of the assumed displaced shape for a particular model. Therefore, the bearing stresses along the dowel-concrete interface are directly related to the corresponding deflections along the dowel within the concrete. The maximum theoretical bearing stress at the <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> face was compared to experimental bearing stress. The experimental bearing stress was calculated from the measured deflection of the dowel at the <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> face. The maximum bearing stress was limited to some portion of the elastic-limit stress for the concrete medium. For a given concrete depth below the dowel, as the load on the dowel is increased, the deflections along the dowel within the concrete and the bearing stresses along the dowel-concrete interface will increase. The analyses using the foundation models (described previously) showed, however, that as the medium depth below the dowel was reduced the dowel deflections within the concrete decreased. A decrease in deflection could be explained by the reduction in cumulative compression over the smaller depth. In addition, the analyses by these models showed that as the concrete medium depth below the dowel decreased the contact bearing stress increased. To verify the deflection behavior of dowels embedded in concrete, experimental testing was undertaken for various size steel dowels having either a circular or an elliptical shape. Three laboratory test methods were modeled using the stiffness method of structural analysis. Two elemental shear test methods and a cantilever test method were modeled. The elemental shear test methods investigated a single dowel that was embedded in concrete on either side of an open <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> and subjected to shear loading. The models, based on the assembled stiffness matrix, were used to determine the deflections along the dowel within the concrete and to verify elastic constants for a particular foundation model. Additional analysis of the elemental shear test specimens allowed for the inclusion of an elastic medium under a portion of the test specimen to model soil-pavement interaction. This analysis was referred to as the three-parameter model which defines a layered system. In this system, the embedded dowel and surrounding concrete are idealized as beams, connected together with springs and the concrete beam is further supported by an elastic medium...|$|R

40|$|Accelerated bridge {{construction}} has quickly become the preferred method for the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) {{as well as}} many other DOT’s across the United States. This type of construction requires the use of full depth precast panels for the construction of the bridge deck. The segmented deck panels produce <b>transverse</b> <b>joints</b> between panels and have {{come to be known as}} the weakest portion of the deck. Cracking often occurs at these joints and is reflected through the deck overlay where water accesses and begins corrosion of the reinforcement and superstructure below. For this reason post-tensioning of the deck panels is becoming a regular practice to ensure that the deck behaves more monolithically, limiting cracking. The current post-tensioning used by UDOT inhibits future replacement of single deck panels and requires that all panels be replaced once one panel is deemed defective. The new curved bolt connection provides the necessary compressive stresses across the <b>transverse</b> <b>joints</b> but makes future replacement of a single deck panel possible without replacing the entire bridge deck. To better understand the behavior of the new curved bolt connection under loadings, laboratory testing was undertaken on both the curved bolt and the current post-tensioning used by UDOT. The testing specimens included full-scale, full-depth, precast panels that were connected using both system. The testing induced typical stresses on the panels and connections, subjecting them to negative bending and shear. The overall performance of the curved bolt proved satisfactory. The moment capacity of both connections surpassed all theoretical calculations. The yield and plastic moments were 17 % and 16 % lower, respectively, than the UDOT post-tension system while at those moments deflection was relatively the same. Due to the anchorage location of the curved bolts, the reinforcement around the <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> received up to 5 times the strain of that of the post-tension connections. Although both systems performed well when subjected to shear forces and as compared to the theoretical capacities, the post-tension connection greatly surpassed the curved bolt in shear capacity...|$|R
