40|$|We {{present a}} {{powerful}} diagnosis {{tool for the}} IEEE Std. 1596 Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) : the SCI Tracer. The purpose of the SCI Tracer is to acquire data and analyze the activities on SCI links. The SCI Tracer consists of a hardware module and a software environment. The hardware is implemented in a multi-board module matching the Double Europe VME standard. It evaluates the flag bit in SCI packets and multiplexes SCI symbols in groups of four to reduce the high frequency of SCI packet transmission. The conditions which define acquisition and storage of SCI symbols and the usage of the Tracer registers are implemented as bitmaps in SRAM. With physically 256 Kbyte Tracer memory, much useful information can be saved, such as SCI packets, time stamps, etc. The UNIX based software environment consists of a hardware related programming language, called the <b>Tracer</b> <b>Control</b> Language (TCL) and a TCL compiler that translates a source program into Tracer SRAM bitmaps. 1.

40|$|A {{nitrogen}} balancing {{scheme for}} ocean color data assimilation in general circulation models is described {{and its potential}} for improving air-seaCO 2 flux estimates is demonstrated. Given increments for phytoplankton, obtainable from a univariate surface chlorophyll analysis, the scheme determines mixed layer concentration increments for the other nitrogen pools: zooplankton, detritus and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). The fraction of the phytoplankton increment to be balanced by changing DIN varies dynamically with the likely contributions of phytoplankton growth and loss errors to the error in the background state. Further increments are applied below the mixed layer wherever positive DIN increments in shallower layers would otherwise cause the creation of unrealistic sub-surface minima. Total nitrogen at each grid point is conserved where possible. The scheme is evaluated by 1 -D twin experiments for two contrasting locations in the North Atlantic, in which synthetic chlorophyll observations are assimilated {{in an attempt to}} recover known system trajectories generated by perturbing model parameters. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity <b>tracers,</b> <b>controlled</b> by the nitrogen dynamics, determine the biological modification of sea-water pCO 2 at the ocean surface. Assimilation affects DIC and alkalinity directly, the increments being inferred from the nitrogen increments, as well as having a post-analysis effect via the dynamics. It gives major improvements in surface pCO 2 at 50 N but less improvement at 30 N where errors in the phytoplankton nitrogen:chlorophyll ratio cause it to have a detrimental effect in summer. Beneficial effects of nitrogen balancing are demonstrated by comparison with experiments in which only phytoplankton and DIC are updated in the analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} of non-ideal flows in a continuous-flow mixing of non-Newtonian fluids is a challenging task for various chemical industries: plastic manufacturing, {{water and wastewater}} treatment, and pulp and paper manufacturing. Non-ideal flows such as channelling, recirculation, and dead zones significantly affect the performance of continuous-flow mixing systems. Therefore, the main objective {{of this paper was}} to develop an identification protocol to measure non-ideal flows in the continuous-flow mixing system. The extent of non-ideal flows was quantified using a dynamic model that incorporated channelling, recirculation, and dead volume in the mixing vessel. To estimate the dynamic model parameters, the system was excited using a frequency-modulated random binary input by injecting the saline solution (as a tracer) into the fresh feed stream prior to being pumped into the mixing vessel. The injection of the <b>tracer</b> was <b>controlled</b> by a computer-controlled on-off solenoid valve.

It was compared with 111 In-DTPA in colonic transit studies in nonconstipated control subjects and then in patients with idiopathic constipation. METHODS: Studies were performed after oral administration of 3 MBq (81 microCi) 67 Ga-citrate or 4 MBq (108 microCi) 111 In-DTPA in solution. Serial abdominal images were performed up to 96 h postinjection, and computer data were generated from geometric mean images of segmental retention of tracer, mean activity profiles and a colonic tracer half-clearance time. RESULTS: There were no differences in segmental retention of either tracer or in mean activity profiles between control subjects and constipated patients.

Quantitative {{myocardial}} perfusion measurements using positron {{emission tomography}} (PET) can be improved by introducing diagnostic tracers at a constant rate of activity. 82 Rb can be produced cost effectively by eluting a 82 Sr/ 82 Rb generator with saline; however, it exhibits an undesirable, but reproducible, activity rate variation.

This simplified approach allows us to characterize tracer diffusion under generic confinement by measuring their mean first passage time (MFPT). In particular, we show that the interplay between geometrical confinement and electrostatic interactions strongly affect the MFTP of tracers across corrugated channels hence leading to alternative means to <b>control</b> <b>tracers</b> translocation across charged pores. Finally, our results show that the MFPTs of a charged tracer in opposite directions along an asymmetric channel may differ.

Biosynthetic neural conduits could be an alternative treatment strategy in such injuries. The present study investigates {{the long-term effects of}} a tubular fibrin conduit on neuronal regeneration, axonal sprouting and recovery of muscle weight following peripheral nerve injury and repair in adult rats. Sciatic axotomy was performed proximally in the thigh to create a 10 -mm gap between the nerve stumps. The injury gap was bridged by using a 14 -mm-long fibrin glue conduit, entubulating 2 mm of the nerve stump at each end. A reversed autologous nerve graft was used as a control. The regenerative response from sensory and motor neurones was evaluated following retrograde labelling with Fast Blue fluorescent <b>tracer.</b> In <b>control</b> experiments, at 16 weeks following peripheral nerve grafting, 5184 (± 574 standard error of mean (SEM)) sensory dorsal root ganglion neurones and 1001 (± 37 SEM) spinal motor neurones regenerated across the distal nerve-graft interface.

The applied analytical methods are optimally adapted for extensive field surveillance of short-lived radiotracers. Dispersive physical mixing acting over time scales {{on the order}} of days is responsible for the distribution of 223 Ra, 224 Ra and 222 Rn in EB.

The factors regulating gap junction permeability, {{as well as}} the mechanisms underlying the developmental uncoupling process are not understood. To investigate the influence of protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation on dye coupling in the developing neocortex, pyramidal cells in slices of rat frontal and prefrontal cortex were injected intracellularly with the <b>tracer</b> neurobiotin. <b>Control</b> injections revealed clusters of about 30 dye-coupled neurons. Preincubation with forskolin or direct activation of protein kinase A with Sp-CAMPS reduced the number of coupled cells by about 70 %. A significant reduction in dye coupling was also observed following incubation with dopamine. Application of receptor selective agonists and antagonists revealed that the uncoupling was mediated by both dopamine Dl and D 2 receptors. The protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-CAMPS reduced the effect of dopamine, suggesting that the neurotransmitter regulates gap junction permeability via protein kinase A activation. In the presence of either forskolin, Sp-CAMPS, or dopamine, neurons displayed a significantly higher input resistance compared to control conditions. During the second postnatal week, transient application of forskolin to single neurons reversibly increased input resistance. At later developmental stages when coupling incidence had declined, this action of forskolin was no longer observed. Our data demonstrate a dependence of gap junction permeability on protein kinase A activity and on dopamine receptor activation in developing rat neocortical neurons. These mechanisms may modulate junctional permeability during the period of circuit formation.
