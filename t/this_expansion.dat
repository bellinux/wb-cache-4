5|$|Over time, the Universe and its {{contents}} have evolved; for example, the relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed and space itself has expanded. Due to <b>this</b> <b>expansion,</b> scientists on Earth can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. <b>This</b> <b>expansion</b> {{is consistent with the}} observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted; the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey. Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is accelerating.|$|E

5|$|Many critics {{compared}} Nuka-World to {{a previous}} expansion pack for Fallout 4 named Far Harbor. Dan Stapleton (IGN) {{said that when}} compared to Far Harbor, the role-playing elements are far less developed, though he also said Nuka-World has a nice setting filled with surprises and battles. Nicholas Tan (Game Revolution) also believed {{it was one of}} the better expansion packs, albeit not having such an in-depth a story-line as Far Harbor. Paul Tassi (Forbes) preferred Far Harbor due to <b>this</b> <b>expansion</b> being light on story.|$|E

The two buildings were connected by the Barnett Concourse, and two more major galleries were added. <b>This</b> <b>expansion</b> was completed in 1992. In early 2002, the museum {{acquired the}} adjacent Woman's Club of Jacksonville, a Tudor-style residential building which {{would serve as a}} space for programs and events for the museum.

5|$|The {{expansion}} adds new difficulty levels ('Beginner' and 'Expert') and new {{modes of}} play ('Arena Challenge' and 'Legend' modes). In 'Arena Challenge Mode,' the player can engage one-on-one duels against various opponents, where they'll be rewarded if they win. The new 'Legend Mode' elaborates {{on the individual}} prowess of each individual warrior within Dynasty Warriors. Individual weapons are given the availability to have an 11th evolved state, increasing the weapon's stats further. Due to the great emphasis in the duelling system in <b>this</b> <b>expansion,</b> it is at times seen as its own individual game - separate from the original Dynasty Warriors 4.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that this species has changed its natural habitat in at least parts of its range. In Germany and elsewhere in central Europe, it was found only in coniferous forest until the mid-1920s when its range rapidly expanded, first into farmland, and then to suburbs and urban parks. The reasons for <b>this</b> <b>expansion</b> are unclear. In areas of intensive farming, such as eastern England, arable land has in turn largely been abandoned in favour of built-up areas with their greater variety of green habitats.|$|E

5|$|To {{prepare for}} Olympic visitors, Beijing's {{transportation}} infrastructure was expanded. Beijing's airport underwent a major renovation {{with the addition}} of the new Terminal 3, designed by architect Norman Foster. Within the city itself, Beijing's subway was doubled in capacity and length, {{with the addition of}} 7 lines and 80 stations to the previously existing 4 lines and 64 stations. Included in <b>this</b> <b>expansion</b> was a new link connecting to the city's airport. A fleet of thousands of buses, minibuses, and official cars transported spectators, athletes, and officials between venues.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the War of 1812, the {{population}} of St. Louis and the Missouri Territory began expanding quickly. During <b>this</b> <b>expansion</b> land was donated for the Old St. Louis County Courthouse. The population increase stirred interest in statehood for Missouri, and in 1820, Congress passed the Missouri Compromise, authorizing Missouri's admission as a slave state. The state constitutional convention and first General Assembly met in St. Louis in 1820. Shortly thereafter, St. Louis incorporated as a city, on December 9, 1822. The first mayor of the city was William Carr Lane, and a Board of Aldermen replaced the earlier Board of Trustees. Early city government focused on improvements to the riverfront and health conditions. In addition to a street paving program, the aldermen voted to rename the streets.|$|E

5|$|Although Roanoke {{has never}} had {{international}} passenger service, in 2001, the Airport Commission was prepared to change the airport's name to Roanoke International Airport. This was the case as the U.S. Customs Service increased the radius covered by the inland port in Dublin to include Roanoke. <b>This</b> <b>expansion</b> allowed for the airport to add customs officials to accommodate both international travel and cargo to pass through Roanoke's facilities. However, the renaming did not occur {{as a result of}} the economic downturn in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 2007, the prospect of changing the airport's name was again mentioned as a possibility by the Airport Commission.|$|E
5|$|Chikka Devaraja (r. 1672–1704), {{the most}} notable of Mysore's early kings, who ruled during much of this period, managed to not only survive the exigencies but further {{expanded}} territory. He achieved this by forging strategic alliances with the Marathas and the Mughals. The kingdom soon grew to include Salem and Bangalore to the east, Hassan to the west, Chikkamagaluru and Tumkur {{to the north and}} the rest of Coimbatore to the south. Despite <b>this</b> <b>expansion,</b> the kingdom, which now accounted for a fair share of land in the southern Indian heartland, extending from the Western Ghats to the western boundaries of the Coromandel plain, remained landlocked without direct coastal access. Chikka Devaraja's attempts to remedy this brought Mysore into conflict with the Nayaka chiefs of Ikkeri and the kings (Rajas) of Kodagu (modern Coorg); who between them controlled the Kanara coast (coastal areas of modern Karnataka) and the intervening hill region respectively. The conflict brought mixed results with Mysore annexing Periyapatna but suffering a reversal at Palupare.|$|E
5|$|Due to the coyote's {{wide range}} and {{abundance}} throughout North America, it {{is listed as}} least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The coyote's pre-Columbian range {{was limited to the}} Southwest and Plains regions of the United States and Canada, and northern and central Mexico. By the 19th century, the species expanded north and east, expanding further after 1900, coinciding with land conversion and the extirpation of wolves. By this time, its range encompassed all of the United States and Mexico, southward into Central America, and northward into most of Canada and Alaska. <b>This</b> <b>expansion</b> is ongoing, and the species now occupies the majority of areas between 8°N (Panama) and 70°N (northern Alaska).|$|E
