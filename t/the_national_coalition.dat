5|$|In 2003, the Free Expression Policy Project {{assisted}} 33 academics {{specializing in}} journalism, with filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted {{the sale of}} violent video games to youths. In 2004 the organization operated at <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> Against Censorship. In 2005 the organization {{was part of the}} Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. Within the Brennan Center for Justice, the FEPP operated through the Democracy Program at the law school. In 2006 the organization, in collaboration with the Brennan Center for Justice, released a report on the inefficiency of Internet filtering. The 87-page report concluded that academic-based censorship of material on the Internet was far too broad and harmed free expression of ideas. The FEPP became independent from both <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> Against Censorship and the Brennan Center for Justice in 2007.|$|E

5|$|The Free Expression Policy Project (FEPP) is an {{organization}} devoted to assisting researchers with assembling information related to freedom of speech, media democracy, and copyright, and advocating for these issues.

5|$|As {{the leader}} of the NCP, the largest party in parliament, Jyrki Katainen was tasked with forming a new {{coalition}} government. He said that the result of the election supported a coalition consisting of the three largest parties, i.e. <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Coalition,</b> the Social Democratic Party and the True Finns. The most problematic question was believed to be the EU bailout policy, where the True Finns most differ from the other parties. Formal negotiations on government formation started after 24 April and the Kiviniemi government submitted its resignation on 29 April, starting to serve as a caretaker government until a new one was formed.|$|E

5|$|Several of {{the founders}} of the American Indian Movement, {{including}} Clyde Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt, Dennis Banks and Russel Means, were among the first to protest names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and Chief Wahoo. Vernon Bellecourt also founded <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> Against Racism in Sports and Media (NCARSM) in 1989. Cornel Pewewardy (Comanche-Kiowa), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture. Such practices can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism.|$|E
5|$|The Free Expression Policy Project {{was founded}} by Marjorie Heins, who became its initial director. It was formed as a nonprofit {{organization}}. Founded in 2000, the organization formed with goals of assisting researchers with assembling information related to freedom of speech, media democracy, and copyright, and advocating for these issues. It started as an outgrowth of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> Against Censorship. Prior to founding the organization, Heins served {{as director of the}} Art Censorship Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. The FEPP monitors incidents of censorship against artists, and is based in Manhattan, New York.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} {{resulted in}} a breakthrough for the populist True Finns, which came head-to-head with the three big parties, while every other parliamentary party in mainland Finland, excluding Åland, lost popularity. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> Party (NCP) also ended up as the biggest party {{for the first time}} in its history. The total turnout rose to 70.5% from 67.9% in the previous election; and corruption scandals also {{resulted in a}}n anti-incumbency vote. The incumbent, Centre Party-led coalition, which included the NCP, Green League and Swedish People's Party (SPP), lost its majority by two seats and their Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi of the Centre Party signaled that her party would then sit in opposition.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the election was magnified due to Finland's capacity to influence the European Union's decision in regard to affecting a bailout for Portugal via the European Financial Stability Facility, as part of financial support systems for debt-laden European countries, and {{the fall of the}} Portuguese government. Small differences in the opinion polls for the traditional three big parties (<b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> Party, the Centre Party and the Social Democratic Party) and the surprising rise in support for the True Finns also electrified the atmosphere ahead of the election.|$|E
5|$|Major {{political}} parties in Sarawak {{can be divided into}} three categories: native non-Muslim, native Muslim, and non-native; parties, however, may also include members from more than one group. The first political party, the Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP), was established in 1959, followed by the Parti Negara Sarawak (PANAS) in 1960 and the Sarawak National Party (SNAP) in 1961. Other major {{political parties}} such as Parti Pesaka Sarawak (PESAKA) appeared by 1962. These parties later joined <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>coalition</b> of the Alliance Party. The Alliance Party (later regrouped into Barisan Nasional) has ruled Sarawak since the formation of Malaysia. The opposition in Sarawak has consistently alleged that the ruling coalition uses various types of vote-buying tactics in order to win elections. Stephen Kalong Ningkan was the first Chief Minister of Sarawak from 1963 to 1966 following his landslide victory in local council elections. However, he was ousted in 1966 by Tawi Sli {{with the help of the}} Malaysian federal government, causing the 1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis.|$|E
