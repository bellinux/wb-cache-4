By the time of the advance into India, after the deaths of senior generals from the older generation, there had been worrying instances among senior officers of their own generation of treachery, a lack of sympathy with Alexander's aims of further integration of Persians into the army, and of sheer incompetence. Time after time, when Alexander needed to divide his forces he entrusted half to Hephaestion, knowing that in him he had a man of unquestionable loyalty who understood and sympathized with his aims and, above all, who got <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E

After knocking out the Hawks in straight sets, the Wildcats faced historical rivals the Adelaide 36ers in the 2014 Grand Final. After winning Game 1 in Perth {{on the back of}} a 30-point effort from James Ennis, the team headed to Adelaide looking to get <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>done</b> in two. But it wasn't to be, as the 36ers forced a deciding third game with an 89–84 win in Game 2. Returning to Perth Arena less than 48 hours later for Game 3, the Wildcats crushed the 36ers with a 93–59 win in front of 13,498 fans, as their 2–1 series victory saw them claim their sixth NBL Championship. Jermaine Beal was subsequently named the series MVP after Ennis struggled to make an impact in Games 2 and 3.

25|$|Belgium {{was short}} {{of people with}} {{tropical}} experience but Leopold was adept at recruiting other European nationalities for his schemes. Central Africa was a wild frontier attracting mercenaries for hire. At the recommendation of British-American explorer Henry Morton Stanley, who had already acted for Leopold in the Congo, the 27 years old Swahili speaking Captain William Stairs was appointed to lead the expedition, {{on the basis of}} his experience on the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition on which he had become Stanley's second in command. He had a reputation of someone who would obey orders and get <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>done.</b> That previous expedition had been marked by violence and brutality against any Africans who stood in its way as well as against its own African members. Canadian born at a time when it was part of the British Empire, Stairs had been educated partly in Britain and had joined a British regiment. He was considered to be and considered himself English or British.|$|E
25|$|Troy Percival was {{activated}} {{from the}} disabled list on September 2. In Toronto for his second outing since his return, he allowed a walk-off grand slam with two outs when the Rays were ahead by a single run and in position {{to win the game}} in extra innings. Against Boston during another extra inning game, Percival came in to close with a three-run lead and allowed the first three batters to reach base. He was removed from the game in favor of Jason Hammel, who had never recorded a save at the MLB level, and was the only remaining reliever available for the Rays in the game due to its length. Hammel converted the save opportunity, but many questioned if Percival should remain as the team's closer. The reason for Percival's removal from the game against Boston was a stiff back, and not for the game's situation, or for any sort of leg injury that had plagued him throughout the year. Percival stated that because of warming up multiple times throughout the game, only to not come in until the Rays took a lead, was what pained his back. Percival acknowledged that he knew he didn't feel well, and that he should have called for his own removal, but decided that with the lead the Rays had, {{he would be able to}} get <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>done.</b> As a result of the game, the Rays decided to not use Percival too often on consecutive nights, and using him in a tie game if the situation of the game changes while he is warming up. He would still be listed as the team's closer.|$|E
500|$|In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four-stars, saying [...] "Tomorrow Never Dies gets <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>done,</b> {{sometimes}} excitingly, often with style" [...] with the villain [...] "slightly more contemporary and plausible than usual", bringing [...] "some subtler-than-usual satire into the film". James Berardinelli described it as [...] "the best Bond film in many years" [...] and said Brosnan [...] "inhabits his character with a suave confidence that is very like Connery's." [...] However, in the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan thought a lot of Tomorrow Never Dies had a [...] "stodgy, been-there feeling", with little change from previous films, and Charles Taylor wrote for Salon.com that the film was [...] "a flat, impersonal affair".|$|E

500|$|While the Windows and Xbox 360 {{versions}} of The Orange Box were developed {{and published by}} Valve, {{the development of the}} PlayStation 3 port was outsourced to Electronic Arts.

We've done the PC and 360 versions here and EA has a team doing the PS3 version– and they'll make the PS3 version a good product; EA got <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>done</b> in putting {{a lot of people with}} PS3 experience on the project.

500|$|Johns {{impressed}} Australian {{officers with}} his sensitive handling of inter-Allied issues, his co-operative nature, {{and his ability}} to get <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>done.</b> Lieutenant General Edmund Herring, who came to regard Johns as a close friend, later described Johns and Secombe as [...] "born co-operators." [...] One of Johns' most important decisions involved {{the construction of a new}} deep-water berth for Liberty ships at Tatana Island. This involved building a causeway out to the island. The project would double the capacity of the port of Port Moresby, but in order to build it Johns had to divert the African-American 96th Engineers from work on the airfields around Port Moresby, raising fears from airmen like Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead that the airfields would not be ready for all-weather operations by the time that the rainy season arrived. Rains in late October did indeed close three airfields but the causeway opened on 30 October and the wharf accepted its first ship on 3 November.|$|E
