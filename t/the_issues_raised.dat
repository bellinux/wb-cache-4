5|$|In her 2006 book on Opus Dei, Maggy Whitehouse, a non-Catholic journalist, {{argues that}} the {{relative}} autonomy of each director and center has resulted in mistakes at the local level.

5|$|The book {{produced}} {{a wide range}} of religious responses at a time of changing ideas and increasing secularisation. <b>The</b> <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> were complex and there was a large middle ground. Developments in geology meant that there was little opposition based on a literal reading of Genesis, but defence of the argument from design and natural theology was central to debates over the book in the English-speaking world.|$|E

25|$|However, {{it would}} appear that many of <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> by the audit are not new. “An {{internal}} audit identified these same concerns over five years ago.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> by {{this affair}} {{did not end}} there.

25|$|Due to the {{complexities}} and interrelationships involved, {{this is a}} document that cannot be easily scanned. Readers will need to spend time understanding the dynamics and relevance of <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>raised.</b> At the risk of stating the obvious, the recommendations are also highly interrelated and should not be considered discrete advice. Such an approach could result in the essence of the report being misinterpreted.|$|E
25|$|If <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> by {{an unfair}} labor {{practice}} charge {{could also be}} resolved through the grievance and arbitration procedure of {{the collective bargaining agreement}} covering these employees, then the General Counsel may defer the case to arbitration. In those cases the General Counsel does not dismiss the charge, but holds it in abeyance while the parties to the contract arbitrate their contractual dispute.|$|E

25|$|A complainant's {{right to}} bring suit under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is not {{confined}} to charges as to which the EEOC has made a reasonable-cause finding, and the District Court's error in holding to the contrary was not harmless since <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> with respect to 703 (a) (1) were not identical to those with respect to 704 (a) and the dismissal of the former charge may have prejudiced respondent's efforts at trial.|$|E

Many books and articles dealing with <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> have since been published. The Anglican Bishop and theologian N. T.
