30|$|Recently, several {{research}} groups {{have focused on}} the problem of non-destructive measurement of the actual heat <b>transfer</b> conditions <b>of</b> <b>building</b> assemblies using thermal images. Madding's work (Madding [2008]) is one of the earliest studies that propose a method for analyzing thermal images to estimate the actual heat transfer conditions for building envelopes. Based on the environmental assumption of a steady-state heat <b>transfer</b> condition <b>of</b> <b>building</b> environments, this work measured the R-value of drywall assemblies using the indoor surface temperature data obtained from thermal images. The measurements were experimentally conducted in controlled lab environments, and then they were compared with the theoretical expected properties. Likewise, based on the similar environmental assumptions, methods proposed in (Albatici and Tonelli [2010]; Dall'O' et al. [2013]; Fokaides and Kalogirou [2011]) measured the overall heat <b>transfer</b> coefficient <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> assemblies. For validation, several experiments were conducted for a few standard wall assemblies. In these studies, the difference between the measured values using thermal images and the notional values was reported to be in the range of ~ 10 % (Madding [2008]), 10 - 20 % (Fokaides and Kalogirou [2011]), and around 15 % for cavity walls (Dall'O' et al.

40|$|The hygrothermal storage {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> an underground <b>building</b> envelope have discernible {{effects on the}} heat and humidity of the indoor environment.

This paper describes {{the development of a new}} hygrothermal model described with relative humidity and temperature based on the results of existing researches. The moisture model fully states actual moisture transfer process involving both vapor diffusion and liquid water migration in porous building envelopes. Verified using the results calculated by the mathematical model of Mendes et al., the new hygrothermal model can accurately predict the heat and moisture <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> envelopes. Hygrothermal absorption and desorption of three types <b>of</b> common underground <b>building</b> envelopes in Chengdu region in China are analyzed by using the new model. The results show that the hygrothermal absorption and desorption <b>of</b> underground <b>building</b> envelopes must be considered when the heat and moisture environment is controlled by HVAC.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Building energy use calculation programs require descriptions <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> geometry as well as data relating to climate, materials, occupancy, among other aspects. Powerful micro-computers and sophisticated building design software are responsible for more buildings being designed in electronic media. However, the geometric data <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> must still be manually entered as input data to energy calculation programs. Higher efficiency and accuracy in the building design and analysis process may be achieved by automating the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> three dimensional <b>building</b> geometry data form building modelling programs to energy analysis programs. Elink is a translation program that has been developed to automate the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> geometric data form a building design program (UprfrontR) to an energy catulation program (EnerCAD R). The modelling program, the energy calculation program, and the translator operate on 80486 EBM compatible personal computers.

The availability of multitasking in the Microsoft Windows operating environment on personal computers allows for the three programs to operate simultaneously, permitting a high degree of integration of design evaluation into the design process. This document describes the features of the modelling program and the energy analysis program, the design and development of Elink, the translation program.
