5|$|Despite the {{military}} and political weakness, during his rule Bulgaria remained a major cultural center and the ideas of Hesychasm dominated <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> Orthodox Church. Patriarch Evtimiy of Tarnovo became the most prominent cultural figure of the country. A number of texts were written or translated and an orthographic reform of <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> language was issued with synchronised rules. After the fall of Bulgaria, a number of scholars found refuge in the other Orthodox countries and brought the achievements of <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> culture to them.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surprise}} death of Malamir in 836, <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> throne passed to Presian I (836–852), who too was likely underage. As {{evidenced by the}} Presian Inscription from Philippi, Isbul retained his position as kavhan and his decisive influence in <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> court. In 837, the Slavic tribe of the Smolyani (Smolenoi), who inhabited the lower Nestos (Mesta) River and Western Thrace near Drama, rose against their Byzantine rulers. The inscription of Philippi mentions large-scale Bulgarian activity in the lands of the Smolyani. <b>The</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> forces were led by Isbul, {{as well as the}} ichirgu-boil (commander of the capital garrison) and the head priest. As the inscription is damaged, it is unclear who Presian and Isbul supported in that conflict. However, during this campaign <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> army conquered most of Macedonia including Philippi, where the inscription was found. From that point on, Isbul disappears from the sources, and there is no information about the date and circumstances of his death.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since its}} {{establishment}} Girdap served political interests, {{and it was}} later tied to the Popular Liberal Party of Stefan Stambolov. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> Commercial Bank (Balgarska targovska banka), which was also founded in Ruse in 1885, {{was close to the}} Popular Party. The two banks competed for lending municipal loans and regularly used their political ties in their competition. These relations were often damaging to <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> treasury, as politicians who were also bank shareholders or somehow related to Girdap awarded contracts based on their personal interest rather than that of the state. As <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> economy consolidated {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century and the emerging industry required increasing funds, local banks grew in importance. In 1911 Girdap had a capital of 2 million leva and by 1912 it was the third-largest private bank in the Kingdom of Bulgaria after <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> Commercial Bank and the Deutsche Bank-related Credit Bank (Kreditna banka). However, Bulgaria's privately owned banking sector remained comparatively small.|$|E

To save Diogenes, the 60-year-old Byzantine Emperor moved on {{with the rest of}} his army. When <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> understood that they retreated chased by Diogenes. According to the Byzantine historian John Skylitzes <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> had many casualties and 200 were taken prisoners.|$|R

The column of Major Gudzhev attacked the Šumadija Division and, despite being outnumbered 2 to 1, <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> managed to push the Serbs to the river Temska. The retreat of the Šumadija Division forced the Drina Division to pull back as well and <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> pursued after them. On the left flank, <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> were also successful and the Serbs were defeated.|$|R
50|$|The {{fighting}} was hard in Saint Sofia, where sergeant Avatzos's unit had {{the task of}} capturing <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> who were {{holed up in the}} church. At one point in <b>the</b> battle <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> raised a white flag. As soon as the Cretans advanced in order to arrest them <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> started firing again, wounding two gendarmes. Then the Cretans assaulted with fixed bayonets and captured all <b>the</b> surviving <b>Bulgarians.</b>|$|R

5|$|He was {{succeeded by}} his son Peter I, with George Sursubul, the new emperor's {{maternal}} uncle, initially acting as a regent.

5|$|For one {{decade in}} {{offensive}} after 976 <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> achieved major successes. Samuil managed to liberate north-eastern Bulgaria.

50|$|The Byzantines had an {{advantage}} in the beginning and managed to push <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> across <b>the</b> river. They were so infatuated with the chase of the retreating soldiers that they crowded on the bridge, which had been sabotaged before the battle by <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians,</b> and broke down. The river was very deep at that place and many Byzantine soldiers panicked and drowned, which helped <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> snatch victory.|$|R
5|$|In 968, Bulgaria was invaded {{from the}} north by the Kievan Prince Sviatoslav. By that time, <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> Empire, which had once {{threatened}} the existence of Byzantium under the reign of Simeon, had {{lost much of its}} power. During the conflict, the Kievan raids were repeatedly defeated by the Byzantines, who were also at war with the Bulgarians, a continuous conflict since the fall of <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> capital Preslav in 971. This war had resulted in <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> Emperor Boris II being forced to renounce his Imperial title in Constantinople, and eastern Bulgaria came under Byzantine rule. The Byzantines assumed that this act would signify the end of independent Bulgaria, but the western Bulgarian lands remained autonomous and under the Comitopuli brothers David, Moses, Aaron and Samuel, resistance against the Byzantines emerged.|$|E
5|$|In May 1916, the {{submarine}} {{was transferred to}} <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> Navy as Podvodnik No. 18 and commissioned in a ceremony that was attended by Crown Prince Boris and Prince Kiril. In Bulgarian service, {{the submarine}} patrolled <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> Black Sea coast and had encounters with Russian vessels on several occasions. After the war ended, the submarine was surrendered to France in February 1919 and scrapped at Bizerta in August 1921. However, in July 2011 Viceadmiral Manushev, Commander of <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> Navy, announced that the submarine, discovered in 2010 at the sea bottom {{near the town of}} Varna, is UB-8. Divers discovered manufacturer numbers and according to them the identity is confirmed.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} fighting between the rebels and the Byzantines continued. Although <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> forces were cut in two following the Byzantine landing at Varna, heavy clashes {{erupted in the}} eastern Balkan mountains with new vigour, especially around the Kotel Pass and the Varbitsa Pass. <b>The</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> positions there were surrounded both {{from the north and}} the south. The Byzantines had to besiege and take the fortresses one by one which cost time and casualties. Many strongholds remained unconquered and permanently engaged large Byzantine forces.|$|E
50|$|Sviatoslav Igorevich {{gathered}} 60,000 {{troops and}} started his {{campaign in the}} early spring of 968. He met <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians,</b> who were only 30,000 strong, near Silistra. The battle continued the whole day and until dark <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> seemed to have overwhelmed the Kievans, but, elated by Sviatoslav's personal example, the latter were victorious due to their still larger army. <b>The</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> retreated to <b>the</b> Silistra fortress and withstood the following siege.|$|R

5|$|In the meantime, <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> envoys {{received}} {{a warm welcome}} by al-Mahdi. The Fatimid caliph accepted <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> terms and sent his own emissaries to Simeon I. However, {{on the way back}} their ship was captured by the Byzantines, who managed to outbid the Bulgarians and distract a Fatimid attack. The Bulgarians remained in control of most of the Balkans, annexing Byzantium's ally Serbia in 924, but without naval support were unable to launch a decisive attack on Constantinople. The war continued until the death of Simeon I in 927, when his son Peter I (r. 927–969) concluded a peace treaty with the Byzantines, who recognized the imperial title of <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> monarchs and the complete independence of <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> Orthodox Church as an autocephalous Patriarchate in return for most of Simeon I's conquests in Thrace after 917.|$|E
5|$|In these areas, a Bulgarian {{resistance}} emerged, {{taking advantage}} of the Byzantine civil wars after the death of Tzimiskes in 976, led by the four sons of a count (comes) Nicholas, who became known as the Cometopuli ("sons of the count"). The most capable amongst them, Samuel, revived <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> realm, now centered in Macedonia, and was crowned Tsar in 997. A formidable warrior, he led raiding campaigns into Byzantine territory as far south as the Peloponnese, and he engaged the Byzantine emperor Basil II (r. 976–1025) in a series of wars resulting in the final conquest of <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> state by the Byzantines in 1018. Nevertheless, due to the events of 971, the Byzantines would never regard him as anything other than a rebel against imperial authority, let alone concede the principle of equality enjoyed by <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> rulers before 971.|$|E
5|$|Levski's death {{intensified}} {{the crisis in}} <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> revolutionary movement and most IRO committees soon disintegrated. Nevertheless, five years after his hanging, the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 secured the liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule {{in the wake of}} the April Uprising of 1876. The Treaty of San Stefano of 3 March 1878 established <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> state as an autonomous Principality of Bulgaria under de jure Ottoman suzerainty.|$|E
2500|$|Discontent {{with the}} {{supremacy}} of the Greek clergy started to flare up in several Bulgarian dioceses {{as early as the}} 1820s. It was not until 1850 that <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> initiated a purposeful struggle against the Greek clerics in a number of bishoprics, demanding their replacement with Bulgarian ones. By that time, most Bulgarian clergy had realised that further struggle for the rights of <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> in <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire could not succeed unless they managed to obtain some degree of autonomy from the Patriarchate of Constantinople. [...] As the Ottomans identified nationality with religion, and <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> were Eastern Orthodox, the Ottomans considered them part of the Roum-Milet, i.e., the Greeks. [...] To gain Bulgarian schools and liturgy, <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> needed to achieve an independent ecclesiastical organisation.|$|R

They sent their whole army against <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> but were decisively defeated {{in the battle of}} Achelous in 917. After several more victories Simeon I of Bulgaria prevailed.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> forces {{commanded}} by Ivan the Russian managed {{to withstand the}} four-month siege of Plovdiv undertaken by Andronikos III Palaiologos, claimant to the Byzantine throne, and his Bulgarian ally Voysil, despot of Kopsis. In their attempts to capture the city, the Byzantines employed German specialists to construct a siege machine, from which they fired with crossbows at <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> defenders. Despite the elaborate siege tactics, {{by the summer of}} 1323 the Bulgarians had not only retained the city, but also launched raids on nearby Byzantine-held fortresses in the Rhodope Mountains, such as Stenimachos (modern Asenovgrad) and Tsepina. Plovdiv was lost, however, to the Byzantines soon thereafter. As Ivan's forces were leaving the city to meet <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> garrison that was to replace them, the pro-Byzantine inhabitants of Plovdiv opened the city gates and let a covert Byzantine detachment in.|$|E

A stalemate ensued without any movement by either side; the front became known as Europe's biggest internment camp for the Allies by the Germans. This situation lasted until 18 September 1918, when the British and Greek Armies, {{under the command of}} General George Milne attacked in the Lake Doiran Sector. <b>The</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> Army—now in retreat—signed an armistice on 30 September 1918.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, Girdap was {{deprived}} of its government protections, {{as it had}} no links to the new agrarian government of Aleksandar Stamboliyski. In 1919 Boncho Bonev was imprisoned in Berkovitsa for eight months before he was acquitted, Ivan Kovachev was put on trial, and the bank's funds were sealed. In 1922, <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> National Bank closed Girdap's account, causing 38 million leva of deposits in Girdap to be withdrawn by 1923 and its debtors (including members of Girdap's management) to protest their bills. While at the time <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> National Bank, Girdap's most important creditor, was opposed to Girdap's declaration of bankruptcy, it reversed its stance two years later. Girdap was declared bankrupt on 3 February 1925 and its managers Boncho Boev, Ivan Kovachev and Nikola Kovachev were arrested.|$|E
5|$|After {{assuming}} the throne, Ivan Vladislav immediately sent a delegation to Basil II, which arrived {{five days after}} the fall of Maglen. In his letter, Ivan Vladislav notified Basil that he had personally murdered Gavril Radomir and had seized all the power in the country and promised Basil deep humility and obedience, an act of submission which some in the nobility supported. After Ivan Vladislav firmly secured his hold on the throne, however, he openly declared to be against any kind of compromise with the Byzantines and quickly began to follow the determined policy of his predecessors against the ongoing Byzantine conquest. Basil II soon understood that Ivan Vladislav's letter was a ruse and plotted a retaliatory action, bribing the kavkhan Theodore, who was in Byzantine captivity, to murder <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> ruler. Theodore in turn paid a trusted man in Ivan Vladislav's employ to commit the murder, but in the event the assassin actually killed Theodore himself. In the meantime Basil II continued his march, forcing <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> emperor to retreat to the Albanian mountains, and advanced into the heart of <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> state. The Byzantines took the capital Ohrid and burned the imperial palaces; news, however, arrived that Ivan Vladislav had laid siege to Dyrrhachium and that to the south <b>the</b> <b>Bulgarian</b> general Ibatzes had defeated the Byzantine rear army near Bitola. With his supply routes cut, Basil II had to retreat back to Thessalonica leaving a small garrison in Ohrid, which was swiftly retaken by the Bulgarians. Back in his base at Mosynopolis, Basil divided the Byzantine army to harass the areas of Strumitsa and Sofia. In January 1016 the Byzantine emperor returned to Constantinople.|$|E
