When Walternate tells them to stand down, Fauxilivia asks him about her recent mission to the prime universe and the part that she recovered.

5|$|State {{auditors}} Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe) and Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) soon arrive, and {{the extremely}} cheerful Chris paints an optimistic {{picture of how}} they will fix the budget, but leaves the details to the more serious Ben. When Ben explains {{they will need to}} slash the budget of every department by nearly 40 or 50 percent, Leslie angrily lashes out at Ben, who responds <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> poorly managed government is to blame. Later, at April's party, Tom desperately tries to pick up women, but to no avail, while Leslie and Ann get extremely drunk together. Andy and April appear to be getting along, but when he goes to the bar to get a drink for April, a drunken Ann flirts with him.

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to her barrier city, Aki joins Sid and appears before the leadership council along with General Hein (James Woods), who is determined to use the powerful Zeus space cannon to destroy the Phantoms. Aki is concerned the cannon will damage Earth's Gaia (a spirit representing its ecosystem) and delays the use of it by revealing {{that she has been}} infected and the collected spirit signatures are keeping her infection stable, convincing the council that there may be another way to defeat the Phantoms. However, this revelation leads Hein to incorrectly conclude that she is being controlled by the Phantoms. Aki and the Deep Eyes squad succeed in finding the seventh spirit as Aki's infection begins to worsen and she slips into unconsciousness. Her dream reveals <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Phantoms are the spirits of dead aliens brought to Earth on a fragment of their destroyed planet. Sid uses the seventh spirit to bring Aki's infection back under control, reviving her.|$|E
5|$|Captain Rachel Garrett of the Enterprise-C and {{her crew}} learn they have {{traveled}} into the future. Garrett explains {{that they were}} responding to a distress call from the Klingon outpost on NarendraIII, and were attacked by Romulan starships. While his crew works to repair the Enterprise-C and tend to the crew's injuries, Picard and his command staff discuss {{whether or not the}} ship should return to the past. Commander Riker argues that their deaths would be meaningless, but Data suggests that it would be considered an honorable act by the Klingons. Picard discusses the situation with Garrett, who tells him that her crew will serve the Federation in the present. Picard quietly reveals <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Federation {{is on the verge of}} defeat and the presence of one ship will make no difference, but if the Enterprise-C were to return to the past they might prevent the war from ever starting. Garrett agrees and announces to her crew that they will return through the anomaly; at that moment, the two ships are ambushed by a Klingon Bird of Prey. Garrett is killed, and her helmsman, Richard Castillo, takes command.|$|E

She was at first diffident as to her powers, but finally accepted the responsibility, and it was principally due <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> magazine became so popular. While keeping its character of a home paper, it steadily increased in influence and in circulation, and Booth's success was achieved with that of the paper she edited.

25|$|When Lucy {{returns and}} sees the Time Lord, the Doctor reveals <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> alien brains {{colonise}} planets by taking control of their prominent leaders, with Earth being their next target. Leaving Lucy to prepare {{for an interview with}} Grant's alter ego, the Doctor and Nardole track down the alien's ship in a low orbit and board it via the TARDIS. There, they discover that the ship's reactor is in a critical state and realise from Dr Sim that he intends to drop it on New York. Remembering an observation made by Nardole, the Doctor realises the city would be vaporised except for the Harmony Shoals building. World leaders would then take shelter in the company's other buildings within each capital city, believing Earth was under attack, effectively allowing the brains to take them over. After Dr Sim lets slip the ship is to be dropped at a designated time, the Doctor forces its descent ahead of schedule.|$|E

The three then take the Predator back to Zamaron, however when Carol discovers the intentions of the Zamarons, she argues that the Guardians' technology that the Zamarons-based the battery on can be powered by the ambient love in the universe and refused to deliver the Predator. Upon hearing Carol's words, the Zamaron Queen Aga'po used the last of her life force to charge the Central Power Battery, leaving her title of Queen of the Star Sapphires to Carol.|$|E

25|$|By spring 705, Wu Zetian {{was seriously}} ill again. Zhang Jianzhi, Jing Hui, and Yuan Shuji, planned a coup {{to kill the}} Zhang brothers.

With agreement from Li Xian as well, they acted on 20 February, killing Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, and then they had Changsheng Hall (長生殿), where Wu Zetian was residing, surrounded. They then reported <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Zhang brothers had been executed for treason, and they then forced her to yield the throne to Li Xian. On 21 February, an edict was issued in her name that made Li Xian regent, and on 22 February, an edict was issued in her name passing the throne to Li Xian. On 23 February, Li Xian formally retook the throne, and the next day, Wu Zetian, under heavy guard, {{was moved to the}} subsidiary palace, Shangyang Palace (上陽宮), but was nevertheless honoured with the title of Empress Regnant Zetian Dasheng (則天大聖皇帝).

25|$|Carol Ferris {{once again}} gains the {{attention}} of the Zamarons as well. After a divorce and giving up the chance at being with Hal Jordan, he is no longer in her life and a hole in her heart has formed. While flying his former plane, the Zamarons send her one of their new violet power rings to fill it. Ferris' reunion with the violet light is not fully shown until Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps #2 (July 2009). In Tales of the Star Sapphires: Lost Love, Ferris initially expects to be possessed by her violet power ring as had been the case with the Star Sapphire gem. The ring explains <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Zamarons have changed service to the Star Sapphires: it must be voluntary and now extends to an entire violet Corps. The ring reveals that Ferris has the potential of becoming the most powerful Star Sapphire, and also has the ability of leading the Star Sapphires into war alongside the Green Lantern Corps. At the end of the story, the power ring keeps its word and does not recruit Ferris until she gives it permission. She is, however, manipulated by being told that her love (Hal Jordan) may die depending upon the outcome of the War of Light. By joining the Star Sapphires, Ferris may be able to prevent that from happening.|$|E
