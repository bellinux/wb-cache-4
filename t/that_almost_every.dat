During this period, Mexico experienced {{the rise of}} three powerful drug cartels: the Tijuana Cartel in the west; the Juárez Cartel in Ciudad Juárez; and the Gulf Cartel in the east. Blancornelas' stories are considered so crucial <b>that</b> <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> written account of the Tijuana Cartel cites him.|$|E
5|$|Several nearby office blocks {{were hit}} so badly <b>that</b> <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> window, front and back, was blown {{in as the}} {{explosion}} ripped through them. The timing of the explosion before work hours possibly prevented additional casualties. Reports also indicated that cars in nearby streets caught fire. The roof {{of at least one}} house was blown off. Buildings in the vicinity were evacuated by police, {{not only because of the}} smoke and possibility of more explosions, but because of the danger of structural damage making the buildings unstable.|$|E

25|$|During the 18th century, the Dutch {{settlement}} {{in the area of}} the cape grew and prospered. By the late 1700s the Cape Colony was one of the best developed European settlements outside Europe or the Americas. The two bases of the Cape Colony's economy for almost the entirety of its history were shipping and agriculture. Its strategic position meant <b>that</b> <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> ship sailing between Europe and Asia stopped off at the colony's capital Cape Town. The supplying of these ships with fresh provisions, fruit, and wine provided a very large market for the surplus produce of the colony.|$|E

Nor did he find Southland Corp. v. Keating, in which the Court held the FAA applied to contracts executed under state law, applicable, since in that case the Court had considered a law unique to California whereas here it was dealing with a law parallel to a federal statute <b>that</b> <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> state had enacted.|$|E

25|$|The {{population}} of Scotland grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901. Even {{with the development}} of industry there were insufficient good jobs; as a result, during the period 1841-1931, about 2 million Scots migrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England. Scotland lost a much higher proportion of its population than England and Wales, reaching perhaps as much as 30.2 per cent of its natural increase from the 1850s onwards. This not only limited Scotland's population increase, but meant <b>that</b> <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> family lost members due to emigration and, because more of the migrants were young males, it skewed the sex and age ratios of the country.|$|E
25|$|Avatars {{may take}} any form users choose (human, animal, vegetable, mineral, or a {{combination}} thereof) or residents may choose to resemble themselves {{as they are in}} real life. They may choose even more abstract forms, given <b>that</b> <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> aspect of an avatar is fully customizable. Second Life Culture consists of many activities and behaviors that are also present in real life. A single resident account may have only one avatar at a time, although the appearance of this avatar can change between as many different forms as the Resident wishes. Avatar forms, like almost everything else in Second Life, can be either created by the user, or bought pre-made. A single person may also have multiple accounts, and thus appear to be multiple Residents (a person's multiple accounts are referred to as alts).|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{original}} British road system was poorly maintained by thousands of local parishes, but from the 1720s (and occasionally earlier) turnpike trusts were set up to charge tolls and maintain some roads. Increasing numbers of main roads were turnpiked from the 1750s to the extent <b>that</b> <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> main road in England and Wales was the responsibility of a turnpike trust. New engineered roads were built by John Metcalf, Thomas Telford and most notably John McAdam, with the first 'macadamised' stretch of road being Marsh Road at Ashton Gate, Bristol in 1816. The major turnpikes radiated from London and were {{the means by which}} the Royal Mail was able to reach the rest of the country. Heavy goods transport on these roads was by means of slow, broad wheeled, carts hauled by teams of horses. Lighter goods were conveyed by smaller carts or by teams of pack horse. Stage coaches carried the rich, and the less wealthy could pay to ride on carriers carts.|$|E

25|$|Another line of {{research}} at Liverpool was measuring the fission cross section of uranium-235, on which Frisch and Peierls' calculations depended. They had assumed <b>that</b> <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> collision between a neutron of any energy and a uranium-235 nucleus would produce a fission. The value they used for the cross section was that published by French researchers in 1939. But was it correct? Data published by the Americans in the 15 March and 15 April 1940 issues of Physical Review indicated that the fission cross section was much smaller. No pure uranium-235 was available, so experiments at Liverpool were conducted with natural uranium. The results were inconclusive, but tended to support Frisch and Peierls. By March 1941, the Alfred Nier had managed to produce a microscopic amount of uranium-235 in the United States, and a team under Merle Tuve at the Carnegie Institution of Washington was measuring the cross section. The uranium-235 was too valuable to send a sample to Britain, so Chadwick sent the Americans a list of measurements {{he wanted them to}} carry out. The final result was that the cross section was larger than Frisch and Peierls had assumed, but the resulting critical mass was still only about 8 kilograms.|$|E

40|$|A natural {{generalization}} of interval exchange maps are linear involutions, first introduced by Danthony and Nogueira. Recurrent train tracks {{with a single}} switch which we call non-classical interval exchanges, form a subclass of linear involutions without flips. They are analogs of classical interval exchanges, and are first return maps for non-orientable measured foliations associated to quadratic differentials on Riemann surfaces. We show that every transformation is disjoint from <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> irreducible non-classical interval exchange.
