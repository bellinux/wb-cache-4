This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic auto-immune disease characterized by inflammation and joint destruction that causes significant morbidity and mortality. However, the combined use of methotrexate (MTX), a synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (sDM-ARD) and biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) has revolu-tionized treatment of RA and clinical remission or low disease activity (LDA) are now realistic targets, achieved {{by a large}} proportion of RA patients. We are now in a position to evaluate if it is possible to maintain remission or LDA {{while at the same time}} reducing the burden of treatment on the patient and healthcare system. Data are emerging from large, well-conducted studies designed to answer this question, shedding light on which patient populations and treatment algorithms can survive treatment discontinuation or tapering with low risk of disease flare. For early RA, approximately half of early RA patients could discontinue TNF-targeted bDMARDs without clini-cal flare and functional impairment after obtaining clinical remission by bDMARDs with MTX. In contrast, for established RA, fewer patients sustained remission or LDA after the discontinuation of bDMARDs and ‘‘deep remis-sion’ ’ at the discontinuation was a key factor to maintain the <b>treatment</b> <b>holiday</b> of bDMARDs. Thus, this article provides a brief outline on withdrawing or tapering bDMARDs once patients have achieved remission or LDA in RA. Key Points The discontinuation of biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) is possible without clinical flare and functional impairment for early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with low disease activity or remission. For patients with established RA, ‘‘deep remission’’ at the time of discontinuation is required to maintain the <b>treatment</b> <b>holiday</b> from bDMARDs. ‘‘Treatment holiday’ ’ from bDMARDS following early intensive treatment may be beneficial for reduction of drug-induced adverse effects and costs. ...|$|E

40|$|After nearly 40 {{years of}} {{treatment}} of metastatic colorectal cancer with 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) or best supportive care, {{the treatment of}} this disease has evolved rapidly in the last decade. Treatment options now include several new cytotoxic and biologic agents. Combination regimens, such as folinic acid, 5 -FU plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), and folinic acid, 5 -FU plus irinotecan (FOLFIRI), have significantly improved clinical efficacy as related to response rates and overall survival. The optimum integration of chemotherapy regimens with biological agents targeting critical signaling pathways, such as, bevacizumab (monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF-A), cetuximab and panitumumab (monoclonal antibodies targeting the EGF receptor) are still under evaluation. With the availability of several treatment options, however, comes the issue of optimal duration of chemotherapy {{in order to achieve}} the dual goals of clinical efficacy and quality of life, and the issue of cost–effectiveness of treatment, particularly with the newer targeted therapies.

40|$|Background: When cure is impossible, cancer {{treatment}} {{should focus on}} both length and quality of life. Maximisation of time without toxic effects could be one effective strategy to achieve both of these goals. The COIN trial assessed preplanned <b>treatment</b> <b>holidays</b> in advanced colorectal cancer to achieve this aim. Methods: COIN was a randomised controlled trial in patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer. Patients received either continuous oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine combination (arm A), continuous chemotherapy plus cetuximab (arm B), or intermittent (arm C) chemotherapy. In arms A and B, treatment continued until development of progressive disease, cumulative toxic effects, or the patient chose to stop. In arm C, patients who had not progressed at their 12 -week scan started a chemotherapy-free interval until evidence of disease progression, when the same treatment was restarted. Randomisation was done centrally (via telephone) by the MRC Clinical Trials Unit using minimisation. Treatment allocation was not masked. The comparison of arms A and B is described in a companion paper. Here, we compare arms A and C, with the primary objective of establishing whether overall survival on intermittent therapy was non-inferior to that on continuous therapy, with a predefined non-inferiority boundary of 1 · 162.

40|$|The {{development}} of recombinantly manufactured enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has revolutionised {{the management of}} some inherited disorders of metabolism. Gaucher disease was the first lysosomal storage disorder for which ERT became commercially available and ERT remains first-line treatment for affected individuals. In Australia, 70 patients with Gaucher disease are treated through a centrally administered Australian Government national program known as the Life Savings Drug Program (LSDP). Imiglucerase (Cerezyme), manufactured by Genzyme Corporation, is the only ERT currently registered in Australia {{for the treatment of}} Gaucher disease. In June 2009, Genzyme Corporation announced the detection of a virus in its Allston Landing manufacturing facility which resulted in inventories of imiglucerase being insufficient to meet projected global demand. The Australian Government sought advice from its Gaucher Disease Advisory Committee (GDAC) on recalculating patient doses in order to ration available imiglucerase to those most in need on a clinical severity basis. Management of this rationing process was urgent and required extensive investigation to develop a clinical severity hierarchy, to review available imiglucerase stock spread across multiple pharmacies, to implement a strategy for redistributing available imiglucerase according to specific patients' recalculated doses, to advise treating doctors and patients concerning these changed circumstances and to consider new monitoring schedules during the drug shortage phase. A cohort of 24 patients was withdrawn from therapy, 22 of whom had no discernable clinical adverse effect. This experience suggests that short-term studies of maintenance therapy without a no-treatment arm may lead to erroneous conclusions and that some patients may have <b>treatment</b> <b>holidays</b> or delayed infusions without short-term adverse outcomes.

40|$|Long-term {{success of}} HIV {{antiretroviral}} therapy requires near-perfect adherence, maintained throughout one's lifetime. However, perceptions towards ART {{and patterns of}} adherence may change during the life course. We assessed challenges to long-term adherence in adolescents and adults in three regional HIV treatment centers in Uganda. We conducted 24 in-depth interviews and 2 focus group discussions {{with a total of}} 33 health-care providers and expert clients (HIV patients on long-term ART who assist with adherence support of fellow patients). Interview topics included experiences with patients on long-term treatment with either declining adherence or persistent poor adherence. Transcribed texts were coded and analyzed based on the social-ecological framework highlighting differences and commonalities between adolescents and adults. The overarching themes in adolescents were unstructured <b>treatment</b> <b>holidays,</b> delays in disclosure of HIV status by caretakers, stigma, which was mainly experienced in boarding schools, and diminishing or lack of clinical support. In particular, there was minimal support for early and gradual disclosure for caretakers to the infected children, diminishing clinical support for young adults during transition to adult-based care and declining peer-to-peer support group activities. The predominating theme in adults was challenges with treatment access among temporary economic migrants. Common themes to adults and adolescents were challenges with disclosure in intimate relationships, treatment related factors including side effects, supply of single tablets in place of fixed-dose combined drugs, supply of drug brands with unfavorable taste and missed opportunities for counseling due to shortage of staff. Adherence counseling and support should be adapted differently for adolescents and adults and to the emerging life course challenges in long-term treated patients.

The Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE) coordinates a five-year study that has been implemented in various African countries, including Mozambique. The overall goal of SCORE was to better understand how to best apply preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel (PZQ) for schistosomiasis control by evaluating the impact of alternative treatment approaches. METHODS: This was a cluster-randomised trial that compared the impact of different treatment strategies in study areas with prevalence among school children of ≥ 21 % S. haematobium infection by urine dipstick. Each village was randomly allocated to one of six possible combinations of community-wide treatment (CWT), school-based treatment (SBT), and/or drug holidays {{over a period of}} four years, followed by final data collection in the fifth year. The most intense intervention arm involved four years of CWT, while the least intensive arm involved two years of SBT followed by two consecutive years of PZQ holiday. Each study arm included 25 villages {{randomly assigned to one of}} the six treatment arms. The primary outcome of interest was change in prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium among 100 children aged 9 -to- 12 -years that were sampled each year in every village. In addition to children aged 9 -to- 12 years, 100 children aged 5 - 8 years in their first-year of school and 50 adults (aged 20 - 55 years) were tested in the first and final fifth year of the study. Prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium infection was evaluated by two filtrations, each of 10 mL, from a single urine specimen. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In total, data was collected from 81, 167 individuals across 149 villages in ten districts of Cabo Delgado province, Northern Mozambique. Overall PZQ treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the prevalence of S. haematobium infection from Year 1 to Year 5, where the average prevalence went from 60. 5 % to 38. 8 %, across all age groups and treatment arms. The proportion of those heavily infected also reduced from 17. 6 % to 11. 9 % over five years. There was a significantly higher likelihood of males being infected than females at baseline, but no significant difference between the sexes in their response to treatment. The only significant response based on a study arm was seen in both the 9 -to- 12 -year-old and first-year cross sections, where two consecutive <b>treatment</b> <b>holidays</b> resulted in a significantly higher final prevalence of S. haematobium than no <b>treatment</b> <b>holidays.</b> When the arms were grouped together, four rounds of treatment (regardless of whether it was CWT or SBT), however, did result in a significantly greater reduction in S. haematobium prevalence than two rounds of treatment (i. e. with two intermittent or consecutive holiday years) over a five-year period. CONCLUSIONS: Although PC was successful in reducing the burden of active infection, even among those heavily infected, annual CWT did not have a significantly greater impact on disease prevalence or intensity than less intense treatment arms. This may be due to extremely high starting prevalence and intensity in the study area, with frequent exposure to reinfection, or related to challenges in achieving high treatment coverage More frequent treatment had a greater impact on prevalence and intensity of infection when arms were grouped by number of treatments, however, cost efficiency was greater in arms only receiving two treatments. Finally, a significant reduction in prevalence of S. haematobium was seen in adults even in the SBT arms implying the rate of transmission in the community had been decreased, even where only school children have been treated, which has significant logistical and cost-saving implications for a national control programme in justifying CWT...|$|R

5000|$|A {{key point}} in {{electricity}} spot price modeling and forecasting {{is the appropriate}} treatment of seasonality. And {{it should be emphasized}} that the electricity price exhibits seasonality at three levels: the daily and weekly, and to some extent - the annual. In short-term forecasting, the annual or long-term seasonality is usually ignored, but the daily and weekly patterns (including a separate <b>treatment</b> of <b>holidays)</b> are of prime importance. This, however, may not be the right approach. As Nowotarski and Weron have recently shown, decomposing a series of electricity prices into a long-term seasonal and a stochastic component, modeling them independently and combining their forecasts can bring - contrary to a common belief - an accuracy gain compared to an approach in which a given model is calibrated to the prices themselves.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The results {{presented}} here {{are part of}} a five-year cluster-randomised intervention trial that was implemented to understand how best to gain and sustain control of schistosomiasis through different preventive chemotherapy strategies. This paper presents baseline data that were collected in ten districts of Cabo Delgado province, northern Mozambique, before treatment. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 19, 039 individuals was sampled from 144 villages from May to September 2011. In each village prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium were investigated in 100 children first-year students (aged 5 - 8  years), 100 school children aged 9 - 12  years (from classes 2 to 7) and 50 adults (20 - 55  years). Prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium infection were evaluated microscopically by two filtrations, each of 10  ml, from a single urine specimen. Given that individual and community perceptions of schistosomiasis influence control efforts, community knowledge and environmental risk factors were collected using a face-to-face interview. Data were entered onto mobile phones using EpiCollect. Data summary was made using descriptive statistics. Chi-square and logistic regression were used to determine the association between dependent and independent variables. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis was 60. 4 % with an arithmetic mean intensity of infection of 55. 8 eggs/ 10  ml of urine. Heavy infections were detected in 17. 7 %, of which 235 individuals (6. 97 %) had an egg count of 1000 eggs/ 10  ml or more. There was a significantly higher likelihood of males being infected than females across all ages (62 % vs 58 %; P[*]<[*] 0. 0005). Adolescents aged 9 - 12  years had a higher prevalence (66. 6 %) and mean infection intensity (71. 9 eggs/ 10  ml) than first-year students (63. 1 %; 58. 2 eggs/ 10  ml). This is the first study in Mozambique looking at infection rates among adults. Although children had higher levels of infection, it was found here that adults had a high average prevalence and intensity of infection (44. 5 %; 23. 9 eggs/ 10  ml). Awareness of schistosomiasis was relatively high (68. 6 %); however, correct knowledge of how schistosomiasis is acquired was low (23. 2 %) among those who had heard of the disease. Schistosomiasis risk behaviour such as washing (91. 3 %) and bathing (86. 7 %) in open water sources likely to be infested with host snails was high. CONCLUSIONS: Urogenital schistosomiasis is widespread in Cabo Delgado. In addition, poor community knowledge about the causes of schistosomiasis and how to prevent it increases the significant public health challenge for the national control program. This was the first study in Mozambique that examined infection levels among adults, where results showed that S. haematobium infection was also extremely high. Given that this controlled trial aims to understand the impact of different combinations of schistosomiasis control through treatment of communities, schools, and <b>treatment</b> <b>holidays</b> over a five-year period, these findings highlight the importance of examining the impact of different treatment approaches also in adults.

Here, we compare arms A and C, with the primary objective of establishing whether overall survival on intermittent therapy was non-inferior to that on continuous therapy, with a predefined non-inferiority boundary of 1. 162. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analyses were done. This trial is registered, ISRCTN 27286448. FINDINGS: 1630 patients {{were randomly assigned to}} treatment groups (815 to continuous and 815 to intermittent therapy). Median survival in the ITT population (n= 815 in both groups) was 15. 8 months (IQR 9. 4 - 26. 1) in arm A and 14. 4 months (8. 0 - 24. 7) in arm C (hazard ratio [HR] 1. 084, 80 % CI 1. 008 - 1. 165). In the per-protocol population (arm A, n= 467; arm C, n= 511), median survival was 19. 6 months (13. 0 - 28. 1) in arm A and 18. 0 months (12. 1 - 29. 3) in arm C (HR 1. 087, 0. 986 - 1. 198). The upper limits of CIs for HRs in both analyses were greater than the predefined non-inferiority boundary. Preplanned subgroup analyses in the per-protocol population showed that a raised baseline platelet count, defined as 400, 000 per μL or higher (271 [28 %] of 978 patients), was associated with poor survival with intermittent chemotherapy: the HR for comparison of arm C and arm A in patients with a normal platelet count was 0. 96 (95 % CI 0. 80 - 1. 15, p= 0. 66), versus 1. 54 (1. 17 - 2. 03, p= 0. 0018) in patients with a raised platelet count (p= 0. 0027 for interaction). In the per-protocol population, more patients on continuous than on intermittent treatment had grade 3 or worse haematological toxic effects (72 [15 %] vs 60 [12 %]), whereas nausea and vomiting were more common on intermittent treatment (11 [2 %] vs 43 [8 %]). Grade 3 or worse peripheral neuropathy (126 [27 %] vs 25 [5 %]) and hand-foot syndrome (21 [4 %] vs 15 [3 %]) were more frequent on continuous than on intermittent treatment. INTERPRETATION: Although this trial did not show non-inferiority of intermittent compared with continuous chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer in terms of overall survival, chemotherapy-free intervals remain a treatment option for some patients with advanced colorectal cancer, offering reduced time on chemotherapy, reduced cumulative toxic effects, and improved quality of life. Subgroup analyses suggest that patients with normal baseline platelet counts could gain the benefits of intermittent chemotherapy without detriment in survival, whereas those with raised baseline platelet counts have impaired survival and quality of life with intermittent chemotherapy and should not receive a treatment break.

Median survival in the ITT population (n= 815 in both groups) was 15 · 8 months (IQR 9 · 4 – 26 · 1) in arm A and 14 · 4 months (8 · 0 – 24 · 7) in arm C (hazard ratio [HR] 1 · 084, 80 % CI 1 · 008 – 1 · 165). In the per-protocol population (arm A, n= 467; arm C, n= 511), median survival was 19 · 6 months (13 · 0 – 28 · 1) in arm A and 18 · 0 months (12 · 1 – 29 · 3) in arm C (HR 1 · 087, 0 · 986 – 1 · 198). The upper limits of CIs for HRs in both analyses were greater than the predefined non-inferiority boundary. Preplanned subgroup analyses in the per-protocol population showed that a raised baseline platelet count, defined as 400   000 per μL or higher (271 [28 %] of 978 patients), was associated with poor survival with intermittent chemotherapy: the HR for comparison of arm C and arm A in patients with a normal platelet count was 0 · 96 (95 % CI 0 · 80 – 1 · 15, p= 0 · 66), versus 1 · 54 (1 · 17 – 2 · 03, p= 0 · 0018) in patients with a raised platelet count (p= 0 · 0027 for interaction). In the per-protocol population, more patients on continuous than on intermittent treatment had grade 3 or worse haematological toxic effects (72 [15 %] vs 60 [12 %]), whereas nausea and vomiting were more common on intermittent treatment (11 [2 %] vs 43 [8 %]). Grade 3 or worse peripheral neuropathy (126 [27 %] vs 25 [5 %]) and hand–foot syndrome (21 [4 %] vs 15 [3 %]) were more frequent on continuous than on intermittent treatment. InterpretationAlthough this trial did not show non-inferiority of intermittent compared with continuous chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer in terms of overall survival, chemotherapy-free intervals remain a treatment option for some patients with advanced colorectal cancer, offering reduced time on chemotherapy, reduced cumulative toxic effects, and improved quality of life. Subgroup analyses suggest that patients with normal baseline platelet counts could gain the benefits of intermittent chemotherapy without detriment in survival, whereas those with raised baseline platelet counts have impaired survival and quality of life with intermittent chemotherapy and should not receive a treatment break.

40|$|There {{are various}} types of patient {{mobility}}, but {{in the area of}} dental care {{the most common type of}} mobility is “self-managed” mobility, where patients decide themselves to seek treatment abroad. This decision is not normally based on lack of availability of treatment in the home State. Rather the decision is made in relation to the extent of the patient’s own financial contribution to the treatment. Even in countries with national health programs such as Western Europe, dental care is not always covered making it too expensive. As a consequence, countries with a lower cost of living and less expensive overheads become attractive destinations for cheaper dental treatment. Dental patients may combine their cheaper dental <b>treatment</b> with a <b>holiday,</b> thanks also to the increasing availability of low-cost air travel. When combined with a holiday, as the name implies, dental tourism can be an opportunity to receive low-cost, quality dental care. Dental tourism is expected to continue growing, as consumers continue to seek out lower-cost options. Today, much of the debate about dental tourism in general refers on the question of dental treatment i. e. whether or not differences in price imply quality difference. Another concern is whether or not large scale dental procedures can be safely completed abroad in a relatively short, "holiday-sized" time period. This initiates the issue of symbol that will help the public to recognize that “dental tourism” offers are safe, efficient and that advertising claims made have been substantiated by the protocols undertaken to achieve the Seal of Approval. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Infectious {{diseases}} are usually treatable; however, infectious disease {{is one of}} the most common causes of mortality in hospitals. Furthermore, an apparent functional stagnation around the weekends in hospitals can increase the mortality rate. The goal of this study is to describe the causes and predisposing factors of mortality and to evaluate the role of holidays on patient mortality in infectious disease wards. Methods: In this retrospective descriptive-analytic study, we examined the files of patients who had expired while hospitalized in the infectious disease ward of Imam Khomeini Hospital from 2002 to 2004. All of the information was gathered from patient files and the mortality committee of Imam Khomeini Hospital. Patient mortality rates were determined for each year. Mortality rates for the various days of the week were estimated and compared for 2004. Results: The total number of patients included in this study was 3979. Of these, 216 cases had expired, 143 of whom were male (66 %). The common causes of mortality were sepsis (26 %) bacterial pneumonia (22 %) and tuberculosis (19 %). The mortality rates were 5. 08 %, 5. 31 % and 5. 84 % in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. In 2004, mortality rates were 9. 21 %, 10. 21 % and 4. 56 % for holidays, pre-holidays and other days of week, respectively. A significantly higher rate of mortality was observed for holidays and pre-holidays compared to the other days of week. (P value &lt; 0. 05). Conclusions: Fortunately, the mortality rate of 5. 43 % in this infectious disease ward was not high. Since sepsis, bacterial pneumonia and tuberculosis were the most common causes of mortality, extra care of patients with these diseases is necessary. As a result of the findings of this study, we recommend increasing expert hospital staff and improving the quality of diagnostic and <b>treatment</b> services during <b>holidays</b> and pre-holidays. &nbsp...|$|R
