Also, the National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation became the National Water Storage Authority, the Water Services Regulatory Board became the Water Services Regulatory Commission and the Water Services Trust Fund became the Water Sector <b>Trust</b> <b>Authority.</b> The Bill is meant as an improved version of the Water Act of 2002, rather than another fundamental reform of the sector. The bill - under discussion since 2012 - was finally passed by Parliament as The Water Bill, 2014 (Bill No. 7 of 2014) on July 7th, 2015.|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} with conventional networks, mobile ad hoc networks {{usually do not}} provide on-line access to <b>trusted</b> <b>authorities</b> or to centralized servers and they exhibit frequent partitioning due to link and node failures and to node mobility. For these reasons, traditional security solutions that require on-line <b>trusted</b> <b>authorities</b> or certificate repositories are not well suited for securing ad hoc networks. In this paper, we propose a fully self-organized public-key management system that allows users to generate their public-private key pairs, to issue certificates, and to perform authentication regardless of the network partitions and without any centralized services. Furthermore, our approach does not require any <b>trusted</b> <b>authority,</b> {{not even in the}} system initialization phase...|$|R

40|$|Identity-based {{decryption}} is {{an alternative}} to identity-based encryption, in which Alice encrypts a symmetric key for Bob under a <b>trusted</b> <b>authority’s</b> public key. Alice sends Bob the resulting ciphertext, which Bob can send to the <b>trusted</b> <b>authority.</b> The <b>trusted</b> <b>authority</b> provides Bob the symmetric key only upon verifying Bob’s identity. 1 Identity-Based Encryption Shamir introduced [7] the notion of identity-based encryption (IBE). In contrast to public-key encryption (PKE), a user of IBE {{does not have a}} distinct public key. Rather, the user’s identity serves the role of public key. The user’s private key is created by some <b>trusted</b> <b>authority.</b> Boneh and Franklin proposed a practical identity-based encryption scheme [3, 4]. Some of the advantages of identity-based encryption over public-key encryption are: Less initialization: Alice can encrypt messages to Bob even if Bob does not yet have a private key. So, unlike in PKE, Bob {{does not have to be}} initialized into the system, that is, he does not already need to have a public key. This is because, upon receipt of such an IBE ciphertext from Alice, Bob can, if he does not already have the private key needed for decryption, obtai...|$|R

40|$|We {{explored}} the moderating role of <b>trust</b> in <b>authorities</b> in {{the positive effect of}} procedural {{fairness of the}} tax office on voluntary compliance with tax authorities. Building on fairness heuristic theory, we predicted that particularly low <b>trust</b> in <b>authorities</b> makes people carefully attend to the fairness with which the tax office enacts procedures. This should result in positive procedural fairness effects on endorsement of norms prescribing taxpaying and, consequently, in voluntary tax compliance, particularly among citizens with low <b>trust</b> in <b>authorities.</b> Results from an experiment and a field study revealed converging support for these predictions. We conclude that high <b>trust</b> in <b>authorities</b> forms an important boundary condition to the effectiveness of procedural fairness as a tool to enhance tax compliance.

40|$|Abstract. Trust {{is often}} {{conveyed}} through delegation, or through recommendation. This makes the <b>trust</b> <b>authorities,</b> who process and publish the trust recommendations, into an attractive target for attacks and spoofing. In some recent empiric studies, this {{was shown to}} lead to a remarkable phenomenon of adverse selection: a greater percentage of unreliable or malicious web merchants were found among those with certain types of trust certificates, then among those without. While such findings can be attributed to a lack of diligence in <b>trust</b> <b>authorities,</b> or even to conflicts of interest, our analysis of trust dynamics suggests that the public trust networks would probably remain vulnerable even if the <b>trust</b> <b>authorities</b> were perfectly diligent. The reason is that the main processes of trust building, under reasonable modeling assumptions, naturally lead to power-law distributions of trust: the rich get richer, the trusted attract more trust. The evolutionary processes governed by such distributions, ubiquitous in nature, are known to be robust with respect to random failures, but vulnerable to adaptive attacks. We recommend some ways to decrease this vulnerability, and suggest some ideas for exploration. ...|$|R

40|$|Security of {{computer}} networks normally {{relies on a}} <b>trusted</b> <b>authority</b> {{who is responsible for}} setting up the system and distributing cryptographic keys. If the <b>trusted</b> <b>authority</b> is compromised due to an attack, then the security of the entire system will be compromised. In this paper, we will look into this issue in terms of identity-based (or ID-based) cryptography. Since the introduction of identity-based (or ID-based) cryptography in 1984 by Shamir, IDbased cryptography has attracted many research due to its simplicity. However, ID-based cryptography suffers from several drawbacks, namely the requirement of having a secure channel during the key extraction and a complete trust to be placed on a <b>trusted</b> <b>authority</b> (or a so-called Private Key Generator PKG). In this paper, we overcome these problems by proposing a new key extraction algorithm that does not have these two limitations. We are only concentrating on the key extraction problem and hence, our schemes are applicable in any other ID-based scheme that has similar structure, such as Boneh-Franklin ID-based encryption scheme, etc...|$|R

30|$|High <b>trust</b> in <b>authorities</b> reduces {{perceived}} risk (and {{may even}} lead occupants to underestimate a hazard in unprotected areas), whereas low trust (or distrust) increases perceived risk (Wachinger et al. 2012). The authors further note that <b>trust</b> in <b>authorities</b> {{can be understood}} as a heuristic supporting decision-making in complex situations and when facing unknown or ambiguous threats. <b>Trust</b> in <b>authorities,</b> similar to credibility of information (see above), may also mediate the path between perceived risk and protective actions. Furthermore the authors hypothesize that damaging trust may increase perceived risk (Wachinger et al. 2012). Another hypothetical scenario study found a correlation between the degree of <b>trust</b> in <b>authorities</b> and hazard appraisals for certain technological risks (Siegrist and Cvetkovich 2000). As most of the research on <b>trust</b> in <b>authorities</b> and RP focusses on evacuation from natural disasters, further research with regard to fire evacuation is necessary.|$|R
