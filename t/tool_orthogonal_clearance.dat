40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{conventional}} drilling process and a circular milling process are compared {{with respect to}} delamination and fiber protrusion when machining carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP). The tool design (<b>tool</b> <b>orthogonal</b> <b>clearance,</b> drill-point angle) and the parameters (feed rate, cutting speed) are varied when drilling. The axial feed force and the spiral angles of the cutting edges can cause damages to the CFRP when circular milling. In this study, the possibilities to reduce those errors by the application of end mills with no spiral {{angle at the circumference}} cutter and no feed in axial direction are investigated. This milling process requires pre-drilled holes, and the final rivet hole dimension is then machined by circled movements without any motion in axial direction. For this special circular milling process, the tool design (rake angle of the circumference cutters) as well as the setting parameters (depth of cut, feed rate, cutting speed, up and down milling) are varied. The machining quality of both processes is compared. This is done by measuring the delaminations using an optical microscope. The fiber protrusion are visually identified {{with the help of an}} adapted imageprocessing algorithm. The diameters of the rivet holes are measured on two planes of the hole by a coordinate measuring machine. The cylindricity of the holes is determined using an instrument for roundness measurement...|$|E

Extracted initial camera parameters values are closer to the refined ones, which should generally assure faster and safer convergence during the refinement procedure.

40|$|A {{very common}} and {{effective}} approach for 3 D reconstruction is a camera based system where 3 D information is extracted from images. Different systems involve different camera calibration methods/tools. Characteristically for many systems is to calibrate the cameras using a single wand of known length. As {{integral part of}} the calibration procedure, initial camera parameters are commonly computed by putting and imaging two or three orthogonal wands inside the working volume. This is usually followed by the second step: sweeping the working volume with a single wand of known length. This paper presents two alternative ways of initializing camera parameters using essentially the same calibration <b>tools</b> (<b>orthogonal</b> wands), however by sweeping the volume with an orthogonal pair or triad of wands instead of a single one. The proposed methods exploit the orthogonality of the used wands and familiar linear constraints to calculate the image of the so-called absolute conic (IAC).

Even without refinement, sometimes not necessary, reconstruction results using our initial sets are better than using commonly obtained initial values.

30|$|Product {{structure}} can be optimized {{by using}} freeform surfaces, which {{opens the door}} for solutions with improved performance, reduced complexity, lower mass, and smaller size. However, due to the geometric particularity, freeform surfaces face more challenges and difficulties in precision manufacturing. Polishing is usually one of the final processing steps of precision manufacturing, and the results directly affect the appearance and longevity of parts [1]. It is fundamentally different from other precision manufacturing technologies. Removal of polishing does not only depend on the position of the <b>tool</b> <b>orthogonal</b> to the workpiece, as for grinding and cutting processes but also proportional to the product of local pressure and relative-speed between tool and workpiece and the dwell time. In recent years, there were efforts to develop versatile polishing processes in order to achieve high accuracy. The current polishing methods mainly include electrochemical polishing [2], magnetorheological fluid polishing [3],[4], plasma polishing [5],[6], ultrasonic polishing [7],[8] and computer-controlled mechanical polishing [9],[10]. Nowadays, a lot of freeform components are still produced by final manual polishing. It not only heavily relies on the know-how and experience of technicians but also needs much attention for processing and testing. To achieve a given level of precision with high efficiency and reliability, process automation is clearly the way forward. As the computer-controlled mechanical polishing has high efficiency and can be controlled easily [11], it is the focus of this study. The mechanical polishing is a statistical ‘rubbing’ process that the microscopic loose-abrasive particles in the polishing liquid which is driven by high-speed rotational polishing tool could produce friction with the part surface. Protruding portions of the surface are removed to meet the roughness requirement. However, due to the various factors, the polishing process heavily relies on trial and experience, which leads to a slow development in the mechanical polishing process.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{quality of}} {{machined}} products is {{strongly related to}} the machining conditions especially the tool wear evolution. The latter {{is among the most}} important problems encountered by manufacturers. In fact, the complexity of dealing with tool wear is due to the diversity of its origins (abrasion, diffusion, adhesion…) and the limits of models to predict it. For that, the majority of studies were based on experimental works to find laws linking tool wear to several cutting conditions [1, 2]. These estimations are limited to specific cutting conditions far from the industrial context.
