5|$|Both sides {{thought that}} they had inflicted more damage than was the case. The U.S. claimed to have shot down 70 Japanese {{aircraft}}, {{even though there were}} only 42 aircraft in all. Actual Japanese losses—from all causes—in the engagement were 25 aircraft, with most of <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> of the lost aircraft not being recovered or rescued. The Japanese, for their part, mistakenly believed that they had heavily damaged two U.S. carriers, instead of just one. The U.S. lost six aircraft in the engagement, with most of <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> being rescued.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Crew</b> Management System {{software}} has {{a unique}} feature of booking <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> through SMS. It is sent to <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> through <b>the</b> central database to serve it a call.If <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> acknowledges <b>the</b> call by sending back an acknowledgment through SMS, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> is booked. This is done for those crews who reside farther than 7-8 km from <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> booking location, else a call boy is sent for the same.Thus the software facilitates faster crew booking.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Crew</b> Master {{can select}} a course from <b>the</b> <b>Crew's</b> members to {{represent}} <b>the</b> <b>Crew</b> on <b>the</b> Platinum <b>Crew</b> website.

Extra MAX Points will be given if the player beats the course creator's score.|$|R
5|$|As the {{performance}} of gliders improved in the 1960s, the concept of flying {{as far away as}} possible became unpopular with <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> who had to retrieve the gliders. Pilots now usually plan to fly around a course (called a task) via turn-points, returning to the starting point.|$|E
5|$|Below {{is likely}} only an {{incomplete}} record of claims submitted by German crews during Gisela. It {{is certain that}} some of <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> that did not return from the operation also would have filed claims for air victories.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to notification from Air Traffic Control, three ambulances from Perth were despatched {{in the direction}} of the crash site, known to be somewhere between Chidlow and York. The crash site was several miles from the road so the ambulance crews travelled eastwards all the way to York without sighting a fire. <b>The</b> <b>crews</b> were eventually guided back along the main road and then along a dirt road that enabled them to drive to within three or four miles of the crash site. <b>The</b> <b>crews</b> then took their first-aid boxes and set out on foot.|$|E
50|$|DJMax Technika 2 has a Crew Race system. A {{player can}} create a Crew by {{spending}} 10000 MAX Points.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>crew</b> {{compartment}} occupies <b>the</b> {{central and}} rear {{parts of the}} hull and is used for accommodating <b>the</b> <b>crew,</b> installing <b>the</b> assemblies required for operation of <b>the</b> <b>crew,</b> and placing various equipment, ammunition, and SPTA. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> compartment is divided into the driving compartment, fighting compartment, and troop compartment.|$|R
50|$|The first {{communication}} between Sochi approach controller and <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> {{took place at}} 21:10. At that moment the airplane was beyond the coverage area of the Sochi radar. Up until 21:17 the approach controller and <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> discussed <b>the</b> observed and forecast weather, {{and as a result}} <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> decided to return to Yerevan. At 21:26, after the decision had already been made, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> asked <b>the</b> controller about the latest observed weather. At 21:30 the controller informed <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> that visibility was 3600 m and the cloud ceiling 170 m. At 21:31 <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> decided to continue the flight to Sochi airport.|$|R
5|$|Oxford were pre-race favourites, {{and won the}} toss, electing {{to start}} the race from the Surrey station. They took an early lead and were nearly half a length up on Cambridge by the time <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> passed the Harrods Furniture Depository. The boats closed in on one another and umpire Harris was forced to issue a number of {{warnings}} to both coxes as <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> came close to clashing oars. The Light Blues pulled themselves back into contention around the Chiswick Reach and took the lead into Corney Reach. Oxford attempted to find a quicker racing line and were still in touch, but Cambridge inched away from them, passing the finishing post one-and-a-third lengths ahead {{in a time of}} 17 minutes 35 seconds.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>crews</b> {{found the}} {{aircraft}} difficult to fly, and its top speed was reduced significantly. Production {{was shut down}} after the pilots reports reached the Ministry of Aviation. However, a Chinese delegation was visiting Germany and they considered the He 111 A-0 fit for their needs and purchased seven machines.|$|E
5|$|Trials for <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> {{were held}} in December 2012. Oxford's trial boats raced at Henley and were named Quick and Easy while Cambridge's trials took place at Dorney Lake with boats named Gin and Tonic.|$|E
50|$|The term umpire-in-chief {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> chief, who is usually the most experienced umpire in a <b>crew.</b> At <b>the</b> major-league and high minor-league (Class AAA and AA) levels, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> chief acts as a liaison between the league office and <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> and has a supervisory role over other members of <b>the</b> <b>crew.</b>|$|R

Baskeyfield subsequently fired the guns alone before he too was killed. His body was not identified {{after the war and}} he has no known grave.|$|E
5|$|At 18:00 {{the first}} {{aircraft}} began to take-off. The first RAF aircraft over Germany were medium bomber variants of the de Havilland Mosquito. No. 8 Group RAF committed 89 to bomb Berlin and Würzburg. The Mosquitos marked {{the area with}} target indicators while 64 others dropped 59 tons of bombs. Six Mosquitos marked Würzburg which was then while 24 others each dropped a Blockbuster bomb in a concentrated area east of the river causing a large fire. None of <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> noticed any defence of the target.|$|E
5|$|By February 1918, <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> of Sankt Georg {{and several}} other {{warships}} grew weary {{of the war and}} the long periods of inactivity, which led to the Cattaro Mutiny. The mutiny was quickly suppressed, but Sankt Georg {{and several other}} ships were subsequently decommissioned. Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Sankt Georg was awarded as a war prize to Britain. In 1920, she was sold to Italian ship breakers and scrapped thereafter.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{could barely}} {{be controlled by}} the crew; an abnormal right aileron input was needed [...] to keep the aircraft on heading. Dorval Tower then suggested that <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> divert to Montréal–Mirabel International Airport. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> agreed. <b>The</b> fire intensified and <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> could see that fire was coming out from the engine nacelle. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> then conducted emergency checklist and configured the aircraft for landing.|$|R
5|$|Croatian forces adapted several Antonov An-2 biplanes to drop {{supplies}} by parachute on Vukovar. The aircraft also dropped improvised bombs made of fuel {{cans and}} boilers filled with explosive and metal bars. <b>The</b> <b>crews</b> used GPS to locate their targets, then pushed ordinance {{through the side}} door. One of the aircraft was shot down by an SA-6 missile, killing Marko Živković, {{the commander of the}} air unit.|$|E
5|$|Defections by {{units of}} the Greek Navy to the Venizelist factions {{provoked}} a Royalist purge of Venizelist officers and men from the Greek Navy. French Admiral Fournet, the Commander in Chief of the Allied Squadron, perceived the Greek fleet as a menace to the Entente powers in the Aegean. He delivered an ultimatum to the Greeks to sequester the small ships and disable the large ones. On 19 October 1916, the breech blocks, munitions, and torpedoes were removed from Limnos and Kilkis. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> were reduced to one-third of normal size.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the safer}} eastern channel and {{improvements}} in maritime technology, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution still deals with incidents at the Doom Bar. In February 1997, two fishermen who were not wearing lifejackets drowned after their boat capsized. Two anglers {{had been killed in}} a similar incident in 1994. On 25 June 2007, the Padstow lifeboat and a rescue helicopter rescued <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> of two yachts in separate incidents from the area.|$|E

If the player defeats all four <b>crew</b> members, <b>the</b> player {{will have access to}} challenge <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> leader personally. If the player defeats <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> leader three times, the player is declared as having officially beaten <b>the</b> <b>crew,</b> and can progress to the next tier, if available, in conjunction with an exceptionally large payout. As well, an interaction between crew leaders is showcased, with <b>the</b> former <b>crew</b> leader challenging <b>the</b> player to a High Stakes Challenge.|$|R
5|$|Her {{tenure in}} Pola was enlivened by {{a visit from}} the new Emperor Karl I on 15 December 1916 and another by Kaiser Wilhelm on 12 December 1917 during his {{inspection}} of the German submarine base there. The Italians conducted no fewer than eighty air raids on Pola between 1915 and 1917 which undoubtedly kept <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> of her anti-aircraft guns busy.|$|E
5|$|In April 1919, {{while helping}} to defend Sevastopol from the {{advancing}} Bolsheviks, <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> of France and Jean Bart mutinied, but collapsed when Vice-Admiral Jean-Françoise-Charles Amet {{agreed to meet}} their main demand to take the ships home. 26 crewmen on France and three on Jean Bart were sentenced to prison terms upon her return, although they were commuted in 1922 {{as part of a}} bargain between Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré and the parties of the Left.|$|E
5|$|In May 1970, <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> of two Cuban {{fishing boats}} were kidnapped by Florida-based {{dissident}} group Alpha 66, who demanded that Cuba release imprisoned militants.
