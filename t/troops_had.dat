5|$|The American <b>troops</b> <b>had</b> {{signed up}} to capture Louisbourg, and {{expected}} to go home after siege ended. The British government, who had believed that the provincial troops were incapable of capturing Louisbourg on their own, had made no plans to send British troops to take over occupation of the fortress. When it become evident that British troops would not be relieving the provincials until after winter had passed, Governor Shirley travelled to Louisbourg to raise {{the morale of the}} troops. His first speech to the <b>troops</b> <b>had</b> little effect, and some troops were close to mutiny. In a second speech Shirley promised to send home more troops immediately, and provide higher pay and better supplies for those who stayed until spring. Honors from the British government were sparse; Pepperrell was made a baronet, he and Shirley were made colonels in the British Army with the right to raise their own regiments, and Warren was promoted to rear admiral.|$|E

5|$|The {{losses at}} Fort Lee and Washington placed a heavy {{toll on the}} Patriots. When they {{evacuated}} their forts, {{they were forced to}} leave behind critical supplies and munitions.

5|$|Although the {{military}} conflict essentially {{ended with the}} 1764 expeditions, Native Americans still called for resistance in the Illinois Country, where British <b>troops</b> <b>had</b> yet to take possession of Fort de Chartres from the French.

While they were doing this, Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat. At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan. All 9,000 <b>troops</b> <b>had</b> been evacuated with no loss of life.|$|E
5|$|At 03:35, the 6th Airborne Division {{headquarters}} landed by glider in the landing-zone {{cleared by}} sappers. Only a few gliders missed the landing-zone, {{due to the}} poor weather and errors in navigation.
