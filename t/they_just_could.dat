The Slovenian women joined the protest. Strikes were unheard of in the concentration camps, so this would lead to severe punishments.

The chief Gestapo agent Willy Bach came down from the headquarters in Dachau and tried to find the instigators, but no one came forward. In the end, Mary Vaders, who had arrived from Ravensbrück on October 15, 1944, was selected at random and incarcerated in the Dachau bunker cell for seven weeks of solitary confinement. She came back damaged but unbroken. The remaining Dutch and Slovenian women were punished with hours standing in formation in the court yard.|$|E

Tickertape Parade showcased for a few major record labels however could not ink a deal. After 2003, the band released a self-titled LP, featuring Nate Ruess from The Format, on Jim Adkin's (of Jimmy Eat World) short-lived label, Western Tread Recordings. Although the band was being shopped by numerous major and indie labels, the band could not seem to ink a deal, other than a lucrative Australian record deal that fell through. It seems the bands attorney, Mike McCoy (Fueled by Ramen, Fallout Boy), and Managers, Mike G and Scott McCracken (Lakeview Entertainment) seemed to lose interest in the band and jumped ship. Although the band had heavy weights such as Nate Rouse and Jim Adkins helping them succeed, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not make it happen. This, however, {{appears to be the}} last that anyone would hear from the band. In addition, it is also interesting to note that, although they were a top seller, they were essentially [...] "excommunicated" [...] from the Sunset Alliance Catalog, as its original catalog number, ALLY020, has been replaced by two other Sunset Alliance releases, and the label's website makes no mention of the band.|$|E

50|$|One-day off {{exactly a}} year since Dave Jones took charge in his first full game at Sheffield Wednesday (the 4-1 win against Bury), the Owls faced an away game against third in the league Watford - who were inevitably in good form. However, before this game the Sheffield Wednesday U-21 squad were due to play the Leeds United U-21 squad at Hillsborough, the game was {{confirmed}} to have been postponed at around 5 o'clock that afternoon in most extraordinary circumstances, as police had found an unexploded bomb just outside the ground. At 19:45 later that evening Sheffield Wednesday did kick-off against Watford at Vicarage Road. The first ten-minutes of the game started as the whole game {{was expected to be}} like, when looking at the league tables, with Watford having plenty of the ball and attacking Sheffield Wednesday consistently. Troy Deeney had his shot go just wide of the post, before the best chance of the game at this point fell to Matěj Vydra whose effort hit the outside of the post. Then, {{at the other end of}} the pitch, Jérémy Hélan's troublesome dribbling and pace saw him worry the defence into making a back pass, where Watford goalkeeper Jonathan Bond made a mistake, which led to Michail Antonio giving the Owls the lead, scoring from a tight angle. After the goal Sheffield Wednesday were by far the better team and arguably should have been at least three or four goals up by half-time. A great free-kick by Miguel Llera saw Jonathan Bond make a fabulous save right in the top corner of the goal, this save saw a header from Lewis Buxton just cleared-off the line by an opposition defender as Anthony Gardner tried to put the ball home as well. However, replays show that Lewis Buxton's header on rout to goal was handled by a Watford defender, trying to stop the ball from going into the net, and the ball that was then cleared off the line by another defender had actually crossed the line after all, therefore Sheffield Wednesday should have either been given a penalty and Watford down to ten-men, or Sheffield Wednesday should be two-goals up. After this incident, superb play by Jérémy Hélan once more, saw his volley finely saved by the goalkeeper, and Kieran Lee's effort somehow go wide of the goal, with it looking easier for ball to put into the back of the net. Wednesday went on to have a few half chances before the break, but so did Watford as Chris Kirkland made one fine save. Half-time was called and although a good lead for Sheffield Wednesday, they really should have been leading by more. The second-half started like the first with Watford on top and a corner they had was flicked on at the near post and met by substitute Fernando Forestieri who tapped home the equaliser. The Owls felt really hard done by, and Watford were now the team with the ascendancy and the home crowd right behind them. Watford continued to pressurise and good work by Fernando Forestieri just outside the area saw his shot miss three or four players before somehow finding the back of the net. Watford had turned the game on its head. Both sides had reasonable half-chances before the end of the game, and although Sheffield Wednesday gave it everything for the equaliser <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not get it. The game finished in a 2-1 defeat and Watford moved up to second, while Sheffield Wednesday went just two-points adrift of the relegation zone, with more very tough games coming up - fifth placed Leicester City were next before heading back home to face top of the league Cardiff City. So the second-game of the week saw the Owls travelling to play Leicester City. Both teams started the game lively and it was Leicester who had the first opportunity of the game when a clever volley from David Nugent forced Chris Kirkland into making a good save. Then at the other end of the pitch Michail Antonio managed to beat his man and send a fantastic cross over to the far post where Leroy Lita somehow managed to head the ball over the bar. Ritchie De Laet managed to beat his man later on in the game and forced another great save from Kirkland when he powered a shot towards goal. It remained goalless at half-time and Leicester had the first major opportunity in the second-half when a cross in the box saw Harry Kane head over the bar, when the player seemingly should have at least got the header on target. At the other end of pitch Lita sent a fine through-ball to Michail Antonio whose one-on-one effort was saved by Kasper Schmeichel. As the game remained very even with equally as good chances falling to both teams it was with twenty-minutes to go when Lewis Buxton sent in a cross, Michail Antonio flicked on and a volley by loanee Connor Wickham gave Sheffield Wednesday a vital lead. As the clock ticked on towards full-time a Leicester City corner saw Andy King's header hit the outside of the post and go wide. Fortunately for the Owls it was the last piece of major action in the game and Sheffield Wednesday gained a vital victory on the road to safety.|$|E

40|$|Spider monkeys (Ateles sp.) {{are common}} in zoological parks, but rare in {{scientific}} publications. Studies on tool use in primates have mostly focused on impressive tool users such as chimpanzees. Spider monkeys fulfill several criteria that {{are known to be}} associated with tool use. To be able to give an appropriate environment and enrichment for spider monkeys in captivity more knowledge is needed about their cognitive abilities. In this study we wanted to see if five male spider monkeys kept in a zoo could learn to use tools to reach a reward. Experiment 1 examined the subjects’ ability to learn to use a stick-tool to extract honey from a tube and experiment 2 their ability to learn to use a rake-tool to reach a reward. Each experiment consisted of three parts; A – monkeys got tools and treat next to each other; B – monkeys were shown how to use tool to get treat by a keeper and then got tools and treats next to each other; C – monkeys got tools and treats so <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> pull out the tool and get the treat. In both experiments at least two different spider monkeys succeeded with the zero-order manipulation task to pull out the tool and get treat in part C. Longer studies need to be conducted {{to be able to say}} if spider monkeys are able to learn a more complex tool using behavior as needed in part A and B...|$|E
