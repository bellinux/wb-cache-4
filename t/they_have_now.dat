5|$|Imaginative spectators {{would climb}} {{the church and}} watch a {{football}} game from the rooftop however <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> been deterred from doing so with the installation of security measures such as barbed wire and anti-climb paint. In addition, {{the introduction of the}} 'all-seater' ruling following the Taylor Report has meant that spectators no longer resort to climbing nearby buildings for a glimpse of the event as a seat is guaranteed with a purchased ticket.|$|E
5|$|The current {{name was}} given in 1354 AD, as Hisar-e-Firoza by Firuz Shah Tughlaq, the Sultan of Delhi from 1351 to 1388. The Ghaggar and Drishadvati Rivers once flowed through the city, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> changed their course. Hisar has a {{continental}} climate, with very hot summers and relatively cool winters. The most commonly spoken languages are Hindi, Haryanvi, and Bagri.|$|E
5|$|The {{reintroduction}} effort off the Oregon coast was not successful. However, reintroductions in 1969 and 1970 off the Washington coast {{were very}} successful and sea otters have been expanding their range since. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> entered the Strait of Juan de Fuca {{and can be}} found almost as far east as Pillar Point. Individuals have even been seen in the San Juan Islands and northern Puget Sound.|$|E

5|$|During the Victorian {{expansion}} of Manchester, Didsbury {{developed as a}} prosperous settlement; a few mansions from the period still exist on Wilmslow Road between Didsbury village and Parrs Wood {{to the east and}} Withington to the north, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> been converted to nursing homes and offices. The opening of the Midland Railway line in 1880 contributed greatly to the rapid growth in the population of Didsbury, with stations at Didsbury and Withington and West Didsbury offering easy rail connections to Manchester Central. The line closed in 1967, although Didsbury station building remained standing until its demolition in the 1980s. The station clock and water fountain have survived, dedicated to local doctor and campaigner for the poor, Dr. J. Milson Rhodes.|$|E
5|$|Initially, as {{in some of}} the {{continental}} cathedrals, the interior was decorated with designs emphasizing the arch ribs and portal components. Even the brick was painted with red and white stripes. In the 15th century, frescos of figures in the Late Gothic style with decorative vine leaves were painted {{in various parts of the}} church. Traces of these have been found in the chancel and in the chapel which was originally dedicated to St Eric and St Olaf. Unfortunately, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> been heavily restored. The frescos in the chancel were probably painted by Albertus Pictor's workshop.|$|E
5|$|I {{had settled}} {{an affair with}} five gentlemen of that country who were each of them to raise a {{regiment}} of dragoons well mounted and well armed which I knew they could easily do for the men had horses and homes of their own, and were, to say the truth most of them, the persons who some time since robbed the late Bishop of Winchester's Park, and have increased in their number ever since. They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a most loyal little town...I once saw two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile of my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there is no less than a thousand of them and indeed I believe <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.|$|E

5|$|Teenager Billy Duncan {{wakes up}} in his bed, {{seemingly}} disturbed, and learns his mother is leaving for vacation. He goes to visit his girlfriend Kathy, but her deranged grandfather Colonel Farley makes him leave before he can see her. As Billy drives around town, he is harassed by bullies Chuck Boran and Froggy, and by two police deputies who give him a speeding ticket. Billy wanders into the desert and discovers the laser cannon and pendant. He starts playing with the cannon, pretending to shoot things, then realizes he can fire the weapon while wearing the pendant. Meanwhile, on the alien spacecraft, the two aliens converse with their leader who shows them footage of Billy using the cannon, prompting the aliens to turn their ship around {{to head back to}} Earth. Context implies that the two aliens, upon departing Earth, left the cannon and pendant behind under the presumption that no other human would be able to use them as the green-skinned man had, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> learned that they were in error.|$|E
25|$|Hedge {{funds have}} existed {{for many decades}} and have become {{increasingly}} popular. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> grown to be a substantial fraction of asset management, with assets now totaling around $3 trillion.|$|E

60|$|The man winced, {{and it was}} {{fortunate}} that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>now</b> left the light behind and his mother could not see his face.|$|R
25|$|Not {{only did}} Indianapolis improve to 13–2 with the win but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> won 10 {{straight}} home games against division opponents. The Colts {{will face the}} Tennessee Titans in the week 17 season finale on NBC Sunday Night Football.|$|E
25|$|Chlorofluorocarbons {{were used}} almost universally as {{refrigerants}} and propellants {{due to their}} relatively low toxicity and high heat of vaporization. Starting in the 1980s, as their contribution to ozone depletion became known, their use was increasingly restricted, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> largely been replaced by HFCs.|$|E
25|$|Air {{pollution}} and acid rain have damaged the marble and stonework. The last remaining slabs {{from the western}} section of the Parthenon frieze {{were removed from the}} monument in 1993 for fear of further damage. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> been transported to the New Acropolis Museum.|$|E
60|$|In another second curiosity had {{overcome}} fear, {{and the men}} advanced slowly. Apparently <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>now</b> forgotten their amiable {{intention of}} killing us.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>now</b> {{been three}} weeks out, but had made slow progress, for the winds had been light, and {{mostly from the}} southwest.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>now</b> come round {{nearly to}} the house, and she showed, by the {{direction}} that she took, {{that she was going}} in.|$|R
25|$|The Australian Army {{did not use}} CVR(T)s, but did use the Scorpion turret {{mounted on}} top of M113 armored {{personnel}} carriers. Known in the Australian Army as the Medium Reconnaissance Vehicle, they were used in a fire support role. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> been replaced by newer vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{characters}} {{sharing the}} same phonetic had similar readings, though <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> diverged substantially. Linguists rely heavily on this fact to reconstruct the sounds of Old Chinese. Contemporary foreign pronunciations of characters are also used to reconstruct historical Chinese pronunciation, chiefly that of Middle Chinese.|$|E
25|$|Tooth wear may {{be brought}} to the person's {{attention}} during routine dental examination. With awake bruxism, most people will often initially deny clenching and grinding because they are unaware of the habit. Often, the person may re-attend soon after the first visit and report that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> become aware of such a habit.|$|E

25|$|Two of {{the forests}} in the {{surrounding}} area, Gribskov and Store Dyrehave were developed in the 1680s under King Christian V for par force hunting with a mathematically designed system of access roads. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> {{been included in the}} UNESCO World Heritage List under Par force hunting landscape in North Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Early 1990s: Car parking {{was much}} {{expanded}} eastwards across Shadow Moss, and obliterated Heyhead (a group of old houses and a shop and a chapel) despite a protest group. Two old cottages were {{left on the}} north side of the west end of the old Ringway Road due to preservation orders, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> disappeared.|$|E
25|$|The {{temple was}} gutted and {{partially}} {{destroyed in the}} 1960s and the bronze statue disappeared. In 1983 {{the lower part of}} it was said to have been found in a Lhasa rubbish tip, and the upper half in Beijing. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> been joined and the statue is housed in the Ramoche Temple, which was partially restored in 1986, and still showed severe damage in 1993.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>now</b> ascended a small rising ground, {{which gave}} the wide {{prospect}} over the plain. Iskander halted and threw an anxious glance around him.|$|R
