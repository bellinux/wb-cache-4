6000|$|The {{officer said}} to Mark {{at the end}} of two months: [...] "These knights of the road don't often mix {{themselves}} up with the London housebreakers. The most likely men to be able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> doings of such a fellow would be receivers of stolen goods, but it would be dangerous to question any of them--they would be sure to put him on his guard. I will give you a list of some of them, and I should say that your best way would be to watch their places of an evening, from the time it gets dark till ten or eleven. Of course, it is just a chance. You may watch one place for a month and he may happen to go there the very day you have gone off to watch another crib. Still, there is just the chance, and I don't see that there is one any other way." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{it is not}} {{on these}} points that I wish to dwell this afternoon. I want <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> meaning {{and the spirit of}} the Budget. Upon the Budget and upon the policy of the Budget depends a {{far-reaching}} plan of social organisation designed to give a greater measure of security to all classes, but particularly to the labouring classes. In the centre of that plan stands the policy of national insurance. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has been {{for more than a year}} at work upon this scheme, and it is proposed--I hope next year, if there is a next year--it is proposed, working through the great friendly societies, which have done so much invaluable work on these lines, to make sure that, by the aid of a substantial subvention from the State, even the poorest steady worker or the poorest family shall be enabled to make provision against sickness, against invalidity, and for the widows and orphans who may be left behind.|$|E
6000|$|L. My dear, {{it means}} simply {{that you are}} to go the road which you see to be the {{straight}} one; carrying whatever you find is given you to carry, as well and stoutly as you can; without making faces, or calling people to come and look at you. Above all, you are neither to load, nor unload, yourself; nor cut your cross to your own liking. Some people {{think it would be}} better for them to have it large; and many, that they could carry it much faster if it were small; and even those who like it largest are usually very particular about its being ornamental, and made of the best ebony. But all that you have really to do is to keep your back as straight as you can; and not think about what is upon it--above all, not to boast of what is upon it. The real and essential meaning of [...] "virtue" [...] is in that straightness of back. Yes; you may laugh, children, but it is. You know I was <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> words that began with V. Sibyl, what does [...] "virtue" [...] mean literally? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now for the grebes {{lowering}} {{themselves in}} water, (which Lucy said I was <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about).</b> <b>The</b> {{way in which}} they manage it, I believe to be this. Most birds have under their skins great air-passages which open into the lungs, and which, when the bird is moving quickly, and consequently devouring a great deal of air, do, to a certain extent, the work of supplementary lungs. They also lessen the bird's specific gravity, which must be of some help in flying. And in the gannet, which drops into the sea from a great height after fish, these air-bags lessen the shock on striking the water. Now the grebes (and all diving-birds) which can swim high up out of water when the air-cushions are full, and so feel very little the cold of the water beneath them, breathe out all spare air, and sink almost out of sight when they wish to be less conspicuous;--just as a balloon sinks when part of the gas is let out. And I have often watched the common divers and cormorants too, when frightened, swimming about with only head and neck out of water, and so looking more like snakes than birds.|$|E

50|$|In a biographical note on Robert Combas’ {{official}} website the artist asserts his aim is to“provoke, that is, {{to trigger a}} reaction in the spectator only to ‘invite’ him, beckoning him in and whispering in his ear ‘come over and talk to me, I want <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> stupidity, violence, beauty, love, hatred, seriousness and fun, the logic and senselessness that pervade our day-to-day lives’ ”.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interpretations of}} {{contemporary}} music by the Amar Quartet met with unanimous enthusiasm amongst composer and reviewers. Anton Webern wrote to Alban Berg {{from the music}} festival in Salzburg in 1922 about performances of his Movements for String Quartet, Op. 5 and Schönberg's F-sharp minor Quartet, Op. 10 as follows: «I don't need <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> incredible effect of the F-sharp minor Quartet. Or maybe I do: for {{it was a very}} rare event. The Hindemith Quartet played excellently. As far as my Quartet was concerned: performance (Hindemith) very good. Really played like music.»The Quartet attracted particular interest when they interpreted Hindemith's own works. A critic was both fascinated and amazed when he wrote the following in November 1927 after a concert in Zurich: «Hindemith writes for his viola, his quartet, so that they follow his lead, only that his viola part sometimes jerks through the ensemble like a snake and carries everything away with it. The result is that the artists can perform their pieces in a tempo that would make one dizzy without sacrificing a single note. For example, if the first movement of the ‹String Trio› (Op. 34) could be performed more modestly, it might be seen that the piece is actually quite pretty.» ...|$|E
