40|$|A ring is {{generally}} provided {{at the intersection}} between the cylinder and the cone of an elevated storage silo or tank to resist a large circumferential compressive force at the intersection (the transition junction).

A common cross-sectional form of this ringbeam is a T-section.

40|$|Silo and HDF 5 are I/O {{libraries}} {{used by many}} codes {{important to}} the LLNL's Weapons and Complex Integration (WCI) mission. In the past year, modest adjustments and tuning of Silo, HDF 5 and the I/O configuration of the BG/P platform, Dawn, were undertaken.

In particular, the application codes {{have been allowed to}} continue to use a simplified yet highly flexible I/O paradigm known as 'Poor Man's Parallel I/O', where scalability is achieved through concurrent, serial I/O to multiple files. The results demonstrate substantial performance gains (better than 50 x in many cases) at large scale (greater than 64, 000 MPI tasks).

30|$|In a {{very real}} sense, the primary {{challenge}} schools face in teaching STEM subjects in an integrated way is the most unique of all to the integrated STEM movement: schools continue to teach STEM subjects separately. This {{can be considered a}} superordinate challenge subsuming most of the others, since many of the various challenges and obstacles identified by participants were strongly related to the separate teaching of school subjects in schools. There may be little time in school schedules for planning and teaching integrated STEM until substantive changes in school organization and scheduling are made. As Moore and Smith (2014) state, “School change is needed to support STEM integration. Schools are set up <b>to</b> <b>silo</b> the STEM disciplines…Schools need to make structural changes that will allow students to…learn the nature of each of the STEM disciplines and learn that they are interconnected in ways that…they will encounter in real world problems” (p. 7). The extent to which administrators and teachers understand and expect meaningful reform in how the STEM subjects (if not all school subjects) are presently taught is an important issue as we continue to study the needs and challenges associated with K- 12 education in integrated STEM.|$|E

40|$|Rainfall intensity-frequency-duration (IFD) curves {{are often}} used by {{engineers}} and environmental modellers {{for the design of}} a wide range of hydraulic structures and for environmental studies. Current practice of deriving the IFD curves for any Australian location is based on the design criteria of the Australian Rainfall and Runoff (ARR). With the advancement of knowledge as reported in the literature, and extensive fine scale data availability, it is high time to review the ARR methodology. This paper presents a robust approach to the derivation of the IFD curves for any location in Australia. The new approach is based on stochastic disaggregation of daily rainfall data to any fine timescale. The disaggregation model incorporates repetition techniques and a proportional adjusting procedure into a regionalized hybrid model. A novel approach of the capping of the simulation time scale depths to improve the IFD curve estimation is presented. The disaggregation model is linked <b>to</b> <b>SILO</b> Data Drill Facility that generates long-term (1889 to date) daily rainfall data for any location within Australia.

40|$|Performance {{assessments}} of low-level radioactive waste (LLW) disposal facilities often involve {{the use of}} computer codes to describe radionuclide releases from a waste form and the subsequent transport of radionuclides through the environment. The SOURCE 1 and SOURCE 2 computer codes are used to calculate radionuclide release rates (i. e., source terms) for LLW disposal facilities. These codes {{have been used to}} evaluate the source terms for Oak Ridge National Laboratory performance assessments. SOURCE 1 is applicable to tumulus-type facilities, while SOURCE 2 can be applied <b>to</b> <b>silo,</b> well-in-silo, well, and trench-type facilities. In addition to the calculation of radionuclide release rates, both SOURCE 1 and SOURCE 2 calculate the degradation of engineered barriers. This paper provides an overview of these codes and a description of recent improvements to the codes. Major improvements include incorporation of a new advective transport model into SOURCE 1 and SOURCE 2, development of a new model for SOURCE 1 that calculates the degradation and failure of the tumulus pad and leachate collection system, improvement of routines for controlling water infiltration inputs, expansion of options for obtaining output summaries, and restructuring of SOURCE 1 and SOURCE 2 for sensitivity and uncertainty analyses.

40|$|Abstract:The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of particle size distribution on the mechanical properties of granular sulphur and its relation <b>to</b> <b>silo</b> blockage at South Pars Gas Complex Phases 2 & 3. Solid elemental sulphur is a relatively hard, friable crystalline material that tends to break up into smaller particles when subjected to force or stress of any magnitude. Conglomeration of the dust so produced clogs storage silos, making truck loading difficult. Grain size selection is based on the “friability value ” and “maximum entropy ” for granules in a static state. The model of the behavior of confined granular sulphur is based on the principle of continuum mechanics. Granules were formed by feeding liquid sulphur and water to a rotating granulation drum. Sample granules were classified into different size fractions (300 µm – 4. 75 mm) by sieve analysis, and friability tests were done by the Fines 28 -inch tumbler S 5 - 77 test. Friability and granule size data collected over four years were studied. The implication of field analysis and laboratory tests is that the granule size should be controlled during sulphur solidification while ensuring that only granular material with the correct mechanical characteristics is stored in the silo and shipped...|$|E
