40|$|The {{fact that}} {{promoters}} {{are essential for}} the function of all genes presents {{the basis of the}} general idea that retrotranspositions give rise to processed pseudogenes. However, recent studies have demonstrated that some retrotransposed genes are transcriptionally active. Because promoters are not thought to be retrotransposed along with exonic sequences, these transcriptionally active genes must have acquired a functional promoter by mechanisms that are yet to be determined. Hence, comparison between a retrotransposed gene and its source gene appears to provide a unique opportunity to investigate the promoter creation for a new gene. Here, we identified 29 gene pairs in the human genome, consisting of a functional retrotransposed gene and its parental gene, and compared their respective promoters. In more than half of these cases, we unexpectedly found that {{a large part of the}} core promoter had been <b>transcribed,</b> reverse <b>transcribed,</b> and then integrated to be operative at the transposed locus. This observation can be ascribed to the recent discovery that transcription start sites tend to be interspersed rather than situated at 1 specific site. This propensity could confer retrotransposability to promoters per se. Accordingly, the retrotransposability can explain the genesis of some alternative promoters...|$|R

Background Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that 9. 6 million people in the world suffer from. Indonesia is one of the world’s 22 high-burden countries with over 320. 000 cases of TB in 2014. The UN’s (United Nation) goal is to have ended the TB epidemics by the year 2030. Nurses {{play a central role in}} accomplishing adherence to treatment and prevention of TB. Method To fulfil the aim a qualitative method using semi-structured interviews was used. The interviews were recorded and <b>transcribed.</b> The <b>transcribed</b> data was analysed by using a qualitative content analysis with a manifest approach.

40|$|In eukaryotes, RNA {{polymerase}} (pol) I exclusively <b>transcribes</b> {{the large}} rRNA gene unit (rDNA) and mRNA is synthesized by RNA pol II. The African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, represents {{an exception to}} this rule. In this organism, transcription of genes encoding the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) and the pro-cyclins is resistant to -amanitin, indicating that it is mediated by RNA pol I, while other protein-coding genes are <b>transcribed</b> by RNA pol II. To obtain firm proof for this concept, we generated a T. brucei cell line which exclusively expresses protein C epitope-tagged RNA pol I. Using an anti-protein C immunoaffinity matrix, we specifically depleted RNA pol I from transcriptionally active cell extracts. The depletion of RNA pol I impaired in vitro transcription initiated at the rDNA promoter, the GPEET procyclin gene promoter, and a VSG gene expression site promoter but did not affect transcription from the spliced leader (SL) RNA gene promoter. Fittingly, induction of RNA interference against the RNA pol I largest subunit in insect-form trypanosomes significantly reduced the relative transcriptional efficiency of rDNA, procyclin genes, and VSG expression sites in vivo whereas that of SL RNA, -tubulin, and heat shock protein 70 genes was not affected. Our studies unequivocally show that T. brucei harbors a multifunctional RNA pol I which, in addition to <b>transcribing</b> rDNA, <b>transcribes</b> procyclin genes and VSG gene expression sites.

We utilized AFLPs and DNA sequences from cpDNA and nuclear internal <b>transcribed</b> spacer/external <b>transcribed</b> spacer regions to examine the hypothesis that sect.

40|$|SINEs are retrotransposons {{that have}} enjoyed {{remarkable}} reproductive success {{during the course}} of mammalian evolution, and have {{played a major role in}} shaping mammalian genomes. Previously, an analysis of survey-sequence data from an individual dog (a poodle) indicated that canine genomes harbor a high frequency of alleles that differ only by the absence or presence of a SINEC_Cf repeat. Comparison of this survey-sequence data with a draft genome sequence of a distinct dog (a boxer) has confirmed this prediction, and revealed the chromosomal coordinates for > 10, 000 loci that are bimorphic for SINEC_Cf insertions. Analysis of SINE insertion sites from the genomes of nine additional dogs indicates that 3 %- 5 % are absent from either the poodle or boxer genome sequences—suggesting that an additional 10, 000 bimorphic loci could be readily identified in the general dog population. We describe a methodology that can be used to identify these loci, and could be adapted to exploit these bimorphic loci for genotyping purposes. Approximately half of all annotated canine genes contain SINEC_Cf repeats, and these elements are occasionally <b>transcribed.</b> When <b>transcribed</b> in the antisense orientation, they provide splice acceptor sites that can result in incorporation of novel exons.

Methods: A qualitative study nested within a controlled trial {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a primary care epilepsy specialist nurse service in Bristol, UK. Twelve patients who had had at least one seizure in the previous year were purposively selected from the trial population for an in-depth interview. Interviews were audiotape recorded and <b>transcribed</b> verbatim. <b>Transcribed</b> text was methodically coded and themes were identified using the method of constant comparison. Results: Not all informants wanted to see the epilepsy nurse as they felt their epilepsy was well controlled and thus they did not see the need for care or attention. Those that chose to use the nurse service did so as they wanted information on epilepsy or better control of their seizures. The epilepsy nurse was able to provide them with the information they wanted but was not able to improve their seizure control. Informants felt able to communicate effectively with the nurse and they valued the information and advice received. They were unable to get this kind of communication and empathy from other clinicians. Informants generally praised the nurse service but were aware that it was unlikely to improve the control of their seizures. Most accepted this. Conclusions: Effective communication with clinicians is as much, if not more of a priority for patients with epilepsy, than is controlling the clinical manifestations of their condition...|$|R
40|$|Background Occupational {{therapy is}} not {{constrained}} by national boundaries. A central concept within the profession is that occupations are fundamental to human existence, which therefore implies that occupational therapy is a profession that {{can and should}} have a global perspective. Globalisation is becoming an increasing reality within health and social care. Universities must be responsive to this {{in the form of}} curriculum delivery. The internationalisation of the occupational therapy curriculum is essential so that students are prepared to work in an ever increasing globalised world. The need for occupational therapists to be knowledgeable about and open to views that may differ from their own, while also being able to interpret local problems within a wider and more global framework is essential. This requirement must be met first and foremost with the education of the future of the profession, occupational therapy students. Research on students’ views surrounding internationalisation of the curriculum is of the upmost important as they are the stakeholders who are primarily affected. Purpose This study aims to explore undergraduate occupational therapy students’ views on internationalisation of the curriculum. Method A qualitative methodology will be used to enable students to share their views. A phenomenological approach will allow for rich detailed views to emerge. A focus group will be conducted with ten participants. The participants will be 4 th year occupational therapy students at a specific university in Scotland. The focus group will be audio recorded, so that the verbatim may be <b>transcribed.</b> The <b>transcribed</b> data will then undergo inductive coding and thematic analysis.

The participants were selected purposively, and final year pre-service primary school English trainee teachers were used to collect the research data. The data were collected in the year 2016. To collect the data, an interview schedule, an observation guide and document analyses were used. The interviews and the observations were recorded and later <b>transcribed.</b> The <b>transcribed</b> data were coded, categorized according to their similarity, and then these categories were further collapsed into themes. The findings showed that the primary school ELT trainee teachers did not have sufficient understanding of the ELT methods offered during their training which led to poor practice, as revealed in their independent teaching. Some {{of the reasons for the}} trainees’ poor understanding and practice mentioned were that the training system was not supported by the reflective teaching method, and the support of ICT. In addition, there was a significant waste of time budgeted for the course time for the completion of the training program. In relation to time, the practicum time the students stayed in the primary school during independent teaching was not sufficient to give them hands-on practice. Moreover, they did not get the required support from the school mentors and the training college supervisors.

40|$|Most of the {{vertebrate}} genome is <b>transcribed</b> into RNA. <b>Transcribed</b> regions contain {{hundreds of}} thousands of potential duplex structures that could serve as substrates for RNAse III enzymes of microRNA (miRNA) maturation pathways. Yet, only a minority of these potential precursors {{make their way to the}} cytoplasm to form mature miRNAs. We question here what specific structural features make an RNA stem-loop structure an adequate primary or precursor miRNA. We address this question by comparing known pre-miRNAs to other predicted noncoding transcripts obtained from comparative genomics scans, using the structure comparison program RNAforester. By analyzing a classification tree of 1200 such RNA structures, we observe that pre-miRNAs cluster distinctly from other duplex structures of apparently similar size and free energy. The most distinctive features of nonprecursor duplexes are increased lengths and numbers of bulges and internal loops when compared to real miRNA precursors. Thanks to these characteristics, secondary structure comparison can predict the miRNA precursor status of a candidate stem-loop with a surprising accuracy. Furthermore, predicted noncoding transcripts tend to depart from miRNA precursor characteristics more strongly than randomly occurring duplex structures in genomic DNA. This result suggests that many noncoding RNAs may be under selection to dodge the RNAi pathway...|$|R
40|$|Nucleotide {{excision}} repair (NER) is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet irradiation and various chemical agents that cause bulky adducts. Two subpathways within NER remove {{damage from the}} genome overall or the <b>transcribed</b> strands of <b>transcribing</b> genes (TCR). TCR is a faster repair process than overall genomic repair and has been thought to require the RAD 26 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rad 26 {{is a member of}} the SWI/SNF family of proteins that either disrupt chromatin or facilitate interactions between the RNA Pol II and transcription activators. SWI/SNF proteins are required for the expression or repression of a diverse set of genes, many of which are differentially <b>transcribed</b> in response to particular carbon sources. The remodeling of chromatin by Rad 26 could affect transcription and/or TCR following formation of DNA damage and other stress-inducing conditions. We speculate that another factor(s) can substitute for Rad 26 under particular growth conditions. We therefore measured the level of repair and transcription in two different carbon sources and found that the defect in the rad 26 mutant for TCR was dependent on the type of carbon source. Furthermore, TCR did not correlate with transcription rate, suggesting that disruption of RAD 26 leads to a specific defect in DNA repair and not transcription...|$|R

Here, we have sampled the methylome by shallow sequencing of HSO (bisulfite) -treated DNA and have used these data to identify methylation patterns {{associated with high}} confidence gene models. We trained a classifier to predict functional gene models based on expression levels, methylation profiles, and sequence conservation. We have expanded the transcriptome atlas by sequencing RNA from meristematic tissues, florets, and embryos, and utilized this information to develop a more complete annotation of the sorghum transcriptome. Our gene annotations modify 60 % of Sbi 1. 4 (version 1. 4 of sorghum gene annotations) gene models. The updated models most often have extended untranslated region (UTR) annotations (18, 105), but some show longer protein coding regions (5096) or previously unannotated alternative transcripts (6493). A phylogenetic analysis suggests that 800 genes are missing from annotation Sbi 1. 4 and 400 gene models are split. The new annotations resolve 50 % of split gene models and include 30 % of conserved genes missing from the Sbi 1. 4 annotation. Using our classifier, we identified a large set of 34, 276 novel potentially functional <b>transcribed</b> regions.

Two sets of tRNA(1) (Gly) belonging to the extreme groups of highly <b>transcribed</b> and barely <b>transcribed</b> copies have been examined for their expression patterns in vivo in B. mori-derived cell lines following transfection. We have developed a sensitive and reliable method for directly quantifying the transcription levels of transfecting tRNA genes without relying on the biological activity of the transcript. The strategy involved the insertion of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide sequences into the coding region of the transfecting gene and monitoring the transcripts in an RNase protection assay using an antisense probe that clearly distinguished them from the endogenous tRNAs. The oligonucleotide insertion did not significantly affect the transcriptional status of the genes, even though {{the distance between the}} A and B boxes was enhanced by 10 - 15 nt. In vivo also the transcription of tRNA(1) (Gly) - 1 reached very high levels, whereas the transcripts arising from tRNA(1) (Gly) - 6 : 7 accounted for only 2 - 5 % of the former, closely resembling the transcription patterns in vitro. These individual gene copies having identical coding sequences and consequently the same internal conserved regions, differed only in their flanking sequences which modulate their transcription levels...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{regulatory}} networks {{control the}} transcription state of a genome. These transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) have been mathematically described using a Boolean formalism, {{in which the}} state of a gene is represented as either <b>transcribed</b> or not <b>transcribed</b> in response to regulatory signals. The Boolean formalism results in a series of regulatory rules for the individual genes of a TRN that in turn can be used to link environmental cues to the transcription state of a genome, thereby forming a complete transcriptional regulatory system (TRS). Herein, we develop a formalism that represents such a set of regulatory rules in a matrix form. Matrix formalism allows for the systemic characterization of the properties of a TRS and facilitates the computation of the transcriptional state of the genome under any given set of environmental conditions. Additionally, it provides a means to incorporate mechanistic detail of a TRS as it becomes available. In this study, the regulatory network matrix, R, for a prototypic TRS is characterized and the fundamental subspaces of this matrix are described. We illustrate how the matrix representation of a TRS coupled with its environment (R*) allows for a sampling of all possible expression states of a given network, and furthermore, how the fundamental subspaces of the matrix provide a way to study key TRS features and may assist in experimental design...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are small}} noncoding RNAs that direct posttranscriptional gene {{silencing}} in eukaryotes. They are frequently clustered in the genomes {{of animals and}} can be independently <b>transcribed</b> or simultaneously <b>transcribed</b> into single polycistronic transcripts. Only a few miRNA clusters have been described in plants, {{and most of them}} are generated from independent transcriptional units. Here, we used a combination of bioinformatic tools and experimental analyses to discover new polycistronic miRNAs in rice. A genome-wide analysis of clustering patterns of MIRNA loci in the rice genome was carried out using a criterion of 3 kb as the maximal distance between two miRNAs. This analysis revealed 28 loci with the ability to form the typical hairpin structure of miRNA precursors in which 2 or more mature miRNAs mapped along the same structure. RT-PCR provided evidence for the polycistronic nature of seven miRNA precursors containing homologous or nonhomologous miRNA species. Polycistronic miRNAs and candidate polycistronic miRNAs are located across different rice chromosomes, except chromosome 12, and resided in both duplicated and nonduplicated chromosomal regions. Finally, most polycistronic and candidate polycistronic miRNAs showed a pattern of conservation in the genome of rice species with an AA genome. The diversity in the organization of MIR genes that are <b>transcribed</b> as polycistrons suggests a versatile mechanism for the control of gene expression in different biological processes and supports additional levels of complexity in miRNA functioning in plants...|$|R
5000|$|The {{molecular}} basis of dominance was unknown to Mendel. It is now understood that a gene locus includes {{a long series}} (hundreds to thousands) of bases or nucleotides of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at a particular point on a chromosome. The central dogma of molecular biology states that [...] "DNA makes RNA makes protein", that is, that DNA is <b>transcribed</b> to make an RNA copy, and RNA is translated to make a protein. In this process, different alleles at a locus {{may or may not}} be <b>transcribed,</b> and if <b>transcribed</b> may be translated to slightly different versions of the same protein (called isoforms). Proteins often function as enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions in the cell, which directly or indirectly produce phenotypes. In any diploid organism, the DNA sequences of the two alleles present at any gene locus may be identical (homozygous) or different (heterozygous). Even if the gene locus is heterozygous at the level of the DNA sequence, the proteins made by each allele may be identical. In the absence of any difference between the protein products, neither allele can be said to be dominant (see co-dominance, above). Even if the two protein products are slightly different (allozymes), it is likely that they produce the same phenotype with respect to enzyme action, and again neither allele can be said to be dominant.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{understand}} the multicultural teaching experiences of music teachers in the Fayetteville and Springdale public school districts {{through the lens of}} James Banks 2 ̆ 7 four approaches to curriculum reform. The research was intended to add to the limited literature presently found on the definition of multicultural music education and how this type of education is implemented. The study also increased knowledge of teacher motives for implementing multicultural education in the music classroom and highlight challenges that lie within implementation. Purposive sampling was used and in an attempt to get an information rich sample, two schools were chosen from the Fayetteville school district and six schools were chosen from the Springdale school district. A qualitative approach was used for this study. The participants were interviewed using a semi-structured set of questions and one classroom observation followed the initial interviews. The data of the interviews and observations was <b>transcribed.</b> The <b>transcribed,</b> raw data of interviews and lesson observations of each teacher was read several times and themes were identified based on the research questions using the data reduction method. The findings of the study produced a definition for multicultural music education orginating from the definitions of Banks, Carolin, and the definitions of those who participated in this study. Participants in this study implemented multicultural music education through Holidays as well as thematic units. The participants most notably used foreign language songs, instruments from other countries, and foreign dances to teach multiculturally. Most participants believed that multicultural education should be implemented in the music classroom because of the diverse population of their classrooms and the communities in which they live. Lastly, this study found that Fayetteville and Springdale music educators are teaching multiculturally in their classrooms. One of the eight teachers was thought to be implementing Banks 2 ̆ 7 approach at level one, the contributions level. Six of the eight teachers were thought to be implementing Banks 2 ̆ 7 approach at level two, the additive level. One of the eight teachers was thought to be implementing Banks 2 ̆ 7 approach at level three, the transformation level...|$|R

This dissertation investigates those instructional practices in the social studies that contribute to at-risk high-school students' engagement or disengagement in learning. This study looked at methods of instruction and habits of interaction that students who are at risk of failure recognize as "engaging" within the context of classroom instruction. The basis for this study was the model of student engagement posited by Newmann, Wehlage, and Lamborn. This study is a qualitative study using a phenomenological framework. The methods used {{in the course of the}} study were interviews with open-ended questions and probes, which were taped and <b>transcribed.</b> The <b>transcribed</b> responses to the questions and probes were then coded and grouped independently and then compared to the model of engagement suggested by Newmann et al. Commonalities and differences were looked for, based upon Newmann et al. 's model. There were 12 participants in the study, of whom nine were males and three were females. All of the subjects were enrolled in an alternative high-school program for Proviso Township High Schools, District # 209, Cook County, Illinois. The 12 participants in this study were judged to be at-risk by the school district because they were 16 years of age or older, had average to above average academic potential, but were unsuccessful in school due to truancy. Of the 12, the racial and ethnic groups represented include African-American, Hispanic, and Caucasian and the group selected to participate was representative in proportion to the actual numbers of the various racial and ethnic groups in the school district. Newmann et al. 's model of student engagement posits that engagement occurs in classrooms and schools that address student needs of competence, school membership, and authentic work. Within these factors are additional factors that impact upon student engagement. The data that emerged from the interviews with study participants suggest that Newmann et al. 's model of engagement was accurate; additionally, other factors emerged from the interview context, which were added to the model...|$|R
