25|$|My illness {{helped me}} to see that what was missing in society is what was missing in me: a little heart, a lot of brotherhood. The 1980s were about {{acquiring}} – acquiring wealth, power, prestige. I know. I acquired more wealth, power, and prestige than most. But you can acquire all you want and still feel empty. What power wouldn't I trade {{for a little more}} time with my family? What price wouldn't I pay for an evening with friends? It took a deadly illness <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> eye to eye with that truth, but it is a truth that the country, caught up in its ruthless ambitions and moral decay, can learn on my dime. I don't know who will lead us through the '90s, but they must be made to speak to this spiritual vacuum at the heart of American society, this tumor of the soul.|$|E

But for this lunatic... to link me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia... <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> in league with Hamas murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing". Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, [...] "If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball." [...] When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric, Savage called him a [...] "foaming lunatic... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum... You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!" [...] At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.|$|E

500|$|Dworkin's {{work from}} the early 1980s onward {{contained}} frequent condemnations of incest and pedophilia {{as one of the}} chief forms of violence against women, arguing once that [...] "incest is terrifically important in understanding the condition of women. It is a crime committed against someone, a crime from which many victims never recover". In the early 1980s she had a public row with her former friend Allen Ginsberg over his support for child pornography and pedophilia, in which Ginsberg said, [...] "The right wants <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> in jail," [...] and Dworkin responded, [...] "Yes, they're very sentimental; I'd kill you." [...] In 1985, When Hustler published the claim that Dworkin advocated incest, Dworkin sued them for defamatory libel; the court dismissed Dworkin's complaint on the grounds that regardless of whether Hustlers interpretations of her reflections on incest were valid, even a faulty interpretation of a work placed into the [...] "marketplace of ideas" [...] could not amount to defamation in the legal sense.|$|E
500|$|While {{working in}} the studio for her fifth studio album, Beyoncé demanded from Miguel to write a song in which nothing was [...] "off-limits" [...] and where he could push the {{envelope}} creatively.

I wanna make music {{that makes me feel}} or shows that I feel hot and I'm confident and I wanna feel empowered because that's what I meant in my life'". For the opening lines of the song, Miguel was inspired by the singer herself: [...] "What's the first thing I'd want Beyoncé to say to me, as a man? What have I not heard her say? That's where the song came from." [...] He further noted that [...] "Rocket" [...] managed to showcase a new part of the singer which was confident, sexual and liberating at the same time.|$|E

In September that year, an admittedly nervous Watson delivered an address at UN Headquarters in New York City {{to launch the}} UN Women campaign HeForShe, which calls for men to advocate for gender equality. In that speech she said she began questioning gender-based assumptions at age eight when she was called [...] "bossy" [...] (a trait she has attributed to her being a [...] "perfectionist") whilst boys were not, and at 14 when she was [...] "sexualised by certain elements of the media". Watson's speech also called feminism [...] "the belief {{that men and women}} should have equal rights and opportunities" [...] and declared that the perception of [...] "man-hating" [...] is something that [...] "has to stop". Watson later said she received threats within 12 hours of making the speech, which left her [...] "raging. ... If they were trying <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> off , it did the opposite". In 2015, Malala Yousafzai told Watson she decided to call herself a feminist after hearing Watson's speech.|$|E

[...] In March, Favre hears Phil Simms say on Sirius Radio that as long as Favre can physically play the game, he should. Shortly thereafter, Favre confirms he would return to play. After the Packers defeated the Chicago Bears the last game of the season 26-7, Favre choked up during {{an interview}} with Andrea Kremer by saying [...] "If today's my last game, I want to remember it.

500|$|... "New Boss" [...] {{was written}} by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky and {{directed}} by Paul Feig. Executive story editor Charlie Grandy conceived the idea of Michael leaving Dunder Mifflin. [...] "New Boss" [...] {{was the first of}} six episodes Idris Elba was set to guest star in as Charles, Michael's new Dunder Mifflin superior. It was his first role in a comedy and his first television appearance since leaving his regular role on HBO's The Wire, where he played the character Stringer Bell. Elba, a fan of The Office, said, [...] "The creators of the show called me, said they wanted <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> in as this new character, that I’d be perfect for it, and I was honored, so I said yeah. [...] I’m still playing the straight guy, but he’s kind of got a bit of a quirk to him." [...] The writing staff for The Office are fans of The Wire, and have referred to the show in previous episodes. Of the six episodes Elba appeared in, he said [...] "New Boss" [...] was the only one he watched immediately after they aired because, [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, so I try not to torture myself." [...] Elba is the second actor from The Wire to appear on The Office, after actress Amy Ryan, who played Michael's love interest Holly Flax. Paul Lieberstein, the Office producer who also plays Toby, said Elba's work on The Wire made him [...] "a really interesting and great foil for Michael". John Krasinski said Elba was initially an intimidating presence on the set, due to the ruthless character he plays on The Wire. However, Krasinski said Elba proved to be [...] "incredibly nice and incredibly funny".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{were divided}} with the {{character}} development and the storylines in Tron: Legacy. Writing for The New Yorker, Bruce Jones commented that the audience didn't connect {{with the character}}s, as they were lacking emotion and substance. [...] "Disney may {{be looking for a}} merchandising bonanza with this long-gestating sequel to the groundbreaking 1982 film," [...] remarked Jones, [...] "but someone in the corporate offices forgot to add any human interest to its action-heavy script." [...] Likewise, USA Today journalist Claudia Puig found Tron: Legacy to resonate with [...] "nonsensical" [...] and [...] "unimaginative, even obfuscating" [...] dialogue, and that [...] "most of the story just doesn't scan". As Dana Stevens from Slate summed up, [...] "Tron: Legacy is the kind of sensory-onslaught blockbuster that tends <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> to sleep, the way babies will nap to block out overwhelming stimuli. I confess I may have snoozed through one or two climactic battles only to be startled awake by an incoming neon Frisbee." [...] Although he proclaimed the plot of Tron: Legacy and its predecessor to be spotty, Ian Buckwater of NPR was lenient of the latter film due to its youth-friendly nature. In contrast to negative responses, Michelle Alexander of Eclipse adored the plot of Tron: Legacy, a reaction that was paralleled by Rossiter Drake from 7x7, who wrote that it was [...] "buoyed" [...] by its [...] "sometimes convoluted, yet hard to resist" [...] story. Metros Larushka Ivan-Zadeh complained about the underdeveloped plot, saying [...] "In 2010, issues surrounding the immersive nature of gaming and all-consuming power of modern technology are more pertinent than ever, so it's frustrating the script does nothing with them." [...] However, she conceded that [...] "it's the best 3D flick since Avatar and a super-groovy soundtrack by Daft Punk nonetheless makes for an awesome watch".|$|E

2500|$|Smith found that, at the time, nobody {{believed}} in her concept of stylish activewear. As she later recalled, even major brands like Nike {{did not have}} concept stores for their clothing in those days. When Bill Clarkson showed the products to major department store Myer, their fashion buyers were uninterested and unsure of how to position the garments. He recalls that when he explained the clothes should not be sold in the sports section, [...] "The buyer {{looked at me like}} I was crazy. They had no box <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> in." [...] Eventually, Myer bought a small range for five of their stores and stocked it in a corner between swimwear and lingerie.

2500|$|Convinced {{that her}} career was being damaged by a {{succession}} of mediocre films, Davis accepted an offer in 1936 to appear in two films in Britain. Knowing that she was breaching her contract with Warner Bros., she fled to Canada to avoid legal papers being served upon her. Eventually, Davis brought her case to court in Britain, hoping {{to get out of}} her contract with Warner Bros. She later recalled the opening statement of the barrister, Sir Patrick Hastings, who represented Warner Bros. Hastings urged the court to [...] "come to the conclusion that this is rather a naughty young lady and that what she wants is more money." [...] He mocked Davis' description of her contract as [...] "slavery" [...] by stating, incorrectly, that she was being paid $1,350 per week. He remarked, [...] "if anybody wants <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> into perpetual servitude on the basis of that remuneration, I shall prepare to consider it." [...] The British press offered little support to Davis, and portrayed her as overpaid and ungrateful.|$|E
2500|$|In 1942, Buñuel {{applied for}} American citizenship, because he {{anticipated}} that MoMA {{would soon be}} put under federal control. [...] But that same year, Dalí published his autobiography, The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí, in which {{he made it clear}} that he had split with Buñuel because the latter was a Communist and an atheist. News of this reached Archbishop Spellman, who [...] angrily confronted Barry with the question: [...] "Are you aware that you are harbouring in this Museum the Antichrist, the man who made a blasphemous film L'Age d'Or?" [...] At the same time, a campaign on the part of Hollywood, through its industry trade paper, the Motion Picture Herald, to undermine the MoMA film unit resulted in a 66% reduction in the department's budget and Buñuel felt himself compelled to resign. [...] In 1944, he returned to Hollywood for the third time, this time as Spanish Dubbing Producer for Warner Brothers. Before leaving New York, he confronted Dalí at his hotel, the Sherry Netherland, to tell the painter about the damage his book had done and then shoot him in the knee. Buñuel did not carry out the violent part of his plan. Dalí explained himself by saying: [...] "I did not write my book to put YOU on a pedestal.
