Graduating as a {{lieutenant}} three years later, he served in a variety of staff and instructional positions before the outbreak of the Second World War. Initially posted to the 7th Division as a staff officer in 1940, Wells was promoted to lieutenant colonel and made senior liaison officer <b>to</b> <b>I</b> Corps. Serving in Greece and North Africa, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership at El Alamein.

Following {{the outbreak of the}} Pacific War, the corps headquarters and the 6th and 7th Divisions were returned to Australia in early 1942 to bolster the country's defences; the movement of these troops was designated Operation Stepsister. The Australian Government agreed to British and United States requests to temporarily retain the 9th Division in the Middle East in exchange for the deployment of more United States Army units to Australia and Britain's support for a proposal to expand the Royal Australian Air Force to 73 flying squadrons. The 9th Division {{played an important role in}} the First Battle of El Alamein during July 1942 and the Second Battle of El Alamein between 23 October and 4 November. The division suffered many casualties during the latter engagement, and did not take part in the subsequent pursuit of the retreating Axis forces.|$|E

From May until September 1968, the division participated in local pacification missions, as well as Medical outreach programs intended to offer medical support to the Vietnamese local population.
