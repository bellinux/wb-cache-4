5|$|Bush won <b>the</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses,</b> and {{although}} he was heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary, he trailed McCain by 19percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum, and according to political observers, he effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary—which according to The Boston Globe—made history for his campaign's negativity. The New York Times {{described it as a}} smear campaign.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses,</b> Keyes did {{not appear}} {{on any of the}} {{election}} totals. Keyes stated that many of the caucus locations he visited did not list him as a choice. His campaign CEO, Stephen Stone blamed much of this on the media and on Keyes's decision to enter the race late. Stone explained that the media would not acknowledge Keyes's candidacy, making it difficult to run an effective campaign.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} contest, the 2012 Iowa caucuses of January 3, {{election}} officials announced Romney as ahead with 25percent of the vote, edging out a late-gaining Rick Santorum by eight votes (an also-strong Ron Paul finished third). Sixteen days later, however, they certified Santorum {{as the winner}} by a 34-vote margin. A week after <b>the</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses,</b> Romney earned a decisive win in the New Hampshire primary {{with a total of}} 39percent of the vote; Paul finished second and Jon Huntsman, Jr. third.|$|E

5|$|The 2008 presidential {{campaign}} of Chris Dodd was launched on January 11, 2007 and ended on January 3, 2008 after a sixth-place finish in <b>the</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses.</b> Dodd, the Senior Senator from Connecticut, sought {{the nomination of}} the Democratic Party for President of the United States. Centering his campaign in the strategically important states of Iowa and New Hampshire, he tried to bring forth a platform of change. Dodd's performance in the opinion polls varied, but in the financial sphere, he had secured some notable and influential endorsements who had sufficiently funded his campaign.|$|E
5|$|While having name recognition, McGovern {{had little}} funding or staff, {{although}} he did garner critical funding from some celebrities and statesmen. He won a surprise third-place showing in <b>the</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses</b> amidst a crowded field of candidates, but finished fifth in the New Hampshire primary. He announced he would drop out unless he finished first or second in the Massachusetts primary, {{and when he came}} in third behind his former campaign manager Gary Hart and former Vice President Walter Mondale, he made good on his promise. He later endorsed Mondale, the eventual Democratic nominee. McGovern hosted Saturday Night Live on April 14, 1984.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} contest of the {{primaries}} season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders, making {{her the first}} woman to win <b>the</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses.</b> In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin. Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20, but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers. Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27. These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.|$|E

5|$|Underwood {{announces that}} he will not run for reelection, and advocates for America Works, which he intends to pay for by {{stripping}} entitlement programs. He fails to get the bill through Congress and uses that as a reason to renege on his promise to not run in 2016. Solicitor General Heather Dunbar (Elizabeth Marvel) announces that she will seek the presidential nomination, and actually gives Underwood a battle. Underwood convinces Sharp to get married so she can announce her candidacy, for the sole reason of sapping women’s votes from Dunbar, at which point she will withdraw and accept the nomination for VP. After the presidential debate, in which Underwood publicly humiliates Sharp in order to go after Dunbar, Sharp retaliates by backing Dunbar's campaign. Ultimately, however, Underwood wins <b>the</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gravel did {{not compete}} in the initial 2008 vote, <b>the</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses,</b> but was still {{subjected}} to a false report from MSNBC that he had {{pulled out of the}} race afterward. Gravel did focus his attention on the second 2008 vote, the New Hampshire primary. There he received about 400 votes out of some 280,000 cast, or 0.14percent, before taking time off to improve his health. He resumed campaigning, but fared no better in subsequent states. By the end of January 2008, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Gravel were the only remaining Democrats from the initial debates still running; Gravel vowed to stay in the presidential campaign until November. On March 11, 2008, Gravel continued to remain in the Democratic race but additionally endorsed a Green Party candidate for president, Jesse Johnson, saying he wanted to help Johnson prevail against Green Party rivals Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader. By late March, Gravel had almost no fundraising and was only on the ballot in one of the next ten Democratic primaries.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, McCain skipped most of <b>the</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses</b> {{during his}} presidential bid, {{in large part}} because his {{opposition}} to ethanol subsidies was a nonstarter in a state where making corn into fuel was a large and profitable business.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>Caucuses</b> are {{the kickoff}} for the {{national}} presidential selection process. Iowa holds a powerful position in that process because it {{can serve as a}} sounding board for the strength of a candidate's campaign. A win in <b>the</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>Caucuses</b> can validate a candidate or propel them from relative obscurity. In particular the Iowa Republican Caucuses hold the most power when either the GOP is not the party in the presidency or an incumbent is not on the ballot. As Iowa is the first state to cast its votes on the nominee the media often focus heavily on opinion polls from the state to determine which way Republican voters are leaning.|$|E
