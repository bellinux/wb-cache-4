Only 86 vehicles were produced in 1941, {{but this was}} increased in 1942 during which 1,350 examples came off the production lines. A further 766 were completed in 1943. Production was stopped due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of turreted, purpose-built, tank destroyers, such as the M10 GMC.|$|E

5|$|After {{a failure}} to {{assimilate}} Indigenous children by early missionaries in the 17th century, educational programs were not widely attempted again by religious officials until the 1820s, prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of state-sanctioned operations. Included among them was a school established by John West, an Anglican missionary, at the Red River Colony in what is today Manitoba. Protestant missionaries also opened residential schools in the current Ontario region, spreading Christianity and working to encourage Indigenous peoples to adopt subsistence agriculture {{as a way to}} ensure they would not return to their original, nomadic ways of life upon graduation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the main}} story ends here, the {{introduction}} of the Broken Steel DLC creates a new choice with the ending, in that the Lone Wanderer can send one of their radiation-immune companions into the chamber to input the code. Furthermore, the game remains open-ended from this point onwards, with the Wanderer surviving the radiation they were subjected to, and recovering two weeks later to the news that the purifier is working well and supplying clean water {{to the people of the}} waste, or has been having an adverse effect on life thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of the modified FEV. Sarah Lyons does not survive if sent into the chamber in the Broken Steel ending.|$|E
5|$|At {{its maximum}} extent, Tang {{expansion}} brought China into {{direct contact with}} the rising Umayyad Caliphate. China's western borders reached the eastern frontier of the Caliphate. Following the Arab defeat of Sassanid Persia in 651, the Caliphate began its expansion into Central Asia, competing with the Tang's sphere of influence in the region. Chinese and Islamic troops finally clashed at the Battle of Talas in 751. The Chinese lost against the Arabs, now under Abbasid rule, and the Arab army captured Chinese papermaking craftsmen. An Arabic record of the conflict claims that the battle led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of papermaking to the Islamic world.|$|E

5|$|Chronophotograpic {{studies of}} animals in motion, created by {{scientist}} Étienne-Jules Marey beginning in the 1880s, led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> in painting of techniques to show motion, such as blurring, multiplication, and superimposition of body parts—perhaps {{in an effort to}} imitate these mechanical images. Such multiplication can be see in Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, painted the same year as Balla's painting.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, clocks {{primarily}} served religious purposes; {{the first}} employed for secular timekeeping emerged around the 15th century. In Dublin, the official measurement of time became a local custom, and by 1466 a public clock stood {{on top of}} the Tholsel (the city court and council chamber). It was {{the first of its kind}} to be clearly recorded in Ireland, and would only have had an hour hand. The increasing lavishness of castles led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of turret clocks. A 1435 example survives from Leeds castle; its face is decorated with the images of the Crucifixion of Jesus, Mary and St George.|$|E

5|$|England have {{typically}} worn all-white shirts, white shorts with navy and white socks. The emblem on the shirts {{is a red}} rose, rather than the Plantagenet Three Lions displayed on the shirts of the England football and cricket teams. The strip is manufactured by Canterbury and O2 is the shirt sponsor. The change strip is normally red, although prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of the red strip, navy blue was used and was reintroduced for the 2016-17 season. Purple {{was used as the}} change strip as of the 2009 autumn internationals, reflecting the traditional colour of the original England track-suits from the 1960s, 70s and 80s. For the 2011 Rugby World Cup the change kit was black.|$|E
5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This is partly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive {{the same amount of}} nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E
5|$|Home to Aboriginal {{groups for}} over 40,000 years, the Riverina was {{originally}} settled by Europeans in {{the mid-19th century}} as a pastoral region providing beef and wool to markets in Australia and beyond. In the 20th century, the development of major irrigation areas in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys has led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of crops such as rice and wine grapes. The Riverina has strong cultural ties to Victoria, and the region {{was the source of}} much of the impetus behind the federation of Australian colonies.|$|E
