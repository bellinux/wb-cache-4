Spectral image recording systems are first and foremost imaging devices, and so can be compared against the performance of more familiar digital cameras and scanners. The quality of the images acquired can be assessed by the well-established methods of visual scaling and psychophysics, with observers judging each image either in isolation or side-by-side with a reference image [26]. Various attributes of image quality can be distinguished and scaled, including <b>tonal</b> <b>rendering,</b> colour, sharpness, naturalness, freedom from defects, etc.|$|E

50|$|At {{about the}} same time, French {{engravers}} developed a modified technique (partly a return to that of Bewick) in which cross-hatching (one set of parallel lines crossing another at an angle) was almost entirely eliminated. Instead, all <b>tonal</b> gradations were <b>rendered</b> by white lines of varying thickness and closeness, sometimes broken into dots for the darkest areas. This technique appears in engravings from Gustave Doré's drawings.|$|R

40|$|Improved print {{quality has}} been become an {{important}} issue for the flexographic printing method. This {{is especially true in}} the area of fine quality halftone reproduction. The nature of this printing method which uses elastic materials for its printing plate is difficult to control. The main issue is the control of the pressure between the plate and the substrate. Extensive research has been done to change the hardness and the structure of the plate, however, the pressure used to transfer ink still remains a critical factor in achieving good halftone quality. Although the critical pressure control of the impression from plate to substrate is accomplished mechnically by the press operator, the pressure between the plate and substrate appears to be physically uncontrolable. Equal pressure across the plate to the substrate can create a large quantity of dot gzin in the highlight area. This problem is caused by the relief height difference between the highlight and shadow areas. This paper suggests {{a solution to the problem}} of excessive dot gain in the highlight areas by the use of the duotone technique. A test was performed which compared a normal duotone technique using equal plate pressure for each plate and a experimental duotone technique for flexography which involves the use of a different amount of pressure for each printing plate. The <b>tonal</b> <b>rendering</b> characteristics were determined and compared for each duotone technique. The test results indicate that there was no improved image quality by the use of the experimental duotone technique described in this paper. Suggestions are included for further study on this subject to improve halftone quality by flexography...|$|E
