40|$|This paper investigates {{opportunities}} and challenges when implementing trajectory-based <b>taxi</b> <b>operations</b> at airports dependent {{on the availability of}} Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) processes in Europe and the U. S. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) jointly developed a concept of <b>operations</b> for trajectory-based <b>taxi</b> <b>operations.</b> An essential prerequisite of this concept is that adequate information sharing processes referring to collaborative decision making are available. CDM concepts like Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) and Surface Collaborative Decision Making (S-CDM) were introduced by EUROCONTROL and the FAA, respectively, to improve the use of the available airport infrastructure. Both concepts aim to improve the efficiency of airport operations by reducing congestion on the airport surface, improving the traffic flow efficiency, and reducing uncertainties during airport operations. Both concepts are compared in this paper with a focus on <b>taxi</b> <b>operations</b> and the impact on the stakeholders. This paper provides an answer to the question which {{opportunities and}} challenges might be faced with the implementation of trajectory-based <b>taxi</b> <b>operations</b> at airports with A-CDM and S-CDM. Especially from the perspective of involved stakeholders, their operational objectives that are partially contradicting to each other are discussed. It is shown that both CDM processes generally leverage the implementation of trajectory-based <b>taxi</b> <b>operations.</b> However, there are still existing gaps that are identified and addressed based on current {{research in the area of}} airport surface traffic optimization towards trajectory-based <b>taxi</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Low-visibility {{conditions}} {{present a}} host of problems for the National Airspace System. While many modern aircraft are equipped with automation {{that allows them to}} land under low-visibility conditions, there is no such corresponding technology to aid the pilots in taxiing the aircraft from runway to gate, or vice versa. Consequently, flight throughput and sequencing is severely constrained, especially at the major airports. Current efforts within NASA, the FAA, and the commercial aviation industry are aimed at developing technologies to increase the efficiency and safety of <b>taxi</b> <b>operations</b> under low-visibility conditions. Based on cockpit observations, pilot interviews, and pilot-controller communications, this paper presents an analysis of current problems experienced by pilots during the <b>taxi</b> <b>operations,</b> and presents their views on key issues related to the introduction of electronic taxi map displays in the cockpit. The data were collected by the author while serving as a flight deck observer aboard thirty-five commercial carrier flights. The implications of these data for the justification and design of advanced cockpit displays for <b>taxi</b> <b>operations</b> are discussed, and the importance of including pilot experiences, opinions, and attitudes in the research and design process is stressed...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft <b>taxi</b> <b>operations</b> {{have been}} shown to be inefficient and prone to high workload, radio {{frequency}} congestion, and communication errors (Kelley & Adam, 1997). Further, in low-visibility or night taxi conditions, taxi speeds decrease by approximately 20 % and navigation errors increase leaving aircraft prone to traffic incursions (McCann, et al., 1998). To increase the efficiency and safety of surface operations, the Taxiway Navigation and Situation Awareness (T-NASA) cockpit display suite, comprised of an electronic moving map, a scene-linked head-up display, and 3 -D audio alerts, was proposed (Foyle, et al., 1996). The T-NASA display suite has been subject to an extensive design and evaluation process (Andre, Hooey, Foyle, & McCann, 1998; McCann et al, 1998;), however, less is known about issues associated with the implementation of these displays into current and future <b>taxi</b> <b>operations.</b> This study set out to address several operational issues that were identified by pilots and controllers in a series of scenario-based focus groups (Hooey et al., 1999).

It is possible to understand the features of real traffic by a spatiotemporal analysis approach for real measured traffic data. In this paper, a space-time visualization analysis method is designed and carried out for taxi spatiotemporal dataset from Beijing floating car data acquisition system and Beijing GIS data. Through this method, large-amount taxi GPS data is processed and the spatial-temporal trajectory is analyzed. And then taxi daily operation time, operating range and residence location of individual driver, vehicle operation and rest periods and other indicators are calculated, which are important characteristic parameters of Beijing Taxi Operations. In sum, continuous, comprehensive, and dynamic analysis information for monitoring <b>taxi</b> <b>operation</b> status can be acquired through the method.

40|$|The {{demand for}} air traffic {{transportation}} has constantly been increasing {{over the past}} decades. Forecasts predict a continuing steady growth in the near-term for Europe and the U. S., where the aviation systems are already facing capacity constraints. One major constraint is the airport capacity, which influences {{the performance of the}} entire aviation system. The objective of this master’s thesis is the comparison of collaborative decision making (CDM) processes at airports in Europe (A-CDM) and the U. S (S-CDM) to evaluate which CDM concept supports the introduction of trajectory based <b>taxi</b> <b>operations</b> preferably. CDM concepts at airports promote information sharing and cooperation of airport stakeholders to optimize the management of traffic flows and reduce uncertainties during ground <b>operations.</b> Trajectory-based <b>taxi</b> <b>operations</b> aim to reduce the temporal uncertainty during the taxi phase by assigning conflict-free taxi trajectories for all aircraft on the airport surface. The evaluation shows that both CDM concepts offer comparable information sharing capabilities, however, differ significantly in the approach used to manage of departure traffic flows. Therefore, different generic departure scenarios are applied as use cases to evaluate how the respective CDM departure management approaches affect the introduction of trajectory-based <b>taxi</b> <b>operations.</b> The walkthrough of these scenarios in the respective CDM environments shows that both concepts support trajectory-based <b>taxi</b> <b>operations.</b> However, A-CDM, which sequences departures strategically by assigning target times as time constraints, provides more stable input data for the creation of taxi trajectories, compared to S-CDM. S-CDM allows much operational freedom to the airlines and relies on reactive departure management. Preliminary research results by DLR and NASA, which provide concepts and tools to support the proposed concept, are explained to assess the feasibility of the desired functions...|$|R
