5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are {{assigned}} to the case. Discussing the photograph, Mulder tells Scully about Ted Serios, who was famous for making photos which showed what was in his mind. He takes pictures of his gloved hand using a camera found in Lefante's apartment, and they all appear the same as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> the pharmacy. Mulder deduces that the kidnapper has been stalking his victims.|$|E
5|$|More {{shots of}} the band, {{cityscape}} and 'SFA' monster follow until the final verse, when the view returns to {{the road from the}} beginning of the video. The camera then flies up inside a skyscraper made entirely of small images of a mouth singing the along with the track. As the song finishes the view again returns to the road. Small spaceships (similar to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> the middle 8) gather at either side as the city is left behind and the road gradually disappears.|$|E
5|$|The leading themes {{revolve around}} the nature of Tao and how to attain it. Tao {{is said to be}} ineffable, and {{accomplishing}} great things through small means. Ancient commentaries on the Tao Te Ching are important texts in their own right. Perhaps the oldest one, the Heshang Gong commentary, was most likely written in the 2nd century CE. Other important commentaries include <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> Wang Bi and the Xiang'er.|$|E

50|$|If {{reflections}} of a nonomino are considered distinct, {{as they are}} with one-sided nonominoes, then the first and fourth categories above double in size, resulting in an extra 1,215 nonominoes {{for a total of}} 2,500. If rotations are also considered distinct, then the nonominoes from the first category count eightfold, <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> next three categories count fourfold, <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fifth category count twice, and <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> last category count only once. This results in 1,196 × 8 + (38+26+19) × 4 + 4 × 2 + 2 = 9,910 fixed nonominoes.|$|R

5|$|Agnolín and Novas (2013) found Archaeopteryx and (possibly synonymous) Wellnhoferia {{to be the}} basalmost avialans (Avialae being {{defined by}} the authors as {{including}} Archaeopteryx lithographica and Passer, their most recent common ancestor {{and all of its}} descendants), with Microraptoria, Unenlagiinae, and the clade containing Anchiornis and Xiaotingia being successively closer outgroups to the Avialae. Another phylogenetic study by Godefroit, et al., using a more inclusive matrix than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> the analysis in the description of Eosinopteryx brevipenna, also found Archaeopteryx {{to be a member of}} Avialae (defined by the authors as the most inclusive clade containing Passer domesticus, but not Dromaeosaurus albertensis or Troodon formosus). Archaeopteryx was found to form a grade at the base of Avialae with Xiaotingia, Anchiornis, and Aurornis. Compared to Archaeopteryx, Xiaotingia was found to be more closely related to extant birds, while both Anchiornis and Aurornis were found to be more distantly so.|$|E
5|$|Doug and Claire {{go to the}} ferry. Doug {{boards to}} try to find and disarm the bomb, but {{meanwhile}} Oerstadt has found Claire and bound her in the bomb car. A brutal gunfight ensues which culminates with Doug attempting to negotiate with Oerstadt but finally catching him off guard and killing him. He gets into the car to try to free Claire but police surround the vehicle and threaten to open fire. To save everyone, Doug and Claire purposely drive the bomb SUV off the end of the ferry before it explodes. Claire escapes but Doug, unable {{to get out of the}} vehicle, dies in the underwater explosion. As Claire mourns Doug's death, she is approached by an identical Doug Carlin, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> her present, who consoles her.|$|E
5|$|Each driver {{cell in the}} LIFE {{baseline}} design contained two of the high-density diode arrays {{arranged on}} either side of a large slab of laser glass. The arrays were provided cooling via hook-up pipes {{at either end of the}} module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a preamplifier module similar to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and Pockel's cell optical switch. To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the light through the glass four times, in a fashion similar to NIF. Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics {{on either side of}} the glass, before the beam exited the system through a frequency converter at one end.|$|E

5|$|Frank Oz voices Yoda, the centuries-old {{leader of}} the Jedi Council who is {{apprehensive}} about allowing Anakin to be trained. Yoda was mostly portrayed as a puppet designed by Nick Dudman based on Stuart Freeborn's original design. Oz controlled the puppet's mouth and other parts were controlled by puppeteers using remote controls. Lucas fitted Yoda's filming around Oz's schedule as he finished and promoted In & Out. A computer-generated Yoda is featured in two distant shots. Warwick Davis portrays him in the scene in which Obi-Wan becomes a Jedi Knight. Lucas said he originally wanted to use a full-time digital Yoda, but the attempts did not work well enough. On the Blu-ray release of The Phantom Menace, which was also used for the 3D reissue, a CG Yoda similar to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> the other prequels is used instead.|$|E
5|$|I-97 {{temporarily}} gains {{two extra}} lanes {{in each direction}} between MD 100 and its partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 176 (Dorsey Road). Access from the southbound Interstate to MD 176 is via MD 162 (Aviation Boulevard), which forms part of the Airport Loop surrounding Baltimore–Washington International Airport. I-97 continues through Ferndale, where it crosses over the Glen Burnie branch of the Baltimore Light Rail immediately before the highway's four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 648 (Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard), which provides access to the transit line's terminal station, Cromwell Station / Glen Burnie. I-97's final interchange is with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). The Interstate crosses the Cabin Branch of Curtis Creek within the interchange, which includes a flyover ramp from I-97 to westbound I-695; that ramp and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> eastbound I-695 to I-97 merge {{on the inside of}} the two carriageways of the Beltway. The Interstate drops to four lanes and reaches its northern terminus just north of the loop ramp from westbound I-695 to I-97 in Brooklyn Park. The highway continues as I-895A, a pair of ramps that merge with the spur from I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) to MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway). The continuation from I-97 includes a ramp to westbound I-695 that allows access to the Beltway's interchange with MD 648.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a study scrutinised {{two major}} {{populations of the}} Swayne's hartebeest, from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary and the Nechisar National Park, for {{mitochondrial}} (D-loop) and nuclear (microsatellite) variability {{in an attempt to}} estimate the levels of genetic variation between the populations and within the subspecies. The results showed a remarkable differentiation between the two populations; that from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary showed more genetic diversity than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> the Nechisar National Park. Another revelation was that the translocation of the individuals from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary in 1974 had not made a significant contribution to the gene pool of the Nechisar National Park. Additionally, the Swayne hartebeest populations were compared with a large red hartebeest population, and both subspecies were found to have a high degree of genetic variation. The study advocated in situ conservation of the Swayne's hartebeest and a renewed attempt at its translocation in order to conserve genetic diversity and increase its population size in both the protected areas.|$|E

5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E
5|$|Later, Morales and Ramsey {{receive a}} report about a stolen car that matches <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> the Turner and Cook murders. While {{investigating}} a sand pit, they encounter the Phantom. Morales shoots at him but misses, {{causing him to}} run into the woods. The Phantom escapes by jumping past a moving train, but is shot in the leg. While the officers {{are waiting for the}} train to pass, the Phantom escapes. They continue their search, but never find him. Years later during the Christmas season of 1976, the film The Town That Dreaded Sundown premieres in Texarkana and the shoes of the Phantom are seen on someone standing in line.|$|E
5|$|NHL 17 was {{released}} for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles on September 13, 2016 in North America and September 15 in Europe. Pre-orders of any {{edition of the}} game came with a special EASHL equipment bundle {{as well as a}} unique goal celebration, imitating <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> NHL '94. The Deluxe and Super Deluxe editions came with extra gold packs for the Hockey Ultimate Team mode, delivered weekly for a certain amount of time, with the Super Deluxe edition offering more packs than the Deluxe.

5|$|Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) {{has been}} taken to a disused medical {{facility}} by David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) and his agents. She {{is placed in the}} same room along with Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), also secured to a chair, revealing she was also abducted by Jones the night before. Jones arrives and asserts that Olivia has great abilities due to her Cortexiphan doping but he must coax them out of Olivia. He presents a light box test that Olivia should be able to activate with her mind, torturing Nina to create the emotional driver, but Olivia admits she can't do it without rest. During this period, Olivia, her memories a mix of her own and that of Olivia from Peter Bishop's (Joshua Jackson) timeline, asks Nina to help her make an emotional connection, but she recognizes that this Nina is not the real one but instead <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> the parallel universe. Olivia continues to play along, explaining to Nina that her Cortexiphan abilities could only be induced by being near Peter; Nina fakes illness to be extracted from the room, where she explains to a complicit Jones that they need to abduct Peter.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. In the first part of qualifying (Q1), Nico Rosberg set a time of 1:23.002, the fastest of the weekend up to that point, two-tenths of a second ahead of teammate Hamilton. Manor and Sauber occupied the back rows of the grid. Felipe Massa's first lap was seven-tenths of a second slower than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> his teammate Bottas and as he was unable to set another timed lap, he became the surprise elimination in Q1, behind Jolyon Palmer, who was dropped into 17th place by a late improvement from Jenson Button.|$|E
5|$|The Coens {{referenced}} the noir tradition {{again with}} The Man Who Wasn't There (2001); a black-and-white crime melodrama set in 1949, {{it features a}} scene apparently staged to mirror <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> Out of the Past pictured above. Lynch's Mulholland Drive (2001) continued in his characteristic vein, making the classic noir setting of Los Angeles the venue for a noir-inflected psychological jigsaw puzzle. British-born director Christopher Nolan's black-and-white debut, Following (1998), was an overt homage to classic noir. During the new century's first decade, {{he was one of}} the leading Hollywood directors of neo-noir with the acclaimed Memento (2000) and the remake of Insomnia (2002).|$|E
