5|$|Losing the undersheriff {{position}} left Wyatt Earp {{without a}} job in Tombstone; however, Wyatt and his brothers were beginning {{to make some money}} on their mining claims in the Tombstone area. In January 1881, Oriental Saloon owner Mike Joyce gave Wyatt Earp a one-quarter interest in the faro concession at <b>the</b> <b>Oriental</b> Saloon in exchange for his services as a manager and enforcer. Gambling was regarded as a legitimate profession, comparable to a doctor or member of clergy, at the time. Wyatt invited his friend, lawman and gambler Bat Masterson, to Tombstone to help him run the faro tables in <b>the</b> <b>Oriental</b> Saloon. In June 1881, Wyatt also telegraphed another friend and gambler from Dodge, Luke Short, who was living in Leadville, Colorado, and offered him a job as a faro dealer.|$|E
5|$|Milt Joyce, {{a county}} {{supervisor}} {{and owner of}} <b>the</b> <b>Oriental</b> Saloon, had a contentious relationship with Doc Holliday. In October 1880, Holliday had trouble with a gambler named Johnny Tyler in Milt Joyce's Oriental Saloon. Tyler had been hired by a competing gambling establishment to drive customers from <b>the</b> <b>Oriental</b> Saloon. Holliday challenged Tyler to a fight, but Tyler ran. Joyce did not like Holliday or the Earps and he continued to argue with Holliday. Joyce ordered Holliday removed from the saloon but would not return Holliday's revolver. But Holliday returned carrying a double-action revolver. Milt brandished a pistol and threatened Holliday, but Holliday shot Joyce in the palm, disarming him, and then shot Joyce's business partner William Parker in the big toe. Joyce then hit Holliday {{over the head with}} his revolver. Holliday was arrested and pleaded guilty to assault and battery.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{subspecies}} have been named, of which 12 were recognised in the Handbook of the Birds of the World. These subspecies are divided into two groups, the Palaearctic P. d. domesticus group, and <b>the</b> <b>Oriental</b> P. d. indicus group. Several Middle Eastern subspecies, including P. d. biblicus, are sometimes considered a third, intermediate group. The subspecies P. d. indicus {{was described as a}} species, and was considered to be distinct by many ornithologists during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Although {{influenced}} by Matisse, <b>the</b> <b>Oriental</b> art that Jolin discovered at Musée Guimet {{was even more}} important to his style. Chinese and Japanese art became the base for the decorative, slightly naïve style in light colours, that he developed during the 1910s and 1920s. Jolin's style deviates {{from that of the}} traditional Expressionists, in that he simplifies his motifs in an almost primitive way, painting an imagined reality rather than raw emotions.|$|E

5|$|In Byzantine literature, four {{different}} cultural elements are recognised: the Greek, the Christian, the Roman, and <b>the</b> <b>Oriental.</b> Byzantine literature is often classified in five groups: historians and annalists, encyclopaedists (Patriarch Photios, Michael Psellus, and Michael Choniates {{are regarded as}} the greatest encyclopaedists of Byzantium) and essayists, and writers of secular poetry. The only genuine heroic epic of the Byzantines is the Digenis Acritas. The remaining two groups include the new literary species: ecclesiastical and theological literature, and popular poetry.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Orientals</b> {{organised}} <b>the</b> Congress of Florida {{and requested}} reunification with the United Provinces of the River Plate.

Regardless, the Brazilian army retained the northeast of the country, allowing it {{to keep in touch with}} its metropolis.For this reason, <b>the</b> <b>Orientals</b> took action to regain control of this area, culminating in the capture of the Fortress of Santa Teresa on 31 December 1825; which was located in the Rocha Department, near the present border with Brazil.|$|R

As more industrial art subjects were added, a separate arts and trade school on the secondary level called <b>the</b> Negros <b>Oriental</b> Trade School, which became the East Visayan School of Arts and Trades in 1956 and the Central Visayas Polytechnic College in 1983. In 2004, it is then converted into what is now <b>the</b> Negros <b>Oriental</b> State University.|$|R
5|$|In {{a period}} of two years, Oriental {{released}} four films; all were feature length, made in black-and-white, and received wide releases in the Dutch East Indies. Some, such as Panggilan Darah, enjoyed international release; the film was screened in Singapore (then part of the Straits Settlements) by September 1941. The company's productions were targeted at low-income audiences and extensively used kroncong music, for the recording of which the company established <b>the</b> <b>Oriental</b> Novelty Five. Though its films were screened at least into the 1950s, Oriental's output may be lost.|$|E
5|$|The figures, the {{minutely}} detailed clothes, and {{the architecture}} of the room and windows are depicted {{with a high degree of}} realism.

5|$|The {{film was}} {{screened}} on 31December 1926 at <b>the</b> <b>Oriental</b> and Elita Theatres in Bandung, {{making it the}} first domestically-produced feature film and the first with a native cast.

The film was screened for only a week, with live Sundanese gamelan performances providing music, after which Loetoeng Kasaroeng was replaced with Hollywood films.

50|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>orientals</b> still resented <b>the</b> Brazilian rule. <b>The</b> Thirty-Three <b>Orientals</b> led a {{rebellion}} that liberated <b>the</b> banda <b>oriental,</b> and requested {{to rejoin the}} United Provinces.

Despite of the military victories, the Argentine president Bernardino Rivadavia needed the army to fight against the federal caudillos, so he sent a diplomat to rush an end of hostilities. The treaty declared the disputed area to be an independent nation, and not part of either Argentina or Brazil.|$|R

5|$|While the {{original}} touring cast intended {{to play a}} limited engagement from April 29 to June 12, 2005 at <b>the</b> <b>Oriental</b> Theatre in Chicago, producers decided to extend it to an open-ended run, making it the first non-Broadway sit-down production of Wicked. Opening at the same Chicago theatre {{the day after the}} touring production had finished, {{the original}} Chicago cast included Ana Gasteyer as Elphaba, Kate Reinders as Glinda, Rondi Reed as Madame Morrible, Kristoffer Cusick as Fiyero, Telly Leung as Boq, Heidi Kettenring as Nessarose and Gene Weygandt as the Wizard. The production closed on January 25, 2009, after over 1,500 performances. The touring production returned to Chicago for a special engagement at the Cadillac Palace Theatre from December 1, 2010 to January 23, 2011.

5|$|After {{the nine}} Études-Tableaux, Op. 39, Rachmaninoff {{composed}} several minor works in 1917. <b>The</b> <b>Oriental</b> Sketch is a fast-paced piece littered with sixteenth note figures. The piece {{was not intended}} {{to be associated with the}} Orient; the title was given by the publisher. The Prelude in D minor, a dark piece with thick and fast moving chords that repeatedly descend into low register, is a manifestation of his unhappiness with the October Revolution. The manuscript survived and was first published in 1973. His penultimate piano composition (only his Corelli Variations came later) was a one-page piece entitled Fragments, a brief nostalgic piece from his final days in Moscow. It was first published in the magazine, The Etude, in 1919.|$|E
