5|$|Lewis Wendell Willkie {{was born}} in Elwood, Indiana, on February 18, 1892, the son of Henrietta (Trisch) and Herman Francis Willkie. Both of his parents were lawyers, his mother {{being one of the}} first women {{admitted}} to the Indiana bar. His father {{was born in}} Germany and his mother was born in Indiana, to German parents; his grandparents were involved in the unsuccessful 1848 revolutions in Germany. The Trisches initially settled in Kansas Territory but, as they were abolitionists, moved to Indiana after the territory was opened to slavery in the mid-1850s. Willkie was the fourth of six children, all intelligent, and learned skills during <b>the</b> <b>nightly</b> debates around the dinner table that would later serve him well.|$|E

Writer Roger Henderson tries to solve the killings, much to the annoyance of the police, led by Lieutenant Cross.|$|E
5|$|According {{to his own}} account, {{the idea}} for writing Dreamtime first came to Duerr {{when he was in}} New Mexico in the summer of 1963. He had spent the day visiting the Puye Cliff Dwellings and was {{returning}} to the Albuquerque Greyhound Bus Station, where he met a Tewa Native yerbatero (herbalist) buying a cup of coffee, and struck up a conversation. Duerr asked the yerbatero if he could help him find a Native family living in one of the pueblos north of Santa Fe with whom he could stay, to conduct anthropological research into <b>the</b> <b>nightly</b> dances {{that took place in the}} subterranean kivas. The Native told him that if he wanted to find out about the dances in the kivas, then he should go to the Pueblo of Our Lady of the Angels and study at the University of California. Duerr would later relate that this blow to his vanity first provided him with the idea of writing Dreamtime.|$|E

5|$|Britain, whose {{troops were}} forced to {{evacuate}} France by sea from Dunkirk, continued to fight alongside other British dominions in the Battle of the Atlantic. Hitler made peace overtures to the new British leader, Winston Churchill, and upon their rejection he ordered a series of aerial attacks on Royal Air Force airbases and radar stations in south-east England. On 7 September the systematic nightly bombing of London began. The German Luftwaffe failed to defeat the Royal Air Force in {{what became known as}} the Battle of Britain. By the end of September, Hitler realised that air superiority for the invasion of Britain (in Operation Sea Lion) could not be achieved, and ordered the operation postponed. <b>The</b> <b>nightly</b> air raids on British cities intensified and continued for months, including London, Plymouth, and Coventry.|$|E
5|$|Having {{resolved}} {{to explore the}} island of Rasay, which could be done only on foot, I last night obtained my fellow-traveller’s permission to leave him for a day, he being unable to take so hardy a walk. Old Mr Malcolm M’Cleod, who had obligingly promised to accompany me, was at my bedside between five and six. I sprang up immediately, and he and I, attended by two other gentlemen, traversed the country during the whole of this day. Though we had passed over not less than four-and-twenty miles of very rugged ground, and had a Highland dance {{on the top of}} Dùn Can, the highest mountain in the island, we returned in the evening not at all fatigued, and piqued ourselves at not being outdone at <b>the</b> <b>nightly</b> ball by our less active friends, who had remained at home.|$|E
5|$|None of the shake-ups helped Jennings retake <b>the</b> <b>nightly</b> ratings crown, but World News Tonight still offered stiff {{competition}} at second place. As the millennium approached, Jennings {{and the network}} started preparing for extensive retrospectives of the 20th century. The anchor teamed with former Life magazine journalist Todd Brewster to pen The Century, a 606-page book on 20th-century America. Designed as a companion book for ABC's upcoming documentary series of the same name, the book topped The New York Times Best Seller list in December 1998, a month after it debuted. On March 29, 1999, Jennings anchored the first installment of ABC's 12-hour miniseries, The Century; production on the monumental project started in 1990, {{and by the time}} it aired, it had cost the network $25 million. Jennings also anchored a longer, 15-hour version, , on the History Channel in April 1999.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for <b>the</b> <b>nightly</b> broadcast. He read the news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not {{ready to move on}} to the next news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him into his office and berated him, telling him he did not deserve to be on television and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware that he was going to lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or clepsydrae, were {{commonly}} used in Ancient Greece following their introduction by Plato, who also invented a water-based alarm clock. One account of Plato's alarm clock describes it as depending on <b>the</b> <b>nightly</b> overflow of a vessel containing lead balls, which floated in a columnar vat. The vat held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough to tip over, causing the lead balls to cascade onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the Academy. Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a siphon. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar. There, the rising water would force air through a whistle, sounding an alarm. The Greeks and Chaldeans regularly maintained timekeeping records as {{an essential part of}} their astronomical observations.|$|E
