5|$|Beginning around 1238, {{the castle}} was {{expanded}} to the east, north, and north-west. The work lasted through {{the reign of}} HenryIII and into that of EdwardI, interrupted occasionally by civil unrest. New creations included a new defensive perimeter, studded with towers, while on the west, north, and east sides, where the wall was not defended by the river, a defensive ditch was dug. The eastern extension took the castle beyond <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> the old Roman settlement, marked by the city wall which had been incorporated into the castle's defences. The Tower had long been a symbol of oppression, despised by Londoners, and Henry's building programme was unpopular. So when the gatehouse collapsed in 1240, the locals celebrated the setback. The expansion caused disruption locally and £166 was paid to St Katherine's Hospital and the prior of Holy Trinity in compensation.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Able in 1951 was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} the earliest forming major hurricane– a tropical cyclone with winds exceeding – however following post-storm analysis it was determined that Able only reached Category 1strength which made Hurricane Alma of 1966 the new record holder; as it became a major hurricane on June8.

5|$|In 1876, Frederick Law Olmsted {{was hired}} to survey the Bronx and map out streets based on the local geography.

The land was part of a proposed greenbelt across the Bronx, consisting of parks and parkways that would align more with existing geography than a grid system similar to the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 in Manhattan. That grid had given rise to Central Park, a park with mostly artificial features within <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> the grid. However, in 1877, the city declined to act upon his plan.|$|E

5|$|Newer {{styles of}} play have {{recently}} emerged, pushing <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> what the gandingan was traditionally used for. One type of play called kulndet requires players to perform highly dense, complicated rhythmic patterns upon the gandingan. This type of play unlike the olden (kamamatuan) style of gandingan playing requires assistants {{to hold the}} gongs to avoid long suspensions of sound. Because of the strenuous type of play, male musicians usually perform this style during contests held at weddings where players would demonstrate their virtuosity, considered a sign of masculinity, on the gandingan. During a gandingan contest, two expert gandingan players (pagagandings) would play a particular piece several times in rotation with each other. This type of play {{is said to have}} evolved from the spread of virtousic style on the agung.|$|E
5|$|Roguelike games create random tile-based levels, monster encounters, and {{treasure}} through procedural generation on each new game. Preferably roguelikes {{adhering to the}} Berlin Interpretation use ASCII-based graphics. They may include pre-determined levels as well, such as a town level common to the Moria family where the player can buy and sell equipment. Generated layouts typically incorporate rooms connected by corridors, {{some of which may}} be preset to some degree (e.g., monster lairs or treasuries). Open areas or natural features, such as rivers, may occur, though these are considered against the Berlin Interpretation. While early roguelikes would have levels confined to <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> the terminal screen, other roguelikes enabled a much larger level size, only a portion shown to the player as they moved around it.|$|E
5|$|The 'Beating of the bounds' is {{an ancient}} annual custom first carried out in 1612, which revives the {{traditional}} checking of the sea boundaries awarded to Poole by the Cinque Port of Winchelsea in 1364.

As there are no physical landmarks that can be beaten at sea, traditionally children from Poole were encouraged to remember <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> their town by taking part in the 'Pins and Points' ceremony involving the beating of a boy and pricking of a girl's hand with a needle. In modern times, the acts have been symbolically carried out.|$|E

In early September, Hurricane Fabian struck Bermuda as a Category 3 hurricane, where {{it was the worst}} hurricane since 1926; on the island it caused four deaths and $300million in damage (2003USD, $ USD). Hurricane Juan caused considerable destruction to Nova Scotia, particularly Halifax, as a Category2 hurricane, the first hurricane of significant strength to hit the province since 1893. Additionally, Hurricanes Claudette and Erika struck Texas and Mexico, respectively, as minimal hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|The {{season began}} with Tropical Depression 17F on July 3, several {{months prior to}} the {{official}} start of the season. In late December, the strongest cyclone of the season, Cyclone Zoe severely affected many islands in the South Pacific, particularly the island of Tikopia. Zoe remained the strongest cyclone recorded in the Southern Hemisphere until Winston surpassed. Shortly after, in mid-January, Cyclone Ami struck Fiji as a Category3 cyclone, where it caused US$51.2million in damage. Cyclone Erica caused considerable damage to New Caledonia as a Category4 cyclone, causing numerous power outages. The final storm of the season, Cyclone Gina, formed well outside <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> the conventional tropical cyclone season, existing entirely in the month of June and causing some damage to Tikopia. As a result of tropical cyclones in the 2002–03 season, US$67.2million in damages was caused, along with 20fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{taking his}} seat in the Senate, Crittenden {{was named to the}} Committee on Public Lands and the Committee on the Judiciary, {{probably}} due to Clay's influence. Early in his term, Crittenden vociferously opposed Senator Thomas H. Benton's proposal to spend the federal budget surplus on public land graduation and military fortifications along the eastern seaboard. He also blasted the Jackson administration for issuing the Specie Circular, requiring that all payment for government land be made in gold or silver. He pointed out that the principles of the circular had been presented in a resolution on the Senate floor, but had been tabled by a large majority. Crittenden maintained that the tabling of the resolution was a condemnation by the Senate, yet the administration issued the circular only months later, overstepping, as Crittenden saw it, <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> the executive branch's authority. Crittenden debated the issue at length with Senator Benton, and Congress ultimately passed a bill requiring the government to accept the notes of specie-paying banks for the purchase of government lands, but President Jackson employed his pocket veto to prevent it from becoming law.|$|E
