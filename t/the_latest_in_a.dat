5|$|The {{game was}} <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of efforts by Nintendo {{to break into}} the North American market. Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo's {{president}} at the time, assigned the project to a first-time video game designer named Shigeru Miyamoto. Drawing {{from a wide range of}} inspirations, including Popeye, Beauty and the Beast, and King Kong, Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game alongside Nintendo's chief engineer, Gunpei Yokoi. The two men broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization, including cutscenes to advance the game's plot, and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The season premiered at the Pacific Design Center on January 26, 2017, {{ahead of}} its FX debut on February 8. It ran for eight episodes, until March 29. The season {{received}} critical acclaim for its cast, particularly Stevens; Hawley's visuals and design; and the nonlinear, unreliable nature of the storytelling. Several critics did note that the latter aspects would not be for all viewers, and some criticized this as just <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> trend of series with unreliable narratives. Legion was renewed for a second season on March 15, 2017.|$|E

30|$|The RAS plays <b>an</b> {{important}} role <b>in</b> {{the pathogenesis of}} ARDS; in particular, it {{can be considered as}} <b>an</b> important element <b>in</b> the inflammatory response, since angiotensin II acts as a growth factor regulating cell growth and fibrosis [3]. The ACE 2 /Ang-(1 - 7) axis exerts protective effects in several pathological scenarios in different organs, by opposing the overactivation of ACE/Ang-II axis [19].

The case challenges the Military Commissions system’s suitability as a habeas corpus substitute and the legality, in general, of detention at Guantanamo. It was consolidated under Boumediene v.

25|$|Although {{antagonism}} {{about the}} expense of Byzantine domination had long persisted within Italy, the political rupture was set in motion in earnest in 726 by the iconoclasm of Emperor Leo III the Isaurian. The exarch was lynched while trying to enforce the iconoclastic edict and Pope Gregory II saw iconoclasm as <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of imperial heresies. In 731, his successor, Pope Gregory III organized a synod in Rome (attended by the Archbishop of Ravenna), which declared iconoclasm punishable by excommunication. When the exarch donated six columns of onyx to the shrine of St. Peter in thanks for the pope's assistance in his release from the Lombards, Gregory III defiantly had the material crafted into icons.|$|E
25|$|With Gallucci's {{prestige}} {{beginning to}} wither, he scrambled {{to maintain control}} as the war continued with the remnants of Prisco's old gang.

Being a bodyguard for Gallucci was considered an unsafe way to make a living, as ten of them had been killed. The year before, Gallucci was wounded and two of his bodyguards were killed when he tried to make a collection in a shop on First Avenue. Meanwhile, the Morello gang had fallen out with Gallucci and had formed an alliance with the Camorra gangs from Brooklyn.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that any of these assumptions are correct, or even likely. Linguistic opinion is that click consonants may well be a relatively late development in human language, that they are no more resistant to change or any more likely to be linguistic relics than other speech sounds, and that they are easily borrowed: at least one Khoisan language, ǁXegwi, is believed to have reborrowed clicks from Bantu languages, which had earlier borrowed them from Khoisan languages, for example. The Knight and Mountain article is <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> long line of speculations about the primitive origin of click consonants, which have been largely motivated by the outdated idea that primitive people speak primitive languages, which has no empirical support.|$|E
25|$|Takembeng mobilizations are <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{long history}} of female mobilizations in the Western grassfields of Cameroon. Sociologist Susan Diduk divides these mobilizations into three {{different}} periods (with prior forms continuing to exist in later periods). The first period of women exercising moral guardianship involved women in rural communities mobilizing to shame individuals who violated key community moral standards. A second period involved women from multiple communities connecting with one another to protest colonial and post-independence policies, primarily agricultural, from the 1950s on. Takembeng is the name for mobilizations which begun in the early 1990s and often took place with the opposition party to the government, the Social Democratic Front (SDF). Some sources claim that Takembeng is a long-standing practice in Ngemba communities {{and that it does}} not grow from the practices in the various communities.|$|E

His third solo record Paris 1919 (1973) steered back towards the singer-songwriter mode with a backing band that included Lowell George of Little Feat and Wilton Felder of The Crusaders. Made up of songs with arcane and complex lyrics, it has been cited by critics {{as one of his}} best. While affiliated with the label, he produced albums by Jennifer Warnes (her third, Jennifer), Chunky, Novi & Ernie, and the self-titled debut of The Modern Lovers, which Reprise chose not to release; it subsequently appeared on Beserkley Records, <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of important Cale-produced proto-punk records. In 1974 he joined Island Records, working on albums with a variety of artists, including Squeeze, Patti Smith and Sham 69. He also worked as a talent scout with Island's A department.|$|E

It is <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ongoing research effort to develop real-world vision systems based on cable-drive transmissions. The head {{presented in this paper}} is the laboratory’s first fully cable-driven binocular rig, and builds on several successful aspects of previous monocular prototypes. Namely, an increased payload capacity, a more compact transmission, and a design optimised for rigidity. In addition, we have developed a simple and compact controller for real-time tracking applications. It consists of two behavioural subgroups, saccade and smooth pursuit. By using a single trapezoidal profile motion (TPM) algorithm, we show that saccade time and motion smoothness can be optimised...|$|R
