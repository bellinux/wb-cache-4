5|$|In March 2010 the Secretary of State for Transport, Andrew Adonis {{announced}} that Euston was the preferred southern terminus {{of the proposed}} High Speed 2 line, which would connect to a newly-built station near Curzon Street and Fazeley Street in Birmingham. This would require expansion to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>west</b> to create new sufficiently long platforms. These plans involved a complete reconstruction, involving the demolition of 220 Camden Council flats, with half the station providing conventional train services and the new half high-speed trains.
