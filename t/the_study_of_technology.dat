40|$|Most {{scholarship}} on media technologies can be organized along two main dimensions of inquiry: the production or consumption <b>of</b> these <b>technologies,</b> and their content or material dimensions. This {{map of the}} field of inquiry would produce four specific research areas: the production of content, the consumption of content, the production of materiality, and the consumption of materiality. Despite their respective contributions, these silos have also resulted in important scholarly limitations. Thus, in this paper, we consider the intellectual opportunities that arise from reevaluating these traditions through the lens of cosmopolitanism, which promotes the crossing of scholarly territories in <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> media <b>technologies</b> in order to rethink assumptions and taken-for-granted processes. We propose some steps toward cosmopolitanism in <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> media <b>technologies</b> by elaborating on the theoretical, methodological, pedagogical, and design implications of conducting research at the intersection of these four areas.

40|$|Focusing on {{the ontological}} {{principles}} of practice, the paper advances an activity-based theory of socio- technical entanglement. The paper aims to make three contributions to theory. Firstly, by examining how theories of practices have been conceptualized and analytically deployed in <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> sociomateriality, <b>the</b> paper provides important insights concerning the ontological status {{of practice and}} its implications for techno- organizational research. Secondly, by explicating how Schatzki’s treatment of practices differs form alternative approaches and how its use may be advantageous in <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> socio-technical entanglements, <b>the</b> paper challenges the assumption that an activity theory does not lend itself for <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> in organizing. Thirdly, by extending Schatzki’s theory <b>of</b> practice to <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> techno-organizational phenomena, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> offers a novel application of an activity theory. Whilst promoting one view of practice, the paper also acknowledges that this is but one theory and that diversity of approaches is warranted and indeed desirable. The purpose here is to enrich rather than seek conceptual closure for <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> socio-technical phenomena...|$|R

Volunteer research participants individually live in the PlaceLab for days or weeks at a time, treating it as a temporary home. Meanwhile, sensing devices integrated {{into the fabric of}} the architecture record a detailed description of their activities. The facility generates sensor and observational datasets {{that can be used for}} research in ubiquitous computing and other fields where domestic contexts impact behavior. We describe some of our experiences constructing and operating the living laboratory, and we detail a recently generated sample dataset, available online to researchers. ...|$|R
