50|$|Early reports, {{published}} in the late 19th century, describe patients with acute onset of deafness after experiencing symptoms described as apoplexy. The only means of definitive diagnosis in these reports were postmortem dissections. Subsequent cases throughout the 20th century reflect advancements in diagnoses of both hearing loss and stroke. With the advent of audiometric and electrophysiologic studies, investigators could diagnose cortical deafness with increasing precision. Advances in imaging techniques, such as MRI, greatly improved the diagnosis and localization of cerebral infarcts that coincide with primary or secondary auditory centers. Neurological and cognitive testing help to distinguish between <b>total</b> cortical <b>deafness</b> and auditory agnosia, resulting in the inability to perceive words, music, or specific environmental sounds.|$|R

The consonants /b/, /p/, /m/, /v/, /f/, /d/, /t/,/n/, /z/, /s/, /g/, /k/ {{were presented in}} VCV context with the vowel /a/ as in father by a male and female speaker under three conditions: lipreading alone; electrical stimulation alone using the wearable speech processor and multiple-channel cochlear implant; lipreading in conjunction with electrical stimulation. No significant difference was detected between {{the results for the}} male and female speakers. The percentage correct scores for the pooled results of both speakers were lipreading alone - 30 %; electrical stimulation alone - 48 %; lipreading with electrical simulation - 70 %. Performance was significantly better for lipreading with electrical stimulation than for lipreading alone and for electrical stimulation alone than for lipreading alone. An information transmission analysis demonstrated the effective integration of visual and auditory information for lipreading with electrical stimulation. There was a significant improvement in performance for the electrical stimulation alone condition over the 2 months of the study in contrast to no such improvement for lipreading alone.

60|$|At a {{very early}} date of her sojourn with Valentine, it was {{discovered}} that her <b>total</b> <b>deafness</b> did not entirely exclude her from every effect of sound.

For example, if Mr. Blyth wished to bring her to his side when they were together in the painting-room, and when she happened neither to be looking at him nor to be within reach of a touch he used to rub his foot, or the end of his mahl-stick gently against the floor. The slight concussion so produced, reached her nerves instantly; provided always that some part of her body touched the floor on which such experiments were tried.|$|E
60|$|Gave Mr. Gibson my father's cabinet, which suits {{a man of}} {{business}} well. Gave Jock Stevenson the picture of my old favourite dog Camp, mentioned {{in one of the}} introductions to Marmion, and a little crow-quill drawing of Melrose Abbey by Nelson, whom I used to call the Admiral. Poor fellow! he had some ingenuity, and was, in a moderate way, a good penman and draughtsman. He left his situation of amanuensis to go into Lord Home's militia regiment, but his dissipated habits got the better of a strong constitution, and he fell into bad ways and poverty, and died, I believe, in the hospital at Liverpool. Strange enough that Henry Weber, who acted afterwards as my amanuensis for many years, had also a melancholy fate ultimately. He was a man of very superior attainments, an excellent linguist and geographer, and a remarkable antiquary. He published a collection of ancient Romances, superior, I think, to the elaborate Ritson. He also published an edition of Beaumont and Fletcher, but too carelessly done to be reputable. He was a violent Jacobin, which he thought he disguised from me, while I, who cared not a fig about the poor young man's politics, used to amuse myself with teasing him. He was an excellent and affectionate creature, but unhappily was afflicted with partial insanity, especially if he used strong liquors, to which, like others with that unhappy tendency, he was occasionally addicted. In 1814[214] he became quite insane, and, at the risk of my life, I had to disarm him of a pair of loaded pistols, which I did by exerting the sort of authority which, I believe, gives an effectual control in such cases. His friends, who were respectable, placed him in the York Asylum, where he pined away and died, I think, in 1814 or 1815.[215] My patronage in this way has not been lucky to the parties protected. I hope poor George Huntly Gordon will escape the influence of the evil star. He has no vice, poor fellow, but his <b>total</b> <b>deafness</b> makes him helpless.|$|E
40|$|Direction-specific {{interactions}} of sound waves with the head, torso and pinna provide unique spectral-shape cues {{that are used}} for the localization of sounds in the vertical plane, whereas horizontal sound localization is based primarily on the processing of binaural acoustic differences in arrival time (interaural time differences, or ITDs) and sound level (interaural level differences, or ILDs). Because the binaural sound-localization cues are absent in listeners with <b>total</b> single-sided <b>deafness</b> (SSD), their ability to localize sound is heavily impaired. However, some studies have reported that SSD listeners are able, to some extent, to localize sound sources in azimuth, although the underlying mechanisms used for localization are unclear. To investigate whether SSD listeners rely on monaural pinna-induced spectral-shape cues of their hearing ear for directional hearing, we investigated localization performance for low-pass filtered (LP, 3 kHz) and broadband (BB, 0. 5 – 20 kHz) noises in the two-dimensional frontal hemifield. We tested whether localization performance of SSD listeners further deteriorated when the pinna cavities of their hearing ear were filled with a mold that disrupted their spectral-shape cues. To remove the potential use of perceived sound level as an invalid azimuth cue, we randomly varied stimulus presentation levels over a broad range (45 - 65 dB SPL). Several listeners with SSD could localize HP and BB sound sources in the horizontal plane, but inter-subject variability was considerable. Localization performance of these listeners strongly reduced after diminishing of their spectral pinna-cues. We further show that inter-subject variability of SSD can be explained {{to a large extent}} by the severity of high-frequency hearing loss in their hearing ear...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{describe}} a rare case of central auditory dysfunction induced by cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A 55 -year-old {{woman who was}} admitted after aneurysmal SAH developed cerebral vasospasm on Day 3 affecting mainly the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) and partly the left MCA. The vasospasm became refractory to conventional therapy and was ultimately improved by intraarterial infusion of nimodipine in the right MCA and angioplasty. Severe auditory dysfunction was apparent from Day 10 as the patient was not reactive to speech or environmental sounds. Brain MRI on Day 17 demonstrated infarcted areas mainly in the right hippocampus, medial occipital lobe, and thalamus. The patient underwent further examination using audiometry, speech testing, auditory evoked potentials, functional MRI, and cerebral PET. The initial diagnosis was extended nonverbal agnosia and <b>total</b> pure word <b>deafness.</b> The central auditory dysfunction improved over 6 months, with persisting hyperacusis, tinnitus, and amusia. Central auditory dysfunction is a rare complication after SAH. While cortical deafness {{may be associated with}} bilateral lesions of the temporal cortex, partly reversible central auditory dysfunction was observed in this patient after prominently unilateral right temporal lesions. The role of the interthalamic connections can be discussed, as well as the possibility that a less severe vasospasm on the left MCA could have transiently impaired the left thalamocortical auditory pathways...|$|R
40|$|Background: India is a {{significant}} contributor to the world&#x 2032;s <b>total</b> burden of <b>deafness.</b> Out of all causes, almost 50 &#x 0025; {{of the causes of}} decreased hearing are preventable. With the launch of the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Deafness, the need for an effective information, education and communication (IEC) campaign was felt. There is negligible information available about the status of awareness levels of the community about the various aspects of hearing loss. We carried out this research with the objective of getting to know the existing awareness related to hearing loss in the community to generate an evidence base for formulating various messages to be incorporated in IEC materials for dissemination in the community. We also asked the participants about their suggestions for the various information resources so that an IEC campaign could be designed accordingly. Materials and Methods: We carried out 10 focus group discussions among various groups of population and analyzed the discussion. Results: A descriptive analysis of the observations regarding the awareness about deafness in the community and prevalent myths and suggested information resources is presented. Conclusion: We highlight the lacunae in the existing awareness of various causes of deafness and the preventive measures that could be taken to prevent hearing loss. The evidence generated was used to formulate relevant messages for the various target groups, which were then incorporated in development of the IEC materials for the dissemination in the community...|$|R

40|$|Background: National {{guidelines}} for aetiologic investigation of childhood deafness were developed as the Newborn Hearing Screening Program (NHSP) was being {{implemented in the}} United Kingdom.

Method: This criterion-based audit compared local care set against developed guidelines {{that can be used to}} assess the appropriateness of specific investigations, services and outcomes. Data on children diagnosed to have sensorineural deafness from March 2002 - 2004 were extracted from an established computerized database for analysis. Results: Forty-seven children were included; 17 have bilateral severe to profound hearing loss, 25 have bilateral mild to moderate loss and 5 with unilateral loss. A high proportion of Pakistani children were from consanguineous marriages with a family history of <b>deafness.</b> <b>Total</b> 29. 8 % of children were diagnosed through newborn screening and 70. 2 % detected through hearing surveillance programmes. For children with bilateral severe to profound deafness, 53. 0 % accepted, 5. 9 % declined and 41. 2 % were not offered imaging of their inner ears. A total of 47. 1 % accepted and 52. 9 % declined electrocardiograph (ECG) evaluation. Total 70. 6 % accepted and 29. 4 % declined connexin mutations testing. Parental requests were required for those with lesser degree of hearing loss. Total 24 % accepted, 28 % declined and 48 % were not offered connexin testing. None were offered ECG and imaging. Testing for congenital infections was inappropriate for children over 1 year old. Ten subjects accepted and five declined this investigation. In the total group, 63. 8 % accepted, 17. 0 % declined and 19. 1 % were not offered referral to the ophthalmic service. Total 46. 8 % accepted, 44. 7 % declined and 8. 5 % were not offered referral to genetics service. Investigations resulted in two connexin-positive children with moderate loss. Conclusion: Our study identified key areas where guidelines were not followed. These were related to lack of funding and parental choice.

50|$|In {{cases where}} the causes are environmental, the {{treatment}} is to eliminate or reduce these causes first of all, and then to fit patients with a hearing aid, {{especially if they are}} elderly.

On the one hand, persons who experience gradual deterioration of their hearing are fortunate in that they have learned to speak.

They decided to combine these skills and form a multidisciplinary team within the ENT Research Laboratory at Saint-Antoine University Hospital in Paris. In 1975, they performed a fully ethical study on three patients with recent traumatic unilateral <b>total</b> <b>deafness</b> and total facial paralysis, which required surgery.
