5000|$|When {{the pilot}} [...] "arms" [...] the system (prior to capture {{of either the}} {{localizer}} or glideslope) the flight control computers perform an extensive series of Built In Tests (BIT). For a CAT III landing, all the sensors and all the flight computers must be [...] "in good health" [...] before the pilot receives an AUTOLAND ARM (These are generic indications and will vary depending on equipment supplier and aircraft manufacturer) indication. If {{part of the system}} is in error, then an indication such as [...] "APPROACH ONLY" [...] would be presented to inform the flight crew that a CAT III landing is not possible. If the system is properly in the ARM mode, when the ILS receiver detects the localizer, then the autoland system mode will change to 'LOCALIZER CAPTURE' and the flight control computer will turn the aircraft into the localizer and fly along the localizer. A typical approach will have the aircraft come in [...] "below the glideslope" [...] (vertical guidance) so the airplane will fly along the localizer (aligned to the runway centerline) until the glideslope is detected at which point the autoland mode will change to CAT III and the aircraft will be flown by the flight control computer along the localizer and glideslope beams. The antennas for these systems are not at the runway touch down point however, with the localizer being some distance beyond the runway.

40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} today is a heavily regulated segment, and current standard hasestablished restrictions which yields a very limited weather window for offshore cable installations. This is due to experience with cable failure in harsh weather. A limiting factor in current practice is the design criterion for the minimum allowable radius of curvature in the touchdown point. In addition, current practice does not allow for occurrence of compression in the <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> <b>zone,</b> since this is associated with loop formation and loss of the functionality of the cable. The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate the validity and conservatism of current practice, by investigating the issues related to torsion instability through a proposed design procedure. The scope of the thesis comprehends numerical analyses using the SINTEF OCEAN developed software SIMLA. The numerical studies concern a J-lay installation scenario at 100 meters water depth with an implemented cable laying vessel with realistic RAO properties. Two real-life cable cross-sections are evaluated; a single-layered cable without armoring (umbilical 1) and a torsional balanced cable with double-armoring (umbilical 2). The mechanical properties of these are calculated analytically, where the main differences lay in the torsional stiffness of the cross-sections. The effect of installation route is evaluated, and two scenarios are simulated; an end cap turn and a curved route to avoid obstacles. The results are obtained in two steps. Primarily, the critical values of torsion momentand resultant curvature with respect to loop formation are established. These parameters are determined for both a linear and a non-linear pipe material model. Subsequently a range of dynamic analyses with irregular waves are carried out. The irregular waves are applied using a Pierson-Moskowitz wave spectrum with Hs= 2 − 3 mandTp= 7 − 10 s with a one hour simulation time. In the dynamic analyses, the torsion moment and curvature in the cable are analyzed and compared with the capacity parameters for each scenario. For umbilical 1 it is found that the maximum resultant curvature for all sea states exceeds the critical API curvature, while the torsion moment is below the critical torsion moment. The sea states can, due to excess of the API criterion, not be classified as acceptable. It is also concluded that a contributing factor is the low magnitude of the horizontal bottom tension. The maximum resultant curvature for umbilical 2 oscillates around curvature values below the design criterion for minimum radius of curvature for all sea states. The torsion moments are lower than the critical torsion moment. All seastates for umbilical 2 are categorized as acceptable with respect to experienced resultant curvature. It is in addition investigated whether the cables experience compression in the <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> <b>zone</b> while subjected to irregular waves. For umbilical 1 it is found that compression occurs inthe <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> <b>zone</b> for all sea states for both installation scenarios. Umbilical 2 experiences compression in varying degree for all sea states except for Hs= 2 m,Tp= 7 s. The magnitude of the compressive axial force is increasing in accordance with increasing wave height andperiod. The magnitude of the compressive axial forces experienced are compared with the buckling loads associated with local helix buckling and birdcaging. None of the force values are within the range for the buckling loads for tensile armour buckling. Hence it can be concluded that its possible with occurrence of compression without necessarily associated kink formation nor local buckling. The effect of wave heading is also investigated. Changing the wave heading impacts the maximum resultant curvature. It is found that the most critical scenario occur when the waves are incoming with a heading of [π, 2 π]. This is due to the cable configuration, which experience a slight bend in the <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> <b>zone</b> at the initiation of the dynamics. It is also carried out a study of the effect of additional sea current. A current velocity of 4 m/s with correspondingly heading of 0 °, 90 °, 180 °, 270 ° is applied. This result in the observation that the most critical scenario is a current heading of 180 ° due to reduction of the cable effective weight. It is investigated whether a too low horizontal bottom tension is the reason of the severe curvature levels for umbilical 1. Analyses with a T 0 = 5 kN are run for the respective sea states. Resulting from this the curvature levels for umbilical 1 is lowered to acceptable levels for Hs= 2 m. The same analyses are carried out for umbilical 2, where the resulting curvatures increase compared to lower initial tension. This is due to severe yielding of the friction moment for the case of T 0 = 5 kN, inducing more severe deformation of the cable...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{design of a}} deep draft wet tree semi-submersible with steel catenary risers (SCRs) for 4, 000 ft water depth in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). The integrated system of hull, mooring, and SCRs is discussed. The design challenges of SCRs are highlighted and results of SCR strength and fatigue performance are presented. A comparison study on strength performance of various types of risers under the GoM environment criteria is performed. The assessment of extreme strength responses from various riser and hull configurations provide guidelines for the best hull selection. Sour service requirement creates challenges in the fatigue design of the production riser system at such water depth. Integrated mooring and riser design provides an optimum solution. It’s found {{that the majority of}} riser fatigue damage at <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> <b>zone</b> is generated by wave loading & resultant vessel motion and vortex induced vessel motion (VIM).

40|$|Uncertainty and {{representativity}} of meteorological observations {{depend on}} the terrain roughness {{in the vicinity of}} the observation sites. The measure of representativity also depends on the wind direction. In particular at airports, where local representativity is strong requirement, it is of high importance to have a good view on the windfield at and above the runways, and also in the approach zones. The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute uses two methods to transform the measured windspeed to values representative for the surrounding areas, especially to the area above <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> <b>zone.</b> The first method is based on the influence of the roughness on the vertical wind velocity profile. The roughness around the observation site is calculated using a gust analysis as a function of wind direction. For a well qualified statistical analysis providing roughness data, a long term time series of windspeed data is required. The second method is based on a rough visual estimation of the shelter factor using a classification scheme describing the landscape. Every classification correspondends with a value of the shelter factor. These methods give the tools make it possible to present required wind information to the airtraffic.

40|$|Steel {{catenary}} risers (SCRs) in deepwater environment exhibit complex dynamic dynamic response {{governed by}} various {{factors such as}} environmental conditions, vessel motions, soil-structure interaction and material degradation. Uncertainties in the SCR design exist in the design data, analysis methodologies, fabrication, and hence a conservative approach has been adopted to overcome these shortfalls. Recent advances in monitoring systems installed on SCRs provide operator the assurance of the integrity of the SCRs in service, verify the SCR design, and enhance basic understanding of the SCR response. This paper outlines a strategy for monitoring the SCRs to characterize the response due to vessel motions, vortex induced vibrations (VIV), and soil-structure interaction. A detailed example of real-time SCR monitoring system with optimized array of motion and strain measurements is presented. The methodology for sensor selection and optimization is based on linear regression analysis. The measured data processing methods include shape matching the response amplitudes with correlating response frequencies. The principles and methods of measured data interpretation to capture global response shape due to wave and vessel motions induced and VIV are presented. The pipe-soil interaction such as soil stiffness, suction, softening and trenching effects characterized using the strain measurements in the <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> <b>zone</b> are presented.

40|$|With {{oil and gas}} {{reserves}} moving into deeper waters Floating Production Units (FPUs) {{have been widely used}} for production purpose. Selection of FPU for deepwater field development is a complicated task is mainly governed by factors like water depth, location of field (remoteness), environmental conditions, deck space requirements, storage requirements and offloading requirements etc. Amongst all the available FPU alternatives ship shaped FPSO has undoubtedly dominated the concept selection and are generally used in marginal and remote fields lacking pipeline infrastructure. Selecting riser concept for FPSO stationed in deepwater has posed challenges due high hydrostatic pressure and large vessel payload. The condition is worsened if besides deepwater, FPSO is also stationed in harsh environmental conditions. Under such conditions FPSO is subjected to large offsets and dynamics which are directly transferred along the riser length to its base unless riser is uncoupled from the FPSO. One of the major factors governing the riser concept selection for deepwater FPSO is the geographical location and weather conditions prevalent there. For example free hanging flexible riser has been mostly used in moderate environments of offshore Brazil while concepts like Steel Catenary Riser (SCR) and Hybrid Riser Tower (HRT) are dominant in calm weather conditions of West of Africa (WoA). Flexible risers in various configurations are currently the most widely used concept with turret moored FPSO in water depth up to 1500 m. This can be accounted to their flexibility which allows them to accommodate large vessel offsets and also to be spooled on reels/carrousels for storage and installation purposes. But other factors like requirement of large diameter to increase collapse resistance, tendency to birdcage, large cost and increased weight limits its use beyond 2000 m. For past decade on of the alternatives to flexible riser for spread moored FPSO in deepwater benign environments has been SCR. SCR is not only a cheaper option but also permits use of large diameter sizes as required to withstand high hydrostatic pressure at larger depths. However SCRs are yet to find its application with deepwater FPSO in moderate to harsh environments due to their reduced fatigue life at hang-off and <b>Touch</b> <b>Down</b> <b>Zone</b> (TDZ). One way of improving the fatigue life of SCR is by changing the riser configuration from catenary to wave shaped (SLWR) by adding buoyancy to it and such a configuration is installed with turret moored FPSO (1780 m) in offshore Brazil. Two overcome the disadvantage of coupled riser systems like SCR, un-coupled riser concepts namely Hybrid Riser Tower (HRT), Single Hybrid Riser (SHR) and Buoyancy Supported Riser (BSR) have been installed. Fairly new un-coupled riser concepts like Grouped Single Line Offset Riser (SLOR), Catenary Offset Buoyant Riser Assembly (COBRA) and Tethered Catenary Riser (TCR) are being studied and developed for deepwater application. Till date there is no FPSO stationed in water depths exceeding 1000 m in Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). Case study is performed at the end of thesis with the aim of recommending suitable riser concept which can be hooked to internal turret moored FPSO stationed in 1500 m water depth and harsh environmental conditions of Northern Norwegian Sea. Based on the literature review lazy wave configuration of flexible riser and Steel Lazy Wave Riser (SLWR) have been considered as a viable riser concept. Main aim of this case study is to compare the two riser concepts on basis of vessel payload, fabrication cost and installation cost while the scope of study involves preforming static, dynamic and fatigue analysis of both the riser systems by using Orcaflex. At the end of thesis an effort has been made to come up with suitable conclusions and recommendations based on the work done in this thesis...|$|E
