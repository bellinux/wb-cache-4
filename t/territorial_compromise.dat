500|$|Poland was {{attacked}} in 1487–1491 by {{remnants of the}} Golden Horde that invaded Poland as far as Lublin before being beaten at Zaslavl. In 1497, King John Albert [...] made an attempt to resolve the Turkish problem militarily, but his efforts were unsuccessful; {{he was unable to}} secure effective participation in the war by his brothers, King Vladislas (Władysław) II of Bohemia and Hungary and Alexander, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, and he also faced resistance on the part of Stephen the Great, the ruler of Moldavia. More destructive Tatar raids instigated by the Ottoman Empire took place in 1498, 1499 and 1500. Diplomatic peace efforts initiated by John Albert were finalized after the king's death in 1503.

500|$|After {{the death}} of Władysław I, the old monarch's 23-year-old son became King Casimir III, later known as Casimir the Great (r. 1333–1370). Unlike his father, the new king {{demonstrated}} no attraction for the hardships of military life. [...] Casimir's contemporaries did not give him {{much of a chance}} of overcoming the country's mounting difficulties or succeeding as a ruler. But from the beginning, Casimir acted prudently, and in 1335, he purchased the claims of King John of Bohemia to the Polish throne. [...] In 1343, Casimir settled several high-level arbitration disputes with the Teutonic Order by a <b>territorial</b> <b>compromise</b> that culminated in the Treaty of Kalisz of 1343. Dobrzyń Land and Kuyavia were recovered by Casimir. At that time, Poland started to expand to the east and through a series of military campaigns between 1340 and 1366, Casimir annexed the Halych–Volodymyr area of Rus'. The town of Lviv there attracted newcomers of several nationalities, was granted municipal rights in 1356, and had thus begun its career as Lwów, the main Polish center {{in the midst of a}} Rus' Orthodox population. Supported by Hungary, the Polish king in 1338 promised the Hungarian ruling house the Polish throne in the event he dies without male heirs.|$|E

As communications minister, he earned popularity by taking on Israel's wireless cartel and forcing them to lower mobile phone prices by introducing new competitors. His platform aims to break up business monopolies and lower the high cost of living. Traditionally known for a hard line on security matters, Kahlon has in more recent times suggested support for <b>territorial</b> <b>compromise</b> for a two-state solution.

2500|$|The Palestinian negotiators {{indicated}} they wanted full Palestinian sovereignty {{over the entire}} West Bank and the Gaza Strip, although they would consider a one-to-one land swap with Israel. Their historic position was that Palestinians had already made a <b>territorial</b> <b>compromise</b> with Israel by accepting Israel's right to 78% of [...] "historic Palestine", and accepting their state on the remaining 22% of such land. This consensus was expressed by Faisal Husseini when he remarked:'There can be no compromise on the compromise'. They maintained that Resolution 242 calls for full Israeli withdrawal from these territories, which were captured in the Six-Day War, {{as part of a}} final peace settlement. In the 1993 Oslo Accords the Palestinian negotiators accepted the Green Line borders (1949 armistice lines) for the West Bank but the Israelis rejected this proposal and disputed the Palestinian interpretation of Resolution 242. Israel wanted to annex the numerous settlement blocks on the Palestinian side of the Green Line, and were concerned that a complete return to the 1967 borders was dangerous to Israel's security. The Palestinian and Israeli definition of the West Bank differs by approximately 5% land area as the Israeli definition does not include East Jerusalem (71km²), the territorial waters of the Dead Sea (195km²) and the area known as No Man's Land (50km2 near Latrun).|$|E

2500|$|This is in {{accordance}} with the principle of the two-state solution, first proposed in the 1980s. The mainstream within the PLO have taken the concept of <b>territorial</b> and diplomatic <b>compromise</b> seriously and have showed serious interest in this. During the 2010 talks, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said that the Palestinians and Israel have agreed on the principle of a land swap, but Israel has yet to confirm. The issue of the ratio of land Israel would give to the Palestinians in exchange for keeping settlement blocs is an issue of dispute, with the Palestinians demanding that the ratio be 1:1, and Israel offering less. In April 2012, Mahmoud Abbas sent a letter to Benjamin Netanyahu reiterating that for peace talks to resume, Israel must stop settlement building in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and accept the 1967 borders as a basis for a two-state solution. In May 2012, Abbas reiterated his readiness to engage with the Israelis if they propose [...] "anything promising or positive". Netanyahu replied to Abbas' April letter less than a week later and, for the first time, officially recognised the right for Palestinians to have their own state, though as before he declared {{it would have to be}} demilitarised, and said his new national unity government furnished a new opportunity to renew negotiations and move forward.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{theoretical}} in nature, {{falling into the}} field of political economy. It provides a theoretical analysis of two hitherto underappreciated principles of political organisation: unbundling the functions of government and devolving responsibilities to non-territorial jurisdictions. This is motivated by inherent limitations of bundled, territorially monopolistic governance. Political economists {{are well aware of}} how majoritarian democratic decision-making necessitates various conflicts and <b>compromises.</b> <b>Territorial</b> decentralisation also bears efficiency limitations because its sorting mechanism requires citizens sacrifice economic and social preferences to satisfy political preferences. Political bundling generates trade-offs that impede preference satisfaction when the bundles offered do not conform to preferences over the fully suite of policies. The theory of unbundled and non-territorial governance is analysed as a means to overcoming these problems. Economic theory from multiple schools (i. e., new institutional, public choice, Austrian) are used to find that greater efficiency and citizen welfare follows from non-territorial unbundling, and clarify the conditions under which it might ever eventuate. The history of these ideas in political-economic thought are traced, and past and contemporary cases of non-territorial unbundling are uncovered. The &lsquo;pure&rsquo; version of the theory has yet to fully arise in practice, but emerging examples of cryptographic &lsquo;virtual states&rsquo; come close to realising non-territorial unbundled forms of political organisation. Next the &lsquo;political-jurisdictional Coase theorem&rsquo; is used to describe how political systems and jurisdictions change. It is the relative imposition of transaction cost over different modes of jurisdictional change as well as wealth effects that enable or prevent non-territorial unbundling. In addition the &lsquo;political-jurisdictional possibilities frontier&rsquo; describes the space of possible allocations of property rights and political authority, given the prevalence of market, political, and jurisdictional transaction costs; and the &lsquo;political-jurisdictional transformation frontier&rsquo; shows the compact trajectory of actual allocations that obtain, given the prevalence of ideas, interests, and wealth effects. Together these explain the conditions of possible emergence or implementation of non-territorial unbundling. A model of partial internal exit captures the competitive dynamic between incumbent and potential governments in a non-territorial unbundled system. This model particularly applies to &lsquo;cryptosecession&rsquo; which appears the most likely avenue for non-territorial unbundling. Fiscal exploitation is reduced and eventually eliminated as the capability of citizens to move to non-territorial and unbundled jurisdictions increases. As a model of cryptosecession, the balance of citizen opacity and government legibility determines the balance of fiscal exploitation versus equivalence. Follwing Austro-evolutionary theory, the &# 039;knowledge problem of the nation-state&rsquo; is the task of designing a political-jurisdictional order given that requisite knowledge is dispersed throughout a polity. Redrawing borders or executing population transfers have proven failures in rational constructivist planning. Conversely, spontaneously ordered political jurisdictions is the general solution to the knowledge problem of the nation-state, which is termed a &lsquo;constellaxy. &rsquo; The pure theory of non-territorial unbundling resembles to a constellaxy, {{and in the absence of}} a constitutional mechanism, a solution can be found in technologies of cryptosecession. While speculative in nature, such discussions are necessary to advance the quality of governance and meet with the challenges of an increasingly complex future...|$|R

50|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Rabbi Kook, with its center in the yeshiva founded by his father, Jerusalem's Mercaz HaRav, thousands of Orthodox Jews campaigned actively against <b>territorial</b> <b>compromise,</b> and established numerous settlements throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

50|$|However, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of Israelis, left and right, including political parties supporting the West Bank settlement movement, feared that such a solution would significantly dilute Israel's Jewish majority.

5000|$|When Begin {{finally came}} to power in the 1977 election, his {{overriding}} concern as Prime Minister (1977-83) was to maintain Israeli control over the West Bank and Gaza.

[...] One of the main mechanisms for accomplishing this objective was the establishment of Jewish settlements. Under Labour governments, between 1967 and 1977, the Jewish population of the territories reached 3,200; Labour's limited settlement activity was predicated upon making a future <b>territorial</b> <b>compromise</b> when the majority of the territory would be returned to Arab control. By contrast, the Likud's settlement plan aimed to settle 750,000 Jews all over the territories in order to prevent a <b>territorial</b> <b>compromise.</b> As a result, by 1984, there were about 44,000 settlers outside East Jerusalem.|$|E

50|$|The {{influence}} of the Jagiellonian dynasty in Central Europe {{had been on the}} rise. In 1471 Casimir's son Władysław became a king of Bohemia, and in 1490 also of Hungary. The southern and eastern outskirts of Poland and Lithuania became threatened by Turkish invasions beginning in the late 15th century. Moldavia's involvement with Poland goes back to 1387, when Petru I, Hospodar of Moldavia, seeking protection against the Hungarians, paid Jagiełło homage in Lviv, which gave Poland access to the Black Sea ports. In 1485 King Casimir undertook an expedition into Moldavia, after its seaports were overtaken by the Ottoman Turks. The Turkish controlled Crimean Tatars raided the eastern territories in 1482 and 1487, until they were confronted by King Jan Olbracht (John Albert), Casimir's son and successor.

International recognition simultaneously increases support for partition as a strategy of conflict resolution and decreases support for compromise on the ter-ritorial terms of partition. We also suggest a logic to explain these impacts of inter-national recognition based on the intuition that international recognition should improve the bargaining position of the newly recognized group.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{examined}} Palestinians’ readiness to compromise over thekey {{issues of the}} Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In contrast to existing opinion poll results the claim that Palestinians support a <b>territorial</b> <b>compromise</b> over historical Palestine, this study indicates a radicalization of Palestinian attitudes. Four survey studies, conducted in 1997, 2001, 2006 and 2009, reveal that Palestinian support for a two-state solution have decreased {{at the expense of}} an increased preference for an Islamic state in the whole of historical Palestine. Also, Palestinians do not believe that peace with Israel can be achieved in the near future, and are ready to continue their struggle against Israeli occupation in the West Bank. The study also reveals that Palestinians are becoming increasingly isolated and hence less exposed to alternative strategies in the conflict with Israel. These attitudinal changes follow the negative developments in the peace process and the violence that eruptedbetween Israelis and Palestinians in September 2000. Consequently, the lack of current public pressure on the Palestinian leadership to find a political compromise with Israel risks continued deadlock in the conflict. These changes also partly explain why Palestinians voted the Hamas movement into power in the January 2006 election...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to explore, {{in the context of the}} Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the {{influence}} of framing a decision task as inclusion or exclusion on Israeli-Jewish respondents' support for the concession of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. Respondents received a list of 40 Jewish settlements. Details such as the number of residents and geographical location were provided for each settlement. The respondents were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the inclusion condition 55 respondents were asked to mark the settlements for which they recommended that Israeli sovereignty be conceded. In the exclusion condition 53 respondents were asked to mark the settlements for which they recommended that Israeli sovereignty not be conceded. The findings confirm the predictions tested and indicate that: (1) Framing the task in terms of inclusion or exclusion affects respondents' support for <b>territorial</b> <b>compromise,</b> so that respondents in the exclusion condition support the concession of more settlements than respondents in the inclusion condition. (2) Framing the task in terms of inclusion or exclusion has a greater effect on support for conceding options (settlements) that are perceived as ambiguous (less consensual in the climate of opinion) in comparison to options (settlements) that are perceived as more clear-cut (more consensual). The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|From {{roughly the}} 1930 s into the 1970 s, labor-Zionist ideology, parties and {{institutions}} {{played a central}} role in the Zionist movement in Palestine, and then from 1948 in the State of Israel, manifesting one crucial way in which the Zionist project differed from other comparable settler colonial enterprises. Gershon Shafir's 1989 book 'Land, Labor and the Origins of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, 1882 - 1914 ' argued forcefully that it was labor Zionism's encounter with the land and labor markets in late-Ottoman Palestine, rather than abstract ideology, that led it to adopt a strategy based on the exclusion of indigenous Arab labor and economic separatism. This trajectory, he argued, also ultimately conduced to most Zionists' acceptance of <b>territorial</b> <b>compromise</b> in 1948.
