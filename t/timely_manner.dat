Moreover, we call invisible rapids those vertices whose temporal betweenness rank is considerably more significant than their static rank (i.e., the ones whose centrality was undetected by static betweenness), and invisible brooks the ones whose static betweenness is considerably higher than their temporal betweenness, meaning that these vertices can potentially be effective knowledge mobilizers, yet they are not acting as effectively as others due to slow or non-timely relations.|$|R

5|$|Prior to Debra's {{arrival in}} Texas, {{numerous}} hurricane warnings were issued {{and at least}} 8,600individuals evacuated. Torrential rains were produced in southeastern Texas, which led to widespread flooding on highways. Sea vessels took {{the brunt of the}} storm, with many having become stranded or damaged. Forms of transportation such as air, rail, and road were significantly interrupted or even shut down. High winds from the storm caused expansive damage to buildings, windows, signs, and roofs. The hurricane resulted in 11injuries but no deaths, and approximately 90cattle drowned. Damage in Texas' Brazoria, Galveston, and Harris counties surmounted $6.685million, and total damage from the storm reached $7million. In the aftermath, the Weather Bureau was criticized for the lack of warning; the bureau's chief, Stephen Lichtblau, maintained that it was fortunate that any warnings were issued, and those that were had been delivered in a <b>timely</b> <b>manner.</b>|$|E

In March 1948 they were evacuated to Kwajalein, and then settled onto another uninhabited island, Kili, in November. With only one third of a square mile, Kili has one sixth the land area of Bikini and, more important, has no lagoon and no protected harbor. Unable to practice their native culture of lagoon fishing, they became dependent on food shipments. Their four thousand descendants today are living on several islands and in foreign countries.|$|E

In contrast to the October 1990 and the 1991–1992 campaigns, the RPF advance in 1993 was met with only weak resistance from the FAR forces. The likely {{reason for this is}} a significant deterioration in morale and military experience in the government forces. The impact of the long running war on the economy, and a heavy devaluation of the Rwandan franc compared to the United States dollar, had left the government unable to pay its soldiers in a <b>timely</b> <b>manner.</b> The armed forces had also expanded rapidly, at one point growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one year.

5|$|A Folding@home {{participant}} installs {{a client}} program {{on their personal}} computer. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics. The computer clients run continuously in the background at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected. The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings. The client connects to a Folding@home server and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to uniprocessor and multi-core processor systems, and graphics processing units. The diversity and power of each hardware architecture provides Folding@home {{with the ability to}} efficiently complete many types of simulations in a <b>timely</b> <b>manner</b> (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value.

50|$|Daly and Wilson {{point out}} that {{infanticide}} is an extreme form of biasing parental investment that is widely practiced in the animal world. For example, when an immigrant male lion enters a pride, {{it is not uncommon}} for him to kill the cubs fathered by other males. Since the pride can only provide support for a limited number of cubs to survive to adulthood, the killing of the cubs in competition with the new male's potential offspring increases the chances of his progeny surviving to maturity. In addition, the act of infanticide speeds the return to sexual receptivity in the females, allowing for the male to father his own offspring in a <b>timelier</b> <b>manner.</b> These observations indicate that in the animal world, males employ certain measures in order to ensure that parental investment is geared specifically toward their own offspring.|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{predict that}} firms with {{stronger}} corporate governance will exhibit {{a higher degree}} of accounting conservatism. Governance level is assessed using a com-posite measure that incorporates several internal and external characteristics. Consistent with our prediction, strong governance firms show significantly higher levels of con-ditional accounting conservatism. Our tests take into account the endogenous nature of corporate governance, and the results are robust to the use of several measures of conservatism (market-based and nonmarket-based). Our evidence is consistent with the direction of causality flowing from governance to conservatism, and not vice versa, indicating that governance and conservatism are not substitutes. Finally, we study the impact of earnings discretion on the sensitivity of earnings to bad news across gover-nance structures. We find that, on average, strong-governance firms appear to use discretionary accruals to inform investors about bad news in a <b>timelier</b> <b>manner...</b>|$|R
5|$|As Felice {{neared the}} coast, gale {{warnings}} were hoisted from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Galveston, while a hurricane watch extended from Morgan City to Port O'Connor, Texas. Small craft advisories were also posted, cautioning light vessels {{to remain in}} port. All coastal advisories were discontinued by {{the early hours of}} September 16. Residents {{in the path of the}} storm generally evacuated in a <b>timely</b> <b>manner.</b> Over 3,000 fled the storm in Cameron Parish, Louisiana; around half of the residents in the low-lying southern part of the parish had already left before the mandatory evacuation was ordered. Farther west, one of two evacuation routes out of Sabine Pass, Texas had been rendered unusable a few days before the storm when a bridge was damaged in a maritime accident. As the remaining highway was considered susceptible to coastal flooding, officials quickly worked to evacuate 1,300 people in Sabine Pass before the storm's approach. The American Red Cross converted nine public schools into temporary storm shelters in and around Beaumont. Shelters were also set up in Houston and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, though they went mostly unused. The post offices in Sabine Pass, Gilchrist, and Port Bolivar transferred money orders, first-class parcels and postage stamps to the Beaumont office as a safety precaution.|$|E
5|$|The drop in air {{delivery}} to Korea caused Major General Earle E. Partridge, commanding the Far East Air Forces, to complain on August 10 that the Army was not fully using the airlift's 200 tonne daily capacity. That day, Eighth Army ordered curtailment of delivery by the Red Ball Express and {{increased use of}} the airlift to its maximum capacity. The reason given for this action was a sudden apprehension that the port of Pusan could not process the flow of water-borne supplies in a <b>timely</b> <b>manner.</b> The next day, upon Partridge's suggestion, two 2½-ton trucks were airlifted in a C-119 from Tachikawa Air Base in Japan to Taegu. The Air Force planned to airlift two trucks daily in this manner. As a result, on August 12, Eighth Army ordered the Red Ball Express be discontinued August 15 except on Tuesday and Friday of each week when it would carry cargo that was considered too difficult for the planes to handle. Under this arrangement airlift tonnage greatly increased. On August 16, transport planes carried 324tonnes of cargo and 595 passengers; on August 19, 160tonnes of cargo and 381 passengers; on 28 August, 398tonnes of cargo and 343 passengers; and, on August 29, 326tonnes of cargo and 347 passengers.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{commissioned}} on 22 November {{and became the}} flagship of Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall, commander of the naval defenses of Georgia. Under pressure from Mallory to engage the blockading ships, Tattnall attempted to engage them before any ironclads arrived on 5 January 1863, but army engineers could not clear the obstacles blocking the channel in a <b>timely</b> <b>manner,</b> despite early coordination being made by Tattnall to do so. It took another month to actually clear the obstacles and two monitors arrived {{before the end of}} January. Nonetheless Tattnall attempted to pass through the obstructions during high tide on 3 February, but high winds prevented the water from rising enough to allow the ship to do so. After Atlanta successfully passed through them on 19 March, Tattnall planned to attack the Union base at Port Royal, South Carolina while the monitors were attacking Charleston. Deserters revealed Tatnall's plan while he was waiting at the head of Wassaw Sound and he was forced to retreat when three monitors augmented the defenses at Port Royal. Dissatisfied with Tattnall's perceived lack of aggressiveness, Mallory replaced Tattnall as commander of the Savannah squadron later that month with Commander Richard L. Page. Page, in his turn was relieved in May by Commander William A. Webb; Atlanta remained the squadron flagship throughout this time.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to study the relationship between journals {{and the members of}} their editorial committees who publish articles in them.

40|$|Fault Tree Analysis is a {{traditional}} deductive safety analysis technique that is applied during the system design stage. However, traditional fault trees often suffer {{from a lack of}} formal semantics to check the correctness or consistency of the descriptions. This is especially a problem in safety-critical system analysis. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel formal fault tree construction method, which is different from traditional methods that focus on providing the formal semantics for the fault tree constructs after the informal fault tree has been built. In our method, the correctness of the fault tree is proved by the construction process itself, and the time relationships among different events are guaranteed by introducing temporal logic notations. Furthermore, by the stepwise deduction process, the hidden domain rules and inattentive design deficiencies can be discovered at an earlier stage, which helps the designers and domain experts effectively check and revise their system design in a <b>timelier</b> <b>manner...</b>|$|R
