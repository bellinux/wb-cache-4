5|$|Amazing {{began as}} a bedsheet format {{magazine}} and remained so until October 1933, when it switched to pulp size. With the April–May 1953 issue Amazing became a digest. Seven issues in the early 1980s, from November 1980 to November 1981, were a half-inch taller than the regular digest size, but thereafter the magazine reverted to the standard digest format. In May 1991 the magazine returned to a large format, but this lasted only until the Winter 1994 issue, and the next three issues were digest-sized again. When the magazine reappeared in 1998, it was in bedsheet format and remained <b>that</b> <b>size</b> until the very end. The last issue, March 2005, was distributed only as a PDF download, never as a physical magazine. The volume numbering contained some irregularities: the numbering given in the tables above {{appears to be in}} error for the period from 1979 to 1983, but in fact it is given correctly in the table. Note also that vol. 27 no. 8 was a single issue, not two, as it seems to be from the table; it was dated Dec 1953/Jan 1954.|$|E
5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, impounding it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, the water level rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} sandbar, or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself. Once the water level rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the incoming flow of the creek is nowhere near <b>that</b> <b>size.</b> Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking lot in the lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has never been able to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E
40|$|The {{genitalia}} of most male arthropods scale hypoallometrically {{with body}} <b>size,</b> <b>that</b> {{is they are}} {{more or less the same}} size across large and small individuals in a population. Such scaling is expected to arise when genital traits show less variation than somatic traits in response to factors <b>that</b> generate <b>size</b> variation among individuals in a population. Nevertheless, there have been few studies directly examining the relative sensitivity of genital and somatic traits to factors <b>that</b> affect their <b>size.</b> Such studies are key to understanding genital evolution and the evolution of morphological scaling relationships more generally. Previous studies indicate <b>that</b> the <b>size</b> of genital traits in male Drosophila melanogaster show a relatively low response to variation in environmental factors <b>that</b> affect trait <b>size.</b> Here we show <b>that</b> the <b>size</b> of genital traits in male fruit flies also exhibit a relatively low response to variation in genetic factors <b>that</b> affect trait <b>size.</b> Importantly, however, this low response is only to genetic factors that affect body and organ size systemically, not those <b>that</b> affect organ <b>size</b> autonomously. Further, we show that the genital traits do not show low levels of developmental instability, which is the response to stochastic developmental errors that also influence organ size autonomously.

5|$|British ornithologist David Lack {{considered}} that the Puerto Rican amazon had {{evolved from the}} Hispaniolan amazon (A. ventralis) found in Hispaniola, but it has since been argued that he omitted some elements in his analysis, including the similarities found between the black-billed amazon (A. agilis) of Jamaica and the Puerto Rican amazon. Subsequent studies showed <b>that</b> <b>size</b> and color patterns were not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships, and that patterns changed with relative ease even within {{members of the same}} species. The research concluded that the Puerto Rican amazon may share a common ancestor with the Jamaican A. agilis. Recent phylogenetic studies show that the Puerto Rican amazon is more closely related to the Hispaniolan amazon and the Cuban amazon than to the black-billed amazon.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{commercial}} {{contractors are}} currently {{licensed by the}} International Seabed Authority (an intergovernmental organization established to organize and control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area {{beyond the limits of}} national jurisdiction) to explore nodule resources and to test mining techniques in eight claim areas, each covering 150,000km². When mining ultimately begins, each mining operation is projected to directly disrupt 300–800km² of seafloor per year and disturb the benthic fauna over an area 5–10 times <b>that</b> <b>size</b> due to redeposition of suspended sediments. Thus, over the 15-year projected duration of a single mining operation, nodule mining might severely damage abyssal seafloor communities over areas of 20,000 to 45,000km² (a zone at least the size of Massachusetts).|$|E

The findings also indicate <b>that</b> tick <b>sizes</b> between Baht 0. 01 and Baht 1. 00 would, in general, enhance market liquidity by improving market depths and keeping trading costs low. It can be concluded that the SET could have implemented smaller ticks and fewer pricing grids.

5|$|Methods for {{measuring}} retreat include staking terminus location, global positioning mapping, aerial mapping and laser altimetry. The key symptom of disequilibrium is thinning {{along the entire}} length of the glacier. This indicates a diminishment of the accumulation zone. The result is marginal recession of the accumulation zone margin, not just of the terminus. In effect, the glacier no longer has a consistent accumulation zone and without an accumulation zone cannot survive. For example, Easton Glacier in Washington state, U.S. will likely shrink to half its size but at a slowing rate of reduction and stabilize at <b>that</b> <b>size</b> despite the warmer temperature over a few decades. However, the Grinnell Glacier in Montana, U.S. will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. The difference is that the upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, is melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with minimal altitude range are most likely to fall into disequilibrium with the climate.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people in}} the stadium were unaware that the (first) Ibrox {{disaster}} had happened. People even re-occupied the damaged area, despite the danger of further collapse. A definite reason for the disaster was not agreed upon, partly {{because there was no}} public inquiry held. Some experts blamed the quality of wood and the supplier was tried for culpable homicide, but was acquitted. The design was also cited as a possible cause. Generally, wooden structures of <b>that</b> <b>size</b> were not trusted. Rangers removed the wooden terraces, reducing capacity to 25,000. The criticism of the design did not deter Rangers from hiring Leitch in the future. He designed an expansion of Ibrox to a 63,000 capacity by 1910, using slopes made of earth. By this point, the city of Glasgow had the three largest purpose-built football grounds in the world.|$|E

Myers pointed out that Germany, France, England, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Russia, Italy and China all had aeronautical apparatus, schools of practice, and secret experimental construction plants making state-of-the-art propeller power driven airships for war. He pointed out as early as October 1890 Commandant Charles Renard was in possession of a motor that could drive La France dirigible airship twenty-eight miles an hour and such an airship or a war airship twice <b>that</b> <b>size</b> traveling at forty-five miles an hour could totally destroy any major city in America without difficulty because of its speed.
