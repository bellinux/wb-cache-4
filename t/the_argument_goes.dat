5|$|For many scholars, {{the scene}} at 6.34 seems to {{anticipate}} and parallel the confrontation between Theodosius and Ambrose in 390; Erasmus used the two situations as parallel exempla in a letter written to Francis I in 1523. That later event has been taken as evidence against Philip's Christianity. Even in the later 4th century, {{in a society that}} had already been significantly Christianized, <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>goes,</b> Theodosius' humiliation had shocked the sensibilities of the aristocratic elite. It is therefore inconceivable that 3rd century aristocrats, members of a society that had experienced only partial Christianization, would accept such self-abasement from their emperors. Shahîd contests this parallel, and argues that Philip's scene was far less humiliating than Theodosius': it did not take place against the same background (Theodosius had massacred seven thousand Thessalonicans some months before), no one was excommunicated (Theodosius was excommunicated for eight months), and it did not involve the same dramatic and humiliating dialogue between emperor and bishop. Philip made a quick repentance at a small church {{on his way back to}} Rome from the Persian front, a stark contrast to the grandeur of Theodosius' confrontation with Ambrose.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the componential model, {{construction}} grammar {{denies any}} strict {{distinction between the}} two and proposes a syntax-lexicon continuum. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>goes</b> that words and complex constructions are both pairs of form and meaning and differ only in internal symbolic complexity. Instead of being discrete modules and thus subject to very different processes they form the extremes of a continuum (from regular to idiosyncratic): syntax>subcategorization frame>idiom>morphology>syntactic category>word/lexicon (these are the traditional terms; construction grammars use a different terminology).|$|E
500|$|A popular [...] "proof {{is in the}} pudding" [...] {{argument}} is often made, especially by consultants themselves; <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>goes</b> that since attorneys and clients pay such high fees (sometimes as much as $500,000) for consultants, their services must be effective. Others argue that most attorneys are unaware of the social science research on the topic.|$|E

2500|$|Good's {{argument}} involves {{calculating the}} weight of evidence provided by the observation of a black raven or a white shoe {{in favor of the}} hypothesis that all the ravens in a collection of objects are black.

2500|$|Some tax protesters argue that, in {{connection}} with the phrase [...] "to include the District of Columbia," [...] the term [...] "include" [...] generally should have the meaning of exclusivity of whatever is being listed if the list is made in a certain way. In such situations, of which the definition of [...] "State" [...] is an example, <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>goes</b> that no things not in the list are included with what is included.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional historiography in Iran {{has claimed}} that Ferdowsi was grieved {{by the fall}} of the Sassanid Empire and its {{subsequent}} rule by [...] "Arabs" [...] and [...] "Turks". The Shahnameh, <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>goes,</b> is largely his effort to preserve the memory of Persia's golden days and transmit it to a new generation so that they could learn and try to build a better world. Although most scholars have contended that Ferdowsi's main concern was the preservation of the pre-Islamic legacy of myth and history, a number of authors have formally challenged this view.|$|E
50|$|Negative {{theology}} also {{figures in}} the Buddhist and Hindu polemics. <b>The</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>go</b> something like this - Is Brahman an object of experience?

50|$|Another {{failed attempt}} to {{increase}} safety in Salem was undertaken by Charles J. Collins. He had visited Philadelphia where high-pressure wagons pumped water through 3.25 in pipes {{for a range of}} 360 ft. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>went</b> that high-pressure pumps would pay for themselves with the reduction of insurance fees.

2500|$|Japanese, Italian and Nazi {{aggression}} that precipitated World War II {{often is}} cited as an argument against pacifism.

Adolf Hitler told the British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in 1937 that the British should [...] "shoot Gandhi, and if this doesn't suffice to reduce them to submission, shoot a dozen leading members of the Congress, and if that doesn't suffice shoot 200, and so on, as you {{make it clear that}} you mean business." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{observed}} above, the (precise) [...] "philosophical {{parameters of}} modern Orthodoxy" [...] are not readily defined. It is posited then that [...] "modern orthodoxy", as such, may be disappearing, [...] "being sucked into pluralistic Judaism {{on the left}} and yeshivish on the right". [...] "Modern orthodoxy", then, as opposed to constituting an ideological spectrum centred on a common core of values, is, in fact, (tending towards) several entirely separate movements. In fact, [...] "any are making the argument {{that the time has come}} to state the inevitable or to admit that which already has occurred: There is no longer a cohesive, singular Modern Orthodoxy.

2500|$|The Russian {{government}} and officials continue {{to maintain that}} the Soviet annexation of the Baltic states was legitimate and that the Soviet Union liberated the countries from the Nazis. They state that the Soviet troops had entered the Baltic countries in 1940 following the agreements and {{with the consent of}} the governments of the Baltic republics. They maintain that the USSR was not in a state of war and was not waging any combat activities on the territory of the three Baltic states, therefore, <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>goes,</b> the word 'occupation' can not be used.

25|$|The {{feeling of}} {{cultural}} outrage {{was much more}} important than anti-Semitism as such; or rather, it turned into anti-Semites, at any rate for the moment, people who normally never expressed such feelings. It was he Jew-as-Iconoclast which aroused the really deep rage... Mahler had begun it; Schönberg carried it on; both were Jews, and they corrupted young Aryan composers like Berg - so <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>went.</b>|$|R
60|$|Paul {{struck a}} match, {{looked at his}} watch, and remarked that it was nearly one o'clock--a way he had when <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>went</b> against him.

2500|$|David Aers, in particular, has {{challenged}} {{the idea that}} women were [...] "empowered" [...] by imitation of Christ through self-inflicted suffering or by a [...] "natural" [...] association of women's bodies with food (due to lactation) or with a feminized Christ, whose body nurtured, even nursed, the hungry of spirit and who was imagined as birthing salvation on the cross. [...] He characterizes the [...] "empowerment thesis" [...] as follows: [...] "as <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>goes,</b> as Christ's suffering humanity saved the world so suffering women, subjected by their culture in numerous ways, become the most powerful representatives of the powerless, bleeding, suffering, but salvific Christ" [...] (30). Aers questions whether women's ascetic imitation of the [...] "dominant figuration of Christ's humanity" [...] really [...] "empowered the subordinate" [...] or [...] "subverted the logic and religion of a patriarchal and profoundly mysoginistic [...] culture" [...] (34).|$|E
2500|$|As Andrew Ilachinski {{points out}} in his Cellular Automata, many {{scholars}} have {{raised the question of}} whether the universe is a cellular automaton. Ilachinski argues that the importance of this question may be better appreciated with a simple observation, which can be stated as follows. Consider the evolution of rule 110: if it were some kind of [...] "alien physics", what would be a reasonable description of the observed patterns? If an observer did not know how the images were generated, that observer might end up conjecturing about the movement of some particle-like objects. Indeed, physicist James Crutchfield has constructed a rigorous mathematical theory out of this idea, proving the statistical emergence of [...] "particles" [...] from cellular automata.], [...] 75, 11–54, 1994. Then, as <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>goes,</b> one might wonder if our world, which is currently well described, at our current level of understanding, by physics with particle-like objects, could be a CA at its most fundamental level with the gaps in information or incomplete understanding of fundamental data appearing as an arbitrary random order that would seem contrary to CA.|$|E
2500|$|How {{exactly the}} average {{industrial}} rate of profit will evolve, is either uncertain and unpredictable, {{or it is}} historically contingent; {{it all depends on}} the specific configuration of costs, sales and profit margins obtainable in fluctuating markets with given technologies. This [...] "indeterminacy" [...] criticism revolves around the idea that technological change could have many different and contradictory effects. It could reduce costs, or it could increase unemployment; it could be labor saving, or it could be capital saving. Therefore, so <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>goes,</b> it is impossible to infer definitely a theoretical principle that a falling rate of profit must always and inevitably result from an increase in productivity. Perhaps the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall might be true in an abstract model, based on certain assumptions, but in reality no substantive empirical predictions can be made. In addition, profitability itself can be influenced by an enormous array of different factors, going far beyond those which Marx specified. So there are tendencies and counter-tendencies operating simultaneously, and no particular empirical result necessarily follows from them.|$|E

40|$|The peasants in {{the third}} world was for a long time assumed to be the {{opposite}} to the "economic man". The peasants, so <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>went,</b> were irrational and their behaviour was determined by traditions, not by economic incentives. Some important contributions to economic theory have questioned this assumption. Now the issue is not whether peasants respond to economic incentives, but how. This study is a survey of the theoretical and empirical examination of peasants response to price incentives in Tanzania...|$|R
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the second person}} accepts the {{hypothesis}} that [...] "All non-black objects are non-ravens", then the approximately 50 non-black objects about which it was uncertain whether each was a raven, will be thought to be non-ravens. At the same time, nothing different will be thought about the approximately 50 remaining objects (the black objects). Consequently, he should estimate {{the number of black}} ravens at 25, the number of black non-ravens at 25 and the number of non-black non-ravens at 50. According to this argument, since the two people disagree about their estimates after they have accepted the different hypotheses, accepting [...] "All ravens are black" [...] is not equivalent to accepting [...] "All non-black things are non-ravens"; accepting the former means estimating more things to be black, while accepting the latter involves estimating more things to be non-ravens. Correspondingly, <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>goes,</b> the former requires as evidence ravens that turn out to be black and the latter requires non-black things that turn out to be non-ravens.|$|E
6000|$|His {{letter to}} Elizabeth, written some few months later, {{was a mere}} {{amplification}} of the sentences quoted above.

[...] <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>goes</b> thus: The regiment of women is, as before noted in our work, repugnant to nature, contumely to God, and a subversion of good order. It has nevertheless pleased God to raise up, as exceptions to this law, first Deborah, and afterward Elizabeth Tudor--whose regiment we shall proceed to celebrate.|$|E
