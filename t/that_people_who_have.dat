5|$|In {{the third}} book, Saving Shiloh, Marty's parents persuade Marty <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> wronged {{are worthy of}} forgiveness. In the midst of several robberies and a murder, the {{community}} hastily faults Judd. Willing to grant Judd a second chance, Marty attempts to help him. Meanwhile, Marty and his family must face the intricacies of life such as death, hostility, and sibling rivalry.|$|E

25|$|Studies show <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a vitrectomy {{soon after}} a large {{hemorrhage}} {{are more likely}} to protect their vision than someone who waits to have the operation. Early vitrectomy is especially effective in people with insulin-dependent diabetes, who may be at greater risk of blindness from a hemorrhage into the eye.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Court of Israel {{ruled in}} 1989 that Messianic Judaism {{constituted}} another religion, and <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> become Messianic Jews were not therefore eligible for Aliyah under the law.|$|R
25|$|Responses to {{this are}} partly {{dependent}} {{on whether the}} reader has already encountered the standard trolley problem (since there is a desire to keep one's responses consistent), but Unger notes <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not encountered such problems before are quite likely to say that, in this case, the proposed action would be wrong.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reported}} common sensation {{related to}} OBE was temporary or projective catalepsy, a more common feature of sleep paralysis. The sleep paralysis and OBE correlation was later corroborated by the Out-of-Body Experience and Arousal {{study published in}} Neurology by Kevin Nelson and his colleagues from the University of Kentucky in 2007. The study discovered <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> out-of-body experiences {{are more likely to}} suffer from sleep paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theory is}} <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{recovered}} from polio lose remaining healthy neurons {{at a faster}} rate than normal. However, little evidence exists to support this idea. Finally, it has been proposed that the initial polio infection causes an autoimmune reaction, in which the body's immune system attacks normal cells as if they were foreign substances. Again, compared to neural fatigue, the evidence supporting this theory is quite limited.|$|E
50|$|Jastrow found <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{lost their}} {{eyesight}} after age six still {{were able to}} see in their dreams, and <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> lost their eyesight before the age of five could not. This same difference in perception and age was true for people with partial vision loss. Jastrow concluded that sight was not innate, and that significant mental development occurred between ages five and seven. He noted that hearing, not sensation, was the primary sense of the blind, in both waking and dream. He collected first-hand accounts of dreams from visually impaired individuals, including Helen Keller.|$|R
50|$|In September 2002, HNR {{scientists}} {{proved a}} link between diabetes and being overweight. They found <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> lost 9 lb in weight had reduced the chances of having diabetes by 58%.|$|R

25|$|The {{patient may}} want to {{consider}} some basic preparation before the surgery. The most basic preparation is <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> body hair on the chest {{may want to}} remove the hair by clipping just prior to surgery or using a depilatory agent (preoperative shaving has been on the decline as it can cause skin breakage and increase infection risk of any surgical procedure) as the surgery will involve bandages and monitoring equipment to be affixed to the body.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{studies using}} polysomnography have {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sleep disruption have elevated nighttime levels of circulating cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone. They {{also have an}} elevated metabolic rate, which does not occur in {{people who do not}} have insomnia but whose sleep is intentionally disrupted during a sleep study. Studies of brain metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) scans indicate that people with insomnia have higher metabolic rates by night and by day. The question remains whether these changes are the causes or consequences of long-term insomnia.|$|E
25|$|In {{line with}} the {{salience}} hypothesis, there is considerable evidence <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> more vivid, intense or unusual dreams show better recall. There is evidence that continuity of consciousness is related to recall. Specifically, people who have vivid and unusual experiences during the day {{tend to have more}} memorable dream content and hence better dream recall. People who score high on measures of personality traits associated with creativity, imagination, and fantasy, such as openness to experience, daydreaming, fantasy proneness, absorption, and hypnotic susceptibility, tend to show more frequent dream recall. There is also evidence for continuity between the bizarre aspects of dreaming and waking experience. That is, people who report more bizarre experiences during the day, such as people high in schizotypy (psychosis proneness) have more frequent dream recall and also report more frequent nightmares.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study done}} {{investigating}} {{whether or not}} the viewing of natural scenery may influence the recoveries of people from undergoing surgeries, found <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> a window with a scenic view had shorter postoperative hospital stays and fewer negative comments from nurses.|$|R

500|$|The defence {{also argued}} <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> carried out {{so-called}} [...] "altruistic" [...] killings {{have been known}} to engage in ritualistic behaviour before killing themselves, and that Sheila might have placed the silencer in the cupboard, changed her clothes and washed herself, which would explain why there was little lead on her hands, or sugar from the floor on her feet. There was also a possibility that the blood in the silencer was not hers, but was a mixture of Nevill's and June's.|$|E
500|$|Moran said he {{supported}} the redistribution of wealth, saying in November 2008 that [...] "We have been guided by a Republican administration who believes in this simplistic notion <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> wealth are entitled to keep it and they have an antipathy towards the means of redistributing wealth." [...] He also said on his website that the recession was largely [...] "a result of the imbalance {{in the distribution of}} wealth {{over the last eight years}} and an absence of oversight and accountability." ...|$|E
500|$|Since the 19th century, many apocalyptic millennial Christian eschatologists, {{starting}} with John Nelson Darby, have predicted a globalist conspiracy {{to impose a}} tyrannical New World Order governing structure as the fulfillment of prophecies about the [...] "end time" [...] in the Bible, specifically in the Book of Ezekiel, the Book of Daniel, the Olivet discourse found in the Synoptic Gospels and the Book of Revelation. They claim <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{made a deal with}} the Devil to gain wealth and power have become pawns in a supernatural chess game to move humanity into accepting a utopian world government that rests on the spiritual foundations of a syncretic-messianic world religion, which will later reveal itself to be a dystopian world empire that imposes the imperial cult of an “Unholy Trinity” of Satan, the Antichrist and the False Prophet. In many contemporary Christian conspiracy theories, the False Prophet will be either the last pope of the Catholic Church (groomed and installed by an Alta Vendita or Jesuit conspiracy), a guru from the New Age movement, or even the leader of an elite fundamentalist Christian organization like the Fellowship, while the Antichrist will be either the President of the European Union, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, or even the Caliph of a pan-Islamic state.|$|E

500|$|U2 Live at Red Rocks {{is often}} cited as a {{watershed}} moment in U2's history which established their reputation as an exceptional live act. In the liner notes of the remastered version of the film, music journalist Anthony DeCurtis wrote, [...] "this concert set goals for U2 that might have daunted any other young band. But {{in the shadow of}} their wild ambitions at Red Rocks, these four boys met, once again, the men of their future, and became who they would become." [...] Rolling Stone called the band's performance of [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] from the film one of the [...] "50 Moments that Changed the History of Rock and Roll". The magazine said, [...] "he sight of Bono singing the anti-violence anthem 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' while waving a white flag through crimson mist (created by a combination of wet weather, hot lights and the illumination of those crags) became the defining image of U2's warrior-rock spirit and—shown in heavy rotation on MTV—broke the band nationwide." [...] Director Gavin Taylor said that the video [...] "kick-started their career" [...] and [...] "fired them like a rocket into the sky". In 2009, Relix named U2's performance at Red Rocks the 24th-best concert of all time. The Denver Post said the concert affirmed Red Rocks Amphitheatre's status as a premier outdoor venue. Rocky Mountain News said that the concert was [...] "asily one of the most famous, acclaimed concerts of the 1980s (if not all time)", and <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> visited the Amphitheatre ever since have been disappointed to learn that the pyres {{are not part of the}} venue and were only used for the U2 concert. Music biographer Dave Thompson said the concert [...] "transformed U2...into a very successful rock band", and that without U2, [...] "Red Rocks would be just another smartly lit amphitheater".|$|E

2500|$|Thankfully, MDR-TB strains {{appear to}} be less fit and less transmissible. It has been known of many years that INH-resistant TB is less virulent in guinea pigs, and the {{epidemiological}} evidence is that MDR strains of TB do not dominate naturally. [...] A study in Los Angeles found that only 6% of cases of MDR-TB were clustered. [...] This {{should not be a}} cause for complacency: it must be remembered that MDR-TB has a mortality rate comparable to lung cancer. [...] It must also be remembered <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> weakened immune systems (because of diseases such as HIV or because of drugs) are more susceptible to catching TB.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} examples of computer-assisted reporting was in 1967, after riots in Detroit, when Meyer, on temporary assignment with the Detroit Free Press, used survey research, analyzed on a mainframe computer, to show <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> attended college were equally likely to have rioted as were high school dropouts.|$|R
2500|$|One of the film's themes is, {{according}} to Lynch, [...] "finding love in Hell". He has stated [...] "For me, it's just {{a compilation of}} ideas that come along. The darker ones and the lighter ones, the humorous ones, all working together. You {{try to be as}} true as you can to those ideas and try to get them on film." [...] Some critics have postulated that, similar to Lynch's previous Blue Velvet, the sudden idealistic ending of perfect happiness is ironic, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> the potential for violence struggle to find true happiness. Lynch himself, however, refers to the ending of Wild at Heart as being a [...] "happy" [...] one, having consciously made the decision to change the original darker ending from the novel.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{theme of}} the poem {{is the idea that}} was novel in the times of early nationalisms based on {{centralized}} nation-statesthat the lack of political sovereignty does not preclude the existence of a nation. As Adam Mickiewicz explained in 1842 to students of Slavic Literature in Paris, the song [...] "The famous song of the Polish legions begins with lines that express the new history: Poland has not perished yet as long as we live. These words mean <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> in them what constitutes the essence of a nation can prolong the existence of their country regardless of its political circumstances and may even strive to make it real again..." [...] The song also includes a call to arms and expresses the hope that, under General Dąbrowski's command, the legionaries would rejoin their nation and retrieve [...] "what the alien force has seized" [...] through armed struggle.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2008, the Lower Manhattan Security Initiative in a {{partnership}} between the New York City Police Department and Microsoft began the Domain Awareness System to monitor New York City. The program allowed the department to track surveillance targets and gain detailed information about them.
