To Americans, it can sometimes represent elitism and power politics, {{and its role}} {{has been a source}} of controversy throughout the nation's history, particularly beginning around the Gilded Age period in the late 19th century. Wall Street became the symbol of a country and economic system <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>Americans</b> see as having developed through trade, capitalism, and innovation.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the physics}} and {{metallurgy}} of boilers were poorly understood, steamboats were prone to boiler explosions that killed {{hundreds of people}} between the 1810s and 1840s. In 1838, legislation was enacted that mandated boiler inspections by federal agents under the threat of revocation of the operator's navigation licenses and lowered the threshold for liability in suits arising from such accidents. While Americans long resisted any government's power to regulate private property, these new rules demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>Americans</b> believed that property rights did not override civil rights and set the precedent for future federal safety regulations.|$|E

An exhibition game between two of the leagues was played on August 20, 2011, with the Goodman League defeating the Drew League, 135–134.

500|$|John Sherman was a {{longtime}} senator from Ohio who also served {{the state in}} the House of Representatives in the late 1850s and early 1860s. As a senator, Sherman led the planning of the national banking system. He also oversaw the national policy for the post-Civil War banking system, and helped restore the nation's finances after the Panic of 1873. Under President Hayes, Sherman served as the Secretary of the Treasury, advocating for the gold standard and building up the country's gold reserves. Sherman's colleagues did not have much confidence in their presidential bid. Sherman was known as the [...] "Ohio Icicle" [...] for his uncharismatic personality, which made him unappealing to voters. His colleagues commented that in public, Sherman [...] "was not eloquent, though a graceful speaker, confining himself almost entirely to statements of fact." [...] In private, he was [...] "reserved, self-contained," [...] a personality <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>Americans</b> were not comfortable with. As President, Sherman intended to continue his support for the gold standard. Prior {{to the start of the}} convention, papers had predicted Sherman to receive 110 votes in the balloting. Sherman felt that he still had a chance at the nomination once the Grant vote broke apart after five or six ballots.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{broadcast}} in the United States on NBC on Monday, September 21, 1998, in the 9:3010 p.m. (PST) timeslot.

With a Nielsen rating of 8.6, equivalent to approximately 8.4 million viewing households, it was the fifteenth-highest-rated show on NBC the week it aired. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Joyce Millman of Salon Entertainment said the episode has [...] "glimmers of class" [...] and the jokes are [...] "relatively sophisticated". John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that Burrows's direction was [...] "sharp as usual" [...] and the writing was [...] "above average". Brian Lambert of the St. Paul Pioneer Press said the pilot was [...] "nicely staged by veteran director Jimmy Burrows, and coming from a couple producers, Max Mutchnick and David Cohan, who assisted Boston Common and Dream On, the show – {{which is to say}} the pilot episode (everything could go to hell next week) – has the best verbal interplay of any of the season's new sitcoms." [...] William Horn from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) thought the episode was a [...] "wonderful" [...] representation of a gay man's life [...] "regardless of whether he's in a relationship in that very moment. I think it's important that American audiences realize that lesbians and gay men are not simply all about sexual situations." [...] Ellen Gray of the Chicago Tribune was also positive about the show: [...] "For those who believe that Hollywood's engaging in a conspiracy to 'normalize' a sexual orientation <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>Americans</b> still find abhorrent, Will & Grace will look like a candy-coated poison pill. To those who think that Hollywood isn't moving fast enough in offering sexual parity for gays, it may just look like poison.
