6000|$|... "Well, O'Connor, I am {{very glad}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> staff. You see, {{it makes a}} lot of difference, when there are only two of us, that we should like each other. I own I have not done {{anything}} as yet to get any credit, for at Vimiera it was just stand up and beat them back, and I had not a single message to carry, and, of course, at Rolica our brigade was not in it; but I hope I shall get a turn some day. Then it was your father who was badly wounded?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon {{this long}} letter. You may {{call me a}} crank or any hard [...] name you please, but I am anxious <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right side [...] in this {{struggle}}, for it is a struggle to the death. The [...] tragedy of their certain extinction overwhelms me at times. I [...] found a little scrap of canvas with a sketch of Peta on it--may [...] I keep it? My sister is quite well and deep in 'the work.' She [...] often speaks of you and we are both hoping to see you next [...] year." ...|$|E

5000|$|Neil Genzlinger's {{review in}} The New York Times was more tepid, {{claiming}} that [...] "parts of it work, {{but the overall}} package is never really suspenseful enough <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> edge or overtly funny {{enough to be a}} lark." ...|$|R

6000|$|He leaned forward, laying {{his hand}} on Newman's arm {{compressing}} his lips and shaking his head. [...] "The fact is my dear fellow, you see, that you ought never to have gone into it. It was not your doing, I know--it was all my wife. If {{you want to come}} down on her, I'll stand off; I give you leave to hit her as hard as you like. You know she has never had a word of reproach from me in her life, and I think she is in need of something of the kind. Why didn't you listen to ME? You know I didn't believe in the thing. I thought it at the best an amiable delusion. I don't profess to be a Don Juan or a gay Lothario,--that class of man, you know; but I do pretend to know something about the harder sex. I have never disliked a woman in my life that she has not turned out badly. I was not at all deceived in Lizzie, for instance; I always had my doubts about her. Whatever you may think of my present situation, I must at least admit that I got into it with my eyes open. Now suppose you had got into something like this box with Madame de Cintre. You may depend upon it she would have turned out a stiff one. And upon my word I don't see where you could have found your comfort. Not from the marquis, my dear Newman; he wasn't a man you could go and talk things over with in a sociable, common-sense way. Did he ever seem to want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> premises--did he ever try to see you alone? Did he ever ask you to come and smoke a cigar with him of an evening, or step in, when you had been calling on the ladies, and take something? I don't think you would have got much encouragement out of HIM. And as for the old lady, she struck one as an uncommonly strong dose. They have a great expression here, you know; they call it 'sympathetic.' Everything is sympathetic--or ought to be. Now Madame de Bellegarde is about as sympathetic as that mustard-pot. They're a d--d cold-blooded lot, any way; I felt it awfully at that ball of theirs. I felt as if I were walking {{up and down in the}} Armory, in the Tower of London! My dear boy, don't think me a vulgar brute for hinting at it, but you may depend upon it, all they wanted was your money. I know something about that; I can tell when people want one's money! Why they stopped wanting yours I don't know; I suppose because they could get some one else's without working so hard for it. It isn't worth finding out. It may be that it was not Madame de Cintre that backed out first, very likely the old woman put her up to it. I suspect she and her mother are really as thick as thieves, eh? You are well out of it, my boy; make up your mind to that. If I express myself strongly it is all because I love you so much; and from that point of view I may say I should as soon have thought of making up to that piece of pale high-mightiness as I should have thought of making up to the Obelisk in the Place des la Concorde." ...|$|E
5000|$|BFI Screenonline {{referred}} to the film as [...] "Ralph Thomas's tepid student drama"; but Sky Movies concluded the film [...] "still manages to generate moments of high excitement - none more so than a climatic climb up the sheer side of a crumbling steeple - a few minutes that are guaranteed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of your chair." ...|$|E
