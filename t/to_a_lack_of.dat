30|$|Our data is correlational, so {{we cannot}} {{determine}} the extent <b>to</b> which <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> science identity motivates dropping out of STEM {{and the extent to}} which those who drop out then feel <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> identity. However, among the leavers, women were more likely <b>to</b> report <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> science identity than men, and students of color were more likely <b>to</b> report <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> science identity than white students. No white male (major or leaver) reported <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> science identity; all reports describing <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> science identity were from students in marginalized groups. This relationship indicates that science identity is strongly connected to both race and gender and, given that students of color and women leave STEM at higher rates, it is likely that science identity plays a role in persistence.|$|R

Eventually, some effort was done to complete both the Santa Margherita and Cottonera Lines in the early 18th century, although some of the planned ravelins, cavaliers, ditch and other fortifications were never constructed. Fort San Salvatore was built on one of the Cottonera Lines bastions in 1724.|$|E
