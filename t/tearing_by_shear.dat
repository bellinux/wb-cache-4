At first, the relationship between contour line of vertical blade and the direction of shear force and chip flow are studied, and the influence on the quality of <b>shearing</b> caused <b>by</b> the size of blanking clearance is analyzed. Then a new blade contour line that made most of the iron chippings is located outside of the tube and reasonable blanking clearance is obtained. Further, based on the <b>tearing</b> caused <b>by</b> single-blade <b>shear</b> on the top of steel tube, the shape and angle of the vertical blade are studied, and the structure of the vertical blade nose is optimized, which improves the shearing quality of the blade. Finally, the numerical simulation of the process of shearing is done to verify the feasibility of the designed structure by the finite element software DEFORM...|$|R
40|$|AbstractApplying {{compression}} and shear combined loading to pure iron, pure titanium {{and stainless steel}} powders with different hardness, the densification effect <b>by</b> <b>shear</b> loading was compared. For all powder the large density improvement <b>by</b> <b>shear</b> loading was seen. The density increment <b>by</b> <b>shear</b> loading greatly depended on the density namely residual cavities before shear loading. Then the density increment <b>by</b> <b>shear</b> loading was large for high hardness powder on 700 MPa. However, on 300 MPa the density increment for stainless powder was smaller than for titanium powder although the density before shear loading was lowest. This was because the plastic deformation of high hardness powder was not easily promoted even <b>by</b> <b>shear</b> loading in low compression pressure. The densification effect <b>by</b> {{compression and}} <b>shear</b> combined loading depends on the density before giving shear loading and the ease of powder plastic deformation...|$|R
