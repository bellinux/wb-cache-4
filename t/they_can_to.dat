5|$|The party {{sets out}} for Paranor. But along the way, Shea falls over a {{waterfall}} and becomes {{separated from the}} group. Allanon spurs the group to continue to Paranor. Once there, the party gets into a battle with minions of the Warlock Lord and find that the Sword of Shannara has already been removed. The party then learns of the Warlock Lord's invasion of the Southland, and decide to split up to do what <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> stop it.|$|E
5|$|Roswell {{also did}} theater. In 1986 she {{appeared}} in improvisatory shows directed by Paul Sills at Lamb's Theatre, in which the actors were given characters and situations by the audience members. In 1988 she {{had a role in}} Julia Sweeney's play Mea's Big Apology at Groundling Theatre in Los Angeles. She played Eunice, a cynical woman who works at a malpractice insurance company and is a colleague to the main character. The company people do everything <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> dismiss her because {{they do not want to}} pay her retirement benefits, which are about to take effect. Roswell reprised this role in a 1992 revival of the play, also at Groundling Theatre.|$|E

People with spastic quadriplegia are {{the least}} {{likely to be able to}} walk, or if <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> <b>to</b> want to walk, because their muscles are too tight and it is too much effort to do so. Some children with quadriplegia also have hemiparetic tremors, an uncontrollable shaking that affects the limbs on one side of the body and impairs normal movement.|$|E
50|$|The {{second stage}} is where players attempt to hit their ball within a target circle from 4 {{different}} locations. Hitting within the target results in 2 points and holing the shot results in 10 points. If <b>they</b> miss, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> choose <b>to</b> take a mulligan {{and hit the}} shot again {{at the cost of}} 1 point, or <b>they</b> <b>can</b> choose <b>to</b> stop. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> have up <b>to</b> two mulligans.|$|R
50|$|Often players want to {{gain the}} lead early and play their most {{uncertain}} cards first. If they win tricks, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> try <b>to</b> throw away some other strong cards. If the uncertain cards lose, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> try <b>to</b> pick up tricks with stronger cards.|$|R

They also announced that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> return <b>to</b> being bears only if <b>they</b> <b>can</b> announce {{until the end of}} 2017 a solo live concert at Nippon Budokan.|$|R
25|$|January – Seventy Tad Callister {{stated in}} a speech at BYU-I reprinted in the Ensign that the church's views on {{same-sex}} sexual behavior is eternal doctrine and not a temporary policy. He additionally alluded to homosexual feelings as a weakness or imperfection for which those with those tendencies must do all <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> use the refining power of the atonement to convert into a strength through the atonement.|$|E

All of the members {{are anxious to}} be active and want to arouse Interest among all {{of the women in the}} city irrespective of nationality.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fifth}} book, Dumbledore is demoted from Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, voted {{out of the}} Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards, and is almost {{stripped}} of his Order of Merlin First Class due to his speeches regarding the return of Voldemort, although it is reported that he is unconcerned {{as long as he}} is not taken off the Chocolate Frog cards. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Magic does everything <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> discredit him and Harry – mainly through the Daily Prophet. At the beginning of the book, Dumbledore enrages Fudge when he stops by at Harry's hearing with a witness (Arabella Figg) to ensure that he is not expelled. While Harry feels better when Dumbledore assists him, he becomes annoyed {{to the point of being}} angry that the headmaster refuses to speak to or even look at him.|$|E

25|$|The trio then confronts Paradox, who {{reveals that}} {{he comes from}} a future beyond Yusei's in which the world lies in ruins, and claims {{that the only way to}} fix it is to {{eliminate}} Duel Monsters from history. However, the three heroes protest that by doing so all the future events and people will be erased as well, and challenge him to a duel. By combining the powers of their key monsters, Yugi, Jaden and Yusei defeat Paradox, who disappears. After the duel, Yusei, Jaden and Yugi say that they will do what <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> make sure the future is not like Paradox's, and say goodbye and the latter two return to their respective time periods. New Domino City returns to normal, and Yusei finally can let go of the past and focus on the future.|$|E
25|$|Several months {{pass with}} Carlisle {{monitoring}} Renesmee's rapid growth. On an outing in the woods, a bitter Irina sees Renesmee {{from a distance}} and believes her to be an immortal child. Immortal children were vampires who were changed in childhood, and {{because they could not}} be trained nor restrained, they destroyed entire villages. They were eventually executed, as were the parents who created them, and the creation of such children outlawed. Irina goes to the Volturi to report what she has seen. Alice sees the Volturi and Irina coming to kill the Cullens, and instructs the others to gather as many witnesses as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> testify that Renesmee is not an immortal. The Cullens begin to summon witnesses, such as the Denali family. One of the Denali, Eleazar, later discovers that Bella has a special ability: a powerful mental shield which had protected her from Edward's mind reading even when she was human, and which she can now extend to protect others from attacks.|$|E
25|$|The Roman general Messala and {{his troops}} {{have come to}} track down the British king Arvire and bring him captive to the Emperor Claudius in Rome. Princes Irvin and Vellinus enter and tell the Romans their search is in vain: in his hiding place on Mona, Arvire can never be caught. Messala replies that Arvire might be taken by cunning and asks the princes to help him: their mother, Queen Élfrida, has already become an ally of Rome. Vellinus agrees to betray Arvire, {{although}} Irvin is outraged at his brother's behaviour. The brothers leave as the Druids arrive to perform their sacred ritual. Modred, the Chief Druid, says they must do all <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> protect Arvire from the Romans. Arvire enters, accompanied by his daughter Évélina. Arvire is in despair: after his defeat in battle, the Romans captured his wife. Some of the Druids bring in Irvin and Vellinus, whom they have found lurking nearby. Vellinus says they have come with news from their mother, the Queen of Lenox, who now wants to aid Arvire against the Romans. They must bring Arvire back with them to lead the army. Vellinus even claims that he himself has fought the Romans and freed Arvire's wife. Arvire is delighted and eagerly leaves with Vellinus.|$|E

Canada's Mellisa Hollingsworth had the fastest women's practice runs while her teammate Montgomery had the fastest men's practice runs.

500|$|However, {{some critics}} {{consider}} Moonraker {{one of the}} lesser films in the series, {{largely due to the}} extent of the plot which takes James Bond into space, some of the ploys used in the film for comedic effect, and its extended dialogue. In November 2006, Entertainment Weekly ranked Moonraker fourteenth among the Bond films, describing it as [...] "by far the campiest of all 007 movies" [...] with [...] "one of the worst theme songs"; while IGN listed it as eleventh, calling it outlandish and saying that despite the actors [...] "trying what <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> ground the film in reality, the laser gun/space station finale pretty much undercuts their efforts"; and Norman Wilner of MSN chose it as the fourth worst film of the series, considering that the film [...] "just flat-out sucks".|$|E
500|$|That same day, Bloomsbury {{cancelled}} all Asda's {{orders of}} Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, or roughly 500,000 copies, citing unpaid bills {{from the company}} totalling £38,000 ($70,000) for unauthorised returns of the sixth Harry Potter book. [...] "The two matters are completely unrelated", said a Bloomsbury spokeswoman, [...] "We decided today that we couldn't risk having arrears with anybody." [...] The dispute had been [...] "going on a while – going on for weeks actually." [...] Asda responded that Bloomsbury owed them £122,000 ($224,000) ("for pulping and for other book trade issues and work we have done for them") and that, as one company spokesman claimed, [...] "It just seems funny that after we expose the potty Potter price hike, Bloomsbury are trying everything <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> stop kids getting hold of Harry Potter at a price they can afford." ...|$|E

[...] For the most part, Bryan ignored the attacks, and made light of them in his account of the 1896 campaign.

500|$|In medicine, silver is {{incorporated}} into wound dressings {{and used as}} an antibiotic coating in medical devices. Wound dressings containing silver sulfadiazine or silver nanomaterials are used to treat external infections. Silver is also used in some medical applications, such as urinary catheters (where tentative evidence indicates it reduces catheter-related urinary tract infections) and in endotracheal breathing tubes (where evidence suggests it reduces ventilator-associated pneumonia). The silver ion is bioactive and in sufficient concentration readily kills bacteria in vitro. They interfere with enzymes in the bacteria that transport nutrients, form structures, synthesise cell walls, and bond with the bacteria's genetic material. Microbes cannot develop resistance to silver as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> antibiotics, and hence silver and silver nanoparticles are used as an antimicrobial {{in a variety of}} industrial, healthcare, and domestic application: for example, infusing clothing with nanosilver particles thus allows them to stay odourless for longer. Silver compounds are taken up by the body like mercury compounds, but lack the toxicity of the latter. Silver and its alloys are used in cranial surgery to replace bone, and silver–tin–mercury amalgams are used in dentistry. [...] Silver diammine fluoride, the fluoride salt of a coordination complex with the formula F, is a topical medicament (drug) used to treat and prevent dental caries (cavities) and relieve dentinal hypersensitivity.|$|E
