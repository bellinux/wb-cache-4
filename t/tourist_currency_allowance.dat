40|$|The {{sharing economy}} is disrupting long-standing industries! This {{is one of}} the most common phrases used in discussions about any of the booming internet-based {{companies}} offering peer-topeer services. This public perception fed by thousands and thousands of supporting articles and blogs seems intuitively correct. However, the limited number of empirical academic studies published to date, looking only at the direct impacts on the industry under review and ignoring the more holistic indirect economic impacts, have not all reached that same conclusion. In our study we focus on Airbnb, the company that went from renting 3 air beds in a San Francisco apartment in October 2007 to a valuation of $ 25. 5 billion in 2015 surpassing the market cap of the largest global hotel chains that have been around for decades. The purpose of the study is to empirically estimate the impact of Airbnb on hotels in Toronto since majority of the limited academic empirical studies on the topic to date are focused on U. S. cities. Regression analysis of time series is used to estimate the structural models based on hotel performance metrics, GDP, CPI, <b>tourists,</b> <b>currency,</b> and Airbnb data. The three estimated models are: change in real average daily rate, change in hotel rooms available, and change in hotel rooms sold. We project a five-year forecast of Toronto hotels key performance metrics, for the period between January 2016 and December 2020, using the estimated models. The results of the study suggest that Airbnb has a statistically positive impact on the change in number of hotel room nights sold in the overall Toronto market. Taking a closer look into each of the six hotel classes the study hypothesizes that midscale class hotels are the only ones statistically significantly negatively impacted by Airbnb growth. Results also suggest that Airbnb growth has a statistically insignificant impact on the number of luxury, upper upscale, and economy class hotel room nights sold whereas upscale and upper midscale class hotels are positively impacted. We end our study with sensitivity analyses on the forecasts by altering one of the key assumptions at a time and estimating its impact. by Hassan Mohamad. Thesis: S.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the diploma thesis is to complete company guidelines in a chosen company that deals with project and construction activities. The theoretical part contains procedures concerning the internal accounting guidelines and definitions of the legislation of the Czech Republic that influences the creation and composition of individual guidelines. This {{is followed by the}} division of internal guidelines and a detailed analysis of each of them. The chapter is concluded by the importance of guidelines in the company and the formal form of the guidelines. A company may have a large number of guidelines, therefore only the most important ones were chosen in the particular company that are related to the most frequent accounting cases and are, for that reason, problematic. These are guidelines concerning the formation of the account classification, incorporeal and corporeal property, accrual basis of costs and profits, liability reserves, foreign <b>currencies</b> and travelling <b>allowances...</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} this obvious disincentive to compliance with the internal foreign exchange rate regime, the State Bank allowed hard currency to be exchanged for Forum checks - a form of internal currency that (crucially) could be spent at an Intershop. These were a chain of special shops that offered high quality East German goods (that were otherwise difficult to obtain without joining a long waiting list) at reasonable prices and otherwise unobtainable Western consumer goods (usually at near duty-free price levels) - they were accessible only to foreign <b>tourists</b> with hard <b>currency</b> and East German citizens with Forum checks. Forum Checks were purchased at the unrealistic rate of 1 East German Mark for 1 Deutschmark - the typical black market exchange rate varied from 5 - 10 East German Marks to the Deutschmark.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the luxury}} market has entered {{a period of}} very modest growth, which has been dubbed the ‘new normal’, where varying <b>tourist</b> flows, <b>currency</b> fluctuations, and shifted {{consumer}} tastes dictate the terms. The modern luxury consumer is a fickle mistress. Especially millennials – people born in the 1980 s and 1990 s – are the embodiment of this new form of demanding luxury consumer with particular tastes and values. Modern consumers, and specifically millennials, want experiences and free time, and are interested in a brand’s societal position and environmental impact. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate what the luxury value perceptions of millennials in higher education are in Europe, seeing {{as many of the}} most prominent luxury goods companies in the world originate from Europe. Perceived luxury value is herein examined from the individual’s perspective. As values and value perceptions are complex constructs, using qualitative research methods is justifiable. The data for thesis has been gathered by means of a group interview. The interview participants all study hospitality management in a private college, and each represent a different nationality. Cultural theories and research on luxury and luxury values provide the scientific foundation for this thesis, and a multidimensional luxury value model is used as a theoretical tool in sorting and analyzing the data. The results show that millennials in Europe value much more than simply modern and hard luxury. Functional, financial, individual, and social aspects are all present in perceived luxury value, but some more in a negative sense than others. Conspicuous, status-seeking consumption is mostly frowned upon, as is the consumption of luxury goods for the sake of satisfying social requisites and peer pressure. Most of the positive value perceptions are attributed to the functional dimension, as luxury products are seen to come with a promise of high quality and reliability, which justifies any price premiums. Ecological and ethical aspects of luxury are already a contemporary trend, but perceived even more as an important characteristic of luxury in the future. Most importantly, having time is fundamental. Depending on who is asked, luxury can mean anything, just as much as it can mean nothing...|$|R
40|$|Anthropologies of {{development}} traditionally focus on fields like health, education, or agriculture, rarely considering tourism as part {{of development}}. However, local stakeholders in to-be-developed-localities are often excited {{about the possibility of}} drawing international <b>tourists</b> (and foreign <b>currencies)</b> to their region. A global issue like development through tourism becomes a proper object of ethnographic study because it is inseparable of the located re/dis/connections that form it; sometimes displacing it, sometimes diverting it. Tourism development is now commonly seen as one of the exemplary manifestations of global flows that blur traditional territorial, social, and cultural boundaries, and create hybrid forms. Tourism is not only a product of the tensions of global modernity; it is actually difficult to imagine a modernity without it, since tourism contributes precisely to a sense of ‘being modern’. As such, it is not merely emblematic, but an important vector in shaping modernity. Tourism destinations are spaces where modernity meets itself in many shapes and forms; they are places of possibility where roles are changed and identities are experimented with. By way of a case study, this paper focuses on the liminal position of local tour guides, often the only local people with whom tourists interact for a considerable amount of time. This encounter privileges them within local communities and makes them frontrunners of modernity, often in the guise of modernization. They show others how tourism can become one’s ticket to modernity, a path to a more comfortable life, and what one actually does when one becomes modern. The successful mediation between host and guest cultures not only implies a profound transformation of the local guides’ own identities but also indirectly stimulates modifications of the cultures to which they bring foreign tourists. Their practices and discourses shape an officially invisible but fully lived ‘local’, a powerful social imaginary which influences tourists as much as it changes locals. While illustrating these theoretical points with ethnographic examples from the Maasai culture in Tanzania, the paper ends with a reflection on the wider implications this study has for our theorizing of development and social change. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The single European {{currency}} has direct (elimination of currency-exchange costs, {{low interest}} on borrowed capital, stable nominal exchange rates between EMU participants) and indirect effects (on real income and growth) on European tourism: • Following {{the introduction of}} the single <b>currency,</b> <b>tourists</b> will no longer be burdened with the costs of currency exchange and therefore feel a positive income effect. Hence, they will have a larger disposable budget, which may result in higher demand for other goods and services. However, besides these positive effects on income, there will also be a shift in demand, with destinations within EMU becoming cheaper relative to those outside EMU. Demand for destinations within the euro zone from outside EMU may tend to increase, although the effects are expected to be fairly insignificant on account of the relative price decline. • The creation of EMU results in a one-time drop of long-term interest rates. In the field of tourism, a lowering of interest rates would grant the small and medium-sized businesses of the hotel and catering sector, many of them highly in debt, some financial breathing space. This might result in more capital spending and an increased competitiveness. • In the field of tourism, the exchange-rate turbulence of the 1990 s have had a noticeable influence on the development of market shares. Owing to {{the introduction of the}} single European currency, shifts of international travel flows under the impact of exchange rate fluctuations will no longer occur in the euro zone. Hence, price-related influences of travel flows within the euro zone will only be due to regional price differences, which are, however, limited to a relatively narrow margin on account of the stability pact. Austrian tourism, in particular, will benefit from the single currency, since soft-currency countries are expected to experience comparatively stronger price increases. Stable exchange rates also eliminate the need for rate hedging, which in turn may induce travel operators to offer their products at lower prices. • The establishment of the European Monetary Union with a single currency and a central monetary policy results in a higher level of efficiency and capital accumulation than can ever be achieved in a situation with different currencies, which in turn generates higher economic growth and stimulates activities in tourism. To assess the effects of the establishment of EMU, a forecasting model designed for international tourism was used; the baseline version of the forecast was compared with the hypothetical case of non-establishment of EMU (simulation version). An attempt was made to identify the effects of EMU by looking at the development of the balance of tourism for the period from 1999 to 2003 relative to GDP. Under the impact of EMU, Austria will achieve an increase of its cumulative balance of tourist travel by 1. 5 percent of GDP and, hence, be among the clear winners of EMU in this respect, besides Germany and France. The biggest hypothetical losses due to the introduction of the single currency will be suffered by Finland and Italy (– 1. 3 percent and – 1. 2 percent of GDP, respectively). In general, an analysis of cumulative balances shows that the hard-currency countries will benefit from EMU, while the soft-currency countries have to expect some losses.
