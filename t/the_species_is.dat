5|$|A. ocellatus is {{native to}} Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, and French Guiana, and occurs in the Amazon River basin, along the Amazon, Içá, Negro, Solimões, and Ucayali River systems, {{and also in the}} Approuague and Oyapock River drainages. In its natural environment, the species {{typically}} occurs in slow-moving white-water habitats, and has been observed sheltering under submerged branches. Feral populations also occur in China, northern Australia, and Florida, USA as a byproduct of the ornamental fish trade. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> limited in its distribution by its intolerance of cooler water temperatures, the lower lethal limit for <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> 12.9°C (55.22°F).|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera {{has been}} widely grown as an {{ornamental}} plant. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> popular with modern gardeners as a putatively medicinal plant and for its interesting flowers, form, and succulence. This succulence enables the species to survive in areas of low natural rainfall, making it ideal for rockeries and other low water-use gardens. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> hardy in zones 8–11, and is intolerant of heavy frost and snow. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> relatively resistant to most insect pests, though spider mites, mealy bugs, scale insects, and aphid species may cause a decline in plant health. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> endemic, <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} not threatened, but in Western Australia, the twenty-eight subspecies (B. z. semitorquatus) gets locally {{displaced by}} the introduced rainbow lorikeets that aggressively compete for nesting places. The rainbow lorikeet is considered a pest species in Western Australia and is subject to eradication in the wild.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} to be endangered in the Czech Republic, Norway, and in Flanders, Belgium. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> gained vulnerable status in Poland. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>are</b> almost wiped out in Serbia.|$|R
30|$|Etymology: <b>The</b> new <b>species</b> <b>is</b> {{named after}} <b>the</b> country of Argentina, where <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>was</b> collected.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>was</b> first {{formally}} {{described by}} botanist Stephan Endlicher in 1837 as Leptospermum angustifolium. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>was</b> transferred to <b>the</b> genus Hypocalymma in 1843 by Johannes Schauer.|$|R
5|$|Apart from {{underwater}} ecosystem, Weh {{island is}} the only habitat of one threatened species of toad, Duttaphrynus valhallae (formerly Bufo valhallae). <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> only known from the holotype from the island. Due to heavy forestation on the island, the survival of <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Belgium: <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> {{known from}} the 31 of July 2011 in two places around the city of Rochefort.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria: <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> {{known from}} six localities {{in the south}} and west of the country; the first record dates from 2003. Habitats include river and {{mountain}} forests.|$|E
50|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>are</b> from Europe and {{temperate}} Asia {{although a}} few are from North America and North Africa. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>are</b> placed in Matricaria by some authors.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>was</b> {{formally}} {{described in}} 1991. The type specimen was collected in Montrose in Victoria's Dandenong Ranges. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>was</b> previously {{included in a}} wider circumscription of Dipodium punctatum.|$|R
50|$|The family {{contains}} almost 400 {{species in}} five genera, {{but most of}} <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>are</b> found in <b>the</b> genus Xyris (see also Abolboda). <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>are</b> mostly tropical and subtropical.|$|R
5|$|Conservation of A.viridimontanum is {{primarily}} limited by its restricted habitat on serpentine cliffs and talus slopes. However, these sites are also of little value to humans. The most likely threat to <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> expansion of asbestos mining, which often occurs near {{populations of the}} fern, or other reuse of abandoned asbestos mines. Road construction might also threaten some sites, although this is mitigated by the fern's ability to flourish on disturbed serpentine. None of the sites are as yet known to be invaded by non-native plants. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> considered more difficult to cultivate than either of its parent species.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium has a NatureServe {{conservation}} status of G5, meaning that <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> {{considered to be}} ecologically secure by NatureServe, lacking any threats to its global abundance.|$|E
5|$|Galiella rufa {{is found}} in Midwest and eastern North America, and has been {{collected}} in areas between New York and Minnesota, Missouri and North Carolina. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> also found in Malaysia.|$|E

5|$|In a new classification, <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> called Lontra canadensis, {{where the}} genus Lontra {{includes}} all the New World river otters.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} {{mycorrhizal}} association with willow trees, {{and it is}} for this that <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> named. However, particular species favoured by the fungus are unclear and may include beech and alder taxa. The mushrooms grow from the ground, often among mosses or detritus. I.saliceticola was first described in 2009, and within the genus Inocybe, <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> a part of the section Marginatae. The species has been recorded in Finland and Sweden and is relatively common in some areas.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the main}} cause of drastic {{reduction}} of <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> likely caused by the Allee effect.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>are</b> {{variously}} {{distributed in}} <b>the</b> Americas. Some <b>species</b> <b>are</b> used for lumber.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>was</b> {{formally}} {{described in}} 1859 by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller, {{who gave it}} the name Celastrus bilocularis. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>was</b> transferred to <b>the</b> genus Maytenus in 1942.|$|R

5|$|The Mexican fishery for the California {{spiny lobster}} {{was the first}} Latin American fishery to be awarded the Marine Stewardship Council's {{sustainable}} fishery ecolabel, and <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} was {{the first}} to describe the Ross seal, which it found in the pack ice, to which <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> confined.|$|E
5|$|The genus name Spongiforma {{refers to}} the sponge-like nature of the fruit body, while the {{specific}} epithet thailandica denotes {{the country in which}} <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> found.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>was</b> first {{formally}} {{described by}} botanist Diederich von Schlechtendal in 1847 in Linnaea. He {{gave it the}} name Loudonia behrii. In 1970 <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>was</b> transferred to <b>the</b> genus Glischrocaryon.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>were</b> first {{discovered}} by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1792, in Eastern Anatolia. Throughout time, <b>the</b> <b>species</b> have <b>been</b> discovered in South England and Ireland, and also, in countries of Central Europe, such as: North Germany, and Hungary. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>were</b> {{also found in}} Scandinavia, especially in countries like Sweden, and Finland.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>was</b> named Eremophila pachyphylla by Ludwig Diels who was {{apparently}} unaware that <b>the</b> <b>species</b> had <b>been</b> described earlier.|$|R
5|$|The known {{range of}} Boletopsis nothofagi {{is limited to}} two {{narrowly}} defined areas of New Zealand, one on the North Island {{and the other on}} the South Island. These areas are in Rimutaka Forest Park near Wellington, and Saint Arnaud {{in the northern part of}} the South Island. These locations are relatively far away from each other and isolated, which, together with its absence in the rest of New Zealand, makes it unlikely that <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> a recent import. It is more likely that <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> native to New Zealand and has been overlooked in earlier surveys due to its rarity.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of native people in areas surrounding the francolin's range believe that <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> important, {{either because of}} its meat, which may be eaten by the Muslims who comprise the predominant religious group of the region, or because {{it is part of}} the natural heritage of the region. While <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> rarely eaten today due to its rarity, decades ago the species was so common that it was easily captured when it approached nearby villages.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting inhabits a range {{along the}} east coast of Australia from Cape York, Queensland, southward along the coast and the Great Barrier Reef to eastern Victoria and {{the east coast of}} Tasmania down to Southport. The species also inhabits a number of islands; Lord Howe Island, New Caledonia, and Woodlark Island, Papua New Guinea. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> most {{abundant}} in lower Queensland and New South Wales, where studies show it inhabits every estuary sampled throughout the course of a study, while in north Queensland, <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>is</b> very patchily distributed along the coast.|$|E
50|$|The {{first report}} of <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>was</b> first {{made in a}} posting to the Nathistory-India, an {{electronic}} mailing list in 1996. It was only in 2006, however that <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>was</b> formally described.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>was</b> {{formally}} {{described in}} 1839 based on plant material {{collected in the}} Swan River Colony. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>was</b> transferred to <b>the</b> genus Billardiera in 1972 but this was reversed in 2004.|$|R
