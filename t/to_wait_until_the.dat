5|$|It {{was also}} {{realized}} that the beta decay of 239Np must produce an isotope of element 94 (now called plutonium), but the quantities involved in McMillan and Abelson's original experiment were too small to isolate and identify plutonium along with neptunium.

5|$|Although congressional Republicans {{had opposed}} Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of the}} 1994 Contract with America was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> next election season.|$|E

To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E
5|$|In 1530, Mingyi Nyo's son 14-year-old Tabinshwehti succeeded him as king. Toungoo's {{stability}} {{continued to}} attract manpower {{from the surrounding}} regions, especially after 1533 when the Confederation sacked its erstwhile ally Prome. The tiny Toungoo was now the only ethnic Burman-led kingdom, and one surrounded by much larger kingdoms. Fortunately for Toungoo, the Confederation was distracted by internal leadership disputes, and Hanthawaddy, then the most powerful kingdom of all post-Pagan kingdoms, was weakly led. Tabinshwehti decided not <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> larger kingdoms' attention turned to him.|$|E

5|$|Vainio {{was called}} up in 1957 for {{service in the}} Finnish army. He was 19 years old and in the {{penultimate}} grade of gymnasium. However, {{he did not want}} to start his military service right after the matriculation exams, because he wanted to find a profession first. The next spring, the last year of gymnasium, he decided to go to Paris for the holidays with his friend Pekka. Vainio was supposed to pass his matriculation exams in the spring of 1959, but he failed the Swedish exam and had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> autumn to pass it.|$|E
5|$|A {{product of}} Brommapojkarna's academy, he played two senior {{seasons with the}} club before leaving for IFK Göteborg in 2013. With an injury-filled first year, his {{breakthrough}} had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 2014 season, {{in which he was}} named the best left back of the campaign. A move to Copenhagen followed in January 2015 for an estimated record fee of €1.4 million. He has ended up being club champion twice, with Copenhagen in the 2015–16 season and 2016–17 season, and runner-up three times with his teams; in Superettan 2012, Allsvenskan 2014 and in Danish Superliga 2014–15.

However, the Cabinet approved measures that summer, including increased price supports for butter and turkeys, and raises for federal employees. Once the 23rd Canadian Parliament was opened on October 14 by Queen Elizabeth II — {{the first to}} be opened by any Canadian monarch — the government rapidly passed legislation, including tax cuts and increases in old age pensions.

5|$|Lucas {{explained}} that he had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> mid-1980s to make the film because visual effects technology was finally advanced enough to execute his vision. Meanwhile, actor-turned-director Ron Howard was looking to do a fantasy film. He was at Industrial Light & Magic during the post-production phase of Cocoon, {{when he was first}} approached by Lucas to direct Willow. He had previously starred in Lucas' American Graffiti, and Lucas felt that he and Howard shared a symbiotic relationship similar to the one he enjoyed with Steven Spielberg. Howard nominated Bob Dolman to write the screenplay based on Lucas' story. Dolman had worked with him on a 1983 television pilot called Little Shots that had not resulted in a series, and Lucas admired Dolman's work on the sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{season the}} Thistles won the Stirling Cup as champions of western Canada, which allowed {{them the right}} to challenge for the Cup again. However there was an early spring that year, and with natural ice used at the time, the series had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> following winter. In the 1907 season, he led the league in both goals and points, with eighteen. In the Thistles' successful Stanley Cup challenge against the Montreal Wanderers in January 1907, he scored all four goals in the Thistles' 4–2 victory and three in the second game, a 6–5 victory. The team would lose the Cup in a challenge series to the Wanderers two months later. In the two series, Phillips' nine goals, nine points and sixteen penalty minutes were all leaders in those categories.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} force left Bremerhaven {{early on}} 8 April 1940, bound for Kristiansand. When they arrived, a heavy fog obscured the city, making {{the passage of}} the fjord outside the harbor very dangerous. As a result, they had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> following morning to begin the attack. As Karlsruhe entered the fjord, she came under heavy fire from the Norwegian coastal guns at Odderøya Fortress. The cruiser turned in the fjord to bring her full broadside into action; the artillery duel lasted for about two hours before heavy fog again covered the port, forcing both sides to cease fire. The Norwegians surrendered an hour later, and the German ships landed their soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Unmanned {{boats were}} the first vessels to enter the lagoon. Onboard {{instruments}} allowed remote-controlled radiation measurements to be made. When support ships entered the lagoon for evaluation, decontamination, and salvage activities, they steered clear of lagoon water hot spots detected by the drone boats. The standard for radiation exposure to personnel {{was the same as}} that used by the Manhattan Project: 0.1 roentgens per day. Because of this constraint, only the five most distant target ships could be boarded on the first day. The closer-in ships were hosed down by Navy fireboats using saltwater and flame retardants. The first hosing reduced radioactivity by half, but subsequent hosings were ineffective. For most of the ships, reboarding had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> short-lived radioisotopes decayed; ten days elapsed before the last of the targets could be boarded.|$|E
5|$|Washington again {{proposed}} to assault Boston in October, but his officers {{thought it best}} <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> harbor had frozen over. In February, when the water had frozen between Roxbury and Boston Common, Washington thought {{that in spite of}} his shortage in powder he would try an assault by rushing across the ice; but his officers again advised against it. Washington's desire to launch an attack on Boston arose from his fear that his army would desert in the winter, and how easily he knew that Howe could break the lines of his army in its present condition. He had not yet learned how completely he could trust in Howe's inactivity; he abandoned an attack across the ice with great reluctance in exchange for a more cautious plan, to fortify Dorchester Heights using cannon arrived from Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E

He arrived with some of his staff on 13 August, but had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> rest arrived before he could formally assume command of Milne Force on 22 August. By this time there were 7,459 Australian and 1,365 US Army personnel at Milne Bay, of whom about 4,500 were infantry. There were also about 600 RAAF personnel.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{engagement}} at Wisconsin Heights, the militia decided <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> following day to pursue Black Hawk. They heard, {{but did not}} understand, Neapope's speech during the night, and to their surprise, when morning arrived their enemy had disappeared. The battle, though militarily devastating for the British Band, had allowed much of the group to escape to temporary safety across the Wisconsin River. The reprieve was short-lived for many – a group of Fox {{women and children who}} attempted to escape down the Wisconsin following the battle were captured by U.S.-allied tribes or shot by soldiers further downstream. During the night, while the non-combatants escaped in canoes, Black Hawk and the remaining warriors crossed the river near present-day Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin. The band fled west over rugged terrain toward the banks of the Mississippi River, with a week's head start on the militia.|$|E
5|$|He became pope in 1534 {{when he was}} 66 years old, and {{immediately}} appointed {{members of his family}} to key positions. He anointed his eldest grandson Alessandro, the eldest child of his illegitimate son Pier Luigi, cardinal at the age of 14, marking a break with the Farnese tradition of marrying off the first-born to carry on the family name. This move was considered necessary because the next oldest grandson, Ottavio, was then just 10 years old; such a young cardinal would have been politically unacceptable. Paul's advanced years meant that the family could ill afford <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> younger brother was of age. Thus Alessandro became a cardinal deacon; this appointment did not necessitate taking major orders, but it compelled him to celibacy and to forgo the rights of primogeniture, which instead went to Ottavio. Alessandro was to bitterly regret the obligations. Paul appointed Ottavio as Duke of Camerino in 1538, and in the same year married him to Charles V's daughter, Margaret, later Margaret of Parma. Both of Paul's grandsons' advancements were widely criticised as evidence of nepotism.|$|E
