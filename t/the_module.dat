5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of <b>the</b> <b>module,</b> an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of <b>the</b> <b>module,</b> and an operation which takes {{an element of the}} ring and an element of <b>the</b> <b>module</b> and returns an element of <b>the</b> <b>module.</b> The underlying set of <b>the</b> <b>module</b> and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E
5|$|Although the Realms were {{yet to be}} an {{official}} campaign world, <b>the</b> <b>module</b> , released in 1985 by TSR, is now {{considered to be a}} part of the Forgotten Realms, although it wasn't until module H3 The Bloodstone Wars was released that Forgotten Realms became the official setting for <b>the</b> <b>module</b> series.

5|$|In {{addition}} to module-specific equipment, Kvant-2, Kristall, Spektr and Priroda were each equipped with one Lyappa arm, a robotic arm which, after <b>the</b> <b>module</b> had docked {{to the core}} module's forward port, grappled one of two fixtures positioned on the core module's docking node.

30|$|The {{four main}} {{blocks of the}} mind are <b>the</b> {{recognition}} <b>module,</b> <b>the</b> predecision <b>module,</b> <b>the</b> decision <b>module,</b> and <b>the</b> execution <b>module.</b> <b>The</b> recognition <b>module</b> {{is responsible for the}} processing of incoming sensory data in order to perceive the environment and internal states of the body. <b>The</b> pre-decision <b>module</b> and <b>the</b> decision <b>module</b> are responsible for deciding what actions to take based on all available incoming information.

5|$|The second {{expedition}} to Mir, EO-2, launched on Soyuz TM-2 on 5 February 1987. During their stay, the Kvant-1 module, launched on 30 March 1987, arrived.

Kvant-1 was originally planned to dock with Salyut 7; due to technical problems during its development, it was reassigned to Mir. <b>The</b> <b>module</b> carried {{the first set of}} six gyroscopes for attitude control. <b>The</b> <b>module</b> also carried instruments for X-ray and ultraviolet astrophysical observations.|$|E

5|$|Tomb of Horrors is an {{adventure}} module written by Gary Gygax for the Dungeons & Dragons (D) role-playing game. It was originally written for and {{used at the}} 1975 Origins1 convention. Gygax designed the adventure both to challenge the skill of expert players in his own campaign, and to test players who boasted of having mighty player characters able to best any challenge. <b>The</b> <b>module,</b> coded S1, {{was the first in}} the S-series, or special series of modules. Several versions of the adventure have been published, the first in 1978, and the most recent, for the fifth edition of D, in 2017 as one of the included adventures in Tales from the Yawning Portal. <b>The</b> <b>module</b> also served as the basis for a novel published in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The orbital {{assembly}} of Mir began on February 19, 1986 with {{the launch of}} the Proton-K rocket.

Firstly, <b>the</b> <b>module</b> would be launched independently on its own Proton-K and chase the station automatically.

40|$|Self-organization is a {{phenomenon}} found in biomolecular self-assembly by which proteins are spontaneously driven to assemble and attain various functionalities. This study reports on self-organized behavior in which distributed centimeter-sized modules stochastically aggregate and exhibit a translational wheeling motion. The system consists of two types of centimeter-sized water-floating modules: a triangular-shaped module that {{is equipped with a}} vibration motor and a permanent magnet (termed <b>the</b> active <b>module),</b> which can quasi-randomly rove around; and circular modules that are equipped with permanent magnets (termed passive modules). In its quasi-random movement in water, <b>the</b> active <b>module</b> picks up passive modules through magnetic attraction. The contacts between <b>the</b> <b>modules</b> induce a torque transfer from <b>the</b> active <b>module</b> to <b>the</b> passive <b>modules.</b> This results in rotational motion of <b>the</b> passive <b>modules.</b> As a consequence of the shape difference between <b>the</b> triangular <b>module</b> and <b>the</b> circular <b>module,</b> <b>the</b> passive <b>modules</b> rotate like wheels, being kept on the same edges as <b>the</b> active <b>module.</b> <b>The</b> motion of <b>the</b> active <b>module</b> is examined, as well as the characteristics and behavior of the self-organization process.
