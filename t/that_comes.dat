40|$|Abstract : This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to provide support}} for the prediction that familiarity of words in contexts affects the degree of hyper/hypo-articulation of vowels in these words. Results from the present analysis show that the repetition of words in a story causes hypoarticulation of vowels in these words. Among the eight types of vowels whose F 1 and F 2 values are measured, two types of vowels in words <b>that</b> <b>come</b> {{for the second time}} in a context show hypoarticulation to a much higher degree than those in words <b>that</b> <b>come</b> for the first time. One type of vowel in the words <b>that</b> <b>come</b> for the second time shows more partial hypoarticulation than that in the words <b>that</b> <b>come</b> for the first time. Three types of vowels show almost the same F 1 and F 2 values in both cases. A vowel space with four corner vowels in the words <b>that</b> <b>come</b> for the second time is smaller than that in words <b>that</b> <b>come</b> for the first time, which also indicates a tendency toward hypoarticulation for vowels in words repeated after their first introduction. 　　Keywords: formant, hypoarticulation, repetition, space, vowe...|$|R
