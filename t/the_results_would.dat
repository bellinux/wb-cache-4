5|$|The {{election}} {{was conducted by}} voice vote, a qualified elector would tell the returning officer at a polling station who {{he was going to}} vote for and <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>would</b> be tallied. Under the terms of the Act eligible electors were males who had reached the age of majority, which was 21 years of age at that time. The act specified that electors must be bona fide males who were not aliens or unenfranchised Indians. Electors must also have resided in the territory for at least 12 months to the day of the writ being dropped.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, the Lithuanian {{government}} {{discussed the}} new developments. It decided that Merkys {{should return to}} Kaunas and Urbšys should deliver a note offering withdrawal from the Baltic Entente, a full investigation of the incident, and dismissal of Skučas and Povilaitis. A personal letter from President Antanas Smetona to Chairman of Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Mikhail Kalinin repeated assurances that Lithuania always honored the mutual assistance pact. The third and final meeting between Merkys, Urbšys, and Molotov on June 11 brought no resolution. The Soviets continued to press charges which the Lithuanians could not meaningfully answer and made no more actionable requests. On June 12, Merkys returned to Lithuania and informed {{the government of the}} situation. It was decided that Skučas should resign and Povilaitis would be immediately dismissed. The Lithuanian Army was ordered to be alert, but no orders were issued regarding mobilization or preparedness. Lithuanian politicians did not fully understand the gravity of the situation and did not think <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>would</b> be catastrophic. Urbšys reported that the Soviets strongly disapproved of Merkys and his cabinet; he suggested that a new government be installed, possibly led by Stasys Raštikis, former Commander-in-Chief of the Lithuanian Army. Such suggestion interfered with Lithuania's domestic affairs.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the first}} round of auditions was completed, the series moved to the Criterion Theatre, where further auditions saw the judges decide on a group of 50.

25|$|One of the {{interesting}} coincidences {{of the war was}} that the Germans had already developed their own version of chaff under the code-name Düppel, and had tested it near Berlin and over the Baltic. However, Hermann Göring was worried that if they used Düppel over the UK, the RAF would quickly copy the concept and use it against them. As Bomber Command's fleet was rapidly growing, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>would</b> likely be greatly in the RAF's favour. Learning from past mistakes when older material had leaked, Göring had most of the paperwork on Düppel destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Proponents {{argue that}} Interlingua's source {{languages}} {{include not only}} Romance languages but English, German, and Russian as well. Moreover, the source languages are widely spoken internationally, and large numbers of their words also appear in other languages – still more when derivative forms and loan translations are included. Tests had shown that if {{a larger number of}} source languages were used, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>would</b> be about the same. So, IALA selected a much simpler extraction procedure for Interlingua with little adverse effect on its internationality.|$|E

25|$|Räikkönen's Drivers' Championship {{was briefly}} put into doubt when race {{stewards}} began an investigation after identifying possible fuel irregularities in the cars of Nico Rosberg, Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld following post-race inspection. Their disqualification and a race reclassification {{would have seen}} Hamilton lifted from seventh to fourth in the race result. However the race stewards decided that no sanctions would be given, meaning <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>would</b> stand. McLaren appealed against the decision, however the FIA Court of Appeal rejected their appeal on 16 November 2007 thus confirming Räikkönen as the champion.|$|E
25|$|A {{construction}} {{site for a}} section of the new line was announced publicly on 30 March 1999. The Planungsgesellschaft Bahnbau Deutsche Einheit justified this {{in the absence of a}} financial agreement with the federal government. About DM 650million had previously been invested by the company in the project. The Federal Ministry of Transport and Communications emphasised that the project would be re-examined and that <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>would</b> be available within weeks. At the end of May 1999, it became apparent that the project would not be realised in the planned form, especially due to the substitution of cheaper materials.|$|E
25|$|The {{air pump}} used {{must be able}} to deliver the volume {{required}} at the pressure required. Most flow testing is done at 10 and 28inches of water pressure (2.5 to 7 kilopascals). Although other test pressures will work, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>would</b> have to be converted for comparison to the work of others. The pressure developed must account for the test pressure plus the loss across the metering element plus all other system losses. The greater the accuracy of the metering element the greater is the loss. Flow volume of between 100 and 600 cubic feet per minute (0.05 to 0.28 m³/s) would serve almost all applications {{depending on the size of}} the engine under test.|$|E

25|$|The hidden {{variables}} theory fails, however, when {{we consider}} measurements of the spin of entangled particles along different axes (for example, along any of three axes that make angles of 120 degrees). If {{a large number of}} pairs of such measurements are made (on a large number of pairs of entangled particles), then statistically, if the local realist or hidden variables view were correct, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>would</b> always satisfy Bell's inequality. A number of experiments have shown in practice that Bell's inequality is not satisfied. However, all experiments have loophole problems. When measurements of the entangled particles are made in moving relativistic reference frames, in which each measurement (in its own relativistic time frame) occurs before the other, the measurement results remain correlated.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} week the Gold Coast recorded their first ever victory during a 134-point annihilation of the Western Jets. The team {{went on to}} record 10 wins in their following 15 matches. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>would</b> see the Gold Coast finish fifth on the ladder and earn them {{a spot in the}} finals. A top of the table clash in the last round saw GCFC blow a crucial double chance for the finals with a loss to the Geelong Falcons. GCFC would come out victorious in their elimination final against the Northern Knights. The dream season came to an end the {{following week}} in the semi finals against the Geelong Falcons. Captain Marc Lock was awarded the club's inaugural best and fairest medal {{at the conclusion of the}} season.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{philosophers}} {{of science}} argue that while causal determinism {{in which everything}} including the brain/mind {{is subject to the}} laws of causality is compatible with minds capable of science, fatalism and predestination is not. These philosophers make the distinction that causal determinism means that each step is determined by the step before and therefore allows sensory input from observational data to determine what conclusions the brain reaches, while fatalism in which the steps between do not connect an initial cause to <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>would</b> make it impossible for observational data to correct false hypotheses. This is often combined with the argument that if the brain had fixed views and the arguments were mere after-constructs with no causal effect on the conclusions, science would have been impossible and the use of arguments would have been a meaningless waste of energy with no persuasive effect on brains with fixed views.|$|E

25|$|The main mode of {{retrieving}} {{data from}} a SQL Server database is querying for it. The query is expressed using a variant of SQL called T-SQL, a dialect Microsoft SQL Server shares with Sybase SQL Server due to its legacy. The query declaratively specifies {{what is to be}} retrieved. It is processed by the query processor, which figures out the sequence of steps that will be necessary to retrieve the requested data. The sequence of actions necessary to execute a query is called a query plan. There might be multiple ways to process the same query. For example, for a query that contains a join statement and a select statement, executing join on both the tables and then executing select on <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>would</b> give the same result as selecting from each table and then executing the join, but result in different execution plans. In such case, SQL Server chooses the plan that is expected to yield the results in the shortest possible time. This is called query optimization and is performed by the query processor itself.|$|E
25|$|On 11 October 2009 the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) {{announced}} that {{the format of the}} semi-finals was to be changed so that <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>would</b> be determined by a combination of 50% national jury and 50% televoting, making it more consistent with the final. Each country's votes were determined by combining the jury votes and the televoting results; the countries with the top ten highest points in each semi-final then qualify to participate in the final of the contest. This replaces the semi-final format used in the 2008 and 2009 contests in which the countries with the top nine highest points from the televoting results in each semi-final qualified for the final. The tenth semi-final place was then given to the country with the highest number of points from the jury's votes which had not already qualified for the final from the televoting results. On 26 October 2009 the EBU {{announced that}} the voting would be open throughout the competition and would conclude 15 minutes {{after the end of the}} very last song.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} four games, the outcome was all but decided {{by the end of}} the first quarter. In the gold medal game against Canada, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>would</b> be very different. Canada entered the game with a 4–0 record, the same as the USA team. The game started with low scoring, neither team {{managing}} to reach double digits in the quarter. At the end of the first quarter the teams were tied 9–9. The scoring picked up in the second quarter, but by both teams. The USA team, after hitting only 3 of their first 16 field goal attempts, went on a 10–0 run to take an eight-point lead, but Canada did not fold, and responded to tie the game. The teams were tied at 27 points each at halftime. The teams traded baskets early in the third period, but then the USA went on a 22–0 run to take a large lead. The USA extended the lead until it reached 38 points in the fourth quarter. Canada out scored the USA over the final minutes, but the game was out of reach, and the USA went on to win the game 82–48, and the gold medal. Asia Durr was named the tournament MVP. She had set three single game records for the U16 tournament, including most points, 26, most steals, 8, and most field goal attempts 22. Teammate Katie Lou Samuelson also set a record. She hit 8 three pointers on only eight attempts in the final game, to set a record for three pointers made and three point shooting percentage for a game.|$|E
