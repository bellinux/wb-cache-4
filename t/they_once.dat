Derry again lost to Galway, despite a goal scored by Muldoon. Muldoon scored 2-10 (16) in that year's Championship. Muldoon was named Derry captain for the 2003 season.|$|E

5|$|In winter, the {{resident}} bird population is increased by visitors from north-east Europe, {{in particular the}} widgeon and Greenland white-fronted goose. Riverside mammals are seen frequently and otters, mink and fox are common. Trout and salmon are less common in the Shannon than <b>they</b> <b>once</b> were, however pike is still plentiful and attracts many anglers.|$|E

5|$|Murray cod {{populations have}} {{declined}} severely since European colonisation of Australia {{due to a}} number of causes, including severe overfishing, river regulation, and habitat degradation and are now a listed threatened species.

5|$|On 11 October 1941, the {{battalion}} entrained at Oakbank {{and began the}} journey north. They detrained at Alice Springs, where they camped overnight before continuing the journey by road in a 44-vehicle convoy, which took them further north to Larrimah. There <b>they</b> <b>once</b> again entrained for the final journey to Winnellie, which they reached on 19 October, after overnighting in Katherine.|$|E

5|$|After the one {{surviving}} roll from Henry I's reign, {{no further}} Pipe rolls survived from his reign, nor are any preserved from {{the reign of}} his successor, King Stephen (reigned 1135–1154). But by {{the second year of}} King Henry II's reign, or 1155, <b>they</b> <b>once</b> more survive. It is unclear if Pipe rolls were actually created during Stephen's reign and they did not survive, or if the conditions during Stephen's reign precluded the creation of Pipe rolls. Continuously from the early years of King Henry II's reign, most Pipe rolls survive, with only a break {{in the last years of}} King John's reign (reigned 1199–1216).|$|E
5|$|An almost injury-free season helped Shearer {{improve on}} his {{previous}} year's tally in the 1998–99 season, the striker converting 14goals in 30 league games and replacing Rob Lee as Newcastle captain, but Newcastle finished 13th again, with Ruud Gullit having replaced Kenny Dalglish {{just after the}} season got underway. He also helped Newcastle to a second consecutive FA Cup final and qualification for the following season's UEFA Cup, scoring twice in the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, but <b>they</b> <b>once</b> again lost; this time 2–0 to treble-chasing Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|Chappuis {{was rescued}} by an Italian partisan, Aldo Comucci, a 21-year-old {{who was in}} charge of one of the many {{underground}} groups operating in the area. Comucci and his band of resistance fighters got to Chappuis before the Germans and hid him and two other American flyers from the same plane for nearly three months until the end of the war. The partisans passed Chappuis and the two other Americans from house to house, and village to village, toward the Swiss frontier. Dressed in shawls — but still wearing G.I. shoes — <b>they</b> <b>once</b> walked undetected past a German sentry.|$|E

He scored a season-high 23 points two times during the season, and played in all six of the Mavericks' playoff games where <b>they</b> <b>once</b> again lost to the San Antonio Spurs in the first round.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of the new}} routes {{terminated}} at the Anacostia Station {{rather than}} continue into downtown Washington, as <b>they</b> <b>once</b> had. WMATA officials admitted that fares for most Anacostia residents would rise an average of 50 percent, and that Anacostia residents {{would be forced to}} pay more and travel farther to access the services (such as doctors) and shopping that most District residents can readily access. To help mediate the impact of the total fare increase on Anacostia residents, WMATA reduced basic bus fares for many routes in the area from $1 to 35 cents.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of employment. While jobs such as writer, musician and composer exist as they always have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as <b>they</b> <b>once</b> would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as gaffer or special effects supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.|$|E

5|$|The film {{comes to}} an end with Sue {{describing}} the impact of the boys on her life. As she and Sonia watch from the rooftop that Ajay proposed to her on, they have a vision of the boys running in the fields, singing happily and victoriously throwing their shirts in the air, acting as if they are celebrating life itself, as if the ebb of their once-there vitality still reverberates in the places where <b>they</b> <b>once</b> used to go, and a wave of melancholy comes over the two surviving women.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with counselling, {{job training and}} social rehabilitation. It is unclear whether typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. In {{those who do not}} improve with other antipsychotics clozapine may be tried. In more serious situations where there is risk to self or others involuntary hospitalization may be necessary, although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than <b>they</b> <b>once</b> were.|$|E

5|$|After this, the 14th/32nd Battalion {{was moved}} to the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland, to {{undertake}} amphibious landing and jungle warfare training in preparation for deployment overseas. In July 1943, they were sent to Port Moresby, New Guinea, where <b>they</b> <b>once</b> again filled the role of garrison troops for almost a year, operating between Buna, Gona and Nassau Bay. In 1944, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Caldwell, who had previously commanded at company-level in Greece and the Middle East, the battalion was attached to the 5th Division and on 4 November the 14th/32nd Battalion, forming the vanguard of the 6th Brigade, carried out an amphibious landing at Jacquinot Bay on New Britain.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholic {{beverage}} and {{the process}} of fermentation: The earliest archaeological evidence of fermentation and the consumption of alcoholic beverages was discovered in neolithic China dating from 7000–6600 BC. Examination and analysis of ancient pottery jars from the neolithic village of Jiahu in Henan province in northern China revealed fermented residue left behind by the alcoholic beverages <b>they</b> <b>once</b> contained. According to {{a study published in the}} Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, chemical analysis of the residue revealed that the fermented drink was made from fruit, rice and honey. Elsewhere in the world, fermented beverages have been found dating from 6000 BC in Georgia, 3150 BC in ancient Egypt, 3000 BC in Babylon, 2000 BC in pre-Hispanic Mexico, and 1500 BC in Sudan.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{domestic}} decoration, Han artwork {{also served}} an important funerary function. Han artists and craftsmen decorated the wall bricks lining underground tombs {{of the deceased}} with mural paintings and carved reliefs; {{the purpose of this}} artwork was to aid the deceased in traveling through their afterlife journey. Stamping artistic designs into tile and brick was also common. Human figurine sculptures found in Han tombs were placed there to perform various functions for the deceased in the afterlife, such as dancing and playing music for entertainment, as well as serving food. A common type of ceramic figurine found in Han tombs is a female entertainer sporting long, flowing silk sleeves that are flung about while dancing. Some ceramic human figures—both male and female—have been found naked, all with clearly distinguished genitalia and missing arms. This is because <b>they</b> <b>once</b> had wooden or cloth arms which were attached to holes in the shoulders by pegs, as well as miniature clothes made of perishable materials such as silk.|$|E
