25|$|Chief of Staff of the United States Army Harold Keith Johnson, and {{subsequently}} historians such as Harry G. Summers, Jr. came <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>US</b> goals as having become mutually inconsistent, because defeating the Communists would require declaring a national emergency and fully mobilising {{the resources of}} the US. General Johnson was critical of Westmoreland's defused corporate style, considering him overattentive to what government officials wanted to hear. Nonetheless, Westmoreland was operating within longstanding army protocols of subordinating the military to civilian policymakers. The most important constraint was staying on the strategic defensive out of fear of Chinese intervention, {{but at the same time}} President Lyndon B. Johnson had made it clear that there was a higher commitment to defending Vietnam. Much of the thinking about defense was by academics turned government advisors who concentrated on nuclear weapons, seen as making conventional war obsolete. The fashion for counter-insurgency thinking also denigrated the role of conventional warfare. Despite the inconclusive outcome of the Korean War, Americans expected their wars to end with the unconditional surrender of the enemy.|$|E

[...] Flora MacDonald ended up returning to her native Skye in 1779, and when General Charles Cornwallis passed through the Cross Creek area in 1781, he reported that [...] "any of the inhabitants rode into camp, shook me by the hand, said they were glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> and that we had beat Greene and then rode home." ...|$|E

[...] He explained that they always try to do something different: [...] "We've got people still coming <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> for, you know, after ten years, and we just want to try and give something special." [...] On the opening show of the leg, percussionist Crahan debuted a new mask which was significantly different from the one he wore while touring in 2008.|$|E

In other words, we were the typical, cocky Americans no one wants around, until they need help winning a war." ...|$|E
500|$|The Ramones {{began playing}} gigs in mid-1974, {{with their first}} show at Performance Studios in New York City. The band, {{performing}} in a style {{similar to the one}} used on their debut album, typically performed at clubs in downtown Manhattan, specifically CBGB and Max's Kansas City. In early 1975, Lisa Robinson, an editor of Hit Parader and Rock Scene, saw the fledgling Ramones performing at CBGB and subsequently wrote about the band in several magazine issues. The group's vocalist Joey Ramone related that [...] "Lisa came down <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us,</b> she was blown away by us. She said that we changed her life, She started writing about us in Rock Scene, and then Lenny Kaye would write about us and we started getting more press like The Village Voice. Word was getting out, and people starting coming down." [...] Convinced that the band needed a recording contract, Robinson contacted Danny Fields, former manager of the Stooges, and argued that he needed to manage the band. Fields agreed because the band [...] "had everything [...] ever liked," [...] and became the manager in November 1975.|$|E

500|$|... "Immortality" [...] was {{watched by}} about 3.7 million viewers, drawing a 1.4/4 ratings share on its initial broadcast, down 12.5 {{percent from the}} {{previous}} episode's viewership. During the first half hour, the episode placed second in its timeslot, but dropped to fourth for its second half. Its lead-in, Kitchen Nightmares, also dropped 12 percent, as did all other network shows for that night. Time shifting viewing added 57 percent to the episode's ratings for three days out, and 64 percent for a week following the first airing. This was the greatest DVR gain yet for the series in that timeslot. Despite this, Joshua Jackson urged fans to watch the series live {{in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly a week after [...] "Immortality" [...] aired. He explained [...] "I'm a positive person in general, but we really need our Fringe fans to tune in and watch us on Fridays. We did good when we first moved, but last week we did not have a good week, ratings wise. It is going to take the people that like the show to watch the show and start the campaign and show their support if they want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> stick around for another season." ...|$|E
500|$|Media {{reactions}} to the race were positive, with Kevin Eason of The Times saying, [...] "What the inaugural Rockingham 500 CART FedEx race in Britain lacked in quantity, it made up for with driving of the highest quality." [...] He reserved praise for de Ferran's last lap overtake on Bräck, calling it [...] "astonishing". Writing for The Sunday Telegraph, Brough Scott stated, [...] "Births have always come with their share of noise, difficulty, danger and the odd touch of absurdity. But never can all the elements have been mixed as heavily as in yesterday's much-delayed launch of the Rockingham 500, which opened and closed with overtaking manoeuvres dramatic enough to take your breath away." [...] Richard Williams of The Guardian wrote, [...] "the 38,000 people who had battled against uncertainty and Silverstone-style traffic jams <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>US</b> single-seater cars racing on a banked oval track {{for the first time}} in Britain were rewarded with a race that fully reflected the present strengths of a branch of motor sport that can trace its roots back to the first running of the Indianapolis 500 race in 1911." [...] The Associated Press stated that despite the race almost being cancelled it became [...] "one of CART's most dramatic of the season." ...|$|E
500|$|About the {{re-recording}} {{of the old}} songs, Westfall said [...] "We've made a lot {{of changes}} to these songs that we play live [...] and now we're getting a chance to record it, so the people that don't get <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> live can hear it and appreciate it for what it is." [...] On the new tracks, producer Andrew Wade said [...] "I think this new stuff that we're recording is really gonna blow a lot of kids away. [...] just sound amazing, they all sound like completely different songs, and the new song is serious." [...] About the new song, [...] "Why Walk on Water When We've Got Boats", the band wanted to do a fast-paced song. McKinnon admitted the band [...] "kinda just winged it. But we had some little ideas from being on tour and messing around." [...] Woodard said about inspiration for the tempo of the song: [...] "We've all been listening to a lot of faster stuff like Comeback Kid and stuff like that and I don't know and just sitting here one day 'let's write a fast song'." [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] had appeared on the band's Myspace account, on September 21, 2007, as free for download. [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] had overdubs added to it especially for the release on the For Those Who Have Heart reissue.|$|E

On May 15 the campaign released its first ad, which detailed his plan for ending the war in Iraq. In the ad, Dodd also criticized his fellow Democratic candidates by stating, [...] "We can't simply wait for a new president. We should have the conviction to stand up to this one," [...] In Washington, Dodd was exposed to debate on the Iraq War Spending Bill and new videos from al-Qaeda's second in command Ayman al-Zawahiri. Back on the campaign trail he talked about how he would deal with foreign issues particularly in regards to the situation in Iraq, [...] "I'm not going to let my foreign policy be decided by Mr. al-Zawahiri. Obviously, he's playing his game here. He'd probably like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> stay down there, bogged down, at the costs we're increasing here, the loss of lives, not to mention the isolation of the United States." [...] When Presidential candidate John Edwards released an ad criticizing Congress' failure to end the Iraq War, Dodd took it personal and shot back at Edwards stating, [...] ""With all due respect, we could have used John's vote here in the Senate on these issues here." [...] He concluded the May campaign by attending House parties in three cities in New Hampshire[...]|$|E
500|$|For her {{portrayal}} of Valene, Van Ark received two Soap Opera Digest awards {{in the category}} [...] "Outstanding Actress in a Leading Role on a Prime Time Serial". Greg Hernandez said, [...] "Before I go on, I have to confess that I was a die-hard fan of Knots Landing, the series on which Joan played sweet Valene Ewing for 14 years. Her character of Valene was a best-selling author but her personal life was always a mess. She had her husband, Gary, stolen by another woman then got pregnant by him, her twin babies were kidnapped by a crooked doctor, she was given a drug overdose at gunpoint by her ex-husband's fiancee, and she racked up enough marriages to give Elizabeth Taylor a run for her money. But she and Gary Ewing (Ted Shackleford) made for one of television's most beloved couples and the audience never stopped rooting {{for them to get}} back together. Joan keeps in touch with Ted (pictured with Joan, above at a [...] "Knots" [...] reunion a few years back), Michelle Lee - who played her best friend Karen - and the great stage star Julie Harris who played her mother." [...] Knots Landing itself has experienced a tremendous fan following and dedication. Van Ark said of this, [...] "It’s amazing. It’s like having friends everywhere in the United States. I heard that a group a fans from London were coming in just <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> at this (autograph convention). We get a lot of fan mail from Europe – France, Germany, Russia. Knots has a huge following, and I think fans of the show are loving and loyal. Not many shows last 14 years on prime-time. That’s a milestone, and I’m very proud of it." ...|$|E
