5|$|EPA {{published}} in the Federal Register a final rule in 2009. The new rule limits radiation doses from Yucca Mountain for up to 1,000,000 years after it closes. Within that regulatory time frame, <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> two dose standards that would apply {{based on the number}} of years from the time the facility is closed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> {{initiated}} several {{air quality}} requirements that help reduce ground-level ozone {{that leads to}} urban heat islands. In the Clean Air Act, one of the EPA's chief policies, there are certain regulations that are {{put in place to}} ensure the state's emissions stay below a certain level. Included in the Clean Air Act, all states must set forth a State Implementation Plan (SIP) which is designed to guarantee all states meet a central air quality standard.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> the {{authority}} to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, under the Clean Air Act, {{and is one of}} the agency's seven priorities.|$|E
5000|$|On March 17, 2016, McCarthy and Michigan Governor Rick Snyder {{testified before}} the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform {{regarding}} the Flint water crisis. Snyder apologized for the state's mistakes. McCarthy, however, insisted <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> done nothing wrong and that [...] "there is no way my agency created this problem", causing her to at times be shouted down by outraged members of Congress. In October 2016, <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> inspector general concluded that <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> wrongfully delayed issuing an emergency order regarding Flint, Michigan.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>have</b> some {{regulations}} and guidelines for monitoring nitrogen dioxide levels. Historically, some {{states in the}} U.S including Chicago, Northeast corridor and L.A have had high levels of nitrogen dioxide.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> officially removed {{saccharin}} and its salts {{from their}} list of hazardous constituents and commercial chemical products. In a 14 December 2010 release, the EPA stated that saccharin is no longer considered a potential hazard to human health.|$|E
25|$|In 1999 the EPA began cleanup {{efforts in}} Libby {{and now the}} area is a Superfund cleanup area. <b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> {{determined}} that harmful asbestos is released from the mine {{as well as through}} other activities that disturb soil in the area.|$|E
25|$|Los Angeles is {{also home}} to the nation's largest urban oil field. There are more than 700 active oil wells located within 1,500 feet of homes, churches, schools and {{hospitals}} in the city, a situation about which <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> voiced serious concerns.|$|E
50|$|Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, {{and groups}} {{representing}} growers, distributors and marketers of tobacco took legal action, claiming that <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> manipulated {{this study and}} ignored accepted scientific and statistical practices.|$|R
5000|$|President Bush's {{administration}} also attempted to censor results of climate studies, [...] "nearly half of 1,600 government scientists at seven agencies ranging from NASA to <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> been warned against using terms like 'global warming' in reports or speeches, throughout Bush’s eight-year presidency".|$|R
50|$|In 1989, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Public Citizen filed {{a lawsuit}} against <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> (and Administrator of <b>the</b> <b>EPA,</b> William Reilly). <b>The</b> plaintiffs claimed <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> not {{complied}} with the CWA with respect to CAFOs. The lawsuit, Natural Resources Defense Council v. Reilly (D.D.C. 1991), resulted in a court order mandating <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> update its regulations. They did so in what would become the 2003 Final Rule.|$|R
25|$|The national-scale air toxics {{assessment}} (NATA) is {{an evaluation}} of air toxics by the U.S. EPA. <b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> furnished four assessments that characterize nationwide chronic cancer risk estimates and noncancer hazards from inhaling air toxics. The lates was from 2005, and made publicly available in early 2011.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} sections of the act, the specified protections for babies and infants, was the topic of the National Academy of Science's 1993 report, Pesticides in the Diets of Infants & Children. <b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> cited this report as a catalyst for the creation of the FQPA.|$|E
25|$|The Blue Mountains {{ecoregion}} {{has been}} subdivided into fourteen Level IV ecoregions, as described below. <b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> {{not yet published}} an Ecoregions of Washington poster similar to the informational posters for Oregon and Idaho, and the Washington information presented here is not as complete as {{the information about the}} other two states.|$|E

50|$|Pruitt's office sued <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> {{to block}} its Clean Power Plan and Waters of the United States rule. Pruitt also sued <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> {{on behalf of}} Oklahoma {{utilities}} unwilling {{to take on the}} burdens of additional regulation of their coal-fired plants, and criticized the agency in a congressional hearing. As of June 2014, all of Pruitt's lawsuits against <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> failed. By January 2017, Pruitt <b>had</b> sued <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> 13 times.|$|R
5000|$|In 1991 the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals {{found that}} <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> {{improperly}} interpreted <b>the</b> NSR and ruled that work that [...] "does not 'change or alter' the design or {{nature of the}} facility", would render the facility exempt from the NSR rules. Rather, it merely allows the facility to operate again as it had before the specific equipment deteriorated." [...] The appeals court also ruled that WEPCo would not emit any more pollutants after the improvements, and agreed with WEPCo that its emissions would actually decrease and that <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> miscalculated its estimation of the plants emissions. However the court did agree with <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> that <b>the</b> repairs and modifications to the plant did not constitute [...] "routine maintenance" [...] After the WEPCo ruling, <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> continued to take a case by case approach to NSR's at facilities built before 1977, viewing the court's ruling as applying to the power sector specifically and not to all similar NSR applications in general.|$|R
25|$|While <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> {{not found}} {{significant}} {{evidence of a}} widespread, systematic impact on drinking water by hydraulic fracturing, {{this may be due}} to insufficient systematic pre- and post- hydraulic fracturing data on drinking water quality, and the presence of other agents of contamination that preclude the link between shale oil/gas extraction and its impact.|$|E
25|$|The Columbia Plateau {{ecoregion}} {{has been}} subdivided into at least fourteen Level IV ecoregions, as described below. <b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> {{not yet published}} an Ecoregions of Washington poster similar to the informational posters for Oregon and Idaho, and the Washington information presented here is not as complete as {{the information about the}} other two states.|$|E
25|$|Evidence for the {{carcinogenicity}} of 1,3-dichloropropene {{in humans}} is inadequate, but results from several cancer bioassays provide adequate evidence of carcinogenicity in animals. In the US, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) {{has determined that}} 1,3-dichloropropene may reasonably be anticipated to be a carcinogen. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that 1,3-dichloropropene is possibly carcinogenic to humans. <b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> classified 1,3-dichloropropene as a probable human carcinogen.|$|E
5000|$|In {{testimony}} before the Subcommittee on Environment and Economy, <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response stated that <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> complied with <b>the</b> existing three year reporting deadline and expressed a commitment [...] "to working with the states as we evaluate approaches for addressing financial responsibility. <b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> stated that <b>the</b> removal of the 3 year reporting deadline [...] "could potentially reduce a regulatory burden on EPA." ...|$|R
50|$|In December 2013, {{the federal}} Office of the Inspector General, {{addressing}} complaints by six US senators, {{issued a report}} concluding that <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> been justified in issuing its 2010 emergency order, and had acted reasonably in withdrawing the order after Range had agreed to groundwater quality monitoring.|$|R
5000|$|By 1982, <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> {{lost its}} credibility, {{but at the}} same time {{activism}} became more influential, and there was an increase in the funding and memberships of major non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Industry gradually became more cooperative with government and new managerial structures were implemented to achieve compliances with regulations.|$|R
25|$|The live impact range, {{which is}} the most {{contaminated}} zone, was given the highest protected environmental status, that of a “wilderness preserve.” The Fish and Wildlife Service states that Vieques Wildlife Refuge is an ecologically diverse Caribbean wildlife refuge. <b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> declared the refuge a superfund site. Much of the lands are now termed wildlife refuges, meaning that humans are not allowed on the land, therefore allowing the Navy to avoid cleanup. Whether or not the U.S. made the land a wildlife refuge to avoid cleaning up the island is debated.|$|E
25|$|Reclaimed {{water is}} not {{regulated}} by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> developed water reuse guidelines that were most recently updated in 2012. The EPA Guidelines for Water Reuse represents the international standard for best practices in water reuse. The document was developed under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the global consultancy CDM Smith. The Guidelines {{provide a framework for}} states to develop regulations that incorporate the best practices and address local requirements.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> its {{headquarters}} in Washington, D.C., regional offices {{for each of the}} agency's ten regions, and 27 laboratories. The agency conducts environmental assessment, research, and education. It has the responsibility of maintaining and enforcing national standards under a variety of environmental laws, in consultation with state, tribal, and local governments. It delegates some permitting, monitoring, and enforcement responsibility to U.S. states and the federally recognized tribes. EPA enforcement powers include fines, sanctions, and other measures. The agency also works with industries and all levels of government {{in a wide variety of}} voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts.|$|E

50|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer and <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>have</b> {{classified}} <b>the</b> compound as {{a possible}} human carcinogen. Animals exposed to Heptachlor epoxide during gestation and infancy are found to have changes in nervous system and immune function. Higher doses of Heptachlor when exposed to newborn animals caused decrease in body weight and death.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> {{established}} {{guidance for}} assessing the cumulative risk for multiroute exposures to pesticide groups determined to have a common mechanism of toxicity. The Agency has also published guidance on determining whether chemicals share a common mechanism of toxicity, i.e., whether they can be assessed as a common mechanism group. The risk calculation is based on dose addition, where individual pesticide exposure levels are scaled by their relative potency and then summed. Some key uncertainties in this approach include the possibility that relative potency changes with dose, {{and the potential for}} toxicological interactions (dose addition assumes no toxicological interactions). Another caution is that the resulting risk assessments are not complete environmental health evaluations of all chemical exposures, but only represent risks from those common mechanism pesticides.|$|E
25|$|While {{monitoring}} and controlling environmental releases of plants has been difficult, <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> been enforcing their policies regarding air quality {{over the last}} decade under President Barack Obama. While the Clean Air Act postulates regulations and rules limiting the emissions of greenhouse gases, other laws are concerned with standards of power plants and initiatives to enforce these laws have been formed. The impacts of mining are diverse and have possible negative effects for humans and the biosphere. Among these are acid mine drainage, subsidence and mine workers' health risks, to prevent which there are regulations regarding mining practices like strip mining. Even though regulations seek to address environmental impacts, they often do not provide remedy for the social and health disparities created by exposure to emissions from electric power plants.|$|E
25|$|Overall, the Program's cap {{and trade}} program has been hailed as {{successful}} by the EPA, industry, economists and certain environmental {{groups such as the}} Environmental Defense Fund, while skeptical environmentalists have argued that reduction in emissions occurred due to broad trends unconnected to the program. <b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> used what is called the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) to estimate the effect of the Acid Rain Program (ARP). The output from the model says that annual emissions of sulfur dioxide were reduced by 8 million tons (from 17.3 to 9.3), nitrogen oxides by 2.7 million tons (from 7.6 to 5), and mercury by 10 tons (from 52 to 42). However, it is difficult to estimate the emissions which would have occurred without the ARP. For example, the EPA updated its analysis to reflect the effect of low-sulfur coal becoming more economical due to reduced transportation, leading the EPA to reduce its estimate of the impact of ARP by sulfur dioxide emissions by one million tons.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, state {{regulators}} {{from across the}} country stated that they had seen no evidence of hydraulic fracturing contaminating water in their respective jurisdictions. [...] In May 2011 <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> Administrator Lisa P. Jackson testified in a Senate Hearing Committee stating that <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> never made a definitive determination of contamination where the hydraulic fracturing process itself has contaminated water. [...] However, by 2013, Dr. Robin Ikeda, Deputy Director of Noncommunicable Diseases, Injury and Environmental Health at the CDC testified to congress that <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> documented contamination at several sites.|$|R
50|$|Before 2017, <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>have</b> {{spent more}} than $8.7 million on {{environmental}} education annually to increase public knowledge and awareness about the current environmental issues and the consequences.
