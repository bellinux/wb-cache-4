2500|$|The S.Tu.R.P. group {{initially}} {{planned to}} conduct a range of different studies on the cloth, including radio-carbon dating. A commission headed by chemist Robert H. Dinegar and physicist Harry E. Gove consulted numerous laboratories which were able at the time (1982) <b>to</b> <b>carbon-date</b> small fabric samples. The six labs that showed interest in performing the procedure fell into two categories, according to the method they utilised: ...|$|E
50|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} at Cramond {{have uncovered}} evidence of habitation dating to around 8500 BC, making it, for a time, {{the earliest known}} site of human settlement in Scotland. The inhabitants of the Mesolithic camp-site were nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved around their territories according to the season of the year. Although no bones survived the acid soil, waste pits and stakeholes that would have supported shelters or windbreaks were excavated. Numerous discarded hazelnut shells, the waste product of the inhabitants' staple food, {{were found in the}} pits and used <b>to</b> <b>carbon-date</b> the site. It is thought the site was chosen for its location near the junction of the Firth of Forth and the River Almond, where the rich oyster and mussel beds proved a reliable natural resource. Many microlith stone tools manufactured at the site were found, and pre-date finds of similar style in England.|$|E
50|$|Although written {{history of}} the region begins with the Sioux {{domination}} of the land over the native Arikara tribes, researchers have carbon-dating and stratigraphic records to analyze the early {{history of the}} area. Scientists have been able <b>to</b> utilize <b>carbon-dating</b> <b>to</b> evaluate the age of tools found in the area, which indicate a human presence that dates as far back as 11,500 BCE with the Clovis culture. Stratigraphic records indicate environmental changes in the land, such as flood and drought patterns. For example, large-scale flooding of the Black Hill basins occurs at a probability rate of 0.01, making such floods occur once in every 100 years. However, during The Medieval Climate Anomaly, or the Medieval Warm Period, flooding increased in the basins. A stratigraphic record of the area shows that during this 400-year period, thirteen 100-year floods occurred in four of the region's basins, while the same four basins from the previous 800 years only experienced nine floods.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the stones}} {{have not been}} {{submitted}} <b>to</b> dating techniques, <b>carbon-dating</b> of pottery sherds has placed the site at 500 - 2000 years old. The origin of these granite blocks {{has yet to be}} studied as well. In certain Megalithic sites, such as Stonehenge in Wiltshire, England, the blocks were moved to the site from some distance away. Archaeologists are not yet sure whether the Rego Grande site were also brought from elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|The {{date of the}} Avellino {{eruption}} {{remains to}} be determined with a precision greater than about 500 years {{within the framework of}} the Early/Middle Bronze Age. A range of 2000-1500 BC includes the great majority of estimates. Ample opportunity to obtain Carbon-14 dates from charcoal and soil buried under the deposits has existed and still exists. Sporadic radiocarbon dating continues, with each scientist claiming to have obtained [...] "the latest". Consistency with previous and subsequent work remains elusive. Since a real and very precise calendar date of the eruption must have existed, variation in estimations can only be the result of limitations <b>to</b> the <b>carbon-dating</b> method, which, given a plenitude of reliably emplaced samples, can only produce a date within a window of roughly 500 years in a maximum elapsed time of roughly 4000 years or [...] (12.5%).|$|R
500|$|To date, the {{earliest}} Mother Goddess figurine unearthed in India (near Allahabad) {{belongs to the}} Upper Paleolithic, and <b>carbon-dates</b> <b>to</b> approximately 20,000 - 23,000 BCE. Also belonging to that period are some collections of colorful stones marked with natural triangles. Discovered near Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh, they are similar to stones still worshiped as Devi by tribal groups in the area. Moreover, they [...] "may demonstrate connections to the later Tantric use of yantras, in which triangles manifest a vital symbolism connected with fertility." ...|$|R
5000|$|AFP {{reported}} in the New Straits Times that Olsson excavated at Murree under archaeologist Ahmad Hassan Dani's supervision, {{and that she had}} suggested testing DNA from there and from Roza Bal, along with <b>carbon-dating,</b> <b>to</b> establish a connection between the two sites. In 2002, Olsson wrote to the custodians of the Roza Bal shrine using personal claims of descendance from Jesus, whom she referred to as [...] "our grandfather", to request access to the shrine's graves under Islamic law, referring them to the book Bloodline of the Holy Grail by Laurence Gardner. Olsson also wrote that she was prepared to go to court to exhume the remains, which she wanted to remove from Srinagar.|$|R
40|$|The {{location}} for this thesis {{has been the}} river Sagbekken. Sagbekken is a small river in Foldal municipality in Hedmark county in Norway, and it ends it’s journey in lake Butjønna. The river is not directly connected to Glomma, but {{through a couple of}} other streams the water from lake Butjønna meets Glomma in Alvdal. This thesis describes a paleohydrological study of lacustrine sediments. The idea behind this project was to determine wether the conservation-potential of Sagbekken’s flood-signals in lake Butjønna was of good enough quality to make a reconstruction of Sagbekken’s flood-history. Two sediment-cores each 5 m long were taken from the bottom of lake Butjønna. The making of a visual log and loss-on-ignition analysis showed a clear lamination between the mineral flood-signals and the organic matter. Floods of a certain magnitude deposit enough mineral material to create a horizontal layer in the cores. The magnitude of the flood determine how thick the layer is. Altogether 68 flood-layers was recorded from Storofsen in AD 1789 <b>to</b> 9500 BP. <b>Carbon-dating</b> methods was used to determine the age. With such a long time-span it’s easy to see how the flood-regimes have changed from periods with frequent floods to periods without floods at all. A recurrence-interval was estimated for Sagbekken and it was found to be 137 years. This estimation rests on the assumption that a constant sedimentation has taken place in lake Butjønna. The floods have duration from a few hours to a couple of days, and are therefore kept out. The maximum grain-size, the competence, Sagbekken could carry during the spring-flood was estimated with indirectly methods. Observation of flood-marks along the river channel was the basis for a reconstruction of the water surface. With the use of Manning’s formula was the speed, discharge and competence estimated for the spring flood in Sagbekken. The competence was estimated to 4 mm +/- 1 mm, and that fits well with the observations of sand along the river-channel...|$|R
