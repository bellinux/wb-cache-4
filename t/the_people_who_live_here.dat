Perhaps the people who worked the mine built the marble huts. The world is old, and no doubt plenty of people have lived in it and been forgotten."[*] ...|$|E

50|$|Patalkot, in the hilly block 'Tamia' of Chhindwara District, has {{acquired}} great importance {{because of its}} geographical and scenic beauty. Patalkot is a lovely landscape located {{at a depth of}} 1200-1500 feet in a valley. Because of the great depth, this place is christened as 'Patalkot' (patal menas very deep, in Sanskrit). When one looks down {{from the top of the}} valley, the place looks like a horseshoe in shape. Earlier, people believed it as the entrance to 'Patal'. There is one more belief that after worshiping 'Lord Shiva' Prince Meghnath had gone to Patal-lok through this place only. People say that this place was ruled by kings in 18th and 19th centuries and that there was a long tunnel connecting this place to 'Pachmarhi' in Hoshangabad District. Because of the inaccessibility of this area, the tribals of this region were totally cut off from the civilized world. But, with the constant efforts being made by the government, tribals of this area started tasting the advantages of adopting civilized life. 'Patalkot' is attracting many tourists because of its geographical location, scenic beauty, culture of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>here,</b> and the immense and rare herbal wealth.|$|E

The bar is a window into a self-contained mountain colony, a tavern-as-nexus where information is traded in a phoneless society.|$|E
