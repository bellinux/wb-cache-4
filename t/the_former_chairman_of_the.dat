5|$|The Constitution {{introduces}} {{separation of}} powers. According to Belarusian law, each office is separate but {{must work together}} to serve the people. The Constitution also makes Belarus a presidential democracy, significantly reducing {{the role of the}} prime minister. Of the fifteen former Soviet republics, Belarus was the one of latest to create and pass a new constitution subsequent to the dissolution of the USSR. A delay occurred due to debates among Supreme Soviet deputies, who were also trying to stave off the opposition and democratic forces who wanted to close the Supreme Soviet down for good. A power struggle to determine the relationship between the new executive branch and the legislature caused much of the debate in 1992 and 1993. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Soviet, Stanislau Shushkevich, criticized the early drafts due to the amount of power granted to the president. The opposition Belarusian Popular Front criticized the final drafts {{due to the lack of}} balance between the two parties and for allowing Vyachaslau Kebich to run for presidential elections in June of that year despite serving in the same role with the SSR.|$|E
