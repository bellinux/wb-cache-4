5000|$|In {{the middle}} of the 1999 model year, {{vehicles}} with the 4.0 L engine received a revised intake manifold. This was done to help counteract smaller exhaust porting on the latest casting of cylinder heads, which was done to meet more stringent emissions control laws. Both the four- and six-cylinder engines were offered through the 2000 model year, though only the straight-six was available in 2001. For the 2000 and 2001 model years, all six-cylinder XJs received a distributorless ignition system using coil-on-plug ignition replacing the [...] "traditional" [...] system previously used; coupled with better exhaust porting and the newer intake manifolds, this gave a minor increase in power over the previous models. <b>Transmission,</b> <b>axle,</b> and transfer case choices were carried over from the previous models.|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to present}} the {{application}} of the finite element method to perform stress and fatigue analysis on a mechanical drive axle. Drive axles are widely used in rotating machinery and are subject to fatigue problems. The rotary <b>transmission</b> <b>axle</b> in this study is supported in bearings loaded by an alternating force of 6. 8 kN, wherein the axle has rounding radii all 0. 003 m in size and a ground surface of AISI 1050 steel with Young’s elasticity modulus of 206. 8 GPa and Poisson modulus of 0. 28. We present the rupture conditions ensuing from tension as well as fatigue, for a lifetime of the <b>transmission</b> <b>axle</b> of 350, 000 cycles. The quantitative results compared satisfactorily to the empirical fatigue data...|$|E

5000|$|From 1958, {{the factory}} started to produce RAF-977 minibuses, based on GAZ-21 Volga engine (between the front seats, {{rather like the}} Dodge A100; the engine was {{accessible}} through an inside hatch), <b>transmission,</b> <b>axles,</b> and steering. It was planned to produce passenger ("route taxis" [...] for airports, and for sporting teams), freight, mail, and ambulance versions of the vehicle, to replace the modified estates then in use. Drawing inspiration from the VW Type 2, it had a front-mounted water-cooled [...] engine (based on the Volga's, with a lower compression ratio), and seated ten.

25|$|In 1980, the 2.25-litre petrol {{and diesel}} engines {{received}} five main bearing crankshafts to increase rigidity and the <b>transmission,</b> <b>axles</b> and wheel hubs were strengthened. This {{was the culmination of}} a series of updates to the transmission that had been made since the 1960s to combat the all-too-common problem of the rear axle half-shafts breaking in heavy usage. This problem was partly due to the design of the shafts themselves. Due to the fully floating design of the rear wheel hubs, the half shafts can be removed very quickly without even having to jack the vehicle off the ground. The tendency for commercial operators to overload their vehicles exacerbated this flaw which blighted the Series Land Rovers in many of their export markets and established a reputation that continues in many markets to the present day. This is despite the 1982 re-design (mainly the increase of driving-splines from 10 to 24 to reduce stress) that all but solved the problem.|$|R
50|$|Electric retarders use {{electromagnetic}} induction {{to provide a}} retardation force. An electric retardation unit can be placed on an <b>axle,</b> <b>transmission,</b> or driveline and consists of a rotor attached to the <b>axle,</b> <b>transmission,</b> or driveline—and a stator securely attached to the vehicle chassis. There are no contact surfaces between the rotor and stator, and no working fluid. When retardation is required, the electrical windings in the stator receive power from the vehicle battery, producing a magnetic field through which the rotor moves. This induces eddy currents in the rotor, which produces an opposing magnetic field to the stator. The opposing magnetic fields slows the rotor, and hence the <b>axle,</b> <b>transmission</b> or driveshaft {{to which it is}} attached. The rotor incorporates internal vanes (like a ventilated brake disk) to provide its own air cooling, so no load is placed on the vehicle's engine cooling system. The operation of the system is extremely quiet.|$|R
