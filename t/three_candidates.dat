5|$|As Wilkinson's term ended, he {{appointed}} {{himself to a}} six-year term on the University of Kentucky's board of regents. The move was unprecedented, and was particularly controversial because of Wilkinson's open feuds with Charles T. Wethington, Jr., the university president. An incensed legislature passed a law shortly thereafter that dissolved the existing boards of trustees at all Kentucky public colleges and universities and mandated that they be reconstituted by allowing the governor to select each member {{from a list of}} <b>three</b> <b>candidates</b> recommended by an independent review board. Jones, who succeeded Wilkinson as governor, used the provisions of the law to remove Wilkinson and several of his appointees from the university boards.|$|E

In the fourth and final stage of the redistribution of votes after <b>three</b> <b>candidates</b> had been eliminated, Ed Miliband led in the trade unions and affiliated organisations section of the electoral college (19.93% of the total to David's 13.40%), but in both the MPs and MEPs section (15.52% to 17.81%), and Constituency Labour Party section (15.20% to 18.14%), came second.

5|$|Entering the Democratic nominating convention, Brown {{seemed to}} be the {{favorite}} for the nomination. On the first ballot, he garnered the most votes (275), leading Clay (264), Clardy (190), and Hardin (186). Over the next nine ballots, the vote counts changed little. Finally, the convention chairman announced that the candidate receiving the fewest votes on the next ballot would be dropped from the voting. Clardy received the fewest votes, and on the next ballot, his supporters divided almost equally between the remaining <b>three</b> <b>candidates.</b> Hardin was the next candidate to be dropped, and Brown received a majority over Clay on the thirteenth ballot.|$|E

A month later, {{he said he}} was not interested in Yale, but that he might move to an unnamed Eastern school with little football tradition. Shaughnessy resigned in March 1942 to move to Maryland. A 1977 Sports Illustrated article reported that he decided to leave when he realized Stanford might discontinue its football program during World War II. He expressed disappointment about leaving, but believed the new job would provide a challenge. Maryland reportedly offered the same salary as Stanford, $9,000 ($ adjusted for inflation), and a position on its faculty.|$|E

5|$|In February 2012 the Standards in Public Office Commission {{published}} the candidates' returns for campaign donations and election expenses.

Only donations above €638 need be reported, making the reported totals less meaningful. Gay Mitchell had stated his campaign would be funded by a Fine Gael members' lottery.|$|E

5|$|On September 5, 2008, Harper {{nominated}} Thomas Cromwell of Nova Scotia Court of Appeal to {{fill the}} Supreme Court seat left vacant by the departure of Michel Bastarache. By and large Cromwell's nomination was well received, with many lauding the selection; however, dissent has been noted surrounding the nomination. First, Harper bypassed parliament's supreme court selection panel, {{which was supposed to}} produce a list of <b>three</b> <b>candidates</b> for him to choose from. Second, Newfoundland justice minister Jerome Kennedy criticized the appointment, citing the Newfoundland government's belief that constitutional convention stipulates that a Newfoundlander should have been named to the court in the rotation of Atlantic Canadian supreme court representation.|$|E

40|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} (HGT) {{has long been}} considered as a principal force for an organism to gain novel genes in genome evolution. Homology search, phylogenetic analysis and nucleotide composition analysis are three major objective approaches to arguably determine the occurrence and directionality of HGT. Here, 21 genes that possess the potential to horizontal transfer were acquired from the whole genome of Magnaporthe grisea according to annotation, among which <b>three</b> <b>candidate</b> genes (corresponding protein accession numbers are EAA 55123, EAA 47200 and EAA 52136) were selected for further analysis. According to BLAST homology results, we subsequently conducted phylogenetic analysis of the <b>three</b> <b>candidate</b> HGT genes. Moreover, nucleotide composition analysis was conducted to further validate these HGTs. In addition, {{the functions of the}} <b>three</b> <b>candidate</b> genes were searched in COG database. Consequently, we conclude that the gene encoding protein EAA 55123 is transferred from Clostridium perfringens. Another HGT event is between EAA 52136 and a certain metazoan’s corresponding gene, but the direction remains uncertain. Yet, EAA 47200 is not a transferred gene...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{divergence}} of mitochondrial DNA {{does not}} necessarily correspond to reproductive isolation. However, if mitochondrial DNA lineages occupy separate segments of environmental space, this supports the notion of their evolutionary independence. We explore niche differentiation among <b>three</b> <b>candidate</b> species of crested newt (characterized by distinct mitochondrial DNA lineages) and interpret the results {{in the light of}} differences observed for recognized crested newt species. We quantify niche differences among all crested newt (candidate) species and test hypotheses regarding niche evolution, employing two ordination techniques (PCA-env and ENFA). Niche equivalency is rejected: all (candidate) species are found to occupy significantly different segments of environmental space. Furthermore, niche overlap values for the <b>three</b> <b>candidate</b> species are not significantly higher than those for the recognized species. As the <b>three</b> <b>candidate</b> crested newt species are, {{not only in terms of}} mitochondrial DNA genetic divergence, but also ecologically speaking, as diverged as the recognized crested newt species, our findings are in line with the hypothesis that they represent cryptic species. We address potential pitfalls of our methodology...|$|R
5|$|The {{governor}} {{also can}} influence the state court system through the appointment of judges. In Indiana, when vacancies occur on the Supreme Court, Tax Court, and circuit courts, the Judicial Nominating Commission interviews candidates and sends a list of <b>three</b> <b>candidates</b> for each vacancy to the governor, who chooses one. Justices of the peace and superior courts judges are elected in Indiana; if a vacancy occurs (such as by death or resignation) the governor may make an appointment, who holds the office until the next general election. The authority to make such appointments gives the governor considerable sway in setting {{the makeup of the}} judiciary.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Endara and {{his running}} mates, Ricardo Arias Calderón and Guillermo Ford, led a {{contingent}} of a thousand supporters to protest the annulment of the elections and urge that the ADOC candidates be recognized as the winners. The protest was attacked by a detachment of Dignity Battalions, a paramilitary group supporting Noriega, and the <b>three</b> <b>candidates</b> were badly beaten. Endara was struck with an iron club, leaving a gash on his head. He was briefly hospitalized and received eight stitches. Images of the attacks on Endara and Ford were carried by media around the world, and were credited with building public support in the US for the invasion that would soon follow.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin was {{translated}} from the see of Worcester to the see of Canterbury in December 1184, after Henry II {{let it be known}} that he would accept only Baldwin at Canterbury; the previous incumbent, Richard of Dover, had died in April that year. The monks put forward <b>three</b> <b>candidates</b> from within Christ Church Priory: Odo, who had been prior of Christ Church and was then Abbot of Battle Abbey, Peter de Leia, a Cluniac prior of Wenlock Priory and later Bishop of St David's, and Theobald, Abbot of Cluny, but none of them found favour with the English bishops. Instead, the prelates selected the king's choice, Baldwin. The selection of Baldwin took place only after a dispute between the members of the cathedral chapter of Canterbury and the suffragan bishops of Canterbury, both of whom claimed the right to elect the new archbishop.|$|E
