500|$|In 2008, Corey Taylor {{commented on}} a {{slashing}} incident at a South African school to which Slipknot was linked; he said: ...obviously, I'm {{disturbed by the}} fact that people were hurt and someone died, as far as my responsibility for that goes, it stops <b>there,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> know our message is actually very positive...there {{are always going to be}} mental disorders and people who cause violence for no other reason than the fact that they're fucked up and lost.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] was {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas and co-directed by Knowles for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was released the same month. It was the first video of the eight videos shot in two weeks for the album. The music video for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] is only one-minute long and it serves as the introduction for the music video of [...] "Green Light". On the other hand, Matsoukas said that the half-day shoot for [...] "Kitty Kat", by comparison, [...] "was a breeze." [...] Elaborating on the conception of the video, Knowles said: [...] "We had the oversized kitty cat , which was so cute! I had to pretend it was <b>there,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was really {{in front of the}} green screen — I'd be on a big giant wooden cow and they superimposed a kitten. And we used leopard-print makeup and the catsuit and the nails to make me more like a cat. I really am a cat person".|$|E
2500|$|Astaire's {{life has}} never been portrayed on film. [...] He always refused {{permission}} for such portrayals, saying, [...] "However much they offer me—and offers come in all the time—I shall not sell." [...] Astaire's will included a clause requesting that no such portrayal ever take place; he commented, [...] "It is <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have no particular desire to have my life misinterpreted, which it would be." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Talk magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger {{was asked if he}} thought of running for office. He replied, [...] "I think about it many times. The possibility is <b>there,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> feel it inside." [...] The Hollywood Reporter claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for governor of California. Following his initial comments, Schwarzenegger said, [...] "I'm in show business– I am {{in the middle of my}} career. Why would I go away from that and jump into something else?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Botham {{also had}} a holiday home nearby in Alderney and during {{the last seven years}} of Arlott's life they often had two meals a day {{together}} when he was staying on the island. [...] "At six minutes past nine every morning the phone would ring. John would say, 'C'mon over — and bring your thirst with you.' At the end when the emphysema took over and he was struggling with speech he had an oxygen mask and I often had to empty his bag for him. But he liked me being <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> knew to wait and let him finish his sentences between gasps. I didn't try to say the words for him because I knew how much they mattered. That was strange for me – to be patient and quiet. But I always wanted to listen to John." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blackman {{is adamant}} that musicality {{has nothing to}} do with gender. [...] "The gender {{question}} is not even worth bringing up because the drums have got nothing to do with gender", Blackman says. [...] "I'm <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> love to play music. And I'm in support of anyone who wants to play the instrument. I wouldn't care if Art Blakey was pink with polka dots and wearing a tutu. I wouldn't care if Tony Williams was green." [...] "There are people who have opinions about whatever and whoever, in terms of gender, in terms of race and weight, hairstyle, religion", says Blackman. [...] "But to me, your personality influences what you play and what you do, but everything else is for you to develop and to nourish and to take further, and that's where I'm at. In terms of my goals, me being a female drummer has nothing to with anything except for the fact that I wear bras and panties and guys don't." ...|$|E

5000|$|In an interview, {{the series}} creator Peter Molyneux, said that [...] "Populous was {{like it was}} due to my {{incompetence}} as a games programmer ... the reason the feature (raise the land) was <b>there</b> was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> couldn't get the little people to navigate around the coast".|$|R
2500|$|Douglas Yancey [...] "Doug" [...] Funnie (Billy West in the Nickelodeon series; Tom McHugh in the Disney series): Doug is {{depicted}} as an introverted, quiet, insecure, and naive 11(later 12)-year-old boy who {{more often than not}} tries to deal with his fears of failure and of social rejection. He has talents for writing, drawing, making music (he plays a banjo), and caring for animals (he owns a dog named Porkchop). While Doug just wants to fit in with his peers, he possesses quite an imagination and a strong sense of morality that both make him stand out amongs them. Doug narrates every episode, and writes his experiences in his journal. His alter ego, Quailman, was inspired by Jinkins' and Roberts' home movies as children, posing as superheroes. Billy West, the original voice behind Doug, was assigned by executive Vanessa Coffey, to Jinkins' initial reluctance. Despite this, he would come to view it as the best possible voice for the character. West, in recording lines for Doug, noted that [...] "There's a lot of me in there, because I'm going through my own experiences in <b>there,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have a conscience." ...|$|E

5000|$|... (63) King Darius says: On {{this account}} Ahuramazda brought me help, {{and all the}} other gods, all that <b>there</b> are, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was not wicked, nor was I a liar, nor was I a despot, neither I nor any of my family. I have ruled {{according}} to righteousness. Neither to the weak nor to the powerful did I do wrong. Whosoever helped my house, him I favored; he who was hostile, him I destroyed.|$|R

5000|$|Stein {{finally asked}} my opinion on people being fired for {{endorsing}} Intelligent Design. I replied that I {{know of no}} instance where such a firing has happened. This seemingly innocent observation {{was turned into a}} filmic confession of ignorance when my on-camera interview abruptly ends <b>there,</b> <b>because</b> when <b>I</b> saw Expelled at a preview screening... I discovered that the central thesis of the film is a conspiracy theory about the systematic attempt to keep Intelligent Design creationism out of American classrooms and culture.|$|R
5000|$|In the June 2013 {{issue of}} Gay Times, Moyet {{revealed}} other considered titles: [...] "Changeling" [...] ("but Toyah had an album called Changeling"). [...] "'Alison Moyet And The Man From,' ...<b>because</b> <b>I</b> wanted Guy in <b>there</b> somewhere. <b>Because</b> like <b>I</b> say this {{felt like a}} band album to me {{as opposed to a}} solo singer album.

6000|$|... "I {{spent nearly}} all night sitting under a little hemlock tree with {{branches}} {{very close to}} the ground. I sat <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't dare do anything else.

Now I am cast out, {{and there is no}} more life for me <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is no more love, and there is no more love because, having felt his, no other can come after. Here have I sat with all the tortures of Hell burning in my blood <b>because</b> <b>I</b> knew that you and he were <b>there</b> alone, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was never sure that, after all, I was not doing my lord's will. And now I know that I {{suffered}} in vain. You did not understand." ...|$|R

[...] Collinet continued, translating from his interview in French with Bopol for the program, [...] "Bopol says, if there were good studios in Zaire I would prefer to work <b>there,</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> have lots of inspiration -- you can see what people are doing.
