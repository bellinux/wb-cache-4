40|$|This paper {{theoretically}} and empirically {{analyzes the}} sources of the observed pattern that the levels and growth rates of technology are different across countries. The model is extended version of endogenous growth models with catching up model which is formulated by the relative backwardness hypothesis and the adoption capacity. The relative backwardness hypothesis states that the backward countries attain a high productivity growth rate because adopting advanced technologies is easier and less costly than innovation, Thus, the technologically less advanced countries tend to grow faster than technologically leading countries. A necessary condition, in order that the laggard countries might be {{able to take advantage of}} the available technology, is the well-developed capacity, ``Adoption capacity'', to adopt the superior technology. This is determined by policy variables that are conducive to technology adoption. The catching up theory states that <b>technological</b> <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> is strongest in countries that are not only technologically backward but also in those countries which have policy determinants conducive to technology adoption. Theoretically, it is shown that the steady state growth rate of technology is determined by population growth rate while the steady state relative backwardness depends on the adoption capacity, the productivity in the R&D sector, and the relative human capital stock. The empirical relevance of the catching up theory is investigated as well. The empirical results support the formalized catching up theory by showing the significant role which policy determinants conducive to technological adoption play. The robust role of scale effects in explaining <b>technological</b> <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> is also shown. Further, the speeds of <b>technological</b> <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> are estimated to be around 2 percent. ...|$|E

Main focuses of studies on NIS in developing countries were on countries that have intensive technological learning and, hence, successfully catching up with developed countries. This paper, using Thailand as a case study, aims at understanding the NIS in developing countries that are less successful in <b>technological</b> <b>catching</b> <b>up.</b> It proposes that, as opposed to developed countries and NIEs, the development level of NIS in Thailand does not link to its economic structural development level. As she has experienced structural changes from agriculture-dominated economy to an economy predominantly oriented on the industrial sector, its NIS remains weak and fragmented. The mismatch between the economic structural development and the development of NIS affected the competitiveness of the nation and partially contributed to economic crisis started in 1997. The paper argues that studies of NIS in countries less successful in <b>technological</b> <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> like Thailand should focus not only on how innovation related activities start and improve over time, but also and more importantly, on factors contributing to the long-running perpetuation of weak and fragmented NIS, especially those preventing intensive technological learning to take place.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this study}} we test whether <b>catching</b> <b>up,</b> the hypoth-esis that there is {{technological}} spillover from leaders to follow-ers, is still important among industrialized countries. Since the U.

A testable model is developed and a number of tests for the existence of <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> are performed. A major improvement on previous tests is that the level of technology is measured in terms of total factor productivity. The two major conclusions, which are quite robust, are that after 1970 there is no <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> effect left in the tradables sector, while <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> is found for industries in the nontradables sector...|$|R

Thailand's IPR system appeared to give opportunities for technological diffusion from advanced countries and ‘learning by imitating ’ during the period of ‘weak ’ regime; most firms, however, failed to move from ‘duplicative imitation ’ to ‘creative imitation ’ and innovation. This study explain why this happened by illustrating some missing elements of catching-up IPR regime in Thailand, beyond laws and regulation, such as firms ’ absorptive capacity, the relevant mechanisms of knowledge creation, diffusion and utilization; and innovative enhancing environment.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the trends in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows {{worldwide}} across sectors and across value-chain activities, {{with a particular}} focus on low- and middle-income countries in comparison with advanced countries. We begin by discussing the growing fragmentation of global production and the opportunities this presents to today's developing countries for benefiting from FDI. Our {{review of the literature}} on knowledge spillovers via FDI indicates that spillovers typically occur along the value chain, from foreign firms to their local suppliers or clients but not to their competitors, and that tapping into the technological resources of foreign firms is not an automatic process but hinges on a few host-economy characteristics. Our analysis of worldwide FDI flows during 2008 - 2013 indicates the growing importance of countries outside the traditional industrialised world, accounting for nearly half of inward greenfield FDI projects. While FDI flows into industrialised economies and emerging industrial economies take place mainly in high- or medium-tech manufacturing, other developing countries and least developed countries tend to attract FDI in medium- and low-tech manufacturing. When we examine FDI flows across value-chain activities, we find that emerging economies are attracting increasingly more knowledge-based FDI, with China and India hosting the highest number of FDI projects in innovation activities. Finally, our analysis suggests that - especially in the manufacturing sector - Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) tend to invest more in countries where domestic technological efforts are higher, pointing to the importance of indigenous technological capacities in attracting FDI in the first place, but also in ensuring that these investments generate knowledge spillovers that are crucial for <b>technological</b> <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> by developing countries...|$|E
