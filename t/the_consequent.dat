40|$|The {{structure}} of the optimization procedure may affect the control quality of nonlinear model predictive control (MPC). In this paper, a data-driven optimization framework for nonlinear MPC is proposed, where the linguistic model is employed as the prediction model. The linguistic model consists {{of a series of}} fuzzy rules, whose antecedents are the membership functions of the input variables and <b>the</b> <b>consequents</b> are <b>the</b> predicted output represented by linear combinations of the input variables. The linear properties of <b>the</b> <b>consequents</b> lead to a quadratic optimization framework without online linearisation, which has analytical solution in the calculation of control sequence. Both the parameters in the antecedents and <b>the</b> <b>consequents</b> are calculated by a hybrid-learning algorithm based on plant data, and the data-driven determination of the parameters leads to an optimization framework with optimized controller parameters, which could provide higher control accuracy. Experiments are conducted in the process control of biochemical continuous sterilization, and the performance of the proposed method is compared with those of the methods of MPC based on linear model, the nonlinear MPC with neural network approximator, and MPC nonlinear with successive linearisations. The experimental results verify that the proposed framework could achieve higher control accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{sketch a}} logic-based {{framework}} in which computation consists of performing actions to generate a sequence of states, {{with the purpose of}} making a set of reactive rules in the logical form antecedents � <b>consequents</b> all true. <b>The</b> antecedents of the rules are conjunctions of past or present conditions and events, and <b>the</b> <b>consequents</b> of <b>the</b> rules are disjunctions of conjunctions of future conditions and actions. The antecedents can be viewed as complex/composite events, and <b>the</b> <b>consequents</b> as complex/composite/macro actions or processes. States are represented by sets of atomic sentences, and can be viewed as global variables, relational databases, Herbrand models, or mental representations of the real world. Events, including actions, transform one state into another. The operational semantics maintains only a single, destructively updated current state, whereas the model-theoretic semantics treats the entire sequence of states, events and actions as a single model. The model-theoretic semantics can be viewed as the problem of generating a model that makes all the reactive rules true...|$|R

At a transition {{of a family of}} periodic orbits from stability to complex instability (also known as Hamiltonian Hopf Bifurcation) the four eigenvalues of the stable periodic orbits move out of the unit circle. Then the periodic orbits become complex unstable. In this paper we first integrate initial conditions close to the ones of a complex unstable periodic orbit, which is close to the transition point. Then, we plot <b>the</b> <b>consequents</b> of <b>the</b> corresponding orbit in a 4 D surface of section.
