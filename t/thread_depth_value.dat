We propose a technique to obtain the <b>depth</b> <b>value</b> from stereo image pair of a retinal fundus for the 3 -D reconstruction of the ONH. Our technique mainly consists of four steps: (1) cutout of the ONH region from the fundus images, (2) registration of the stereo pair, (3) disparity detection, and (4) depth calculation. For quantitative estimation of the <b>depth</b> <b>value</b> measured by using this method, the <b>depth</b> <b>value</b> was compared with the measurement results determined from the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT), which is a confocal laser-scanning microscope.

Objectives: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of pitch and <b>thread</b> <b>depth</b> of orthodontic miniscrew implants (MSI 2 ̆ 7 s) on stress generation. Methods: Quasi-three dimensional photoelastic models were created with MSI 2 ̆ 7 s embedded and then loaded with 60 and 104 grams respectively and evaluated under a full field reflection polariscope. The control MSI 2 ̆ 7 s (1. 0 mm pitch / 0. 25 mm <b>thread</b> <b>depth)</b> were compared to 3 experimental groups (n= 10) which varied with only one design characteristic: Group 1 (0. 75 mm pitch), Group 2 (1. 25 mm pitch) and Group 3 (0. 40 <b>thread</b> <b>depth).</b> The maximum shear stress (tmax) was calculated at 5 predetermined and standardized points. A two-way ANOVA was conducted to compare the means of tmax followed by a Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s post hoc (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Results: No statistical differences were found for tmax between the control group and each of the 3 experimental groups except at point 4. At point 4, the control group was higher by an average of 5. 05 and 7. 1 MPa for the 60 and 104 gram loads respectively (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). No statistically significant differences were found for points 1, 2, and 5 for the 60 gram load and for points 1, 2, 3, and 5 for the 104 gram load. The mean tmax from highest to lowest was located at points 53 ̆c 13 ̆c 23 ̆c 4 3 ̆c 3 in both the 60 and 104 load steps. The variability in tmax at point 4 may have been due to its proximity to the neutral zone of the present loading conditions. Conclusions: As the orthodontic load was increased, maximum shear stress also increased for each of the four MSI designs used in this study. The results of this study suggest that, within limits, variation of pitch and <b>thread</b> <b>depth</b> of MSI 2 ̆ 7 s may not have a significant influence on the stress generation when loaded for orthodontic purposes.

40|$|Objectives : Implant design {{features}} such as macro- and micro-design may influence overall implant success. Limited information is currently available. Therefore, it {{is the purpose of}} this paper to examine these factors such as thread pitch, thread geometry, helix angle, <b>thread</b> <b>depth</b> and width as well as implant crestal module may affect implant stability. Search Strategy : A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE to identify studies, from simulated laboratory models, animal, to human, related to this topic using the keywords of implant thread, implant macrodesign, thread pitch, thread geometry, helix angle, <b>thread</b> <b>depth,</b> <b>thread</b> width and implant crestal module. Results : The results showed how thread geometry affects the distribution of stress forces around the implant. A decreased thread pitch may positively influence implant stability. Excess helix angles in spite of a faster insertion may jeopardize the ability of implants to sustain axial load. Deeper threads seem to have an important effect on the stabilization in poorer bone quality situations. The addition of threads or microthreads up to the crestal module of an implant might provide a potential positive contribution on bone-to to-implant contact as well as on the preservation of marginal bone; nonetheless this remains to be determined. Conclusions : Appraising the current literature on this subject and combining existing data to verify the presence of any association between the selected characteristics may be critical in the achievement of overall implant success.
