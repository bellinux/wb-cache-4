50|$|Lyons Hill is a {{restored}} village, and former parish with church, {{now part of}} the community of Ardclough in north County Kildare. At a time when canal passenger boats travelled at 3 mi/h km/h Lyons was the nearest overnight stop to Dublin on the Grand Canal. On the hilltop is a <b>trigonometrical</b> <b>point</b> used by Ireland's Ordnance Survey. The name derives from the Irish language name for elm tree, Liamhan.|$|E
50|$|Bardon Hill is a hill, {{and former}} volcano, {{in the civil}} parish of Bardon near Coalville, Leicestershire, England. It's the highest point in Leicestershire and the National Forest, 912 ft above sea level, and is visible for miles around. The hill has two {{distinct}} faces: The east is protected as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI); the west is scarred, and partially removed, by the Bardon Hill Quarry. At its summit is a <b>trigonometrical</b> <b>point,</b> and a radio mast. The second highest hill in Leicestershire is the nearby Beacon Hill.|$|E
5000|$|A {{triangulation}} station, {{also known}} as a triangulation pillar, trigonometrical station, <b>trigonometrical</b> <b>point,</b> trig station, trig beacon, or trig point, and sometimes informally as a trig, is a fixed surveying station, used in geodetic surveying and other surveying projects in its vicinity. The nomenclature varies regionally; they are generally known as trigonometrical or triangulation stations in North America, trig points in the United Kingdom, trig stations or points in Australia and New Zealand, and trig beacons in South Africa; triangulation pillar is the more formal term for the concrete columns found in the UK.|$|E
40|$|The {{result of}} {{revision}} of the primary trigonometrical survey in Tango and the other districts was already published in Vol. VII, part 1 of this Bulletin. The results of the survey which was carried out later {{with respect to the}} secondary <b>trigonometrical</b> <b>points</b> are now given in the Tables and the annexed Plate...|$|R
50|$|The Swinger Hill {{housing estate}} {{is located in}} Phillip but {{separated}} by Hindmarsh and Athllon Drives from {{the main part of}} Phillip. The name Swinger Hill follows the pattern of calling local <b>trigonometrical</b> <b>points</b> after the surveyor who surveyed them, in this case Louis Walter Henry Swinger (1901-1943) who surveyed this area.|$|R
40|$|Some {{results of}} the trigonometrical {{revision}} works carried out in Tango Districts after the recent destructive earthquake have already lieen published in this Bulletin, Vol. IV. Later, in 1928, a more extensive revision was carried out, comprising 18 primary and 7 suppdementary <b>trigonometrical</b> <b>points</b> which were all well preserved since the earlier survey in 1885 - 89. The comparison of the {{results of the}} two surveys gives the deformation of the triangulation net as shown in the Table and Figs...|$|R
5000|$|Christopher Monger, {{a native}} of nearby Taff's Well, wrote the novel The Englishman Who Went up a Hill but Came down a Mountain which {{was made into a}} film in 1995. The {{location}} of the fictional [...] "Ffynnon Garw" [...] above the author's home village, suggests that it is the Garth, however, the story is fictional needed and the mound on which the <b>trigonometrical</b> <b>point</b> stands is a Bronze Age burial mound. The popular film has resulted in a stream of visitors climbing to the summit of Garth Mountain to view the location.|$|E
50|$|Early {{exploration}} of the massif included a visit in 1898 and three visits by Arthur Neve, in 1902, 1904, and 1910. In 1903, Dutch mountaineer Dr. H. Sillem investigated the massif and discovered the high plateau between the peaks; he reached an altitude of 6,400 m (21,000 ft) on Nun. In 1906, noted explorer couple Fanny Bullock Workman and her husband William Hunter Workman, claimed an ascent of Pinnacle Peak. They also toured extensively through the massif and produced a map; however, controversy surrounded the Workmans' claims, and few <b>trigonometrical</b> <b>points</b> were given for the region, so that the map they produced was not usable.|$|R

40|$|This thesis probes the rôle and {{significance}} of Geography and Utopia in Günter Eich's poetry. Throughout his four main volumes of poetry a clear pattern of geographical contraction and expansion becomes apparent. In essence, the very wide and indefinite geographical concepts (such as the world, the wind, the clouds etc.) of his first snail volume 'Gedichte' contracts into the more specific, definite and localized names of individual places throughout Germany in tha first of his major volumes 'Abgelegene Gehöfte'. With the confinement theme of his 'imprisonment poems' the geographical contraction reaches its climax in an 'epicentre' pinpointed {{in a very small}} area around the Rhine. This geographical contraction interestingly closely parallels the poet's own personal 'contraction' (his physical confinement behind barbed wire) and his emotional-spiritual 'contraction' (withdrawal into a state of utter despair). From this generalized brough the geographical pattern moves back into an expansionary phase. From this point onwards (i. e. throughout the last three volumes) one notices a gradual expansion of geographical names to embrace the whole of Germany, then Europe and finally the wider world. However this movement of geographical names is not paralleled in the emotional-spiritual sphere. Instead it is this time counteracted by Eich's gradual withdrawal into his private world, seeking refuge in a self-created 'ivory tower', as symbolized by the 'Steingarten' in "Anlässe und Steingärten". The geographical expansion culminates notably in the ultimate distintegration of geographic names in his later poems, signifying the depth of Eich's apparent total disregard for and disinterest in this imperfect world. Günter Eich delivers a significant message about the nature and meaning of his poetry in a talk entitled "Der Schriftsteller vor der Realität" ("The writer before Reality"). Included in this is the statement (reproduced in the original German on page 1) : "I write poetry to orientate myseif towards the truth. I regard them as <b>trigonometrical</b> <b>points</b> or as buoys which mark the course into an unknown area. " Not only does Eich supply us with such a direct statement of his search for the true Reality (i. e. his 'Utopia' perhaps) but he uses geographical terminology to convey his meaning and - within the selected poems - a geographical 'explorer' theme in his unsuccessful attempt to complete it. Not finding this lasting 'Utopia', his true reality, through a dream-like regression into Nature, he goes in pursuit of it into 'this human world'. As his "trigonometrical points or buoys" he initially shows a preference for small isolated places, again indicating Eich's possible expectation of the nature of "the unknown area" he is relentlessly and almost obsessively seeking. Perhaps predictably, it is neither here nor anywhere else in 'this world' that he is able to find his Utopia, which presumably only death ultimately can reveal to him. 'This world', therefore, localized and pinpointed in terms of geographical places, presents itself more and more as a modern 'locus terribilis' - a reality in ruins, in contrast to the longed-for harmonious and united Utopia. Günter Eich comes closest to his Utopia through an apparent transcendence of the world through natural geographical heights and finally in his (self-created) 'ivory tower' world (symbolized by the very artificial and barren 'Steingarten', which at the same time is a reflection of what the world has become to him). Ironically it took a world-wide search (geographically-speaking) to enable him to come across these Japanese Stonegardens, again re-emphasizing the primary role of Geography and its link with Utopia in his poetry. The developed pattern of geographical names and places thus becomes a symbol of Eich's search for the 'actual Truth' the Utopia, which increasingly reveals itself as a 'U-topos', namely (and significantly) a place which does not exist here on earth. In fact this is startlingly illustrated by the final explicit disintegration of the geographical names he uses. Another inter-related observation is quite fascinating. Graphically represented, the geographical pattern of contraction and expansion can be seen in terms of a 'V'-formation. This structural form appears to symbolize 'the free flight of birds' (which parallels the notion of omniscience behind Eich's 'ornithological motif') and maps out a trigonometrical entity which again stresses the rôle and importance of Geography and its relationship to Utopia in the poetry of this ever-searching explorer-poet...|$|R
