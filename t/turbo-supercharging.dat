5000|$|The Seversky Aircraft Company, {{which in}} 1939 {{changed its name}} to Republic, {{constructed}} a range of private venture, one-off variants of its P-35 design, featuring different powerplants and enhancements, designated AP-2, AP-7, AP-4 (which flew after the AP-7), AP-9, XP-41. The series included a carrier-based version designated the NF-1 (Naval Fighter 1) that was also built. The most significant of these was the AP-4, which served as the basis for future Seversky/Republic aircraft. It featured fully retractable landing gear, flush riveting, and, most significantly, a Pratt & Whitney R-1830-SC2G engine with a belly-mounted <b>turbo-supercharger,</b> producing [...] and good high-altitude performance. The <b>turbo-supercharger</b> had been refined by Boeing as part of the development program for the B-17 Flying Fortress, and the improved performance it offered was of great interest to other aircraft manufacturers.|$|R

50|$|Because {{the engine}} is 2-stroke, opposed-piston, the engine {{features}} no heads or valves. The two camshafts on the engine provide timing for two injection pumps per cylinder.

The aircraft flew in April 1937, reaching [...] at [...] Although the <b>turbo-supercharger</b> was extremely unreliable and visibility from the cockpit on takeoff and landing was virtually nonexistent, the USAAC was sufficiently intrigued by the promised performance to order 13 service test YP-37s. Featuring improved aerodynamics and a more reliable <b>turbo-supercharger,</b> the aircraft first flew in June 1939. However, the powerplant remained unreliable and the project was cancelled in favor of another Curtiss design, the P-40.|$|R
25|$|On {{its first}} flight early in 1923, the Rateau <b>turbo-supercharger</b> was not fitted, its {{development}} having been interrupted by repeated failures {{caused by the}} difficulty of producing suitable high temperature resistant alloys. As a result, it was cancelled by the (S.T.Aé). The Wib 3 continued its flight testing until the autumn of 1923, after which the high altitude specification was withdrawn.|$|R
25|$|The Ki-87 was {{developed}} in response to American B-29 Superfortress raids on the Home Islands. It followed up on earlier research by Nakajima and the Technical Division of Imperial Army Headquarters into boosting a large radial engine with an exhaust-driven <b>turbo-supercharger,</b> which had begun in 1942, well before the B-29 raids began. The efforts of the Technical Division of Imperial Army Headquarters eventually culminated into the Tachikawa Ki-94-I, while the Ki-87 {{was developed}} as a fall-back project, using less stringent requirements. Nakajima started in July 1943 {{with the construction of}} three prototypes, to be completed between November 1944 and January 1945, and seven pre-production aircraft, to be delivered by April 1945. The Technical Division of Imperial Army Headquarters made itself felt during the development of the Ki-87 prototype when they insisted upon placing the <b>turbo-supercharger</b> in the rear-fuselage, and from the sixth prototype the Nakajima fighter was to have that arrangement. The Ki-87 had a rearward folding undercarriage to accommodate the storage of ammunition for the cannons, which were mounted in the wing.|$|R
2500|$|... had {{a rather}} abrupt, {{dome-shaped}} nose housing the [...] Hispano-Suiza 8Fb water-cooled V-8 engine and its [...] <b>turbo-supercharger.</b> The engine was mounted with its output shaft low down in the nose and drove a two-blade propeller. [...] Though this was of the wooden, fixed-pitch type, it was intended {{that it would be}} replaced by a variable-pitch Lavasseur airscrew later. A single, roughly cylindrical Lamblin radiator was suspended below the engine, between the undercarriage legs.|$|R
5000|$|An {{important}} {{issue in the}} design was that it should use off-the-shelf technology (parts and know-how). As a result, in mass production it should not cost significantly more than a 'heavier' equivalent. The engine should even be cheaper because it is made of fewer parts. However, parts {{that would be more}} expensive are supercharging (be it pressure wave supercharger or <b>turbo-supercharger)</b> and the wheels and the wheel suspension, which are made of aluminium.|$|R
