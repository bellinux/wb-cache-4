5|$|Over {{the years}} {{scholars}} have postulated {{a number of}} theories about what Stowe was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with the novel (aside from the obvious themes, such as condemning slavery). For example, as an ardent Christian and active abolitionist, Stowe placed many of her religious beliefs into the novel. Some scholars have stated that Stowe saw her novel as offering {{a solution to the}} moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Was the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible? Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris? Stowe's solution was similar to Ralph Waldo Emerson's: God's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.|$|E

Misinterpretation of the flashing driver's intent can cause crashes.|$|E

500|$|Whiteread's agent Karsten Schubert said, [...] "The {{whole affair}} was a non-event. They {{achieved}} nothing {{and they were}} left looking like real prats." [...] Peter Chater, a director of Schubert's agency concurred; he called Drummond and Cauty [...] "cowards". [...] "It was obviously a publicity stunt. What sort of statement {{they were trying to}} make I don't know. If it was {{anything to do with the}} relationship between art and money it was pretty crass. The KLF made a fortune from a couple of successful singles. Artists aren't in that position. Threatening to set light to £40,000 is pretty obscene." [...] Former Factory Records boss Tony Wilson applauded the group, however. [...] "The K Foundation is a very peculiar avant garde group whose ideas are as valid anything the Turner people do," [...] he told NME. [...] "Since when has there been laws governing what constitutes art, or an artistic statement? OK, so a lot of people don't understand what Bill and Jimmy are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but how many people know exactly what Rachel Whiteread's <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with her art?" ...|$|E

Hall {{ultimately}} wrote songs such as [...] "Does Anybody Hear Her" [...] and [...] "Stained Glass Masquerade", which [...] "challenge believers". According to Hall, he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he didn't think it bothers the world if people in the church sin. Rather, he felt that the world is bothered when Christians act like they don't sin.|$|E
500|$|The Nazi in {{this episode}} {{appears to be}} Reichsführer of the Schutzstaffel, Heinrich Himmler. Aside from looking like the character, Himmler was also both a Nordicist and a Nazi Occultist. At {{one point in the}} episode, a scared elderly woman points at him screaming, [...] "It's him... it's him...!" [...] This has a double meaning, as she could have been saying [...] "It's him!" [...] or she could have been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "It's Himmler!" ...|$|E

500|$|Moran {{apologized for}} the remarks, saying that [...] "I should not have singled out the Jewish {{community}} and regret giving any impression that its members are somehow responsible for the course of action being pursued by the administration, or are somehow behind an impending war... What I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> is that if more organizations in this country, including religious groups, were more outspoken against war, then I do not think we would be pursuing war as an option." ...|$|E

500|$|Khan {{claimed that}} he was [...] "not surprised" [...] that Taare Zameen Par was not {{included}} in the Academy Award shortlist, and argued, [...] "I don’t make films for awards.

What I am <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> is that film has been well loved across the globe and that for me it is extremely heartening and something that I give very high value to." ...|$|E

500|$|Cudi {{commented that}} the way the song was {{recorded}} {{was similar to the}} way prior collaborations between the two were recorded; West will bounce ideas off of other writers and gauge their reaction before going forward with any of his own ideas. In an interview with MTV Cudi commented, [...] "that's always our collab formula, and that's just how 'Gorgeous' came about. He just kind of told me what he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> I threw out some words, we rearranged words, and we came out with a bunch of different options before we come up with the hook." ...|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, {{character}} designer Tatsuhiko Kanaoka, {{better known}} as [...] "Falcoon", said K' {{was one of his}} favorite original King of Fighters characters. Music composer Sha-V suggested that K' should yell [...] "Dora!" [...] or [...] "Ora!" [...] to mirror Kyo and Iori's shouts, [...] "Kurae!" [...] and [...] "Doushita!" [...] respectively. Konny, another music composer, jokingly wondered if K' is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the word [...] "dry", since the first word of his yell was [...] "Dorei!" [...] Originally, K' was voiced by Yuuki Matsuda. However, by The King of Fighters XIV, he was replaced by Yoshihisa Kawahara.|$|E
500|$|... "Inside Out" [...] is an electropop {{song that}} {{features}} themes of dubstep and R, complimented with [...] "earth-shattering synths". Lyrically, the [...] "sexy breakup song", {{as described by}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV, opens with Spears singing, [...] "Said you're gonna {{be here in a}} minute/ Sitting in the mirror getting pretty/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ I can hear you knocking at the front door/ And I know exactly what you came for/ <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye but it's hot and heavy/ <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye but it's hot and heavy." [...] While the couple seems {{to be on the verge}} of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." [...] Spears crescendos [...] "So come on/Won't you give me something to remember/Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out." [...] during the chorus section, and then goes on to [...] "Hit me one more time it's so amazing" [...] and [...] "You're the only one who's ever drove me crazy" [...] referencing her first singles [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998) and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] (1999). The song was compared to her earlier work on albums In the Zone (2003) and Circus (2008) and it has been compared to that of Madonna's Ray of Light (1998) and Music (2000). The [...] "futuristic-sounding, slow-grooving tune" [...] was also considered reminiscent of Janet Jackson.|$|E

500|$|After she {{graduated}} from high school, Sanders left her foster parents' home in Detroit to study at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), a historically black college in Alabama that was Lorenzo Malloy's alma mater. She intended to earn a degree in education and become a teacher. When she left Detroit to go to Alabama, her foster mother stood {{at the train station}} crying. Shabazz later recalled that Malloy was trying to mumble something, but the words would not come out. By the time she arrived in Alabama, she felt she knew what her foster mother was saying. [...] "The minute I got off that train, I knew what she was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> She was trying to tell me in ten words or less about racism." ...|$|E
500|$|Nellie {{does not}} sing {{together}} with Emile, because Rodgers promised Martin {{that she would}} not have to compete vocally with Pinza, but the composer sought to unite them in the underlying music. [...] A tetrachord, heard before we see either lead, is played during the instrumental introduction to [...] "Dites-Moi", the show's first song. [...] Considered as pitch classes, that is, as pitches without characterization by octave or register, the motif is C-B-A-G. It will be heard repeatedly in Nellie's music, or in the music (such as [...] "Twin Soliloquies") that she shares with Emile, and even in the bridge of [...] "Some Enchanted Evening". [...] Lovensheimer argues that this symbolizes what Nellie is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with her Act II line [...] "We're the same sort of people fundamentally– you and me".|$|E
500|$|After {{concluding}} the European and Japanese legs {{of their}} tour on August 8, the band withdrew from public view. The early development of Holy Wood coincided with Manson's three-month seclusion {{at his home}} in the Hollywood Hills, during which he considered how to respond to the controversy. Manson said the maelstrom made him re-evaluate his career: [...] "There was a bit of trepidation, [...] deciding: 'Is it worth it? Are people understanding what I'm <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say?</b> Am I even gonna be allowed to say it?' Because I definitely had every single door shut in my face... there were {{not a lot of people}} who stood behind me." [...] He told Alternative Press that he felt his safety was threatened to the point that he [...] "could be shot Mark David Chapman-style." [...] He began work on the album as a counterattack.|$|E

500|$|Hillenburg {{enjoyed the}} process of making the film: [...] "The TV {{schedule}} is tight, and you don't always {{have a lot of time}} to work on your drawings." [...] He appreciated the film's hand-drawn animation: [...] "I think the movie's drawings are much superior than the TV show", although CGI animation was flourishing at the time of the film's release. [...] "There's a lot of talk about 2-D being dead, and I hope people don't think that. Even Brad Bird is a proponent of 2-D. He would agree with me that it's all about what you're <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> There are many ways to tell a story, and what's unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story." [...] The clay animation scenes were shot by Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan at Screen Novelties in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|In Nashville, Swift {{worked with}} {{experienced}} Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and The Warren Brothers. She eventually formed a lasting {{working relationship with}} Liz Rose. They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school. Rose thought that the sessions were [...] "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write {{about what happened in}} school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks". Swift was signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house, but left RCA Records when she was 14. She later recalled: [...] "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through".|$|E
500|$|Depending {{on their}} {{language}} and cognitive skills, those with aphasia may use AAC interventions such as communication and memory books, drawing, photography, written words, speech generating devices and keyboards. Visual scene displays {{have been used}} on communication devices with adults who have chronic, severe aphasia; these feature photos of people, places or events that are meaningful to the individual and facilitative of communicative interaction. Approaches such as [...] "Supported Conversation for Adults with Aphasia" [...] train the communication partners to use resources such as writing key words, providing written choices, drawing, and using items such as photographs and maps to help the individual with aphasia produce and comprehend conversation. Communication boards can be very helpful for patients with aphasia, especially with patients who are very severe. They can be produced at a very low tech level, and can be utilized by patients to point to pictures/words they are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Communication boards are extremely functional and help patients with aphasia communicate their needs.|$|E
