25|$|Some {{people think}} that—excuse my {{expression}} here—that {{in order to}} be good Catholics we have to be like rabbits. No. Responsible parenthood. This is clear and that is why in the Church there are marriage groups, there are experts in this matter, there are pastors, one can search; and I know so many ways that are licit and <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> this.|$|E

25|$|As {{an urban}} settlement, Carrickfergus far pre-dates {{the capital city}} Belfast and was for a lengthy period both larger and more {{prominent}} than the nearby city. Belfast Lough itself was known as 'Carrickfergus Bay' well into the 17th century. Carrickfergus {{and the surrounding area}} was, for a time, treated as a separate county. The historical walled town originally occupied an area of around 97,000 square metres, which now comprises the town centre, bordered by Albert Road to the west, the Marine Highway to the south, Shaftesbury Park to the north and Joymount Presbyterian Church grounds to the east. Segments of the town wall are still visible {{in various parts of the}} town and in various states of preservation. Archaeological excavations close to the walls' foundations have yielded many artefacts <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> historians piece together a picture of the lives of the 12th and 13th century inhabitants.|$|E

500|$|Analogue pizza cheeses may be {{formulated}} {{for processing}} with less sophisticated cheese-making equipment than {{is required for}} Mozzarella cheese, such as using simple mixing and molding. They {{tend to have a}} soft texture and once melted, may have a slightly [...] "stringy" [...] quality when pulled or bitten into. They may lack in a fusion, or melting together of the shredded product when cooked, in which the cheese gels together. New stabilizer systems have been developed <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> to enable the creation of analogue pizza cheeses.|$|E

"Bam Thwok" [...] debuted {{at number}} one on {{an early version of}} the UK Download Chart, {{although}} one report said that the fact that the Pixies were in first place despite releasing the single halfway through the period surveyed and only through iTunes [...] "suggests there could be problems to iron out... all iTunes owners are big fans of the Pixies." [...] In a press release from Apple, Pixies manager Ken Goes said: [...] "By distributing our first song in 13 years exclusively on iTunes, we were able to quickly and inexpensively make it available to millions of fans in the US and Europe. One week after its release, we are thrilled at the response from iTunes users <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> to make [...] "Bam Thwok" [...] a top seller across four countries." ...|$|E
500|$|By region, {{studies have}} {{revealed}} specific details <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> outline {{the series of}} events that led to the extinction of the local megafauna. [...] In the Central Highlands, dense forests existed until 1600 CE, with lingering patches persisting until the 19th and 20th centuries. [...] Today, small fragments stand isolated among vast expanses of human-created savanna, despite an average annual rainfall that is sufficient to sustain the evergreen forests once found there. [...] Deliberately set fires were the cause of the deforestation, and forest regrowth is restricted by soil erosion and the presence of fire-resistant, exotic grasses. [...] In the southeast, an extended drought dating to 950 cal yr BP led to fires and transition of open grasslands. [...] The drought may also have pushed humans populations to rely more heavily on bushmeat. [...] Had humans not been present, the subfossil lemur populations might have adjusted to the new conditions and recovered. [...] Had the drought not reduced the population of the subfossil lemurs, the pressure from the small number of people living in the region at the time might not have been enough to cause the extinctions. [...] As in the past, all of the factors that {{have played a role in}} past extinctions are still present and active today. [...] As a result, the extinction event that claimed Madagascar's giant subfossil lemurs has not fully concluded.|$|E

2500|$|According to Simmons, [...] "The {{murders in}} Juárez {{would not have}} drawn such {{national}} and international attention {{if it were not}} for the heroic efforts of the victims' families and other women." [...] There have been numerous local and international organizations <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> draw attention to the issue of the murder of women in Juárez which has helped to create pressure for the Mexican government to agree to further its efforts to respond to violence against women. Further, the work of political leaders, activists, artists, academics, and journalists combined have also been instrumental in bringing international attention to the murder of women in Juárez and the issues that surround them.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2010, Karzai {{travelled}} to Japan for {{a five-day}} visit {{where the two}} nations discussed a new aid provided by the hosting nation and the untapped mineral resources recently announced. Karzai invited Japanese companies such as Mitsubishi and others to invest in Afghan mining projects. He told Japanese officials that Japan would be given priority in the bid to explore its resources. He stated, [...] "morally, Afghanistan should give access as a priority to those countries <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> Afghanistan massively {{in the past few}} years." [...] While in Japan, Karzai also made his first visit to Hiroshima to pray for the atomic bomb victims. Japan has provided billions of dollars in aid to Afghanistan since the beginning of 2002.|$|E

2500|$|Referring to that, in July 2011, Townshend wrote at his blog: [...] "My {{hearing is}} {{actually}} {{better than ever}} because after a feedback scare at the indigO2 in December 2008 I am taking good care of it. I have computer systems in my studio <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> me do my engineering work on the forthcoming Quadrophenia release. I have had assistance from younger forensic engineers and mastering engineers to help me clean up the high frequencies {{that are out of}} my range. The same computer systems work wonderfully well on stage, proving to be perfect for me when the Who performed at the Super Bowl and doing Quadrophenia for TCT at the Royal Albert Hall in 2010. I'm 66, I don't have perfect hearing, and if I listen to loud music or go to gigs I do tend to get tinnitus." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the attention, Sansone was flooded with {{questions}} from the public. [...] In response, she began writing a book in 2004, full of common-sense tips about life and motherhood. [...] The book was published in December 2005, {{a few months after the}} birth of her 10th child. Parents magazine reviewed it as a [...] "collection of advice and insights <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> her balance children, marriage, and time for herself." [...] A reviewer for the Baltimore Sun said the book, [...] "isn't the best-written book you will find. [...] But it's an inspiring, uplifting read, and sometimes that's as valuable as great literature." [...] The Fort Worth Star-Telegram said, [...] "The book doesn't offer any earth-shattering revelations. Instead, it offers recipes, workout tips and enough cute anecdotes that, by the last chapter, you're willing to forgive her for having that flawless figure." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, Vanita {{condenses}} {{the ideas}} {{in her book}} into an article, [...] "Same-sex Weddings, Hindu Traditions and Modern India". Here, she summarizes specific cases in which women specifically committed joint-suicides, were married and separated, or successfully married. She points out three different [...] "forces <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> female couples". These are: the law courts, the media, and some Hindu authorities (such as the swamis mentioned earlier in this article) from her book. [...] When female couples can stay together under the social pressures {{and get to the}} courts, the courts generally hold up their decisions, holding {{to the fact that the}} women are consenting adults. While this does not necessarily stop the harassment, it does lend the couple further legitimacy under the laws. In addition, the more successful same-sex marriages of women are those in which the women are financially independent. If they have social support from their families and community—for the most part—then they may be able to live in peace together. The media may also play an important role in same-sex marriages. In drawing attention to their marriages, women who do not necessarily know about LGBT rights groups may be contacted and supported by those groups after media attention. However, the flip side of this is that the anti-LGBT groups also may reach out against their marriage.|$|E
