25|$|Since 1961, the Tijuca National Park (Parque Nacional da Tijuca), {{the largest}} city-surrounded urban forest {{and the second}} largest urban forest in the world, has been a National Park. The largest urban forest {{in the world is}} the Floresta da Pedra Branca (White Rock Forest), which is also located in the West Zone of Rio de Janeiro. The Pontifical Catholic University of Rio (Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro or PUC-Rio), Brazil's top private university, is located at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> in the Gávea district.

25|$|The Sultan's Copper Tents, {{originally}} three {{buildings for}} the palace guard, {{designed by the}} painter Louis Jean Desprez and built during 1787 to 1790. Desprez proposed that all the façades of the buildings should be designed as three Turkish tents, clad in decoratively painted copper plate. However, tent façades were only built on the side facing the main lawns, which still gives the desired illusion of a sultan's encampment on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|E

25|$|Maria Antonia {{formally}} renounced her {{rights to}} Habsburg domains, and on 19 April {{she was married}} by proxy to the Dauphin of France at the Augustinian Church in Vienna, with her brother Archduke Ferdinand standing in for the Dauphin.

A further ceremonial wedding took place on 16 May 1770 in the Palace of Versailles and, after the festivities, the day ended with the ritual bedding. The lack of a marriage consummation plagued the reputation of both Louis-Auguste and Marie Antoinette {{for the next seven}} years.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800, the {{regiment}} {{was part of}} Emmanuel de Grouchy's division.

After initial Austrian success, Grouchy's troops pushed their enemies back to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> The 4th Hussars tried twice to overrun an Austrian battery and were successful on their third charge. Merlin sent a hussar squadron against some nearby infantry and sent them fleeing. From 1801–1803 he served in the garrison at Cambrai. He participated in the successful French 1803 invasion of the Electorate of Hanover which ended in the Convention of Artlenburg.

25|$|As {{so often}} {{in the history of}} the abbey things did not go smoothly; {{preparing}} the site took considerable time and the first monks, led by Abbot John Chaumpeneys, did not arrive at Darnhall from Dore Abbey until 1274. The foundation of the new abbey provoked anger, resentment and strong resistance from the people of the area and the Darnhall site itself was found to be unsuitable for the huge buildings planned. In 1276 Edward, by now king, agreed to move the abbey to a better site and a location was chosen in nearby Over on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> of Mondrem. With its foundation, the new ecclesiastical site was named Vale Royal. In 1277 the King and Queen Eleanor and numerous great nobles arrived at Over to lay the foundation stones of the new abbey. In 1281 the monks moved from Darnhall to temporary accommodation on the Vale Royal site while the abbey started to rise around them.|$|E
500|$|Like the {{exterior}} of the building, the principal internal spaces are designed to make the best use of natural materials in their natural state. The structure and detail of the concourse galleries echo the form of {{the exterior}}, with the curving strata formed in native hardwoods. Oak, ash, beech, sycamore, alder, birch, chestnut and cherry woods from renewable sources in mid-Wales will be used together in proportions that reflect their relative availability from the forest. The design of the concourse galleries is intended to evoke the image of <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> partly as a counterpoint to the coastal nature of the exterior, and partly because <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> in folklore and mythology represents a line between the real world and the magical world, a line which resembles the front edge of the theatre stage. The form of trees is created by the interweaving curvature of the gallery edges, and by the random positioning of the supporting columns. —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E

When they reached Kīlauea after two days, their guide Puhano headed off to the established ʻAinapō Trail.

500|$|The Mikea are a {{group of}} Malagasy-speaking horticulturalists and foragers who are often {{described}} as the hunter-gatherers of Madagascar. [...] They inhabit the Mikea Forest, a patch of mixed spiny forest and dry deciduous forest {{along the coast of}} southwestern Madagascar. The Mikea are predominantly of Sakalava origin, although the term describes a lifestyle rather than an ethnic group per se, and individuals from a variety of Malagasy ethnic groups are found among the Mikea. The family encampments of the Mikea shift from prime corn planting territory at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> in the rainy season to the interior forest rich with tenrecs and other game in the dry season, when the community becomes highly dependent on spongy tubers to meet their daily demand for water. Their lifestyle is interdependent with that of their neighboring Vezo fishermen and the Masikoro farmers and herders, with whom they trade products caught, foraged or cultivated in the forest. Many Mikea also occasionally engage in paid work such as guarding the zebu herds or tending the corn fields of others.|$|E

Domino tries to convince Manny to take over his position in the plant seeing as he has no alternative and can spend the rest of eternity with Meche but he refuses. After rescuing Meche, Manny defeats Domino by causing him to fall into a rock crusher. Manny, along with Meche, Glottis and all the souls being held at the plant then escape from the Edge of the World.|$|E
