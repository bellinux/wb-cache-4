5|$|The prior era saw great {{military}} successes, {{and great}} economic failures, while the patriotism of the Plebeians had {{kept them from}} seeking any new reforms. Now, however, the military situation had stabilized, and fewer soldiers were needed.

The flood of unemployed citizens to Rome had made the assemblies quite populist, and thus had created an increasingly aggressive democracy. <b>This</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> began with the Tribunate of Gaius Gracchus, and ended when Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon river.|$|E
5|$|Tailapa II, a Rashtrakuta feudatory ruling from Tardavadi– 1000 (Bijapur district) overthrew KarkaII, re-established the Chalukya rule in {{the western}} Deccan and {{recovered}} most of the Chalukya empire. The Western Chalukyas ruled for over 200 years and were in constant conflict with the Cholas, and with their cousins, the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi. VikramadityaVI is widely considered the most notable ruler of the dynasty. Starting {{from the very beginning}} of his reign, which lasted fifty years, he abolished the original Saka era and established the Vikrama Era. Most subsequent Chalukya inscriptions are dated in <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>era.</b> VikramadityaVI was an ambitious and skilled military leader. Under his leadership the Western Chalukyas were able to end the Chola influence over Vengi (coastal Andhra) and become the dominant power in the Deccan. The Western Chalukya period was an important age in the development of Kannada literature and Sanskrit literature. They went into their final dissolution towards the end of the 12th century with the rise of the Hoysala Empire, the Pandyas, the Kakatiya and the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri.|$|E

25|$|The 1659–1660 {{voyage of}} French traders Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Médard Chouart des Groseilliers {{into the country}} north and west of Lake Superior symbolically opened <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> of expansion. Their trading voyage proved {{extremely}} lucrative in furs. More importantly, they learned of a frozen sea to the north that provided {{easy access to the}} fur-bearing interior. Upon their return, French officials confiscated the furs of these unlicensed coureurs des bois. Radisson and Groseilliers went to Boston and then to London to secure funding and two ships to explore the Hudson Bay. Their success led to England's chartering of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1670, {{a major player in the}} fur trade for the next two centuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{attempt to}} {{continue}} as before as a low volume-high profit business enterprise with its core business in the spice trade had therefore failed. The Company had however already (reluctantly) followed the example of its European competitors in diversifying into other Asian commodities, like tea, coffee, cotton, textiles, and sugar. These commodities provided a lower profit margin and therefore required a larger sales volume to generate {{the same amount of}} revenue. This structural change in the commodity composition of the VOC's trade started in the early 1680s, after the temporary collapse of the EIC around 1683 offered an excellent opportunity to enter these markets. The actual cause for the change lies, however, in two structural features of <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>era.</b>|$|E

25|$|Because the U.S. {{government}} {{and state governments}} did not regulate churches, as was done in nations with established churches, the former British colonists and immigrants who made up the Catholic Church in the new land had varying ideas {{as to how to}} structure their local parish communities in <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>era.</b> Some set up churches run entirely by laity without Carroll's permission, and in other cases clergy exercised excessive control. Carroll sought to navigate a new way of organizing the Church in a new country, taking into account both the need for lay involvement and a reasonable degree of hierarchical control. In 1791, the formal message of congratulations from American Catholics to President George Washington on his election was co-signed by Carroll and lay Catholics.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{protesting the}} strenuous {{nature of the}} players' {{workload}} in <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>era,</b> Chappell found himself leading the team to Pakistan {{two weeks after the}} end of the Australian season. Pakistan narrowly won the first Test, then prepared featherbed wickets for the remaining two matches. At Faisalabad, Chappell made 235 and as a protest at the pitch, allowed all eleven Australians to have a bowl in Pakistan's innings – the first time this had happened in a Test since 1884. Australia lost the series 0–1. Later in the year, Australia played a second Centenary Test, this time to commemorate the first Test played in England, and the match (played at Lords) ended in a draw due to poor weather. One of only four players who played both matches, Chappell scored 47 and 59, but his best remembered contribution to the match was an attempted citizen's arrest (along with England captain Ian Botham) of an MCC member who attacked one of the umpires in a very ill-tempered scene.|$|E
25|$|Although GM R (as it {{is known}} in colloquial shorthand) began as an {{organization}} largely built around one man (Kettering), it eventually evolved into a more modern organization whose path is shaped by individuals but not dominated entirely by any of them. World War II {{was a turning point}} wherein military affairs, after mingling with the technologies of applied science for some 80 years, first started to become fundamentally reinvented by them. Civilian life, too, changed in this direction. By the 1950s, corporations such as GM and many others were facing a new era of R, different from earlier ones. Less about genius inventors and individual inventions, and more about organizational progress and integrated systems, it raised new questions about where the capital for R would come from in an era of limitless demand for R (although not necessarily for production). Alfred Sloan, longtime CEO of GM (1920s to 1960s), discussed in his memoir (also considered a seminal management treatise) the relationships between government, academia, and private industry in the areas of basic science and applied science, in light of <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>era.</b> The views he laid out reflected (and influenced) wide consensus on these relationships that persists largely to today.|$|E

Nevertheless, all of these groups remained under Xu's influence to varying degrees.

2500|$|Gropius was not {{necessarily}} against Expressionism, and in fact himself in the same 1919 pamphlet proclaiming this [...] "new guild of craftsmen, without the class snobbery," [...] described [...] "painting and sculpture rising to heaven {{out of the hands}} of a million craftsmen, the crystal symbol of the new faith of the future." [...] By 1923 however, Gropius was no longer evoking images of soaring Romanesque cathedrals and the craft-driven aesthetic of the [...] "Völkisch movement", instead declaring [...] "we want an architecture adapted to our world of machines, radios and fast cars." [...] Gropius argued that a new period of history had begun with the end of the war. He wanted to create a new architectural style to reflect <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>era.</b> His style in architecture and consumer goods was to be functional, cheap and consistent with mass production. To these ends, Gropius wanted to reunite art and craft to arrive at high-end functional products with artistic merit. The Bauhaus issued a magazine called Bauhaus and a series of books called [...] "Bauhausbücher". Since the Weimar Republic lacked the quantity of raw materials available to the United States and Great Britain, it had to rely on the proficiency of a skilled labor force and an ability to export innovative and high quality goods. Therefore, designers were needed and so was a new type of art education. The school's philosophy stated that the artist should be trained to work with the industry.|$|E

The magnitude of the task before us will require decisive action and the highest levels of collaboration and we must prove ourselves and our efforts to be equal to the enormity of the task. We simply cannot reach our development goals, or advance human well-being without addressing the needs and challenges of women and youth, while also making use of the contributions of the both. With some 1.4 billion people without reliable electricity; 900 million lacking access to clean water and 2.6 billion without adequate sanitation, action is urgently needed to address these persistent challenges. With so many initiatives in these three fields, let us try and draw upon and share the existing knowledge, while scaling up initiatives that have already worked in the areas of integrated water management, sustainable energy and sanitation services for the proposed post-2015 development agenda." [...] Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon then said: [...] "We will intensify our efforts to define a post-2015 development agenda, including with a single set of goals for sustainable development that we hope will address the complex challenges of <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> and capture the imagination {{of the people of the}} world, as the MDGs did.
