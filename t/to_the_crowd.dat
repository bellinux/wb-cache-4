5|$|The day {{started with}} a speech from Lord Rowe-Beddoe, {{chairman}} of Wales Millennium Centre, who declared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> that the proceedings were under way. This {{was followed by a}} speech from Rhodri Morgan, the First Minister, who stressed that the new arts centre belonged to the whole nation, that it was for all of the people of Wales and not just for the elite.|$|E
5|$|The unusually heavy smog {{was evident}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> of one million onlookers at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Tabloids and {{newspapers}} that ordinarily ran front-page {{stories about the}} parade instead carried stories about the smog. Health officials cautioned those with chronic lung diseases to stay indoors and advised patients that symptoms of pollution-related illness usually lagged 24 hours after exposure.|$|E
5|$|Between 9:00pm and 10:00pm {{the guards}} enacted a {{strategy}} whereby the police officers, {{backed by the}} bayonets of the soldiers, advanced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> and arrested each a man, who was then taken into the station, disarmed, and held there. The strategy was largely successful, and by 11:00pm {{the area around the}} station was mostly cleared, though sporadic gunfire could be heard throughout the night. Between 165 and 200 were detained in total, and the most violent of the captives were removed and taken to the police station. The news reported that four, including one police officer, were injured in the exchange, and several who resisted arrest were beaten severely.|$|E

5|$|Blythe further {{testified that}} he was not under the {{influence}} of alcohol during the concert and that he had never used any drugs. Chris Adler, Lamb of God's drummer, {{testified that he}} had not seen anything from the back of the stage and further proclaimed that Blythe's aggressiveness is only a stage act. According to Adler, Blythe is a calm, moderate, and well-read person. The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> but not to encourage people to climb the stage.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a career}} high in {{appearances}} in 2004, Rivera did not throw during the offseason, unlike previous years. His 2005 season began {{on a low}} note. After missing time in spring training with elbow bursitis, he blew his first two save opportunities of the season against the Red Sox, marking four consecutive blown opportunities against Boston {{dating back to the}} previous postseason. Fans at Yankee Stadium booed Rivera, and baseball journalists speculated if his days as a dominant pitcher were over. He was subsequently cheered by Red Sox fans during pre-game introductions at Fenway Park the following week, in recognition of his struggles against the Red Sox. He responded to the ovation {{with a sense of humor}} by tipping his cap <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} career, after scoring a goal, Del Piero often celebrated by {{running to the}} touchline {{in front of the}} fans with his arms out-stretched, and {{sticking}} out his tongue, in a similar manner to Michael Jordan, also frequently leaping into the air with a raised fist towards the sky, or sliding onto his knees whilst passionately chanting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Del Piero also performed a back-flip goal celebration in a 2008 UEFA Champions League match against Zenit, and he also pointed up at the sky after scoring on certain occasions, to dedicate a goal to his late father, such as when he scored against Bari during the 2000–01 season, and Mexico at the 2002 World Cup.|$|E

5|$|In the Synoptics, Jesus and {{his disciples}} {{go to the}} garden Gethsemane, where Jesus prays to be spared his coming ordeal. Then Judas comes with an armed mob, sent by the chief priests, scribes and elders. He kisses Jesus to {{identify}} him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> which then arrests Jesus. In an attempt to stop them, an unnamed disciple of Jesus uses a sword {{to cut off the}} ear of a man in the crowd. After Jesus' arrest, his disciples go into hiding, and Peter, when questioned, thrice denies knowing Jesus. After the third denial, Peter hears the rooster crow and recalls Jesus' prediction about his denial. Peter then weeps bitterly.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, 2012, Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine {{publicly}} questioned Youkilis' {{motivation and}} physical ability to succeed. Viewing rookie Will Middlebrooks as the superior third baseman, Valentine {{began to play}} Middlebrooks over Youkilis. The Red Sox traded Youkilis to the Chicago White Sox on June 24 for pitcher Zach Stewart and utility man Brent Lillibridge. The Red Sox agreed to pay $5.5 million of Youkilis' salary to help close the deal. In the seventh inning of that day's game, Ben Cherington, the Red Sox General Manager, informed Valentine that a transaction was pending. Youkilis hit a triple in his last at bat, and received a long standing ovation while tipping his helmet <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> after being taken out for pinch runner Nick Punto.|$|E
5|$|On June 9, Reagan's casket {{was removed}} from the presidential library and driven in a {{motorcade}} to NAS Point Mugu in Oxnard, California; it was the same airfield Reagan flew into and out of during his presidency when visiting his California ranch. SAM 28000, one of the two Boeing 747-200s, which usually serves the president as Air Force One, arrived to transport the casket to Washington. Thousands of people gathered to witness the plane's departure. Just before she boarded the VC-25A Presidential Aircraft, Nancy Reagan waved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> with her military escort at her side. The plane lifted off at about 9:40am PST.|$|E

5|$|The {{most heavily}} {{promoted}} feud {{going into the}} event was between Bam Bam Bigelow and Lawrence Taylor. At Royal Rumble 1995, Bigelow teamed with Tatanka {{in the final round}} of a tournament for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Bigelow was pinned {{at the end of the}} match, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> heckling him. He responded by pushing NFL player Lawrence Taylor, who was sitting at ringside. Bigelow refused to apologize and instead challenged Taylor to a wrestling match. Taylor agreed and trained with WWF World Heavyweight Champion Diesel to prepare for the match. The storyline between Bigelow and Taylor brought the WWF much mainstream exposure, as the match was discussed by several news outlets.|$|E
5|$|To prevent Jewish {{violence}} from further escalating, Agrippa assembled the populace and delivered a tearful speech <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> {{in the company}} of his sister, but the Jews alienated their sympathies when the insurgents burned down their palaces. They fled the city to Galilee where they later gave themselves up to the Romans. Meanwhile, Cestius Gallus moved into the region with the twelfth legion, but was unable to restore order and suffered defeat at the battle of Beth-Horon, forcing the Romans to retreat from Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-two teams {{participated in}} the 2013 edition of the Tour de France. All of the {{nineteen}} UCI ProTeams were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race. On 27 April 2013, the organiser of the Tour, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), announced the three second-tier UCI Professional Continental teams given wildcard invitations, {{all of which were}} French-based. The presentation of the teams took place at the harbour of Porto-Vecchio on 28 June, two days before the start of opening stage held in the town. Each team arrived by boat to the stage, before being introduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b>|$|E

5|$|Undaunted by {{this lack}} of {{confidence}} from his peers, Johnson continued to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was more vigorous than that of Van Buren, his behavior {{on the campaign trail}} raised concern among voters. He made rambling, incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, he raised his shirt in order to display <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> the wounds he received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he leveled against Harrison in Cleveland were so poorly received that they touched off a riot in the city.|$|E
5|$|His {{character}} {{took on a}} {{more sinister}} direction on the November 27, 2009, episode of SmackDown when he revealed that he had converted Luke Gallows, who had previously been portrayed as the mentally incompetent wrestler Festus, to the straight-edge lifestyle which had rid him of his mental troubles. Continuing to espouse his straight-edge philosophy, Punk began to present himself as a cult-like savior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> growing the hair on his head, face and chest in an allusion to Jesus. Through January 2010, Punk began to convert planted {{members of the audience}} to a straight-edge lifestyle, making them take a pledge of allegiance to him and shaving their head as a sign of renewal and devotion. After converting many people who were not seen again, convert Serena began accompanying Punk and Gallows to form the Straight Edge Society. As well as leading this alliance, Punk was also the mentor of WWE NXT rookie Darren Young who flirted with the idea of becoming straight-edge before refusing just before his head was to be shaved.|$|E

Team members Chelsea Suddith, Katie Burns, Niles Butts, Andrew Heath, Cristian Ruiz, Cady Studdard and Evan Swinney were requested by the President to stand at the event and speak <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> about the rocketry accomplishments, which included achieving victory among contestants at the 2015 International Rocketry Challenge at the Paris Air Show. The students were able to meet celebrities who attended the event, including: Bill Nye, and MythBusters co-hosts Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage.|$|E

It was {{composed}} by president Cornelio Saavedra, members Manuel Alberti, Miguel de Azcuénaga, Manuel Belgrano, Juan José Castelli, Domingo Matheu and Juan Larrea, and secretaries Juan José Paso and Mariano Moreno. The rules governing it were {{roughly the same}} as those issued the day before, with the additional provisions that the Cabildo would watch over the members of the Junta and that the Junta itself would appoint replacements in case of vacancies. Saavedra spoke <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> and then moved on to the Fort, among salvos of artillery and the ringing of bells. Meanwhile, Cisneros dispatched a post rider to Córdoba, Argentina, to warn Santiago de Liniers about what had happened in Buenos Aires and to request military action against the Junta.|$|E
