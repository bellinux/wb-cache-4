He compared his relationship to Frost to that of Bill and Hillary Clinton, calling them [...] "a power couple" [...] and adding, [...] "I think that Chadwick was probably attracted to her because of her beauty, [...] also a very smart woman, very successful, also probably a Type A. We really strive, both of us I <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> very successful actress and with a very successful business. The world is our oyster. We’re going to make as many pearls as we can." ...|$|E
500|$|Bond is {{introduced}} to Tanaka—and to the Japanese lifestyle—by an Australian intelligence officer, Dikko Henderson. When Bond raises {{the purpose of}} his mission with Tanaka, it transpires that the Japanese have already penetrated the British information source and Bond has nothing left to bargain with. Instead, Tanaka asks Bond to kill Dr. Guntram Shatterhand, who operates a politically embarrassing [...] "Garden of Death" [...] in an ancient castle; people flock there to commit suicide. After examining photos of Shatterhand and his wife, Bond discovers that [...] "Shatterhand" [...] {{and his wife are}} Tracy's murderers, Ernst Stavro Blofeld and Irma Bunt. Bond gladly takes the mission, keeping his knowledge of Blofeld's identity a secret so that he can exact revenge for his wife's death. Made up and trained by Tanaka, and aided by former Japanese film star Kissy Suzuki, Bond attempts to live and <b>think</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mute Japanese coal miner in order to penetrate Shatterhand's castle. Tanaka renames Bond [...] "Taro Todoroki" [...] for the mission.|$|E
500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t <b>think</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be. The whole idea is that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E

500|$|Since its {{original}} airing, critics have listed [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] {{among the best}} X-Files episodes. TV Guide called it the tenth greatest episode in television history. Review website IGN named it the best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series, writing that the episode [...] " [...] is a distinctive episode of the series, mixing a healthy amount of humor [...] with some very nasty business [...] In just 44 minutes, Boyle creates a fully formed character who makes a big impact in his one and only appearance." [...] Topless Robot named it the ninth-funniest episode of the series. Starpulse listed it as the third-best X-Files episode. Charlie Jane Anders and Javier Grillo-Marxuach of io9 included it {{on the list of}} [...] "10 TV Episodes that Changed Television". Tom Kessenich, in Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, named the episode the seventh-best installment of the series, noting that it features [...] "a wonderful blend of humor, drama, and pathos, something The X-Files did better than just about any other show this past decade." [...] The cast and crew of the series have expressed their enjoyment of the installment. Duchovny considers [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] to be one of his favorite episodes of the third season. Nutter highlighted it {{as one of the most}} enjoyable entries that he had worked on. He also noted that, [...] "the writing was so tight and so crisp and so fresh that I <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> director, the only thing you have to do is create the atmosphere, set up the characters, set up the shots and you are basically invisible. Then you step back and just let it happen." [...] Series writer and producer Frank Spotnitz stated that the episode worked on many levels and that it is his favorite of the episodes written for the show by Morgan. In 2016, Ira Madison of Vulture.com named it the best episode of the series and [...] "one of the best episodes of television ever", stating that the episode [...] "takes every element that made the series so iconic and throws them all into one heartbreaking installment".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{consistently}} warm reception towards Cox and her character, {{some aspects}} of Monica's characterization have been criticized. The second season episode [...] "The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies" [...] sparked controversy due to one of its storylines revolving around Monica and Rachel arguing over which roommate will win the last remaining condom in their apartment {{in order to have}} sex with their respective boyfriends, Richard and Ross. In her book Narratives, Health, and Healing: Communication Theory, Research, and Practice, author Lynn M. Harter defended the storyline, arguing that it promotes safe sex. Rachel eventually wins the condom in a game of rock, paper, scissors, forcing Monica to abstain for the night. Monica's overweight alter-ego [...] "Fat Monica" [...] has often been accused of being an offensive stereotype of overweight women exploited for laughs. Although identifying a formerly overweight character as [...] "a standard TV trope", the New Statesman's Bim Adewunmi wrote that Fat Monica [...] "always struck a weird note" [...] with the writer despite the show's efforts [...] "to pinpoint a solid and satisfying back-story for the character". Megan Kirby of xoJane questioned the negative effect the show's fat jokes would have on its overweight viewers, writing, [...] "What does this mean for the girls like me who never become thin? Are we relegated to side roles and stereotypes in our own lives? Of course, this isn’t true. But I think it sometimes, dark and secret: The fat girl doesn’t get to be the protagonist." [...] Emma Tarver of Feminspire complained that Fat Monica [...] "made me <b>think</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> child that I was unworthy of love, was going to be mocked relentlessly by my friends and family for my weight, and should never bother flirting because I would just disgust every man I looked at." [...] Contrarily, Kelsey Miller of Refinery29 received Fat Monica positively as [...] "proof I could overcome my disgusting plumpness and be seen as lovable, too". In spite of these complaints, Fat Monica proved so popular among audiences that the writers would resurrect the character for a total of four flashback episodes, each of which aired featuring Cox dressed as Fat Monica and eating a doughnut while dancing after the show had finished taping much to the amusement of the studio audience. Although she only appears physically in four, Fat Monica is referenced in approximately half of the show's episodes, and has since proven popular enough to be adapted into an internet meme.|$|E

2500|$|When Rudd {{announced}} {{his intention to}} issue an apology, the Liberal Party split on the issue in 2008. Its leader Brendan Nelson initially said that an apology would risk encouraging a [...] "culture of guilt" [...] in Australia. However, support for an apology was expressed by other senior Liberals, such as Malcolm Turnbull, Peter Costello, Bill Heffernan, and former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. Former Liberal minister Judi Moylan said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nation we owe an apology. We shouldn't be thinking about it as an individual apology— it's an apology that {{is coming from the}} nation state because it was governments that did these things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cruyff nearly {{retired in}} 1978. But after losing {{most of his}} money {{in a series of}} ill-advised {{investments}} — including, to the merriment of the Dutch press, a pig farm — that were counseled by a scam artist who had possibly seduced his wife, Cruyff and his family came to the United States. As he recalled, “I had lost millions in pig-farming and that was the reason I decided to become a footballer again.” Cruyff insisted that his decision to resume his playing career in the United States was pivotal in his career. “It was wrong, a mistake, to quit playing at 31 with the unique talent I possessed,” and adding that “Starting from zero in America, many miles away from my past, {{was one of the best}} decisions I made. There I learned how to develop my uncontrolled ambitions, to <b>think</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> coach and about sponsorship.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The work {{of record}} {{producer}} Phil Spector, who popularized the Wall of Sound, was a focal obsession for Wilson. In the 1960s, Wilson thought of Spector as [...] "the single most influential producer. He's timeless. He makes a milestone whenever {{he goes into}} the studio." [...] Brian later reflected: [...] "I was unable to really <b>think</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spector's work. That was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song." [...] He explains: [...] "Before Spector, people recorded all the instruments separately. They got great piano, great guitar, and great bass. But he thought of the song as one giant instrument. It was huge. Size was so important to him, how big everything sounded. And he had the best drums I ever heard." [...] In 1999, when asked if he was a religious man, Wilson responded: [...] "I believe in Phil Spector." ...|$|E

Critic Michael Hann cites an [...] "extraordinary rush of avant-pop creativity between 1965 and 1967". In the belief of writer Richard Goldstein: [...] " [...] never realized his full potential as a composer. In the light of electronica and minimalism, you can see how advanced his ideas were, but they remain bursts of inspiration from a mind that couldn't mobilize itself into a whole. This was the major tragedy of rock in the sixties." ...|$|E
