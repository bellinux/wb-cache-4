50|$|On September 22, 2010 it {{was decided}} to build a tunnel version (3,05 billion euro) of the BAM-route. The {{additional}} cost (352 million more than the cost of the ‘flyover version’) is to be met by the City of Antwerp and the Port. It was also confirmed that an underground A102 (700 million to 1 billion) is to be constructed, but only after the BAM-route has been completed. In addition, the final negotiations have resulted in a decision to construct a tunnel version of the current R11road (425 to 530 million euro), connecting the E313 and the E19 highway, after 2021. The global cost of Oosterweel connection, A102 and R11 is calculated at 4,2 billion to 4,6 billion euro. Existing plans to enlarge the entire R1, as proposed in the Antwerp Master plan since 2004, would become obsolete after the construction of both <b>tangent</b> <b>roads</b> east of the city, and have been scrapped accordingly.|$|R

5000|$|The {{western end}} of Parnell Street has been {{substantially}} redeveloped in recent years. The urban regeneration came after road plans by Dublin Corporation devastated {{the street in the}} 1970s, when it was scheduled {{to be part of the}} Inner <b>Tangent</b> <b>Road</b> scheme, causing massive dereliction and blight. Virtually all of the original Georgian architecture was destroyed and subsequently replaced by buildings of much larger scale. The eastern end of Parnell Street, having remained comparatively undeveloped, is now home to a thriving immigrant community.

50|$|The {{single-track}} train route leaves Nürnberg Hauptbahnhof to the west, running first {{past the}} outer {{grounds of the}} Nuremberg Transport Museum. From the bridge over Steinbühler Tunnel (a street under Nürnberg-Steinbühl station) the line goes onto the 604 metre-long flyover over the lines to Bamberg and to Crailsheim, {{as well as an}} elongated left turn over the Frankenschnellweg autobahn. At the beginning of the structure is Nürnberg-Steinbühl station, which provides interchange with the urban tram network. The line then runs with the districts of Schweinau to the west and Sandreuth to the east and crosses the south ring (federal highway B 4 R) over a bridge, on which Nürnberg-Sandreuth station is located. The line runs under the line that formerly connected the Nuremberg marshalling yard and the former Nuremberg main goods yard and the ring railway and then crosses over the parallel Southwest <b>Tangent</b> <b>road</b> and the Main-Danube Canal.|$|E
5000|$|Trains leave Gera Süd {{station on}} a two-track railway and passed under the {{southeast}} <b>tangent</b> <b>road</b> to a junction, {{where the line}} to Saalfeld runs {{to the south and}} the line to Gößnitz branches off to the east. The now closed section of the Elster Valley Railway branched off to the southeast and passed to the east of the district of Zwötzen and crossed the White Elster to the west of Liebschwitz and came within a few metres of the Saalfeld line in the area of today's Wolfsgefärth junction, where the current Elster Valley Railway starts. The decommissioned Weida-Wünschendorf-Werdau railway crosses the Elster Valley Railway near the Wünschendorf dolomite works and the two lines converge at Wünschendorf station. Both lines leave the town and the Wünschendorf basin in parallel and reach the narrow and densely wooded valley of the Elster, with the Elster Valley Railway changing to the western river bank. After passing the quartzite quarry, the Werdau-Mehltheuer railway curves eastwards into the Fuchsbach valley, while the Elster Valley Railway runs through a tunnel {{for the first time and}} crosses the river again. In Berga, it crosses federal highway 175 and south of the town it first crosses alluvial farmland, until the river is crosses again and the 264 metre-long Rüßdorf Tunnel shortens the route. From Lehnamühle the route runs through the Greiz-Werdauer Wald landscape as far as Neumühle station and to a double crossing of the river to Neumühle Tunnel. On the way to Greiz, the river is crossed twice, and this section has one of the most noteworthy works of civil engineering—as shown by its popularity with photographers—the Schlossberg Tunnel under the Oberes Schloss (Upper Palace) in Greiz. On the second half of the route, the White Elster is crossed a total of fourteen times and it parallels Bundesstraße 92 closely as far as Elsterberg. At the exit from Greiz station, the disused line to Neumark branched off to the east and at the same time the line passes under old steel bridge of the Tannendorfstraße. After the confluence of the Göltzsch with the White Elster, the line crosses the Elster twice and runs through the Dölau (or Rothenthal) tunnel, before reaching Greiz-Dölau station. Between Greiz-Dölau and Elsterberg, the line remains on the eastern bank of the Elster and crosses the state border into Saxony, before crossing the river a total of six times and through two tunnel on the subsequent section to Barthmühle. Among the most striking points on the line is the following section under the Elster Viaduct, which carried the Leipzig-Hof railway. Immediately afterwards the line runs to the confluence of the Trieb and passes the Pöhl dam, which lies 800 metre to the east. The Barthmühle tunnel as well as four other Elster bridges follow until it reaches the industrial city of Plauen with its stations of Chrieschwitz, Mitte, Unterer Bahnhof and Zellwolle, although only the new Mitte station is now served. After leaving the city, the line is approached from the north by the Plauen-Cheb railway, which finally meets the Elster Valley Railway in Kürbitz and the lines run parallel for the remaining two kilometres to Weischlitz.|$|E

In the example given above, a long tangent followed by a sharp curve would be acceptable if a 30 mph design speed was chosen. Design consistency analysis would flag the decrease in operating speed at the curve.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{interest}} in highway automation and current advances in real-time image processing provide a suitable testbed for employing the visual information extracted from image sequences in the feedback loop {{of the control}} system.

40|$|Many {{studies on}} driver speed {{behavior}} {{are found in}} the scientific literature today, and various researchers have addressed roadway alignment consistency for travel safety in the context of current operating speeds. An experimental analysis of low-volume roads without spiral transition curves between geometric tangent and circular elements on the horizontal alignment was conducted in southern Italy. All selected roadways are located in areas with level terrain and vertical grades of less than 6 %. This study is a continuation of a 2009 research project that developed procedures to predict speed factors for horizontal curves and <b>tangents</b> on low-volume <b>roads.</b> The present research focuses on the design of continuous operating speed profiles that reproduce real driver speed behavior at each section of the horizontal alignment with variables that now include the pavement deterioration condition. Four new regression equations were developed to predict the operating speed on tangent and circular curve elements by using speed factors and geometric variables. These models were developed by a traditional ordinary least-squares method involving speed values not surveyed in transition zones. The aim of this refined study is to illustrate the roadway factors influencing optimal and safe driving performance...|$|R

40|$|Ethiopia {{has one of}} Africa’s {{fastest growing}} non-oil {{producing}} economies and an increasing level of motorisation (AfDB, OECD, UNDP, & UNECA, 2012). This rapidly increasing mobility has created some unique road safety concerns; however there is scant published information and related commentary (United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, 2009). The objective {{of this paper is}} to quantify police-reported traffic crashes in Ethiopia and characterise the existing state of road safety. Six years (July 2005 - June 2011) of police-reported crash data were analysed, consisting of 12, 140 fatal and 29, 454 injury crashes on the country’s road network. The 12, 140 fatal crashes involved 1, 070 drivers, 5, 702 passengers, and 7, 770 pedestrians, totalling 14, 542 fatalities, an average of 1. 2 road user fatalities per crash. An important and glaring trend that emerges is that more than half of the fatalities in Ethiopia involve pedestrians. The majority of the crashes occur during daytime hours, involve males, and involve persons in the 18 - 50 age group—Ethiopia’s active workforce. Crashes frequently occur in mid blocks or roadways. The predominant collision between motor vehicles and pedestrians was a rollover on a <b>road</b> <b>tangent</b> section. Failing to observe the priority of pedestrians and speeding were the major causes of crashes attributed by police. Trucks and minibus taxis were involved in the majority of crashes, while automobiles (small vehicles) were less involved in crashes relative to other vehicle types, partially because small vehicles tend to be driven fewer kilometres per annum. These data illustrate and justify a high priority to identify and implement effective programs, policies, and countermeasures focused on reducing pedestrian crashes...|$|R
40|$|This nal report {{describes}} {{the application of}} computer vision techniques to the lateral and longitudinal control of an autonomous highway vehicle. In {{the part of the}} project we focused on an analysis of the vehicle's lateral dynamics and the design of an appropriate controller for lateral control and investigated various static feedback strategies where the measurements obtained from vision, namely o set from the centerline and angle between the <b>road</b> <b>tangent</b> and the orientation of the vehicle at some look-ahead distance, are directly used for control. The role of the look-ahead, its relation to the vision processing delay, longitudinal velocity and road geometry was crucial on the design of the control and their experimental evaluation. We carried out a thorough analysis of the e ects of changing various important system parameters like the vehicle velocity, thelookahead range of the vision sensor and the processing delay associated with the perception and control systems. We also present the results of a series of experiments that were designed to provide a systematic comparison of a number of control strategies. The control strategies that were explored include a lead-lag control law, a full- state linear controller and input-output linearizing control law. Each of these control strategies was implemented and tested at highway speeds on our experimental vehicle platform, a Honda Accord LX sedan. For the longitudinal control problem, we investigated the possibility of using stereo vision to provide the range information, in conjunction with a scanning laser radar sensor. The vision based tracking system utilizes a layered architecture wherein the bottom layer computes motion in both images using a simple correlation algorithm, and the upper level performs stereo xation and reconstruction using an algorithm designed for active vision systems. We present some initial results comparing the quality of range measurements provided by a vision system with the laser radar system. We report the results from the experimental demonstration of the system as part of the National Automated Highway Systems Consortium (NAHSC) Demonstration which took place in August 1997 in San Diego. The overall system was demonstrated {{as a part of the}} main highway scenario as well as part of a small public demonstration of the vision based lateral control on a highly curved test track.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that crashes on {{horizontal}} curves are a cause for concern in all countries due to the frequency and severity of crashes at curves compared to <b>road</b> <b>tangents.</b> A recent study of crashes in western Sweden reported a higher rate of crashes in right curves than left curves. To further understand this result, this paper reports the results of novel analyses of the responses of vehicles and drivers during negotiating and overtaking maneuvers on curves for right hand traffic. The overall objectives of the study were to find road parameters for curves that affect vehicle dynamic responses, to analyze these responses during overtaking maneuvers on curves, and to link the results with driver behavior for different curve directions. The studied road features were speed, super-elevation, radius and friction including their interactions, while the analyzed vehicle dynamic factors were lateral acceleration and yaw angular velocity. A simulation program, PC-Crash, has been used to simulate road parameters and vehicle response interaction in curves. Overtaking maneuvers have been simulated for all road feature combinations in a total of 108 runs. Analysis of variances (ANOVA) was performed, using two sided randomized block design, to find differences in vehicle responses for the curve parameters. To study driver response, a field test using an instrumented vehicle and 32 participants was reviewed as it contained longitudinal speed and acceleration data for analysis. The simulation results showed that road features affect overtaking performance in right and left curves differently. Overtaking on right curves was sensitive to radius and the interaction of radius with road condition; while overtaking on left curves was more sensitive to super-elevation. Comparisons of lateral acceleration and yaw angular velocity during these maneuvers showed different vehicle response configurations depending on curve direction and maneuver path. The field test experiments also showed that drivers behave differently depending on the curve direction where both speed and acceleration were higher on right than left curves. The implication {{of this study is that}} curve direction should be taken into consideration to a greater extent when designing and redesigning curves. It appears that the driver and the vehicle are influenced by different infrastructure factors depending on the curve direction. In addition, the results suggest that the vehicle dynamics response alone cannot explain the higher crash risk in right curves. Further studies of the links between driver, vehicle, and highway characteristics are needed, such as naturalistic driving studies, to identify the key safety indicators for highway safety...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{extensive}} {{research has been}} carried out on autonomous vehicle system. A completely autonomous vehicle is one in which a computer performs all the tasks that the human driver normally would. However, this study only focuses on driving control system that based on vision sensor. Therefore, this study presents a simulation system with Graphical User Interface (GUI) to simulate and analyse the driving control for autonomous vehicle that based on video taken from the vehicle during driving on highway, by using MATLAB programming. The GUI gives easy access to analyse video, image and vehicle dynamics. Once the GUI application for simulation is launched, user can enter input parameters value (number of frames, canny edge detection value, vehicle speed, and braking time) in text control to simulate and analyse video images and vehicle driving control. In this study, there are four subsystems in the system development process. The first subsystem is sensor. This study was used a single GrandVision Mini Digital Video as sensor. This video camera provides the information of Selangor's highway environment by recording highway scene in front of the vehicle during driving. Then, the recorded video is process in second subsystem or named as imageprocessing subsystem. In this subsystem, image-capturing techniques capture the video images frame by frame. After that, lane detection process extracts the information about vehicle position with respect to the highway lane. The results are angle between the <b>road</b> <b>tangent</b> and orientation of the vehicle at some look-ahead distance. Driving controller in the controller subsystem that is the third subsystem used the resulted angle from lane detection process along with vehicle dynamics parameters to determine the vehicle-driving angle and vehicle dynamics performance. In this study, designing a vehicle controller requires a model of vehicle's behaviour whether dynamics or kinematics. Therefore, in vehicle subsystem that is the fourth subsystem, this study used vehicle's dynamics behaviour as the vehicle model. The model has six degrees of freedom (DOF) and several factors such as the vehicle weight, centre of gravity, and cornering stiffness were taken into account of dynamics modelling. The important contribution of this study is the development of vehicle lane detection and tracking algorithm based on colour cue segmentation, Canny edge detection and Hough transform. The algorithm gave good result in detecting straight and smooth curvature lane on highway even when the lane was affected by shadow. In this study, all the methods have been tested on video data and the experimental results have demonstrated a fast and robust system...|$|R
