25|$|Although it {{has been}} {{recognised}} that foreign workers are crucial to the country's economy, the government is considering capping these workers, as foreign workers make up 80% of the construction industry and up to 50% of the service industry. To keep an effective <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue of immigration and to also attract foreign talents at the same time, the Ministry of Manpower (MoM) issues employment pass under three categories viz: P1 Employment Pass for those individuals with monthly earning of $8,000 and up, P2 Employment Pass for individuals with monthly earning of $4,500–7,999 and Q1 Employment Pass individuals {{with at least a}} monthly earning of $3,000.|$|E
25|$|As a cost {{reduction}} measure, especially in high-volume consumer receivers, all the tube heaters could be connected in series across the AC supply using heaters requiring the same current {{and with a}} similar warm-up time. In one such design, a <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tube heater string supplied the 6 volts needed for the dial light. By deriving the high voltage from a half-wave rectifier directly connected to the AC mains, the heavy and costly power transformer was eliminated. This also allowed such receivers to operate on direct current, a so-called AC/DC receiver design. Many different US consumer AM radio manufacturers of the era used a virtually identical circuit, given the nickname All American Five.|$|E

25|$|Promotion {{of healthy}} sucking reflex: By using a pacifier-activated lullaby device, music {{therapists}} can help promote stronger sucking reflexes, while also reducing pain perception for the infant. The Gato Box {{is a small}} rectangular instrument that stimulates a prenatal heartbeat sound in a soft and rhythmic manner that has also been effective in aiding sucking behaviours. The music therapist uses their fingers to <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drum, rather than using a mallet. The rhythm supports movement when feeding and promotes healthy sucking patterns. By improving sucking patterns, babies are able to coordinate the important dual mechanisms of breathing, sucking and swallowing needed to feed, thus promoting growth and weight gain. When this treatment proves effective, infants are able to leave the hospital earlier.|$|E
25|$|Males {{may also}} use more {{indirect}} techniques {{to mate with}} females, such as intimidation. While most female water striders (Gerridae) have their genitalia exposed, females of the water strider species Gerris gracilicornis have evolved a shield over their genitals. As a result, males cannot physically coerce females because mating is difficult unless the female exposes her genitalia. Therefore, males intimidate females into mating by attracting predators; they <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water’s surface and create ripples that catch the attention of predatory fish. From there, {{it is in the}} best interest of the female to mate, and as quickly as possible, to avoid being eaten by predators. Typical mating positions of water striders have the females on the bottom, closer to predators, so the risk of predation is much higher for them. Females succumb to copulation to get males to cease signaling to predators.|$|E
25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E

500|$|The {{incident}} was widely reported and condemned by the Soviet press. Kharlamov himself believed that [...] "Bobby Clarke {{was given the}} job of taking {{me out of the}} game." [...] The slash was apparently done at the instigation of assistant coach John Ferguson. [...] "I remember that Kharlamov's ankle was hurting pretty bad. I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it." [...] Canadian journalist Dick Beddoes asked Clarke about it later at a team reunion, calling it a [...] "wicked two-hander", to which Clarke replied [...] "Dick, if I hadn't learned how to lay on a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left Flin Flon." ...|$|E

Alan Sherman said, [...] "My jaw dropped", while Art Sherman joked, [...] "I'm glad I'm training at Los Alamitos, because he looked like a 350 [...] horse coming out of the gate"; a reference to Quarter Horse racing sprint distances. Espinoza remarked, [...] "I wanted to let him enjoy his race," [...] later adding, [...] "I wanted to see if he [...] go wire to wire... that was the day I found out how much he loves to run." [...] The San Felipe was California Chrome's first win in a race open to all three-year-olds, not just California-breds, and earned him 50 points in the Road to the Kentucky Derby system.|$|E

[...] Blumlein discovered that if the tap was {{placed at a distance}} 15–20% down from the supply end of the output transformer, the tube or valve would combine the positive features of both the triode and the pentode design.|$|E

2500|$|Aye-ayes <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{trunks and}} {{branches}} of trees {{at a rate}} of up to eight times per second, and listen to the echo produced to find hollow chambers. Studies have suggested that the acoustic properties associated with the foraging cavity have no effect on excavation behavior. Once a chamber is found, they chew a hole into the wood and get grubs out of that hole with their highly adapted narrow and bony middle fingers. The aye-aye begins foraging between 30 minutes before and three hours after sunset. Up to 80% of the night is spent foraging in the canopy, separated by occasional rest periods. It climbs trees by making successive vertical leaps, much like a squirrel. Horizontal movement is more difficult, but the aye-aye rarely descends to jump to another tree, and can often travel up to [...] a night.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the sixth}} {{game of the}} series, Bobby Clarke slashed Kharlamov intentionally, {{fracturing}} a bone in his ankle. He would miss the seventh game of the series, {{and returned to the}} lineup for the final game of the series, but at much reduced effectiveness. At the time, many felt the slash was intentional. Assistant coach John Ferguson would later say [...] "I called (Bobby) Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ankle'." [...] As for Kharlamov himself, he had little doubt that an attempt had been made to limit his effectiveness, [...] "I'm convinced that Bobby Clarke was given the job of taking me out of the game." [...] Kharlamov's injury, and his diminished play in the aftermath have been regarded as a turning point for the series in Canada's favour, who won the series in the eighth and final game.|$|E
