5|$|A February 2000 {{story about}} organic {{vegetables}} on 20/20 included statements by Stossel that tests {{had shown that}} neither organic nor conventional produce samples contained any pesticide residue, and that organic food {{was more likely to}} be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. The Environmental Working Group objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's statement that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in The New York Times confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that he had thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that <b>the</b> <b>gist</b> of his report had been accurate.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} Wiśniowiecki also {{engaged in a}} {{political}} conflict over nobility titles, in particular, the title of prince (kniaź). The nobility in the Commonwealth was officially equal, and used different and non-hereditary titles than those found in {{rest of the world}} (see officials of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth); <b>the</b> <b>gist</b> of the conflict, which took much of the Sejm's time around 1638–41, revolved around whether old prince titles (awarded to families before their lands were incorporated into the Commonwealth in the 1569 Union of Lublin), and the new titles, awarded more recently by some foreign courts, should be recognized. Wiśniowiecki was one of the chief participants in this debate, successfully defending the old titles, including that of his own family, and succeeding in abolishing the new titles, which gained him the enmity of another powerful magnate, Jerzy Ossoliński. Other than this conflict, in his years as a deputy (1635–46), Jeremi wasn't involved in any major political issues, and only twice (in 1640 and 1642) he served in the minor function of a commissar for investigating the eastern and southern border disputes.|$|E

40|$|The Carney triad (CT) is {{gastrointestinal}} stromal tumor (GIST), paraganglioma, and pulmonary chondroma. <b>The</b> <b>GISTs</b> of CT show different clinical, molecular, and morphologic {{features to}} usual adult GISTs but {{are similar to}} the majority of pediatric GISTs. We postulated that these GISTs would show negative staining for succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB). We performed SDHB immunohistochemistry on GISTs arising in 5 individuals with CT, 1 child, 7 individuals with GIST in young adulthood including 2 with germline KIT mutations, 3 individuals with neurofibromatosis 1, one 63 -year-old female with multifocal gastric epithelioid GIST with lymph node metastases, and 104 consecutive unselected individuals with apparently sporadic <b>GIST.</b> <b>The</b> <b>GISTs</b> and paragangliomas arising in CT, <b>the</b> pediatric <b>GIST,</b> and <b>the</b> multifocal gastric <b>GIST</b> from <b>the</b> 63 -year-old showed negative SDHB staining. <b>GISTs</b> from <b>the</b> 7 young adults and 3 with neurofibromatosis were SDHB positive. Of <b>the</b> unselected <b>GISTs,</b> 101 (97 %) were positive. One of <b>the</b> negative <b>GISTs</b> arose in a 48 -year-old female with previous recurrent multifocal gastric <b>GISTs</b> and <b>the</b> other 2 arose in females also in their 40 s with gastric GISTs with epithelioid morphology. We conclude that negative staining for SDHB is characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>GISTs</b> of CT and the subgroup of pediatric GISTs which it resembles. Furthermore, when negative staining occurs in apparently sporadic <b>GISTs</b> in adults, <b>the</b> <b>GISTs</b> show morphologic and clinical features similar to pediatric and CT type GISTs. GISTs may therefore be divided into type 1 (SDHB positive) and type 2 (SDHB negative) subtypes...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the ultrasonography (EUS) features of gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) {{as compared with}} gastric leiomyomas and then to determine the EUS features that could predict malignant GISTs. METHODS: We evaluated the endoscopic EUS features in 53 patients with gastric mesenchymal tumors confirmed by histopathologic diagnosis. <b>The</b> <b>GISTs</b> were classified into benign and malignant groups according to the histological risk classification. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated 7 leiomyomas and 46 GISTs. Inhomogenicity, hyperechogenic spots, a marginal halo and higher echogenicity {{as compared with the}} surrounding muscle layer appeared more frequently in <b>the</b> <b>GISTs</b> than in <b>the</b> leiomyomas (P < 0. 05). The presence of at least two of these four features had a sensitivity of 89. 1 % and a specificity of 85. 7 % for predicting GISTs. Except for tumor size and irregularity of the border, most of the EUS features were not helpful for predicting the malignant potential of GISTs. On multivariate analysis, only the maximal diameter of <b>the</b> <b>GISTs</b> was an independent predictor. The optimal size for predicting malignant GISTs was 35 mm. The sensitivity and specificity using this value were 92. 3 % and 78. 8 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: EUS may help to differentiate gastric GISTs from gastric leiomyomas. Once GISTs are suspected, surgery should be considered if the size is greater than 3. 5 cm...|$|R

40|$|Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (<b>GISTs)</b> are <b>the</b> {{most common}} mesenchymal tumors in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract (GIT). Although interstitial cells of Cajal {{has been suggested}} as origin of this tumor, the cytological and ultrastructural features of GISTs are heterogeneous and unclear. A total 10 cases of normal gastrointestinal tissue (control), 13 <b>GISTs</b> of <b>the</b> stomach (8), small intestine (3), mesocolon (1) and liver (1), and 2 gastrointestinal autonomic nervous tumor (GANT) of small intestine were ultrastructurally studied. Normal interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) were abundantly present around the myenteric plexuses or individually scattered through the wall of GIT. ICC was characterized by slender cytoplasmic processes, well-developed endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, caveolae and intermediate filaments. <b>The</b> <b>GISTs</b> and GANTs had overlapping ultrastructures. The most common and important ultrastructural features of GISTs were rich villous cytoplasmic processes, dispersed intermediate filaments and abundant SER, and those of GANTs were neurosecretory granules and skenoid fibers. Compared with ICC, <b>the</b> <b>GISTs</b> and GANTs had remarkably reduced caveolae and gap junctions.

25|$|Recall {{memory is}} linked with {{instincts}} and mechanisms {{in order to}} remember how an event happened to learn from it or avoid the agitator, connections are made with emotions. For instance, if a speaker is very calm and neutral, the effectiveness of encoding memory is very low and listeners get <b>the</b> <b>gist</b> of what the speaker is discussing.

This is full access of the fight or flight mechanism all people have functioning in the brain, but based on what triggers this mechanism will lead to better recall of it. People tend to focus their attention on cues that are loud, very soft, or something unusual.

40|$|Abstract Background Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (<b>GIST)</b> {{represent}} <b>the</b> {{most common}} mesenchymal {{tumors of the}} digestive tract. Over {{the last ten years}} <b>the</b> management of <b>GISTs</b> has dramatically altered but their coexistence with other gasrointesinal tumors of different histogenesis presents a special interest. <b>The</b> coexistence of <b>GISTs</b> with other primaries is usually discovered incidentally during GI surgery for carcinomas. Case presentation We present here, a case of a 66 -year-old patient with intestinal GIST and a synchronous colorectal adenocarcinoma discovered incidentally during surgical treatment of <b>the</b> recurrent <b>GIST.</b> Immunohistochemical examination revealed the concurrence of histologically proved GIST (strongly positive staining for c-kit, vimentin, SMA, and focal positive in S- 100, while CD- 34 was negative) and Dukes Stage C, (T 3, N 3, M 0 according the TNM staging classification of colorectal cancer). Conclusion <b>The</b> coexistence of <b>GIST</b> with either synchronous or metachronous colorectal cancer represents a phenomenon with increasing number of relative reports in the literature the last 5 years. In any case of <b>GIST</b> <b>the</b> surgeon should be alert to recognize a possible coexistent tumor with different histological origin and to perform a thorough preoperative and intraoperative control.
