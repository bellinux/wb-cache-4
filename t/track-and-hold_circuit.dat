Hence, the instrument works, by using PLO, even when external clocks are unavailable. The ADC module has a <b>track-and-hold</b> <b>circuit</b> (HMC 661 LC 4 B) that accepts microwave input and a 10 -bit ADC (EV 10 AQ 190 A), which realizes a maximum sampling speed of 5  GS/s by interleaving four 1.25  GS/s ADC cores with a typical effective number of bits (ENOB) of 8 bit. The <b>track-and-hold</b> <b>circuit</b> is implemented {{in front of the}} ADC, and it converts the single-ended input signal to a differential signal. A phase shifter is also implemented to connect the <b>track-and-hold</b> <b>circuit</b> and ADC in order to adjust the phases between the two components. Consequently, the spectrometer realizes direct sampling spectroscopy from 0 to 8  GHz although the ADC of OCTAD-S does not have a good response in the microwave range (see the next section). The DSP module has a FPGA chip, Xilinx Virtex- 7 (XC 7 VX 485 T), which has 485, 760 logic cells. The interface part of this instrument transfers the processed data, which are power spectra for the spectrometers, to external media.

The front panel of this instrument contains some LEDs that are used to check the conditions of the instrument. For example, we can check the conditions of the external clock or the overflow of the ADCs. There is also a liquid-crystal display in the front panel that shows the typical ADC count levels in real time.|$|E

40|$|The {{emerging}} nanowire {{technology in}} recent years has attracted an increasing interest for high-speed, low-power electronics due to the possibility of a gate-all-around (GAA) geometry enabling aggressive gate length scaling, together with the ease in incorporating high-mobility narrow band gap III-V semiconductors such as InAs on Si substrates. These benefits make vertical nanowire transistors an attractive alternative to the planar devices. However, huge challenges are also encountered. Apart from the large parasitics associated with the device layout, vertical III-V/high-k nanowire MOSFETs so far are also suffering from a less efficient gate control partially due to the defect states existing in the MOS gate stack. Besides the narrow band gap InAs may result in impact-ionization and band-to-band tunneling at high drain voltages, influencing both the power efficiency and speed of modern integrated circuits (ICs). In this thesis, results on planar InAs/high-k MOS gate stacks investigated in detail using both the capacitance-voltage (C-V) and the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques are first presented (Paper I and II). The origin of the specific trap state energy distribution is clarified and compared to the well studied InGaAs and GaAs materials. The results highlight the benefit of using InAs, with optimized high-k deposition strategies, as the n-MOSFET channel. The second focus of the thesis is the improvement of vertical GAA nanowire MOS gate stacks (Paper III and IV). By developing the fabrication scheme and design, conventional C-V technique is successfully applied to extract detailed trap state distributions. A low interface trap state density (Dit) below 10 E 12 eV- 1 cm- 2 near the MOS semiconductor conduction band edge is achieved. Furthermore, RF C-V measurements, together with the development of a complete small signal equivalent circuit model, for vertical GAA nanowire MOS systems are also presented for the first time, which enables characterizations of border trap density, interface trap density, channel resistivity and quality factor of the nanowire MOSFETs simultaneously. The third focus is the development of a device structure to reduce detrimental impact-ionization and band-to-band tunneling due to the narrow band gap of InAs (Paper V and VI). An asymmetric InAs/InGaAs vertical nanowire MOSFET with a large band gap drain region is proposed, taking advantage of the efficient strain relaxation of nanowire epitaxial growth. Control of the InGaAs nanowire composition has been successfully demonstrated.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 High-accuracy and {{high-speed}} CMOS track-and-hold (T/H) or sample-and-hold (S/H) circuits are {{an important}} part of the analog-to-digital interface. The switched-capacitor (SC) circuits usually contain one or more op-amps whose dc offset, finite gain, finite bandwidth have a big impact on the accuracy of the <b>track-and-hold</b> <b>circuit.</b> Basic correlated double sampling (CDS) scheme can reduce such effects, but the compensation that it provides may not be good enough for high-accuracy application.

The predictive operation results in more correlation between the unwanted signal and the signal that is subtracted during the double sampling, and hence can achieve offset and gain compensation over wider frequency range.

40|$|Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) {{serve as}} the {{interfaces}} between the analog natural world and the binary world of computer data. Due to this essential role, ADC circuits have been well studied over 40 years, and many problems associated with them have already been solved. However in recent years, a new species of ADCs has appeared, and since then attracted lots of attention. These are ultra-high-speed (often greater than 40 GS/s) time-interleaved ADCs of low or medium resolution (around 6 to 8 bit) built in CMOS processes. Although such ADCs {{can be used in}} high-speed electronic measurement equipment and radar systems, the recent driving force behind them is next generation 100 Gbps/ 400 Gbps fiber optical transceivers. These transceivers take advantage of ultra-high-speed ADCs and digital-signal-processors (DSPs) to enable ultra-high data-rate communications in long-haul networks (city-to-city, transcontinental, and transoceanic fiber links), metro networks (fibers that connect enterprises in metropolitan areas), and data centers (fiber links within data center infrastructures). At such high sampling rate, massively time-interleaved successive-approximation ADC (SAR ADC) architecture has emerged as the dominant solution due to its excellent power efficiency. Several recent works has demonstrated success in achieving high sampling rate. However, the sampling network has become the bottleneck that limits the input bandwidth in these ADCs. It is apparent that conventional switch-based <b>track-and-hold</b> (T&H) <b>circuit</b> cannot satisfy the > 20 GHz bandwidth requirement. In addition, it is unclear what the optimal interleaving configuration is. Each state-of-the-art design adopts a different interleaving configuration – from straightforward conventional 1 -rank interleaving to 2 -rank hierarchical sampling or even 3 ranks. How to partition interleaving factors among different ranks has not yet been investigated. Furthermore, asynchronous SAR sub-ADCs are often used in these designs to push the sampling rate even further. The well-known sparkle-code issues caused by comparator meta-stability in asynchronous SARs can significantly increase the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) of the transceivers unless power hungry error correction coding are implemented in the system. Although many works in the literature attempted to deal with the meta-stability in asynchronous SARs, the effectiveness of these approaches have not been fully demonstrated. In this thesis, I will first propose a new cascode-based T&H circuits to improve the ADC bandwidth beyond the limit of conventional switch-based T&H circuits. Then, a system design and optimization methodology of hierarchical time-interleaved sampling network is presented in the context of cascode T&H. To deal with sparkle-code issue in asynchronous SAR sub-ADCs, a new back-end meta-stability correction technique is employed. An extensive statistical analysis is provided to verify the correction algorithm can greatly reduce sparkle-code error-rates. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed circuits and techniques, two prototype ADCs have been implemented. The first 7 b 12. 5 GS/s hierarchically time-interleaved ADC in 65 nm CMOS process demonstrates 29. 4 dB SNDR and > 25 GHz bandwidth. The later 6 b 46 GS/s ADC in 28 nm CMOS employs asynchronous SAR sub-ADC design with back-end meta-stability correction. The measurement results show it achieves sparkle-code error free operation over 1 e 10 samples in addition to achieving > 23 GHz bandwidth and 25. 2 dB SNDR.

The quality of A/D and D/A conversions deeply affects what we see and what we hear in the real world video and radio. This dissertation deals with high-speed ADCs: a 5 -bit 500 -MSPS ADC and an 8 -bit 2 -GSPS ADC. These units can be applied in flat panel display, image enhancement and in high-speed data link. To achieve the state-of-the-art performance, we employed a 0. 13 -μm/ 2. 5 -V 210 -GHz (unity-gain frequency) BiCMOS SiGe process for all the implementations. The circuit building blocks, such as the <b>Track-and-Hold</b> <b>circuit</b> (T/H) and the comparator, required by an ADC not only benefit from SiGe's superior ultra-high frequency properties but also by its power drive capability. The T/H described here achieved a dynamic performance of 8 -bit accuracy at 2 -GHz Nyquist rate with an input full scale range of 1 Vp-p. The T/H consumed 13 mW of power. The unique 4 -in/ 2 -out comparator was made of fully differential emitter couple pairs in order to operate at such a high frequency. Cascaded cross-coupled amplifier core was employed to reduce Miller effect and to avoid collector-emitter breakdown of the HBTs. We utilized the comparator interpolation technique between the preamplifer stages and the latches to reduce the total power dissipated by the comparator array. In addition, we developed an innovative D/A conversion and analog subtraction approach necessary for two-step conversion by using a bipolar pre-distortion technique. This innovation enabled us to decrease the design complexity in the subranging process of a two-step ADC.

First, the time-interleaved architecture is required in order to achieve over 10 GS/s sampling rate, with the trade-off of the number of the channels and the sampling rate in each channel. Phase misalignment and channel mismatch must be considered too. Second, timing accuracy, especially dynamic jitter of sampling clock becomes a major concern at ultra-high frequency, and certain techniques must be taken to address it. Finally, to achieve low power consumption, Flash architecture is not suitable to serve as the sub-ADC, and a low-power sub-ADC that can work at relatively high speed need to be designed. A single channel, asynchronous successive approximation (SA) ADC with improved feedback delay has been fabricated in 40 nm CMOS. Compared with a conventional SA structure that employs a single quantizer controlled by a digital feedback logic loop, the proposed SA-ADC employs multiple quantizers for each conversion bit, clocked by an asynchronous ripple clock that is generated after each quantization. Hence, the sampling rate of the 6 -bit ADC is limited only by the six delays of the Capacitive-DAC settling and each comparator’s quantization delay, as the digital logic delay is eliminated. Measurement results of the 40 nm-CMOS SA-ADC achieves peak SNDR of 32. 9 dB at 1 GS/s and 30. 5 dB at 1. 25 GS/s, consuming 5. 28 mW and 6. 08 mW respectively, leading to FoM of 148 fJ/conversion-step and 178 fJ/conversion-step, in a core area less than 170 µm by 85 µm. Based on the previous work of sub-ADC, a 12 -GS/s 5 -b 50 -mW ADC is designed in 40 nm CMOS with 8 time-interleaved channels of Flash-SA hybrid structure each running at 1. 5 GS/s. A modified bootstrapped switch is used in the <b>track-and-hold</b> <b>circuit,</b> introducing a global clock signal to synchronize the sampling instants of each individual channel, therefore improve the phase alignment and reduce distortion. The global clock is provided by a CML buffer which is injected by off-chip low-noise sine-wave signal, so that the RMS dynamic jitter is low for better ENOB performance. Measurement results show that the 12 GS/s ADC can achieve a SNDR of 25. 8 dB with the input signal frequency around DC and 22. 8 dB around 2 GHz, consuming 32. 1 mW, leading to FoM of 237. 3 fJ/conversion-step, in a core area less than 800 µm by 500 µm...|$|E
