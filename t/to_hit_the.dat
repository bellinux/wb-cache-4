5|$|Hurricane Isidore {{was one of}} {{only four}} storms <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> north side of the Yucatán since records have been kept. It was the first {{tropical}} cyclone <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> area since Tropical Depression Greta in 1970, the first tropical storm since 1935, the first hurricane since 1888, and only major hurricane to ever hit the area.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane David was {{originally}} going <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> south {{coast of the}} United States Territory of Puerto Rico, but a change in course {{in the middle of}} the night spared it the damage that the Dominican Republic suffered.|$|E
5|$|In 1624, a {{fatality}} occurred {{following a}} match on Saturday, 28 August, at Horsted Keynes, now in East Sussex. A fielder called Jasper Vinall was struck {{on the head}} by the batsman, Edward Tye, who was trying <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball a second time to avoid being caught. Vinall, who died thirteen days later at home in West Hoathly, is thus the earliest recorded cricketing fatality. The matter was recorded in a coroner's court, which returned a verdict of death by misadventure. The tragedy was repeated in 1647 when another fatality was recorded at Selsey, now in West Sussex, a player called Henry Brand being hit on {{the head by a}} batsman trying <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball a second time. When the first Laws of Cricket were encoded in 1744, it was illegal <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball twice and a batsman breaking the rule was to be given out. The record of the 1624 case confirms that two villages, Horsted Keynes and West Hoathly, were involved in the match and provides further evidence of the growth of village cricket.|$|E

5|$|A focal {{mechanism}} {{solution of}} the earthquake confirmed two nodal planes both striking north-south and dipping approximately 45degrees {{to the east and}} to the west. This faulting suggests dip slip reverse motion, and to a horizontal east-west axis of confining stress. The rupture also occurred partially on the New Madrid Fault, responsible for the great New Madrid earthquakes in 1812, consisting of the most powerful earthquakes <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> contiguous United States.|$|E

Strong winds from the hurricane down many trees and power lines, with moderate to heavy building and crop damage reported near the coast. Rainfall reaches 6.8inches (173mm) in Miami, with storm tides peaking at 5.5feet (1.7m) in Pompano Beach.

5|$|Damage in {{the area}} around Acapulco was {{estimated}} at around 500million pesos ($40million USD). This made it the worst hurricane <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> city in at least 25years. Where Bridget made its final landfall, no damage reports were available due to the sparse population of the area.|$|E
50|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> turbine blades, the water's {{pressure}} (potential energy) {{is converted}} to kinetic energy by a nozzle {{and focused on the}} turbine. No pressure change occurs at the turbine blades, and the turbine doesn't require a housing for operation.|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the song}} being {{influenced}} from funk and rock, the indie rock music origins allowed it <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> alternative charts peaking at a moderately successful number 16 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and due {{to the song}}'s number 1 success on the pop charts, it led to be played often on modern rock radio stations despite only hitting number 16.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} storm had {{weakened}} drastically by this time, Tess killed 37people in Vietnam, destroyed thousands of homes, and inflicted $11million in damage. Following Tess, Philippine President Corazon Aquino visited the provinces of Pangasinan and Pampanga, both situated {{to the north of}} Manila to tour damaged areas, distribute relief, aid and inaugurate an infrastructure project. A mere few days after Tess, Typhoon Skip became the third cyclone <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> archipelago in two weeks.|$|E
5|$|In each of {{the cases}} above, the actual score is irrelevant; the {{projectiles}} simply have <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> target sheet within the circles. Also in each case, the applicant is allowed 3 test shots to familiarize with the particular firearm used for the test. The shotgun is an exception to this, where only one round is allowed as a test shot.|$|E

In 1997, Hurricane Pauline struck southern Mexico, becoming the deadliest tropical cyclone <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> country since Liza. As of 2006, no hurricane in Baja California Sur has been as bad as Liza.|$|E
