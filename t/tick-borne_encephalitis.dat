5|$|Dengue fever virus (DENV) is an RNA virus of {{the family}} Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus. Other {{members of the same}} genus include yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, St. Louis {{encephalitis}} virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, <b>tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus. Most are transmitted by arthropods (mosquitoes or ticks), and are therefore also referred to as arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses).|$|E
5|$|Adult birds may {{be killed}} by cats, little owls and sparrowhawks, and eggs and nestlings are taken by magpies, jays, and, where present, grey squirrels. As with other {{passerine}} birds, parasites are common, and include endoparasites, such as the nematode Splendidofilaria (Avifilaria) mavis whose specific name mavis derives from this thrush. A Russian study of blood parasites showed that all the fieldfares, redwings and song thrushes sampled carried haematozoans, particularly Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma. Ixodes ticks are also common, and can carry pathogens, including <b>tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> in forested areas {{of central and eastern}} Europe and Russia, and, more widely, Borrelia bacteria. Some species of Borrelia cause Lyme disease, and ground-feeding birds like the song thrush may act as a reservoir for the disease.|$|E

These may come into wide use to effectively prevent this severe disease in the huge populations of Asia - North, South and Southeast.|$|E
25|$|Ticks that {{transmit}} B. burgdorferi {{to humans}} can also carry and transmit several other parasites, such as Theileria microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, which cause the diseases babesiosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), respectively. Among early Lyme disease patients, {{depending on their}} location, 2–12% will also have HGA and 2–40% will have babesiosis. Ticks in certain regions, including the lands along the eastern Baltic Sea, also transmit <b>tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis.</b>|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} concern regarding wildlife zoonoses.

This advice is summarized for a variety of wildlife zoonoses in North America including rabies, hantavirus, tularemia, plague, psittacosis, baylisascaris, alveolar echinococcosis, arthropod-borne <b>encephalitis,</b> <b>tick-borne</b> diseases, and food safety related to game meat.

40|$|AbstractFollowing a bite from an {{infected}} tick, <b>tick-borne</b> flaviviruses cause <b>encephalitis,</b> meningitis and hemorrhagic fever in humans. Although these viruses {{spend most of}} their time in the tick, little is known regarding the virus–vector interactions. We developed a simple method for synchronously infecting Ixodes scapularis larvae with Langat virus (LGTV) by immersion in media containing the virus. This technique resulted in approximately 96 % of ticks becoming infected. LGTV infection and replication were demonstrated by both viral antigen expression and the accumulation of viral RNA. Furthermore, ticks transmitted LGTV to 100 % of the mice and maintained the virus through molting into the next life stage. This technique circumvents limitations present in the current methods by mimicking the natural route of infection and by using attenuated virus strains to infect ticks, thereby making this technique a powerful tool to study both virus and tick determinants of replication, pathogenesis and transmission...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} awareness of the importance of arthropod-borne viruses in the Western Pacific region and in South-East Asia. This realization of the importance of these viruses as causes of human morbidity and mortality and of economic loss due to infection of domestic animals has led to studies attempting to elucidate the basic ecology of some of these viruses. The author reviews the extent of knowledge of the ecology of Japanese and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses and indicates possible mechanisms for the overwintering of the viruses based on experiments in which other viruses were mainly used. He discusses the limited available knowledge on the ecology of dengue and emphasizes the necessity of research on the possibility that this disease is a zoonosis. A brief discussion is also given of the haemorrhagic diseases which are found in these regions and {{a brief description of the}} state of knowledge on the ecology of Kyasanur Forest disease and epidemic nephroso-nephritis.

25|$|Flaviviruses {{constitute}} {{a family of}} linear, single-stranded RNA(+) viruses. Flaviviruses include the West Nile virus, dengue virus, <b>Tick-borne</b> <b>Encephalitis</b> Virus, Yellow Fever Virus, and several other viruses. Many flavivirus species can replicate in both mammalian and insect cells. Most flaviviruses are arthropod borne and multiply in both vertebrates and arthropods. The viruses in this family that are of veterinary importance include Japanese encephalitis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Israel turkey meningoencephalomyelitis virus, Sitiawan virus, Wesselsbron virus, yellow fever virus and the tick-borne flaviviruses e.g. louping ill virus.|$|E
25|$|Transmission to {{vertebrates}} usually occurs via a tick vector. THOV {{persists in}} the tick, {{remaining in the}} organism as it goes through its developmental stages; this is called transstadial transmission. The virus can be transmitted to another host within a day of attachment to the host. THOV can be transmitted between ticks when they feed simultaneously on apparently uninfected guinea pigs, {{in the absence of}} a detectable level of virus in the blood. Such nonviraemic transmission has also been observed with other predominantly tick-transmitted RNA viruses, including bluetongue, Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever, louping ill, <b>tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> vesicular stomatitis virus and West Nile virus viruses. Transmission of DHOV by respiratory aerosol has also been observed.|$|E
25|$|Big {{wild animals}} such as bears and wolves are common in parts of Siberia and Russia's Far East, they also inhabit some thick forests north and east of Moscow in European Russia; female bears can be {{especially}} dangerous when they have cubs, while male bears are especially dangerous if they wake up and roam in wintertime; wolves are dangerous in the winter period. The only poisonous snake in central European Russia is the viper; it mainly inhabits boggy and marshy forests but can occasionally be met in other types of forests, so high boots are advisable for forest trips and hikes. <b>Tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> is another hazard {{that is associated with}} forests and parks in Russia. Animals that are most prone to rabies are stray dogs and cats, wild foxes, wolves, hedgehogs, racoon dogs.|$|E
40|$|Powassan virus (POWV) {{is a rare}} <b>tick-borne</b> {{agent of}} <b>encephalitis</b> in North America. Historically, confi rmed cases {{occurred}} mainly in the northeastern United States. Since 2008, confi rmed cases in Minnesota and Wisconsin have increased. We report a fatal case of POWV encephalitis in Minnesota. POWV infection should be suspected in tickexposed patients with viral encephalitis, Case Report A 67 -year-old woman from Aitkin, Minnesota, USA, sought treatment at a local hospital on May 30, 2011, with a 3 -day history of dizziness, fever of up to 103 °F (39. 4 °C), chills, malaise, nausea, and occasional confusion with slurred speech. She had no respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms and no history of ill contacts, travel, environmental exposures, or other recent illness. She had not been exposed to animals or vectors, other than those endemic to her area of residence, which included mosquitoes and deer ticks. She had removed many deer ticks after gardening or hiking in the woods. The patient’s past medical history was notable for colon cancer, which had been treated with a partial colectomy in October 2010 and chemotherapy through April 2011. She also {{had a history of}} hypertension, cutaneous lupus, and a remote cerebral aneurysm with surgical clipping. Medications she was taking were atenolol, hydroxychloroquine, and valsartan. On admission, the woman was alert and reported mild neck tenderness. Her temperature was 100 °F (37. 8 °C), blood pressure 138 / 77 mm Hg, pulse rate 83 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 98 % on room air. Results of neurologic, cardiac, and respiratory examinations were normal. Studies with normal test results included comprehensive metabolic panel, urinalysis, computed tomographic scan of the head, and chest radiograph.
