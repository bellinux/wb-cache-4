40|$|Electrical {{and optical}} {{properties}} of the (N,Ga) -doped ZnO films have been studied. Three growth regions were identified to obtain ZnO films with different conduction types depending on the N/Ga flux ratio in doping process. The PL spectra show evident competition between neutral-donor bound exciton (D 0 X) and neutral-acceptor bound exciton (A 0 X) according to the N/Ga ratio. From the temperature-dependent PL spectra, the nitrogen acceptor level was identified to be about 126 meV in (N,Ga) -doped p-type ZnO. For nitrogen doping of ZnO thin films, DMHy {{was used as the}} nitrogen dopant source. A narrow temperature window from about 500 °C to 550 °C for efficient nitrogen doping was identified. However, p-type ZnO was not obtained by nitrogen mono-doping, which results from the low solubility of N and the self-compensating effect of native defects, and/or N-induced complexes. By co-doping N with Ga in proper ratios, p-type ZnO films were successfully achieved with a high hole concentration of 3. 51 x 1017 [...] 2. 41 x 1018 cm- 3, Hall mobility of 1. 1 [...] 4. 29 cm 2 /V-s and resistivity of 0. 6 [...] 16. 2 O cm. But the conduction type critically depends on the growth conditions. Based on the successfully fabrication of (N,Ga) -doped p-type ZnO, a p-ZnO:(N,Ga) /n-ZnO homojunction was fabricated. The I-V measurement shows clear rectifying behavior with a turn-on voltage of about 3. 7 V. Further investigation of the effect of N/Ga doping ratios on the conduction type of ZnO samples reveals that successful doping depends much on engineering a stable local chemical bonding environment. Under mono-doping conditions (via N-Zn 4), nitrogen solubility is limited and nitrogen acceptors are readily compensated by native donors and/or N-related donors; under appropriate N/Ga flux ratios, cluster-doping (via Ga-N 3 O and Ga-N 4) can be realized to achieve p-type ZnO; while excessively high N/Ga ratios cause the doped ZnO n-type conductivity again, which may be because that under excessively high N/Ga ratio range, N-Zn 4 configuration dominates and thus cause more N-related donors and degrade the ZnO film quality, similar as the mono-doping case. By tuning the N/Ga ratio in doping, it is expected to create appropriate chemical environments to enhance the formation of desired dopant species for stable p-type ZnO. In this work, Metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) growth of ZnO and its p-type doping have been studied. The group V element N was used as primary dopant to make ZnO p-type. In the growth of ZnO by MOCVD, {{it was found that the}} structural and morphological properties of deposited ZnO strongly depend on growth conditions. Low VI/II ratio and high growth rate favor the growth of ZnO nanostructures (nanowires, nanobelts); while high VI/II ratio and low growth rate favor the growth of ZnO thin films. The semiconductor ZnO is currently gaining intense interest in the research community because of its prospect in optoelectronic applications, such as blue/ultraviolet emitters and detectors, and high speed electronic devices. However, making reliable and reproducible p-type ZnO is still a bottleneck, which impedes the practical application of ZnO-based devices. The difficulty is mainly due to <b>the</b> <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> of native defects and the low solubility limit of acceptor dopants. Although substantial research is currently being carried out worldwide towards this goal, the effective p-type dopant and its doping process have not yet been identified. Wang, Hui. "Apr 2008.

30|$|Semiconductor {{nanoparticles}} termed {{quantum dots}} (QDs) have drawn wide attention {{in recent years}} as light-emitting source for light-emitting diode (LED) applications, whose emission spectrum with narrow linewidth can be tuned by changing the energy bandgaps with the variation in QD sizes and shapes [1 – 7]. Numerous experiments present in literature on the high-performance electroluminescence (EL) properties of LEDs based on CdS [8, 9], CdSe [10, 11], and PbS [12, 13] colloidal QD thin film. However, the widespread employment of heavy metal ions, particularly Cd and Pb, are a serious hazard to human health {{as well as to the}} environment [14]. Therefore, it necessitates alternative approaches for developing QD-LEDs with the heavy-metal free composition. Nontoxic ZnO QDs with a tunable direct wide bandgap and a large exciton binding energy of 60  meV at room temperature are very promising for solid-state LED applications [15, 16]. However, the main issue, the lack of high-quality and stable p-type doing of ZnO due to <b>the</b> strong <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> of native point defects such as zinc interstitial or oxygen vacancy, still remained. Thus, n-ZnO/p-GaN heterojunction LEDs are offered as an alternative approach due to the low lattice mismatch (1.9 %), similar bandgap energy between ZnO and GaN, and the same wurtzite crystal structure. Nevertheless, the spontaneous polarization of GaN [17 – 19] and the interfacial energy barrier between ZnO QDs and GaN will necessarily reduce the performance of the device, thus resulting the low EL efficiency of the device. To improve the EL efficiency of the LEDs, localized surface plasmon (LSP) has been introduced into n-ZnO/p-GaN LEDs to improve EL performance of the device. Recently, different metals like Au, Ag, and Pt have been observed to enhance the EL performance due to the enhancement of the internal quantum efficiency [20 – 26]. More recently, Lu et al. demonstrated a more than 30 -fold EL enhancement of Al nanoparticle-decorated n-ZnO nanorod/p-GaN LEDs compared with that of the bare one [27]. Liu et al. showed the devices of LSP-enhanced ZnO/SiO 2 core/shell nanorod array/p-GaN heterostructure LEDs containing decorated with Ag nanoparticles. In comparison with the bare UV LEDs, the maximum enhancement ration of the Ag nanoparticle-decorated LEDs in EL is sevenfold [28]. However, many reports are mainly focused on the LSP-enhanced LEDs based on ZnO nanorods; there has been no literature concerning the LSP-enhanced EL emission in ZnO QD-based LED structure.|$|R

30|$|However, {{this kind}} of growth proposes a new method to control the N: ZnO structure. Furthermore, {{there is a big}} {{difference}} for the carrier concentration and mobility at different oxidation stages. These provide possibility to prepare p-type ZnO and to improve the concentration and mobility of the carrier. In our study, there are several reasons that lead to the n-type formation and the low carrier concentration and mobility. (1) The substrate temperature maintains at room temperature the deposition of the as-deposited Zn-N film in this study. There are a lot of donor impurities (oxygen vacancy, interstitial zinc, etc.) [42], which lead to a strong <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> after oxidation. (2) N content is too low. The lower N concentration results in the lower N substitution in the O lattice (No). This leads to the formation of n-type N: ZnO and the decrease of carrier concentration. In addition, this leads to the electrical properties of the films which are similar with those of the pure ZnO thin film (n-type) and also the lower carrier concentration [43]. Furthermore, the insulating quartz substrate is nonconductive to generate p-type semiconductors [44].|$|R
30|$|From the {{development}} of Ga 2 O 3, this material still has some disadvantages as follows. (1) P-type doping is a big challenge of Ga 2 O 3 material. Because the acceptor levels are far from the valence band of β-Ga 2 O 3, the activation energy of acceptor impurities is very high. Meanwhile, the n-type background impurities in Ga 2 O 3 crystal will also produce <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> on acceptor impurities, resulting to the self-insulating of the material. Therefore, there still has been no effective p-type doing. (2) The thermal conductivity of Ga 2 O 3 is too low. Experimental and theoretical investigations have proved that the thermal conductivity of β-Ga 2 O 3 is just only 0.1 – 0.3  W cm− 1  K− 1 [51 – 53]. This is adverse to the power device used in high-voltage and high-current circumstance. Excessive heat accumulation will seriously affect the performance and reliability of the device. (3) Carrier mobility is low. The theoretical mobility of Ga 2 O 3 is limited to about 200  cm 2 /V s due {{to the influence of}} scattering [54]. Low mobility has a negative impact on the frequency and current characteristics.|$|R
