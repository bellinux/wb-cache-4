50|$|In July 2011, co-founder Silverwood {{went on a}} {{research}} expedition to document the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, also known as North Pacific Gyre or Pacific <b>Trash</b> <b>Vortex.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Great Pacific garbage patch, also {{described}} as the Pacific <b>trash</b> <b>vortex,</b> is a gyre of marine debris particles in the central North Pacific Ocean discovered between 1985 and 1988. It is located roughly between 135°W to 155°W and 35°N and 42°N. The patch extends over an indeterminate area of widely varying range depending {{on the degree of}} plastic concentration used to define the affected area.|$|E
50|$|In a not {{too distant}} future, a Plastic Bag (voice of Werner Herzog) goes on an epic journey {{in search of}} its lost Maker, {{wondering}} {{if there is any}} point to life without her. The Bag encounters strange creatures, brief love in the sky, a colony of prophetic torn bags on a fence and the unknown. To be with its own kind, the Bag goes deep under the oceans into 500 nmi km of spinning garbage known as the North Pacific <b>Trash</b> <b>Vortex.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Wu Ming-Yi (born June 20, 1971) is a {{multidisciplinary}} Taiwanese artist, author, academic and environmental activist. In Chinese, he is especially {{well known for}} his non-fiction books on butterflies, The Book of Lost Butterflies (2000) and The Dao of Butterflies (2003), which he also designed and illustrated. His ecological parable The Man with Compound Eyes (2011) was published in English August 29, 2013 by Harvill Secker and {{will be published by}} Vintage Pantheon in North America in spring, 2014. This novel, which {{tells the story of a}} young Pacific islander, Atelie (Atile'i in the English translation), from the fictitious island of Wayo Wayo (suggesting Bora Bora) who arrives on the East Coast of Taiwan when the 'trash vortex', a floating mountain of trash which has formed out of the Great Pacific <b>Trash</b> <b>Vortex,</b> collides with the island, has been described as [...] "a masterpiece of environmental literature about an apocalyptic aboriginal encounter with modernity...Trash, resource shortages, and the destruction of Taiwan's coastline as a result of the pursuit of unenlightened self-interest are unremarkable raw materials, but Mingyi mashes them into art." ...|$|E
40|$|The rhizome concept {{explored}} by Deleuze and Guatarri {{has had an}} important influence on formal thinking in music and new media. This paper explores the development of rhizomatic musical scores that are arranged cartographically with nodal points allowing for alternate pathways to be traversed. The challenges of pre-digital exemplars of rhizomatic structure are discussed. It follows the development of concepts and technology used {{in the creation of}} five works by the author Ubahn c. 1985 : the Rosenberg Variations [2012], The Last Years [2012], Sacrificial Zones [2014], detritus [2015] and <b>trash</b> <b>vortex</b> [2015]. this paper discusses the potential for the evolution of novel formal structures using rhizomatic structures...|$|E
40|$|Sterk {{translates}} {{the literary}} work 2 ̆ 2 The {{man with the}} compound eyes 2 ̆ 2 《複眼人》, written by Wu Ming-Yi (吳明益). Taipei, Summer Festival Press, 2011. In the novel, {{on the island of}} Wayo Wayo, every second son must leave on the day he turns fifteen as a sacrifice to the Sea God. Atile’i is one such boy, but as the strongest swimmer and best sailor, he is determined to defy destiny and become the first to survive. Alice Shih, who has lost her husband and son in a climbing accident, is quietly preparing to commit suicide in her house by the sea. But her plan is interrupted when a vast <b>trash</b> <b>vortex</b> comes crashing onto the shore of Taiwan, bringing Atile’i with it. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, Atile’i and Alice retrace her late husband’s footsteps into the mountains, hoping to solve the mystery of her son’s disappearance. On their journey, memories will be challenged, an unusual bond formed, and a dark secret uncovered that will force Alice to question everything she thought she knew...|$|E
40|$|The {{main subject}} of the essay {{consists}} in the literary representation of environment as a mixed system, half natural and half human. The symbolic value and the great significance of ecological themes in the contemporary literature are related to this environmental double entity.   The essay particularly highlights the presence {{and the importance of}} trash, waste, garbage in three contemporary fiction and non-fiction novels: Les météores by the French writer Michel Tournier; Underworld by Don DeLillo; Gomorra, the docu-fictional report of the Italian journalist and writer Roberto Saviano about the illicit traffics of ‘Camorra’.   The word ‘waste’ and his synonyms define composite and impure materials, that sometimes slips every clear distinction between nature and handicrafts: on this subject, we can think about the Pacific <b>Trash</b> <b>Vortex,</b> a sort of island or ‘Atlantis’ of garbage formed in the Pacific Ocean by the rubbish and shaped by the oceanic streams.      If we can’t identify clear boundaries between nature and human activities, we can’t either separate the two dimensions from an ethical point of view.   The literary works considered in the essay show the importance of admitting the weakness of the boundaries to go beyond obsolete distinctions (such as city vs country, nature vs culture) ...|$|E
40|$|For me, {{until the}} summer of 2011, Taiwan {{literature}} had mostly been 2 ̆ 7 on the page 2 ̆ 7, so to speak. I 2 ̆ 7 d been translating for the Taipei Chinese Pen for several years. The Pen would send me an essay and a story, and I would translate it, rewrite it several dozen times {{and send it to}} the editor and proofreader for suggestions or corrections, which I would mostly ignore before going on to rewrite it again. But in {{the summer of}} 2011, I met Gray Tan and was soon engaged to translate a sample of Wu Ming-Yi 2 ̆ 7 s THE MAN WITH THE COMPOUND EYES about a <b>trash</b> <b>vortex</b> in the Pacific. Little did I know I would soon be engulfed in a vortex of activities related to literary translation. I kept translating in my own fashion. But in time, I also had {{to do a lot of}} extra-textual events, for which I wasn 2 ̆ 7 t exactly trained. I was a Sinologist, writing my dissertation on post-war Taiwanese film and fiction. Ask anyone doing a Ph. D. on contemporary literature and you 2 ̆ 7 ll hear a lot about critical readings of different kinds: Marxist, feminist, postcolonial, New Historicist, whatever. When I got my Ph. D., I was proud of how 2 ̆ 7 critical 2 ̆ 7 I had become and how well I was able to 2 ̆ 7 read 2 ̆ 7. But for better or for worse, there was no time for critical rants about capitalism in the extra-textual activities which became a natural extension of my translation of THE MAN WITH THE COMPOUND EYES. Indeed, the novel was itself partly a capitalist commodity and my job was to promote it. A Ph. D. is no practice for promote things and was worried that I wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t be able to do it. Luckily, Gray Tan picked the right book, particularly for me. THE MAN WITH THE COMPOUND EYES is easy to be enthusiastic about, and the writer, as I soon discovered, is a really nice guy. Wu Ming-Yi 2 ̆ 7 s environmental concern is something I share and his scientific knowledge, of tiger butterflies, Moltrechi 2 ̆ 7 s tree frogs and albino banyan trees, simply blows me away. The audiences I addressed were mostly people who love literature and care about the environment. Promotion has never been easier...|$|E
