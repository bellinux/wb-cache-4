5|$|Despite {{sovereign}} debt having risen substantially {{in only a}} few eurozone countries, with the three most affected countries Greece, Ireland and Portugal collectively only accounting for 6% of the eurozone's gross domestic product (GDP), it has become a perceived problem for the area as a whole, leading to speculation of further contagion of other European countries and a possible break-up of the eurozone. In total, <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> forced five out of 17 eurozone countries to seek help from other nations by the end of 2012.|$|E

5|$|The {{detailed}} {{causes of}} <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> varied. In several countries, private debts arising from a property bubble {{were transferred to}} sovereign debt {{as a result of}} banking system bailouts and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble. The structure of the eurozone as a currency union (i.e., one currency) without fiscal union (e.g., different tax and public pension rules) contributed to the crisis and limited the ability of European leaders to respond. European banks own a significant amount of sovereign debt, such that concerns regarding the solvency of banking systems or sovereigns are negatively reinforcing.|$|E
30|$|Similar to Hypothesis 4, {{the number}} of {{countries}} that suffered from <b>the</b> sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> increased during <b>the</b> European <b>Debt</b> <b>Crisis.</b> Furthermore, as <b>the</b> European <b>Debt</b> <b>Crisis</b> is regarded to be a sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> and also <b>the</b> sequel of the Subprime Crisis, there are fewer government bond markets of high quality. Therefore, government bonds cannot be treated as quality assets and the flight to quality also became less frequent during <b>the</b> European <b>Debt</b> <b>Crisis.</b>|$|R

40|$|Five {{years after}} the start of the worst {{financial}} and economic crisis {{since the end of the}} World War II the euro area countries are confronted with the persistence of <b>the</b> public <b>debt</b> <b>crisis.</b> <b>The</b> recent literature on macro-financial topics identifies the main factors that determined the launch of <b>the</b> sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> in Europe. One of the consequences of this crisis consists in <b>the</b> public <b>debt</b> effect.

25|$|The Plano Real ("Real Plan"), instituted in {{the spring}} 1994, sought to break inflationary {{expectations}} by pegging the real to the US dollar. Inflation was brought down to single digit annual figures, but not fast enough to avoid substantial real exchange rate appreciation during the transition phase of the Plano Real. This appreciation meant that Brazilian goods were now more expensive relative to goods from other countries, which contributed to large current account deficits. However, no shortage of foreign currency ensued because of the financial community's renewed interest in Brazilian markets as inflation rates stabilized and memories of <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> of the 1980s faded.|$|E
25|$|Privatizations {{were viewed}} by the World Bank and the IMF in the 1990s as the {{preferred}} solution for developing countries such as Argentina to overcome <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> <b>crisis.</b> Accordingly, the Menem administration secured special powers from Congress, which enacted new legislation in shortly after his inaugural in 1989 authorizing the sale of some 300 state enterprises for US$24 billion. The proceeds were largely channeled toward repayment and monetization of the US$65 billion foreign debt (90% of which {{was found in a}} 1984 Economy Ministry audit to be fraudulent in nature). The US$31 billion in Brady Bonds issued for this purpose deepened the nation's debt crisis, however, because while Argentina serviced them at face value, the bonds typically traded at a steep discount.|$|E

Marriott tried to calm the city's fears by saying it had not yet approached the capital markets to seek private financing, and would not do so until at least April 2009.|$|E

25|$|Following the Asian {{financial}} crisis in 1998 the currency devaluated to UAH 5.6 = USD 1.00 in February 2000. Later, {{the exchange rate}} remained relatively stable at around 5.4 hryvnias for 1 US dollar and was fixed to 5.05 hryvnias for 1 US dollar from 21 April 2005 until 21 May 2008. In mid-October 2008 rapid devaluation began, {{in the course of}} a global {{financial crisis}} that hit Ukraine hard, with the hryvnia dropping 38.4% from UAH 4.85 for USD 1 on 23 September 2008 to UAH 7.88 for USD 1 on 19 December 2008. After a period of instability, a new peg of 8 hryvnias per US dollar was established, and remained for several years. In 2012, the peg was changed to a managed float (much like that of the Chinese yuan) as the euro and other European countries' currencies weakened against the dollar due to <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> in Greece, and the value in mid-2012 was about 8.14 UAH per dollar.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} economists have {{dismissed}} the popular belief that <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> {{was caused by}} excessive social welfare spending. According to their analysis, increased debt levels were mostly due to the large bailout packages provided to the financial sector during the late-2000s financial crisis, and the global economic slowdown thereafter. The average fiscal deficit in the euro area in 2007 was only 0.6% before it grew to 7% during the financial crisis. In the same period, the average government debt rose from 66% to 84% of GDP. The authors also stressed that fiscal deficits in the euro area were stable or even shrinking since the early 1990s. US economist Paul Krugman named Greece as the only country where fiscal irresponsibility {{is at the heart}} of the crisis. British economic historian Robert Skidelsky added that it was indeed excessive lending by banks, not deficit spending that created this crisis. Government's mounting debts are a response to the economic downturn as spending rises and tax revenues fall, not its cause.|$|E
25|$|From its inception, the Peruvian {{electricity}} system {{started to}} be developed by private initiative. In 1955, Law No. 12378 regulated the mechanisms of private participation, establishing a system of concessions with commitments to increase generation capacity by 10% annually. The National Tariff Commission and other mechanisms aiming at guaranteeing the profitability of the investments were then created. However, {{at the beginning of}} the 1970s, profound changes took place. In 1972, the de facto military government nationalized the electricity industry through Law No.19521, creating ELECTROPERU (Peru Electricity Company). ELECTROPERU became the owner of all the generation, transmission and distribution assets and came to be in charge of service provision and investment planning. Until the beginning of the 1980s there were large investments in hydroelectric and thermal projects. However, this dynamism started to fade during the 1980s mainly due to <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> that started in 1982 and that precluded new financing in the region. By the beginning of the 1990s, the electricity sector in Peru showed an important deterioration due to low investment in infrastructure, the fact that tariffs did not cover production costs, the restricted investment in maintenance and the systematic destruction of infrastructures by terrorist activities. The results of this crisis were severe: in 1990 only 45% of the population had access to electricity, supply only covered 74% of the demand and distribution losses were above 20%.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how Chinese FDI in Europe {{has responded to}} the privatization of public assets {{in the wake of}} <b>the</b> sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>crisis.</b> <b>The</b> push and pull framework is used to analyze the driving forces behind Chinese FDI in Europe.

500|$|As <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> {{expanded}} beyond Greece, these economists {{continued to}} advocate, albeit more forcefully, the disbandment of the eurozone. If {{this was not}} immediately feasible, they recommended that Greece and the other debtor nations unilaterally leave the eurozone, default on their debts, regain their fiscal sovereignty, and re-adopt national currencies. Bloomberg suggested in June 2011 that, if the Greek and Irish bailouts should fail, an alternative would be for Germany to leave the eurozone to save the currency through depreciation instead of austerity. The likely substantial fall in the euro against a newly reconstituted Deutsche Mark would give a [...] "huge boost" [...] to its members' competitiveness.|$|E
500|$|This way the ECB {{tried to}} make sure that banks have enough cash to pay off their own {{maturing}} debts {{in the first three months}} of 2012, and at the same time keep operating and loaning to businesses so that a credit crunch does not choke off economic growth. It also hoped that banks would use some of the money to buy government bonds, effectively easing <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> <b>crisis.</b> On 29 February 2012, the ECB held a second auction, LTRO2, providing 800 eurozone banks with further [...] in cheap loans.

When {{it became clear that}} no party would achieve the outright majority needed to form the next government, the three main party leaders made public statements offering to discuss the options for putting together an administration with the other parties. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg called on Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Conservative leader David Cameron to act [...] "in the national interest and not out of narrow party political advantage". However, having stated before the election that the party with the most seats should have the initial say on forming a government, Clegg announced his intention to begin talks with the Conservative Party. Speaking outside the Liberal Democrat headquarters he said: [...] "It is now for the Conservative Party to prove that it is capable of seeking to govern in the national interest." [...] Brown said he intended to play his part in securing [...] "a stable, strong and principled government", and indicated his willingness to speak with both Clegg and Cameron on how to achieve this, saying: [...] "What we have seen are no ordinary election results." [...] But shortly after, Cameron held a press conference at which he invited the Liberal Democrats to talks, saying: [...] "I want to make a big, open and comprehensive offer to the Liberal Democrats.
