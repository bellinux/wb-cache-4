5|$|The Spanish left a deep mark on Texas. Their European {{livestock}} caused mesquite {{to spread}} inland while farmers <b>tilled</b> and irrigated the land, changing the landscape forever. The Spanish language provided the names {{for many of}} the rivers, towns, and counties that currently exist, and Spanish architectural concepts still flourish. Although Texas eventually adopted much of the Anglo-American legal system, many Spanish legal practices were retained, including the concept of a homestead exemption and community property.|$|E
5|$|The {{improvements}} {{of animal}} husbandry {{in the medieval}} period in Europe went {{hand in hand with}} other developments. Improvements to the plough allowed the soil to be <b>tilled</b> to a greater depth. Horses took over from oxen as the main providers of traction, new ideas on crop rotation were developed and the growing of crops for winter fodder gained ground. Peas, beans and vetches became common; they increased soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, allowing more livestock to be kept.|$|E

Called the kuritoro bird in New Guinea's eastern highlands, its appearance was significant in the mourning ceremony by a widow for her dead husband. She would offer him banana flowers; the presence of the bird singing nearby would confirm that the dead man's soul had taken the offering.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} of the imagination, and a free-flowing connection to the unconscious brought about a renewed interest in his work. Bosch's imagery struck a chord with Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The <b>Tilled</b> Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of Bosch's Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT We present sedimentological {{observations}} from the Tiskilwa <b>Till</b> in northern Illinois, and the Sky Pilot <b>Till</b> in northern Manitoba, that indicate deposition of these <b>tills</b> by subglacial defor-mation. These generally homogenous <b>tills</b> grade downward into more heterogeneous <b>tills</b> that incorporate underlying sediment into their matrix, indicating entrainment of older sediments by sediment defor-mation. Deformed sand inclusions within these <b>tills</b> imply deformation of the <b>tills</b> and inclusions prior to deposition. The Tiskilwa <b>Till</b> has rela-tively high fabric strength throughout its thickness, whereas fabric {{strength in the}} Sky Pilot <b>Till</b> generally increases up-section in 2 to 3 m thick increments. Fabric orientations in both <b>tills</b> rotate up-section, possibly due to changes in ice-flow direction associated with the thic-kening and thinning of ice, and changes in ice-flow divide location. In both the Tiskilwa and Sky Pilot <b>Tills,</b> the change in fabric orientation occurs over intervals of ~ 1 m, suggesting that the maximum depth of deformation was ≤ 1 m insofar as any greater depth of deformation would have reoriented <b>till</b> fabric during maximum ice extent and retreat. In {{the case of the}} Sky Pilot <b>Till,</b> the up-section increase in macrofabric strength indicates that strain increased up-section. These data suggest that these <b>tills</b> were deposited in a time transgressive manner as strain migrated upwards with the delivery of new <b>till</b> either released from the ice base or advected from up-ice.

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of the people lived in villages and agriculture was their main occupation. The economy of the kingdom was based on agriculture. Grains, pulses, vegetables and flowers were cultivated. Commercial crops included sugarcane and cotton. The agrarian population consisted of landlords (gavunda, zamindar, heggadde) who <b>tilled</b> the land by employing a number of landless labourers, usually paying them in grain. Minor cultivators were also willing to hire themselves out as labourers if the need arose. It was due to the availability of these landless labourers that kings and landlords were able to execute major projects such as palaces, temples, mosques, anicuts (dams) and tanks. Because land was abundant and the population relatively sparse, no rent was charged on land ownership. Instead, landowners paid tax for cultivation, which amounted to up to one-half of all harvested produce.|$|E
5|$|Certain occupations were {{traditionally}} {{reserved for}} women, {{while they were}} also exempted from corvée labor duties. Women were expected to rear children, weave clothes for the family, and perform domestic duties such as cooking; although farming was considered men's work, sometimes women <b>tilled</b> fields alongside their husbands and brothers. Some women formed communal spinning and weaving groups to pool resources together to pay for candles, lamp oil, and heat during night and winter. A successful textile business could employ hundreds of women. Singing and dancing to entertain wealthy patrons were other common professions open for women. When a husband died, sometimes the widow became the sole supporter of her children, and thus {{had to make a}} living weaving silk cloths or making straw sandals to sell in the market. Some women also turned to the humble profession of sorcery for income. Other more fortunate women could become renowned medical physicians who provided services to the families of high officials and nobility. Some wealthy women engaged in luxury trade, such as one who frequently sold pearls to a princess. Some even aided in their husband's business decisions. Female merchants dressed in silk clothes which rivaled even female nobles' attire were considered immoral compared to the ideal woman weaver.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} who needed additional funds for education or vied for political office found farming as a decent profession which, although humble, was not {{looked down upon}} by fellow gentrymen. Wealthy nobles, officials, and merchants could own land, but they often did not cultivate it themselves and merely acted as absentee landlords while living in the city. They mostly relied on poor tenant farmers (diannong 佃農) who paid rent {{in the form of}} roughly fifty percent of their produce in exchange for land, tools, draft animals, and a small house. Wage laborers (gunong 雇農) and slaves were also employed on the estates of the wealthy, although they were not as numerous as tenants. During Western Han, the small independent owner-cultivator represented the majority of farming peasants, yet their economic struggle to remain independent during times of war, natural disaster and crisis drove many into debt, banditry, slavery, and dramatically increased the number of landless tenants by late Eastern Han. The social status of poor independent owner-cultivators was above tenants and wage laborers, yet below that of wealthy landowners. While wealthy landowners employed tenants and wage laborers, landowners who managed small to medium-sized estates often acted as managers over their sons who <b>tilled</b> the fields and daughters who weaved clothes and engaged in sericulture to produce silk for the home or sale at market.|$|E

40|$|Two <b>tills</b> in Hyvinkää {{represent}} one Weichselian glaciation: {{the lower}} <b>till,</b> named the Tanssikallio <b>Till,</b> being a basal lodgement <b>till</b> formed {{during the initial}} stage of the last Weichselian glaciation, and the upper <b>till,</b> named the Hyvinkää <b>Till,</b> being a basal melt-out <b>till</b> {{from the time of}} the deglaciation of southern Finland, before the formation of the first Salpausselkä marginal terrace. The <b>tills</b> can be compared with those earlier described from Kela west of Helsinki and from Vuosaari in Helsinki. The age of the lower basal lodgement <b>till,</b> when compared with the stratigraphy in Ostrobothnia, is not older than early Middle Weichselian. The possible ice-free interval between the deposition of the two <b>tills</b> at Vuosaari may correspond to the Middle Weichselian interstadial in Estonia. Elsewhere in southern Finland there is no conclusive stratigraphical evidence of an ice-free interval between an early Middle Weichselian and a Late Weichselian ice advance...|$|R
50|$|As {{developed}} between 1894 and 1909, the Kansan Stage {{was based on}} a model that assumed that the Pleistocene deposits contained only two glacial <b>tills</b> and one volcanic ash bed within Nebraska and Kansas. Of these two proposed glacial <b>tills,</b> the Kansan <b>till,</b> which defined the Kansan Stage, was the upper of the two glacial <b>tills</b> and the Nebraskan <b>till,</b> which defined the Nebraskan Stage, was the lower of the two glacial <b>tills.</b> It was argued that a single paleosol developed in the Nebraskan <b>till</b> and interglacial deposits separated the Kansan and Nebraskan <b>tills.</b> The paleosol and deposits were used to define the Aftonian (interglacial) stage that separated the Kansan and Nebraskan stages.|$|R
5|$|The Song {{government}} provided {{tax incentives}} to farmers who <b>tilled</b> lands {{along the edges}} of lakes, marshes, seas, and terraced mountain slopes. Farming was made possible in these difficult terrains due to improvements in damming techniques and using chain pumps to elevate water to higher irrigation planes. The 10th century introduction of early-ripening rice that could grow in varied climatic zones and topographic conditions allowed for a significantly large migration from the most productive lands that had been farmed for centuries into previously uninhabited areas in the surrounding hinterland of the Yangzi Valley and Southeast China, which experienced rapid development. The widespread cultivation of rice in China necessitated new trends of labor and agricultural techniques. An effective yield from rice paddies required careful transplanting of rows of rice seedlings, sufficient weeding, maintenance of water levels, and draining of fields for harvest. Planting and weeding often required a dirty day of work, since the farmers had to wade through the muddy water of the rice paddies on bare feet. For other crops, water buffalos were used as draft animals for ploughing and harrowing the fields, while properly aged and mixed compost and manure was constantly spread.|$|E

40|$|Glacial {{stratigraphy}} of the West Estonian Islands comprises {{three different}} diamicton units which are correlated event-stratigraphically to the Pandivere and Palivere ice advances {{of the most}} recent (Late Weichselian) glaciation and included into the Vörtsjärve Subformation according to Estonian stratigraphic nomenclature. A large number of <b>till</b> samples (1136) and drillcore sections (2500) were analysed {{in order to determine the}} genesis and composition of sediments from which the lithostratigraphical conclusions are derived. The two topmost diamictons are interpreted as genetic varieties of the Palivere <b>Till</b> - waterline melt-out and basal <b>till.</b> The Pandivere <b>Till</b> is the lowermost widespread <b>till</b> layer on the islands, which lies unconformably between the Palivere <b>Till</b> and carbonaceous bedrock. Lacustrine Köpu Sands separate the Palivere and Pandivere <b>Tills</b> in a few boreholes on the Köpu and Sörve Peninsulas. In deeply buried valleys on the Sörve Peninsula the Pandivere <b>Till</b> is underlain by lacustrine Viieristi Sands and greenish-grey compact <b>till</b> of unknown age.

40|$|The {{qualitative}} and quantitative characteristics of microstructures in a <b>till</b> were analysed with SEM; it was also investigated whether the results depend on the <b>till’s</b> mesostructural characteristics. The <b>till,</b> exposed in a few open-cast browncoal mines near Konin in central Poland, is cut by numerous fractures which correspond to Riedel shear patterns, P-type structures and C-S type foliations. The fractures developed {{as a result of}} simple shearing induced by movement of the base of the Odranian ice sheet. On the basis of fracture density, two <b>till</b> types are distinguished: coarsely-brecciated <b>till</b> (wide spacing of fractures) and finely-brecciated <b>till</b> (closely spaced fractures). It is found that the fracture density is reflected in the microstructure of the <b>till.</b> The finely-brecciated <b>till</b> is characterised by a high porosity and has predominantly anisometric and fissure-like pores that also show a more clearly preferred orientation than the pores in the coarsely-brecciated <b>till.</b> In contrast, the coarsely-brecciated <b>till</b> has anisometric pores that show a less preferential orientation. The porosity of the coarsely-brecciated <b>till</b> is lower than in the finely-brecciated <b>till.</b> The finely-brecciated <b>till</b> probably represents a strongly deformed deposit, related in some cases to zones developed along thrusts that cut the <b>till.</b> Positive correlation between the porosity, the spatial arrangement of pores, and the density of fractures suggests a synsedimentary origin of the shear strain. This strain was accommodated by a particulate flow developed within both wide, pervasive zones and narrow, localised zones. The hydraulic conditions within the subglacial shear zone controlled rheological differences within the <b>till</b> during deformation and thus influenced the degree of the microstructure alteration...|$|R

40|$|The {{rheology}} and hydro-mechanical interactions at the ice–bed interface form {{an important}} component of the glacier system, influencing glacier dynamics and the formation of <b>till.</b> We demonstrate that the sand-rich <b>till</b> at Briksdalsbreen in Norway, undergoes deformation throughout the year. On the bulk rheology scale, <b>till</b> deformation exhibits elastic behaviour during the winter, when water pressures are low; and linear viscous behaviour after a critical yield stress of 35 kPa, when water pressures are high during the spring and summer. On the clast and matrix scale, low water pressures, correspond with high case stress variability and <b>till</b> temperatures. Meltwater driven, stick-slip, glacier velocity increases were transmitted through a relatively strong <b>till</b> grain network, causing brittle deformation. Intermediate water pressures, during late summer were linked to intermediate case stress variability and high <b>till</b> temperatures associated with the heat generated from stick-slip motion. High water pressures in the <b>till</b> were associated with low case stress variability and low, meltwater controlled, <b>till</b> temperatures, and occurred in the spring and autumn. Once the <b>till</b> was saturated, the ductile <b>till</b> absorbed any stick-slip velocity increases. We discuss, with examples, the different <b>till</b> forming processes associated with these changing conditions, demonstrating that the resultant <b>till</b> will represent a complex amalgamation of all of these processes. <br/...|$|R
