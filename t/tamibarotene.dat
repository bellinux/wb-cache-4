50|$|Arsenic {{trioxide}} (As2O3) {{is currently}} being evaluated for treatment of relapsed / refractory disease. Remission with arsenic trioxide has been reported.Studies have shown arsenic reorganizes nuclear bodies and degrades the mutant PML-RAR fusion protein. Arsenic also increases caspase activity which then induces apoptosis. It does reduce the relapse rate for high risk patients. In Japan a synthetic retinoid, <b>tamibarotene,</b> is licensed {{for use as a}} treatment for ATRA-resistant APL.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tamibarotene</b> (brand name: Amnolake), {{also called}} retinobenzoic acid, is orally active, {{synthetic}} retinoid, developed to overcome all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) resistance, with potential antineoplastic activity against acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) [...] It is currently marketed only in Japan and early trials {{have demonstrated that}} {{it tends to be}} better tolerated than ATRA. It has also been investigated as a possible treatment for Alzheimer's disease, multiple myeloma and Crohn's disease.|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{graft-versus-host disease}} (GVHD) {{is a major}} cause of late death and {{morbidity}} following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT). Retinoic acid (<b>tamibarotene)</b> exerts multiple effects on cell differentiation and is clinically used for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. <b>Tamibarotene</b> down-regulates both Th 1 and Th 17 differentiation in donor T cells after allogeneic HSCT, resulting in attenuation of experimental chronic GVHD. Based on preclinical data, we have launched a phase II study of <b>tamibarotene</b> in patients with steroid-refractory chronic GVHD. This study will clarify whether <b>tamibarotene</b> can exert beneficial effects in patients with steroid-refractory chronic GVHD...|$|E
40|$|A 40 -year-old male {{developed}} refractory acute {{promyelocytic leukemia}} (APL) after various treatments including all-trans retinoic acid, <b>tamibarotene,</b> arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3), conventional chemotherapy, and autologous peripheral {{blood stem cell}} transplantation. We attempted to use both <b>tamibarotene</b> and As 2 O 3 as a combination therapy, and he achieved molecular complete remission. Grade 2 prolongation of the QTc interval on the electrocardiogram was observed during the therapy. The combination therapy of As 2 O 3 and <b>tamibarotene</b> may be effective and tolerable for treating refractory APL cases who have no treatment options, even when they have previously been treated with <b>tamibarotene</b> and As 2 O 3 as a single agent...|$|E
40|$|Tamibarotene-loaded {{biodegradable}} matrices with antithrombogenic and drug-releasing properties {{were prepared}} in a crosslinking reaction between amino groups of alkali-treated collagen (AlCol) and active ester groups of trisuccinimidyl citrate. The resulting matrices {{were characterized by}} their residual amino group concentrations, swelling ratios and thermal, antithrombogenic and drug-releasing properties. It was clarified that the addition of <b>tamibarotene</b> does not inhibit matrix formation. After immersion in water, the swelling ratio of a matrix became lower than that prior to immersion. Thermal analysis indicated that AlCol interacted with <b>tamibarotene.</b> The addition of <b>tamibarotene</b> to the matrix did not influence the antithrombogenic property of the resulting matrix. A matrix with a high crosslinking density had a prolonged <b>tamibarotene</b> elution time. These results demonstrate that tamibarotene-loaded matrices have great potential as a coating material for drug-eluting stents...|$|E
40|$|Treatment {{of acute}} promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) with arsenic {{trioxide}} (ATO) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is highly effective first-line therapy, although approximately 5 - 10 % of patients relapse. <b>Tamibarotene</b> is a synthetic retinoid with activity in APL patients who relapse after chemotherapy and ATRA, {{but has not}} been studied in relapse after treatment with ATO and ATRA. We report on a phase II study of <b>tamibarotene</b> in adult patients with relapsed or refractory APL after treatment with ATRA and ATO (n =  14). Participants were treated with <b>tamibarotene</b> (6  mg/m(2) /d) during induction and {{for up to six}} cycles of consolidation. The overall response rate was 64 % (n =  9), the rate of complete cytogenetic response was 43 % (n =  6) and the rate of complete molecular response was 21 % (n =  3). Relapse was frequent with 7 of 9 responders relapsing after a median of 4 · 6  months (range 1 · 6 - 26 · 8  months). The median event-free survival (EFS) was 3 · 5  months [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0 - 8 · 6  months] and the median overall survival (OS) was 9 · 5  months (95 % CI 5 · 9 - 13 · 1  months). These results demonstrate that <b>tamibarotene</b> has activity in relapsed APL after treatment with ATO and ATRA and further studies using <b>tamibarotene</b> as initial therapy and in combination with ATO are warranted...|$|E
40|$|A {{robust and}} high-yielding radiochemical {{synthesis}} of ¹¹C-N-cyanobenzamides using a palladium-mediated aminocarbonylation with ¹¹C-CO, aryl halides and cyanamide is described. The bidentate ligand 1, 1 ′-bis(diphenylphosphino) ferrocene provided ¹¹C-N-cyanobenzamides from aryl-iodides, bromides, triflates and even chlorides in 28 – 79 % radiochemical yield after semi-preparative HPLC. To further highlight {{the utility of}} this method, novel ¹¹C-N-cyanobenzamide analogs of flufenamic acid, meflanamic acid, dazoxiben and <b>tamibarotene</b> were synthesized in 34 – 71 % radiochemical yields...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to improve the {{solubility}} and oral bioavailability of <b>tamibarotene</b> by complexing it with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD). The inclusion complex of <b>tamibarotene</b> with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (Am 80 -HP-β-CD) was prepared through a freeze-drying method at the mole ratio of 1 : 1 (Am 80 : HP-β-CD). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated the formation of Am 80 -HP-β-CD. In vitro dissolution studies showed that the solubility and dissolution percentage of Am 80 -HP-β-CD was improved substantially compared to Am 80. An improved dissolution with approximately 97 % drug release in 3 [*]min was observed, in comparison with Am 80 with approximately 60 % release in 45 [*]min. In vivo studies indicated that the AUC 0 -∞ has increased 2. 79 times and the Cmax 4. 37 times after the formation of inclusion complex. The decrease of tmax indicated the Am 80 -HP-β-CD inclusion complex can be absorbed into blood faster. In short, the solubility and bio-availability of Am 80 has notably increased with the complexation of HP-β-CD. Therefore, using the inclusion technique is a promising method to improve the solubility of insoluble drugs...|$|E
40|$|Am 80 (<b>tamibarotene)</b> is a {{retinoic acid}} {{receptor}} (RAR) agonist clinically available {{for treatment of}} acute promyelocytic leukemia. As intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accompanies inflammatory reactions {{in the brain and}} also because retinoids may suppress activation of microglia, we investigated the effect of Am 80 on collagenase-induced experimental model of ICH in adult mice. Daily oral administration of Am 80 (5 [*]mg/kg) starting from 1 day before or from up to 6 hours after intrastriatal injection of collagenase significantly inhibited the {{decrease in the number of}} striatal neurons at 3 days after the insult. Am 80 showed no significant effect on the hematoma size and the extent of edema associated with hemorrhage. Prominent expression of RARα was observed in activated microglia/macrophages, and the number of activated microglia/macrophages in the perihematoma region was lower in Am 80 -treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice. Am 80 treatment also reduced areas affected by hemorrhage-associated oxidative stress as indicated by nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity, and attenuated heme oxygenase- 1 expression in activated microglia/macrophages. Moreover, Am 80 -treated mice exhibited better recovery from hemorrhage-induced neurologic deficits than vehicle-treated mice. These results suggest that RAR is a promising target of neuroprotective therapy for ICH...|$|E
40|$|Stra 8 encodes {{stimulated by}} retinoic acid gene 8, a protein that is {{important}} for initiation of meiosis in mammals and birds. This study was aimed at identifying the active control area of chicken STRA 8 gene core promoter, to screen optimum inducers of the STRA 8 gene, thus to enhance the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into spermatogonial stem cells. Fragments of chicken STRA 8 gene promoter were cloned into fluorescent reporter plasmids and transfected into DF- 1 cells. Then Dual-Luciferase 1 Reporter Assay System was used to identify {{the activity of the}} STRA 8 gene under different inducers. Our studies showed that the promoter fragment − 1055 bp to + 54 bp of Suqin chicken Stra 8 revealed the strongest activity. The dual-luciferase 1 reporter showed that <b>Tamibarotene</b> (Am 80) and TrichostatinA (TSA) could significantly enhance STRA 8 transcription. The in vitro inductive culture of chicken ESCs demonstrated that spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) -like cells appeared and Integrinβ 1 protein was expressed on day 10, indicating that Am 80 and TSA can promote ESCs differentiation into SSCs via regulation of Stra 8...|$|E
40|$|Idarubicin (IDR), {{cytarabine}} (AraC), and <b>tamibarotene</b> (Am 80) {{are effective}} {{for treatment of}} acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In acute leukemia, the incidence of venous thromboembolism or disseminated intravascular coagulation is associated with induction chemotherapy. Procoagulant effects of IDR, AraC, and Am 80 were investigated in a vascular endothelial cell line EAhy 926 and AML cell lines HL 60 (AML M 2), NB 4 (AML M 3, APL), and U 937 (AML M 5), focusing on tissue factor (TF), phosphatidylserine (PS), and thrombomodulin (TM). IDR induced procoagulant activity {{on the surface of}} vascular endothelial and AML cell lines. Expression of TF antigen, TM antigen, and PS were induced by IDR on the surface of each cell line, whereas expression of TF and TM mRNAs were unchanged. Conversely, Am 80 decreased TF exposure and procoagulant activity, and increased TM exposure on NB 4 cells. In NB 4 cells, we observed downregulation of TF mRNA and upregulation of TM mRNA. These data suggest IDR may induce procoagulant activity in vessels by apoptosis through PS exposure and/or TF expression on vascular endothelial and AML cell lines. Am 80 may suppress blood coagulation through downregulation of TF expression and induction of TM expression. Our methods could be useful to investigate changes in procoagulant activity induced by antineoplastic drugs...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{trials for}} {{treatment}} of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) using all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) have shown satisfactory therapeutic responses, although efficacies were limited. Recently, many synthetic retinoids have been developed and among them, a novel synthetic retinoid, Am 80 (<b>Tamibarotene)</b> is an RARα- and RARβ-specific retinoid expected to overcome ATRA resistance. The present study examined the inhibitory effects of Am 80 on HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and ATL cells. Am 80 had negligible growth inhibition of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} but marked growth inhibition of both HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and ATL cells. Am 80 arrested cells in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle and induced apoptosis in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines. It inhibited also the phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB-DNA binding, in conjunction with reduction of expression of proteins involved in the G 1 /S cell cycle transition and apoptosis. Am 80 also inhibited the expression of JunD, resulting in suppression of AP- 1 -DNA binding. Furthermore, severe combined immunodeficient mice with tumors induced by subcutaneous inoculation of HTLV-I-infected T cells, responded to Am 80 treatment with partial regression of tumors and no side-effects. These findings demonstrate that Am 80 is a potential inhibitor of NF-κB and AP- 1, and is a potentially useful therapeutic agent against ATL. (Cancer Sci 2008; 99 : 2286 – 2294...|$|E
