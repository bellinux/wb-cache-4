500|$|After the war, {{many former}} Nazis fled to South America, {{especially}} to Argentina, {{where they were}} welcomed by Juan Perón's regime. In the 1950s, former Dachau inmate Lothar Hermann discovered that Buenos Aires resident Ricardo Klement was in fact Adolf Eichmann, who had in 1948 obtained false identification and a landing permit for Argentina through an organization directed by Bishop Alois Hudal, an Austrian cleric with Nazi sympathies then residing in Italy. Eichmann was captured in Buenos Aires on 11 May 1960 by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. At his trial in Jerusalem in 1961, he was found guilty {{and sentenced to death}} by hanging. Eichmann was quoted as having stated, [...] "I will jump into my grave laughing, because the fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> death of five million Jews [...] on my conscience gives me extraordinary satisfaction." [...] Franz Stangl, the commandant of Treblinka, also escaped to South America with the assistance of Hudal's network. He was deported to Germany in 1967 and was {{sentenced to life in prison}} in 1970. He died in 1971.|$|E
500|$|Davis toured relentlessly for {{two years}} while tolerating intense {{physical}} pain and difficulty walking, caused by joint pain from sickle-cell anaemia, badly damaged ankles after a 1972 car wreck, and osteoporosis in his left hip, which had been operated on a decade earlier. He had also developed nodules on his larynx that often left him short of breath, especially when playing the trumpet. To numb the pain, he became increasingly dependent on self-medicating with painkillers, cocaine, and morphine, which combined with his alcohol and recreational drug use led to mood swings; he would by turns feel vulnerable and hostile. By the end of 1974, a disappointing showing in Down Beat magazine's readers poll reinforced to Davis that his reputation had diminished. Unfazed by detractors and personal troubles, he kept his touring schedule intense. [...] "He was like the general looking at the fort {{and they had a}} moat {{and we were going to}} get in that fort", Henderson later said. [...] "That was the attitude of the band. We didn't give a shit what the critics said. People are gonna like what they like, but if you don't like it, respect it. Respect <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to do what I do. Because with or without you, we're going to do it anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|The National Black Police Association {{opposed the}} boycott of Time-Warner and {{the attacks on}} [...] "Cop Killer," [...] {{identifying}} police brutality {{as the cause of}} much anti-police sentiment, and proposed the creation of independent civilian review boards [...] "to scrutinize the actions of our law enforcement officers" [...] as a way of ending the provocations that caused artists such as Body Count [...] "to respond to actions of police brutality and abuse through their music. [...] Many individuals of the law enforcement profession do not want anyone to scrutinize their actions, but want to scrutinize the actions of others." [...] Critics argued that the song could cause crime and violence. Others defended the album {{on the basis of the}} group's right to freedom of speech, and cited the fact that Ice-T had portrayed a police officer in the film New Jack City. Ice-T is quoted as saying that [...] "I didn't need people to come in and really back me on the First Amendment. I needed people to come in and say 'Ice-T has grounds to make this record.' I have the right to make it because the cops are killing my people. So fuck the First Amendment, let's deal with the fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to make it." ...|$|E

500|$|Starting with Madonna's voice multi-tracked {{questioning}} – [...] "Am I gonna be a star?", [...] "Should I {{change my}} name?" [...] – the lyrics develop into what Rikky Rooksby of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna {{states is a}} complaint about modern-day life. She also questions the shallowness of modern life and the [...] "American dream." [...] "I know it sounds clichéd," [...] she admitted. [...] "But I've had 20 years of fame and fortune, and I feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to an opinion on {{what it is and}} isn't. All everyone is obsessed about now is being a celebrity. I'm saying that's bullshit, and who knows better than me? Before it happens, you have all kinds of notions about how wonderful celebrity is and how much joy it's going to bring you. Then you arrive... In America, more than any other place in the world, you have the freedom to be anything you want to be. Which is all well and good, but it only works if you have a value system – and we seem not to have one anymore. It's, 'Whatever it takes to get to the top, that's what you gotta do.' It's the allure of the beautiful life: 'Look like this, you're gonna be happy. Drive this car, you're gonna be popular. Wear these clothes and people are gonna want to fuck you.' It's a very powerful illusion and people are caught up in it, including myself. Or I was." ...|$|E
500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants {{you to have a}} purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able to}} get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> purpose that John had".|$|E
