5|$|The pilots {{later said}} they {{attempted}} the assassination {{in response to}} Diệm's autocratic rule, in which he focused more on remaining in power than on confronting the Vietcong, a Marxist–Leninist guerilla army who were threatening to overthrow the South Vietnamese government. Cử and Quốc hoped that the airstrike would expose Diệm's vulnerability and <b>trigger</b> <b>a</b> general uprising, but this failed to materialise.|$|E
5|$|Where {{reflexes}} of the Old Irish fortis sonorants {{appear in}} syllable-final position (in some cases, only in word-final position), they <b>trigger</b> <b>a</b> lengthening or diphthongization {{of the preceding}} vowel in most dialects of Irish.

50|$|Hering made {{significant}} contributions to the field of physiology as well as psychology. In particular he demonstrated with his student Breuer the Hering-Breuer reflex, or that artificially inflating the lungs <b>triggers</b> <b>an</b> automatic signal <b>triggering</b> expiration. Then deflating the lungs in turns <b>triggers</b> <b>a</b> new signal inducing respiration. I.e. inspirations and expirations are an endless reflex loop triggering each other. He also showed the Traube-Hering reflex, or that inflating the lungs <b>triggers</b> <b>an</b> acceleration of the heart.|$|R
5|$|Bona Allen saddles were {{available}} through the Sears mail order catalog, and many Hollywood actors used saddles made by the Bona Allen Company, including cowboy actors Gene Autry, the cast of Bonanza, and Roy Rogers, who used a Bona Allen saddle on his horse <b>Trigger.</b> <b>A</b> statue of Roy Rogers and a Bona Allen saddle-maker saddling Trigger is located in downtown Buford. The Bona Allen Company thrived during the Great Depression in the 1930s, likely {{as a result of}} the Depression forcing farmers to choose horses over expensive tractors, thereby increasing the demand for saddles, collars, bridles, and other leather products.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} can summon a specific Eidolon into battle. These summoned creatures include series staples Odin, Shiva, Alexander, and Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr. When summoned, the Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party. While an Eidolon is summoned, the player can <b>trigger</b> <b>a</b> feature called Gestalt Mode, {{in which the}} Eidolon transforms into a different form and performs different attacks while the summoning character rides them.|$|E
5|$|Flies tend {{to fly in}} a {{straight}} line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn. Detecting this within four or five wingbeats, the halteres <b>trigger</b> <b>a</b> counter-turn and the fly heads off in a new direction.|$|E

5|$|For anejaculation in SCI, the {{first-line}} {{method for}} sperm retrieval is penile vibratory stimulation (PVS). A high-speed vibrator {{is applied to}} the glans penis to <b>trigger</b> <b>a</b> reflex that causes ejaculation, usually within a few minutes. Reports of efficacy with PVS range from 15–88%, possibly due to differences in vibrator settings and experience of clinicians, as well as level and completeness of injury. Complete lesions strictly above Onuf's nucleus (S2–S4) are responsive to PVS in 98%, but complete lesions of the S2–S4 segments are not.|$|E
5|$|German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg {{encouraged}} this activity. The {{effort was}} led by prominent archaeologist and historian Max von Oppenheim, who headed the new Intelligence Bureau for the East and formed the Berlin Committee, which was later renamed the Indian Independence Committee. The Berlin Committee offered money, arms, and military advisors according to plans made by the German Foreign Office and Indian revolutionaries-in-exile such {{as members of the}} Ghadar Party in North America. The planners hoped to <b>trigger</b> <b>a</b> nationalist rebellion using clandestine shipments of men and arms sent to India from elsewhere in Asia and from the United States.|$|E
5|$|Given an {{adequate}} supply of food, larvae pupate and weave silken cocoons after three larval stages. Within the cocoon, the larva moults {{for a final}} time and undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form. This can take just four days, but may take much longer under adverse conditions, and there follows a variable-length stage during which the pre-emergent adult awaits a suitable opportunity to emerge. Trigger factors for emergence include vibrations (including sound), heat (in warm-blooded hosts), and increased levels of carbon dioxide, all of which stimuli may indicate {{the presence of a}} suitable host. Large numbers of pre-emergent fleas may be present in otherwise flea-free environments, and the introduction of a suitable host may <b>trigger</b> <b>a</b> mass emergence.|$|E

5|$|Starburst {{galaxies are}} {{characterized}} by dusty concentrations of gas {{and the appearance of}} newly formed stars, including massive stars that ionize the surrounding clouds to create H II regions. These massive stars produce supernova explosions, resulting in expanding remnants that interact powerfully with the surrounding gas. These outbursts <b>trigger</b> <b>a</b> chain reaction of star building that spreads throughout the gaseous region. Only when the available gas is nearly consumed or dispersed does the starburst activity end.|$|E

Each character is given two actions per turn, with one physical and one magical attack per character.
