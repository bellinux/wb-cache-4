60|$|In the Collector's pockets {{they found}} a twist of tobacco, a red {{bandanna}} handkerchief of violent color, a purse meagrely filled with copper coins and silver pieces, a silver watch still ticking with a loud and insistent iteration, a piece of <b>tarred</b> <b>string,</b> and a clasp-knife.|$|E
60|$|And out {{struggle}} a {{piece of}} <b>tarred</b> <b>string,</b> a bundle of papers, a thimble, {{a piece of}} pudding-tobacco, and last of all, a little paper of Muscovado sugar--then as great a delicacy as any French bonbons would be now--which he thrusts into the old man's eager and trembling hand.|$|E
50|$|Mirza Sadig (SadÄ±qcan), born Sadig Asadoglu (1846, Shusha - 1902, Shusha), was an Azerbaijani tar-player (sazanda) {{known for}} {{developing}} the Azeri tar (or Caucasus <b>tar</b> or 11 <b>string</b> <b>tar)</b> from the Iranian tar.|$|R
5000|$|For most of {{his life}} Zahoor {{performed}} mainly in dargahs (Sufi tombs/shrines) and festivals, and in the streets. He adopted the folk instrument Ektara (ek= one, <b>tar</b> = <b>string),</b> in its three-stringed version called Tumbi, as his main instrument. Like some traditions of Sufi music, he has a passionate, high-energy style of singing, often dancing in a frenzied style with the tassels on his instrument whirling around him. His typical outfit includes embroidered (kurta), beads, tightly bound turban, as well as ghungroos (anklet-bells worn by dancers). His voice has an earthy tone, almost cracking at the edges, but capable of a wide vocal and emotional range. [...] "His piercing chiseled features are a regular sight on Pakistani TV and he {{has been the subject of}} at least one documentary." ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} 1870s, Sadig used the {{traditional}} Persian tar {{to develop the}} new version of this instrument, which later {{became known as the}} Azeri tar or the Caucasus tar. The Persian tar has 6 steel strings in 3 double-courses (the low one in octave). The Azeri tar invented by Sadig has further one extra bass-string on the side, on a raised nut, and usually 2 double resonance strings via small metal nuts halfway the neck. All these strings are running next to the main strings over the bridge and are fixed to a string-holder and the edge of the body. Overall the Azeri <b>tar</b> has 11 <b>strings</b> and 17 tones.|$|R
6000|$|But, in the meanwhile, {{there are}} animals in which results so strange, fantastic, even {{seemingly}} horrible, are produced, that fallen man may be pardoned, if he shrinks {{from them in}} disgust. [...] That, at least, must be a consequence of our own wrong state; for everything is beautiful and perfect in its place. It may be answered, [...] "Yes, in its place; but its place is not yours. You had no business to look at it, and must pay the penalty for intermeddling." [...] I doubt that answer; for surely, if man have liberty to do anything, he has liberty to search out freely his heavenly Father's works; and yet every one seems to have his antipathic animal; and I know one bred from his childhood to zoology by land and sea, and bold in asserting, and honest in feeling, that all without exception is beautiful, who yet cannot, after handling and petting and admiring all day long every uncouth and venomous beast, avoid a paroxysm of horror {{at the sight of}} the common house-spider. At all events, whether we were intruding or not, in turning this stone, we must pay a fine for having done so; for there lies an animal as foul and monstrous to the eye as [...] "hydra, gorgon, or chimaera dire," [...] and yet so wondrously fitted to its work, that we must needs endure for our own instruction to handle and to look at it. Its name, if you wish for it, is Nemertes; probably N. Borlasii; (18) a worm of very [...] "low" [...] organization, though well fitted enough for its own work. You see it? That black, shiny, knotted lump among the gravel, small enough to be taken up in a dessert spoon. Look now, as it is raised and its coils drawn out. Three feet - six - nine, at least: with a capability of seemingly endless expansion; a slimy tape of living caoutchouc, some eighth of an inch in diameter, a dark chocolate- black, with paler longitudinal lines. Is it alive? It hangs, helpless and motionless, a mere velvet string across the hand. Ask the neighbouring Annelids and the fry of the rock fishes, or put it into a vase at home, and see. It lies motionless, trailing itself among the gravel; you cannot tell where it begins or ends; it may be a dead strip of sea-weed, Himanthalia lorea, perhaps, or Chorda filum; or even a <b>tarred</b> <b>string.</b> So thinks the little fish who plays over and over it, till he touches at last what is too surely a head. In an instant a bell-shaped sucker mouth has fastened to his side. In another instant, from one lip, a concave double proboscis, just like a tapir's (another instance of the repetition of forms), has clasped him like a finger; and now begins the struggle: but in vain. He is being [...] "played" [...] with such a fishing- line as the skill of a Wilson or a Stoddart never could invent; a living line, with elasticity beyond that of the most delicate fly- rod, which follows every lunge, shortening and lengthening, slipping and twining round every piece of gravel and stem of sea- weed, with a tiring drag such as no Highland wrist or step could ever bring to bear on salmon or on trout. The victim is tired now; and slowly, and yet dexterously, his blind assailant is feeling and shifting along his side, till he reaches one end of him; and then the black lips expand, and slowly and surely the curved finger begins packing him end-foremost down into the gullet, where he sinks, inch by inch, till the swelling which marks his place is lost among the coils, and he is probably macerated to a pulp long before he has reached the opposite extremity of his cave of doom. [...] Once safe down, the black murderer slowly contracts again into a knotted heap, and lies, like a boa with a stag inside him, motionless and blest. (19) ...|$|E
50|$|Whereas the British naval cat rarely cut (contrary to graphic films) {{but rather}} abraded the skin, the falls (tresses) of the British Army cat were lighter (around 1/8th of an inch) and the string {{was in fact}} codline - a very dense {{material}} akin to <b>tarred</b> <b>string.</b> Although the total whip would weigh {{only a fraction of}} a naval rope cat, the thin, dense codline tresses were far more likely to cut the skin.|$|E
50|$|Modern reeds {{are made}} by placing {{flattened}} strips of wire (made of carbon or stainless steel) between two half round ribs of wood, and binding the whole together with <b>tarred</b> <b>string.</b> Historically reeds were made of reed or cane, however modern reeds are made of metal wires. John Kay in 1738 first used flattened iron or brass wire, and the change was quickly adopted. Previously the cane was split by pressing it against a spindle that had knives radiating out {{of it at the}} appropriate distance apart. The split cane was then bound between the ribs of wood {{in the same manner as}} the wire is now.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Azerbaijani tar" [...] or [...] "11 string tar" [...] is an {{instrument}} {{in a slightly}} different shape from the Persian Tar and was developed from the Persian tar around 1870 by Sadigjan. It has a slightly different build and has more <b>strings.</b> The Caucasus <b>tar</b> has further one extra bass-string on the side, on a raised nut, and usually 2 double resonance strings via small metal nuts halfway the neck. All these strings are running next to the main strings over the bridge and are fixed to a string-holder and the edge of the body. Overall the Caucasus <b>tar</b> has 11 <b>strings</b> and 17 tones.|$|R
