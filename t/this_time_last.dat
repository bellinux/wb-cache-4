500|$|Even before {{viewing the}} script, Reznor and Ross opted {{to use a}} redolent {{approach}} to creating the film's score. After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions, the duo spent six weeks composing. [...] "We composed music we felt might belong," [...] stated the Nine Inch Nails lead vocalist, [...] "and then we'd run it by Fincher, to see where his head’s at and he responded positively. He was filming at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>last</b> year and assembling rough edits of scenes {{to see what it}} feels like, and he was inserting our music at that point, rather than using temp music, which is how it usually takes place, apparently." [...] Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. [...] "We weren’t working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work. It was a lesson we learned pretty quickly of, 'Everything is in flux, and approach it as such. Hopefully it’ll work out in the end.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In November, Gillan {{revealed}} that the film was undergoing reshoots. That February, {{it was reported that}} the film had scored a perfect 100 in test screenings, the highest for any Marvel Studios film. The Hollywood Reporter noted this score could not necessarily be compared to any non-Marvel movies due to Marvel's specific testing process that selects its audience [...] "from a more select pool of recruits, what it terms 'friends and families screenings'". In March 2017, Gunn {{revealed that}} Michael Rosenbaum would appear in the film, and that Gunn would provide reference for Baby Groot's dancing [...] "in a much bigger way [...] I actually had to do like a full day's worth of dancing to get Groot's dance down <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Last</b> time it was me in front of an iPhone, and this time it's me dancing on a huge soundstage and shooting it from five different angles." [...] Fred Raskin and Craig Wood returned from the first film to serve as editors. On scenes that were cut from the film, Gunn said Nathan Fillion, who had had a voice cameo in the first film, was going to appear as Simon Williams in a sequence that would have shown several movie posters for films starring Williams, including films in which he portrays Arkon and Tony Stark. Gunn chose Williams for Fillion's cameo because he wanted Fillion to have a bigger role in the MCU at some point and so didn't want to give him a role that could prevent him from taking a more substantial one later. Gunn still considered Fillion's cameo canon to the MCU, despite it being cut. He also confirmed that Close's scenes had been cut from the film, because it felt like he [...] "was trying to cram Nova Prime into the second movie as opposed to having it happen organically." ...|$|E
