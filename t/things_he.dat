His accounts of about 35 animals are sufficiently detailed to convince biologists that he dissected those species, indeed vivisecting some; he mentions the internal anatomy of roughly 110 animals in total.|$|E

5|$|Branham's {{father was}} an alcoholic, and William Branham often talked about how his {{upbringing}} was difficult and impoverished. As a child, he would often wear a coat, held closed by safety pins, without a shirt underneath. Some have called his claims of poverty into question, because, among other <b>things,</b> <b>he</b> was able to purchase a new car when he was 18 years old.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Reines {{exhibited}} {{an interest in}} science, and liked creating and building <b>things.</b> <b>He</b> later recalled that: The first stirrings of interest in science that I remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school, when, looking {{out of the window}} at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope, I noticed something peculiar about the light; it was the phenomenon of diffraction. That began for me a fascination with light.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the War of the First Coalition Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. With {{military}} rations unable to satisfy his large appetite, he would eat any available food from gutters and refuse heaps but his condition still deteriorated through hunger. Suffering from exhaustion, he was hospitalised and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity, in which, among other <b>things,</b> <b>he</b> ate a meal intended for 15 people in a single sitting, ate live cats, snakes, lizards and puppies, and swallowed an eel whole without chewing. Despite his unusual diet, he was of normal size and appearance, and showed no signs of mental illness other than what was described as an apathetic temperament.|$|E
5|$|Early in 197BC, Flamininus summoned Attalus to {{join him}} at Elateia (now in Roman hands) and from there they {{traveled}} together to attend a Boeotian council in Thebes to discuss which side Boeotia would take in the war. At the council Attalus spoke first, reminding the Boeotians of the many <b>things</b> <b>he</b> and his ancestors had done for them, but during his address he stopped talking and collapsed, with {{one side of his}} body paralyzed. Attalus was taken back to Pergamon, where he died {{around the time of the}} Battle of Cynoscephalae, which brought about the end of the Second Macedonian War.|$|E
5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful <b>things.</b> <b>He</b> walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E
50|$|Ace {{wrote one}} screenplay, I Married a Woman, in 1957. Calling {{it the best}} <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> had ever written, but the worst <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> had ever seen after viewing the film, Ace never tried his hand at screenwriting again. When the couple's Miami hotel room was robbed in 1966, Ace managed to find humor in the situation.|$|R

5|$|In February 2011, Fletcher filed {{a lawsuit}} against the Board of Directors of The Dakota co-op {{building}} in Manhattan, where he had lived since 1992 and owned four apartments. Among other <b>things,</b> <b>he</b> alleged defamation and unlawful discrimination. In March 2010, Fletcher had signed a contract to purchase a fifth apartment at The Dakota, intending to combine it with his current home. The Dakota board said it rejected Fletcher's application based on the financial materials he provided in his application. Judge Eileen A. Rakower dismissed the suit in September 2015 and Fletcher announced his intention to appeal.|$|E

He tried to {{convince}} them that peace with the United States was in their best interests, and that war against them was futile, stressing their dominant military capabilities. Many Mohave were skeptical of his reports, and reacted with disbelief.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} difference between the community components in Miami and California was that both Los Angeles and San Francisco had very active and visible gay communities. Founder of Metropolitan Community Church Reverend Troy Perry, who {{began his career as a}} charismatic preacher in the Church of God of Prophecy but was rejected for being gay, went on a 16-day fast to raise $100,000 and succeeded. Hollywood stars Bette Midler, Lily Tomlin, and Richard Pryor came out in force for the cause, raising another $100,000. In January 1978 Harvey Milk took office as a supervisor of San Francisco, and the first openly gay man to be elected to office in California. Briggs campaigned for the measure throughout the state, and held a series of public and televised debates with Milk who was very well received by the media, quick to quip and give print-friendly comments. He often made the front page in newspapers in San Francisco with the outrageous <b>things</b> <b>he</b> said. Milk spoke to 350,000 participants of 1978's San Francisco Gay Freedom Day; similar numbers were seen in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|At the mall, Michael {{opens to}} the women about his {{discomfort}} with Jan.

All the women assure Michael that Jan's behavior is not normal and urge {{him to get out}} of the relationship. He remains conflicted about what he should do about Jan, but at Phyllis's prompting he finally admits to himself that he wants to break up with her. Michael thanks them for their help by treating them to one item each at Victoria's Secret. On the drive back, Pam takes a step toward asserting herself by changing a flat tire on Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) car. At the office, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) sneaks in{{to the women}}'s bathroom and discovers a plush waiting room. The other men soon join him.|$|E

60|$|To a {{man like}} Paul Déroulède, a man of thought, of purpose, and of action, {{the idea of being}} false to the thing loved, of hate and love being interchangeable, was {{absolutely}} foreign and unbelievable.

5|$|Elle {{manages to}} {{convince}} Paul to sign over {{his share of}} Lassiter's {{to her and she}} leaves him with nothing. Paul has a brain tumour removed and he loses his memory.

5|$|Homer {{decides to}} take his family to the new sushi bar, The Happy Sumo. After {{sampling}} most of {{the items on the}} menu, he tries sushi made from fugu. The chef in charge is busy making love with Edna, so his apprentice has to slice the fish, of which certain parts are toxic. He tries to do it carefully, but Homer becomes impatient, only to have it served and become unsure if the poisonous portions have been removed. Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and believes that the fish has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer that he may have been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that based on a chat he had with the sushi chef, Homer is found out that he has increased likeliness of death and has 22 hours left to live. At night with Marge by his side, he decides not to tell his children about the bad news and makes {{a list of all the}} <b>things</b> <b>he</b> wants to do before death.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 24September that Edward left Acre. Arriving in Sicily, he was met {{with the news that}} his father had died on 16November, 1272. Edward was deeply saddened by this news, but rather than hurrying home at once, he made a leisurely journey northwards. This was due partly to his still-poor health, but also to a lack of urgency. The {{political}} situation in England was stable after the mid-century upheavals, and Edward was proclaimed king at his father's death, rather than at his own coronation, as had until then been customary. In Edward's absence, the country was governed by a royal council, led by Robert Burnell. The new king embarked on an overland journey through Italy and France, where among other <b>things</b> <b>he</b> visited Pope Gregory X. Only on 2 August 1274 did he return to England, and he was crowned on 19 August.|$|E
