The bill also allowed judges to sentence criminals to life without parole; previously, life without parole for 25years had been the harshest non-capital sentence. The bill passed the legislature in 1999.|$|E

40|$|The <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> handles {{thousands}} of cases involving juvenile victims each year.

2500|$|Leslie Jackson appealed his indictment. His {{attorneys}} argued that, under Ohio law, a Juvenile Court {{was required}} to find a juvenile delinquent, as well as determine that the juvenile could not be rehabilitated under <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system,</b> before that juvenile could {{be turned over to}} the Court of Common Pleas for indictment as an adult. His case went to the Supreme Court of Ohio, which in 1970 nullified the indictments against him in In re Jackson, 21 Ohio St.2d 215 (Ohio 1970). The ruling had the effect of nullifying Hardrick's indictments as well. Hardrick and Jackson were then charged with delinquency for wounding Lt. Elmer Joseph during the shootout. Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Charles R. Laurie declined to have the pair re-indicted by the Court of Common Pleas, as the two [...] "were not ring leaders and besides, many key witnesses are no longer available." [...] After hearing evidence that a rifle used by the two was employed to wound Lt. Joseph, Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court Judge Walter G. Whitlatch sentenced Hardrick and Jackson to the Mansfield Youth Center in Mansfield, Ohio. Both individuals were to be released on their 21st birthday.|$|E

Balancing her new job, her family, and trying to rebuild her love life is not easy, but she keeps trying. She makes a name for herself in family court for her unusual methods and sentences and her stubbornness, which sometimes gets her in trouble. She dates several men. Her longest and more serious relationships are with lawyer Stuart Collins and David McClaren. Amy and Stuart dislike each other at first, but when she asks him to be Eric Black's lawyer, they get closer and eventually get engaged. However, Amy leaves him at the altar on their wedding day, saying he has a way of always convincing her to do things she does not want to do, calling him [...] "a bully". She meets David McClaren during her short stint in the criminal court, and things are rocky from the start. Amy becomes pregnant by him and they plan to marry, but things fall apart when she miscarries and they part ways soon thereafter. In the last episode of the series, she quits the judiciary to run for Senate, to try to prevent the passage of a law that will effectively end <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> by allowing the State's Attorney's office to try teenagers as adults at their own discretion. Amy's often complicated and ever changing definition of a relationship with her Court Services Officer, Bruce Van Exel, whom she calls her [...] "best friend" [...] and with whom she's shared intimate moments – despite his refusal to date white women, ends with him coming to be with her in Washington as she testifies at a Senate Hearing.|$|E

40|$|The {{rights of}} {{children}} {{in conflict with the}} law has always been a central subject of <b>juvenile</b> <b>justice</b> which attracts an intense academic, political and media interest and debate. In this respect, the United Nations Convention on Rights of Children (CRC), which was adopted on 20 th November 1989, has laid down international standards and legal framework on rights of children under <b>juvenile</b> <b>justice.</b> <b>The</b> CRC’s standards on this matter have served as a useful guideline and benchmark to state parties in determining and assessing the rights {{of children in}} criminal proceedings. As a country that has ratified the CRC in 1995, Malaysia is duty-bound to strive towards full implementation of the requirements of the CRC. This study will specifically focus on examining the legal rights of children in criminal proceedings under both the CRC’s standards and <b>the</b> Malaysian <b>juvenile</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system.</b> Using <b>the</b> CRC’s standards as a guideline and a benchmark, the study aims to assess the rights of children in criminal proceedings under <b>the</b> current Malaysian <b>juvenile</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system.</b> <b>The</b> study will attempt to critically and comparatively analyze to what extent <b>the</b> Malaysian <b>juvenile</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> on <b>the</b> rights of children in criminal proceedings measure up with the CRC’s standards.
