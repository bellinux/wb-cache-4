5|$|Austria: Three {{specimens}} of M.alcathoe {{were recorded in}} Burgenland, southeastern Austria, in 2006. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> near fishponds in a region dominated by oak (Quercus petraea) and hornbeam (Carpinus betulus).|$|E
5|$|In 1963 forty four prisoners escaped in a well-planned break-out, {{but most}} were quickly recaptured, {{handicapped}} by their weakened physical condition. In 1969 a guard helped {{two members of the}} royal family escape, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> after a few days. The prison was closed in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the fleet}} crossed to Thasos, {{resulting}} in the Thasians submitting to the Persians. The fleet then rounded the coastline as far as Acanthus in Chalcidice, before attempting to round the headland of Mount Athos. However, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> in a violent storm, which drove them against the coastline of Athos, wrecking (according to Herodotus) 300 ships, {{with the loss of}} 20,000 men.|$|E

40|$|This paper argues that, {{while the}} {{existence}} of strong moral dilemmas is notoriously controversial, a {{case can be made}} for {{the existence of}} mild dilemmas. It is common for people to feel that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>caught</b> in some type of moral dilemma. If mild dilemmas are a genuine feature of the moral terrain, perceptions by ordinary people that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>caught</b> in a moral dilemma are to some extent vindicated...|$|R

5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, and was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined hosts which soon arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment. The first group, under Peter the Hermit, he sent to Asia Minor, ordering them to stay close to the coast and await reinforcements. However, the unruly crusaders refused to listen and began looting and pillaging the local Christian inhabitants. As they marched on Nicaea in 1096, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> by the Turks and massacred almost to the man.|$|E
5|$|Japanese forces {{landed in}} Miri on 16 December 1941. They conquered Kuching on 24 December 1941. On 25 December 1941, Sibu was bombed by 9 Japanese warplanes flown from Kuching. The Resident of Third Division, Andrew Macpherson {{believed}} that the Japanese would start to invade Sibu following the air attack. He and his officer later fled Sibu to the upstream of Rajang River. They planned to pass through Batang Ai and trek through the forests to reach Dutch Borneo. However, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> and killed by the Japanese at Ulu Moyan, Sarawak.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the other}} senior {{officers}} in the Armed Forces Council were not so lucky, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> by Phát's troops inside headquarters, while other buildings of the military complex remained under junta control. Khánh managed to escape to Vũng Tàu. His plane was just emerging from the hangar and lifted off just as rebel tanks were rolling in, attempting to block the runway and shut down the airport. Phát's ground troops also missed capturing Kỳ, who fled through the streets in a sports car {{with his wife and}} mother-in-law. Kỳ ended up at Tân Sơn Nhất, where he ran into Khánh; the pair flew off together to regroup.|$|E

5|$|The Muhammad al-Durrah {{incident}} {{took place}} in the Gaza Strip on 30 September 2000, {{on the second day of}} the Second Intifada, during widespread rioting throughout the Palestinian territories. Jamal al-Durrah and his 12-year-old son, Muhammad, were filmed by Talal Abu Rahma, a Palestinian cameraman freelancing for France 2, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> in crossfire between Israeli and Palestinian security forces. The footage shows the pair crouching behind a concrete cylinder, the boy crying and the father waving, then a burst of gunfire and dust, after which the boy is seen slumped across his father's legs.|$|E
5|$|The {{restoration}} {{of relations with}} Galicia had an immediate benefit for Manuel when, in 1166, he dispatched two armies to attack the eastern provinces of Hungary in a vast pincer movement. One army crossed the Walachian Plain and entered Hungary through the Transylvanian Alps (Southern Carpathians), while the other army made a wide circuit to Galicia and, with Galician aid, crossed the Carpathian Mountains. Since the Hungarians had most of their forces concentrated on the Sirmium and Belgrade frontier, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> off guard by the Byzantine invasion; this resulted in the Hungarian province of Transylvania being thoroughly ravaged by the Byzantine armies.|$|E
5|$|After Manzikert, {{a partial}} {{recovery}} (referred {{to as the}} Komnenian restoration) {{was made possible by}} the Komnenian dynasty. The first Komnenian emperor was Isaac I (1057–1059), after which the Doukas dynasty held power (1059–81). The Komnenoi attained power again under Alexios I in 1081. From the outset of his reign, Alexios faced a formidable attack by the Normans under Robert Guiscard and his son Bohemund of Taranto, who captured Dyrrhachium and Corfu, and laid siege to Larissa in Thessaly. Robert Guiscard's death in 1085 temporarily eased the Norman problem. The following year, the Seljuq sultan died, and the sultanate was split by internal rivalries. By his own efforts, Alexios defeated the Pechenegs; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> by surprise and annihilated at the Battle of Levounion on 28 April 1091.|$|E

5|$|As {{the wine}} {{business}} began to prosper, Schnaufer also gave thought to alternative employment possibilities in peacetime aviation. With his wartime friend Hermann Greiner, he traveled from Weil am Rhein to Bern in Switzerland to meet South American diplomats; the two {{hoped to find}} employment as pilots in South America. To get to Bern, they crossed the Swiss-German border illegally. The meeting was a failure. As they returned to Germany, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> by Swiss border guards attempting to make a second illegal border crossing. The Swiss handed {{them over to the}} French occupation authorities and they were imprisoned in Lörrach, where they remained until Schnaufer managed to make contact with a French general, who was a customer of the Schnaufer winery and had them released. This misadventure kept him away from his business for about half a year.|$|E
5|$|Mercia {{had a long}} {{tradition}} of venerating royal saints and this was enthusiastically supported by Æthelred and Æthelflæd. Saintly relics were believed to give supernatural legitimacy to rulers' authority, and Æthelflæd was probably responsible for the foundation or re-foundation of Chester Minster and the transfer to it of the remains of the seventh-century Mercian princess Saint Werburgh from Hanbury in Staffordshire. She may also have translated the relics of the martyred Northumbrian prince Ealhmund from Derby to Shrewsbury. In 910 the Danes retaliated against the English attack of the previous year by invading Mercia, raiding as far as Bridgnorth in Shropshire. On their way back <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> by an English army in Staffordshire and their army was destroyed at the Battle of Tettenhall, opening the way for the recovery of the Danish Midlands and East Anglia over the next decade.|$|E
5|$|In {{boiler room}} No.4, at around 01:20, water began {{flooding}} in from below, possibly {{indicating that the}} bottom of the ship had also been holed by the iceberg. The flow of water soon overwhelmed the pumps and forced the firemen and trimmers to evacuate the forward boiler rooms. Further aft, Chief Engineer William Bell, his engineering colleagues, and a handful of volunteer firemen and greasers stayed behind in the unflooded No.1, 2 and 3 boiler rooms and in the turbine and reciprocating engine rooms. They continued working on the boilers and the electrical generators {{in order to keep the}} ship's lights and pumps operable and to power the radio so that distress signals could be sent. They remained at their posts until the very end, thus ensuring that Titanics electrics functioned until the final minutes of the sinking. None of the ship's 35 engineers and electricians survived. Neither did any of the Titanics five postal clerks, who were last seen struggling to save the mail bags they had rescued from the flooded mail room. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> by the rising water somewhere on D deck.|$|E

5|$|On August 15, the Egyptians {{launched}} an offensive from their major north-western base in Haradh. They had 1,000 troops and about 2,000 republicans. The plan, as interpreted by British intelligence, {{seemed to have}} been to cut the thirty-mile track southward through the mountains from the Saudi border at Khoubah to al-Badr's headquarters in the Qara mountains near Washa, and then to split into two task forces, one moving east through Washa to the headquarters and the other north-eastwards along the track to the Saudi border below the Razih mountains. The Egyptians began their move on Saturday morning, moving along the Haradh and Tashar ravines. On Saturday and Sunday afternoons <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> in heavy rain and their vehicles, including twenty tanks and about forty armored cars sank axle deep into the mud. The defenders left them alone until Monday at dawn. Al-Badr left his headquarters at three that morning with 1,000 men to direct a counterattack in the Tashar ravine, while Abdullah Hussein attacked in the Haradh ravine.|$|E
