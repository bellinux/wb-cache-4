5|$|Visual {{displays}} mostly {{occur in}} agonistic situations. Elephants {{will try to}} appear more threatening by raising <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> and spreading their ears. They may add to the display by shaking <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks. Submissive ones will lower <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> and trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their necks, while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a V shape.|$|E

5000|$|Upon two cards {{being placed}} {{consecutively}} on the pile that are identical, players have to touch or slightly slap <b>their</b> <b>head</b> before placing <b>their</b> {{hand on the}} top of the pile. Players who do not touch <b>their</b> <b>head</b> cannot claim the pile. If both players fail to touch <b>their</b> <b>head</b> then play continues. Players who touch <b>their</b> <b>head</b> pre-emptively lose the pile to the other player. Applying this rule often adds humor for both players and on-lookers. Alternative versions of the game include claiming cards simply by shouting [...] "Snap".|$|R
5|$|While seated {{upon the}} bare rocks I have often {{observed}} these little animals watching me, apparently {{with as much}} curiosity as I watched them, turning <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> {{from side to side}} as if in an effort to be wise. If I kept quiet for a few minutes they would creep up to me and finally upon me; if I moved, they ran down the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> above the edges to watch me.|$|E
5|$|A {{chattering}} {{sound is}} made by rapidly gnashing the teeth, and is generally a sign of warning. Guinea pigs tend to raise <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> when making this sound.|$|E
5|$|A {{version of}} this story {{circulating}} in 1836, recounted by Martineau, added that the slaves were emaciated, showed signs of being flayed with a whip, were bound in restrictive postures, and wore spiked iron collars which kept <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> in static positions.|$|E
50|$|The wrestler stands {{facing an}} upright opponent, lowers <b>their</b> <b>head</b> and then jumps or charges forwards, driving {{the top of}} <b>their</b> <b>head</b> into the abdomen of the opponent. There is also a double-team version of the move.|$|R
50|$|On January 11, 2009, the Denver Broncos named McDaniels <b>their</b> <b>head</b> coach, {{replacing}} Mike Shanahan. The Broncos introduced McDaniels, {{who agreed}} to sign a four-year, $8 million contract, as <b>their</b> <b>head</b> coach {{in a press conference}} the next day.|$|R
50|$|The head noun {{picture has}} the four dependents the, old, of Fred, and that I {{found in the}} drawer. The tree shows how the lighter dependents appear as pre-dependents (preceding <b>their</b> <b>head)</b> and the heavier ones as post-dependents (following <b>their</b> <b>head).</b>|$|R
5|$|A wet bell, or open bell, {{is similar}} to a diving stage in concept, but has an air space, open to the water at the bottom in which the divers, or at least <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> can shelter during ascent and descent.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mating}} season rival males may compete by wrestling, not by biting. Opponents attempt to subdue {{each other by}} intertwining their bodies and raising <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> high off the ground. Observers have on {{occasion}} mistaken such wrestling for mating.|$|E
5|$|Most birds cannot {{move their}} eyes, {{although}} there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes {{on the sides of}} <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.|$|E

5|$|The ezpatadantza and the makildantza ("stick dance") employs makila (traditional Basque walking sticks), {{and ends}} with the dancers raising one of them, lying as a fallen warrior, over <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|E
5|$|A 2014 {{study of}} falcons of {{different}} species (gyrfalcon, saker falcon, and peregrine falcon) used video cameras mounted on <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> or backs to track their approaches to prey. Comparison {{of the observed}} paths with simulations of different pursuit strategies showed that these predatory birds used a motion camouflage path consistent with CATD.|$|E

5|$|A flight {{behaviour}} {{in which}} a bird rapidly descends with a zig-zagging, side-slipping motion. During whiffling, some birds invert the aerodynamic mechanics of their body that normally provide lift—flying by turning their bodies upside down but with their necks twisted 180 degrees to keep <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> in a normal flying position—resulting in a rapid plummet, before a quick arrest of the fall by resuming a normal flying orientation.|$|E
5|$|Before World War One men {{generally}} had longer {{hair and}} beards. However, short hair on men {{was introduced in}} World War One for soldiers. Slaves and defeated armies were often required to shave <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b> The trench warfare in 1914 to 1918 exposed men to flea and lice infestations, which prompted the order to cut short hair, establishing a military tradition, and it expanded among civilians by imitation.|$|E
5|$|Captive {{killer whale}} lifespans are {{typically}} significantly shorter, usually less than 25 years; however, numerous individuals are alive in their 30s, {{and a few}} have reached their 40s. Killer whales are unique among cetaceans, as <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> become relatively shorter as they age, i.e., the orca's caudal section enlongates more-so relative to its head.|$|E

5|$|Catastrophic {{injuries}} {{have been}} on a steady decline since the 1960s, due in part to rules banning dangerous forms of contact such as spearing, face tackling and butt blocking. However, catastrophic injuries are still caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, as well when players hit <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> against an opposing player's knee or the ground. Returning to play after sustaining a head injury earlier in the game also places players at risk for an even more severe injury. Many states are requiring teams to prevent players who have shown any signs of a concussion from returning to a game, while other steps such as more aggressive enforcement of safety rules and better condition of the neck muscles have been suggested. Additionally, coaches are being urged to train players to block with their shoulders instead of <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand reluctantly ordered saps to be {{dug into}} the side of the mountain. The sapping was {{difficult}} and dangerous and the sappers worked under continuous attack from the castle's defenders, who fired on them with small arms and the castle's artillery and dropped rocks and debris on <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b> The forced labor of local peasants minimized losses among Ferdinand's own troops, but many of the peasants perished in the effort.|$|E
5|$|Following the drilling, a hole {{opens up}} in the object's {{interior}} wall. Inside, Quatermass and the others find the remains of insect-like aliens resembling giant three-legged locusts, with stubby antennae on <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> giving the impression of horns. As Quatermass and Roney examine the remains, they theorise the aliens {{may have come from}} a planet habitable five million years ago– Mars.|$|E
