5|$|The 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom are Tuvalu's second Summer Olympics {{following}} {{its debut in}} the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. Tuvalu sent their most number of athletes to any Olympic Games with three in their previous appearance. No <b>Tuvaluan</b> athlete had ever won a medal at the Olympic Games. Tuvalu participated in the London Summer Games from 27 July to 12 August 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Tuvalu Association of Sports and National Olympic Committee was {{recognised}} as a National Olympic Committee in July 2007. Tuvalu {{entered the}} Olympic Games {{for the first}} time at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, China, with a weightlifter and two athletes in the men's and women's 100-metre sprints. <b>Tuvaluan</b> athletes have yet to progress past the first round of their events.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Tuvaluans</b> {{benefited from}} the canned food {{supplied}} by the American forces, although the change in diet continued after the war, which resulted in long term impacts on health. <b>Tuvaluans</b> adopted a diet that includes high levels of corned beef, rice and sugar, consumed even when fish and traditional vegetables are available.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the colonial}} administration, <b>Tuvaluans</b> {{provided}} medical {{services at the}} hospital after receiving training at the Suva Medical School, which {{changed its name to}} Central Medical School in 1928 and which later became the Fiji School of Medicine. Training was provided to <b>Tuvaluans</b> who graduated with the title Native Medical Practitioners, nurses or [...] "dressers", the male equivalent of nurses.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tuvaluans</b> {{took part}} in the men's doubles in table tennis, and failed to reach the round of sixteen.|$|R
5|$|Logona Esau {{qualified}} for weightlifting via {{an invitation from}} the Tripartite commission. He represented Tuvalu as its first weightlifter, and its only competitor in the sport at the Beijing Games. He competed in the lightweight class. Born in the South Pacific island nation of Nauru in 1987, Esau was 21 {{years old at the}} time of his participation in his Beijing event. He was the most experienced and decorated of the three <b>Tuvaluan</b> athletes who came to Beijing's Olympic Games, having previously medaled in Oceanian international competitions. Logona Esau's event, which took place on August 12, included 30 athletes. He and New Zealand's Mark Spooner were the only competitors from Oceania in that particular competition. All of Esau's snatches were successful, and he lifted 102kilograms, 107kilograms, and 110kilograms successively. During the clean and jerks, Esau successfully lifted 138kilograms, then 144kilograms. He unsuccessfully attempted to lift 148kilograms. His total score, a combination of his highest snatch and clean and jerk lifts, was 254kilograms. This ranked the <b>Tuvaluan</b> in 23rd place out of the 24 athletes who finished the event. Tajikistan scored below Tuvalu at 250kilograms and Nepal scored immediately above at 268kilograms. In comparison, Liao Hui of China won the gold medal after lifting a combined 348kilograms.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Joni {{impacted}} {{the island}} nations of Tuvalu and Fiji, while it also threatened the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and the French territory of Wallis and Futuna. The {{majority of the}} <b>Tuvaluan</b> islands suffered minor damage from Joni, while in Fiji the system caused a moderate to severe amount of damage. Due {{to the impact of}} this system, the name Joni was subsequently retired, from the list of names for the region by the World Meteorological Organization. This would normally mean that the name would not be used again in the region, however, the name remained on the list and was used during the 2008–09 season.|$|E
5|$|Tuvalu {{participated in}} three Summer Olympics between {{its debut in}} the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This was {{the least amount of}} {{competitors}} Tuvalu has ever sent, and the only delegate to send one competitor in these Olympics. Tuvalu has sent 3 competitors in their other two appearances. No <b>Tuvaluan</b> has ever won a medal at the Olympics. As he was the only competitor, Etimoni was the one to bear the flag. He qualified via a universality slot from the International Association of Athletics Federations.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Tuvaluans</b> {{benefited from}} the canned food {{supplied}} by the American forces, although the change in diet continued after the war, which resulted in long term impacts on health. <b>Tuvaluans</b> adopted a diet that includes high levels of corned beef, rice and sugar. This food is consumed even when fish and traditional vegetables are available. This diet is believed to contribute to increasing levels of diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases among Tualuans.|$|R
25|$|New Zealand has {{an annual}} quota of 75 <b>Tuvaluans</b> granted work permits under the Pacific Access Category, as {{announced}} in 2001. The applicants register for the Pacific Access Category (PAC) ballots; the primary criteria {{is that the}} principal applicant must have a job offer from a New Zealand employer. <b>Tuvaluans</b> also have access to seasonal employment in the horticulture and viticulture industries in New Zealand under the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) Work Policy introduced in 2007 allowing for employment of up to 5,000 workers from Tuvalu and other Pacific islands. <b>Tuvaluans</b> can participate in the Australian Pacific Seasonal Worker Program, which allows Pacific Islanders to obtain seasonal employment in the Australian agriculture industry, in particular cotton and cane operations; fishing industry, in particular aquaculture; and with accommodation providers in the tourism industry.|$|R
5|$|With {{effect from}} June 12, {{a state of}} public {{emergency}} was declared {{for the whole of}} Tuvalu, by the then Governor-General of Tuvalu, Sir Tulaga Manuella. This was because there was only a limited amount of food available on Funafuti to cater for the whole of the island nation, while providing Niulakita with immediate relief supplies. This enabled the <b>Tuvaluan</b> embassy in Suva, Fiji to appeal to various overseas countries and organisations including Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United Nations Development Programme to provide aid and assistance to the island nation. During June 14, the Royal New Zealand Air Force deployed a transport plane carrying some relief materials including tarpaulins and water from New Zealand. The plane subsequently stopped in Noumea, New Caledonia and Nadi, Fiji to pick up further relief supplies that had been donated by Australia, Fiji and France. The crew of the plane subsequently conducted an aerial assessment of the damage on Niulakita, and reported seeing widespread damage, before they arrived at Funafuti Airport during June 15.|$|E

25|$|Apisai Ielemia became prime {{minister}} following the <b>Tuvaluan</b> general election, 2006 {{that was held}} on 3 August 2006.

25|$|<b>Tuvaluan</b> {{seafarers}} {{compete with}} seafarers from Kiribati and South and Southeast Asian countries. There are higher transport costs for <b>Tuvaluan</b> and I-Kiribati seafarers {{to travel to}} take up positions of ships put them as a disadvantage as compared to other seafarers. Structural changes to merchant shipping industry have occurred following the GFC with the industry suffering low profitability and overcapacity. The increasing automation of ship operations has also reduced the demand for <b>Tuvaluan</b> seafarers. The training provided by the TMTI is generally for traditional merchant vessels so that <b>Tuvaluan</b> seafarers need to acquire the experience in technologies used on modern container ships while working on these ships.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Tuvaluan</b> {{language}} and English are the national languages of Tuvalu. <b>Tuvaluan</b> {{is of the}} Ellicean group of Polynesian languages, distantly related to all other Polynesian languages such as Hawaiian, Māori, Tahitian, Rapa Nui, Samoan and Tongan. It is most {{closely related to the}} languages spoken on the Polynesian outliers in Micronesia and northern and central Melanesia. The <b>Tuvaluan</b> language has borrowed from the Samoan language, as a consequence of Christian missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries being predominantly Samoan.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} Tuvaluans are {{employed}} as merchant seamen on cargo ships on contracts {{of up to}} 12 months. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that, as of 2011, there were 800 <b>Tuvaluan</b> men trained, certified and active as seafarers. The ADB estimates that, at any one time, about 15 percent of the adult male population works abroad as seafarers.

Tuvaluan-British tensions date back to the colonial era when Tuvalu was part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony. The Gilbertese were Micronesian and are in Kiribati, while the <b>Tuvaluans</b> were largely Polynesian. In 1975, the <b>Tuvaluans</b> demanded separation from Gilbert Islands and also sought independence from the Britain.|$|R
