5|$|McAleer's rift with Johnson, {{along with}} his sudden retirement, damaged his {{professional}} reputation, and he received little recognition for his contributions to baseball. Today, he is most often remembered for initiating the customary request that the President of the United States <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> the first ball of the season.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{selected}} by the Detroit Lions {{in the first round}} as the second pick overall in the 2007 NFL Draft. This is the highest a Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket has ever been drafted. The Lions were expected to trade Johnson, most likely to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but the team announced that they were keeping him. The next day, the Detroit Tigers invited him to <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> the ceremonial first pitch.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund {{took the}} {{customary}} oath of the Transylvanian monarchs on 23December 1588. Pope Sixtus V excommunicated {{him for the}} expulsion of the Jesuits. Sigismund's cousin, Cardinal Andrew Báthory, urged the pope to lift the ban, saying that the prince's Protestant advisors had forced him to <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> the friars. The pope authorized Sigismund to employ a confessor in May 1589, and the excommunication was revoked on Easter 1590.|$|E
50|$|Karkovice {{was one of}} {{the best}} fielding {{catchers}} in the Major Leagues during his time with the White Sox. For his career, he <b>threw</b> <b>out</b> 41% of base stealers. In 1993, he <b>threw</b> <b>out</b> 54% of them.|$|R
50|$|During {{his time}} as third base coach, Thomson was {{regularly}} criticized for sending runners home who routinely were <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> at home plate. In 2014, the Yankees were tied with the Angels for the AL lead with 21 players <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> at home.|$|R

5|$|At first, the dissenting deputies {{were often}} {{convinced}} or cowed back to withdraw their objections. Also, at first, the rule {{was used to}} strike down only individual laws, not to dissolve the chamber and <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> all measures passed. For example, as historian Władysław Czapliński describes in the Sejm of 1611 context, some resolutions were struck down, but others passed. From the mid-17th century onward, however, an objection to any item of Sejm legislation from a deputy or senator automatically caused other, earlier adopted legislation to be rejected. That was because all legislation that was adopted by a given Sejm formed a whole.|$|E
5|$|Four of the This Year in Baseball Awards {{also went}} to the Phillies. Lidge was {{recognized}} as the Closer of the Year, while Utley won the Postseason Moment of the Year award for his fake throw to first base which allowed him to <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> Rays' shortstop Jason Bartlett at home plate during the World Series. Manager Charlie Manuel and general manager Pat Gillick were also named Manager of the Year (distinct from Major League Baseball's Manager of the Year award) and Executive of the Year, respectively, for their leadership of the 2008 team and for winning the World Series.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{gameplay}} issues when the player takes {{their turn to}} bat. The AI is not developed and, when the player hits a pitch, it nearly always takes the longest possible route to the ball, making runs easier to score. It also lacks the capability to <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> a runner who is returning to a base (instead of advancing) or perform a double play after catching a fly ball. Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, Schneider was {{the first}} player to play catcher in Washington Nationals history. That same year, Schneider <b>threw</b> <b>out</b> a majors-leading 38 percent of would-be base stealers. Between 2003 and 2005, he <b>threw</b> <b>out</b> 43.5 percent of base-stealers, the best ratio in {{baseball}} over that period.|$|R
60|$|The Indian {{was digging}} {{in the sand and}} dust under the {{shelving}} wall. He <b>threw</b> <b>out</b> an object that rang against the stone. It was a belt buckle. He <b>threw</b> <b>out</b> old shrunken, withered boots. He came upon other things, and then he ceased to dig.|$|R

5|$|On 4 November 2010, Stabæk Holding {{stated that}} they were near a bankruptcy, and that they {{intended}} to <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> Stabæk as a tenant, remove the turf and instead use the venue exclusively for events. Chair Diderik Schnitler in Stabæk Holding stated that the business model was not sustainable. The football schedule was not made until early in the year, while in the event business, bookings were common {{one to two years}} in advance. It was therefore difficult to secure lucrative events, as large parts of the year had to be held in reserve in case the venue was needed for yet-to-be scheduled matches. The holding company {{stated that they}} might have to file for bankruptcy. Stabæk Fotball stated that they had a 40-year contract to use the venue.|$|E
5|$|The katipo has {{medically}} significant venom in humans, although bites are rare. The {{incidence of}} bites is low {{as it is}} a shy, non-aggressive spider. Their narrow range, diminishing population, and human awareness of where they live means interaction between humans and the spider is minimal. The katipo will only bite as a last resort; if molested, the spider will usually fold up into a ball and drop to the ground or retreat to the nearest cover. If the threat continues, the spider may <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> silk against the interference. When restrained in any way or held against skin, such as if tangled up in clothing, the spider will then bite defensively. However, if the female is with an egg sac it will remain close by it and sometimes move offensively to bite any threat.|$|E
5|$|On April 1, {{the defense}} {{asked for the}} new trial to be moved outside Brownsville, {{claiming}} their client had received unfair treatment {{in the media and}} there was no chance for her to have a fair trial and an unbiased jury. The request included large numbers of magazines and newspaper articles published since 1993. It did not cite any specific passages where the alleged media bias was demonstrated. The defense also filed a motion to <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> the new indictment {{on the grounds that it}} was double jeopardy. On April 27, the judge decided to postpone his decision about where to hold the trial. He also rejected the defense motion stating that the new indictment was a case of double jeopardy. The defense argued that the prosecution had illegally used Brownsville and Houston grand juries to work on the case, but the judge countered that claim saying only the Houston grand jury had handled the case. On May 4, the trial was moved from Brownsville to Houston, Texas, because of the earlier extensive media coverage.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} pitch thrown by Harvey, Alcides Escobar hit an inside-the-park home run, {{the first in a}} World Series game since Mule Haas in the 1929 World Series, and the first hit by a leadoff batter since Patsy Dougherty did it for the Boston Americans in the 1903 World Series. In the fourth inning, Murphy {{recorded}} the Mets' first hit, and later scored their first run on a hit by Travis d'Arnaud. Curtis Granderson hit a home run in the fifth inning to give the Mets a 2–1 lead. The Mets took a 3–1 lead {{in the top of the}} sixth when Michael Conforto drove in Yoenis Céspedes with a sacrifice fly. Mike Moustakas then saved a run with a diving stop and <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> to first to end the top of the sixth. Eric Hosmer reduced the lead to 3–2 with a sacrifice fly, and set a new Royals' postseason run batted in (RBI) record in the process. A single by Moustakas tied the game at three, but in the top of the eighth, Wilmer Flores reached on an fielding error by Hosmer, allowing Juan Lagares to score the go-ahead run and give the Mets a 4–3 lead. In the bottom of the ninth with the Mets 2 outs away from taking Game 1, Alex Gordon tied the game for the Royals with a home run to deep center field, as Jeurys Familia blew his first save in six postseason opportunities and his first since July 30. With the home run, Gordon became the first player since Scott Brosius in the 2001 World Series, and just the fifth player in history, to tie a World Series game on a home run in the ninth inning.|$|E

25|$|Garratts {{enjoy an}} {{advantage}} over the Mallet system, because of the geometry of the design. When swinging around curves the boiler and cab unit move inward like a bowstring in the bow of a curve and this reduces the centrifugal force that would overturn a normal locomotive and which in turn permits faster running. The Mallet's forward articulated unit tends to <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> as the loco rounds curves. While most Garratts were designed for freight or mixed traffic, there were several passenger Garratt classes. A Garratt holds the world speed record for an articulated locomotive.|$|E
