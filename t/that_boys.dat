5|$|Besides {{population}} statistics, Villani {{also offered}} statistics on education. He wrote <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> and girls {{learning to read}} numbered 8,000 to 10,000 each year. There were 1,000 to 1,200 children learning to use the abacus and algorism for mathematics. In the four large, prestigious schools of Florence, there were always 550 to 600 students in attendance to learn proper grammar and scholastic logic.|$|E

5|$|Janet Burnett Grossman {{writes that}} girls {{appear to be}} commemorated about as {{frequently}} as boys on surviving Attic gravestones, although previous scholars suggested <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> were commemorated up to twice as often. If they survived, Athenian children were named in a ceremony (the dekate) ten days after birth. Other Athenian ceremonies celebrating childbirth (at five, seven, and forty days after birth) were also observed. Later rites of passage were apparently more common and elaborate for boys than for girls.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to England, Baden-Powell noticed <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> showed {{considerable}} interest in Aids to Scouting, which was unexpectedly used by teachers and youth organizations as their first Scouting handbook. He was urged to rewrite this book for boys, especially during an inspection of the Boys' Brigade, a large youth movement drilled with military precision. Baden-Powell thought {{this would not be}} attractive and suggested that the Boys' Brigade could grow much larger were Scouting to be used. He studied other schemes, parts of which he used for Scouting.|$|E
5|$|Sigeberht {{secured the}} future of the Church in East Anglia when he {{established}} a school in his kingdom so <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> could be taught reading and writing in Latin, on the model that he had witnessed in Gaul. Felix assisted him by obtaining teachers of the kind who taught in Kent. According to the Life of Gregory the Great, Paulinus of York, who from 633 to 644 was the Bishop of Rochester in northern Kent, had been connected with Rædwald's court during the exile of Edwin.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{tuition at}} the school was free, funded by various endowments and rents {{obtained}} from lands the most significant arising from the Abolition of the Chantries Acts, and the re-appropriation of funds to the school. In 1944 under the Education Act education remained free, however the common entrance exam at eleven was introduced and the school became a selective grammar school. School fees were introduced in 1977 when the school withdrew from the maintained system and became independent. For the year 2013/2014 they are £14,670 (approximately €17,900 or US$24,500 as of March 2014) per year excluding lunches. All those wishing to be admitted now take the schools own internal 11+ entrance examination which tests English, mathematics and verbal reasoning and attend an interview with two members of staff. If a place is awarded, entry can de deferred for two years so <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> who are at prep school may enter at thirteen. Those entering at thirteen must take the 13+ Common Entrance or the scholarship examination to confirm their place.|$|E

5|$|Khitan {{marriage}} practices {{differed from}} those of the Han Chinese in several ways. Men from the elite classes tended to marry women from the generation their senior. While this did not necessarily mean {{that there would be a}} large gap in ages between husband and wife, it was often the case. Among the ruling Yelü clan, the average age <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> married was sixteen, while the average age that girls married was between sixteen and twenty-two. Although rare, ages as young as twelve were recorded, for both boys and girls. A special variety of polygamy known as sororate, in which a man would marry two or more women who were sisters, was practiced among the Liao elite. Polygamy was not restricted only to sororate, with some men having three or more wives, only some of whom were sisters. Sororate continued throughout the length of the Liao dynasty, despite laws banning the practice. Over the course of the dynasty, the Liao elite moved away from polygamy and towards the Han Chinese system of having one wife and one or more concubines. This was done largely to smooth over the process of inheritance.|$|E

25|$|When {{comparing}} the sexual self-concepts of adolescent girls and boys, researchers found <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> experienced lower sexual self-esteem and higher sexual anxiety. The boys stated {{they were less}} able to refuse or resist sex at a greater rate than the girls reported having difficulty with this. The authors state {{that this may be}} because society places so much emphasis on teaching girls how to be resistant towards sex, <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> don’t learn these skills and are less able to use them when they want to say no to sex. They also explain how society’s stereotype <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> are always ready to desire sex and be aroused may contribute to the fact that many boys may not feel comfortable resisting sex, because it is something society tells them they should want. Because society expects adolescent boys to be assertive, dominant and in control, they are limited in how they feel it is appropriate to act within a romantic relationship. Many boys feel lower self-esteem when they can’t attain these hyper-masculine ideals that society says they should. Additionally, there is not much guidance on how boys should act within relationships and many boys {{do not know how to}} retain their masculinity while being authentic and reciprocating affection in their relationships. This difficult dilemma is called the double-edged sword of masculinity by some researchers.|$|E

25|$|Bedouin girls face {{additional}} {{obstacles to}} their education. Among {{the biggest problems}} {{is the nature of}} the schools. Most Bedouin schools are co-ed, meaning <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> and girls study together. For many families (especially the more traditional ones), this is unacceptable, particularly because of the presence of boys from other tribes. The drop out rate for Bedouin girls is much higher than that of Bedouin boys (85% vs. 71%, respectively). The fact <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> and girls study together is arguably a driving force behind this incredibly high rate. A study conducted by Abu-Rabia-Queder found that the most important factor in whether girls remained in schools was the decision of her father. In other words, if the girl’s father did not agree with her education, there was little chance of her remaining in school. Generally, men who were themselves educated and/or employed were much more likely to support their daughters' educations. However, of the fathers surveyed by the study, none approved of coeducation. Those who disapproved most strongly were more likely to pull their daughters out of school, even if they recognized the benefits education could bring for their daughters.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of {{testicular}} cancer occurring in undescended testes is seminoma. It is usually treatable if caught early, so urologists often recommend <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> who had orchiopexy as infants be taught testicular self-examination, to recognize testicular masses and seek early medical care for them. Cancer developing in an intra-abdominal testis would be unlikely to be recognized before considerable growth and spread, and {{one of the advantages of}} orchiopexy is that a mass developing in a scrotal testis is far easier to recognize than an intra-abdominal mass.|$|E
