He put Foveaux's name forward to succeed Collins as Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania {{because he could}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> one more fitting, and considered {{that he could not}} have acted otherwise with regard to Bligh. However, when Foveaux returned to England in 1810 he was court-martialled for assenting to Bligh being deposed and imprisoned; Macquarie's recommendation was ignored. Foveaux was taken back into active service in 1811 and promoted lieutenant-colonel of the Greek Light Infantry; he pursued an uneventful military career after that, rising to the rank of lieutenant-general.|$|E
25|$|A {{retreating}} Siraj-ud-Daulah met the British at Plassey. He {{had to make}} camp 27 {{miles away}} from Murshidabad. On 23 June 1757 Siraj-ud-Daulah called on Mir Jafar because he was saddened by the sudden fall of Mir Mardan who was a very dear companion of Siraj in battles. The Nawab asked for help from Mir Jafar. Mir Jafar advised Siraj to retreat for that day. The Nawab made the blunder in giving the order to stop the fight. Following his command, the soldiers of the Nawab were returning to their camps. At that time, Robert Clive attacked the soldiers with his army. At such a sudden attack, the army of Siraj became indisciplined and could <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> way to fight. So all fled away in such a situation. Betrayed by a conspiracy plotted by Jagat Seth, Mir Jafar, Krishna Chandra, Omichund etc., he lost the battle and had to escape. He went first to Murshidabad and then to Patna by boat, but was eventually arrested by Mir Jafar's soldiers.|$|E

In 2015, the film was selected by the United States Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". Darabont responded: [...] "I can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> greater honor than for The Shawshank Redemption to be considered part of our country's cinematic legacy."

[...] The episode was written to create closure to Doggett's story.

Creamer recorded that [...] "Babe Ruth transcended sport and moved far beyond the artificial limits of baselines and outfield fences and sports pages". Wagenheim stated, [...] "He appealed to a deeply rooted American yearning for the definitive climax: clean, quick, unarguable." [...] According to Glenn Stout, [...] "Ruth's home runs were exalted, uplifting experience that meant more to fans than any runs they were responsible for. A Babe Ruth home run was an event unto itself, one that meant anything was possible." ...|$|E

500|$|Off the field, Granderson {{has served}} as an {{ambassador}} for Major League Baseball International. He has traveled to England, Italy, the Netherlands, France, South Africa, China, New Zealand, South Korea and Japan to promote baseball. In appreciation for his efforts, Commissioner Bud Selig penned a thank-you letter to Granderson which read in part, [...] "There are so many fine young men playing Major League baseball today, but I can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> one who is better suited to represent our national pastime than you." [...] He has also served as something of an unofficial baseball ambassador to the African-American community, often participating in and initiating dialogue {{about the lack of}} black players {{at all levels of the}} sport. When he endorsed Nike, Inc., Louisville Slugger and Rawlings, he asked them to donate money to his foundation or equipment to inner-city baseball programs rather than pay him.|$|E
500|$|By 1868, Creangă's rebellious stance was irritating his {{hierarchical}} superiors, and, {{according to}} Călinescu, his consecutive actions {{show that he}} was [...] "going out of his way for scandal". He was initially punished for attending a Iași Theater performance, as well as for defiantly claiming that there was [...] "nothing scandalous or demoralizing" [...] in what he had seen, and reportedly further antagonized the monks by firing a gun to scare off the rooks nesting on his church. The latter incident, which some commentators believe fabricated by Creangă's detractors, was judged absurd by the ecclesiastical authorities, who had been further alarmed by negative reporting in the press. When told that no clergyman other than him had been seen using a gun, Creangă issued a reply deemed [...] "Nasreddinesque" [...] by George Călinescu, maintaining that, unlike others, he was not afraid of doing so. Confronted by Metropolitan Calinic himself, Creangă allegedly argued that he could <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> other way to eliminate rooks, being eventually pardoned by the prelate when it was ruled that he had not infringed on canon law.|$|E

After the news of his death, leading figures from the world of {{football}} and politics paid tribute to him. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called him a [...] "great friend, a wonderful individual and tremendous football man". UEFA president Michel Platini said, [...] "He will be remembered not only for his playing career and his outstanding managerial career at both club and international level, but also because he was a truly warm and passionate human being." [...] Gary Lineker said, [...] "It is a sad day and a great loss. He was a wonderful man and will be deeply missed by everybody in the country. I never played for a more enthusiastic man. He gave so much to the game." [...] Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair described Robson as a [...] "real Geordie gentleman". According to the then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Robson [...] "epitomised everything that is great about football in this country". His friend, the broadcaster Michael Parkinson, said, [...] "Robson will be remembered long after the present lot are old bones. By his decency, his humour, his love of the game's traditions and origins and confusion at what it had become, he made present day football look what it is – shabby by comparison.

500|$|Many {{contemporary}} {{film critics}} have written favorably about the film. It has been {{hailed as a}} masterpiece by Kent Jones, Adolf Heinzlmeier, Berndt Schulz and Penelope Gilliatt, who said it was [...] "not only a masterpiece of filmmaking, not only a great work of humanism in a perfect rococo frame, but also an act of historical testimony." [...] Its themes have been analyzed by film scholar and Renoir's biographer Leo Braudy, who observed that the film [...] "embodies a social world {{in which there are}} rules but no values. If you don't know the rules, you are crushed; but if you do know the rules you are cut off from your own nature." [...] Dudley Andrew described the film's [...] "complex social criticism" [...] while Kenneth Browser and Peter Cowie wrote about its sense of humanity. Other critics have written about the film's darker themes; Andrew Sarris praised its depiction of class differences. The complexity of Renoir's storytelling techniques have been examined by Roger Ebert, who called it [...] "so simple and so labyrinthine, so guileless and so angry, so innocent and so dangerous, that you can't simply watch it, you have to absorb it", Luc Sante, who called it [...] "a dense clockwork mechanism" [...] and Robin Wood, who said the film [...] "operates on all levels." [...] Critics have praised its farcical elements: Pauline Kael called it [...] "a great satirical comedy, a dance of death" [...] and Gerald Mast wrote [...] " [...] depicts the failure of love, the failure of society, and the failure of men to rise above the ridiculous. Their only success is that they try and they care." [...] David Thomson praised Renoir's performance and remarked on [...] "Renoir's admission that the director, supposedly the authoritative and manipulating figure, is as much victim as originator of circumstances." [...] Amy Taubin said [...] "I can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> other film that is as unfailingly generousto its audience, its characters, its actors, the milieu and the medium." [...] J. Hoberman wrote about its influence on Woody Allen, Robert Altman and Mike Leigh.|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1891, Chicago businesswoman Bertha Palmer {{approached}} Cassatt {{to paint}} a 12' × 58' mural about [...] "Modern Woman" [...] for the Women's Building for the World's Columbian Exposition {{to be held in}} 1893. Cassatt completed the project {{over the next two years}} while living in France with her mother. The mural was designed as a triptych. The central theme was titled Young Women Plucking the Fruits of Knowledge or Science. The left panel was Young Girls Pursuing Fame and the right panel Arts, Music, Dancing. The mural displays a community of women apart from their relation to men, as accomplished persons in their own right. Palmer considered Cassatt to be an American treasure and could <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> one better {{to paint a}} mural at an exposition that was to do so much to focus the world's attention on the status of women. Unfortunately the mural did not survive following the run of the exhibition when the building was torn down. Cassatt made several studies and paintings on themes similar to those in the mural, so it is possible to see her development of those ideas and images. Cassatt also exhibited other paintings in the Exposition.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} features {{that appeared to be}} absent from the release version of No Man's Sky was its multiplayer capabilities.

Because {{of the size of the}} game's universe, Hello Games estimated that more than 99.9% of the planets would never be explored by players, and that the likelihood of meeting another player through chance encounters is nearly zero. Murray had stated in a 2014 interview that No Man's Sky would include a matchmaking system that is similar to that used for Journey when such encounters do occur; each online player would have an [...] "open lobby" [...] that any players in their in-universe proximity would enter and leave. This approach was envisioned to provide [...] "cool moments" [...] for players as they encounter each other, but not meant to support gameplay like player versus environment or fully cooperative modes.|$|E
