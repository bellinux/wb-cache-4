5|$|The Brick Lane {{screening}} – on 8 December 1995 – {{had been}} previewed in NME, and was chaotically busy. It was originally planned {{for a car}} park, but freezing conditions and snow forced a rethink and <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> was moved indoors, to {{the basement of the}} nearby Seven Stars pub. Hundreds of people crammed in to watch <b>the</b> <b>screening,</b> which was eventually abandoned partway through due to the cramped conditions. The NME preview had claimed that after <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> the film would be cut up and individual frames sold off to the public. Gimpo, the owner of the film, had no intention of doing so, but after <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> was nearly overwhelmed by a mob of people wanting to take home a piece of the film.|$|E

5|$|After rehearsing in the Marshalls for the {{invasion}} of the Marianas, New Jersey put to sea 6 June in <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> and bombardment group of Admiral Mitscher's Task Force. On the second day of preinvasion air strikes, 12 June, New Jersey shot down an enemy torpedo bomber, and during the next two days her heavy guns battered Saipan and Tinian, in advance of the marine landings on 15 June.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>screener</b> {{positions}} {{himself with}} his back to the basket on the same side of the court as the cutter. The cutter positions himself outside of and above <b>the</b> <b>screener.</b> [...] "Outside" [...] implies that the cutter is closer to the sideline than <b>the</b> <b>screener.</b> [...] "Above" [...] implies that the cutter is closer to the midcourt line than <b>the</b> <b>screener.</b> Neither player has the ball. With <b>the</b> <b>screener</b> completely stationary, <b>the</b> cutter moves toward the basket and passes close enough to <b>the</b> <b>screener</b> that they almost touch shoulders. If the cut is properly made, the player defending the cutter will be disrupted by <b>the</b> <b>screener</b> (who has not moved while setting <b>the</b> <b>screen)</b> and <b>the</b> cutter will have an opportunity to receive a pass very near the basket.|$|R
50|$|It {{differs from}} <b>the</b> Second <b>screen</b> configuration. <b>The</b> latter {{typically}} has <b>the</b> first <b>screen</b> {{being a big}} <b>screen</b> and <b>the</b> second <b>screen</b> being <b>the</b> smaller <b>screen</b> of a cellphone. Where <b>the</b> small <b>screen</b> cannot affect or control <b>the</b> big <b>screen.</b> <b>The</b> small <b>screen</b> {{is often used to}} provide supplementary data on the content of <b>the</b> big <b>screen.</b> In contrast, SSI is distinguished by <b>the</b> small <b>screen</b> being able to change the flow of information or content on <b>the</b> big <b>screen.</b>|$|R
5|$|Among the {{highlights}} of the 2010 calendar is <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> of the BBC's nature documentary Planet Earth Live on July 21, with live Grant Park Symphony Orchestra accompaniment featuring the score by five-time Academy Award-nominated composer George Fenton, who serves as conductor.|$|E
5|$|Between April 2008 and the film's {{commercial}} {{release in}} August 2008, the film had over 250 promotional screenings. On August 3, 2008, Stiller, Downey, and Black visited Camp Pendleton, a U.S. Marine Corps base in California, {{to present a}} screening to over a thousand military members and their families. <b>The</b> <b>screening</b> was {{on behalf of the}} United Service Organizations and included the actors heading to <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> by helicopter and Humvees. On August 8, 2008, a special 30-minute fictional E! True Hollywood Story aired about the making of Tropic Thunder. In video games, a themed scavenger hunt was incorporated into , and Stiller allowed his likeness {{to be used in the}} online Facebook application game based on the film.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin and {{daunorubicin}} together can {{be thought}} of as prototype compounds for the anthracyclines. Subsequent research has led to many other anthracycline antibiotics, or analogs, and there are now over 2,000 known analogs of doxorubicin. By 1991, 553 of them had been evaluated in <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> program at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). In 2016 GPX-150 was granted orphan drug designation by US FDA.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>screen</b> turns itself {{off when}} a person is on a call. This is to prevent <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> {{accepting}} unwanted inputs from the user's face when they are making a call, but it also requires the user to turn <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> back on if they want to use <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> Removing <b>the</b> stylus when in a phone call both turns on <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> and starts up the notes application (if so selected as an option by the user).|$|R
50|$|One {{to three}} pigeons, trained by operant {{conditioning}} {{to recognize the}} target, were stationed {{in front of the}} screen; when they saw the target, they would peck at <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> with their beaks. As long as the target remained in the center of <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> would not move, but if the bomb began to go off track, the image would move towards the edge of <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> <b>The</b> pigeons would follow the image, pecking at it, which would move <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> on its pivots.|$|R

5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> of {{the short}} for MGM executives, opinion was divided on whether Garland or Durbin should be retained. Finally, Louis B. Mayer, upon his return from a European trip, decreed that both girls should be kept. However, Durbin's {{contract}} option had expired by then. She was signed by Universal Studios, where her first picture, Three Smart Girls, was so successful that it saved Universal from bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|Impressionist Francine Lewis {{performed}} {{an impression of}} Dot Cotton in the seventh series of Britain's Got Talent. During 2003, a promotional advertisement for the BBC featuring a character, Fizz, from the children's television programme The Tweenies pulling off a mask and morphing into Dot received complaints. Parents complained that their children were having nightmares and the BBC subsequently moved back <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> times.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, a cinema {{owner in}} Brighton persuaded Hendry to lend him the films, {{so as to}} screen the episodes for profit while the Panopticon VI {{convention}} was being held in the town. Saied Marham, an associate of Hendry's, visited Panopticon to generate interest in the showing, only to be dismissed as a hoaxster, and <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> did not go ahead.|$|E

5000|$|Each level (called [...] "Sector" [...] in the game) {{consists}} of only <b>the</b> visible <b>screen.</b> <b>The</b> {{top and bottom}} of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> are connected, as are the left and right side of <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> meaning if anything leaves <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> it will appear again on the opposite side. (A Sector {{can be thought of as}} the surface of a torus laid out flat.) ...|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it has a}} {{downside}} of possible blockage to <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> due to <b>the</b> feed slurry containing small crystals besides large and normal solids crystals. Consequently, this causes <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to become less permeable so the liquids flow over <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> rather than passing through <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> mesh. This problem, however, can be overcome by reducing the flow rate of feed.|$|R
5|$|In 2010, Cinema Retro {{magazine}} {{hosted a}} screening of the film at Ettington Park. Richard Johnson was a special guest at the event and participated in a Q prior to <b>the</b> <b>screening.</b> Johnson {{said that he had}} never actually stepped foot in the hall during filming, and that this was the first occasion he had actually been inside the premises. The movie was mentioned in Dan Simmons' 2002 novel A Winter Haunting.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, {{a case of}} {{copyright}} infringement was filed on the film's producer and director that prompted a court to stall <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> of the film.

5|$|In {{the general}} population, {{screening}} of large groups is not currently considered effective, although newer techniques, and <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> of tightly targeted groups, are being evaluated. Nevertheless, regular screening with endoscopic ultrasound and MRI/CT imaging {{is recommended for}} those at high risk from inherited genetics.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{suppressor}} grid voltage and not <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> grid voltage controls <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> current, if <b>the</b> suppressor and <b>screen</b> grid are coupled {{together with a}} capacitor (C2) {{so there is a}} constant potential difference between them, increasing <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> grid voltage will increase the suppressor voltage, resulting in a decrease in screen current. This means <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> grid has negative differential resistance with respect to the cathode, and can be used to create oscillations.|$|R
50|$|Winlogon {{monitors}} {{keyboard and}} mouse activity {{to determine when}} to activate <b>screen</b> savers. After <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> saver is activated, Winlogon continues to monitor keyboard and mouse activity to determine when to terminate <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> saver. If <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> saver is marked as secure, Winlogon treats the workstation as locked. When there is mouse or keyboard activity, Winlogon invokes the WlxDisplayLockedNotice function of the GINA and locked workstation behavior resumes. If <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> saver is not secure, any keyboard or mouse activity terminates <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> saver without notification to the GINA.|$|R

2500|$|The {{center of}} <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> shows a {{vertical}} scrolling road with two lanes; the areas {{either side of}} the road are used for scores and instructions. The player's car is driving up the road and every few seconds a donkey will appear at random {{on one side of the}} road at the top of <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> As <b>the</b> donkey moves down <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>the</b> player can press the space bar to switch between lanes to avoid the donkey. If the car hits the donkey, both car and donkey explode, and parts of the graphics are scattered to the four corners of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to <b>the</b> sound of a short monophonic tune played through the PC speaker, with the word [...] "BOOM!"

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>screen</b> {{is placed}} atop a substrate. Ink {{is placed on}} top of <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> and a floodbar is used to push the ink through {{the holes in the}} mesh. The {{operator}} begins with the fill bar at the rear of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> and behind a reservoir of ink. The operator lifts <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to prevent contact with the substrate and then using a slight amount of downward force pulls the fill bar to the front of <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> This effectively fills the mesh openings with ink and moves the ink reservoir to the front of <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> <b>The</b> operator then uses a squeegee (rubber blade) to move the mesh down to the substrate and pushes the squeegee to the rear of <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> <b>The</b> ink that is in the mesh opening is pumped or squeezed by capillary action to the substrate in a controlled and prescribed amount, i.e. the wet ink deposit is proportional to the thickness of the mesh and or stencil. As the squeegee moves toward the rear of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>the</b> tension of the mesh pulls the mesh up away from the substrate (called snap-off) leaving the ink upon the substrate surface.|$|R
40|$|Background  The {{introduction}} of patient screens for outpatient procedures {{is becoming increasingly}} common. To date, {{the impact on the}} patient of viewing <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> remains unknown. Objectives  To explore how viewing <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> during a hysteroscopy procedure affects the patient’s experience. Setting  The outpatient clinics at the Royal Surrey Hospital in Guildford and the Royal Infirmary in Bradford. Design  A randomised control trial. Sample  Women undergoing a hysteroscopy procedure were randomly allocated to see <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> (n = 81) or not to see <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> (n = 76). Methods  A quantitative study with measures taken before and after the intervention. Main outcome measures  Pain perception, mood, illness cognitions, communication. Results  Seeing <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> or not had no impact on several measures of pain perception, mood, illness cognitions or communication. However, women who did not see <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> were more optimistic about the effectiveness of their treatment and felt that the health professional was more receptive to them during the consultation compared with those who saw <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> After controlling for the use of a local anaesthetic, those who did not see <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> also reported a greater decrease in anxiety after the procedure. However, those who saw <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> described pain more positively (i. e. in terms of comfort, reassurance or encouragement) compared with those who did not see <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> Conclusion  Viewing <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> does not benefit the patient and may interfere with the patient–physician interaction...|$|R
