5|$|Local {{symptoms}} include immediate and intense pain, followed {{after a few}} minutes (but perhaps by as much as 30 minutes) by swelling and a tingling sensation. Blisters containing blood are not common. The pain may spread within a few hours, along with tenderness and inflammation. Reddish lymphangitic lines and bruising may appear, and the whole limb can become swollen and bruised within 24 hours. Swelling may also spread <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk,</b> and with children, throughout the entire body. Necrosis and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.|$|E
5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in late evening or {{the early hours of}} the morning. The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} from LEMS typically {{involves the}} muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk).</b> In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).|$|E

50|$|Rhacophorus georgii live in lowland forests, below 800 m asl. These frogs attach foamy egg masses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> of trees, 1-3 cm above water-filled tree cavities; each female {{can carry}} 29-108 eggs. Upon hatching, tadpoles fall to these water-filled cavities.|$|R
25|$|Symptoms include severe headache, a {{sustained}} high fever, cough, rash, severe muscle pain, chills, falling blood pressure, stupor, sensitivity to light, delirium and death. A rash begins {{on the chest}} about {{five days after the}} fever appears, and spreads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> and extremities. A symptom common to all forms of typhus is a fever which may reach 39°C (102°F).|$|E
25|$|Seeds are cached {{on and off}} of the ground, {{depending}} on the season. Seeds are cached {{on the ground in}} areas with sparse vegetation and exposed, well-drained soils. Seeds are buried in the litter of dead needles and twigs, and between organic material and mineral soil. Seeds are cached close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of trees, most often on the south side where snow melts most quickly. Ground-caching stops when snow covers the ground.|$|E
25|$|Leaves grow {{directly}} from the trunk, and typically fall when older, leaving a crown of leaves at the top. The leaves grow in a rosette form, with new foliage emerging from the top and center of the crown. The trunk may be buried, so the leaves appear to be emerging from the ground, so the plant {{appears to be a}} basal rosette. The leaves are generally large in proportion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> size, and sometimes even larger than the trunk.|$|E

25|$|Rubella has {{symptoms}} {{that are similar}} to those of flu. However, the primary symptom of rubella virus infection is the appearance of a rash (exanthem) on the face which spreads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> and limbs and usually fades after three days (that is why it is often referred to as three-day measles). The facial rash usually clears as it spreads to other parts of the body. Other symptoms include low grade fever, swollen glands (sub-occipital and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy), joint pains, headache, and conjunctivitis.|$|E
25|$|Carginan's {{tendency}} to produce short shoots with clusters that grow closely <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of the vine {{means that it}} is difficult variety to harvest mechanically. However, the economy of scale for blending varieties or grapes destined for lower priced box and jug wines often do not work well with the expense and labor cost of hand-harvesting. Among the viticultural hazards that Carignan is susceptible to include powdery mildew and infestation of the vine from grape worms and the European Grapevine Moth. The vine has some slight resistance to the fungal disease of botrytis bunch rot, downy mildew, and phomopsis.|$|E
25|$|There {{is great}} support behind {{the idea of}} the {{thalamus}} affecting mitempfindung. Because of the arrangement of sensory regions in the thalamus, there may be a spread of excitation in this brain region. Studies have shown that the thalamic region dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> is found between the regions supporting sensation from the arms and legs. This supports the finding that trigger zones in the chest area lead to referred sensation in the legs. And since the thalamic region for the face lies in a separate area called the arcuate nucleus, this explains why the face remains unaffected by referred itch.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the national highways, the government has embarked on an expansive reconstruction of spur secondary routes, which connect smaller towns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> routes. In {{the last few years}} the government constructed a 106-kilometer toll road that connects Santo Domingo with the country's northeastern peninsula. Travelers may now arrive in the Samaná Peninsula in less than two hours. Other additions are the reconstruction of the DR-28 (Jarabacoa– Constanza) and DR-12 (Constanza– Bonao). Despite these efforts, many secondary routes still remain either unpaved or in need of maintenance. There is currently a nationwide program to pave these and other commonly used routes. Also, the Santiago light rail system is in planning stages but currently on hold.|$|E
25|$|The neck is short, and derived species show a {{reduction}} in the number of cervical vertebrae. The short neck positions the skull close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk,</b> usually in a slight oblique elevation to it. Derived species usually also have a reduced number of dorsals, the total of presacral vertebrae totalling about forty to fifty. The vertebral column is little differentiated. Basal Ichthyopterygia still have two sacral vertebrae, but these are not fused. Early Triassic forms have a transversely flattened tail base with high spines for an undulating tail movement. Derived forms have a shorter tail with the characteristic kink at the end; a section of wedge-shaped vertebrae, itself supporting the fleshy upper tail fin lobe, forced the tail end into the lower fin lobe.|$|E
25|$|For 1966, the GT 350 {{lost its}} Mustang tag and was marketed {{simply as the}} Shelby GT 350. The new model year also saw the {{introduction}} of non-white colors, including blue, red, green, and black. Other changes included special rear quarter-panel windows replacing the factory extractor vents, functional brake scoops on each side, and optional SelectShift 3-speed automatic, {{as well as an}} optional Paxton supercharger. The battery was no longer relocated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> for 1966, and the over-rider traction bars were discontinued. The normal factory fold-down rear seat was optional. While early 1965 cars had black engine blocks, 1966 and later cars had their engines painted the regular factory Ford dark blue. The 1966 models came with a dual-exhaust exiting in the rear.|$|E

25|$|Gliding ants (gliding). The flightless {{workers of}} these insects have {{secondarily}} gained some capacity {{to move through}} the air. Gliding has evolved independently in a number of arboreal ant species from the groups Cephalotini, Pseudomyrmecinae, and Formicinae (mostly Camponotus). All arboreal dolichoderines and non-cephalotine myrmicines except Daceton armigerum do not glide. Living in the rainforest canopy like many other gliders, gliding ants use their gliding to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of the tree they live on should they fall or be knocked off a branch. Gliding was first discovered for Cephalotes atreus in the Peruvian rainforest. Cephalotes atreus can make 180 degree turns, and locate the trunk using visual cues, succeeding in landing 80% of the time. Unique among gliding animals, Cephalotini and Pseudomyrmecinae ants glide abdomen first, the Forminicae however glide in the more conventional head first manner. The following page has some good videos of gliding ants.|$|E
25|$|The World Logistics Hub is {{also part}} of the Airport City Enterprise Developments in South Manchester. This {{development}} is designed to meet the growing demand for cargo handling space and infrastructure outside of the southeast. Positioned on the southwest side of the A538 road next to the southeast side of the M56 motorway (across the A538 from the World Freight Terminal) providing access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> motorway network via Junction 6. DHL are the first tenant and are already using their shed. Another shed is now externally complete but the inside is now being fitted out in time for September when Amazon will move in. Over the next decade the site will generate around 10,000 jobs. As the site grows increased capacity will be added to the A538 with the extension of the dual carriageway between the M56 and runway tunnels and a traffic light controlled junction; improving access to the Runway Visitor Park and Romper pub.|$|E
25|$|On 1 December 1905, signalled by {{the arrival}} whistle of a locomotive's engine, the Malacca branch of the F.M.S. Railway was {{declared}} open, Acting Resident Councillor Bland having arrived at 6.30 a.m. at Kubu Station where he met R. C. Fryer, Firmstone, Lupton and Darbishire (the constructing engineer), after which they proceeded to Tampin, arriving there at 7.40. With the extension of rail services to Malacca, it was now possible to leave there at 1 p.m. and arrive at Penang at 6.21 a.m. the following day, instead of taking {{two or three days}} by steamer. The project had pushed ahead with speed. The first sod was cut on 9 June 1901 and plate laying commenced October 1904. Malacca's first engine was put together at the Malacca Yard, and steam was got up on 9 November 1904. The rails were joined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> line on 15 May and the laying of 2.5 miles of railway track completed by 1 December.|$|E
