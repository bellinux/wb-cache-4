Of the country's <b>total</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> of around 40.813 Million, the agricultural sector employs 30% of the labor force, and accounts for 14% of GDP.

5|$|The {{economical}} situation Tubas {{during the}} 199399 period was prosperous, however {{since the start}} of the Second Intifada in 200001, Tubas' income level has decreased by roughly 40%. Prior to the Intifada, the average household income was 2,500 NIS, receding to about 1,500 NIS. A major factor that has resulted from the conflict was the confiscation of agricultural land located within the city's or its governorate's jurisdiction by Israeli settlements or military authorities. According to the PCBS, in 1999, approximately 52% of the citizens were within the working age (15-64). Of the city's labor force, 48% are females. The unemployment rate increased dramatically from 20% in 1999 to 70% after the year 2000. Prior to the Intifada, 35% of the <b>total</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> worked in Israel.|$|E
25|$|After {{the return}} of democracy, {{the change in the}} status of women was dramatic. One {{significant}} indicator was the changing place of women in the work force. In the traditional Spanish world, women rarely entered the job market. By the late 1970s, however, 22 percent of the country's adult women, still somewhat fewer than in Italy and in Ireland, had entered the work force. By 1984 this figure had increased to 33 percent, a level not significantly different from Italy or the Netherlands. Women still made up less than one-third of the <b>total</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> however, and in some important sectors, such as banking, the figure was closer to one-tenth. A 1977 opinion poll revealed that when asked whether a woman's place was in the home only 22 percent of young people in Spain agreed, compared with 26 percent in Britain, 30 percent in Italy, and 37 percent in France. The principal barrier to women in the work place, however, was not public opinion, but rather such factors as a high unemployment rate and a lack of part-time jobs. In education, women were rapidly achieving parity with men, at least statistically. In 1983, approximately 46 percent of Spain's university enrollment was female, the thirty-first highest percentage in the world, and comparable to most other European countries.|$|E

If a section of the {{redundant}} agricultural <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> (PQ) is removed from the <b>total</b> agricultural <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> (OP) and absorbed into the industrial sector, then the <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> remaining in the industrial sector is represented by the point Y. Now, the output produced by the remaining <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> is represented by YZ and the real income of this <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> is given by XY. The difference of the two terms yields the total agricultural surplus of the economy. It is important to understand that this surplus is produced by the reallocation of labor such that it is absorbed by the industrial sector. This can be seen as deployment of hidden rural savings for the expansion of the industrial sector. Hence, we can understand the contribution of the agricultural sector to the expansion of industrial sector by this allocation of redundant <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> and the agricultural surplus that results from it.|$|R
