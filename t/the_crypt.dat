5|$|<b>The</b> <b>crypt</b> under Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral is {{the only}} part that was built {{according}} to Lutyens' design before construction stopped due to World War II; in 1962 Frederick Gibberd's design was built upon the Lutyens crypt. Structurally <b>the</b> <b>crypt</b> is built of brick together with granite from quarries in Penryn, Cornwall. Each year <b>the</b> <b>crypt</b> plays host to the Liverpool Beer Festival which attracts visitors, not only from all over UK but also Europe and places such as the United States and Australia. <b>The</b> <b>crypt</b> also hosts examinations for students at the University of Liverpool during exam periods.|$|E

Living {{as he did}} for hundreds of years, he outlived a lot of people. The stonework is a distinctive ochre hue. Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk removed the passageway that led to stairs from the surface ruins, connecting <b>the</b> <b>crypts</b> only to Zagig's Gauntlet.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>crypts</b> of Fuchs are {{a series}} of {{openings}} located {{on either side of the}} collarette that allow the stroma and deeper iris tissues to be bathed in aqueous humor. Collagen trabeculae that surround the border of <b>the</b> <b>crypts</b> can be seen in blue irises.|$|R
5|$|On {{each side}} on the entry of the cathedral is a stone {{crucifix}} and a holy water font. High {{on the left side}} there is a brick from the Lateran Basilica, and on the right side a jubilee 2000 medal. <b>The</b> <b>crypt</b> is accessed through the door in the right wall of the vestibule, then up to the organ matroneum and finally down through the door on the left wall. In <b>the</b> <b>crypt,</b> there is an oratory, as well as Catechism rooms and the office of the Caritas charity.|$|E
5|$|Several of Gaudí's {{works have}} been granted World Heritage status by UNESCO: in 1984 the Park Güell, the Palau Güell and the Casa Milà; and in 2005 the Nativity facade, <b>the</b> <b>crypt</b> and the apse of the Sagrada Família, the Casa Vicens and the Casa Batlló in Barcelona, {{together}} with <b>the</b> <b>crypt</b> of the Colònia Güell in Santa Coloma de Cervelló.|$|E
5|$|The fort is {{supposedly}} {{haunted by the}} Black Knight, who wears the armour and regalia of the Order of St. John, and resembles Grand Master de Vilhena. In the 1940s, the knight began to appear {{out of thin air}} near the ruins of the Chapel of St. Anthony of Padua, which had just been bombed in World War II. The apparition was reportedly seen by Maltese and English men within the fort. When the rubble from the ruined chapel began to be cleared, the workmen reported that the knight was supervising their work. When <b>the</b> <b>crypt</b> beneath the chapel was opened, it was found that it had been vandalized, and the remains of knights which had been buried there were scattered around. After <b>the</b> <b>crypt</b> was restored and the bones were reburied, the Black Knight stopped appearing. In 1980, <b>the</b> <b>crypt</b> was vandalized for a second time, and the Black Knight reportedly began to appear again.|$|E
50|$|SSAs are {{diagnosed}} by their microscopic appearance; histomorphologically, they {{are characterized by}} (1) basal dilation of <b>the</b> <b>crypts,</b> (2) basal crypt serration, (3) crypts that run horizontal to the basement membrane (horizontal crypts), and (4) <b>crypt</b> branching. <b>The</b> most common of these features is basal dilation of <b>the</b> <b>crypts.</b>|$|R

5|$|Dating {{from the}} 7th century to 1522, Ripon Cathedral {{preserves}} <b>the</b> <b>crypt</b> {{of the original}} church built by Saint Wilfred. The west front is an unaltered and harmonious composition in Early English Gothic. The choir has retained richly carved 14th-century stalls, famous for the many lively figures among the carvings.|$|E
5|$|From 1915 Gaudí devoted himself almost {{exclusively}} to his magnum opus, the Sagrada Família, a synthesis of his architectural evolution. After completion of <b>the</b> <b>crypt</b> and the apse, still in Gothic style, {{the rest of the}} church is conceived in an organic style, imitating natural shapes with their abundance of ruled surfaces. He intended the interior to resemble a forest, with inclined columns like branching trees, helicoidal in form, creating a simple but sturdy structure. Gaudí applied all of his previous experimental findings in this project, from works such as the Park Güell and <b>the</b> <b>crypt</b> of the Colònia Güell, creating a church that is at once structurally perfect, harmonious and aesthetically satisfying.|$|E
50|$|Macrophages {{and other}} {{white blood cells}} {{concentrate}} by <b>the</b> tonsillar <b>crypts</b> as well, {{in response to the}} microorganisms attracted to <b>the</b> <b>crypts.</b> Accordingly, <b>the</b> tonsillar <b>crypts</b> serve a forward sentry role for the immune system, by providing early exposure of immune system cells to infectious organisms which may be introduced into the body via food or other ingested matter.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>crypts</b> extend through <b>the</b> full {{thickness}} of the tonsil reaching almost to its hemicapsule. In healthy tonsils the openings of <b>the</b> <b>crypts</b> are fissure-like, and {{the walls of the}} lumina are in apposition. A computerized three-dimensional reconstruction of <b>the</b> palatine tonsil <b>crypt</b> system showed that in the centre of the palatine tonsil are tightly packed ramified crypts that join with each other, while on the periphery there is a rather simple and sparse arrangement.|$|R

5|$|St Chad's Church {{collapsed}} in 1788 after attempts to expand <b>the</b> <b>crypt</b> compromised the structural {{integrity of the}} tower above; it was, however, rebuilt just four years later as a large neo-classical round church in a new location close to the Quarry Park.|$|E
5|$|The final {{project for}} his great patron Eusebi Güell was {{the church for}} the Colònia Güell, an {{industrial}} village in Santa Coloma de Cervelló (1890–1918). The project began in 1890, and the factory, service buildings and housing for the workers were constructed. What {{would have been the}} colony's church was designed by Gaudí in 1898, though the first stone was not laid until 4 October 1908. Unfortunately only <b>the</b> <b>crypt</b> (known today as Crypt of the Colònia Güell) was built, as Güell's sons abandoned the project after his death in 1918. Gaudí designed an oval church with five aisles, one central aisle and two at either side. He conceived it as fully integrated into nature. A porch of hyperbolic paraboloid vaults precedes <b>the</b> <b>crypt,</b> the first time that Gaudí used this structure and notably the first use of paraboloid vaults in the history of architecture. In <b>the</b> <b>crypt</b> the large hyperboloid stained glass windows stand out, with the shapes of flower petals and butterfly wings. Inside, circular brick pillars alternate with slanted basalt columns from Castellfollit de la Roca.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively {{known as}} the Carnary chapel and college, the complex was {{originally}} formed of separate buildings which were later joined together. The entrance porch to the chapel was added between 1446 and 1472 during the episcopate of Walter Lyhart, Bishop of Norwich. <b>The</b> <b>crypt</b> beneath the chapel {{was used as a}} charnel house administered by the sacristan of the cathedral which stored the bones of people buried in the churches of the city to await resurrection, and the ocular windows of the chapel would allow visitors to view the charnel remains. From 1421 to 1476 <b>the</b> <b>crypt</b> was also the location of the Wodehous chantry, established by Henry V at the request of John Wodehous, a veteran of the Battle of Agincourt. The college was dissolved in 1547 during the English Reformation by the Abolition of Chantries Act before being purchased by the city in 1550, and used by the school shortly after. Until the 19th century the chapel was used as the main classroom, though it was not until 1908 the chapel returned to the role of religious assembly and 1940 when it was consecrated for use as a church, due to the cost of refurbishment.|$|E

5|$|Inside {{the walls}} the tower {{included}} a crypt chapel, {{which may be}} the site of a previous church. <b>The</b> <b>crypt</b> chapel originally had a nave, chancel and an apsidal sanctuary. It is a typical early Norman design with solid pillars and arches. In 1074 D'Oyly and his close friend, Roger d'Ivry endowed a chapel with a college of priests. At an early stage it acquired a dedication to Saint George.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} known that under the church was a vault {{containing}} the remains of {{some members of the}} Stanley family but its whereabouts were not known until they were discovered by an architect in 2007. A stone slab was removed exposing steps leading to a crypt under the chancel. This contained six coffins, four of which contained the bodies of the first and second LordsStanley and their wives. Once the details had been recorded, <b>the</b> <b>crypt</b> was resealed.|$|E
