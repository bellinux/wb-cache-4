5|$|Siva {{explores the}} {{exploitation}} of students by anti-social elements against a mafia backdrop and the impact on them of crowd psychology. It also focuses on politics and betrayal in the scene where Bhavani murders Machiraju and his enemy Viswanadham. As a student, Varma observed and participated in gang wars and student politics besides analysing {{the impact of a}} gangster's lifestyle and body language on students. <b>Those</b> <b>experiences</b> inspired him to begin writing Siva.|$|E
5|$|Symeon {{wrote in}} a similar style and taught the {{traditional}} views of several early Christian fathers and hesychasts, including St. Augustine, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Mark the Hermit. Where Symeon differed from his predecessors was in his transparent and open sharing of his most interior experiences. Symeon was the first Byzantine mystic to freely share <b>those</b> <b>experiences,</b> which were given {{in the context of}} his teaching that the direct experience of God was something to which all Christians could aspire.|$|E
5|$|The raid was {{preceded by}} the escape of seven POWs on 30 August 1944. The organisers of the escape were Private Ralph Frederick Churches, an Australian Army {{infantry}} soldier of the 2/48th Battalion {{who had been on}} temporary duty with Headquarters ANZAC Corps when he was captured during the Allied withdrawal from Greece in April–May 1941, and Driver Leslie Arthur Laws, a British Army soldier of the 127th (Dorset) Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Royal Engineers. By August 1944, Churches had already attempted to escape on two occasions and had learned about the surroundings from <b>those</b> <b>experiences.</b> He realised that he had to escape while the prisoners were in an environment hostile to the Germans. Churches had learned to speak passable German during his captivity, and had been the camp leader of the work camp for eighteen months when he resigned the role so he could be involved in the escape.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{study was}} conducted to evaluate and better understand the attitudes and perceptions <b>those</b> <b>experiencing</b> homelessness have toward fast food. While previous research has studied <b>those</b> <b>experiencing</b> homelessness and their consumption of fast food, little to no research has been done to qualitatively assess what they think about fast food. This study was a qualitative phenomenology conducted through interviews with nineteen adults currently experiencing homelessness in a medium-sized city in the Mid-Atlantic U. S. Some insights <b>those</b> <b>experiencing</b> homelessness had toward fast food focused on the topics of health, cost, availability, necessity, and experience. Implications of this study include a better understanding of <b>those</b> <b>experiencing</b> homelessness and opportunities {{to improve the quality of}} life for <b>those</b> <b>experiencing</b> homelessness, especially in the area of nutrition and daily diet...|$|R

25|$|The first {{empirical}} research {{about the social}} sharing of emotions was conducted in 1991. These were retrospective studies where participants filled out a questionnaire which asked them to recall a specific personal experience that provoked an emotion. They then {{were asked to respond}} to questions related to their social sharing behaviors related to that event. In all of these studies, 88–96% of emotional experiences were followed by social sharing of <b>those</b> <b>experiences</b> at least one time.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that in certain {{situations}} people share personal or emotional information with non-intimate others, data shows that the target of the social sharing is usually a close relative or an intimate other, about 85% of the time. However, a paradox arises when considering the secondary social sharing of emotions; on the one hand, socially sharing an emotional experience with an intimate other presupposes confidentiality, yet in the majority of cases <b>those</b> <b>experiences</b> become the subject of secondary sharing to other people.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Douglas {{returned}} to New York City and found work in radio, theater and commercials. In his radio work, he {{acted in a}} number of network soap operas, and sees <b>those</b> <b>experiences</b> as being especially valuable, as skill in using one's voice is important for aspiring actors, and regrets that the same avenues are no longer open to them. His stage break occurred when he took over the role played by Richard Widmark in Kiss and Tell (1943), which then led to other offers.|$|E
25|$|Nine days later, Sister Elisabeth {{helped found}} the Norwegian Relief Society, thus {{establishing}} her American ministry. Pastor Andreas Mortensen, whom Gabriel Fedde had served as secretary (after marrying the sister of the Swedish/Norwegian consul in New York), presided over the service establishing the society. Sister Elizabeth established a boarding house at 109 Williams Street, near the Seaman’s Church (where Rev. Mortensen served), and rented out three small rooms at $9 per month. Sister Elisabeth also often visited the sick and distressed poor; her diary about <b>those</b> <b>experiences</b> was later published.|$|E
25|$|He was {{nominated}} for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his portrayal of pool shark Minnesota Fats in The Hustler (1961), starring Paul Newman. Gleason made all his own trick pool shots. (In his 1985 appearance on The Tonight Show, Gleason told Johnny Carson that he had played pool frequently since childhood, and drew from <b>those</b> <b>experiences</b> in The Hustler.) He was extremely well-received as a beleaguered boxing manager in the movie version of Rod Serling's Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962). Gleason played a world-weary army sergeant in Soldier in the Rain (1963), in which he received top billing over Steve McQueen.|$|E

25|$|James Mensch {{provided}} {{an understanding of}} imagining the experiences of others (what can also be called empathic envisioning) and what that might look like {{when he talked about}} literary imagination humans: the capacity of humans to imagine the experiences of characters in novels. Mensch explained that human beings' embodiment provides them with the capacity to imagine these experiences and then relate to them through empathy. For Mensch, people are only capable of having experiences because of and through their body. Humans (Dasein) experience life, others, the world, etc. via their bodies which can taste, smell, hear, feel, and see. More to the point, their bodies encapsulate our various mental faculties required for processing and retaining <b>those</b> <b>experiences.</b> This means human experiences are experiences of the body. Relating to others then is when two bodies experience one another: they inter-relate. Because humans (Dasein) hold their bodily experiences in their memory, they are able to use our literary imagination to envision the experiences of characters in novels.|$|E
25|$|Ricoeur also {{invoked the}} notion of distanciation when {{interpreting}} and understanding others. For Ricoeur, distanciation is two-fold: a) humans always interpret from a distanced position via their physical and experiential proximity to the experiences being discussed (i.e., they were not always there when it happened), and b) {{there will always be}} a distance between their experiences and their interpreted truths and meaning of <b>those</b> <b>experiences.</b> While imagination enables hermeneutic therapists to understand their clients and empathize with their experiences, {{there will always be a}} distance between what the therapist imagines and the actual embodied experience of the client. Ironically, it is this concept of distanciation that invokes the therapist's responsibility to make the attempt, to get as close as is possible, because without breaching that surface, truth and meaning are limited in their co-creation. Hermeneutic counseling theory states that a therapist and a client cannot work together to co-create meaning without empathically envisioning and understanding one another.|$|E

500|$|God's {{consequent}} nature, on {{the other}} hand, is anything but unchanging – it is God's reception of the world's activity. [...] As Whitehead puts it, [...] " [...] saves {{the world as it}} passes into the immediacy of his own life. [...] It is the judgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved." [...] In other words, God saves and cherishes all experiences forever, and <b>those</b> <b>experiences</b> go on to change the way God interacts with the world. [...] In this way, God is really changed by what happens {{in the world and the}} wider universe, lending the actions of finite creatures an eternal significance.|$|E
500|$|Noé {{had tried}} various {{hallucinogens}} in his youth, and used <b>those</b> <b>experiences</b> as {{inspiration for the}} visual style. Later, when the director was already planning the film, he tried the psychoactive brew ayahuasca, in which the active substance is DMT. This {{was done in the}} Peruvian jungle, where the brew is legal due to its traditional use as an entheogen. Noé described the experience as very intense, and said he regarded it [...] "almost like professional research." [...] Since few on the design team had ever taken a hallucinogen, it was necessary for Noé to collect and provide visual references in the forms of paintings, photographs, music videos, and excerpts from films. One reference used was the works of biologist Ernst Haeckel, whose drawings influenced the organic patterns seen during Oscar's visions.|$|E

500|$|Vargas Llosa has mainly {{lived in}} Madrid since the 1990s, but spends roughly {{three months of}} the year in Peru with his {{extended}} family. He also frequently visits London where he occasionally spends long periods. Vargas Llosa acquired Spanish citizenship in 1993, though he still holds Peruvian nationality. The writer often reiterates his love for both countries. In his Nobel speech he observed: [...] "I carry Peru deep inside me because that is where I was born, grew up, was formed, and lived <b>those</b> <b>experiences</b> of childhood and youth that shaped my personality and forged my calling". He then added: [...] "I love Spain as much as Peru, and my debt to her is as great as my gratitude. If not for Spain, I never would have reached this podium or become a known writer".|$|E
500|$|In San Diego, Theresa Scher, a {{stripper}} and call girl, {{was looking for}} {{a way out of the}} sex industry when she watched a CNN interview with Albee about her work with JC's Girls in Riverside. Scher contacted Albee, who allowed Scher to establish a new chapter of JC's Girls in San Diego. Scher founded the chapter in 2007 with Sheri Brown, a former social worker. Brown had previously hated strippers, but, once she had accepted a job helping teenage mothers finish high school and the first four teens she worked with were strippers, she said that she developed [...] "an overwhelming passion to reach out to these precious women in love and without condemnation." [...] She has described being sexually abused as a child and later being a teenage mother; Brown found that both of these experiences helped her to relate to strippers, as many of the strippers she encountered also had <b>those</b> <b>experiences.</b>|$|E

Although Chen was interested in art and drawing as a young child, his father influenced him towards computers, entering him in programming contests from when he was 10 years old. He found himself interested in video games that he saw there, but was not as enthusiastic about programming. While a teenager, he had deep emotional experiences with games that he played, including The Legend of Sword and Fairy, which he ascribes {{to the fact that}} he was not as exposed to books, films, or life events that other people would have had <b>those</b> <b>experiences</b> with. These experiences drove him to try to create those types of feelings in games as an adult, when more emotional maturity had caused his [...] "standards to rise" [...] in what would move him in a game. It was during high school that he chose the English name Jenova after a character in Final Fantasy VII, wanting a name that would be unique anywhere he used it as there were [...] "thousands of Jason Chens".|$|E
