25|$|When the Soviet Union was {{dissolved}} and {{the fifteen}} {{republics of the}} Soviet Union became independent states, the copyright law of the USSR also split into fifteen independent copyright laws, {{each with its own}} jurisdiction defined by the territory of the new successor state of the Soviet Union. All these successor states initially took over <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> legislation.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Fidel Castro, in {{agreement}} with Raúl Castro's reformist sentiment, admitted that the Cuban model based on <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> model of centralized planning was no longer sustainable. They encouraged {{the creation of a}} co-operative variant of socialism where the state plays a less active role in the economy and the formation of worker-owned co-operatives and self-employment enterprises.|$|E

50|$|Maersk also {{secured a}} 49-percent stake in Estonian Air, after having beaten SAS in a {{privatization}} tender. Two of Maersk Air's Fokker 50s were leased to Estonian Air, who also took delivery of two 737-500s, replacing <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> fleet.|$|R
50|$|After the {{collapse}} of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>Soviet</b> paper founded in 1903, Pravda, split into three different papers. Significant members of the main editorial staff (Viktor Afanasiev, Gennady Seleznev, Yuri Zhukov, Vera Tkachenko and Vadim Gorshenin) left Pravda to form the online news & opinion website Pravda.ru.|$|R
25|$|In April 2008, a new {{memorial}} to Yeltsin was dedicated in Moscow's Novodevichy cemetery, to mixed reactions. At the memorial service, a military chorus performed Russia's national anthem – an anthem that was changed {{shortly after the}} end of Yeltsin's term, to follow the music of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> anthem, with lyrics reflecting Russia's new status.|$|E
25|$|The {{analysis}} of the succession of states {{with respect to the}} 15 post-Soviet states is complex. The Russian Federation is seen as the legal continuator state and is for most purposes the heir to the Soviet Union. It retained ownership of all former Soviet embassy properties, as well as <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> UN membership and permanent membership on the Security Council.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, many of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> landmarks, such as Rossiya Hotel or Voentorg, were reconstructed or demolished, {{as well as}} such {{historical}} buildings as several old buildings around the Kadashi Church in {{the proximity of the}} Moscow Kremlin. Many neighbourhoods, like Zamoskvorechye, have been dramatically changed. Sculptor Zurab Tsereteli enjoyed Luzhkov's personal support in setting many of his works over the city.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of Government of the Russian Federation {{from the time}} the state formed in 1991 underwent several major changes. In the first years governing bodies, primarily different Ministries, were under massive reorganizations in order to adopt <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> governing networks to the new form of state. Many reshufflings and renamings were made.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 the Bulgarian {{government}} {{signed a}} contract with Alenia Aeronautica for the delivery of five C-27J Spartan transport aircraft in order to replace <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> An-24 and An-26. The first Spartan arrived in 2007. Now, the contract has changed to the delivery of only 3 planes and final plane arrived on 31 March 2011.|$|R
25|$|The first post-Soviet {{copyright}} {{law of the}} Russian Federation became effective on August 3, 1993. It completely replaced <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> legislation {{that had been in}} effect until then. The new Copyright law of 1993 was based upon WIPO model laws and followed the continental European tradition: it clearly separated economic and moral rights, and it included detailed provisions for neighbouring rights.|$|R
25|$|On July 19, 1995, Federal Law 110-FL {{changed the}} {{copyright}} law, strengthening the measures for protecting copyrights against infringements. Law 110-FL also made corresponding amendments in the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and in related laws. Three years later, a governmental decree clarified that for Soviet films, {{the director and}} other persons identified by the 1993 law as authors were indeed to be considered the authors and entitled to royalties for uses of these films, and not, as had been the case under <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> law, the film studios.|$|E
25|$|Economic reforms also {{consolidated}} a semi-criminal oligarchy {{with roots}} in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> system. Advised by Western governments, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, Russia embarked on {{the largest and}} fastest privatization that the world had ever seen in order to reform the fully nationalized Soviet economy. By mid-decade, retail, trade, services, and small industry was in private hands. Most big enterprises were acquired by their old managers, engendering a new rich (Russian tycoons) in league with criminal mafias or Western investors. That being said, there were corporate raiders such as Andrei Volgin engaged in hostile takeovers of corrupt corporations by the mid-1990s.|$|E
25|$|Further Russian public {{holidays}} include Defender of the Fatherland Day (23 February), which honors Russian men, especially those {{serving in the}} army; International Women's Day (8 March), which combines the traditions of Mother's Day and Valentine's Day; International Workers' Day (1 May), now renamed Spring and Labor Day; Victory Day (9 May); Russia Day (12 June); and Unity Day (4 November), commemorating the popular uprising which expelled the Polish-Lithuanian occupation force from Moscow in 1612. The latter is a replacement for <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> holiday celebrating October Revolution of 1917 (again, it was falling on November because of the difference of calendars). Fireworks and outdoor concerts are common features of all Russian {{public holidays}}.|$|E
2500|$|Geller {{played in}} 23 USSR Chess Championships, a record equalled by Mark Taimanov, {{achieving}} good results in many. He won in 1955 at Moscow (URS-ch22) when, despite losing five games, he finished equal first with 12/19, then defeated Smyslov in the playoff match by the score of +1 =6. He won his second title in 1979 at Minsk (URS-ch47) {{at the age}} of 54, making him <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>Soviet</b> champion.|$|R
5000|$|The LUGM-145 was an Iraqi {{produced}} naval moored contact mine. The mine had a 145 kilogram explosive warhead, and {{was basically}} a modern version of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> M-08 mine. In February 1991, during the Gulf War, [...] struck a LUGM-145 mine, losing {{a third of its}} fuel, and sustaining damage that would cost 3.5 million US dollars to repair.|$|R
2500|$|Soon afterwards, Botvinnik was {{informed}} that Alexander Ilyin-Genevsky, one of <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> masters {{and a member of}} the Soviet embassy in Prague, had arranged a match between Botvinnik [...] and Salo Flohr, a Czech grandmaster who was then regarded as one of the most credible contenders for Alexander Alekhine's World Chess Championship title. The highest-level chess officials in the Soviet Union opposed this on the grounds that Botvinnik stood little chance against such a strong international opponent. In spite of this attempt to dissuade him, Krylenko insisted on staging the match, saying that [...] "We have to know our real strength." ...|$|R
25|$|Under the 1993 {{copyright}} law, all Russian or Soviet {{works from}} the RSFSR published in 1943 or later, as well as works of authors who died in 1943 or later, became thus copyrighted in Russia in 1993. Because of the term extension of four years for authors who had lived during the Great Patriotic War, even some earlier works became subject to copyright. In the case of works formerly copyrighted under Soviet law, this amounted to a restoration of copyright; for the neighbouring rights, which hadn't existed in Soviet times, the law granted those rights retroactively. The 1993 copyright law thus rendered <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> legislation largely obsolete in Russia; the former laws remained applicable only to copyright violations that had occurred before August 3, 1993.|$|E
25|$|A new {{military}} doctrine, promulgated in November 1993, implicitly acknowledged the contraction of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> military into a regional military power without global ambitions. In keeping {{with its emphasis}} on the threat of regional conflicts, the doctrine called for a smaller, lighter, and more mobile Russian military, with a higher degree of professionalism and with greater rapid-deployment capability. Such change proved extremely difficult to achieve. Under Pavel Grachev (Defence Minister from 1992 to 1996) little military reform took place, though there was a plan to create more deployable mobile forces. Later Defence Minister Rodionov (in office 1996-1997) had good qualifications but did not manage to institute lasting change. Only under Defence Minister Igor Sergeyev (in office 1997-2001) did a certain amount of limited reform begin, though attention focused upon the Strategic Rocket Forces.|$|E
25|$|As the Soviet Union officially {{dissolved}} on December 31, 1991, the Soviet {{military was}} left in limbo. For {{the next year and}} a half various attempts to keep its unity and transform it into the military of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) failed. Steadily, the units stationed in Ukraine and some other breakaway republics swore loyalty to their new national governments, while a series of treaties between the newly independent states divided up the military's assets. In mid-March 1992, Yeltsin appointed himself as the new Russian minister of defence, marking a crucial step {{in the creation of the}} new Russian armed forces, comprising the bulk of what was still left of the military. The last vestiges of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> command structure were finally dissolved in June 1993.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the birth}} of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the {{aftermath}} of the dissolution of the USSR, <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> unit colours were retained. Starting in 1998, the traditional Imperial Russian Armed Forces flag designs were reinstated; however, the new designs began to appear in the early years of the 21st century in the Army and Air Force. But the Russian Navy's old naval colour (St. Andrew's cross in blue on a white field) began to be used again in 1992. It has several variations, and the old jack colour of the Soviet Navy (pre-1935) soon became its jack colour, with the red star with the hammer and sickle removed. The unit colours (especially those of the Navy honour guards) have the same design with the unit insignia at the centre of it while Guards units and bemerited and decorated units apply a different version of the colour.|$|E
25|$|Glasnost had {{inadvertently}} {{released the}} long-suppressed national sentiments of all peoples within {{the borders of}} the multinational Soviet state. These nationalist movements were further strengthened by the rapid deterioration of the Soviet economy, whose ramshackle foundations were exposed with the removal of Communist discipline. Gorbachev's reforms had failed to improve the economy, with <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> command structure completely breaking down. One by one, the constituent republics created their own economic systems and voted to subordinate Soviet laws to local laws. In 1990, the Communist Party was forced to surrender its seven-decade monopoly of political power when the Supreme Soviet rescinded the clause in the Soviet Constitution that guaranteed its sole authority to rule. Gorbachev's policies caused the Communist Party to lose its grip over the media. Details of the Soviet Union's past were quickly being declassified. This caused many to distrust the 'old system' and push for greater autonomy and independence.|$|E
25|$|The {{implementation}} act {{for the new}} copyright law, law no. 5352-1 of July 9, 1993, {{stated that}} the copyright provisions from the 1991 Fundamentals were invalidated. It also stated that the new copyright law applied to all works on which the 50-year term for copyrights and neighbouring rights had not yet elapsed in 1993. Subsequently, a discussion amongst copyright specialists erupted about whether this made the law applied retroactively, restoring copyrights on works on which the shorter copyright terms from the Soviet-era had already expired or which had not been copyrighted at all under Soviet law. The question was resolved definitively only in 2006, when the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation confirmed the retroactivity of the 1993 law, explaining that it placed even works under copyright again if their old, Soviet 25-year term had already expired. For the neighbouring rights, which hadn't existed in Soviet times, the law granted those rights retroactively. The 1993 copyright law thus rendered <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> legislation largely obsolete in Russia; it remained applicable only to copyright violations that had occurred before August 3, 1993.|$|E

40|$|Containment {{structures}} for nuclear reactors are the final barrier between released radionuclides and the public. Containment structures are constructed from steel, reinforced concrete, or prestressed concrete. US nuclear reactor containment geometries {{tend to be}} cylindrical with elliptical or hemispherical heads. <b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> designed reactors do not use a containment building to mitigate the effects of accidents. Instead, they employ a sealed set of rectilinear, interconnected compartments, collectively called the accident localization system (ALS), to reduce the release of radionuclides to the atmosphere during accidents. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a methodology that can be used to find the structural capacity of reinforced concrete structures. The method is applicable to both cylindrical and rectilinear geometries. As an illustrative example, the methodology is applied to a generic VVER- 440 /V 213 design...|$|R
500|$|In a November {{session of}} the Federation Council, Putin stated that {{establishing}} the national symbols (anthem, flag and coat of arms) should be a top priority for the country. Putin pressed for the former Soviet anthem to be selected as the new Russian anthem, but strongly suggested that new lyrics be written. He did not say how much of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> lyrics should be retained for the new anthem. Putin submitted the bill [...] "On the National Anthem of the Russian Federation" [...] to the Duma for their consideration on 4 December. The Duma voted 381–51–1 in favor of adopting Alexandrov's music as the national anthem on 8 December 2000. Following the vote, a committee was formed and tasked with exploring lyrics for the national anthem. After receiving over 6,000 manuscripts from all sectors of Russian society, the committee selected lyrics by Mikhalkov for the anthem.|$|E
500|$|Journalist Catherine Putz {{commented on}} the phrase in a 2016 article for the {{international}} news magazine The Diplomat, and compared it to use of whataboutism by businessman and politician Donald Trump: [...] "Criticisms {{of human rights in}} the Soviet Union were often met with what became a common catchphrase: 'And you are lynching Negroes'." [...] She pointed out the folly of its use: [...] "It demands, by default, for a state to argue abroad only in favor of ideals it has achieved the highest perfection in." [...] Writing for the liberal Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Israeli journalist Chemi Shalev made a similar comparison: [...] "Trump told the New York Times this week that America is in such a mess in terms of civil liberties that it cannot lecture foreign countries anymore, which is an echo of old Soviet propaganda that responded to American reprimands with the retort 'And you are lynching Negroes'." [...] Shalev followed-up on this analysis in a subsequent article, writing: [...] "Trump conducts pro-Russian propaganda along the same lines as the old retort 'And You Hang Blacks' with which the Soviets tried to deflect U.S. criticism of their human rights abuses. He isn't troubled by Putin's political opponents being murdered, because 'people get killed here too'." [...] Writing for ChinaFile after Trump won the 2016 U.S. election, James Palmer feared an increase in racism [...] "would give a brutal new credibility to <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> whataboutism whenever they were challenged on the gulag: 'But in America, you lynch Negroes'." [...] In her work Security Threats and Public Perception, Elizaveta Gaufman characterized the phrase as a form of reversing someone's line of reasoning against them. Gaufman wrote that by using this phrase in an argument, one was tacitly refusing to answer queries posted to them and instead responding with condemnations.|$|E
