5|$|The classic legionary scutum, a convex {{rectangular}} shield, also disappeared {{during the}} 3rd century. All troops except archers adopted large, wide, usually dished, ovoid (or sometimes round) shields. These shields were still called Scuta or Clipei, despite {{the difference in}} shape. Shields, from examples found at Dura Europos and Nydam, were of vertical plank construction, <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> glued, and mostly faced inside and out with painted leather. The edges of the shield were bound with stitched rawhide, which shrank as it dried improving structural cohesion.|$|E
5|$|FIAT driver Aldo Weilschott {{climbed from}} fourteenth on lap three to third on lap five, before his car rolled off <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> outside Vibraye.

Despite a slow start, FIAT driver Felice Nazzaro moved up to third position, 15minutes behind Clément. Seventeen cars completed the first day; Henri Rougier's Lorraine-Dietrich finished last with a time of 8:15:55.0, two-and-a-half-hours behind Szisz. All the cars that were competing the next day were moved into parc fermé, a floodlit area guarded overnight by members of the ACF, to prevent teams and drivers from working on them until the following morning.|$|E
5|$|Modern day native {{groups such}} as the Yurok, Tolowa, Karok, Chilula, and Wiyot all have {{historical}} ties to the region, and some Native American groups still live in the park area today. Archaeological study shows they arrived in the area as far back as 3,000 years ago. An 1852 census determined that the Yurok were the most numerous, with 55 villages and an estimated population of 2,500. They used the abundant redwood, which with its linear grain was easily split into planks, as a building material for boats, houses, and small villages. For buildings, <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> would be erected side by side in a narrow trench, with the upper portions bound with leather strapping and held by notches cut into the supporting roof beams. Redwood boards were used to form a shallow sloping roof.|$|E

A lock of Maria's hair sold for two guineas. Polstead became a tourist venue with visitors travelling from as far afield as Ireland; Curtis estimated that 200,000 people visited Polstead in 1828 alone. The Red Barn and the Martens' cottage excited particular interest. The barn was stripped for souvenirs, down to <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> being removed from the sides, broken up, and sold as toothpicks. It was slated to be demolished after the trial, but it was left standing and eventually burned down in 1842. Even Maria's gravestone in the churchyard of St Mary's, Polstead was eventually chipped away to nothing by souvenir hunters; only {{a sign on the}} shed now marks the approximate place where it stood, although her name is given to Marten's Lane in the village. Pottery models and sketches were sold and songs were composed, including one quoted in the Vaughan Williams opera Hugh the Drover and Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus.|$|E
5|$|Route 12 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1909 from San Diego to El Centro, and Route 27 was added from El Centro to Yuma in 1915. Before a highway was {{constructed}} through the Imperial San Dunes, travelers had to pass to the north in order to reach Yuma. The first route through Imperial Valley was originally a plank road made of pieces of wood that were tied together. The road was completed by October 1912, and portions were still visible into the 2010s. The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915, and a new plank road was opened that year which became state-maintained in 1917, and used a foundation of wooden rails, with <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> bound together by steel, as opposed to simple planks that were fastened to rails. However, traffic congestion and dusty conditions made travel along the plank road difficult. The delay in constructing a road to San Diego caused increased development in Los Angeles and resulted in that city becoming the trade and population center of Southern California.|$|E

25|$|Before Schumacher's appeal {{from his}} {{disqualification}} at the British Grand Prix, he was disqualified from the Belgian Grand Prix as his Benetton had excessive wear of <b>the</b> <b>plank.</b> <b>The</b> FIA allowed <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> to be ten millimetres deep, with an allowance of one millimetre meaning that <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> {{must be a}} minimum of nine millimetres to be deemed legal. A majority of <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> on Schumacher's car measured 7.4 millimetres, 1.6 under the legal tolerance. Benetton, along with Schumacher, claimed that <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> had excessive wear due to a spin by Schumacher during the race. Benetton launched an immediate appeal, with a World Motor Sport Council meeting set for September 5. The allegations of Benetton cheating throughout the summer of 1994 led to rumours of Schumacher quitting the team. The team released a statement denying the rumours, stating that Schumacher would complete the season.|$|R

25|$|A further {{development}} {{was the use}} of timber frames, to which <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> could be lashed, stitched or nailed.

25|$|To scholars, {{the use of}} unpegged joints seems odd, if not eccentric, and is {{not found}} in well established, ancient Mediterranean {{shipbuilding}} traditions.

40|$|Purpose: <b>The</b> <b>plank</b> {{exercise}} {{is a popular}} and widely used exercise to increase core strength. We previously established normative values for <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> exercise {{that may be used}} for fitness classification to identify gaps in core muscular strength and endurance. Whether <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> exercise can be confidently added to current fitness appraisal protocols will depend on its reliability and validity in the fitness testing environment. This study sought to examine test-retest reliability of <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> exercise and to compare plank performance with established normative values for the curl up test. The role of verbal encouragement cues during plank performance testing was also assessed. Methods: Collegiate male (n= 14) and female participants (n= 19) performed <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> exercise in two separate sessions separated by a minimum of 72 hr. Participants maintained <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> position until complete fatigue was reached. Verbal cues were given to half of the participants in one of the two sessions. Performance on the curl up exercise was measured in a third, separate session. Results: Intraclass correlation showed that mean time held in <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> position was not significantly different between <b>the</b> two <b>plank</b> testing sessions (108. 15 + 49. 38 versus 111. 39 + 56. 87 seconds, p= 0. 556). Verbal encouragement cues did not improve performance time (between group effect, p= 0. 940). The curl up test was not significantly correlated with either plank session (r= 0. 410 and 0. 276 for plank session one and two, respectively). Surprisingly, the curl up test was positively correlated with participant height (r= 0. 578). Conclusion: This study suggests that <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> {{exercise is}} a reliable test; plank performance was comparable across testing sessions and not influenced by verbal encouragement. Further testing is needed to confirm validity of <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> exercise as a measure of core muscular endurance. We show here that plank performance was not correlated with the standard curl up test. However, the curl up test may not adequately measure core strength, given that increased body height was associated with higher curl up completion scores...|$|R
25|$|The Scandinavians were {{building}} innovative boats millennia ago, {{as shown by}} the many petroglyph images of Nordic Bronze Age boats. The oldest archaeological find of a wooden Nordic boat is the Hjortspring boat, built about 350 BC. This is the oldest known boat to use clinker planking, where <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> overlap one another. It was designed as a large canoe, 19 m long and crewed by 22–23 men using paddles. Scandinavians continued to develop better boats, incorporating iron and other metal into the design, adding keels, and developing oars for propulsion. Another Nordic shipfind is the Nydam boat, found preserved in the Nydam Mose bog in Sundeved, Denmark. It has been dendro dated to 310-320 AD. Built of oak, it is also clinker-built, is 23 metres long and was rowed by thirty men.|$|E

When observing the sonar signature of Shipwreck D, a long, slender upright feature on the seabed, transformed itself into a wooden mast.

Disappointingly for ship scholars and historians of technology, there are few indications of how <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> of Sinop D are held together. There are no mortise and tenon fastenings, and no sewing. Shipwreck D {{may be one of the}} earliest lateen-rigged ships to be studied by archaeologists. The angle of the mast and the lack of fittings on it suggest that a lateen sail is the most likely configuration for such a small vessel.|$|E
500|$|Built in 3807 or 3806 BC, {{the track}} was a walkway {{consisting}} mainly of planks of oak laid end-to-end, supported by crossed pegs of ash, oak, and lime, {{driven into the}} underlying peat. <b>The</b> <b>planks,</b> which were up to [...] wide, [...] long and less than [...] thick, were cut from trees up to 400years old and [...] in diameter, felled and split using only stone axes, wooden wedges, and mallets. The length, straightness, and lack of forks or branches in the pegs suggest that they were taken from coppiced woodland. Longitudinal log rails up to [...] long and [...] in diameter, made of mostly hazel and alder, were laid down and held in place with the pegs, which were driven at an angle across the rails and into the peat base of the bog. Notches were then cut into <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> to fit the pegs, and <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> were laid along the X shapes to form the walkway. In some places a second rail was placed {{on top of the}} first one to bring the plank above it level {{with the rest of the}} walkway. Some of <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> were then stabilised with slender, vertical wooden pegs driven through holes cut near the end of <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> and into the peat, and sometimes the clay, beneath.
