5|$|Authentic Science Fiction was a British {{science fiction}} {{magazine}} {{published in the}} 1950s that ran for 85 issues under three editors: Gordon Landsborough, H.J. Campbell, and E.C. Tubb. The magazine was published by Hamilton and Co., and began in 1951 {{as a series of}} novels appearing every two weeks; by the summer it became a monthly magazine, with readers' letters and an editorial page, though fiction content was still restricted to a single novel. In 1952 short fiction began to appear alongside the novels, and within <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>years</b> it completed the transformation into a science fiction magazine.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Brooklyn, New York, Zoldak began his {{professional}} career in the low-level minor leagues, working his way up despite being released from his first team. The St. Louis Browns acquired him in 1944 and placed him on their major league roster.

5|$|The Great Western Railway built {{a railway}} line (the Bristol and North Somerset Railway) over {{some parts of}} the canal route from Limpley Stoke to Camerton, where it joined the {{existing}} 1882 branch line from Hallatrow to Camerton.

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939, the GWR returned to direct government control, {{and by the end}} of the war a Labour government was in power and again planning to nationalise the railways. After a couple of years trying to recover from the ravages of war, the GWR became the Western Region of British Railways on 1 January 1948. The Great Western Railway Company continued to exist as a legal entity for nearly <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>years,</b> being formally wound up on 23 December 1949. GWR designs of locomotives and rolling stock continued to be built for a while and the region maintained its own distinctive character, even painting for a while its stations and express trains in a form of chocolate and cream.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{stability}} continually plagued the team. The franchise never {{won more than}} 22 games and {{did not return to}} the playoffs after 1977–78 in its six seasons in Colorado. Prior to the 1978–79 season, the team was sold to New Jersey trucking tycoon Arthur Imperatore, who intended to move the team to his home state. The plan was criticized due to the existence of three other NHL teams in the region, and the proposed New Jersey arena was still under construction; the franchise ultimately stayed in Denver. In 1979, the team hired Don Cherry as head coach and featured forward Lanny McDonald. The Rockies still posted the worst record in the NHL, and Cherry was subsequently fired after the season. After <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>years</b> in Denver, the Rockies were sold to a group headed by John McMullen (who also owned Major League Baseball's Houston Astros) on May 27, 1982, and the franchise moved to New Jersey. As part of the relocation deal, the Devils had to compensate the three existing teams in the region – the New York Islanders, New York Rangers and Flyers – for encroaching on their territory.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{sought the}} {{abolition}} of the elected Poor Law Boards of Guardians, which administered relief and which in some areas were responsible for rates. Many of the Boards were controlled by Labour, and had defied the Government by distributing relief funds to the able-bodied unemployed. Chamberlain's first step in the direction of abolition was the Rating and Valuation Act 1925, which greatly reduced the number of authorities which administered rates, as well as imposing uniform standards for assessment. Despite policy differences Chamberlain continued to work with Churchill, who showed him the manuscript of a volume of his heavily autobiographical The World Crisis. Churchill confided that he would have wished for <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>years</b> to revise the manuscript; Chamberlain wrote to his sisters that he could have done the job in two hours—with a pair of scissors.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} four years, Washington worked {{surveying}} land in Western Virginia and for the Ohio Company, a land investment company funded by Virginia investors. He came to the notice of the new lieutenant governor of Virginia Robert Dinwiddie, thanks to Lawrence's position as commander of the Virginia militia. He was hard to miss; at over six feet, he was taller than most of his contemporaries. In October 1750, Washington resigned his position as an official surveyor, though he continued to work diligently {{over the next three}} years at his new profession. He continued to survey professionally for <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>years,</b> mostly in Frederick County, before receiving a military appointment as adjutant for southern Virginia. By 1752, Washington completed close to 200 surveys on numerous properties totaling more than 60,000 acres. He continued to survey at different times throughout his life and as late as 1799.|$|E
5|$|Haynes {{attended}} {{public schools}} through eighth grade {{and received a}} basic education. He had not determined a career path {{for himself and his}} parents often criticized him for lacking ambition; they insisted that he seek employment. He began by working as a custodian at a local church and later for the railroad, hauling ballast to construction sites. At the church, he joined the choir where he met and began to court Bertha Lanterman. When Portland's first public high school was opened in 1876, Haynes returned to school at age 19 and completed <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>years.</b> Bertha and her family moved to Alabama during the spring of 1877, and Haynes began a regular correspondence with her. During the summer of that year, a series of revival meetings were held in Indiana by Francis Murphy, a leader of a national temperance organization known as the Murphy Movement. Haynes attended the meetings, probably at his parents' urging, and became interested in temperance. He took two of Murphy's pledge cards and carried one for most of his life; the other he mailed to Bertha.|$|E
5|$|In 1948 Robinson fought five times, {{but only}} one bout was a title defense. Among the fighters he {{defeated}} in those non-title bouts was future world champion Kid Gavilán in a close, controversial 10-round fight. Gavilán hurt Robinson {{several times in the}} fight, but Robinson controlled the final rounds with a series of jabs and left hooks. In 1949, he boxed 16 times, but again only defended his title once. In that title fight, a rematch with Gavilán, Robinson again won via decision. The first half of the bout was very close, but Robinson took control in the second half. Gavilán would have to wait <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>years</b> to begin his own historic reign as welterweight champion. The only boxer to match Robinson that year was Henry Brimm, who fought him to a 10-round draw in Buffalo.|$|E

In 1953, Jones's production declined: he had just 401 total yards and no touchdowns, and he decided to retire after the Browns reached and lost another championship game. He went back to Ruston to work at a lumber business he ran in the offseason, but Brown asked him to return in 1954, saying the team needed him. Jones played for <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>years,</b> winning two more championships with the Browns before retiring for good.

5|$|On Why Don't You?, Davies took on varying jobs, {{including}} researcher, director, illustrator, assistant {{floor manager}} and unofficial publicist for fan-mail. He was offered his first professional scriptwriting job in 1986 by show producer Dave Evans; he had entered Evans's office {{to collect his}} wages and was offered an extra £100 to write a replacement script. Davies' script was positively reviewed in the department and led to increasingly larger roles that culminated in a six-month contract to write for the show after it relocated to Manchester in 1988. He worked for the show for <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>years</b> and eventually became the show's producer. He oversaw an increase in drama which tripled its audience—despite the fact BBC Manchester was not permitted by the corporation to create children's dramas—which reached its climax with his last episode: a drama where the Why Don't You? protagonists, led by the show's longest running presenter Ben Slade, were trapped in a café by a supercomputer that tried to kill them.|$|E
