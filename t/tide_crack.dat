40|$|Marine ice accretes at {{the base}} of ice shelves, often {{infilling}} open structural weaknesses and increasing ice-shelf stability. However, the timing and location of marine ice formation remain poorly understood. This study determines marine ice source water composition and origin by examining marine ice crystal morphology, water isotope and solute chemistry in ice samples collected from the southern McMurdo Ice Shelf (SMIS), Antarctica. The measured co-isotopic record together with the output of a freezing model for frazil crystals indicate a spatio-temporally varying water source of sea water and relatively fresher water, such as melted meteoric or marine ice. This is in agreement with the occurrence of primarily banded and granular ice crystal facies typical for frazil ice crystals that nucleate in a supercooled mixture of water masses. We propose that marine ice exposed at the surface of SMIS, which experiences summer melt, is routed to the ice-shelf base via the <b>tide</b> <b>crack.</b> Here frazil crystals nucleate in a double diffusion mechanism of heat and salt between two water masses at their salinity-dependent freezing point. Recycling of previously formed marine ice facilitates ice-shelf selfsustenance in a warming climate. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

Apart from Weddell seals, inhabiting the fast-ice in Atka Bay, {{the other three}} (pack-ice) species however have to date never (Ross and leopard seal) or only very rarely (crabeater seals) been sighted in the Atka Bay region. The aim of the PASATA project is twofold: the large passive acoustic hydrophone array (hereafter referred to as large array) aims to localize calling pack-ice pinniped species to obtain information on their location and hence the ice habitat they occupy. This large array consists of four autonomous passive acoustic recorders with a hydrophone sensor deployed through a drilled hole in the sea ice. The PASATA recordings are time-stamped and can therefore be coupled to the PALAOA recordings so that the hydrophone array spans the bay almost entirely from east to west. The second, smaller hydrophone array (hereafter referred to as small array), also consists of four autonomous passive acoustic recorders with hydrophone sensors deployed through drilled holes in the sea ice. The smaller array was deployed within a Weddell seal breeding colony, located further south in the bay, just off the ice shelf. Male Weddell seals are thought to defend underwater territories around or near <b>tide</b> <b>cracks</b> and breathing holes used by females. Vocal activity increases strongly during the breeding season and vocalizations {{are thought to be}} used underwater by males for the purpose of territorial defense and advertisement. With the smaller hydrophone array we aim to investigate underwater behaviour of vocalizing male and female Weddell seals to provide further information on underwater movement patterns in relation to the location of <b>tide</b> <b>cracks</b> and breathing holes. As a pilot project, one on-ice and three underwater camera systems have been deployed near breathing holes to obtain additional visual information on Weddell seal behavioural activity. Upon each visit in the breeding colony, a census of colony composition on the ice (number of animals, sex, presence of dependent pups, presence and severity of injuries-indicative of competition intensity) as well as GPS readings of breathing holes and positions of hauled out Weddell seals are taken...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} open a coal mine in Ispallen, a {{prospect}} of the company Store Norske, it will necessary to transport the coal across a tidal inlet, Sveasundet, in Svea, Svalbard. In anticipation of this challenge, Store Norske partly funded a PhD position at UNIS to study {{the action of the}} ice on a possible causeway across the inlet and, more generally, to better understand the action of sea ice on coastal structures. I designed and supervised the construction of a 50 -m-long, 8 -m-high and 25 -m-wide breakwater in this microtidal environment— 2. 0 m maximum tidal range—where the seaice period lasts between 4 and 6 months. At the tip of the breakwater I installed a cabin with a weather and ground temperature station and time-lapse cameras. On the seabed I installed a tide and wave gauge. I went on the site on a weekly basis during a full ice season and documented the ice conditions both visually and quantitatively. I used a differential GPS to monitor tidal ice movements, measured ice stresses and took cores to analyse the properties of the coastal ice. To my knowledge, nowhere in the world have ice conditions ever before been documented so thoroughly throughout a whole season. Most engineering literature on sea ice is related to offshore structures. There is so little literature on coastal sea ice that several terms lack a precise definition. In this thesis coastal ice is defined as the ice in the zone that is affected by the boundary conditions at the shore. I identified and documented a variety of coastal-ice processes, most notably the formation, growth and decay of the ice foot, the tidal movement, and the break-up. The observations of the ice foot lead me to revise its definition. At the site of study, the term is essentially relevant during the formation of the sea ice cover and during the breakup. In between, it is more relevant to consider the hinge zone, which is the area where the <b>tide</b> <b>cracks</b> occur. The ice pile-ups that occurred during the break-up perpertrated little damage because that late in the season, the ice was rotten and soft. Since these were the most destructive events, the ice conditions may be characterised as mild. Measurements of the ice strength, elasticity and creep across the coastal zone revealed that the coastal ice was weaker, less stiff and crept less than the free-floating ice. From the shore to the free-floating ice, the measured value of strength ranged monotonously from about 3 to 4 MPa and the measured value of elasticity ranged monotonously from about 1 to 1. 5 GPa. Measuring the stresses in metre-thick ice was challenging but the peak stresses of about 150 kPa is in the range of those found in similar studies (Frederking et al., 1986; Sayed et al., 1988; Moslet, 2001; Nikitin et al., 1992). Surprisingly, the highest stresses were measured in the direction not perpendicular but parallel to the <b>tide</b> <b>cracks.</b> More work is needed to understand the process of stress-build up.

40|$|M. Dunbar (1957) called {{attention}} to the existence of a small circular polynya about 50 m in diameter in Cambridge Fiord in northern Baffin Island for which there was no obvious explanation. Other small polynyas are known in arctic fjords which are usually the result of turbulent mixing in areas of strong currents (Sadler 1974), but Cambridge Fiord is 100 km long, its tidal range is small, and the polynya is situated within 300 m of the delta face {{at the head of the}} fjord so that strong turbulence is very unlikely. The annual reappearance of the polynya in late winter is confirmed by a series of aerial survey photographs taken by the Royal Canadian Air Force between 1952 and 1957 and also by reports from Inuit hunters from Pond Inlet. It is first seen within about two weeks of 15 March appearing in exactly the same position each year as a circle with a diameter of about 40 m. Over a period of about a week, a lead extends from the polynya to the shore and open water is visible in the <b>tide</b> <b>crack</b> for several hundred metres either side of the shore end of the lead. The lead, unlike the polynya, changes its position from year to year, but once formed it remains fixed until general break-up (Figure 1) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{concentrations of}} dimethylsulphide (DMS) and its precursor compound dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), and chlorophyll a {{in a variety}} of sea ice and seawater habitats from pack and fast ice in the Antarctic Sea Ice Zone (ASIZ) of the Prydz Bay-Davis-Casey region of eastern Antarctica during spring and summer. These results were used to calculate the DMS flux from ice-free ocean water and melting sea ice in this region. Estimated seawater DMS concentrations derived from sea ice DMSPt released during ice melting showed that in October, sea ice derived DMS of the order of 20 - 50 nM is associated with DMSPt released from melting sea ice of 0. 4 m thickness. In November and December, melting of large areas of ice less than 0. 6 m thick could release larger amounts of DMS around 50 - 80 nM and 150 - 270 nM, respectively. In addition, DMSPt released from 1. 0 - 1. 2 m thick ice in December could result in 2 ̆ 2 hot spot 2 ̆ 2 concentrations of DMS of around 100 nM. DMS fluxes measured mainly in the Prydz Bay-Davis region in November and mid to late December were highest in pack ice 3 ̆e fast ice 3 ̆e ice edge (pack ice = 54 μmol m- 2 d- 1; range 1 - 325); fast ice = 28 μmol m- 2 d- 1; range 0 - 168); ice edge = 12 and 23 μmol m- 2 d- 1; range 1. 2 - 26). In ice-free seawater in the Davis area from January to February, although dissolved DMS concentrations were low, DMS fluxes were high due to high wind speeds (DMS = 3 nM; DMS flux = 27 μmol m- 2 d- 1 umol; range 1 - 101). DMS concentrations and flux from a fast ice <b>tide</b> <b>crack</b> (DMS = 12 nM; DMS flux 6 - 81 μmol m- 2 d- 1), and from the Davis region 2 days following fast ice breakout (DMS 12 nM; DMS flux 45 - 84 μmol m- 2 d- 1) were also a significant source of DMS to the atmosphere of this region. In contrast DMS and DMS flux from a fast ice melt-pool was low (DMS = 1 nM; DMS flux 0. 5 - 7 μmol m- 2 d- 1). These measurements support the suggestion that during sea ice melting during late spring to early summer (November - December), the ASIZ is an area of high DMS (P) production, leading to very high fluxes of DMS to the atmosphere of this region. What effect this huge pulse of atmospheric DMS has on the radiative climate of this region is unknown...|$|E
50|$|This species lives {{lower on}} rocks than does L. planaxis, and migrates {{up and down}} rocks with the tide. It crawls out of tidepools at night. Often, it hides at low <b>tide</b> in <b>cracks</b> or {{barnacle}} shells. The waves {{on both sides of}} the foot are out of phase with one another (ditaxic). It feeds mainly on diatom films, microscopic algae, lichens, etc., and will also feed on Pelvetia, Ulva, and other larger algae. L. scutulata breeds in all seasons except summer. Eggs are laid underwater, individually packaged in flattened capsules within a sausage-shaped gelatinous mass coiled in a spiral and holding over 2000 eggs. Its eye anatomy is similar to that of the land snail Helix aspera. In Oregon, over 10% of individuals harbor parasitic flukes.Leptasterias hexactis feeds on this snail.

40|$|The Southern Ocean {{and more}} {{specifically}} the sea-ice zone supports globally significant ecosystems including abundant populations of marine mammals and seabirds. In the marine environment, resources are heterogeneously distributed and structured in patches driven by physical features of the environment at different spatio-temporal scales. Among the activities included in the habitat use concept, foraging {{is one of the}} most important because obtaining adequate food supply is a basic requirement of all other life-history traits. The optimal foraging theory predicts that predators should adjust their movements and behaviour in relation to prey density (in both horizontal and vertical dimensions in the case of marine predators). Thus, studying the movement patterns and diving behaviour of top predators in relation with biotic and abiotic environmental features can provide valuable insights in the behavioural tactics they have evolved and/or learned to maximize prey acquisition in a given environment. This is even more relevant in polar regions where animals face particularly harsh conditions (e. g. darkness and associated reduced productivity for most of the year, sea-ice cover, cold water and air, strong winds). The Weddell seal is the only marine mammal inhabiting the coastal fast-ice area year-round. While its behaviour has been well studied in summer when individuals are breeding or moulting on the sea-ice, virtually nothing is known about their winter ecology. However, winter is a crucial period in Weddell seals life cycle during which they spend 80 % of their time diving under the ice to store the energy needed for the following breeding season. Using telemetric data, the main aim of this thesis was to improve our understanding of the foraging strategies adopted by Weddell seals during winter in two locations of East Antarctica (Dumont D’Urville and Davis). First, we developed two methods to identify and quantify within dive foraging effort from both high and low-resolution dive datasets. Then, these foraging metrics were used to investigate the influence of several key abiotic parameters of the Antarctic environment on Weddell seals’ foraging behaviour. Although Weddell seals from Davis travelled more during winter, overall Weddell seals from both locations essentially remained and foraged in areas close to the coast associated with highly concentrated ice. Our results showed sea-ice concentration did not influence Weddell seals’ behaviour. However, the pluri-annual residency of focal seals to similar areas suggested they relied on smaller features within the fast-ice, such as perennial <b>tide</b> <b>cracks</b> close to land. At both locations, seals increased their foraging effort during winter likely responding to the approach of the pup birth (individuals were mainly females). The seals foraged essentially in shallow waters in areas where the topography is likely inducing upwelling of the nutrient enriched water masses, such as the modified circumpolar deep water in which Weddell seals from DDU increased their foraging effort throughout winter. At both locations, Weddell seals exhibited complex diving behaviour and used both pelagic and benthic strategies, reflecting the opportunistic nature of their feeding. They also adapted their diving behaviour to light intensity suggesting they follow the vertical migration of their prey, such as P. antarcticum. Overall, Weddell seals seemed to optimize their foraging strategies during winter by adapting their foraging behaviour in response to physical parameters of their environment (e. g. features in the fast-ice, topography and hydrology) that are likely to be associated with better prey availability and accessibility, as well as regular access to breathing sites. At finer scale the foraging behaviour of Weddell seals appear to respond to the distribution and availability of prey in the water column (i. e. switching from pelagic to benthic foraging, exhibiting diurnal behaviour, and the complexity of the dives). Our study revealed some key foraging strategies adopted by the Weddell seals demonstrating that they actively optimize their spatial use of the fast-ice environment in both the temporal, horizontal and vertical dimensions during winter...|$|R
