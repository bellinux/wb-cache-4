5|$|Girdap's heyday {{was during}} <b>the</b> <b>Balkan</b> Wars and World War I (1912–1918), {{when it became}} the leading {{financial}} group in the kingdom and remained close to the government. It controlled some 83.97 million leva of invested capital, which put it ahead of the General Credit Society, <b>the</b> <b>Balkan</b> Bank and the Bulgarian Commercial Bank financial group. During the wars, Bulgarian banks established filial companies or invested in new enterprises. Girdap was no exception to that trend.|$|E

5|$|The crested newts are {{believed}} to have originated in the Balkans and radiated in a brief time interval between 11.5 and 8 mya: First, the Balkan–Asian group (the Anatolian, Balkan and southern crested newt) branched off from the other crested newts, probably in a vicariance event caused by the separation of <b>the</b> <b>Balkan</b> and Anatolian land masses. The origin of current-day species is not fully understood so far, but one hypothesis suggests that ecological differences, notably in the adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle, may have evolved between populations and led to parapatric speciation. Alternatively, the complex geological history of <b>the</b> <b>Balkan</b> peninsula may have further separated populations there, with subsequent allopatric speciation and the spread of species into their current ranges.|$|E
5|$|The earlier {{inhabitants}} of <b>the</b> <b>Balkan</b> Peninsula were an agricultural people who, using Animism, assigned a spirit to {{every aspect of}} nature. Eventually, these vague spirits assumed human forms and entered the local mythology as gods.

Other older gods of the agricultural world fused {{with those of the}} more powerful invaders or else faded into insignificance.|$|E

5|$|The Romanians' ethnogenesis {{cannot be}} {{understood}} based exclusively on written sources, because the earliest records on their ancestors {{were made by}} 11th-century Byzantine historians.
