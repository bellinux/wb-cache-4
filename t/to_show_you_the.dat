According to Lovato, different video treatments had been written, but she rejected them as she wanted {{to come up with}} the idea herself. She said, [...] "They had treatments , but I was just like, 'No, scratch them.' I want {{to come up with the}} idea. I want <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> colors, I want to show you everything. This is art to me and I don't want it to be somebody else's decision." [...] In an interview with PopEater, Lovato said of the video: ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2016 Brit Awards, Lorde gave a {{performance}} of [...] "Life on Mars" [...] in tribute to the late English singer David Bowie. According to Billboard, Lorde said she'd be writing new material in December 2013. While responding to a fan on her Instagram account in August 2016, {{she said that the}} record is written and they're in production stages now. In November, she posted a note on her Facebook account stating: [...] "Writing Pure Heroine was my way of enshrining our teenage glory, putting it up in lights forever so that part of me never dies, and this record— well, this one is about what comes next. ...The party is about to start. I am about <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> new world." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2008, Daniel Handler {{said that}} [...] "a sequel {{does seem to}} be in the works. Paramount has had quite a few {{corporate}} shakeups, which has led to many a delay. Of course, many, many plans in Hollywood come to naught, but I'm assured that another film will be made. Someday. Perhaps." [...] In June 2009, Silberling confirmed he still talked about the project with Handler, and suggested the sequel be a stop motion film because the lead actors have grown too old. [...] "In an odd way, the best thing you could do is actually have Lemony Snicket say to the audience, 'Okay, we pawned the first film off as a mere dramatization with actors. Now, I'm afraid I’m going to have <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> real thing.'" ...|$|E

[...] "I have seen grander sights {{and there are}} more picturesque cities than Montreal--I'm looking forward <b>to</b> <b>showing</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> work of the Moguls in India--but happiness such as I've had of late casts a glamour over everything. It wasn't always so with me; I've had my bad hours when I was blind to beauty." ...|$|R
500|$|The Dreamcast {{version was}} heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{best bet for}} all {{involved}} would be to take your chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that [...] "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint {{the most basic of}} cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but what else is there to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that [...] "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". He also complained that [...] "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already read your hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to waste your time". Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera always goes {{to the bottom of the}} machine <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each time you do something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".|$|E

2500|$|Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker {{considered}} Buscemi miscast as {{the central}} figure in the drama. [...] "Buscemi can’t play that kind of character; even {{at the age of}} fifty-two, he looks cagey and restless—not like a guy at the top but like the guy who gets killed when he tries to knock off the guy at the top." [...] The review concludes [...] "Boardwalk Empire” is at great pains to give viewers a sense that they are there, and yet rarely did I feel engrossed in the show. Even if its point is <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> ugly side of fun, Boardwalk Empire should be much more fun to watch." ...|$|E
