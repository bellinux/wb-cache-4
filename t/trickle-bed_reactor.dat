40|$|A new {{development}} {{in the field of}} internals in packed columns is the use of structured packing types. Recently, a new structured packing type coated with a thin alumina layer (KATAPAK(TM)) has been developed. In this report, the results of an experimental and theoretical study concerning the possible applicability of this new packing material for hydrogenation processes in a <b>trickle-bed</b> <b>reactor</b> is presented. The palladium catalyzed hydrogenation of alpha-methylstyrene is used as a model reaction to study hydrodynamics and mass transfer characteristics in a <b>trickle-bed</b> <b>reactor</b> under reactive conditions. Conversions at several process conditions are measured in a pilot plant in which 3 mm spheres as well KATAPAK(TM) is applied as packing materials. A comparison of the results of some physical absorption experiments with the results of hydrogenation experiments showed that the resistances in series model-in which the total resistance against mass transfer is calculated from the separate resistances-is not valid in systems where heterogeneous reactions at the solid surface can enhance the mass transfer-rate at the gas-liquid interphase. With the aid of a developed <b>trickle-bed</b> <b>reactor</b> model, based on liquid diffusion, simultaneous reaction at the solid surface and zero volume mixing points,the mass transfer phenomena in trickle-bed reactors in conditions where the resistances in series model fails can be explained and described. The numerically solved model calculates the hydrogen profiles in the liquid films of the reactor and over all single pass conversions at several process conditions. These conclusions are confirmed by the results of the simulation of a model reactor, i. e. the laminar film reactor with a catalytically active wall. From the results of the measurements it could be concluded that in trickle-flow conditions, the application of KATAPAK(TM) does not significantly improve on the overall performance of trickle-bed reactors. The increase of the physical absorption rate due to better mass transfer characteristics of structured packings compared to dumped packing types-as reported in literature-will be eliminated to a certain extent in reactive systems due to the enhancement effect of heterogeneous reactions in trickle-flow operation.

40|$|Three {{different}} gas–liquid–solid reactor configurations {{have been}} used to investigate the performance of a P-doped NiMo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst in the hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene. The commonly used millipacked bed reactor with 250 – 500 μm catalyst particles diluted with 125 μm inert particles, a micropacked bed reactor with 55 – 90 μm catalyst particles, and a slurry reactor with 150 – 250 μm catalyst particles were used in the catalyst performance testing program. It appeared that the inherently small particle size in the packed beds causes the hydrodynamics to be dramatically different compared to the industrially applied <b>trickle-bed</b> <b>reactors.</b> For particles smaller than typically 2 mm the capillary forces predominate over the viscous and gravitational forces, in sharp contrast to large-scale industrial reactors. Since the gas flow follows preferential pathways through beds consisting of small particles, the poor radial dispersion of the gaseous components can cause mass-transport limitations, even for a rather slow reaction such as the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of dibenzothiophene, {{as a result of the}} strong inhibition by the reaction product H 2 S.

40|$|Process {{equipment}} {{models are}} needed in all stages of chemical process research and design. Typically, process equipment models consist of systems of partial differential equations for mass and energy balances and complicated closure models for mass transfer, chemical kinetics, and physical properties. The scope of this work is further development of the moment method for modeling applications {{that are based on}} the one-dimensional axial dispersion model. This versatile model can be used for most process equipment, such as chemical reactors, adsorbers and chromatographic columns, and distillation and absorption columns. The moment method is a numerical technique for partial differential equations from the class of weighted residual methods (WRM). In this work it is shown with examples how the moment method can be applied to process equipment modeling. The examples are: catalyst activity profiles in fixed-bed reactors, dynamic modeling of chemical reactors and fixed-bed adsorbers with axial dispersion, and steady-state and dynamic modeling and simulation of continuous contact separation processes with or without axial dispersion. An innovative field of application of the moment method is continuous-contact separation processes. The advantage of the moment method, compared to the state-of-the-art nonequilibrium stage model, is that the same level of numerical accuracy can be achieved with fewer variables. In addition, the degree of axial dispersion can be controlled precisely since only physical axial dispersion is introduced via the axial dispersion coefficient. When using axial dispersion models, special attention has to be paid to the boundary conditions. Using the moment transformation it is shown that the Danckwerts boundary conditions are appropriate for time-dependent models in closed-closed geometries. An advantage of the moment method, compared to other weighted residual methods such as orthogonal collocation on finite elements, is the ease with which boundary conditions are specified. The boundary conditions do not arise as additional algebraic equations. Instead, they simply appear as additive source terms in the moment transformed model equations. The second part of this thesis deals with the detailed closure models that are needed for process modeling. Relevance of some of the closure models is scrutinized in particular with two test cases. The first test case is gas-liquid mass transfer coefficients in <b>trickle-bed</b> <b>reactors.</b> It is shown that the correlation of Goto and Smith is appropriate for gas-liquid mass transfer coefficients in industrial <b>trickle-bed</b> <b>reactors.</b> The second test case is vapor-liquid equilibrium model parameters for binary systems of trans- 2 -butene and cis- 2 -butene and five alcohols.

40|$|Heterogeneous {{catalysis}} {{based upon}} multiphase reactions {{is a very}} important issue in the chemical industry. Various mass transfer resistances (gas-liquid, liquid-solid, pore diffusion) occur in such systems. This results {{in the fact that the}} effective rate of reaction is much lower than the reaction rate of the chemical reaction itself. Furthermore the intrinsic kinetic is very difficult to determine experimentally. The present work focuses on the determination of intrinsic kinetic and the derivation of a formal kinetic approach. For this purpose the hydrogenation of 1 -octene to n-octane on a commercially Ni-catalyst in a vibrating batch reactor was chosen as the model system. In such a system each mass transfer resistance can be defined stepwise and excluded by the systematical variation of the reaction condition (concentration of catalyst and octene, particle size). The effective rate of reaction is strongly limited by the liquid-solid mass transfer at high concentrations of octene and catalyst. In addition the increase of the particle size of the catalyst leads to decrease of the reaction rate due to the liquid-solid mass transfer and the pore diffusion. In order to determinate the intrinsic kinetic, the concentration of hydrogen and the temperature were varied besides of the variation of the octene concentration. The results show that the rate of chemical reaction is zero order with respect to concentration of hydrogen under higher pressure (up to 5 bar). Another aim of this work is the optimization of existing methods for multiphase reactions using the so called pre-saturation technology. The basic idea of this concept is that only the pre-saturated liquid phase is in contact with the catalyst. Hence there are only one (liquid) fluid phase and the solid catalyst within the reactor. Thus the gas-liquid mass transfer resistance is excluded. So the mathematical treatment of the fluid dynamic influence is less complex and a scale-up is easier. The concept offers further advantages compared to the classical three phase technology. Results from experiments performed in the classical <b>trickle-bed</b> <b>reactor</b> are used for a comparison. The data indicate that the effective rate of reaction in the <b>trickle-bed</b> <b>reactor</b> is 20 times lower than the intrinsic rate of the chemical reaction. For the same particle size the effective rate of reaction is higher in the two phase reactor with pre-saturator than in the <b>trickle-bed</b> <b>reactor.</b> In a <b>trickle-bed</b> <b>reactor</b> the rate of reaction is limited by gas-liquid mass transfer. The data of reaction kinetics from continuously operated fixed-bed reactor correspond with the result of a discontinuously vibrating reactor. In addition to kinetic and reaction engineering investigations, considerations and calculations are carried out based on the experimental data in a technical fixed bed reactor.

The hydrodynamic parameters were determined from residence time distribution measurements, using an imperfect pulse method for time-domain analysis of nonideal pulse tracer response. A transient diffusion model of the tracer in the porous particle coupled with the piston-dispersion-exchange model was used to interpret the residence time distribution curves obtained. Gas-liquid mass transfer parameters were determined by a stationary method based on the least-squares fit of the calculated concentration profiles in gas phase to the experimental values. Analysis of steady-state performances showed that under like operating conditions, the TBR outperforms the PBC in terms of conversions. A pulse change in the inlet methanol or NH 4 +-nitrogen concentration causes a negligible transient change in the outlet methanol concentration and a negligible or high transient change in the outlet NH 4 +-nitrogen concentration. A step change in the inlet methanol concentration causes the negligible transient change in the methanol outlet concentration and a relatively important transient change in the NH 4 +-nitrogen outlet concentration. A step increase in the NH 4 +-nitrogen inlet concentration induces a drastic transient change in the NH 4 +-nitrogen outlet concentration but a negligible transient change in the methanol outlet concentration...|$|R

The present model is compared to the capillary pressure models of Grosser et al. (AIChE J., 34 : 1850 - 1860, 1988) and Attou and Ferschneider (Chem. Eng. Sci., 55 : 491 - 511, 2000) and to the experiments of Dodds and Srivastava (Part Part Syst. Charact., 23 : 29 - 39, 2006) and Dullien et al. (J. Colloid Interface Sci., 127 : 362 - 372, 1989). The non-homogeneity of real packings is considered through particle size and porosity distributions. The model {{is based on the}} assumption that the particles are covered with a liquid film, which provides hydrodynamic continuity. This makes the model more suitable for porous or rough particles than for non-porous smooth particles. The main improvements of the present model are found in the pendular region, where the liquid dispersion due to capillary pressure gradients is most significant. The model can be used to improve the hydrodynamic models (e. g., CFD and cellular automata models) for packed-bed <b>reactors,</b> such as <b>trickle-bed</b> <b>reactors,</b> where gas, liquid, and solid phases are present. Models for such reactors have become quite common lately (Saez and Carbonell, AIChE J., 31 : 52 - 62, 1985; Holub et al., Chem. Eng. Sci, 47, 2343 - 2348, 1992; Attou et al., Chem. Eng. Sci., 54 : 785 - 802, 1999; Iliuta and Larachi, Chem. Eng. Sci., 54 : 5039 - 5045, 1999, IJCRE 3 :R 4, 2005; Narasimhan et al., AIChE J., 48 : 2459 - 2474, 2002), but they still lack proper terms causing liquid dispersion...|$|R
40|$|The use of monoliths in {{chemical}} processes {{has been studied}} {{with the emphasis on}} liquid-phase hydrogenations. A monolithic catalyst consists of many narrow, parallel channels with catalytically active species either incorporated into the wall itself or into a layer of a porous oxide deposited on the wall (a washcoat). The hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT), which was taken as a model for sulphur containing molecules in heavy petroleum fractions, was studied on a CoMoS catalyst supported on a. gamma. -Al 2 O 3 monolith at 6 - 8 MPa and 543 - 573 K. The experimental data were found to be consistent with a Langmuir-Hinshelwood type of rate model assuming two different active sites. In another set of experiments, the selective catalytic hydrogenation of acetylene {{in the presence of a}} liquid solvent was studied. Industrially a gas phase process with a Pd/. alfa. -Al 2 O 3 catalyst is used. The introduction of a liquid solvent serves the dual purpose of continuously removing both heat and green oil. Green oil is a catalyst fouling byproduct formed by hydropolymerization of acetylene. Mathematical models describing monolith reactors were developed and used to evaluate different designs of monolith reactors. To better account for the non-uniform distribution of active material, typical of washcoated monoliths, a method for estimating effectiveness factors was developed. Computer simulations were then used to make comparative studies of monolith and conventional <b>trickle-bed</b> <b>reactors.</b> The liquid-phase methanol synthesis was taken as a case study. A more general comparison was also carried out, indicating that a monolith can be advantageous for relatively fast reactions, especially when high pressure drops must be avoided. The cocurrent flow of gas and liquid in a vertical channel has been analyzed on a more detailed level by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A moving boundary formulation of the Finite Element Method (FEM) was used to analyze the deformation of large gas bubbles. The influence of gravitational, capillary, viscosity and inertial forces on the bubble shape and the thickness of the liquid film surrounding the gas bubble were analyzed. In addition, it was shown that it is possible to form a stable, toroidal gas bubble if the liquid viscosity is very high; this unusual flow pattern is termed stalactite flow...|$|R
40|$|Microbial biofilms {{have been}} {{proposed}} as robust, self-immobilized and self-regenerating catalysts. As a model study, this thesis provides an example for the design and operation of a catalytic biofilm process {{for the production of}} chemicals. The capacity to form single-species biofilms was evaluated for 68 strains of microorganisms to estimate the scope of biofilms for catalytic application. By changing substratum characteristics, inoculum density and nutrient availability, 66 strains (97 %) demonstrated biofilm formation and 36 strains (53 %) were classified as strong biofilm formers. The abundance of biofilm forming microbes demonstrates a broad potential for biofilm application in chemical production processes. With the aim to develop a biofilm process for ethylene glycol biotransformation, 62 bacterial and yeast strains were screened for ethylene glycol conversion. Pseudomonas putida JM 37 displayed the highest substrate conversion rate and was selected as a potential catalyst for the production of glyoxylic acid. Based on published metabolic pathways for P. putida, tartronate semialdehyde synthase (gcl), malate synthase (glcB) and isocitrate lyase (aceA) were identified as targets for gene disruption to block the further conversion of glyoxylic acid. Single and double knockout mutants of gcl, glcB and aceA were generated by transposon and site-directed mutagenesis. Glyoxylic acid conversion was not affected by these mutations, which indicates that gcl, glcB and aceA are not essential for glyoxylic acid metabolism in P. putida JM 37. As a biofilm former with good glycolic acid productivity, Pseudomonas diminuta was chosen for the evaluation of a <b>trickle-bed</b> biofilm <b>reactor</b> with structured packing. Structured packing is efficient for gas-liquid exchange in chemical catalysis. The current study is the first to employ structured packing as biofilm substratum, and an aerated continuous biofilm reactor system was designed. P. diminuta established an active biofilm and catalyzed the oxidation of ethylene glycol to glycolic acid for over two months. A steady-state productivity of up to 1. 6 gl- 1 h- 1 was achieved, with excellent process robustness and reproducibility. The results demonstrate the potential of structured packing as biofilm substratum for the production of chemicals. Implementation is recommended for whole-cell processes which require improved catalyst stability, catalyst retention for continuous operation, or efficient gas-liquid exchange...|$|R
