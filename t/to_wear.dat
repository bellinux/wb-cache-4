5|$|Clan chiefs may {{wear their}} crest simpliciter, that is without being encircled by the motto {{and without any}} feathers. It is more common, however, for a clan chiefs <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> their own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their motto or slogan (pictured left). The chief's crest badge does not contain the strap and buckle that other clan members are permitted <b>to</b> <b>wear.</b> Clan chiefs are also entitled <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> three eagle feathers behind the circlet of their crest badge. On certain occasions, such as clan gatherings, it may be appropriate to use real eagle feathers. Clan chiefs that {{are members of the}} British Peerage or a feudal baron are entitled <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge, though {{this is a matter of}} personal preference.|$|E

5|$|April 15, 2007, was the 60th {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut, with ceremonies held at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California.

5|$|As an {{exception}} to the retired-number policy, MLB began honoring Robinson by allowing players <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> number 42 on April 15, Jackie Robinson Day, which is an annual observance that started in 2004. For the 60th anniversary of Robinson's major league debut, MLB invited players <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> the number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day in 2007. The gesture was originally the idea of outfielder Ken Griffey, Jr., who sought Rachel Robinson's permission <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> the number. After receiving her permission, Commissioner Bud Selig not only allowed Griffey <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> the number, but also extended an invitation to all major league teams to do the same. Ultimately, more than 200 players wore number 42, including the entire rosters of the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, and Pittsburgh Pirates. The tribute was continued in 2008, when, during games on April 15, all members of the Mets, Cardinals, Washington Nationals, and Tampa Bay Rays wore Robinson's number 42. On June 25, 2008, MLB installed a new plaque for Robinson at the Baseball Hall of Fame commemorating his off-the-field impact on the game as well as his playing statistics. In 2009, all uniformed personnel (players, managers, coaches, and umpires) wore number 42 on April 15.|$|E
5|$|As both Manchester United and Bayern Munich {{traditionally}} wore red {{as their}} primary kit colour, UEFA regulations would normally have required both teams <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> their change kits. However, the two clubs felt {{it would have been}} a shame for neither <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> their traditional colours, and they agreed to toss a coin to see who would have first choice. Manchester United won the toss and therefore wore their usual European colours of red shirts, white shorts and white socks, while Bayern wore silver shirts, shorts and socks, all with maroon trim.|$|E

The Nazi costumes were genuine and were found in Eastern Europe by Powell's co-designer Joanna Johnston, to whom he gave research pictures and drawings for reference.|$|E
