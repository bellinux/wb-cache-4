To reduce one of the constraints to the productivity of Djallonké sheep, high mortality during suckling in full rainy and start dry season, we tested hygienic measures and medication in improved housing. The effect of the two treatments and their combination on lamb performance and the {{internal rate of return}} (IRR) were compared to a control. For each treatment, survival and growth were observed in 20 lambs, living in 38 herds. Good housing and hygiene (daily cleaning and fortnightly disinfection of stable and water and feed troughs) reduced mortality and increased growth of suckling lambs until 3 months.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a supervisor system for monitoring {{the operation of}} automated agricultural vehicles. The system analyses {{all of the information}} provided by the sensors and subsystems on the vehicles in real time and notifies the user when a failure or potentially dangerous situation is detected. In some situations, it is even able to execute a neutralising protocol to remedy the failure. The system is based on a distributed and multi-level architecture that divides the supervision into different subsystems, allowing for better management of the detection and repair of failures. The proposed supervision system was developed to perform well in several scenarios, such as spraying canopy treatments against insects and diseases and selective weed <b>treatments,</b> <b>by</b> either <b>spraying</b> herbicide or burning pests with a mechanical-thermal actuator. Results are presented for selective weed <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> the <b>spraying</b> of herbicide. The system successfully supervised the task; it detected failures such as service disruptions, incorrect working speeds, incorrect implement states, and potential collisions. Moreover, the system was able to prevent collisions between vehicles by taking action to avoid intersecting trajectories. The results show that the proposed system is a highly useful tool for managing fleets of autonomous vehicles. In particular, {{it can be used to}} manage agricultural vehicles during treatment operations...|$|R

In contrast, techniques for treating package bees with OA {{have not been}} investigated. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop a protocol for using OA to reduce mite infestation in package bees. We made 97 mini packages of Varroa-infested adult bees. Each package contained 1, 613 ± 18 bees and 92 ± 3 mites, and represented an experimental unit. We prepared a 2. 8 % solution of OA by mixing 35 g OA with 1 l of sugar water (sugar:water = 1 : 1; w:w). Eight treatments were assigned to the packages based on previous laboratory bioassays that characterized the acute contact toxicity of OA to mites and bees. We administered the <b>treatments</b> <b>by</b> <b>spraying</b> the OA solution directly on the bees through the mesh screen cage using a pressurized air brush and quantified mite and bee mortality over a 10 -day period.

In {{the pesticide}} registration procedure, the honey bee {{represents one of}} the non-target model species for which the risk posed by pesticides must be assessed {{on the basis of the}} hazard quotient (HQ). The HQ is defined as the ratio between environmental exposure and toxicity.

Several research groups who performed functional screens for broad-spectrum antivirals identified compounds targeting the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. Despite their strong antiviral activity in vitro, whether such antimetabolites are effective in vivo remains highly controversial. Here, we evaluated two potent pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors developed in our laboratory, IPPA 17 -A 04 and GAC 50, in a model of mild hRSV-infection in cynomolgus macaques.

The EE/CA study was performed for the Commodity Credit Corporation of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (CCC/USDA), as the technical {{basis for a}} proposed removal action for the Murdock site. The EE/CA was conducted in compliance with an Administrative Order on Consent issued for Murdock by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA 1991). Three removal action alternatives were examined {{through the use of}} site-specific data and predictive simulations of groundwater flow and contaminant transport performed with calibrated numerical models. The alternatives were evaluated individually and compared against performance criteria established under the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). On the basis of these evaluations, an alternative employing phytoremediation in conjunction with seasonal groundwater extraction and <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> irrigation was recommended by the CCC/USDA to permanently reduce the carbon tetrachloride contaminant levels in groundwater and surface water at the site. The proposed alternative is being implemented in cooperation with the EPA. Under the direction of the CCC/USDA and the EPA, implementation of the chosen removal action occurred in phases, beginning in April 2005. Installation of all the required remediation systems was completed by the end of August 2005. Specific technical objectives of the removal action are as follows: (1) To eliminate pathways for potential human exposure to carbon tetrachloride concentrations above the regulatory limit of 44. 2 {micro}g/L in surface water at the site. (2) To minimize or eliminate any detrimental environmental impacts of carbon tetrachloride discharge to the surface waters of a tributary creek located immediately north of the town. (3) To permanently reduce carbon tetrachloride concentrations in the groundwater and surface water at Murdock and hence restore these resources for potential beneficial use. To evaluate the effectiveness of the selected remedy and its ability to achieve the objectives specified for this site, monitoring is required. This document outlines the proposed scope of a long-term program for monitoring of the removal action at Murdock. In this section the specific remedial objectives of the action are summarized, and a brief overview of the chosen remedy is provided. Section 2 summarizes the results of a baseline sampling event that documented the distribution of carbon tetrachloride contamination in selected media at the Murdock site immediately before cleanup activities began.

The Ag-NiO composite powders were made of the Ag layer in the internal region and the Ag-NiO composite layer in the external region from the result of the EPMA analysis. The structure of the obtained powders was different from the internal structure of the composite powders prepared <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis from the metal nitrate solution. The new powder production process where the separation with solvent extraction was carried out, followed <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis, was proposed. In this process the composite powders were prepared <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis from the organic phase loading and refining the targeted elements from the impure raw materials like wastes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEfficient {{inverted}} polymer {{solar cells}} (PSCs) were fabricated with ZnO electron transport layers (ETLs) prepared <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis, {{which is a}} simple and cost efficient method producing a thin oxide layer <b>by</b> direct <b>spray</b> of precursor on hot substrate. To investigate the effect of substrate temperature on the structural and optical properties as well as performance of PSCs, ZnO ETLs were fabricated <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis on hot substrate controlled at 150, 250, and 350 °C, respectively. The PSC with ZnO prepared <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis at 150 °C exhibited poor power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0. 94 % due to the mis-matched energy level and microscopic roughness of ZnO ETL. On the other hand, enhanced efficiency of 2. 99 % and 3. 22 % was obtained by using ZnO prepared <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis at 250 and 350 °C, respectively. Enhancement of efficiency at higher temperature is attributed to better matching of ZnO coated ITO work-function with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of PCBM {{and the formation of}} smooth and homogeneous polycrystalline ZnO, resulting in improved interfacial property and electron transport. In the durability test, inverted ZnO solar cell was retained above 80 % during 9 days in an ambient atmosphere without any encapsulation, while conventional solar cells showed dramatic decrease of efficiency...|$|R
