As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended. Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.|$|E

5|$|During the withdraw, however, A Company {{ran into}} a sizable North Korean force and had {{scattered}} in the ensuing fight. Most of the company, including its commander were killed at close range. In this desperate action, Private First Class Luther H. Story, a weapons squad leader, fought so tenaciously that {{he was awarded the}} Medal of Honor. Badly wounded, Story refused to be a burden to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> escape, and when last seen was still engaging North Korean at close range. Of those in the company, approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines. The next morning, under heavy fog, the group made its way by compass toward Yongsan. From a hill at 12:00, after the fog had lifted, the men looked down on the Battle of Yongsan which was then in progress. That afternoon 20 survivors of the company merged into the lines of the 72nd Tank Battalion near Yongsan. Stragglers from this position continued to stream {{in the next few days}} as well.|$|E
5|$|With {{the public}} {{suspicious}} of immigrants, especially <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> be socialists or communists, Congress passed the Per Centum Act of 1921, signed by Harding on May 19, 1921, {{as a quick}} means of restricting immigration. The act reduced the numbers of immigrants to 3% of those from a given country living in the U.S., based on the 1910 census. This would, in practice, not restrict immigration from Ireland and Germany, but would bar many Italians and eastern European Jews. Harding and Secretary of Labor James Davis believed that enforcement had to be humane, and at the secretary's recommendation, Harding allowed almost a thousand deportable immigrants to remain. Coolidge signed a bill permanently restricting immigration to the U.S. in 1924.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern era}} of AAC {{began in the}} 1950s in Europe and North America, spurred by several {{societal}} changes; these included an increased awareness of individuals with communication and other disabilities, and a growing commitment, often backed by government legislation and funding, to develop their education, independence and rights. In the early years, AAC was primarily used with laryngectomy and glossectomy cases, and later with individuals with cerebral palsy and aphasia. It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech intervention to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> {{be able to learn}} to speak. Individuals with intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because it was believed that they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC. The main systems used were manual signs, communication boards and Morse code, though in the early 1960s, an electric communication device {{in the form of a}} sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Tillman believed, {{and often}} stated as senator, that blacks must submit to either white {{domination}} or extermination. He {{was reluctant to}} undertake the latter, fearing hundreds of whites would die accomplishing it. He campaigned in the violent 1898 North Carolina elections, in which white Democrats were determined to take back control from a biracial Populist-Republican coalition elected in 1894 and 1896 on a fusion ticket. He spoke widely in North Carolina {{in the fall of}} 1898, often to crowds wearing red shirts, disheartening his Populist supporters. Terror and intimidation again won the day for the Democrats, who were elected statewide. They failed to win in the coastal city of Wilmington, but white supremacists took over by force. South Carolina saw violence as well: an effort to register black voters in Phoenix led whites to provoke a confrontation, after which a number of African Americans were murdered. Tillman warned African Americans and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> combine with them that black political activism would provoke a murderous response from whites.|$|E

40|$|Most {{patients}} with idiopathic membranous nephropathy have a benign course, but a minority develop severe persistent nephrotic syndrome or endstage renal failure.

For this reason {{it would be useful}} to identify at an early stage <b>those</b> patients <b>who</b> <b>might</b> benefit from treatment. This information could be used to minimize the exposure of patients to unnecessary treatment toxicity. We studied a cohort of 128 patients over a 2 -year period. A clear relationship exists between the early response to treatment at one month and the long-term outcome from treatment across a number of treatment types. <b>Those</b> patients <b>who</b> <b>might</b> benefit from treatment and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> are unlikely to benefit, can be clearly distinguished at an early stage...|$|R

He was the first governor from New Castle County in thirty years, and was regarded as a progressive governor, advocating improvements to the school law, and reapportionment of the General Assembly, to more fairly reflect the population of New Castle County. The reapportionment proposal was not approved. The General Assembly did, however, pass legislation requiring businesses serving the public “to provide equal accommodations for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> be deemed obnoxious by others.” This effort to deny civil rights to African-Americans was to remain on the books until 1963.|$|E

25|$|As women {{increasingly}} worked {{outside of}} the home, daytime television viewing declined. New generations of potential viewers were not raised watching soap operas with their mothers, leaving the shows' long and complex storylines foreign to younger audiences. Now, as viewers age, ratings continue to drop among young adult women, the demographic group that soap opera advertisers pay the most for. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> watch in workplace breakrooms are not counted, as Nielsen does not track television viewing outside the home. The rise of cable and the internet has also provided new sources of entertainment during the day. The genre's decline has additionally been attributed to reality television displacing soap operas as TV's dominant form of melodrama. An early term for the reality TV genre was docu-soap. A precursor to reality TV, the televised 1994–95 O. J. Simpson murder case, both preempted and competed with an entire season of soaps, transforming viewing habits and leaving soap operas with 10 percent fewer viewers after the trial ended.|$|E
25|$|Several {{organizations}} {{dedicated to}} saving Jews were created {{and run by}} Catholic Poles {{with the help of}} the Polish Jewish underground. Among those, Żegota, the Council to Aid Jews, was the most prominent. It was unique not only in Poland, but in all of Nazi-occupied Europe, as there was no other organization dedicated solely to that goal. Żegota concentrated its efforts on saving Jewish children toward whom the Germans were especially cruel. Tadeusz Piotrowski (1998) gives several wide-range estimates of a number of survivors including <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> have received assistance from Żegota in some form including financial, legal, medical, child care, and other help in times of trouble. The subject is shrouded in controversy according to Szymon Datner, but in Lukas' estimate about half of those who survived within the changing borders of Poland were helped by Żegota. The number of Jews receiving assistance who did not survive the Holocaust is not known.|$|E
25|$|According to Mendhenhall, {{pressures}} from outside invaders led the loosely bound Israelite tribes to converge into monarchical unity for stability and solidarity. He {{also argues that}} during this consolidation, the new state also had to unify the religious traditions {{that belonged to the}} different groups to prevent dissent from <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>might</b> believe that the formation of a state would replace direct governance from God. Therefore, Mendenhall continues, these loosely bound tribes merged under the Mosaic covenant to legitimize their unity. They believed that to obey the law was to obey God. They also believed that the king was put into power as a result of God's benefaction, and that this accession was the fulfillment of God's promise of dynasty to David. Mendenhall also notes that a conflict arose between those who believed in the Davidic covenant, and those who believed that God would not support all actions of the state. As a result, both sides became relatively aloof, and the Davidic covenant and the Mosaic covenant were almost entirely forgotten.|$|E
