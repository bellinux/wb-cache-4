5000|$|Isostatic powder {{compacting}} is a mass-conserving shaping process. Fine metal {{particles are}} placed into a flexible mould and then high gas or fluid pressure {{is applied to}} the mould. The resulting article is then sintered in a furnace which increases the strength of the part by bonding the metal particles. This manufacturing process produces very little scrap metal and {{can be used to make}} many different shapes. The tolerances that this process can achieve are very precise, ranging from +/- 0.008 inches (0.2 mm) for axial dimensions and +/- 0.020 inches (0.5 mm) for radial dimensions. This is the most efficient type of powder compacting (<b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>subcategories</b> <b>are</b> also from this reference). [...] This operation is generally applicable on small production quantities, as it is more costly to run due to its slow operating speed and the need for expendable tooling.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{experiences}} of nursing students being trained to perform vaccinations. Methods: The grounded theory method was applied to gather information through semi-structured interviews. The participants included 14 undergraduate nursing students in their fifth and eighth semesters of study in a nursing school in Iran. The information was analyzed according to Strauss and Corbin’s method of grounded theory. Results: A core category of experiential learning <b>was</b> identified, and <b>the</b> <b>following</b> eight <b>subcategories</b> <b>were</b> extracted: students’ enthusiasm, vaccination sensitivity, stress, proper educational environment, absence of prerequisites, students’ responsibility for learning, providing services, and learning outcomes. Conclusion: The vaccination training of nursing students {{was found to be}} in an acceptable state. However, some barriers to effective learning were identified. As such, {{the results of this study}} may provide empirical support for attempts to reform vaccination education by removing these barriers...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho objetivou conhecer a influência de atividades lúdicas no tratamento de pacientes com Insuficiência Renal Crônica Terminal, durante a hemodiálise. Foi utilizada uma abordagem qualitativa a partir de entrevistas semi-estruturadas. O estudo foi realizado com 16 pacientes de uma clínica de hemodiálise. Foi percebida uma categoria definida como a capacidade de as pessoas entenderem, de maneira positiva ou negativa, suas experiências. As subcategorias são: percepção positiva, considerada como todo sentimento desvelado pelo paciente por meio das atividades lúdicas como bem-estar; percepção negativa é todo sentimento de indiferença por tais atividades. Os resultados revelaram que as atividades lúdicas influenciam positivamente a vida da maioria dos pacientes, proporcionando bem-estar. Mesmo os que se mostraram indiferentes, admitiram ter gostado da experiência. Acreditamos que os resultados reforçam a necessidade de a enfermagem buscar ações mais humanizadas nas unidades de diálise This paper {{aimed at}} knowing the {{influence}} of playful activities on the treatment of patients with Terminal Chronic Renal Failure during hemodialysis. A qualitative approach, based on semi-structured interviews, was used. The study was performed with 16 patients in a hemodialysis unit. A category, defined as the individual ability of understanding their experiences, in a positive or negative way <b>was</b> observed. <b>The</b> <b>following</b> <b>subcategories</b> <b>were</b> developed: positive understanding, defined as the great care showed by patients through the playful activities, such as welfare; negative understanding, such as the indifference shown through the playful activities. The results showed that playful activities had {{a positive influence on}} most of the patients’ life, causing feelings of welfare. Even those patients indifferent to playful activities assumed that they enjoyed playing. We believe the results reinforce the nursing necessity of pursuing more humanistic actions in dialysis unit...|$|R
