5|$|Early on the {{community}} tried several names, rejecting Albion, All Saints, Lowell, Brooklyn, Addiseville and Winona.

5|$|The {{history of}} Briarcliff Manor {{can be traced}} back to the {{founding}} of a settlement between the Hudson and Pocantico Rivers in the 19th century.

5|$|Around 180 BCE the Indo-Greek king Agathocles issued some coinage bearing {{images of}} deities <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> {{interpreted}} as being related to Vaisnava imagery in India. The deities {{displayed on the}} coins appear to be Vishnu's avatars Balarama-Sankarshana with attributes consisting of the Gada mace and the plow, and Vasudeva-Krishna with attributes of the Shankha (conch) and the Sudarshana Chakra wheel. According to Bopearachchi, the headdress {{on top of the}} deity is actually a misrepresentation of a shaft with a half-moon parasol on top (chattra).|$|E
5|$|At one time, {{there were}} {{detailed}} contemporaneous histories on Caligula, {{but they are}} now lost. Additionally, the historians who wrote them are described as biased, either overly critical or praising of Caligula. Nonetheless, these lost primary sources, along with the works of Seneca and Philo, were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Caligula written by the next generations of historians. A few of the contemporaneous historians are known by name. Fabius Rusticus and Cluvius Rufus both wrote condemning histories on Caligula <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> lost. Fabius Rusticus {{was a friend of}} Seneca who was known for historical embellishment and misrepresentation. Cluvius Rufus was a senator involved in the assassination of Caligula.|$|E

5|$|By 1920, due {{in large}} part to the city's {{economic}} prosperity, Cleveland became the nation's fifth largest city. The city counted Progressive Era politicians such as the populist Mayor Tom L. Johnson among its leaders. In commemoration of the centennial of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the Great Lakes Exposition debuted in June 1936 along the Lake Erie shore north of downtown. Conceived as a way to energize a city after the Great Depression, it drew four million visitors in its first season, and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937. The exposition was housed on grounds <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> used by the Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Burke Lakefront Airport, among others.|$|E
5|$|Dark Forces {{gameplay}} expands on the FPS {{standards set}} by Doom in 1993, and features gameplay elements <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> common in the FPS genre. These include the ability to look up and down, duck, and jump. A variety of power-ups are {{made available to the}} player, including health, shields, weapons and ammunition. The game also features several non-combat items to aid the player. The head lamp illuminates the area in front of the player, but will reveal the player's position to enemies in dark rooms. Ice cleats provide traction in icy areas, and an air mask protects the player from areas with toxic atmosphere. Many inventory items are powered by batteries (separate from weapon ammunition types) which can be found around the levels.|$|E
5|$|Descriptions {{from early}} explorers and {{settlers}} give {{some idea of}} what the Pine Creek Gorge was like before it was clearcut. The forest was up to 85percent hemlock and white pine, with the rest hardwoods. Many animal species <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> vanished inhabited the area. A herd of 12,000American bison migrated along the West Branch Susquehanna River in 1773. Pine Creek was home to large predators such as wolves, lynx, wolverines, panthers, fishers, foxes and bobcats, all save the last three now locally extinct. The area had herds of elk and deer, and large numbers of black bears, river otters, and beavers. In 1794, two of the earliest white explorers to travel up Pine Creek found so many rattlesnakes on its banks that they had to sleep in their canoe. Further upstream, insects forced them to do the same.|$|E

5|$|Grassi's {{arguments}} and conclusions were criticised {{in a subsequent}} article, Discourse on Comets, published {{under the name of}} one of Galileo's disciples, a Florentine lawyer named Mario Guiducci, although it had been largely written by Galileo himself. Galileo and Guiducci offered no definitive theory of their own on the nature of comets although they did present some tentative conjectures <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> known to be mistaken. In its opening passage, Galileo and Guiducci's Discourse gratuitously insulted the Jesuit Christopher Scheiner, and various uncomplimentary remarks about the professors of the Collegio Romano were scattered throughout the work. The Jesuits were offended, and Grassi soon replied with a polemical tract of his own, The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance, under the pseudonym Lothario Sarsio Sigensano, purporting to be one of his own pupils.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, Joel Asaph Allen was {{the first}} to scientifically {{describe}} Transandinomys talamancae, when he named Oryzomys talamancae from a specimen from Talamanca, Costa Rica. He placed it in the genus Oryzomys, then more broadly defined than it is now, and compared it to both the marsh rice rat (O.palustris) and to O.laticeps. Several other names <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> recognized as synonyms of Transandinomys talamancae were introduced in the following years. In 1899, Allen described Oryzomys mollipilosus, O.magdalenae, and O.villosus from Magdalena Department, Colombia. Oldfield Thomas added O.sylvaticus from Santa Rosa, Ecuador in 1900 and O.panamensis from Panama City, Panama, in 1901. In the same year, Wirt Robinson and Markus Lyon named Oryzomys medius from near La Guaira, Venezuela. Allen added O.carrikeri from Talamanca, Costa Rica, in 1908.|$|E
5|$|Kerst {{returned}} to the University of Illinois after the war. From 1953 to 1957 he was technical director of the Midwestern Universities Research Association, where he worked on advanced particle accelerator concepts, most notably the FFAG accelerator. He developed the spiral-sector focusing principle, which {{lies at the heart}} of many spiral ridge cyclotrons <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> in operation around the world. His team devised and analysed beam stacking, a process of radio frequency acceleration in fixed field machines that led to the development of the colliding beam accelerators.|$|E
