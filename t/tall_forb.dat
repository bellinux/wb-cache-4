40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} plant interactions in producing the zonation of strong competitors, i. e. clonal dominants, and weak competitors, i. e. interstitials. In addition, it was tested whether the effect of plant interactions on species richness depends on the position on the flooding gradient. During one growing season vegetation canopy was removed at a low elevation, dominated by Phragmites australis and at a high one, dominated by tall forbs, mainly Urtica dioica. The seed bank was examined and in half of the plots seeds of clonal dominants from high elevations and interstitials from low elevations were sown to ensure that seeds of both groups were present at both zones. At both elevations, removal of vegetation canopy resulted in a strong increase of interstitial species, but interstitials from low elevations failed to establish in cleared plots at the <b>tall</b> <b>forb</b> zone. This could not {{be attributed to the}} absence of seeds and we concluded that conditions unfavourable for germination, rather than plant interactions determine the zonation of interstitials from the P. australis zone. Many seedlings of <b>tall</b> <b>forb</b> dominants emerged in cleared plots at the low elevation. However, number of seedlings rapidly declined during the first year. Hence, abiotic conditions, most probably flooding, prevented seedling establishment of <b>tall</b> <b>forb</b> dominants at zones dominated by P. australis. Canopy removal increased species richness at the low elevation in the first year only, whereas at the higher elevation species richness in cleared plots remained higher throughout the second year when the canopy was no longer removed. We therefore concluded that species richness of freshwater shorelines is controlled by abiotic factors in the frequently flooded zone and by plant interactions at higher elevations.

40|$|Oenanthe silaifolia was {{considered}} to be extinct in the Netherlands. The species was recorded for the last time in 1899, in a floodplain meadow near Rotterdam. Recently, the species has been found again – with only one individual – on a dike in the valley of the Maas near Stevensweert (central Limburg). The plant was growing in a ruderalized <b>tall</b> <b>forb</b> community, halfway on the dike, that could be classified as a basal community of Cirsium arvense of the class Artemisietea vulgaris. The stand was surrounded by herds of Phalaris arundinacea (along the foot of the dike) and hay meadow communities of the Arrhenatherion elatioris, the latter comprising some specific floodplain species like Ononis repens subsp. spinosa and Eryngium campestre. Most probably, the plant originates from French Lorraine, from where seeds were transported by the river Maas. Of course, no guarantees can be given for the preservation of the species at the new locality, but a management of hay cutting seems to be a prerequisite to give the plant a chance to survive and to build up a stable population...|$|E

40|$|Recruitment {{of plant}} species in {{wetlands}} dominated by Phragmites australis {{often results in}} a zonation of two vegetation types. A development of reed marshes {{takes place in the}} shallow flooded parts where the dominant P. australis becomes accompanied by interstitial marsh species. The vegetation on higher elevations becomes dominated by <b>tall</b> <b>forbs.</b> We investigated whether this zonation is related to the effects of flooding on the recruitment of component species of both vegetation types. All but one species had maximum germination at field capacity and germination was strongly reduced in drier soils and flooded soils. Nearly all seedlings of reed marsh species, irrespective of whether they initially supported two or six true leaves, survived eight weeks of total inundation. Survival of <b>tall</b> <b>forbs</b> was however significantly decreased by inundation. At both seedling stages a considerable number of Cirsium arvense lost their leaves when submerged, but all plants were able to recover when drained. Eupatorium cannabinum suffered extra mortality when transferred from flooded to drained conditions, whereas only young seedlings of Epilobium hirsutum died. Of all investigated species E. hirsutum was the only one with a significantly increased stem length after one week of submergence. Root porosities did not differ between reed marsh species and <b>tall</b> <b>forbs</b> but stem porosities of the reed marsh species Mentha aquatica and Lycopus enropaeus were significantly higher than those of the <b>tall</b> <b>forbs</b> C. arvense and E. cannabinum. It was concluded that both reed marsh species and <b>tall</b> <b>forbs</b> require lowered water levels for germination. Flooding during the seedling stage will assign species to their position on the elevation gradient. Reed marsh species establish at lower elevations because they are best able to survive flooding and because their higher stem porosities allows them to withstand higher levels of partial submergence.

40|$|In the Netherlands, nature {{management}} {{changed from}} conservation into active nature restoration. Restoration by reintroduction of natural processes including grazing is named "nature development". In 1992 the World Wildlife Fund announced the plan 'Living Rivers Plan'. One {{of the first}} nature development projects the 'Millingerwaard', started in 1991 by introduction of grazing by free foraging horses and cattle. One of the aims was the restoration of dry levee grasslands and in particular of the Medicagini-Avenetum which is threatened in the Netherlands. We studied the effect of nature development on vegetation, especially on dry levee grasslands (MedicaginiAvenetum, Bromo-Eryngietum) and on 'fluviatile species'. Permanent plots and repeated vegetation mapping was used to investigate changes. Classification was done by TWINSPAN. CCA and DCA were used to relate with environmental variables and to detect successional pathways. A succession scheme was drawn and changes in surface area of the different communities were calculated. After 14 years the surface area of the nitrophylous <b>tall</b> <b>forb</b> communities of the Galio-Urticetea strongly increased, while the Bromo-Eryngietum decreased. The Sedo-Cerastion ruderalized. On the levee nature development did not influence the total cover of Medicagini-Avenetum and the fluviatile species. Vegetation changes appear to be very dynamic showing both regressive and progressive succession. After 14 years of nature development, still no real improvement of the dry species rich Sedo-Cerastion grasslands occurred. This is most probably due to insufficient grazing intensity. Ruderalization of these grasslands can only be prevented if grazing intensity is sufficient to preserve short swards. Managers should either direct the herds or make sure that in the growing season the levees are sufficiently grazed because of an overall high grazing intensity in the area. Reintroduction of plant species might be necessary...|$|E
40|$|Currently {{there is}} no {{comprehensive}} terrestrial ecosystem classification for the Central Rocky Mountains of the United States. Fundamentals of the British Columbian biogeoclimatic classification system, together with elements of the Daubenmire habitat type, Mueggler community type, and the USDA Forest Service Terrestrial Ecological Unit Inventory approaches, were used to develop a classification of ecosystems in a montane-subalpine watershed (10, 000 ha, 2, 000 - 3, 000 m elevation) in northern Utah. As is typical in the Central Rocky Mountains, vegetation complexity within the watershed {{is associated with a}} steep elevation gradient, as well as great diversity in landform, parent material, and disturbance history. An exploration of fundamental drivers associated with diverse vegetation and feasible stratification of that heterogeneous landscape is a main research objective. We sampled both forest (spruce-fir, Douglas-fir, aspen, juniper, and mahogany woodland) and non-forest (willow riparian, sagebrush, <b>tall</b> <b>forb</b> meadow) ecosystems in terms of existing plant communities, topo-edaphic, and physiognomic features; 163 sites were described in the watershed in terms of, e. g., elevation, landform, slope, aspect, nutrient pools and dynamics. We used SNOTEL and COOP databases for relevant climatic data. We analyzed this complex dataset by ordination and classification to gain insight into fundamental factors/gradients associated with diverse vegetation. Mesoclimate (regional climate) effectively discriminates between three vegetation zones (vegetation-climatic classification) and serves as the basic framework for site classification. For each zone, we are able to construct an edatopic grid with axes represented by topo-edaphic regime (local climate) and soil nutrient regime. These three principal gradients account together for half of the total variance in the dataset. The ecosystem classification provides considerable insight into the distribution of, and ecological relationships between, different ecosystems (e. g., conifer, aspen, woodland, and riparian/wetland) ...|$|E

Das {{qualitative}} Ausmaß der Veränderungen konnte am Beispiel des mittleren Ostetals durch den Vergleich genauer Vegetationskarten und Dauerquadrataufnahmen analysiert werden. Der drastische Artenzahlrückgang ist verbunden mit der Dominanz weniger, hochwüchsiger Arten. Phalaridetum, Glycerietum, Filipendula- und Convolvuletalia-Gesellschaften sind auch noch nach 30 Jahren Brache Folgegesellschaften des Senecioni-Brometum. Aufgrund ihrer Konstitutionsmerkmale (Nährstoffakkumulation, Phytomasseproduktion und Fähigkeit, mit kräftigen Rhizomausläufern hohe Streuauflagen zu durchwachsen) sind Filipendula, Glyceria oder Phalaris in der Lage, in allen Ausbildungen der Sumpfdotterblumen-Wassergreiskrautwiesen schnell die Vorherrschaft zu gewinnen. Standorttypische Gehölze benachbarter Alno-Ulmion-Gesellschaften konnten sich infolge starker Beschattung noch nicht etablieren. Nach Wiederaufnahme der Nutzung ist bereits in den ersten 3 Jahren ein gravierender Ertragsrückgang festzustellen. In den nicht gedüngten Mädesüß-, Wasserschwaden- und Rohrglanzgras-Brachen wird bei zweimaliger Mahd bereits nach 3 Jahren eine erfolgsversprechende Restitution artenreicher Sumpfdotterblumenwiesen eingeleitet: viele Kennarten charakterisieren den rapiden Anstieg der Artenzahl. Die Reversibilität der Bracheentwicklung kann mit einer schnellen "biologischen Auslagerung" der naturnahen (nicht meliorierten) Brachestandorte erklärt werden. Species-rich meadows (Calthion communities) of the Oste {{valley in}} northwestern Germany (mowed twice a year) developed into stands of reeds and tall forbs (such as Filipendula ulmaria, Glyceria maxima, Phalaris arundinacea and Urtica dioica) with low species diversity when the management was abandoned. Changes in species composition and dominance, {{as well as}} a marked decline in the species diversity per plot are distinct. The change from marsh-marigold meadows (Senecioni-Brometum) to tall grass-reeds and/or <b>tall</b> <b>forb</b> communities proceeds rapidly: The expansion of some of the component species of the "initial floristic composition" occured in the first years after abandonment. Dominant populations of the taller species inhibit succession both shortly after abandonment and over the long run. The major constraint on succession is shade: from the dominant plant species themselves as well as from a dense litter layer. These stands become slowly enriched, because environmental inputs are stored in the living plant material. Over a period of 3 — 5 years, a re-establishment of a mowing routine results in a rapid reduction of aboveground biomass, combined with a rapid increase in species richness. Decreases in available resources due to interruption of internal translocation inhibit the growth of the formerly dominant plant species. As result species of the Senecioni-Brometum meadows are able to become established. The ability to grow with fewer resources and the removal of the aboveground biomass (2 x/year, fulfilling a demand for light) favor coexistence. The regeneration experiment has already been quite successful. Management costs may be reduced for some years by restricting the mowing frequency, without an ultimate loss in species diversity...|$|E

40|$|Question: How are {{plant species}} and {{functional}} group compo-sition, and potential sward height affected by implementation of different grazing regimes on previously abandoned semi-natural grassland? Location: The Jizerské mountains, northern Czech Republic. Methods: We established a randomized block {{experiment with the}} following treatments: unmanaged control (U), intensive (IG) and extensive (EG) continuous grazing, first cut followed by intensive (ICG) and first cut followed by extensive (ECG) continuous grazing {{for the rest of}} the growing season. The percentage cover of all vascular plant species was recorded in 40 permanent plots. Results: Total plant species richness increased in all managed treatments, whereas species number was reduced in U at the end of the experiment. <b>Tall</b> <b>forbs</b> (Aegopodium podagraria, Galium album, Anthriscus sylvestris, Cirsium arvense) as well as tall grasses (Elytrigia repens and Alopecurus pratensis) were more abundant in U. Species associated with both grazing treatments (IG, EG) were Dactylis glomerata, Festuca rubra agg. and Phleum pratense. Agrostis capillaris, Taraxacum spp., Trifolium repens, Ranunculus repens and Cirsium vulgare were promoted by ECG and ICG. Abundance of tall grasses and <b>tall</b> <b>forbs</b> reflected the intensity of management in the order U>EG, ECG>IG, ICG. Prostrate forbs, on the other hand, increased their cover with increasing intensity: ICG>IG>ECG>EG. Conclusions: Plant species composition of semi-natural grass-lands is affected by the defoliation regime. Continuous grazing on abandoned grassland alters the sward structure towards a permanent pasture with short, light-sensitive grasses and pros-trate forbs. To maintain or enhance plant species richness in semi-natural grasslands, understanding the effects of different grazing regimes on plant species composition is necessary...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Green roofs perform {{ecosystem}} {{services such as}} summer roof temperature reduction and stormwater capture that directly contribute to lower building energy use and potential economic savings. These services are in turn related to ecosystem functions performed by the vegetation layer such as radiation reflection and transpiration, but little work has examined the role of plant species composition and diversity in improving these functions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a replicated modular extensive (shallow growing- medium) green roof system planted with monocultures or mixtures containing one, three or five life-forms, to quantify two {{ecosystem services}}: summer roof cooling and water capture. We also measured the related ecosystem properties/processes of albedo, evapotranspiration, and the mean and temporal variability of aboveground biomass over four months. Mixtures containing three or five life-form groups, simultaneously optimized several green roof ecosystem functions, outperforming monocultures and single life-form groups, but there was much variation in performance depending on which life-forms {{were present in the}} three life-form mixtures. Some mixtures outperformed the best monocultures for water capture, evapotranspiration, and an index combining both water capture and temperature reductions. Combinations of <b>tall</b> <b>forbs,</b> grasses and succulents simultaneously optimized a range of ecosystem performance measures, thus the main benefit of including all three groups was not to maximize any single process but to perform a variety of functions well. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Ecosystem services from green roofs can be improved by planting certain life-form groups in combination, directly contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. The strong performance by certain mixtures of life-forms, especially <b>tall</b> <b>forbs,</b> grasses and succulents, warrants further investigation into niche complementarity or facilitation as mechanisms governing biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in green roof ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|The Szigetköz is {{situated}} in the northwest part of Hungary. In the late 19 th century, a flood protection dam was built, which divided the original floodplain into an active part and an inundation-free part. In 1992, most {{of the water in}} the main Danube channel was diverted into a canal built to supply the hydroelectric power plant at B?s. This large-scale modification led to – among other things – the decline of surface water level in the active floodplain as well as the drop of groundwater depth beyond the dikes. The region’s wetland vegetation was characteristically rich in species due to a favorable water supply and the wealth of propagules (seeds, fruits, shoots with live buds) dispersed over the area by recurring floods. The area supports only few rare species. Instead, its real value lies in the vast richness of species compositions: montane and lowland species often grow side by side. The degree of naturalness varies greatly for the different parts of the Szigetköz ranging from intensively managed arable fields under constant human influence to pristine wilderness proposed to be placed under strict legal protection. Plantations of hybrid poplar also cover extensive areas. The most severe water level decline took place on the active floodplain at the section of the Great Danube channel right upstream of the canal supplying the hydroelectric power plant. Even beyond the flood protection dams there are scattered patches of considerable botanical value, despite most of the land there being under cultivation. These precious habitat islands are dispersed across the area, and their water supply is largely ensured already or can be easily remedied due to their proximity to canals or former river channels. Terrestrial plants have very quickly established in the dried-up riverbed of the Old Danube channel. In the first years, the exposed gravel substrate abounded in usual riparian plant species otherwise common on bars. On the new shoreline, a 30 m wide belt of white willow (Salix alba) has developed. Above this, a zone of water-demanding <b>tall</b> <b>forb</b> community has established which tolerates temporary inundation. Further away up to the original shoreline, a strip of vegetation composed of box elder (Acer negundo) has appeared. Unlike the white willow belt, this zone developed slowly. At first, knee-high box elder saplings vegetated in the dry grassland, but once their roots has reached permanently wet soil layers, their growth has greatly accelerated. In the former riverbed, the mass appearance of invasive plants (Acer negundo, Ailanthus altissima, Solidago gigantea, Aster lanceolatus, Fallopia x bohemica) raises serious concerns for nature protection...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} effect of {{increasing}} sample units density with presence-only data (PO data) {{on the ability to}} predict the distribution of three common (2 e dwarf shrub heath, 4 b bilberry birch forest and 9 c fen) and three rare (3 b <b>tall</b> <b>forb</b> meadow, 8 d rich swamp forest and 9 d mud- bottom fens and bogs) vegetation types. The chosen study area was Venabygdsfjellet in Ringebu municipality, Oppland. In 2001 the vegetation in the study area was mapped by Norwegian Institute for Forest and Landscape. The vegetation map was used as material for the PO data in the prediction modeling. In beforehand, this map was quality assessed. To evaluate the quality of the map, necessary fieldwork and statistical analysis was conducted. As a result of this evaluation, 84 % of all observations correspond to the mapped distribution on the vegetation map. The PO data for distribution modeling were collected in a point grid with different densities (100 m for common and 25 m for rare vegetation types) within the sample units (1500 × 600 m size). The sample unit was equivalent to a Primary Statistical Unit (PSU) of the AR 18 × 18 survey system and given in a grid net with five densities: 3 × 3 km, 4, 5 × 4, 5 km, 6 × 6 km, 7, 5 × 7, 5 km and 9 × 9 km. In addition to PO data, 12 environmental variables were used as explanatory predictors (the digital elevation model, basin, curvatures, flow accumulation, flow direction, groundwater, slope, satellite image, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Topographic Wetness index (TWI), sediment and soil maps). Using the PO data and these environmental variables, each vegetation type was modeled in all five densities of the PSU grid using a maximum entropy modeling method using a custom-made software called MaxEnt. In total, 26 out of 30 planned prediction models were run. The four missing models did not have any PO-points in some of the PSU grid density. Out of 26, 23 prediction models performed well according to the AUC-measure provided by MaxEnt (> 0. 80 AUC). The statistical comparison of the predicted and true distribution of the modeled vegetation types showed that only 7 prediction models can be considered as good (2 e in densities 3 × 3 km and 4. 5 × 4. 5 km, 4 b in densities 3 × 3 km and 4. 5 × 4. 5 km, 9 c in densities 3 × 3 km and 7. 5 × 7. 5 km and 3 b in density 3 × 3 km). The vegetation types 8 d and 9 d were not modeled successfully any PSU grid densities, although they had high AUCvalues. The best modeled vegetation type was 4 b in a 3 x 3 km PSU grid density.

40|$|Traditional {{haymaking}} {{has created}} exceptionally {{high levels of}} plant species diversity in semi-natural grasslands of the Carpathian Mountains (Romania), the maintenance of which is jeopardized by recent abandonment and subsequent vegetation succession. We tested {{the hypothesis that the}} different life history strategies of dominant grasses cause different patterns of diversity loss after abandonment of traditional haymaking in two types of meadow. Although diversity loss rate was not significantly different, the mechanism of loss depended on the life history of dominant species. In meadows co-dominated by competitive stress-tolerant ruderals, diversity loss occurred following the suppression of dominant grasses by <b>tall</b> <b>forbs,</b> whereas in meadows dominated by a stress-tolerant competitor, diversity loss resulted from increased abundance and biomass of the dominant grass.

40|$|Surface {{mining and}} {{subsequent}} reclamation {{often results in}} the establishment of large areas of grassland that can benefit wildlife. Grasslands have declined substantially over the last 150 years, resulting in declines of many grassland birds. The dickcissel (Spiza americana), a neotropical migrant, is one such bird whose numbers have declined in the last 30 years due to habitat loss, increased nest predation and parasitism, and over harvest (lethally controlled as an agricultural pest on its wintering range in Central and South America). Reclaimed surface-mined lands have been documented to provide important breeding habitat for dickcissels in the United States, emphasizing the importance of reclamation efforts. Objectives were to understand specific aspects of dickcissel nesting ecology (i. e., nest-site selection, nest success, and nest parasitism, and identification of nest predators) on 2 spatial scales on TXU Energy?s Big Brown Mine, near Fairfield, Texas, and to subsequently provide TXU Energy with recommendations to improve reclaimed areas as breeding habitat for dickcissels. I examined the influence of nest-site vegetation characteristics and the effects of field-level spatial factors on dickcissel nesting ecology on 2 sites reclaimed as wildlife habitat. Additionally, I developed a novel technique to identify predators at active nests during the 2003 field season. During 2002 ? 2003, 119 nests were monitored. On smaller spatial scales, dickcissels were likely to select nest-sites with low vegetation, high densities of bunchgrasses and <b>tall</b> <b>forbs,</b> and areas with higher clover content. Probability of nest success increased with nest heights and vegetation heights above the nest, characteristics associated with woody nesting substrates. Woody nesting substrates were selected and bunchgrasses were avoided. Oak (Quercus spp.) saplings remained an important nesting substrate throughout the breeding season. On a larger scale, nest-site selection was likely to occur farther from wooded riparian areas and closer to recently-reclaimed areas. Nest parasitism was likely to occur near roads and wooded riparian areas. Results suggest reclaimed areas could be improved by planting more bunchgrasses, <b>tall</b> <b>forbs</b> (e. g., curly-cup gumweed [Grindelia squarrosa] and sunflower [Helianthus spp. ]), clover (Trifolium spp.), and oaks (a preferred nesting substrate associated with higher survival rates).

Research and monitoring efforts on pikas across the western USA have collectively shown the nuance and complexity with which climate will often act on species in diverse topographic and climatic contexts. However, to date no studies have investigated habitat, distribution, and abundance of pikas across hundreds of sites within a remote wilderness area. Additionally, relatively {{little is known about}} whether climate acts most strongly on pikas through direct or indirect (e. g., vegetation-mediated) mechanisms. During 2007 - 2009, we collectively hiked > 16, 000 km throughout the 410, 077 -ha Glacier National Park, Montana, USA, in an effort to identify topographic, microrefugial, and vegetative characteristics predictive of pika abundance. We identified 411 apparently pika-suitable habitat patches with binoculars (in situ), and surveyed 314 of them for pika signs. Ranking of alternative logistic-regression models based on AICc scores revealed that short-term pika abundances were positively associated with intermediate elevations, greater cover of mosses, and <b>taller</b> <b>forbs,</b> and decreased each year, for a total decline of 68 % during the three-year study; whereas longer-term abundances were associated only with static variables (longitude, elevation, gradient) and were lower on north-facing slopes.

We recommend that wildlife monitoring account for this seasonal and diel variation when surveying pikas.

Hegi, a tetraploid fescue species {{native to the}} <b>tall</b> <b>forbs</b> communities of south-eastern Europe at altitudes between 1100 and 2200 m a. s. l. {{has been the subject}} of some debate by grass taxonomists. Our cytogenetic analyses including fluorescence in situ hybridisation with probes for genomic DNA and selected DNA repeats revealed the species to be allotetraploid and derived from interspecific hybridization between F. pratensis Huds., a species confined to grassland at lower altitudes, and a so far unknown Festuca species. Besides tetraploids, triploids and pentaploids were found growing in Alpine meadows in close association with F. pratensis subsp. apennina. Triploid cytotypes predominated at many sites in Switzerland and Romania, and in some localities, they were the only cytotypes observed. Cytogenetic analyses revealed the triploids to be hybrids between diploid F. pratensis and tetraploid Festuca pratensis subsp. apennina, while the pentaploid cytotypes originated from hybridization between F. pratensis subsp. apennina and hexaploid F. arundinacea Schreb., a closely-related species growing in a close vicinity to F. pratensis subsp. apennina. Parental genomes of F. pratensis subsp. apennina and of the triploid and pentaploid hybrids showed no evidence of homoeologous chromosome pairing and interspecific recombination, supporting previous observation of a disomic inheritance at meiosis, where chromosome pairing was restricted to bivalent associations. A hypothesis is presented that a chromosome pairing regulator(s), reported previously in other polyploid broad-leaved fescue species of the Festuca subg. Schedonorus, is present and functional in F. pratensis subsp. apennina. It is likely that a common ancestors’ genome that carries the chromosome pairing regulator(s) is present in all polyploid broad-leaved fescue species, and its acquisition was a key event that enabled speciation, and development of a polyploid series within Festuca. Identification of a functional chromosome pairing regulator capable of stabilizing advantageous genome combinations in hybrids within the Lolium-Festuca complex would greatly assist in development of stable Festulolium cultivars. Its expression within Festulolium amphiploid cultivars would assist strategies aimed at climate-proofing productive European grasslands to combat exposures to stress conditions...|$|R

A detailed survey of Quaternary deposits in boreholes and exposed sections provided a complete record of the basin. The most complete core was analyzed for palynology and magnetic properties. Plant macrofossils were obtained by flotation. Pollen and spectrometric analysis allowed a precise stratigraphic placement of a moose antler and braincase kept in museum collections. The basin originated from fluviatile obstruction of a tributary valley cut into bedrock. The basal deposits formed as a terrestrial hydromorphic soil under a dense Tsuga-forest (zone RNC 1). The overlying palustrine gyttja shows a marked forest withdrawal with a climatic signature (zone RNC 3), followed by a re-establishment of mixed conifer forests (zones RNC 4 to 6). The occurrence of pollen of arctic-alpine (Pinguicula, Saxifraga oppositifolia type) and other cold-adapted taxa (Saxifraga stellaris type, Larix), is the oldest so far known south of the Alps and suggests that mean summer temperature was near or even below the thermic tree limit. High herb diversity, partially referable to <b>tall</b> <b>forbs,</b> characterizes this zone. A further increase of water table can be assumed in the interval RNC 4 and RNC 5, as suggested from the expansion of pollen of aquatic plants. The find of Larix decidua L. cones demonstrates {{the existence of the}} European larch in the Early Pleistocene of the Alps, previously not identified at the species level. After the Serio river had reached the maximum Quaternary aggradation, the lake was rapidly filled up with turbiditic sediments. The identification of Cervalces latifrons (Johnson, 1874) by Azzaroli (1979) was confirmed. Pollen spectra obtained from clay fragments preserved in the braincase allowed us to constrain the stratigraphic position of these fossil remains in the lower palustrine portion of the sequence. Pollen and moose palaeoecology corroborate the reconstruction of a boreal landscape. The succession of Fornaci di Ranica is attributed to the late Early Pleistocene {{on the basis of the}} following elements: (i) the occurrence of an acme pollen zone of Tsuga, with Carya and Pterocarya; (ii) the low representation of Cedrus; (iii) the biochronology of Cervalces latifrons; (iv) normal fossil magnetic polarity, interpreted as part of the Jaramillo subchron on the basis of correlations with other studied sections from the same region, and, finally, (v) indications from the regional geological evolution...|$|R

In the Pretty Valley grassland plots, established in 1946, cattle grazing has prevented the large-scale regeneration {{of a number of}} <b>tall,</b> palatable <b>forbs</b> and short, palatable shrubs, while in the absence of grazing, the cover of these life forms increased substantially. The amount of bare ground and loose litter was significantly greater on the grazed compared with the ungrazed plot. Between 1979 and 1994, there was little or no identifiable trend in the cover of vegetation or bare ground at either the Pretty Valley grazed site, or two additional grazed grassland sites established nearby in 1979. The current condition of grazed grassland on the Bogong High Plains is interpreted as stable, yet degraded. Improvement in condition will occur in the absence of grazing. In the Rocky Valley open heathland plots, established in 1945, increases in shrub cover over the study period were due to growth of shrubs following the 1939 bushfires that burnt much of the Bogong High Plains.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{summarize}} our findings on grassland communities {{after more than}} ten years of research on spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation, phenology, productivity and species richness. Grassland species from the Pyrenees and Cantabric mountains are organized in guild, and coexistence was facilitated through vegetation stratification and temporal shifts in phenology between plant guilds. Graminoids were the most abundant group, developed earlier and grew <b>taller</b> than <b>forbs.</b> Most of the forms were rare plants and acted as fugitives. Some of the were relatively abundant either in the seed rain or in the soil seed bank, although in general reproduction by seeds was scarce. Feedback processes and spatiotemporal changes of resources at different scales, including fertility and available space by gap opening, interacted to produce community structure in subalpine grasslands. At the landscape scale, fertility was the main factor structuring grasslands communities, and although it varied gradually, two separated mesic and xeric community types resulted, as defined by plant species composition. Grazing was the main biotic disturbance and acted at several scales, increasing the space available for establishment and producing changes in composition. In montane grasslands there were changes in nitrogen fluxes in vole and mole mounds, resulting in an increase of funerals, annuals an non-mycorrhizal plants, such as Caryophyllaccae. Only in subalpine ant hills, among the bionically formed mounds, was possible to find species not present in the surrounding pasture, such as Fistula gautieri and Vicia Pyrenaica, usually found awn unstable slopes. In conclusion, community organization is an extremely complex process, resulting from the action of different feedbacks and stochastic mechanism operating at different spatial and temporal scales, and no simple mechanism explains the process...|$|R
40|$|The {{examination}} of 1976 herbarium specimens of Eupatorium chinense subsp. sachalinense var. oppositifolium and 908 of var. sachalinense revealed their distinct geographical and ecologial distribution patterns. Var. oppositifolium includes two distinct groups: the diploid type and the polyploid one. The {{distribution of the}} diploid type is restricted to the "Sohayaki-Region", and its habitat appears to be restricted to fragile gravitational slopes and rocky areas which lack tall competitors. In contrast, the polyploid type is widely distributed throughout the Japan Archipelago. The polyploids grow successfully in recently cleared dry habitats and in repeatedly disturbed <b>tall</b> grass and <b>forb</b> communities. Climatic warming after the last~glaciation combined with explosive agricultural developments and the polyploids rapid and tall growth habits with agamospermous reproduction seem to have facilitated their north-ward migration and distributional expansion. Karyotype analyses were made on 29 populations of var. oppositifolium which comprised eight cytotypes: 2 x, 3 x, 4 x, 5 x based on x = 10, 3 ehromosomally deficient polyploids and an aneuploid with 2 n= 39. Most populations exhibited various com-binations of polyploid cytotypes. Different polyploid cytotypes how no apparent habitat preferences.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{small-scale}} fragmentation on the above-ground plant biomass was examined in nutrient-poor calcareous grasslands {{in the northern}} Swiss Jura mountains in three successive years. In the same field experiment, the fragmentation effect on the below-ground plant biomass was evaluated in I year. Additionally, species richness and abundance of plants were recorded. The experimental set-up consisted of 12 blocks with 48 fragments (24 small, 12 medium and 12 large) and 48 corresponding control plots distributed over three study sites. Fragmentation was maintained by frequently mowing the area between the fragments. Three to 5 years after {{the beginning of the}} experiment, plant biomass was harvested in all fragments and control plots in late autumn every year. In general, fragments contained more above- and below-ground plant biomass than control plots. The increase in above-ground plant biomass was partly due to an increased density of plants, and partly due to a change in species composition in fragments. In particular, a competitive shift of dominance towards <b>tall</b> grasses and <b>forbs</b> at the expense of smaller forbs was observed. Beside the main fragmentation effect on above-ground plant biomass, interactive effects with year of investigation, study site and plot size were found. This indicates that the observed fragmentation effect is a combined result of various factors acting to a different extent at different sites and plot sizes. The fragmentation-related increase in plant productivity could affect higher trophic levels such as herbivore and predator communities. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R

Populations have {{declined}} {{dramatically in the}} last 150 years from the conversion of prairie to agriculture {{and it is now}} listed as a “Tier I at-risk” species in Nebraska. We undertook a 3 -year project (2008 – 2010) to study the nest survival of Long-billed Curlews in Nebraska. We measured vegetation characteristics at each nest site (n = 14 nests) on two different spatial scales and used program MARK to model nest survival as a function of multiple covariates. Apparent nest survival was 29 % (n = 4 successful nests) and our model-based estimate of nest survival was 33 % (95 % CL: 24 %, 93 %). This estimate is similar to other estimates of curlew nest survival in Nevada (31 %) and South Dakota (15 % to 39 %). Visual obstruction reading height (βo. vor = – 4. 17, 95 % CL: – 7. 58, – 0. 77) and forb cover at the nest (βforb = – 12. 49, 95 % CL: – 26. 14, 1. 17) negatively affected survival. Bare ground cover positively affected nest survival (βbare = 3. 28, 95 % CL: – 1. 03, 7. 59), but we found no evidence that nest age, grass cover, or litter depth affected nest survival. These findings suggest that Long-billed Curlews in Nebraska have a relatively low nest survival rate, but it is within the expected range for the species.

40|$|North American {{populations of}} {{grassland}} birds have been declining consistently {{for the past}} several decades. Grassland birds respond to multiple scales which encompass a spectrum of habitat variables, and the habitat scale of importance may depend on the response of interest. For practitioners, having knowledge of the effect of scale is useful because conservation efforts can be focused at the most appropriate scale. However, previous multi-scale studies of grassland birds and other taxa have rarely incorporated on-the-ground habitat management while simultaneously investigating site-specific species turnover dynamics (Chapter 1) and daily nest survival (Chapter 2). Also, habitat management-related studies often suffer when not accounting for inherent variation between fields, field landscapes, and study year; thus, to disentangle specific effects of management, it is important to account for this variation by using these factors as random effects within mixed-effects models (Chapter 3). Understanding multi-scale habitat relationships affecting site turnover, also known as dynamic occupancy, and daily nest survival rate (nest survival or DSR), as well as how multiple avian responses vary with grassland management would further benefit conservation decision making for focal species. I investigated dynamic occupancy and nest survival of both obligate and facultative grassland species relative to multi-scale habitat factors on private lands (Conservation Reserve Program) in northwest Illinois during 2011 - 2014. I also conducted a separate analysis focusing on how multiple avian responses, ranging from species presence/absence (P/A) to species-specific nest survival, are influenced by non-fire grassland management treatments. 	For dynamic occupancy, a combination of ≥ 2 scales always outperformed single-scale models for all species. Three of 7 species responded to either cumulative habitat management (proportion of field managed over the study period) or yearly management (33 % of field managed before a particular breeding season) regardless of dominant grass type. Of the 48 covariates appearing in top models across species for both dynamic and single-season occupancy, microhabitat covariates (42 %) were represented most often, followed by patch-scale (33 %) and landscape-scale (25 %) factors. Covariates with the most consistent effects and the greatest frequencies appearing in competitive (∆AIC ≤ 4) dynamic and single-season occupancy models included landscape forest cover (n = 10), surrounding patch grassland cover (n = 7), and field size (n = 6). In general, increasing levels of forest cover adjoining fields had consistently negative effects on occupancy, colonization, and persistence across species, while grassland surrounding fields and field size had positive effects on these responses. Microhabitat covariates better explained colonization and extinction across the focal species. Of the 22 habitat covariates in top colonization and extinction models, microhabitat variables were represented 50 % of the time, compared to 32 % and 18 % representation for patch-scale and landscape-scale covariates, respectively. I recommend that wildlife biologists utilize habitat management techniques to ensure grassland birds have different successional stages within their range of preferences. My results suggest that grassland disturbance, while influencing turnover dynamics of different species, may be less influential within smaller fields and landscapes dominated by forest cover. 	I analyzed the daily nest survival rate for 2 species (red-winged blackbirds and dickcissels) and 2 groups of nesting communities (ground and above-ground nesters). Temporal variables such as Julian date and stage of nest were significant predictors of nest survival for red-wings (50. 58 ∆AICc = best temporal model) and dickcissels (2. 28 ∆AICc = best temporal model) in addition to habitat covariates. In 3 of 4 analyses ≥ 2 habitat scales were better predictors of nest survival over one scale. For ground nesters the patch scale was be best predictor of nest survival. However, the best model for ground nesters did not have overwhelming support compared to the random model (1. 43 ∆AICc). The ground-nesting community appeared to suffer decreased nest survival with increasing proportion of surrounding grassland. The blackbird top model included nest- and landscape-scale covariates, and top models for dickcissels and the above-ground nesting community included the nest- and patch-scale covariates. Blackbirds had a significant increase in nest survival when nests were placed in areas with higher vegetation density and height (greater visual obstruction). Comparatively, the predictive ability of habitat covariates was not as strong for the other 3 analyses; however, notable patterns include dickcissel nest survival decreasing with increasing nest distance to edge and above-ground nests had increased nest survival with increasing patch perimeter-area-ratio. My results suggest different species are responding to different scales, but finer-scale habitat covariates generally help predict nest survival over course-scale habitat features, such as landscape covariates. Songbird nest survival maybe more influenced by fine-scale habitat characteristics such as nesting cover and field vegetation complexity and density, which can deter nest predators and reduce their search efficiency. In a way, this is positive news for practitioners working in grasslands patches located in less than ideal patch or landscape configurations, suggesting more effort could be focused on improving conditions for colonization and persistence of focal species (Chapter 1). By focusing management on dynamic occupancy responses, increasing potential nesting habitat and territory quality for focal species will likely follow. 	When investigating multiple avian responses to management, within a consistent mixed-effect modeling framework, it appeared that avian survey related responses were best supported, having consistently larger ∆AICc values for top models, when compared to nesting-related data. One explanation of this relative difference could be attributed sample size difference between analyses. Focusing on the effects of management, this analysis accounted for inherent variation across fields, year, and potentially field landscape, as random effects within all models. As suggested from Chapter 2, and despite a large sample of nests, explanation of DSR across all species and focal species showed little improvement with management covariates. Brome fields cumulatively managed with spray or spray/seed treatments (Chapter 1) appeared to respond most and likely explained general positive effects for red-winged blackbird and dickcissel abundance; however, this was at a cost to species abundance for bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), Henslow’s sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii), eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), and northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), due to the release of <b>tall</b> <b>forbs</b> within the seed bank after spraying brome dominated fields. Dramatic vegetation responses in sprayed brome fields likely led to an overall decrease in obligate-grassland bird richness and conservation value on brome field types that were cumulatively management {{over the course of the}} study. These results suggest the importance of non-native brome CRP fields for certain grassland-obligate bird species, while also revealing the apparent decoupling of nest survival and other avian responses measured commonly. I suggest managers and researchers pay closer attention to variables affecting nesting abundance/density in grassland systems when possible and recognize the potential importance of non-native grasses for grassland-obligate birds in some regions...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{examining}} the interacting effects of ungulate herbivore pressure and site productivity on vegetation are mostly on grassland–grazing systems and have shown conflicting patterns. Here {{we examine the}} effects of deer density (3 ̆e 30 years differences in density between two landowners), site productivity (site index, SI) and stand age on subcanopy vegetation characteristics in 60 closed canopy, clear-cut originPopulus tremuloides dominated stands, Michigan, USA. Stand age effects were included because age varied among stands and can affect subcanopy vegetation patterns. Compared with fewer deer, stands with more deer had greater total forest floor vegetation mass, and its major components bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum), sedge (mostly Carex pensylvanica) and trees/shrubs 3 ̆c 0. 25 m <b>tall,</b> but lower <b>forb</b> mass and lower forest floor vegetation species richness and diversity. Deer density and SI had strong interacting effects on total forest floor mass, forb mass, and species richness. Forb mass increased with SI, but only in stands with fewer deer, whilst total vegetation mass was greater in stands with more deer at lower SI and declined with SI more sharply than for stands with fewer deer. Species richness increased with SI but more so at lower than higher deer density. Deer density and age had interacting effects on mass of trees/shrubs 3 ̆c 0. 25 m tall and sedge. Compared with fewer deer, stands with more deer had greater sedge and tree/shrub mass, and sedge mass decreased and tree/shrub mass increased more sharply with age. In lower deer stands there was a dense subcanopy tree and shrub strata within and beyond the reach of deer 0. 9 – 10 m tall whereas in higher deer stands this vegetation layer was nearly absent. We conclude that higher deer browse pressure in early successional Populus stands (1) strongly limits the recruitment of woody stems to larger (3 ̆e 0. 9 m tall) size classes, which could affect long-term successional trajectories, and (2) diminishes forb density and species richness, especially at higher site productivity, but increases total forest floor vegetation mass (mostly bracken fern and sedge), especially at lower site productivity. Given associations of bracken fern and sedge with poorer and/or more open sites and assuming high palatability of forbs, this pattern may result from the combination of selective herbivory and higher light availability caused by limited recruitment of trees and shrubs to taller strata...|$|R
40|$|Plant species co-existence {{may depend}} upon a complex {{chain of events}} {{involving}} competitive ability, complementarity and facilitation between plants and numerous interactions with herbivores, pathogens, soil features, fauna and micro-organisms. The co-existence of species in herbaceous vegetation is possible {{by the presence of}} factors that limit the expression of the dominance of plants. This limitation may operate through stress or disturbance or by a combination of the two, and its effect is usually to debilitate the potential dominants and to allow plants of smaller stature to regenerate and to co-exist with them. Species co-existence can reflect niche partitioning at several spatial and temporal scales. The functional strategies avoiding the temporal and/or spatial overlapping of the neighbouring individuals are key factors in the niche partitioning inside the plant community, so that species do not exclude each other by competition. Stress and disturbance are the two external factors affecting the vegetation. Their effects on the system change according their intensity. Stress includes factors which restrict the photosynthetic activity. In fact, plant biomass production in vegetation is subjected to a variety of environmental constraints, the most frequent of which are related to shortages and excesses in the supply of solar energy, water, and mineral nutrients. Disturbance includes mechanisms which limit the plant biomass by causing its partial or total destruction (grazing, mowing, forest cutting, soil erosion, and fire). Vegetation composition and species distribution may be influenced by negative processes (competition) and positive interactions (facilitation). Competition shows a maximal intensity in habitats with high productivity and low disturbance, while this phenomenon disappears under conditions of low productivity or intense disturbance. In order to obtain a more complete assessment of the role of these factors upon species density it is necessary to consider the rather different circumstances which arise when the intensities of stress and/or disturbance become severe. In harsh habitats plants are subjected to extreme stress or disturbance conditions, thus seedling establishment is promoted under the canopies of established vegetation. In this positive interaction, known as facilitation, some plants benefit from closely associated neighbours. The intensities of stress and/or disturbance experienced by herbaceous vegetation are sufficient, not only to eliminate potential dominants but also to produce local environments which are inhospitable to all, except a few specialised plants. Facilitation occurs widely but is more frequently documented in unproductive habitats and dominates under harsh conditions. Stress and disturbance involve functional responses by plants; thus, the analysis of plant functional traits (biological characteristics of plants responding to the dominant processes in an ecosystem) is a useful tool for the understanding of plant community assemblage. Grazing is a major disturbance which often causes extensive changes in plant richness and composition. However, pasture plants do not undergo herbivory passively, but react to defend themselves against grazers by means avoidance and tolerance strategies that enable them to survive and grow in grazed systems. Grazing avoidance involves mechanisms that reduce the probability and severity of grazing (mechanical and chemical defence or escape strategy), while grazing tolerance consists of mechanisms that promote growth following defoliation. The research aim was to assess how different types and intensity of disturbance affect species and functional composition of sub-Mediterranean and sub-desertic grassland systems, also in relation with environmental stress. Consequently, the specific research goals were to: i) identify changes in species and functional trait composition and in diversity of plant communities, under different disturbance types (grazing vs. mowing; mown vs. unmown meadows; grazed vs. ungrazed pastures; sheep grazing vs. horse grazing); ii) identify coenological and functional responses of grassland to intensity of stress and intensity and timing of disturbance, by analysing the plant functional traits, that are expression of competitive ability, facilitation, co-existence, avoidance and tolerance strategies; iii) identify plant-plant spatial interactions, i. e. whether species have species-specific spatial associations, especially in harsh environments, and understand how disturbance intensity affect species co-occurrence. Two study areas were considered: sub-Mediterranean grasslands of Umbria-Marches Apennine (central Italy) and the sub-desertic rangelands of southern Peruvian Andes (Peru). In the studied sub-Mediterranean grasslands the competition for light and soil resources may be extremely intense among species. In fact, competition plays a key role, especially in dense and more productive grasslands, where the co-existence of plants is mainly linked to the competitive exclusion. For this reason, in these plant communities the species co-existence is driven by a specific pattern of functional plant traits that ensures foliage expansion affording a competitive advantage. Furthermore, clonal growth forms and vegetative propagation modes that imply horizontal space occupation, can be interpreted as a strategy aimed at maximizing the species competitive ability when there is higher exploitation of soil resources, allowing individuals to explore the neighbouring areas and find unexploited soil niches. This helps to avoid competition for soil resources with the dominant species. Accordingly, the plant functional composition also affects the competitive ability in relation to the stress and the disturbance intensity. In terms of biodiversity conservation, the research outputs represent an advance in the understanding of the ecological processes involved at plant community level, as well as at landscape scale. Some plant traits may reflect selection by herbivores, while others are likely to be by-products of selection for other ecological functions. Moreover, several plant traits may have a dual role. The study findings allow to highlight a general scheme, in which the stress intensity filters the pool of traits at landscape scale, while the disturbance intensity leads to the distribution, occurrence and abundance of single traits at plant community level. Stress intensity (drought stress) selects the trait composition of the plant community at a landscape scale. Thus, traits and associated plant species are distributed at landscape scale depending on stress intensity. In xeric grassland, stress tolerance and avoidance strategies by hairs and leaf texture, determining low evapotranspiration and low palatability, are widespread. Therophyte and chamaephyte life forms are fostered. In semimesic condition either avoidance mechanisms (rosette form, chemical substances, spines and prostrate form) or tolerance strategies (re-growth capacity) occur, as well as late flowering and <b>tall</b> species (upright <b>forbs,</b> <b>tall</b> tussock grasses). More productive environments develop numerous functional types and a higher floristic richness. Disturbance intensity (number of herbivores), type (mowing or grazing, and the different livestock type) and timing act as driving forces in promoting or suppressing the plant functional traits expression. The pool of traits is filtered in different ways by the system. High intensity of disturbance favours avoidance strategies (i. e. prostrate form, rosette forbs, hairs) and vegetative reproduction (clonal ability). The intermediate disturbance condition leads to the largest pool of traits that allows maximum floristic richness. The co-existence of species is promoted by the co-existence of avoidance and tolerance strategies, due to the possibility to use the maximum number of spatial (micro-scale) and temporal niches (change in sward structure during the growing season). In low intensity of disturbance and abandonment conditions, tolerance strategies and dominant species are promoted; on the contrary, the low statured (rosette and prostrate form), accidental and subordinate species are disadvantaged. Large herbivores like horses cause the increase of short grasses, sedges, rosette forbs and annuals (growth forms with poor root systems). These plants do not ensure the maintenance of soil on steep slopes. Upright <b>forbs,</b> dominant unpalatable <b>tall</b> grasses (Brachypodium rupestre) and chamaephyte species are promoted by selective defoliation of small herbivores like sheep. Facilitative interactions between palatable and unpalatable species were observed. Grazing in springtime negatively affects the early spring flowering species of mid/tall dimensions and relevant species such as orchids. This is an issue for biodiversity conservation. The research findings highlight the strong importance of plantâ€“plant spatial interactions in the Peruvian dry Puna. In this harsh environment many species need some kind of facilitative interaction with nurses (mainly with tall grasses, shrubs or cushion plants). Tall grasses (mainly Festuca orthophylla) are the most important nurse species because they have the highest number of spatially associated plants. Thus, the management of this species should be viewed as a key factor for dry Puna biodiversity conservation. In fact, as camelids prefer the fresh, regrown leaves of F. orthophylla that resprout after burning throughout the Peruvian dry Puna, there is the widespread practice of burning these plant communities to renew forage for livestock. Subsequent to burning, shelter and regenerative niches are probably few and small for some years. Because of this, species with strong spatial relationship with F. orthophylla could be threatened with local extinction, especially in conditions of overgrazing. The effects of combined overgrazing and fire lead to the decrease of tall species F. orthophylla and to an increase of the dwarf and spiny shrub Tetraglochin cristatum. The reduction of nurse cover value leads to the decrease of facilitative interactions and consequently to a reduction of species richness. Thus, inappropriate land use practices (e. g. excessive grazing and uncontrolled fire) are the fundamental causes of land degradation. The abundance of tall grasses and shrubs counters soil erosion by wind, and reduction of their cover value could lead to increased soil loss. This could contribute to desertification more than climatic change, or contribute to a cumulative process that amplifies the impact of climatic change.
