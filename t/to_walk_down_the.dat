500|$|Following {{commercial}} success in Italy, the band did a six-week tour {{there at the}} start of 1972. The band were apprehensive about touring there, concerned they might be playing to half empty venues, but they were all shocked by the sheer volume of the crowds that came to see them. [...] "Pawn Hearts was seen as the ultimate album by the ultimate band," [...] said Jackson, who at times found it difficult <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street in parts of Italy without being recognised. [...] "The tour was like the prophets have landed... you couldn't go anywhere without this lunatic 'Generator Mania' breaking out." [...] After the tour, the group was immediately offered another Italian tour, this time doing up to three shows a day. In between the tours, the band made an appearance on Belgian television performing [...] "Theme One" [...] and [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers". Since the studio recording of [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" [...] was a collage of multiple recordings, impossible to reproduce live in one setting, the band simply filmed individual sections of the song and spliced them together in the editing suite. It was the only live performance of the song until 2013.|$|E

2500|$|S/L Bill Edrich {{had been}} a bomber pilot {{during the war and}} won the DFC in the [...] "RAF's most audacious and {{dangerous}} low-level bombing raid" [...] of 1941. A gutsy batsman he was [...] "almost indifferent to his own safety. No bowler is too fast to hook; no score too large to defy challenge" [...] and stood up to the bouncers of Lindwall and Miller. Returning to England in 1947 he became an amateur and made a record 3,539 runs (80.43) with 12 centuries, a total only exceeded by his Middlesex Twin Denis Compton who made 3,816 runs (90.85) and 18 centuries in the same season. Compton was the golden boy of post-war cricket [...] "illuminating the seemingly impossible stroke and playing shots which are so late that they appear to be afterthoughts." [...] He was restricted by Hammond's orders to stick to the crease as he liked <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> pitch to upset the slow bowlers – relying on his quick eye to keep him out of trouble – and was a shadow of himself until the Fourth Test when he ignored the captain's advice and made two centuries. His most famous stroke was the [...] "Compton Sweep" [...] in which he would pivot and drive the ball to long leg. Many others tried to copy this [...] "backward drive" [...] with fatal results, it was a product of Compton's own genius. Young Joe Hardstaff was the son of Joe Hardstaff of Notts and England and was a noted stylist [...] "all ease and elegance" [...] He had toured Australia in 1936–37, but failed to make a century and his Test career was stunted by the enmity of Gubby Allen. His selection was based on an innings of 205 not out against India in the Lords Test, but he had an otherwise poor season and failed on the tour.|$|E
