25|$|Near Kirkhill outside Stewarton {{are several}} farms having the name 'Kilbride' in their title. Bride - an anglicization of Brìghde, Brìd or Saint Brigid - was {{originally}} the Celtic Goddess {{linked with the}} festival of Imbolc, {{the eve of the}} first of February. She was the goddess of Spring and was associated with healing and sacred wells, therefore <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Carlin or Cailleach.|$|E

The Nandaimon at Tōdai-ji and the Amida Hall at Jōdo-ji are the only extant examples of this style. Originally called , because {{it had nothing to}} do with India it was rechristened by scholar Ōta Hirotarō during the 20th century, and the new term stuck. Ōta derived the name from Chōgen's work, particularly Tōdai-ji's Daibutsuden.|$|E
25|$|During {{the history}} of slavery in the United States, most African Americans styled their hair {{in an attempt to}} mimic the styles of the {{predominantly}} white society in which they lived. Afro-textured hair, characterized by its tight kinks, has been described as being kinky, coarse, cottony, nappy, or woolly. These characteristics represented <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European American standard of beauty, and led to a negative view of kinky hair. As a result, the practice of straightening gained popularity among African Americans.|$|E

25|$|Dews play {{a crucial}} role in <b>the</b> cosmogonic drama <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bundahishn, a Zoroastrian view of {{creation}} completed in the 12th century. In this text, the evil spirit Ahriman (the middle Persian equivalent of Avestan Angra Mainyu) creates his hordes of dews to counter <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> Ormuzd (Avestan Ahura Mazda). This notion is already alluded to in the Vendidad (see Younger Avestan texts above), but only properly developed in the Bundahishn. In particular, Ahriman is seen to create six dews that in Zoroastrian tradition are <b>the</b> <b>antitheses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Amahraspands (Avestan Amesha Spentas).|$|R

Erathis is closely allied to Pelor, Ioun and Moradin, and {{is perhaps the}} only god who is on cordial terms with Asmodeus, since tyranny and dystopia are some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forms that civilization can take. As <b>the</b> goddess <b>of</b> civilization, she is <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> Melora, <b>the</b> embodiment <b>of</b> wilderness.|$|R
25|$|A takkanah is an {{enactment}} which (1) revises {{an ordinance}} {{that no longer}} satisfies {{the requirements of the}} times or circumstances, or which (2), being deduced from a Biblical passage, may be regarded as new. It is, therefore, <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gezerah. Takkanot were framed even in the time of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, those of unknown origin being ascribed to earlier leaders, and they have been promulgated at all subsequent periods of Jewish history. The term is applied also to the institution provided for in the enactment.|$|E
25|$|The {{plethora of}} {{religious}} names {{in this area}} – the Kirkmuirs, Kirkhill, Lady Moss, High Cross, Canaan and the Kilbrides, suggest {{that at some point}} in the distant past a pre-Christian and Christian site was located here. No documentary evidence appears to survive and the earliest record is for Kirkry in 1654, now Kilbride. Bride, Brigit or St. Brigid was originally a Celtic Goddess linked with the festival of Imbolc, the eve of the first of February. She was the goddess of spring and was associated with healing and sacred wells. Interestingly the Carlin Stone at Commoncrags in Dunlop is associated with the 'old winter hag', <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goddess Bride. The name Canaan at Kirkmuir was in use as early as 1779. In 1922 James Martin and Mary Gilmour purchased Gillmill and Canaan from the Cunninghames of Lainshaw.|$|E
25|$|However, Carol II {{himself was}} highly hostile to antisemitism. His lover, Elena Lupescu, was Jewish, as {{were a number}} of his friends in government, and he soon reverted to his {{original}} policies (that is, fiercely opposing the antisemites and fascists), but with a newly violent sting. On February 12, 1938, he used the rising violence between political groups as context to seize absolute power (a move which was tacitly supported by the liberals who had come to view him as a lesser evil in comparison to Codreanu's fascist movement). As an authentic Romanian nationalist (albeit, one who had a view of a Westernized, forcefully industrialized Romania {{at the expense of the}} peasants whom he viewed with disdain; making him completely <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> views of Codreanu), Carol was determined that Romania should not fall into the near-absolute economic and political control that many of its neighbors already had, and moved to theatrical resistance against Nazi ideology.|$|E

Silverman notes a contrast between the snobbish, dandy and reactionary side of Uzanne {{with a penchant for}} forgotten authors of the 17th and 18th centuries, and he, in turn, was an innovative artist and bibliophile, <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antique collectors of the [...] "old guard", formed by bibliophiles—mostly aristocrats—who organised the Société des Bibliophiles François. Uzanne spent his last years in his apartment in Saint-Cloud, where he died on 21 October 1931. His remains were cremated at the crematorium and cemetery Père Lachaise.|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Widmerpool is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in Anthony Powell's novel sequence A Dance to the Music of Time, a 12-volume account of upper-class and bohemian [...] life in Britain between 1920 and 1970. Regarded by critics {{as one of}} the more memorable characters of 20th century fiction, Widmerpool is <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequence's narrator-hero Nicholas Jenkins. Initially presented as a comic, even pathetic figure, he becomes increasingly formidable, powerful and ultimately sinister as the novels progress. [...] He is successful in business, in the army and in politics, and is awarded a life peerage. His only sphere of failure is his relationships with women, exemplified by his disastrous marriage to Pamela Flitton. The sequence ends with Widmerpool's downfall and death, in circumstances arising from his involvement with a New Age-type cult.|$|E

It was completely counter to the shellacked, flashy aesthetic of the 1980s in every way. In disheveled jeans and floral frocks, he softened the tough exterior of the archetypal rebel from the inside out, and set the ball in motion for a radical, millennial idea of androgyny."

500|$|The film is Spielberg's {{third on}} the subject of alien visitation, along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Producer and {{longtime}} collaborator Kathleen Kennedy notes that with War of the Worlds, Spielberg had the opportunity to explore <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters brought to life in E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. [...] "When we first started developing E.T., it was a much edgier, darker story and it actually evolved into something that was more benign. I think that the edgier, darker story has always been somewhere inside him. [...] Now, he's telling that story." [...] Spielberg stated that he just {{thought it would be fun}} to make a [...] "really scary film with really scary aliens", something which he had never done before. Spielberg was intent on telling a contemporary story, with Kennedy stating the story was created as a fantasy, but depicted in a hyper-realistic way.|$|E
500|$|Since its release, [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from journalists and music critics. Journalist Robert Christgau described the pairing of McCartney and Jackson as [...] "Michael's worst idea since [...] "Ben"". Rolling Stone {{stated that the}} song was a [...] "wimpoid MOR [...] ballad" [...] and that McCartney was [...] "tame". Stephen Erlewine of AllMusic noted that the song had a [...] "sweet schmaltz". Jackson's breakdown with [...] the [...] "irrepressibly silly Paul McCartney" [...] was [...] "disarmingly goofy", according to Stylus Magazine. Salon.com later described [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] as a [...] "sappy duet". They concluded that McCartney had become a [...] "wimpy old fart". The song garnered a favourable review from Jackson's biographer, J. Randy Taraborrelli. The writer stated that the song was [...] "cute" [...] but lacked substance.

500|$|The Daibutsu {{style and}} the Zen style emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century. The Daibutsu or Great Buddha style, {{introduced}} by the priest Chogen, was based on Song Dynasty architecture and represented <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wayō style. The Nandaimon at Tōdai-ji and the Amida Hall at Jōdo-ji are the only extant examples of this style. Characteristics of the Zen style are earthen floors, subtly curved pent roofs (mokoshi) and pronouncedly curved main roofs, [...] windows and panelled doors. Examples of this style include Butsuden at Kōzan-ji in Shimonoseki, Shakadō at Zenpuku-in and Octagonal Three-storied Pagoda at Anraku-ji. The three Japanese styles, wayō, Daibutsu and Zen were combined in the Muromachi period giving rise to a conglomerate eclectic style represented by the main hall at Kakurin-ji. By {{the end of the}} Muromachi period (late 16th century), Japanese Buddhist architecture had reached its apogee. Construction methods had been perfected and building types conventionalized. Early pre-modern temples were saved from monotony by elaborate structural details, the use of undulating karahafu gables and monumental size of the buildings. Representative examples for Momoyama (1568–1603) and Edo period (1603–1868) temple architecture are the Karamon at Hōgon-ji and the main hall of Kiyomizu-dera respectively.|$|E

500|$|After {{the success}} of Le Dernier de six, Clouzot was hired {{as the head of}} Continental's screenwriting division. Clouzot began work on his second Steeman adaptation, which he would also direct, titled The Murderer Lives at Number 21. It starred Fresnay and Delair playing the same roles they had {{performed}} in Le Dernier de six. Released in 1942, the film was popular with audiences and critics. Clouzot's next film was Le Corbeau {{based on a true story}} about a woman who sent poison pen letters in France in 1922. Grevin was against Clouzot making this film, stating that topic was [...] "dangerous". Le Corbeau would be the last film that Fresnay and Clouzot would work together on. Clouzot had used all possible means to try to anger the actor during the filming, and after he quarreled with Fresnay's wife, Yvonne Printemps, Fresnay and Clouzot broke off their friendship.Le Corbeau was a great success in France, with nearly 250,000 people having seen it in the first months of its initial release. Le Corbeau was released in 1943 and generated controversy from the right-wing Vichy regime, the left-wing Resistance press and the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church considered the film [...] "painful and hard, constantly morbid in its complexity". The Vichy press dubbed it <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Révolution nationale and demanded it be banned due to its immoral values. The anti-Nazi resistance press considered it Nazi propaganda because of its negative portrayal of the French populace.

There's some darkness to him and there's some danger to him that I think is really interesting and exciting to play. [...] " [...] Additionally, McKidd describes Hunt as [...] "very instinctive, and follows his gut, and he's very impulsive, and very immediate. He immediately assesses a situation. And he's very honest, sometimes painfully honest, with himself and with others. He wants to make himself better. He wants to improve himself as a person. He's a decent guy, {{a sort of a}} guy I'd like to go out and have a beer with." [...] Hunt's unorthodox teaching methods {{have been the subject of}} controversy. McKidd said of this: [...] The look of Owen has been described as hardcore and <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other males on the show. McKidd says it's not just the look of Owen, but the fact that in his profession, he is dealing with life and death everyday. The one distinction he finds between his character and the others is that Owen does not care what other people think of him. When McKidd returned from his first appearance, his character appeared to have been changed.
