5|$|In the present, Black {{realizes that}} the current murderer must be Hance's former cellmate Jacob Tyler (Scott Heindl). Black visits Hance in prison, and upon {{speaking}} to Hance, realizes that Tyler believes himself Hance's reincarnation, aspiring to follow his methods exactly. Meanwhile, Tyler calls the police and leaves an anonymous tip, telling them that <b>the</b> <b>liquor</b> <b>store</b> murderer is hiding in an abandoned building. Black accompanies a SWAT team encircling the building, but the officers come under sniper fire from a construction site across the street. Black and Bletcher separate as they search for Tyler, who gets the drop on Black. Black disarms Tyler, attempting to talk him into surrendering. Tyler empties a handgun at Black, but misses; when Bletcher confronts him, Tyler points the gun and Bletcher instinctively shoots and kills him.|$|E

25|$|Some {{locations}} have liquor stores, often kept {{separate from}} the main warehouse in order to comply with liquor license restrictions. In some states (such as Texas), <b>the</b> <b>liquor</b> <b>store</b> must be {{owned and operated by}} a separate company with separate employees. In 2006, Costco lost a lawsuit against the state of Washington in which it was seeking to purchase wine directly from the producer, bypassing the state retail monopoly. In Australia, Costco has to comply with regulations set by each state they choose trade in; their first store in the state of Victoria benefits from some of the most liberal alcohol licensing laws in the country, with retailers permitted to sell alcohol on shelves within the store, {{in a manner similar to}} most European countries. In the Canadian province of Quebec, beer and wine are sold within the stores from pallets.|$|E

500|$|Jarmusch had met blues singer Screamin' Jay Hawkins [...] after {{featuring}} {{his music}} prominently in his breakthrough feature film debut Stranger Than Paradise (1984). Although reticent about acting, Hawkins responded favorably to the director's offer to appear. The part of Luisa was also {{written by the}} director with the star – actress Nicoletta Braschi – in mind; the two had previously collaborated on Down by Law (1986). Cinqué Lee is the younger brother of director Spike Lee, {{a longtime friend of}} Jarmusch from their days at New York University's film school, while Youki Kudoh was cast after the director saw her performance in Sōgo Ishii's The Crazy Family (1984) while promoting Down by Law in Japan. Repeat Jarmusch collaborators who worked on the film included John Lurie who provided the original music, cinematographer Robby Müller, and singer Tom Waits, who in a voice appearance reprised his role of radio DJ Lee Baby Sims from Down by Law.

500|$|... "Liquor Store Blues" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews by most music critics. Tyrone S. Reid, {{considered the}} song {{one of the}} best in the album, [...] "You simply can’t get lyrics more droll or brainer than that." [...] The addition of Damien Marley made the track [...] "more alluring". DJ Gravy praised the fact that the song [...] "has a more authentic yard vibe, thanks to Black Chiney's Supa Dups", when comparing it to Mars and Travis McCoy's [...] "Billionaire". Slant Magazines Eric Henderson panned the song as [...] "sway gently with a hint of reggae swagger". Kevin Barber from the Consequence of Sound, who positively reviewed the album, wrote [...] "In return for all of his generous favors he has given other artists, they give back as well. Damien Marley joins him on the reggae jam". Idolator's writer Robbie Daw had a mixed opinion towards the song by writing that the recording [...] "isn’t nearly as infectious as [...] "Just The Way You Are", [...] it should still make for a fairly decent album track in what we’re hoping is a tasty plateful of catchy future singles". He found the tune to be [...] "reggae-tinged jam". Scott Mervis of Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that [...] "Liquor Store Blues" [...] was in a [...] "heavier dub zone with toaster Damian Marley" [...] furthering a personal matter [...] "the young singer should have stuck to <b>the</b> <b>liquor</b> <b>store</b> 'cause he was busted for cocaine in Vegas last month". Andrew Winistorfer of Prefix Magazine criticized the artist, saying [...] "After conquering the ladies who love weak pop music that is sung by a competent if boring singer, Bruno Mars has decided to try to carve off a chunk of Sublime's fans". He concluded by deeming the recording a [...] "faux reggae track". A writer for Rap-Up magazine commented that the recording's lyrics regard [...] "a quick escape from his bad fortune in an odd foreshadowing of events". Similarly, while reviewing the music video, Entertainment Weeklys, Brad Wete stated that the content of the lyrics saying [...] "Mars aims to [...] "get messed up today" [...] in hopes that he’ll [...] "be okay tomorrow"".|$|E

[...] That program had its start at the first site of the Museum over <b>the</b> <b>liquor</b> <b>store</b> on Fifth Avenue (2033 Fifth Avenue). [...] It was a loft, a factory {{going out of business}} that had a lot of sewing machines in it. [...] Mel Edwards and I physically cleaned that space out for the Artist-in-Residence program.

2500|$|Jones' binge {{drinking}} {{and use of}} amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 {{and he had to}} be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. [...] Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. [...] Perhaps the most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. [...] Jones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars they owned before leaving. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. [...] Upset, Jones walked to the window and looked out over his property. [...] He later described his thoughts in his memoir: [...] "There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken {{an hour and a half}} or more for me to get to <b>the</b> <b>liquor</b> <b>store,</b> but get there I did." [...] Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for [...] "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" [...] by Hank Williams Jr.. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for [...] "One More Last Chance" [...] by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single [...] "Honky Tonk Song" [...] in 1996. Curiously, in her 1979 autobiography Stand By Your Man, Tammy Wynette claims the incident occurred while she was married to Jones, maintaining that she woke up at one o'clock in the morning to find her husband gone: [...] "I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away. When I pulled into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway. [...] He looked up and saw me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.’" ...|$|E

6000|$|Crinkett listened very patiently, still {{maintaining}} {{his position}} on his own side of the gate. Then he spoke words of such wisdom as was in him. 'Ahalala is just the place to ease you of a little money. Mind I tell you. Gold! of course there's been gold to be got there. But what's been the cost of it? What's been the return? If sixteen hundred men, among 'em, can sell fifteen hundred pounds' worth of gold a week, how is each man to have twenty shillings on Saturday night? That's {{about what it is}} at Ahalala. Of course there's gold. And where there's gold chucked about in that way, just on the surface, one gets it and ten don't. Who is to say you mayn't be the one. As to hiring a man to show you the way,--you can hire a dozen. As long as you'll pay 'em ten shillings a-day to loaf about, you may have men enough. But whether they'll show you the way to anything except <b>the</b> <b>liquor</b> <b>store,</b> that's another thing. Now shall I tell you what you two gents had better do?' Dick declared that the two gents would be very much obliged to him if he would take that trouble. 'Of course you've heard of the [...] "Old Stick-in-the-Mud"?' Dick told him that they had heard of that very successful mining enterprise since their arrival at Nobble. 'You ask on the veranda at Melbourne, or at Ballarat, or at Sydney. If they don't tell you about it, my name's not Crinkett. You put your money, what you've got, into ten-shilling shares. I'll accommodate you, as you're friends of Jones, with any reasonable number. We're getting two ounces to the ton. The books'll show you that.' ...|$|E
