2500|$|The 1994 and 1995 seasons {{established}} Kenseth as a short track star. Kenseth made a {{name for}} himself while driving at several Wisconsin tracks, beating nationally known drivers such as Dick Trickle and Robbie Reiser. He raced 60 times in three different cars in 1994, winning track championships at both Wisconsin International Raceway (WIR) on Thursday nights and Madison on Friday nights. Kenseth competed against Reiser at Madison, and won 12 of 17 features at the track. He won the 1994 Slinger Nationals at Slinger Super Speedway. In 1995, he repeated with back-to-back championships at Madison and WIR, plus he won the Red, White, and Blue state championship series at WIR on three Saturday nights.

Existing Bank of England banknotes in higher denominations continued to circulate alongside the Treasury Notes. In 1963 production of postage stamps passed to the General Post Office.|$|R

They are multimedia installations that blur the boundary between the tangible and the transcendental.The nostalgia of harmony, the rejection of subjectivism, and liturgies of everyday life as an expression of moral integrity, are his cross-cutting themes.His work is present in public and private collections nationally and internationally.|$|R

50|$|Cain's polling numbers {{declined}} in November 2011 amidst allegations of past sexual misconduct with female employees.

In mid-November, a poll by The Washington Post and ABC showed a 19% increase in Republicans who hold a negative impression of Cain.

40|$|How do firms {{respond to}} {{technological}} advances that facilitate the automation of tasks? Which tasks will they automate, and {{what types of}} worker will be replaced as a result? We present a model that distinguishes between a task's engineering complexity and its training requirements. When two tasks are equally complex, firms will automate the task that requires more training and in which labor is hence more expensive. Under quite general conditions this leads to job polarization, a decline in middle wage jobs relative to both high and low wage jobs. Our theory explains recent and historical instances of job polarization as caused by labor-replacing technologies, such as computers, the electric motor, and the steam engine, respectively. The model makes novel predictions regarding occupational training requirements, which we find <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consistent <b>with</b> <b>US</b> data...|$|R
