40|$|Diffusion {{of heavy}} noble gas atoms in {{irradiation}} damaged single crystalline silicon carbide and the <b>thermal</b> <b>etching</b> {{of it is}} investigated at temperatures of 1300 C and 1400 C. For this purpose 360 keV krypton and xenon ions were implanted in commercial 6 H-SiC wafers at 600 C, which is far above the critical amorphization temperature of the target material. Width broadening of the implantation profiles and the retention of krypton and xenon during isothermal annealing was determined by RBS-analysis, whilst damage profiles were simultaneously obtained by a-particle channelling. No diffusion and no loss of the implanted species is detected in the implanted samples after isothermal annealing for 40 h at 1400 C. However, <b>thermal</b> <b>etching</b> of the target material is observed at both annealing temperatures and leads at 1400 C to a significant shift of the implantation profile towards the surface due to sublimation. RBS analysis shows that this occurs mainly during the initial stage of isothermal annealing, while surface loss during prolonged annealing is minimal. The resulting topographical modification of the surface during annealing was studied by scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. It indicates that the observed phenomenon {{is due to a}} relatively strong dependence of <b>thermal</b> <b>etching</b> on the defect density in the surface region, while the evolving surface roughness seems not to play a decisive role.
