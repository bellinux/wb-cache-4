25|$|University Park (UPK) is {{a complex}} of two story {{buildings}} that include 40 studio, 86 one-bedroom, and 80 two-bedroom unfurnished apartments. UPK is located near the URMC, directly across from Southside off of Kendrick Road. Graduate students and <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> the primary occupants of these apartments, but some non-traditional undergraduate students are housed here who have been deemed too old for traditional undergraduate housing on the River Campus. Students who live here typically take up residence year round.|$|E

25|$|This war is {{notorious for}} the British {{scorched}} earth policy, which was implemented {{when it became}} clear that the guerrilla tactics practiced by the republican Boer forces could not be overcome by conventional means. In 1901, Emily Hobhouse reported on the genocide which was taking place in the 45 British concentration camps for Boer women, children and elderly in which, over an 18-month period, 26,370 people would die, 24,000 of them boys and girls under 16. Exact mortality figures in the 64 concentration camps for black displaced farm workers and <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> not known, but was probably even worse.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the church}} had a paid local clergy in the 1800s, local and {{regional}} priesthood leaders currently serve as volunteers. Non-clerical church employees, general authorities (who serve life or five-year terms), and mission presidents are paid a stipend from church funds and provided other benefits. A general missionary fund covers the basic living expenses of single Mormon missionaries. Missionaries and <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> asked to contribute to this fund, and in the United States the missionary's congregation of origin is ultimately responsible to satisfy the monthly obligation to the general fund. Members volunteer general custodial work for local church facilities.|$|E
25|$|The Svans, the {{indigenous}} population of Svanetia, are ethnic subgroup of the Georgians. Until the 1930s, Mingrelians and Svans had their own census grouping, but were classified under the broader category of Georgian thereafter. They are Georgian Orthodox Christians, and were Christianized in the 4th-6th centuries. However, some remnants of old paganism have been maintained. Saint George (known as Jgëræg to the locals), a patron saint of Georgia, is the most respected saint. The Svans have retained many of their old traditions, including blood revenge. <b>Their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> small, and the husband {{is the head of}} his family. The Svan really respect the older women in families.|$|E

25|$|Management {{decisions}} {{are more difficult}} for a moderately or severely undervirilized genetic male whose testes are in the abdomen and whose genitalia look {{at least as much}} female as male. Male sex can assigned and major reconstructive surgery done to close the midline of the perineum and move the testes into a constructed scrotum. Female sex can be assigned and the testes removed and vagina enlarged surgically. A recently advocated third choice would be to assign either sex and defer surgery to adolescence. Each approach carries its own disadvantages and risks. Children and <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> different enough that none of the courses is appropriate for all.|$|E
25|$|In the present, Duke {{splinters}} {{from the}} others when his parents Max and Connie are captured. During that time, he did have some problems with his brother Vince who was shown displeased with what happened at Cobra Pharmaceuticals and stated that their parents are in doubt about what happened. After Duke saves his parents and reunites with the other Joes, they arrive at the Hauser household where Connie wanted to treat them to a meal. Unfortunately, Vince had called Flint after he had warned Duke to stay away. Duke ends up defending his actions towards the other Joes and tells Flint upon the group's arrest to see that <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> protected.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Congress {{took up the}} reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which {{provides}} health care for about 6 million children and 670,000 adults from families who earn too much money to qualify for Medicare {{but not enough to}} afford health insurance. Congressional Democrats and many Republicans tried to expand the coverage of the program to other needy families, but they were opposed by President George W. Bush and other Republicans. In 2006, 5.4 million children were eligible but not enrolled in SCHIP or Medicaid, and 9.4 million total children were uninsured. Such children and <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> often treated in emergency rooms of hospitals, a much more expensive alternative for taxpayers than expanding the SCHIP and similar programs.|$|E

40|$|In the {{following}} project we concern ourselves {{with a group}} of danish volunteers who fought in the Waffen SS during WWII, how they and <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>were</b> met with defiance in danish society, and more importantly why? Approximately 6000 danes actively fought for the german army. By joining ranks with Waffen SS and thereby the Nazi cause, they isolated themselves from society. They had crossed a line, and were consequently labelled as traitors by large segments of the danish population. The gradual stigmatisation that followed did not only affect the volunteers, but also <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> The volunteers and <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>were</b> {{on the wrong side of}} the line that seperated the danish population from the german occupying force. By analysing police reports that deal with the relationship between the german occupying force (including the danish volunteers) and danish civilians, we give an account of the defiance the volunteers and <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>were</b> subjected to. Furthermore, we show how the sense of a national togetherness that became increasingly present during the war, and specific events that took place during the occupation, were the main sources of the defiance and stigmatisation, the volunteers and <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>were</b> subjected to...|$|R
25|$|Jacob and {{his sons}} are forced by famine to go down into Egypt, {{although}} Joseph was already there, {{as he had been}} sold into slavery while young. When they arrive they and <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> 70 in number, but within four generations they have increased to 600,000 men of fighting age, and the Pharaoh of Egypt, alarmed, first enslaves them and then orders the death of all male Hebrew children. A woman from the tribe of Levi hides her child, places him in a woven basket, and sends him down the Nile river. He is named Mosheh, or Moses, by the Egyptians who find him. Being a Hebrew baby, they award a Hebrew woman the task of raising him, the mother of Moses volunteers, and the child and his mother are reunited.|$|E
25|$|For dead donors, {{the process}} begins with verifying {{that the person}} is hopelessly dead, {{determining}} whether any organs could be donated, and obtaining consent for the donation of any usable organs. Normally, nothing is done until the person has already died, although if death is inevitable, it is possible to check for consent and to do some simple medical tests shortly beforehand, to help find a matching recipient. The verification of death is normally done by a neurologist (a physician specializing in brain function) that is not involved in the previous attempts to save the patient's life. This physician {{has nothing to do with}} the transplantation process. Verification of death is often done multiple times, to prevent doctors from overlooking any remaining sign of life, however small. After death, the hospital may keep the body on a mechanical ventilator and use other methods to keep the organs in good condition. Donors and <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> not charged for any expenses related to the donation.|$|E
25|$|Most of Tajikistan's {{environmental}} problems {{are related to}} the agricultural policies imposed on the country during the Soviet period. By 1991 heavy use of mineral fertilizers and agricultural chemicals was a major cause of pollution in the republic. Among those chemicals were DDT, banned by international convention, and several defoliants and herbicides. In addition to the damage they have done to the air, land, and water, the chemicals have contaminated the cottonseeds whose oil is used widely for cooking. Cotton farmers and <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> at particular risk from the overuse of agricultural chemicals, both from direct physical contact in the field and from the use of the branches of cotton plants at home for fuel. All of these toxic sources are believed to contribute to a high incidence of maternal and child mortality and birth defects. In 1994 the infant mortality rate was 43.2 per 1,000 births, the second highest rate among former Soviet republics. The rate in 1990 had been 40.0 infant deaths per 1,000 births.|$|E

25|$|Political prisoners: Political {{prisons are}} the harshest {{long-term}} punishment {{that can be}} inflicted to an individual in the DPRK, and are used as the means to remove from society those individuals and families that are seen as an irredeemable threat to the regime. As such, these inmates cease to be considered citizens with any rights. Persons accused of major political crimes become victims of enforced disappearance; they are detained and, if not executed immediately, brought without trial to political prison camps (kwanliso) and held incommunicado. <b>Their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> never informed of their fate. The State uses this system to instill fear in the population. The inmate population has been gradually eliminated through deliberate starvation, forced labor, executions, torture, rape and the denial of reproductive rights. The Commission estimates that {{hundreds of thousands of}} political prisoners have perished in these camps over the past five decades, with atrocities that resemble the horrors of camps that totalitarian states established during the twentieth century. Between 80,000 and 120,000 people are believed to remain incarcerated. The DPRK has always denied the existence of this prison network.|$|E
25|$|When the men {{return to}} the village with the {{collected}} trash, usually <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> waiting for {{them so that they}} can begin sorting the trash. The majority of those who sort the trash are women, while certain families specialize in sorting certain materials such as paper, plastic, aluminum, glass, etc. The women and children sort the garbage into 16 different types of trash and sort out the recyclables. The sorting of garbage is a time-consuming task in which women and children may spend up to 10 to 12 hours each day separating the garbage. First, the trash is sorted into the main 16 categories, such as paper, plastic, cardboard, cans, etc. So for example, all different types of paper are placed into one pile while all different types of plastic are placed in another pile. Sorting within categories does not take place until after the trash is sorted first into the major categories. Then sorting within the category takes place. For instance, the major category of paper would be sorted into white paper, yellow paper, thick paper, newspaper, thin paper, etc. Each sub-sorted material is then sold to factories and middle-men for a marginal profit.|$|E
25|$|Most major {{classes of}} predatory and {{parasitic}} arthropods contain species that eat pollen, despite the common perception that bees {{are the primary}} pollen-consuming arthropod group. Many other Hymenoptera other than bees consume pollen as adults, though {{only a small number}} feed on pollen as larvae (including some ant larvae). Spiders are normally considered carnivores but pollen is an important source of food for several species, particularly for spiderlings, which catch pollen on their webs. It is not clear how spiderlings manage to eat pollen however, since their mouths are not large enough to consume pollen grains. Some predatory mites also feed on pollen, with some species being able to subsist solely on pollen, such as Euseius tularensis, which feeds on the pollen of dozens of plant species. Members of some beetle families such as Mordellidae and Melyridae feed almost exclusively on pollen as adults, while various lineages within larger families such as Curculionidae, Chrysomelidae, Cerambycidae, and Scarabaeidae are pollen specialists even though most members of <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> not (e.g., only 36 of 40000 species of ground beetles, which are typically predatory, have been shown to eat pollen—but this is thought to be a severe underestimate as the feeding habits are only known for 1000 species). Similarly, Ladybird beetles mainly eat insects, but many species also eat pollen, as either part or all of their diet. Hemiptera are mostly herbivores or omnivores but pollen feeding is known (and has only been well studied in the Anthocoridae). Many adult flies, especially Syrphidae, feed on pollen, and three UK syrphid species feed strictly on pollen (syrphids, like all flies, cannot eat pollen directly due to the structure of their mouthparts, but can consume pollen contents that are dissolved in a fluid). Some species of fungus, including Fomes fomentarius, are able to break down grains of pollen as a secondary nutrition source that is particularly high in nitrogen. Pollen may be valuable diet supplement for detritivores, providing them with nutrients needed for growth, development and maturation. It was suggested that obtaining nutrients from pollen, deposited on the forest floor during periods of pollen rains, allows fungi to decompose nutritionally scarce litter.|$|E
