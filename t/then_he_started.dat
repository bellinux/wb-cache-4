5|$|After the war, {{he started}} selling {{bicycles}} and motorbikes {{in a small}} shop in Brunswick Street, in the Kensington Fields area of Liverpool. He began selling and recharging batteries in 1925, opening a shop {{in the front room}} of his family's three-storey Georgian terraced house, called Phillips’ Battery Charging Depot, and had to install large accumulators in the cellar. Phillips ran the business for 30 years, even during WWII, but due to a decline in demand for batteries in the early 1950s (most people having electricity by <b>then)</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> selling household electrical goods. By late 1954, the shop was only selling records and record players; customers would buy recordings of American Country and Western, and Big Band music. As Phillips had supplied batteries to the Burtonwood air base during the war, he could buy and sell the latest records from America via his contacts there.|$|E

Andrée was an {{engineer}} originally from Gothenburg, Sweden, and lived {{for a few years}} in USA before moving to Turku 1898. First he had worked for Turun Rauta-teollisuus Oy until 1905 and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> selling boat engines in department store Wiklund. He was particularly interested in boats and engines. He bought the boat department with his brother-in-law, Gustaf Allan Rosenqvist, in 1906. Rosenqvist, born in Turku, was then just 21-year-old and he had a business degree.|$|E

25|$|In his twenty-fourth year, Muthukutty {{was struck}} by illness and {{suffered}} for a year. His mother took her sick son to the temple at Thiruchendur, during a festival there. He went into the sea and disappeared. The parents searched for his body for one day. According to legend, on the third day, Lord Vishnu appeared on the sea-shore. On seeing him, Muthukutty's mother mistook him for her son and tried to embrace him. He {{told her that he}} was no longer her son, but the son of Supreme Lord Narayana. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> walking towards Detchanam. This place became a holy place for the devotees of Ayyavazhi and they erected a temple there named Avatharappathi. This event is celebrated during the festival of Ayya Vaikundar Avataram.|$|E
25|$|Tilney {{occupied}} {{this position}} as it underwent {{a significant change}} in focus. When he began his work, it consisted principally of planning and conducting royal entertainments, as a unit of the Lord Chamberlain's office. His principal aim was that of pleasing the Queen. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> clearing up the various problems associated with the Revels office. It had fallen into major disrepute with creditors. A commission issued on 24 December 1581 solved this financial crisis and enabled him to reduce the maintenance costs of the office to a moderate budget. The second section of the commission was to prohibit the discussion of any controversial issues in theatre. A play would be permitted only if the manuscript had the signature of the Master. Any offender could be imprisoned by Tilney's orders. He was given complete authority in matters concerning drama. This responsibility had been previously shared by Revels officers.|$|E
25|$|In the {{elections}} held on 5 July 1928, Venizelos' party regained power {{and forced the}} government to hold new elections on 19 August of the same year; this time his party won 228 out of 250 places in Parliament. During this period Venizelos attempted to end Greece's diplomatic isolation by restoring normal relations with the country's neighbors. His efforts proved {{to be successful in}} the cases of the newly founded Kingdom of Yugoslavia and Italy. Firstly Venizelos signed an agreement on 23 September 1928 with Benito Mussolini in Rome, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> negotiations with Yugoslavia which resulted in a Treaty of Friendship signed on 27 March 1929. An additional protocol settled the status of the Yugoslav free trade zone of Thessaloniki in a way favorable to Greek interests. Nevertheless, despite the co-ordinated British efforts under Arthur Henderson in 1930–1931, full reconciliation with Bulgaria was never achieved during his premiership. Venizelos was also cautious towards Albania, and although bilateral relations remained at a good level, no initiative was taken by either side aiming at the final settlement of the unresolved issues (mainly related with the status of the Greek minority of South Albania).|$|E

500|$|Churchill {{described}} his life at Chartwell {{in the later}} 1930s in {{the first volume of}} his history of the Second World War, The Gathering Storm. [...] "I had much to amuse me. I built... two cottages,... and walls and made... a large swimming pool which... could be heated to supplement our fickle sunshine. Thus I... dwelt at peace within my habitation". Bill Deakin, one of Churchill's research assistants, recalled his working routine. [...] "He would start the day at eight o'clock in bed, reading. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> with his mail. His lunchtime conversation was quite magnificent,...absolutely free for all. After lunch, if he had guests he would take them round the garden. At seven he would bathe and change for dinner. At midnight, when the guests left, then he would start work... to three or four in the morning. The secret was his phenomenal power to concentrate." ...|$|E

[...] Although neither the Kinks nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, at the time it was widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. It has been reported that an incident when the band were taping Dick Clark's TV show Where The Action Is in 1965 led to the ban. Ray Davies recalls in his autobiography, [...] "Some guy who said he worked for the TV company walked up and accused us of being late. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> making anti-British comments. Things like 'Just because the Beatles did it, every mop-topped, spotty-faced limey juvenile thinks he can come over here and make a career for himself."

2500|$|McLuhan was {{credited}} with coining the phrase Turn on, tune in, drop out by its popularizer, Timothy Leary, in the 1960s. In a 1988 interview with Neil Strauss, Leary stated that slogan was [...] "given to him" [...] by McLuhan during a lunch in New York City. Leary said McLuhan [...] "was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, 'Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that’s a lot,' {{to the tune of}} a Pepsi commercial. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> going, 'Tune in, turn on, and drop out.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1946 {{he tried}} to make The Midsummer Night's Dream but {{abandoned}} the project due to financial problems. Next year, he made Zanzabelle a Paris adapted from a story by Sonika Bo. In 1949, he met Alexandre Kamnka (Alkam Films), an old Russian friend, who produced Starewitch's first colour film Fleur de fougère (Fern Flower). It's based on an Eastern European story, in which a child goes to the forest to collect a fern flower, which grows during the night of Saint-Jean, and which makes wishes come true. In 1950, Fern Flower won the first prize as an animated film in the 11th International Children Film Festival in Venice Biennale. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> a collaboration with Sonika Bo to adapt another of her stories, [...] "Gazouilly petit oiseau", followed by [...] "Un dimanche de Gazouillis" [...] (Gazouillis's Sunday picnic).|$|E
2500|$|According to Lords, she and {{her sister}} Lorraine both {{developed}} early; this fueled their father's concerns about their sexuality. [...] "I think my father hated women. He dealt with us until we were eleven, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> to lay this guilt on us about sex." [...] At the age of ten, Lords was raped by a sixteen-year-old boy who she had befriended at her friend's birthday party. When she was twelve, Lords moved with her mother and sisters to Lawndale, California, along with her mother's new boyfriend. It was the last time she saw her father. In September 1982, she began attending the Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California. During her early school years, Lords developed a rebellious attitude. She was angry at her mother, blaming her for their poverty, and found a father figure in her mother's boyfriend. Roger Hayes, as she calls him in her , was a cocaine dealer and molested Lords in her sleep. After her mother broke up with him due to his drug use, she began dating his friend. Lords refused to follow them to a new place and was left with her older sister Lorraine. Her mother and two younger sisters eventually ended up in a women's shelter until her mother was able to find a new apartment.|$|E

2500|$|William Horace (Bill) Temple (28 November 1898 – [...] 9 April 1988), nicknamed [...] "Temperance Bill" [...] or [...] "Temperance Willie", [...] was a Canadian {{democratic}} socialist politician, {{trade union}} activist, businessman and temperance crusader. As a youth {{he worked for}} the railway. During World War I, and World War II he was a soldier in the [...] Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Canadian Air Force. Between the wars, he was a salesman, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> a clothing import business. He became a socialist during this period, and joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) when it was formed. He ran for political office many times for the CCF, both federally and provincially. The highlight of his political career was in 1948, when he defeated the incumbent premier of Ontario George Drew in his own legislative seat, in the electoral district of High Park, even though the premier's party won [...] the general election with a majority government. His tenure was relatively short, serving only one term, and was defeated in the 1951 provincial election, and went back into the clothing import business. In his later years, he successfully led the political fight to maintain the prohibition on selling alcohol in a section of Toronto's west end, winning three referenda in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. He died in the spring of 1988, a few months before another referendum on lifting the restrictions on alcohol in the area was again defeated, his [...] "last" [...] victory.|$|E
2500|$|Nearly {{two years}} later, Carey was named referee of Super Bowl XLII. On working the NFL's {{championship}} game, Carey {{said it was}} a [...] "personal honor" [...] and understood the historical significance of being the first African American referee. On the significance of the event, he {{said it was a}} [...] "great sign of the evolution of our society that all barriers are eroding". During the fourth quarter, Carey's judgment was a factor in one of the important plays of the game. On third down, with just over a minute left in regulation, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning received the snap in a shotgun formation and looked to pass the ball. New England Patriots defenders Richard Seymour, Jarvis Green, and Adalius Thomas grabbed and attempted to tackle Manning. Manning escaped the two defenders and threw a 32-yard pass to wide receiver David Tyree. Under NFL rules, officials are required to stop play when a player is [...] "in the grasp and control" [...] of the defense. Carey determined that [...] "grasp and control" [...] was never achieved since Manning's forward momentum did not stop. Speaking about the play, Carey said, [...] "I anticipated a sack. I didn't assume that was going to happen, but rarely do you see a quarterback escape when he's got that much weight on his back and being dragged by two or three guys who had a hold of him. I could see [...] head was just straight ahead. He was trying to break free with desperation. Then all of a sudden he spun out and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> to come right back at me." ...|$|E
