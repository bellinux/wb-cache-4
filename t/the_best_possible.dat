5|$|Typical to {{variations}} of the Irenaean theodicy {{is the notion that}} the present world is the greatest possible world, or {{the best of all possible}} worlds. This is based on the Irenaean idea of human development, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>possible</b> world would be best suited to human development: a world containing evil and suffering would allow development better than one which does not, so the world is considered <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>possible</b> world.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, Richard Bellman {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a database to solve chess and checkers endgames using retrograde analysis. Instead of analyzing forward from the position currently on the board, the database would analyze backward from positions where one player was checkmated or stalemated. Thus, a chess computer would no longer need to analyze endgame positions during the game because they were solved beforehand. It would no longer make mistakes because the tablebase always played <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>possible</b> move.|$|E

On the other hand, human input is still required to pick <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>possible</b> forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involve many disciplines such as pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases.|$|E

5|$|Before {{entering}} a stage, the player {{begins in the}} Attraction Information Center, which acts as a hub world. Here, the player can choose a partner and a level to enter, and see which attractions they have already completed. Bonus levels are hidden throughout the zones and can also be triggered by finishing a zone with 20 or more rings. In the bonus levels, the player is free falling and can pick up power-ups as they proceed. Special stages can be entered if finishing a zone with 50 or more rings. In these, the player must collect blue spheres in a forward-scrolling platformer; players are rewarded with a Chaos Ring upon completion. Collecting all Chaos Rings rewards the player with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>possible</b> ending, in which Sonic and Tails make cameo appearances.|$|E
5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks were making <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>possible</b> {{use of their}} forces. As {{long as they could}} prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they had no need to seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor. Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place for very long. The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.|$|E
5|$|In early 1948, Nick Shoemaker, Wiescamp's senior {{stallion}} and Skipper W's sire, {{died in a}} freak accident {{while in}} his paddock, by slipping on some ice and breaking his neck against a fence. This meant that Skipper W's show career was cut short so that he could replace his sire as the main breeding stallion. During his entire career, Skipper W never was bred to any mare that was not owned by Wiescamp. Wiescamp {{wanted to make sure that}} the mares that he bred his stallions to were <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>possible</b> matches for the particular stallion. From the time of Nick Shoemaker's death until Skipper W's own death, the horse remained Wiescamp's senior stallion.|$|E

5|$|In sum number place (Samunampure), {{the regions}} are of {{irregular}} shape and various sizes. The usual constraints of no repeated value in any row, column or region apply. The clues are given as sums of values within regions (e.g. a 4-cell region with sum 10 must consist of values 1,2,3,4 in some order). The {{minimum number of}} clues for Samunampure is not known, nor even conjectured. A variant on Miyuki Misawa's web site replaces sums with relations: the clues are symbols =, < and > showing the relative values of (some but not all) adjacent region sums. She demonstrates an example with only eight relations. It is not known whether this is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 25 October 2007, {{a project}} started {{that had the}} intent to replace all Westland Sea King search and rescue {{helicopters}} with new rescue helicopters by 2020. On 19 December 2013, a contract was signed between AgustaWestland and the government, {{for the purchase of}} 16 AW101 helicopters. The agreement came about after fierce competition between different manufacturers to satisfy the Norwegian requirements. Participants were AgustaWestland, Eurocopter, NHIndustries, Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and Boeing. The government considered that AgustaWestland AW101 met the requirements and specifications in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>possible</b> way.|$|E

After the Star class {{was removed from the}} Olympic sailing disciplines, Simpson {{turned his attention to the}} America's Cup, moving to San Francisco to train in March 2013. He was known for his athleticism, and for his attention to detail in preparing the boat to obtain <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>possible</b> performance.|$|E
