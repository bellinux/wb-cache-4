Pitcher Hugh Kemp set the career franchise records for games started (73) and walks (207) while playing for the team from 1987 to 1989. <b>The</b> <b>Sounds</b> returned in 1990 to experience their most successful season in the American Association, when they compiled an 86–61 record under manager Pete Mackanin. Ending the regular season in a tie with the Buffalo Bisons, <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> won the Eastern Division championship in a one-game playoff. The extra-inning affair was ended by Chris Jones' two-run homer {{in the top of}} the eighteenth inning. <b>The</b> <b>Sounds</b> advanced to their first American Association championship series, where they lost to the Omaha Royals, three games to two. Left-hander Chris Hammond won the league's Most Valuable Pitcher Award for 1990, having led the league with 15wins and 149strikeouts. That year, Nashville set their all-time attendance record when a total of 605,122fans came out to Greer Stadium. Skeeter Barnes, who played with Nashville in 1979 and from 1988 to 1990, holds three career franchise records: games played (514), at bats (1,848), and hits (517).|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the team's {{first season}} as a Pirates affiliate, <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> {{finished}} last in the American Conference East Division with a 67–76 record. <b>The</b> <b>Sounds</b> were led by manager Trent Jewett who {{would go on to}} win 320games from 1998 to 2000 and 2003 to 2004, placing him first on the all-time wins list for Sounds managers. <b>The</b> <b>Sounds</b> experienced their longest winning streak in franchise history when they won 15consecutive games from June 2 to June 20, 1999. Overall, the team improved from the previous year, putting together an 80–60 record, but their second-place finish left them out of the PCL playoffs where only division winners advance to the postseason.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, PCL Manager of the Year Steve Scarsone led <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> to a league-best 83–59 {{record and}} the American Conference Southern Division title, sending the team to the postseason {{for the first time}} since 2007. <b>The</b> <b>Sounds</b> lost the American Conference series versus the Oklahoma City Dodgers, three games to two, {{including}} a dramatic back-and-forth game seven. At First Tennessee Park, <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> added the Country Legends Race, similar to major league mascot races, such as the Sausage Race and Presidents Race, to its between-innings entertainment in 2016. In the middle of the fifth inning, people in oversized foam caricature costumes depicting country musicians Johnny Cash, George Jones, and Reba McEntire race around the warning track from center field, through the visiting bullpen, and to the home plate side of the first base dugout.|$|E

With one stationary microphone array, {{it is hard to}} estimate <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> source position. However, the home service robot can move around, which makes it possible to use triangulation to localize <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> source. Figure  4 shows an example of using triangulation to estimate the positions of two <b>sound</b> sources. If <b>the</b> robot can measure <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> direction at two different positions on the 2 D map, <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> position can be estimated by calculating the intersection of two lines pointing to <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> sources from <b>the</b> robot positions. This method may create a undesired intersection point like point P as shown in Fig.  4. However, this point moves when the robot measures at another position. Therefore, it can be eliminated given the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> sources are stationary. With multiple steps, the robot can improve the accuracy of position estimation using the RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm [29]. <b>The</b> <b>sound</b> source position estimation algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1.|$|R
5|$|In {{their first}} year with the White Sox, <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> {{clinched}} the Eastern Division title with an 81–62 record. In the league championship series, <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> lost to the Iowa Cubs, four games to three, in a decisive extra-inning game seven. Nashville's Rick Renick, who managed the club from 1993 to 1996, was named the American Association Manager of the Year in his first season.|$|E
5|$|Nashville {{ended the}} 2000 {{season with a}} 63–79 record, {{resulting}} in a last-place finish in the divisional standings. Richie Hebner, the Sounds' pitching coach, replaced Trent Jewett as manager when he became the Pirates' third base coach on June 6. Former All-Star Sounds infielder Marty Brown returned to the club to serve as its 25th manager in 2001, becoming the third former Nashville player {{to serve as the}} team's skipper. <b>The</b> <b>Sounds</b> compiled a 64–77 record, leaving them in third-place. On June 30, Tike Redman became the first Sounds player to hit for the cycle. Redman also holds <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> franchise record for the most triples (30) during his career with the team. Despite finishing the 2002 season with a 72–71 record under Brown, it was only good enough for a third-place finish, two-and-a-half games out of first place. Chad Hermansen, who played for <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> from 1998 to 2002, holds three career franchise records: runs (303), home runs (92), and runs batted in (286).|$|E

Some Yankees present at the game included owner George Steinbrenner, coach Yogi Berra, and players Reggie Jackson, Bucky Dent, Lou Piniella, Bobby Murcer, Goose Gossage, Tommy John, and Johnny Oates. The Yankees returned for another game against <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> on April 28, 1983. Former Sound Don Mattingly, as well as Yankees manager Billy Martin and pitcher Goose Gossage were in attendance. <b>The</b> <b>Sounds,</b> who trailed the Yankees, 4–0, going {{into the bottom of the}} ninth inning, scored five runs to beat the Yankees, 5–4, before a crowd of 13,641.|$|E

5|$|The aging Greer Stadium was {{not meant}} to last longer than 30years, and was the subject of many renovations in the early 2000s to meet minimum Triple-A standards.

After two years of <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> lobbying for the new park and threatening to leave town (either for the suburbs or a new city altogether), Mayor Bill Purcell agreed to support preliminary plans for the stadium on October 25, 2005, and the Nashville Metro Council approved the new stadium on February 7, 2006, due in part to <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> securing construction financing through a consortium of banks and avoiding taxpayer expense. It was to be called First Tennessee Field. Opening day at the proposed new venue was repeatedly pushed back, eventually to as late as April 2009. However, <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> and private developers Struever Brothers, Eccles, & Rouse were unable to finalize financing and design plans for the new stadium by the April 15, 2007, deadline set by the Metro Council.
