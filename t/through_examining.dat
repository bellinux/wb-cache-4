25|$|There {{is clear}} {{dimorphism}} between queen and worker A. pallipes {{with the former}} caste observed to be physically superior in 22 characters. Pre-imaginal determination has been referenced to be the reason for differentiation between them. A stark {{difference between the two}} castes of females can be seen <b>through</b> <b>examining</b> their ovaries – type A ovaries display filament-appearance with no developed oocytes whereas type B ovaries were longer and well developed and coupled with several mature oocytes. Type B ovaries also contained sperm and could very clearly be categorized as those of queens where as type A ovaries were observed as uninseminated thus identifying as those of workers. This dimorphism displays strong control of sexual organs upon pre-imaginal determination.|$|E
25|$|This {{uprooting}} {{raises the}} question of why Calvinus was permitted to displace such a venerable shrine. The Church Fathers associate Mutunus with groupings of other deities that are assumed {{to be based on the}} lost theological works of Varro. <b>Through</b> <b>examining</b> these connections, Robert Palmer concluded that the old cult of Mutunus was merged with that of Father Liber, who was variously identified with or shared attributes with Jupiter, Bacchus, and Lampsacene Priapus. Palmer further conjectured that it was Mutunus, in the form of Liber, to whom Julius Caesar made sacrifice on the day of his assassination, receiving the ill omens that the conspirator Decimus Brutus urged him to ignore. Caesar had previously celebrated his victory at the Battle of Munda on the Liberalia, or festival of Liber held March 17, and he visited the house of the pontifex Calvinus on the Ides of March, near the archaic shrine of Mutunus-Liber. In Palmer's view, the evident ill favor of the god gave Augustus license to reform the cult during his program of religious revivalism that often disguised radical innovations. The god was then Hellenized as Bacchus Lyaeus.|$|E
500|$|Neurolinguistics is {{historically}} {{rooted in the}} development in the 19th century of aphasiology, the study of linguistic deficits (aphasias) occurring {{as the result of}} brain damage. [...] Aphasiology attempts to correlate structure to function by analyzing the effect of brain injuries on language processing. [...] One of the first people to draw a connection between a particular brain area and language processing was Paul Broca, a French surgeon who conducted autopsies on numerous individuals who had speaking deficiencies, and found that most of them had brain damage (or lesions) on the left frontal lobe, in an area now known as Broca's area. Phrenologists had made the claim in the early 19th century that different brain regions carried out different functions and that language was mostly controlled by the frontal regions of the brain, but Broca's research was possibly the first to offer empirical evidence for such a relationship, and has been described as [...] "epoch-making" [...] and [...] "pivotal" [...] to the fields of neurolinguistics and cognitive science. [...] Later, Carl Wernicke, after whom Wernicke's area is named, proposed that different areas of the brain were specialized for different linguistic tasks, with Broca's area handling the motor production of speech, and Wernicke's area handling auditory speech comprehension. [...] The work of Broca and Wernicke established the field of aphasiology and the idea that language can be studied <b>through</b> <b>examining</b> physical characteristics of the brain. [...] Early work in aphasiology also benefited from the early twentieth-century work of Korbinian Brodmann, who [...] "mapped" [...] the surface of the brain, dividing it up into numbered areas based on each area's cytoarchitecture (cell structure) and function; these areas, known as Brodmann areas, are still widely used in neuroscience today.|$|E

2500|$|Rusty Barrett {{suggests}} {{that the idea of}} the homogeneous speech community could perhaps be more accurately replaced by one of a queer community based on community spirit or a queer cultural system, since language use varies so greatly. Kulick proposes, instead of studying speech communities that he concludes [...] "do not and cannot exist" [...] because of methodological problems, researchers should study [...] "language and desire" [...] <b>through</b> <b>examining</b> repression in the context of linguistics, considering both what is said and what is not or cannot be said. Kulick addresses the need for consideration of the role of sexuality in sexual identity, unlike some lavender linguists who neglect sexuality in favor of linguistic features that might be more likely than sexuality to legitimize gay identity.|$|E
