30|$|Edelman and Geradin {{proposed}} a few {{ways in which}} platforms such as Airbnb could be regulated without compromising market efficiency for both consumers and service providers [14]. In a similar vein, Koopman et al. [15] made a case for policy change. Einav et al. [16] took a systematic approach and spelled out {{pros and cons of}} a few cities’ current regulations. Stephen Miller proposed to legalize the short-term rental market through “transferable sharing rights” [5], where each house owner has the right to engage in a short-term rental for a given period of time. This right can be sold to others, if the owner does not wish to engage. The revenues generated by the sharing right market would go to both the city council, which would be able to raise revenues without raising taxes any further; and to neighborhood groups, which would be compensated for any externality. Then, to ensure market efficiency, web platforms could sell <b>transferable</b> <b>sharing</b> rights in a way similar to what StubHub does when selling tickets. Other academics have taken a more hands-off stance, however. Being an innovation, Airbnb should not be excessively regulated, Ranchordas argued [17]. The general principle behind his proposal is that innovations should not be stifled by regulation. Cohen and Sundararajan opted for self-regulatory approaches and for leaving regulatory responsibility to parties other than the government [18]. Finally, to regulate the sharing economy, one should understand what ‘sharing’ means in that context. Zale offered a taxonomy of ‘sharing’, including formality and gratuity [19], and Ikkala and Lampinen showed that Airbnb transactions are not purely financial – they are mediated by hospitality and sociability [20].|$|R

Sometimes it is important to look at the legislation in order to find out the purpose of a company. The wording varies in different countries but some do not state a specific purpose. It must be also remembered that there are other obligations that are imposed on companies and their directors by other laws and regulations. These relate especially to social responsibility. It has been recognised that most of the successful companies are acting responsibly. It must be also noticed that there are some big crises that have arisen from directors’ negligent behaviour, such as Enron and BP’s oil spill. Whatever the purpose is, it must be remembered that in order to create successful business, the directors have a variety of issues to consider and take care of.

40|$|For most of {{the period}} {{associated}} with the Industrial Revolution in Britain, English law restricted access to incorporation and the Bubble Act explicitly outlawed the formation of unincorporated joint stock companies with <b>transferable</b> <b>shares.</b> Furthermore, firms in the manufacturing industries most {{closely associated with the}} Industrial Revolution were overwhelmingly partnerships. These two facts have led some scholars to posit that the antiquated business organization law was a constraint on the structural transformation and growth that characterized the British economy during the period. Importantly, however, the vast majority of manufacturing firms in the modern sector were partnerships. An easy explanation for the predominance of partnerships is that the legal restrictions on access to the joint stock form gave entrepreneurs no other choice of legal vehicle for their collective enterprises. It is not a large leap to then argue that these restrictions inhibited the development of the English economy. Those who make this argument implicitly envision a counterfactual in which legal restrictions on the joint stock form were absent, firms in the modern sector used the joint stock form to access external sources of funds to finance investment, and consequently capital accumulation and output accelerated more rapidly in the modern sector. The goal of this Essay is to challenge this view and to point towards other possible explanations for industrial entrepreneurs’ use of the partnership form. In short, the restrictions on access to the joint stock form lacked bite. While firms did not have general access to incorporation until 1844, creative businessmen and lawyers crafted an alternative legal form—the unincorporated joint stock company—that served as a functional replacement for the business corporation. Restrictions on unincorporated joint stock companies were unenforced and largely ignored. Thus, the use of the partnership by entrepreneurs in the modern sector must be understood as a choice; the law did not dictate their firms’ legal form. This Article proposes a resolution of this puzzle based on the pecking order theory of corporate finance. For the vast majority of firms in the modern sector it was optimal to use only debt, not equity, for any external financing. Industrial entrepreneurs chose the partnership form because it minimized the costs of debt financing. The unlimited liability of partners gave firm creditors additional collateral and provided better incentives against opportunism by partners, thereby lowering the cost of credit to the firm. Furthermore, the tighter nexus between control and residual financial claims in the partnership form resulted in better incentives for the owner-managers to exert effort and make efficient decisions in running the firm. Part II begins with a short overview of the early history of the joint stock form in England and then turns to the legal framework for business organization during the Industrial Revolution and explain that the supposed restrictions on organizing as a joint stock company were not binding. Part IV develops an explanation based on the pecking order theory of corporate finance for why industrial entrepreneurs nonetheless organized their businesses as partnerships...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 The West Coast {{groundfish}} individual {{fishing quota}} program divided fishing rights among commercial trawl fishermen into <b>transferable</b> quota <b>shares</b> in 2011. Instead of allocating {{the full 100}} % of shares to fishermen, the Pacific Fishery Management Council made a bold decision to hold 10 % of the quota shares for each of 28 species aside in an adaptive management program. These shares were an insurance policy for the substantial changes occurring under the new management regime; by holding something aside, the Council could later direct these shares toward {{one or more of}} the five adaptive management program objectives: stabilizing fishing communities, stabilizing fish processors, facilitating new entrants, addressing conservation concerns, or responding to other unintended outcomes of the individual fishing quota program. But after almost five years, the Council has not yet developed the adaptive management program and the shares have not been assigned to meet their intended objectives. Instead current quota share owners receive adaptive management program quota pounds in addition to what they already own. Here, I suggest six policy options for the adaptive management program to meet the Council’s stated objectives, and consider each option in terms of effectiveness, politically viability and implementation feasibility. While no policy can clearly be seen as superior to others using the dimensions analyzed, the strengths and weaknesses of the various options become more transparent. This assessment can contribute to continued discussion in the Council process...|$|R
40|$|We {{define a}} very general group {{manipulation}} idea {{and the corresponding}} stability concept of “absence-proofness”. In the first chapter, we analyze this concept in surplus <b>sharing</b> <b>transferable</b> utility games, exchange economies with private endowments and fair division problems. Solutions that are stable in our sense are core selections. We also show that it is weaker than population monotonicity in cooperative games and fair division problems, and very demanding for the allocation problems with private endowments. Particularly, the Walrasian allocation rule is not immune to manipulation. Also, {{it is the first}} external stability concept defined for fair division problems. In the second chapter, we work on cooperative stability in cost sharing of a minimum cost spanning tree and give a family of stable solutions that are responsive to the asymmetries in the cost data. Interpreting population monotonicity as a strong stability property, in the third chapter, we study population monotonicity in the fair division of indivisible goods where monetary compensations are allowed. We show that if there are more than three goods no efficient solution satisfies this property. For the two goods case we define hybrid solutions that are efficient and population monotonic...|$|R
40|$|Although {{fisheries}} management decisions impact people and places, multiple drivers of change are {{at play in}} coastal communities. Moreover, the interactions among those drivers, whether they build upon or offset one another, are where the action lies. While interested in the changes {{brought about by the}} imposition of <b>transferable</b> catch <b>shares,</b> this research takes a holistic approach to studying coastal communities. This study focuses on instances of transition from a greater presence of the fishing industry to new configurations of fisheries, maritime sectors, and tourism. Situated in places in the midst of such change, the work clarifies what fisheries dependence represents and its various iterations. ^ Through three case studies in Northern Jutland, Denmark and three analogous cases in New England, United States this research explores how various coastal communities navigate change. I detail the experiences of place-based communities in these two regions with special attention to those historically linked to fishing, but whose orientations have been changing over the past few decades. Based on 54 interviews with 63 persons and field observations while in these two regions, the research takes an inductive approach, open to the themes and discourses brought forth by research participants in relation to fisheries and change in their communities and related societies. The qualitative analysis of interview transcripts and field notes illuminated varying relationships that place-based communities have to fishing and the varied opportunities and challenges facing coastal communities. ^ One of the key findings of this research is the demonstration of existential fisheries dependence, whereby the presence of fishing sustains certain coastal communities that have few or no alternatives, keeping them on the map, so to speak. Physical geography and built infrastructure heavily influence this designation and reveal important considerations for management changes regarding fisheries access. In cases where communities and ports have diversified to other activities, often connections to fisheries remain because of the development of service ports. Moreover, the uncertainty in regard to the future level of engagement of fisheries has implications for waterfront land use planning and community identity. ^ Development of new industries and the process of diversification may also span longer timelines, affecting certain segments of the community more severely than others. In addition, the transition to tourism dependence holds a somewhat precarious future for coastal communities in temperate areas. In some cases, heritage and community identity remain strongly connected to the surviving fishing industry, but the diminished presence of fishing also translates to feelings of loss and can challenge communities that hope to retain a year-round population when the tourists head home. Consequently, how a society manages fisheries impacts coastal communities ranging in size and opportunities outside of fisheries. Moreover, the cultural and social importance of fisheries demonstrates a key facet of fisheries dependence. ...|$|R
