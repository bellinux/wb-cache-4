5|$|At {{this point}} Díaz {{tried to come}} to terms with Madero, {{particularly}} after the capture of Cuautla by the Zapatistas in south-central Mexico. Together with his finance minister and main advisor, José Yves Limantour, Díaz planned to make concessions to <b>the</b> <b>fairly</b> moderate Madero and, once Madero was pacified, crack down hard on the more radical elements among the rebels. A truce was agreed to on April 23.|$|E
5|$|Plots {{are often}} {{set in motion}} by events, ranging from <b>the</b> <b>fairly</b> typical to the supernatural and extraordinary, which {{frequently}} happen in the town. The boys often act as the voice of reason when these events cause panic or incongruous behavior among the adult populace, who are customarily depicted as irrational, gullible, and prone to vociferation. The boys are also frequently confused by the contradictory and hypocritical behavior of their parents and other adults, and often perceive them as having distorted views on morality and society.|$|E
5|$|Series {{creator and}} {{executive}} producer Butch Hartman wrote Wishology, along with head writer {{and executive producer}} Scott Fellows and writer Kevin Sullivan, who joined the series beginning its fifth season. Gary Conrad, who has directed several episodes of the series since its second season, served as the director for Wishology. Composer Guy Moon, {{who has worked on}} the music for <b>The</b> <b>Fairly</b> OddParents since its inception, composed the music. Like the entire series, Wishology was produced in hand-drawn animation mixed with computer animation by Frederator and Billionfold Studios for Nickelodeon. The production of the trilogy required 18 months to complete, according to Toon Zone's interview with Hartman.|$|E
50|$|Though <b>the</b> <b>Fairlies</b> {{decide to}} revolt, the attack {{proceeds}} anyway, with fireworks launching {{out of control}} across Disneyland in daytime. Mattie and Nick {{try to stop the}} attack, supported by Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters. <b>The</b> <b>Fairlies</b> defeat their holders and Mattie and Nick find Tia Dalma {{at the top of the}} Matterhorn, with resurrected Maleficent directing the fireworks. (It's supposed that the Traveler is actually the Devil and Tia Dalma, his offspring, is the Grim Reaper.) Using their electricity, they destroy Maleficent and Tia Dalma.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fairlies</b> on <b>the</b> Ffestiniog Railway were {{designed}} to burn coal. Following trials in 1971, in common with most other Ffestiniog engines, they were modified to burn oil. In 2005, Earl of Merioneth was converted to coal having been built as an oil burner. [...] The success of this conversion resulted in Merddin Emrys, the oldest of <b>the</b> FR <b>Fairlies,</b> being converted back to coal burning in 2007.|$|R
50|$|The Fairlie Estate near Old Rome and Gatehead {{had been}} known as 'Little Dreghorn', until William Fairlie of Bruntsfield near Edinburgh gave it his family name in around 1704. Members of this family can be {{confused}} with <b>the</b> <b>Fairlies</b> of that Ilk.|$|R

25|$|The {{metropolitan}} Area {{formed by}} Santa Cruz and La Laguna {{is served by}} the Tranvía de Tenerife (Tenerife Tram) which opened in early 2007, after 3 years of intensive works. <b>The</b> <b>fairly</b> lengthy line from Santa Cruz {{up the hill to}} La Laguna serves almost 20 stops. A second line within La Laguna was added in 2009.|$|E
50|$|An earlier {{structure}} {{was held by}} the Braids, then by <b>the</b> <b>Fairlies,</b> but passed to the Forresters of Niddry by marriage. From them, {{it went to the}} Mowbrays of Barnbougle in the 16th century, and then to the Dundas family who probably built the core of the current building. Later, in 1628, it passed to the Scotts of Harperigg.|$|R

Miss Halcombe and Miss Fairlie are away just now on a visit to some friends in Yorkshire." ...|$|R

25|$|Bede's {{account of}} Chad's death {{strongly}} confirms the main themes of his life. Primarily {{he was a}} monastic leader, deeply involved in <b>the</b> <b>fairly</b> small communities of loyal monks who formed his mission teams, his brothers. His consciousness was strongly eschatological: focussed on the last things and their significance. Finally, he was inextricably linked with Cedd and his other actual brothers.|$|E
25|$|Despite its steeper {{learning}} curve, {{this method}} remains popular in Chinese communities that use traditional Chinese characters, such as Hong Kong and Taiwan; the method allows very precise input, thus allowing users to type more efficiently and quickly, provided they {{are familiar with}} <b>the</b> <b>fairly</b> complicated rules of the method. It was the first method that allowed users to enter {{more than a hundred}} Chinese characters per minute.|$|E
25|$|Mexican and Mexican-style cheeses {{have become}} more common on grocery shelves in the United States. Until recently, only <b>the</b> <b>fairly</b> common cheeses were available, mostly in Mexican restaurants, such as Cotija, {{sprinkled}} on top of certain dishes, and Oaxaca cheese, melted on tortillas. Now, companies in the US are recreating many of the fresh and aged cheeses from Mexico, with some even attempting the production of lesser-known varieties.|$|E

50|$|Fairlie Castle is a {{restored}} oblong tower castle {{located on a}} natural rounded knoll situated above a precipitous section of the Fairlie Glen {{near the town of}} Fairlie in the old Barony of Fairlie, Parish of Largs, North Ayrshire, Scotland. It was built by the now extinct family, <b>the</b> <b>Fairlies</b> of that Ilk and survives in a fairly good state of preservation.|$|R
50|$|If {{circumstances}} of depth and water clarity allow {{the position of}} the sun to produce sufficient variation in brightness, this may indicate the direction of the sun, and be used as a cue to orientation. The effect is greater if the sun is relatively low in the sky, the water is clean, <b>the</b> depth <b>fairly</b> shallow and <b>the</b> surface <b>fairly</b> smooth.|$|R
25|$|During the {{development}} of T95 tank, {{it became clear that}} it would not have a significant advantage over the M48A2. The X-shaped motor and optical rangefinder were both discarded due to performance, and the accuracy of the smoothbore gun continued to be unsatisfactory. All this led to the closure of the project on July 7, 1960. At the same time, work on the T95E7 turret was continued, which {{led to the creation of}} <b>the</b> <b>fairly</b> successful M60A1 turret.|$|E
25|$|The ARV Super2 has {{received}} favourable reviews which {{describe it as}} an aircraft with excellent visibility that is pleasant to fly. The small wing area and <b>the</b> <b>fairly</b> high wing loading produces handling that is responsive but stable. A drawback is the shortage of luggage space which makes the ARV unsuitable for touring. The second prototype, G-STWO, has a fuselage luggage compartment aft of the fuel tank which is accessed from the starboard aside, but no other ARVs have this feature.|$|E
25|$|Penn did {{not always}} pay {{attention}} to details, and had not taken <b>the</b> <b>fairly</b> simple step of determining where the 40th degree of latitude (the southern boundary of his land under the charter) actually was. After he sent letters to several landowners in Maryland advising the recipients that they were probably in Pennsylvania and not to pay any more taxes to Lord Baltimore, trouble arose between the two proprietors. This led to an eighty-year legal dispute between the two families.|$|E

25|$|The {{solution}} was {{offered by the}} CDS. With {{the addition of the}} new Digital Picture Transmission system (DPT), a single ship carrying Type 984 and CDS could pass off information to any ship with an output display and the DPT radio equipment. This allowed destroyers to get their initial cueing from the 984 while being positioned some distance away, which was important given <b>the</b> <b>fairly</b> short range of Seaslug. When the cruiser design was canceled, this need became more pressing. Pye Ltd. was given the production contract.|$|E
25|$|Anholt {{belonged to}} the parish of Morup in the Danish {{province}} of Halland {{until the middle of}} the 16th century, when a church was built on the island itself. The island remained Danish when Denmark ceded Halland to Sweden in 1645. A story claims that a negotiator had left a glass of beer placed over the island on the map during the peace negotiations. A more plausible explanation is that Swedish forces had not conquered <b>the</b> <b>fairly</b> remote island and had little interest in it.|$|E
25|$|On January 27, 2009, {{one of the}} coaster cars did {{not make}} it over the last hill on <b>the</b> <b>Fairly</b> Odd Coaster and stalled. No one was hurt, and once the lap bars were unlatched, the riders in the stalled car were let off. The other two cars on the circuit were stopped safely by the computer's {{actuation}} of the ride's air brakes. The ride's air brakes made a noise like a gunshot, which caused a small panic. The ride was running normally the next day.|$|E
50|$|On {{the night}} Mr. Hartright arrives at Limmeridge, he bumps {{into a woman}} in white. She speaks cryptically, and {{inquires}} {{if he is to}} stay with <b>the</b> <b>Fairlies.</b> When a carriage arrives, she runs off. Mr. Gilmore, the Fairlies' attorney, tells him that the woman must have been a villager. When Hartright meets the two sisters, he mistakes Laura for the woman in white because of the strong resemblance.|$|R
