5000|$|<b>The</b> 14th <b>Brooklyn,</b> <b>the</b> 69th New York Militia and 11th New York would charge up Henry House Hill four times, in {{an effort}} to {{recapture}} Ricketts and Griffins cannon. The other two regiments met with little success, but <b>the</b> 14th <b>Brooklyn</b> found gaps and weaknesses in the Confederate lines and exploited them. <b>The</b> 14th <b>Brooklyn</b> briefly took control of the two guns following one charge, only to be routed yet again by the Confederates. The constant charging of <b>the</b> 14th <b>Brooklyns</b> tactics caught <b>the</b> eye of General Jackson himself. This is when he made his famous statement to his troops: [...] "Hold On Boys! Here come those Red Legged Devils again!" [...] With that the regiment received its nickname the [...] "Red Legged Devils".|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Battle of <b>Brooklyn</b> rivalry is <b>the</b> {{rivalry between}} the Long Island University Blackbirds and St. Francis College Terriers. <b>The</b> Battle of <b>Brooklyn</b> is a fierce rivalry, {{particularly}} in men's college basketball, between <b>the</b> LIU <b>Brooklyn</b> Blackbirds and St. Francis Brooklyn Terriers athletic teams. The {{intensity of the}} rivalry is augmented by {{the proximity of the}} two universities, located only one mile apart in Downtown <b>Brooklyn.</b> <b>The</b> name of the rivalry is in reference to the first major battle of the American Revolutionary War, <b>the</b> Battle of <b>Brooklyn.</b>|$|R

5|$|Abramson was {{a leading}} {{architect}} of synagogue-centers at that time. He designed a number of New York examples, including the original synagogue-center, the Manhattan Jewish Center (1918), as well as <b>the</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> Jewish Center, the Flatbush Jewish Center, and the Ocean Parkway Jewish Center (all constructed in Brooklyn between 1920 and 1924). While the Flatbush Jewish Center has been completely remodeled, <b>the</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> and Ocean Parkway Jewish Centers are visually similar to the East Midwood Jewish Center, and <b>the</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> Jewish Center in particular has an identical layout. The written evidence consists of an entry in a souvenir journal commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the Flatbush Jewish Center, stating that Abramson drew East Midwood's plans. The NRHP nomination form speculates that Abramson drew the basic plans for the East Midwood Center, and that the Building Committee completed them, {{in order to save}} money.|$|E
50|$|Weinstein {{ministers to}} Jewish {{students}} at Pratt Institute (where {{he serves as}} Chair of its Religious Affairs Committee), Brooklyn Law School, Long Island University, and Polytechnic Institute of New York University.

50|$|<b>The</b> 2007 <b>Brooklyn</b> tornado was <b>the</b> strongest tornado {{on record}} to strike in New York City.

5|$|Even {{before leaving}} <b>the</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> Navy Yard on June 29, 1871, the {{expedition}} ran into personnel troubles. The cook, a seaman, a fireman, and assistant engineer Wilson deserted. The steward {{turned out to}} be a drunk, and was left in port.|$|E
5|$|From Boston, Edwards {{moved to}} New York {{to stay for}} some ten years, {{performing}} on stage and participating in insect studies. He was active in <b>the</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> and New York Entomological Societies. In 1881, he co-founded and edited a butterfly enthusiast's periodical entitled Papilio, named for the genus Papilio in the swallowtail butterfly family, Papilionidae. Edwards served as editor until January 1884 when he gave the reins to his friend Eugene Murray-Aaron of Philadelphia. Papilio was published until 1885 when its subscription base was merged into the more general Entomologia Americana, published by <b>the</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> Entomological Society.|$|E

50|$|The New York and South Brooklyn Ferry {{operated}} a ferry from the Battery Maritime Building (formerly known as Municipal Ferry Pier) to <b>the</b> South <b>Brooklyn</b> 39th Street Ferry Terminal, where rail transfer (to <b>the</b> South <b>Brooklyn</b> Railway) was possible until 1935.|$|R
50|$|In 1909, <b>the</b> South <b>Brooklyn</b> Railway {{was granted}} a request by the Public Services Commission to {{discontinue}} {{the use of the}} Third Avenue freight yard and station, on the Prospect Park and Coney Island Railroad's property. The freight house, which was leased from the LIRR, was deteriorating, and <b>the</b> South <b>Brooklyn</b> Railway did not want to build a new one on LIRR property, instead preferring to build a replacement on the property of the New York and Sea Beach Railroad, using Sea Beach trackage to access the new terminal. <b>The</b> South <b>Brooklyn</b> Railway bought another locomotive. In 1913, all of the BRT's lines were reorganized, and all ownership of freight operations was transferred to <b>the</b> South <b>Brooklyn</b> Railway.|$|R
50|$|The {{location}} of <b>the</b> South <b>Brooklyn</b> Railway helped {{in the construction}} of new BRT subway and elevated lines in Brooklyn, as materials could be brought in via its trackage. A temporary connection at 38th Street and Fourth Avenue allowed South Brooklyn Railway equipment to enter the BMT Fourth Avenue Line construction site. In June 1922, <b>the</b> South <b>Brooklyn</b> Railway bought much of the LIRR-owned Prospect Park & Coney Island Railroad. By 1923, the Prospect Park & Coney Island Railroad and the New York & Coney Island Railroad were merged into <b>the</b> South <b>Brooklyn</b> Railway. <b>The</b> BRT filed bankruptcy that year and was reorganized into the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation, which still operated <b>the</b> South <b>Brooklyn</b> Railway.|$|R

50|$|While <b>the</b> 14th <b>Brooklyn</b> and 11th New York Volunteer Infantry were {{briefly in}} control of the two guns, the Louisiana Tigers {{advanced}} up the hill. The 14th and 11th fired upon the battalion from their superior position, causing significant losses. The Tigers then fired their own rifles, and the majority of the 14th fell to their knees. Encouraged by this, the Tigers dropped their rifles and took out their Bowie knives in an attempt to finish off the survivors. As the Tigers neared the crest of the hill, <b>the</b> 14th <b>Brooklyn</b> stood up. Though both <b>the</b> 14th <b>Brooklyn</b> and <b>the</b> Tigers, who had left their rifles {{at the bottom of the}} hill, were poorly trained and lacked real wartime experience, a savage hand-to-hand fight began between the two units. Though the Tigers fought with ferocity and determination, <b>the</b> 14th <b>Brooklyn</b> had <b>the</b> superior field position and eventually the Tigers retreated back down the hill. This brief confrontation permanently made <b>the</b> 14th <b>Brooklyn</b> and <b>the</b> Tigers rivals.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> South <b>Brooklyn</b> Railway, {{along with}} the other non-rapid transit {{properties}} of the BMT, was transferred to the New York City Board of Transportation on June 1, 1940.
