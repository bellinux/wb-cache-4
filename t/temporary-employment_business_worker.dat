40|$|This study {{analyzes}} worker {{perspectives on}} the financing responsibilities of <b>businesses,</b> <b>workers</b> and government for dislocated worker programs that provide job search and retraining assistance to unemployed workers. It {{is based on a}} survey of 1, 555 experienced workers in Illinois. Joint <b>business</b> and <b>worker</b> financing approaches were the most favored and least polarizing financing alternative. In contrast, the government grant approach was extremely polarizing with significant support but strong negative reaction among higher-income, white, and college-educated workers. Surprisingly strong negative reaction was also found among lower-income, blue-collar workers. The results are consistent with related research on the conservative attitudes of American workers toward social welfare programs. Copyright 1992 by The Policy Studies Organization. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the present status of {{informal}} business activities of Central Business District (CBD) area of Dhaka, capital city of Bangladesh and issues regarding socio-economic development of it. Data for the study is collected from a sample of 153 informal <b>business</b> <b>workers</b> within Motijeel area, the CBD of Dhaka city. A semi-structured questionnaire is used to generate survey data and then analyzed through simple statistical methods. Demographics of the respondents show that most of them are young and middle aged with limited educational qualification. They face shortage of capital as majority relies on their own savings. Moreover, maximum workers have monthly income below than BDT 15, 000. However, almost all of them are willing to expand current business, though many find it competitive enough. The study will be useful to the policy makers for improving present status of the informal workers. From the government level, policy can be initiated for better environmental planning as well as improving socio-economic conditions of the informal <b>business</b> <b>workers.</b> However, the study opens the scope for further comprehensive study in related development areas...|$|R

50|$|In recent history, {{a debate}} between the advocates and critics of {{community}} colleges gained strength.

Critics argued that community colleges continued a culture of privilege through training <b>business</b> <b>workers</b> at public expense, not allowing the working class to advance in social class, protecting selective admissions at four-year institutions for the nation's elite, and discouraging transfer through cooling out.|$|R

The law requires unions to have prior consent and to adhere to lengthy mandatory arbitration and appeal procedures before striking. The law prohibits employers and the government from retaliating against strikers; however, the transitional government did not enforce this law in practice and sometimes jailed striking public sector employees.|$|R

In social policy, various reforms {{were carried out}} {{in areas such as}} labour rights, care for the elderly, child support, and assistance for people with disabilities. In 1995, a law on family-care leave was introduced which made it mandatory for employers to grant a maximum of three consecutive months leave to male and female employees who need to take constant care of a family member, and prohibited employers from dismissing employees for taking family-care leave. Safety standards concerning mobile cranes were established in 1995, and amendments made to the Radiation Safety Law of 1960 and the Radiation Safety Law of 1957 in 1995 extended coverage to previously excluded rental <b>business</b> <b>workers,</b> rental <b>business</b> offices, and rental businesses. Amendments made to the Radiation Hindrance Prevention Law of 1957 in 1995 extended the law to cover rental <b>business</b> <b>workers,</b> rental <b>business</b> offices, and rental businesses. In July 1995, a law came into effect that imposed strict liability, or liability without fault, upon manufacturers and importers of defective products. The Food Sanitation Law of 1995 introduced a comprehensive food safety system. In 1995, an amendment to the Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law made gun possession a more serious offence, and the Science and Technology Basic Law passed that same year provided the framework of Japan’s science and technology policy.|$|R
