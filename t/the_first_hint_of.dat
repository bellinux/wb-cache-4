5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> a {{localization}} appeared {{when the}} Agito trademark filed for European territories in September 2013. Later, at TGS 2013, Tabata said that Agito {{would definitely be}} localized, although he refused to clarify whether this meant it would be released in western territories. An official western release was confirmed by Square Enix at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014. The plan for the international release was to first release Final Fantasy Type-0 HD so players in the west could get accustomed {{to the world and}} characters, then release Agito as a separate experience rather than a parallel release. With its discontinuance in Japan, Agitos western release was consequently cancelled, however it was stated that Type-0 Online was being considered for international release in place of Agito.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> {{his death}} to the Soviet people came at 7:15 p.m. Moscow Time, when the usual {{television}} programs were altered and a pop music concert {{was replaced by a}} documentary on Vladimir Lenin. On Vremya, the Soviet Union's state television newscast, the hosts wore somber clothes instead of their normally informal dress code. At first, Soviet citizens believed it was Andrei Kirilenko who had died, as he had not been present at the 65th anniversary of the October Revolution a few days earlier (he died in 1990). Furthermore, other abrupt changes to the television line-up occurred, such as the appearance of an unscheduled program of war reminiscences and the replacement of an ice hockey game on Channel Two with Tchaikovsky's Pathétique symphony. Brezhnev's death was announced on 11 November simultaneously by Soviet radio and television hosts. The television announcement was read by Igor Kirillov with tears in his eyes at 11 a.m. Moscow Time.|$|E
5|$|Olympus had {{a market}} {{capitalisation}} of ¥673billion on 13 October 2011, immediately before Woodford was sacked. By {{the end of}} the next day, the valuation had fallen to ¥422billion ($5.5billion). Analysts at Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Nomura Securities, concerned about corporate governance issues at the company as well as its balance sheet, all immediately downgraded their stock ratings. Goldman Sachs, who had only upgraded its rating in a report dated 12 October, suspended its coverage after Woodford was removed from office. Nomura and JPMorgan announced on 20 October that their coverage of the company was halted. It was reported that Government of Singapore Investment Corp., the Singapore sovereign wealth fund {{which was one of the}} principal shareholders, immediately disposed of its 2percent stake on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> scandal. The share price plunged several days running upon market fears that the shares would be delisted as the company could not meet its reporting mandatory deadline for its quarterly results; in the week to 18 November Nippon Life announced that its stake had been reduced by one-third, from 8.18 percent to 5.11 percent, because of the uncertainty; Mitsubishi reduced its stake from 10 percent to 7.6 percent.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> its {{existence}} became public when Square Enix trademarked the name in May 2013. The game was first {{announced in the}} second September issue of Famitsu Weekly, and was demoed during TGS 2013. Originally scheduled for release {{in the winter of}} 2013, it was delayed due to development problems concerning environment sizes, which needed to be scaled down. It was rescheduled for the first quarter of 2014, then was pushed forward to spring of that year. Street clothes for the characters were offered as a pre-registration bonus, while a code to download outfits inspired by Kurasame, a supporting character from Type-0, were included in the final volume of the spin-off manga Final Fantasy Type-0 Side Story: Reaper of the Icy Blade. Pre-registration closed on May 7, 2013. Chapter delivery began the day after the game's official release on May 14, 2014. The base game was a free download, but players had the option of buying items, restore health and speeding up re-spawn time via microtransactions. The original version also reset individual character experience levels {{at the end of a}} playthrough, while an update in 2015 allowed players to carry over experience levels between playthroughs.|$|E

500|$|Lyon {{was born}} on February 5, 1875, in Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois. [...] His family {{included}} his father, Captain Marcus Ward Lyon Sr.; his mother, Lydia Anna Lyon; and his two brothers, Henry S. Lyon and James W. Lyon. [...] Because of his father's military career, Lyon's family moved across the United States throughout his childhood and adolescence. [...] <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> the young Lyon's future scientific interests came while they were stationed at Watertown Arsenal, near Boston, Massachusetts, where he began collecting insects and animals from the local area. [...] No other details of his early life were documented until 1893, when he graduated from Rock Island High School—his father had evidently been re-stationed at Rock Island Arsenal at about this time. [...] He attended Brown University and completed his Ph.B. in 1897, which included training in biology. [...] In 1898, he began his graduate studies at George Washington University, obtaining his M.S. in 1900, his M.D. in 1902, and his Ph.D. in 1913.|$|E

500|$|The {{songs on}} the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, {{developed}} the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's [...] "Death of a Clown". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, [...] "Autumn Almanac", in early October. Backed with [...] "Mister Pleasant", the single became another Top 5 success for the group. Andy Miller points out that, despite its success, the single marks {{a turning point in}} the band's career—it would be their last entry into the UK Top Ten for three years: [...] "In retrospect, 'Autumn Almanac' marked <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> trouble for the Kinks. This glorious single, one of the greatest achievements of British 60s pop, was widely criticised at the time for being too similar to previous Davies efforts." [...] Nick Jones of Melody Maker asked, [...] "Is it time that Ray stopped writing about grey suburbanites going about their fairly unemotional daily business? ... Ray works to a formula, not a feeling, and it's becoming rather boring." [...] Disc jockey Mike Ahern called the song [...] "a load of old rubbish". Dave's second solo single, [...] "Susannah's Still Alive", was released in the UK on 24 November. It sold a modest 59,000 copies, but failed to reach the Top 10. Miller states that [...] "by the end of the year, the Kinks were rapidly sliding out of fashion".|$|E

[...] The label Rio D Brasil ("River of Brazil") is given near Porto Seguro, just below the São Francisco River, almost certainly an indicator of a river where ample brazilwood could be found on its shores. That label is repeated on subsequent maps (e.g. Canerio map of 1505).|$|E
50|$|Scientists' {{consensus}} is that a layer of liquid water exists beneath Europa's surface, and that heat energy from tidal flexing allows the subsurface ocean to remain liquid. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> a subsurface ocean came from theoretical considerations of tidal heating (a consequence of Europa's slightly eccentric orbit and orbital resonance with the other Galilean moons).|$|R

2500|$|He knew untrained militiamen, which {{composed}} {{a large portion}} of his force, were generally unreliable in battle, and in the past had routed at <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> defeat and abandoned the regulars. (The Battle of Camden had ended in disaster when the militia, which was half of the American force, broke and ran as soon as the shooting started.) [...] To eliminate that possibility, he defied convention by placing his army between the Broad and Pacolet rivers, thus making escape impossible if the army was routed.|$|E

[...] A week after the surrender of the fortress, he {{sent a letter to}} the Elector of Mainz, Karl Theodor von Dalberg and returned his officer's commission. It seemed to him that, in the prime of his life, he could expect for little advancement in service to an elector who would not even spend money on fortifications and who fled at <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> danger. On the other hand, the scope of significant activity under the banner of France seemed infinite.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, the Kargil War between India and Pakistan {{became the}} first direct {{conflict}} between two declared nuclear powers. As the war progressed, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> the possible use of a nuclear weapon was on 31 May, when Pakistani foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmad made a statement warning that an escalation of the limited conflict could lead Pakistan to use [...] "any weapon" [...] in its arsenal. This was immediately interpreted as an obvious threat of a nuclear retaliation by Pakistan {{in the event of}} an extended war. The leader of Pakistan's senate noted that [...] "the purpose of developing weapons becomes meaningless if they are not used when they are needed." [...] Some experts believe that following nuclear tests in 1998, Pakistani military was emboldened by its nuclear deterrent cover to markedly increase coercion against India.|$|E

2500|$|In 1613, Cervantes {{published}} the Novelas Ejemplares, {{dedicated to the}} Maecenas of the day, the Conde de Lemos. Eight {{and a half years}} after Part One had appeared, we get <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> a forthcoming Segunda Parte (Part Two). [...] "You shall see shortly," [...] Cervantes says, [...] "the further exploits of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza." [...] Don Quixote, Part Two, published by the same press as its predecessor, appeared late in 1615, and quickly reprinted in Brussels and Valencia (1616) and Lisbon (1617). Part two capitalizes on the potential of the first while developing and diversifying the material without sacrificing familiarity. Many people agree that it is richer and more profound. Parts One and Two were published as one edition in Barcelona in 1617. Historically, Cervantes's work has been said to have [...] "smiled Spain's chivalry away", suggesting that Don Quixote as a chivalric satire contributed to the demise of Spanish Chivalry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first two}} episodes are based mostly in a true-to-life universe. Episode three follows suit, but ends with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> supernatural themes when Shang Tsung appears to freeze time to {{converse}} with Johnny Cage. Episodes 4 and 5 reveal {{the most in the}} issue of Tancharoen's stylistic approach to the real-world/mysticism debate. Baraka is portrayed true to his original backstory from the video games, and ideas such as sorcery and multiple realms are fleshed out. Criticism has been leveled at the production team for abandoning the original real-world approach of Rebirth for Legacy, despite Tancharoen continuously stating that the supernatural elements of Mortal Kombat would be included in the series. Tancharoen said that some stories could be told in his realistic Rebirth approach but that other stories were too grounded in the supernatural to be converted to a real-world portrayal. The release of Episode 6 includes a note from Tancharoen himself, written to the fans before the episode begins: [...] "The following episode represents my different take on the Mortal Kombat universe. I think it combines the perfect amount of gritty realism mixed with a hint of mysticism. I hope you guys enjoy it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two [...] holes were drilled {{from the}} surface into areas where the miners were {{believed}} to be; microphones and video cameras lowered into them for ten-minute periods {{did not find any}} signs of life. Air quality tests performed through the first hole on the morning of January 3 indicated that carbon monoxide (CO) levels {{in that part of the}} mine were at 1,300 parts per million. Officials called this [...] "very discouraging." [...] A third hole encountered groundwater and could not be drilled all the way down. However, the miners were trained to find a safe part of the mine and barricade themselves into it in the event of an explosion or collapse. Experts expected that a third hole, if successful, could expand the opening and provide a better way of rescuing the miners than proceeding into the mine. Miners are required to carry a SCSR that provides a one-hour supply of oxygen for evacuation. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> the miners' status came around 5:00p.m. on January 3 when it was reported that a body had been found. Because of the location of the body, those familiar with the miners and their jobs believed it was the fire boss, Terry Helms. Hours later, just before midnight, rumors spread quickly that 12 of the 13 miners had been found alive. Thirty minutes later, the rescue team told company officials that the original report was incorrect.|$|E

2500|$|Up to this time, the German-speaking {{population}} {{had not been}} subjected to violence and nor had the Italian authorities interfered with its cultural activities, traditions and schooling. This {{was about to change}} with the rise of fascism. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> what was to come was experienced by the German population on Sunday April 24, 1921. The population of Bolzano-Bozen had organized a Trachtenumzug (a procession in traditional local costume) to celebrate the opening of the spring trade fair. The General Civil Commissioner of the province, Luigi Credaro, had been warned in advance by his colleagues from Mantua, Brescia, Verona and Vicenza of the intention of the fascists there to go to Bolzano-Bozen to disrupt the procession, but did not take any precautions. After arriving by train in Bolzano-Bozen the approximately 280 out-of-province fascists were joined by about 120 from Bolzano-Bozen, and proceeded to attack the procession with clubs, pistols and hand grenades. The teacher Franz Innerhofer from Marling was shot dead and around 50 people injured in the attack. After the attack the military intervened and escorted the fascists back to the station. Although Credaro, under orders from the Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti, had two suspects in Innerhofer's murder arrested, nobody was brought to justice for the attack, as Benito Mussolini had threatened to come to Bolzano-Bozen with 2,000 fascists to free the two suspects by force if they were not set free immediately. Mussolini made clear his policies regarding the people of South Tyrol: ...|$|E
