40|$|Falling {{water drops}} from a {{dripping}} faucet, illuminated from above, exhibit {{a row of}} bright strips of light, a few centimeters apart at a fixed distance below the faucet. Flash photographs of the drops {{show that they are}} oblate in shape when the flashes occur and the bright flashes of light originate {{from the edge of the}} drop that is on the opposite of <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>light</b> source. Here we show that that the spots result from the same internal reflection that gives rise to the rainbow in a cloud of spherical drops. The periodic flashes reflect the capillary oscillations of the liquid drop between alternating prolate and oblate shapes and the dramatic enhancement in the oblate phase result from a combination of several optical effects. Ray tracing analysis shows that the flashes occur when the rainbow angle, which is 42 deg in spherical drops, but sweeps over a wide range between 35 deg and 65 deg for typical ellipsoidal drops and the intensity of the caustic is strongly enhanced in the oblate phase. This phenomenon can be seen in all brightly lit water sprays with millimeter size drops and is responsible for their white color...|$|E
40|$|Circadian rhythms {{are present}} in all living organisms; daily {{oscillations}} of biological process from {{the expression of a}} gene to the number of times that an animal displays a given behaviour. The light/dark cycle is the primary cue that entrains these rhythms and the suprachiasmatic nuclei, within the hypothalamus are the central pacemaker which synchronises peripheral body clocks. Mice are useful circadian biology models and two peripheral circadian outputs were studied, locomotor activity and the rhythm of body temperature in a common inbred strain, the C 57 BL/ 6 mouse. The use of individually ventilated cages to house mice increases biocontainment, enabling the maintenance of high health status colonies and reducing the risk of allergies for laboratory personnel. The effect of these sealed units on ambient light levels was examined, using locomotor activity as a marker of entrainment to the light/dark cycle. Mice housed closer to <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>light</b> source experienced greater levels of illumination than those at the lower levels, yet all entrained to the light/dark cycle. Mice housed lower on the rack showed more activity during light hours when they normally rest and the onset of activity was advanced in relation to the time the lights turned off. Individually ventilated cages do not therefore compromise circadian entrainment but cage position may alter the distribution of rest and activity in relation to the light cycle. Measuring the rhythm of body temperature of animals is often confounded by the stress associated with immobilisation and restraint. A novel non-invasive method, a thermal imaging camera was trialled against an indwelling intraperitoneal implant, to compare the relationship between peripheral and core body temperature under different light cycles. A stable relationship was found between the two methods (average R² value = 0. 92) and this persisted in conditions of constant darkness, where lack of light cues resulted in free-running of the rhythm, assuming a shorter period length of oscillation. This novel method has potential for use in circadian phenotyping studies and to improve welfare, following experimental interventions where the mouse, a small, metabolically active animal is at risk of hypothermia...|$|E

40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the effects of {{geomagnetic}} fields on plants. The present work was undertaken to answer the question whether plants can perceive the geomagnetic fields (Galland and Pazur 2005). Our findings show that the effects of magnetic fields on various responses in Arabidopsis thaliana result in a characteristic multi-peaked pattern in the stimulus-response curves with multiple maxima (peaks) and minima (valleys). These multi-peaked stimulus-response curves display a unique phenomenon in biology. They are distinctively different from the stimulus-response curves, observed in plant physiology, showing a pattern of rising exponential functions, with a plateau finally. The magnetic response also depended upon the fluence rate of <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>light,</b> the responses being higher at higher fluence rates. However, the magnetic fields apparently are able to manifest their effects even in darkness. The two double mutants displayed variations in their response to magnetic fields, as compared to Ler seedlings, although the basic pattern of effects remained the same. Additionally the effects were enhanced in phyAphyB double mutants as compared to cry 1 cry 2 double mutants indicating suppression of cryptochrome-mediated magnetic effects by phytochromes. These stimulus-response curves are difficult to explain on the basis of the criteria required by the radical-pair model. The effects of magnetic fields were observed not only in darkness but also in cry 1 cry 2 double mutants. Experiments also revealed responses of the Arabidopsis seedlings to magnetic fields even under red light. Interestingly our data are in good correlation with data obtained by Binhi (2001) while working on DNA of E. coli. They got similar stimulus-response curves with similar peak positions as have been observed by us. Binhi and coworkers explained their observations in the theoretical framework of the “ion-interference mechanism”. A comparison of the effects of magnetic fields of the various organizational levels of Arabidopsis plant, i. e., on hypocotyl length, anthocyanin accumulation, abundance of specific mRNA‟s and proteins reveal maximum effects on gene transcription (12 -fold approx.), which were reduced to about 6 -fold in case of anthocyanin accumulation and were further reduced to only about 2. 5 -fold in case of suppression of hypocotyl length by blue light in Arabidopsis. We, therefore state that the effects at transcriptional level get balanced out at higher levels of organization (biochemical pathway, growth response) in order to provide “Magnetohomeostasis”...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} is to determine design limitations and architectural solutions that limit the impact light from displays and indicator lamps have on the operational environment task lighting and lighting countermeasure spectrum constraints. It is concerning that this innovative architectural lighting system, could be compromised by spectrums from display systems, architectural materials, and structures that are not considered as part a full system design implementation. The introduction of many Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) products to the spacecraft volume that contain LEDs, without consideration to the human factors and biological constraints, is another problem. Displays and indicators are {{a necessary part of}} the spacecraft and it is the goal of this research project to determine constraints and solutions that allow these systems to be integrated while minimizing how the lighting environment is modified by them. Due to the potentially broad scope of this endeavor, the project team developed constraints for the evaluation. The evaluation will be on a set of tasks that required significant exposure in the same environment while having a large chance of impacting the light spectrum the crew is expected to receive from the architectural lighting system. The team plans to use recent HRP research on "Net Habitable Volume" [1] to provide the boundary conditions for volume size. A Zemax lighting model was developed of a small enclosure that had high intensity overhead lighting and a standard intensity display with LED indicator arrays. The computer model demonstrated a work surface illuminated at a high level by <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>light</b> source compared to displays and indicators whose light is parallel to the work plane. The overhead lighting oversaturated spectral contributions from the display and indicator at the task work surface. Interestingly, when the observer looked at the displays and LEDs within the small enclosure, their spectral contribution was significant but could be reduced by reflecting overhead light from the wall(s) to the observer. Direct observation of displays and LEDs are an issue because the user's viewing area is a display, not an illuminated work surface. Since avionics command centers consume significant crew time, the tasks that seemed at higher risk for unwanted spectral contributions as an operational volume with significant quantity of displays and indicators that were either under direct observation of the crew or impacting a volume the crew may be required to sleep in...|$|E
40|$|Abstract 1 -cell embryo {{transfer}} is best performed after allowing injected embryos a little recovery time in culture. This allows better {{evaluation of the}} cells' survival - {{those that have been}} damaged during the injection process will undergo cytoplasmic condensation, causing the cellular material to become less glossy and darker in color as the cytoplasm shrinks away from the zona pellucida. This should be balanced against the increased survival rate with decreased in vitro exposure. ### The Recipient Careful selection of the recipient is most important as the pups are the end result of a lot of hard work. I personally use Swiss Webster mice, as they are quiet and make excellent mothers, although do become overweight quickly and exhibit bad planes of anesthesia when heavy. This is also a very inexpensive mouse to use. As an alternate, another strain I have used with considerable success is B 6 D 2 F 1. These mice are hardy and display hybrid vigor. ### The Equipment For surgery, I clean (with 70 % alcohol) the following (all Roboz instruments) : 1. 5 pairs of forceps - 1 pair Pattern 3 c - 2 pairs Pattern 55 superfine - 1 pair straight serrated, 3. 5 " - 1 pair curved serrated, 3. 5 " - 1 pair of 3. 5 " sharp / sharp scissors (Surecut) - Autoclip metal wound clipper - 1 serafin clip - 1 mouth pipetter and hand-pulled transfer pipette ### The Anesthetic Avertin (2, 2, 2 tribromoethanol) is found to be quite effective. For method of preparation, see "Manipulating the Mouse Embryo", CSHL Press, ISBN 0 - 87969 - 384 - 3. Store wrapped in tin foil at 4 oC as this reagent is light sensitive. Test after making a new batch. Shake well before use. ### The Transfer 1. Select a mouse that has been plugged by a vasectomized male where the plug has been visualized in the early morning of the injection day. Do not use an mouse that appears lighter than 25 g, as underweight mice tend to re-absorb the embryos as they are not physically ready to support a pregnancy. Overweight mice can make surgery difficult by the absorption of anaesthetic into the fat reducing the potency of the anesthetic; also, the presence of fat means the presence of blood vessels, and cutting through all the extra fat causes a lot of unnecessary bleeding. This makes it difficult to see what you are doing and may also clog up the tip of your transfer pipette. - Anesthetise mouse with Avertin, administered intraperitoneally. After administering the anesthetic, put the mouse back into the cage from which it came. The mouse will be more relaxed when placed in a familiar environment and the anesthetic will act more quickly than it would on a distressed mouse. - To check that the mouse is fully anesthetised, press or squeeze the pads of the feet. If the mouse can feel this it will try to withdraw its leg from your grasp (Pedal reflex). Do not commence surgery until there is no reflex reaction to this test. - Take the anesthetised mouse and lay it on it's belly on a petri dish lid, taking care to keep the airway clear by resting the teeth {{on the edge of the}} petri dish. This makes it easier to move the mouse around without having to actually touch it. Swab the incision area with 70 % ethanol. ### The Surgery 1. Incision site Use the pair of Surecut scissors and one pair of serrated, curved forceps for cutting the skin. The incision should be made approximately 0. 5 cm away from the midline and between the natural hump of the back and the point where the rear leg joins the abdomen. Using a (lint-free) tissue dampened with 70 % ethanol, carefully wipe the incision site, sweeping away the cut hair. Wipe the scissors with a 70 % ethanol dampened tisue to remove any hair. Grasping one side of the incision at a time, carefully introduce the blades of the scissors (while closed) between the inside of the pelt and the body wall for approximately 1 cm. Open and close the blades to clear the connective tissue in this area. Move the skin around until the nerve (a white line, usually seen with associated capillary) can be seen running across the body wall. The light color of the ovarian fat pad can be seen under the body wall in this area. Using a pair of pattern 3 c forceps, pinch the body wall and nick to give an incision 0. 5 cm across. Reach in with the straight serrated forceps (while holding the body wall with another pair of curved forceps) and grasp the ovarian fat pad, and remove to the exterior where it can be anchored using a serafin clip. - Rest the serafin clip across the mouse's back to hold the uterus in place. If the uterus or uterine horn continually slip back into the cavity it may be necessary to gently lie the mouse on the side being careful not to block the airway. The transfer pipette should now be loaded. A minimum of 12 embryos total must be transferred, any less than this and the chances of a pregnancy resulting are severely reduced. Embryos may be implanted in both oviducts or unilaterally. The transfer pipette can be loaded a number of different ways; the following is one popular method. Take up an amount of Hepes buffered medium in the tip of the transfer pipette, then make a small bubble by taking up a little air. Then take up some more medium - roughly the same volume as the air bubble, then another air bubble, same size as before. Then take up about 2 - 3 cm of buffered media and then a tiny air bubble once more. Take your embryos in the smallest possible volume of medium, lining them up side by side in the transfer pipette. Introduce another tiny air bubble when all the eggs are loaded. Some people use mineral oil instead of or in conjunction with air bubbles for pressure control. This is a perfectly acceptable practice; however care must be taken to avoid introducing mineral oil into the oviducts as this can dramatically reduce litter size by interfering with the ciliary-driven egg transport in this structure, as well as predisposing the animal to uterine infection. - Bursa siteOnce the pipette is loaded and the uterus positioned, move the petri dish lid supporting the mouse to the microscope and turn on <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>light</b> source. Once the lights and focus have been adjusted and the mouse positioned to suit yourself, use the pattern 55 superfine forceps to gently tear open a small hole in the transparent bursa membrane at the point btween the ovary and oviduct where the infundibulum is located. Take care to avoid rupturing the small capillaries that run across the bursa as these will obscure your view of the infundibulum. You may drop some epinephrine on the ovary / oviduct / bursa before tearing the hole to reduce any bleeding that may occur. Once there is a hole of sufficient size to reach the infundibulum, grasp it at the end with one pair of pattern 55 forceps while inserting one blade of the other set into the tube itself. This will ensure that the mouth of the infundibulum will be open and accessible to your transfer pipette. Introduce the transfer pipette into the infundibulum as far as possible (until the tube's natural curve allows no more forward progress without risk of damage) and expel the eggs into the structure, chasing them with the air bubbles used for pressure regulation. These bubbles will prevent the eggs from flowing backwards easily and drive them forward into the ampulla region of the oviduct. - Wound clip With the transfer complete, the serafin clip can now be removed and the uterus gently eased back into the body. Do not touch the uterus, but ease it back by the edges of the incision in the body wall and allowing the uterus to fall back in, without actually handling it. This procedure is then repeated on the other uterine horn if doing a bilateral transfer. The incision in the body wall is not sutured. The skin is closed with Autoclips - two per incision is usually sufficient. Autoclip wound clips are used on the skin instead of suture as the mice frequently will chew at the suture thread and effectively open their wounds. - Once surgery is complete, the mouse is placed in a box of clean autoclaved sawdust. Under anesthetic, mammals are unable to retain heat as effectively as when conscious. For this reason, the mouse should be wrapped in a tissue to help keep it warm. Use of a heating pad or even indirect heat from a slide warmer can be used to care for the animal post-operatively until it regains conciousness. All animals should have recovered sufficiently from anesthetic before being returned to the animal room and left unattended. Recipient mice should be handled with care as pregnant mice become easily stressed, sometimes leading to abortion, or even cannibalism of pups. If all goes well and a pregnancy results, the pups should be born approximately 19 - 21 days after the transfer, dependent upon strain...|$|E

40|$|Method: Blastocyst {{transfer}} is usually performed 24 hours after aggregation when the morulae have become expanded blastocysts {{and on the}} same day as injection. A little time is given between injection and transfer to allow blastocysts to re-expand. **The Recipient** Careful selection of the recipient is most important as the pups are the end result of a lot of hard work. Two strains of mice are used:RB Swiss and (CBA*C 57 BL 6 /J) f 1. RB Swiss are quiet and make excellent mothers but they become overweight quickly and do exhibit bad planes of anaesthesia. CBA*C 57 mice are hardy and display hybrid vigour. They do not carry excess weight and go under anaesthetic well. This strain can be very nervous when housed separately which could be dangerous to their young. They are most suitable if a young RB Swiss is placed into the cage as a companion which can be removed as soon as the pups are seven days old. By this age destruction of the litter is very unlikely. If the CBA mother is to be housed alone she must not be disturbed for ten days. **Prior to surgery, sterilise the following:** - 3 pairs of curved forceps - 2 pairs of iris scissors - 1 pair suture clamps - 1 serafin clip - sterile suture with needle attached (small - for mouse surgery) - Michelle clips (small size) - Michelle clip applicators - 1 mouth pipette and flame-polished transfer pipette - You will also need an anaesthetic. Rompun / Ketavet is found to be quite effective. To make up 10 ml: - 0. 5 ml 2 % Rompun (20 mg/ml Xylazine) - 0. 5 ml 100 mg/ml Ketavet 100 - Delta Veterinary Lab, 8 Rosemead Rd Hornsby NSW 2077 - Make up to 10 ml with PBS - The dosage is 0. 02 ml/g body weight - Store wrapped in tin foil at 4 °C. - Shake well before use as it tends to separate in the fridge. **The Transfer** 1. Select a mouse that is 2. 5 days pseudo pregnant and weigh. Do not use anything lighter and 25 g or anything heavier than 30 g. Underweight mice tend to re-absorb the embryos as they are not physically ready to support a pregnancy. Overweight mice make surgery difficult in the absorption of anaesthetic into the fat reduces the potency of the anaesthetic. Also, the presence of fat means the presence of blood vessels, and cutting through all the extra fat causes a lot of unnecessary bleeding. This makes it difficult to see what you are doing and may also clog up the tip of your transfer pipette. - Anaesthetise mouse with Rompun / Ketavet, administered intraperitoneally. After administering the anaesthetic, put the mouse back into the box from which it came. The mouse will be more relaxed when placed in a familiar environment and the anaesthetic will act more quickly than it would on a distressed mouse. - To check that the mouse is fully anaesthetised, press or squeeze the pads of the feet. If the mouse can feel this it will try to withdraw its leg from your grasp. Do not commence surgery until there is no reflex reaction to this test. - Take the anaesthetised mouse and shave its lower back. Lay mouse on belly on a petri dish lid taking care to keep the airway clear by resting the teeth {{on the edge of the}} petri dish. This makes it easier to move the mouse around without having to actually touch it. Swab the shaven area with hibitane or 70 % ethanol. - Instruments should have been laid out. Use one pair of iris scissors and one pair of forceps for cutting the skin - call these "outside" instruments. Use one pair of iris scissors and two pair of forceps for working inside the mouse - called the "inside" instruments. - Using the outside forceps and scissors, make a small cut (about 1 cm long) along the dorsal midline of the lower back. Through the shaven, moistened skin it is fairly easy to see blood vessels. Try to avoid these vessels when making the incision (see below). - Using a pair of outside forceps and inside forceps, pick up the skin and separate skin from the body wall and cut the body wall as indicated about 5 mm long, avoiding blood vessels. - If the cut has been made in the right place, the ovarian fat pad is easily visible. If not, the fat pad can be located by lifting the edge of he body wall and scouting around with the other pair of inside forceps. Once you have located the fat pad attach serafin clip to it, taking care not to clip ovary. It is important not to damage the ovary as it is responsible for hormone production throughout pregnancy. Gently ease the ovary, oviduct and part of the uterus out through the incision in the body wall. DO NOT PULL. A traumatised uterus will contract and move quite violently, making surgery difficult and may cause expulsion of the transferred blastocysts. When the tip of the uterus is visible, rest the serafin clip across the mouse's back to hold the uterus in place. If the uterus or uterine horn continually slip back into the cavity it may be necessary to gently lie the mouse on the side being careful not to block the airway. - The transfer pipette should now be loaded. Five or six embryos must be transferred to each horn, any less than this and the chances of a pregnancy resulting are serverely reduced. It may be loaded to suit yourself but this is a method that is popular. Take up a minute amount of DMEM with Hepes in the very tip of the transfer pipette, then make a small bubble by taking up a little air. Then take up some more medium - roughly the same volume as you hope to transfer the blastocysts in. Take up another bubble, same size as before. Then take up your blastocysts in the smallest possible volume of medium, lining them up side by side in the transfer pipette. This is how your transfer pipette should look when loaded. - This will take some practise. Make sure that you are competent at loading a transfer pipette before any attempt at a blastocysts transfer. During surgery is not the time to learn how to load a pipette. If it is likely to take you more than a few minutes to load the transfer pipette, then do not expose the uterus until the pipette has been loaded. This prevents drying out and further trauma tot he uterus. Alternatively, the uterus, ovary, etc. may be moistened repeatedly with a sterile cotton bud and saline. - Once the pipette is loaded and the uterus positioned, move the petri dish lid supporting the mouse to the microscope and turn on <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>light</b> source. Once the lights and focus have been adjusted and the mouse positioned to suit yourself, gently grasp the top of the uterine horn with a pair of inside forceps. Whilst still holding the horn with one hand, use the other hand to gently insert a 26 gauge hypodermic needle through the uterine wall (close to the oviduct) and into the lumen. Choose an area of the uterus that is relatively devoid of blood vessels as blood will clot in the tip of your pipette and block it. Remove the needle and carefully (so as not to lose the site of the hole), without averting your eyes, pick up the loaded transfer pipette. Gently insert the transfer pipette about 3 mm into the uterine lumen. Gently blow the blastocysts into the uterus, using the air bubbles in your transfer pipette to monitor the transfer. Be careful not to blow any air into the uterus. Once {{transfer is}} complete, quickly rinse out transfer pipette in some HEPES buffer medium (M 2) and check to see if there were any blastocysts stuck in the transfer pipette. If there were, transfer these blastocysts again. - With the transfer complete, the serafin clip can now be removed and the uterus gently eased back into the body. Do not touch the uterus, but ease it back by the edges of the incision in the body wall and allowing the uterus to fall back in, without actually handling it. This procedure is then repeated on the other uterine horn. The incision in the body wall is not sutured. The skin is closed with Michelle clips - two per incision is usually sufficient. Michelle clips are used on the skin instead of suture as the mice will chew at the suture thread and effectively open their wounds up. - Once surgery is complete, the mouse is placed in a box of clean autoclaved sawdust. Under anaesthetic, mammals are unable to retain heat as effectively as when conscious. For this reason, and also because the animal has been shaven, the mouse should be wrapped in a tissue to help keep it warm. This will also be used as bedding until the fur has grown back. It is also very important that the mouse by house alone as anaesthetised animals are often buried by cage mates who think they are dead. All animals should have recovered sufficiently from anaesthetic before being returned to the animal room and left unattended. The cage should be placed on a shelf away from male mice, as strange male pheromones will often cause females to abort. Recipient mice should be handled with care and tiptoed around as pregnant mice are easily upset, sometimes leading to abortion, or even cannibalism of pups. If all goes well and a pregnancy results, the pups should be born sixteen days after the transfer...|$|E
50|$|Smith enjoyed {{much success}} in his rookie {{years with the}} Montreal Maroons. He was playing his 20th game for the Maroons in 1930-31 when Howie Morenz was sent flying into the Maroons net and knocked off Smith, who was so badly injured that he was out {{for the rest of}} the season. Smith spent the next 2 seasons in the minors working on his rebound-control and {{all-around}} game. It was there in the minors that Smith started wearing his distinctive cap to stop the glare of <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>lights</b> from blinding him.|$|R
5000|$|Ideally, {{the design}} of a {{building}} would create multiple switches for <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>lighting.</b> Adjusting these settings would allow the optimal light intensity to be delivered, the most common version of this control being the [...] "three-level switch", also called A/B switching. Much of the benefit of the excess illumination reduction comes from a better ratio of natural light to fluorescent light that can result from any of the above changes. Research has been conducted showing worker productivity gains in settings where each worker selects his or her own lighting level.|$|R
25|$|The {{band was}} backed by both an six-member {{instrumental}} band and a complement of ten backup dancers (five male and five female). The band would sometimes split up and perform with one member to each side or corner of the stage, but {{for much of the}} show, they performed to one side at a time, circling the stage (often as part of the choreographed dancing) throughout each song. The backup dancers sometimes performed for opposite side of the stage as the band. A video feed of the show was shown on video screens circling <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>lighting</b> rig.|$|R
40|$|Using Eames House of Cards as inspiration, I {{created an}} artist book that {{incorporated}} my design and photography skills {{together in one}} artwork. My artist book, the House of Photography, demonstrates the two-dimensional qualities of photography (the individual images on each card) in a three-dimensional interactive design (the architectural structure that is formed when the cards are interlocked). Since I have {{always been interested in}} voyeuristic photography (photographing people when they are not aware of the camera), I wanted to use this artist book as an opportunity to explore this aspect of photography even further. The House of Photography conceptually balances its voyeuristic subject with its architectural format. Architecture is usually seen as cold and static; however, using images of real people interacting within a space brings life and vibrance into the structure itself. In the installation of the House of Photography, lights were placed {{at the base of the}} architectural structure. When <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>lights</b> were on, <b>the</b> architectural structure was seen within the daytime atmosphere of the space. Periodically, <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>lights</b> would dim and the structure's base lights would turn on to represent the nighttime atmosphere. Extra photographs were also placed at the base of the structure. People were allowed to add on to or take away photographs from the structure. By allowing people to manipulate the physical architecture of the work, they could create an artwork of their own using my photographs and original structure. Honors College"May 2009.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>lights</b> are {{for cars}} {{approaching}} the metering point; the low-mounted two-phase lights {{are intended to}} be used by the vehicle {{at the front of the}} queue. In normal operation of the ramp meters, only the red and green lamps are used. However, when ramp metering is about to be enabled, <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> lamps may show flashing or solid yellow to warn drivers to prepare to stop. (Once ramp metering is turned on, there is no further need for the yellow lamp.) In California, some meters allow two or three cars to proceed on a green light. These meters use red-yellow-green signals on both the upper and lower mounts on the pole, and operate in a standard green-yellow-red fashion.|$|R
50|$|Miller's {{first and}} most famous stunt {{happened}} on November 6, 1993 during the heavyweight title fight between Riddick Bowe and Evander Holyfield. Miller descended {{into the side of}} the ring area during the second minute of the seventh round of the fight, after circling Caesars Palace for ten minutes. The lines of his paraglider became tangled in <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>lights,</b> after which he landed on the top rope of the ring with his parachute still tangled in the lights. He tried to hang on with one foot and one hand on that top rope for a few seconds until he either fell or was dragged down into the crowd by spectators, his parachute ripping away from the lights above.|$|R

500|$|Abraham {{created a}} light-control system {{in an attempt}} to keep <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> from being unflattering. However, after unsuccessfully {{attempting}} to implement the necessary wiring to control each light, the production team established controlling rows of light. Pat O'Mara, the key grip during production, installed several 2x1 and 2x2 blackout panels and frames that were retrofitted with small albeit strong magnets. During a scene when and actor or actresses stood under a fluorescent light, a panel or a frame was placed over the fixture, subsequently diffusing light onto their faces. [...] "If somebody was walking through the office in a wide shot, I just turned <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>lights</b> on. But if Don was talking to someone at his desk and the office was the backdrop, I turned all the lights on and then selectively removed some; then, I brought the key around with Kino Flo Image 80s through 4-by-8 frames of 250 or 216, or sourced my key with a larger Fresnel through the window." ...|$|R

5|$|In {{many animals}} {{of the deep}} sea, {{including}} several squid species, bacterial bioluminescence is used for camouflage by counterillumination, in which the animal matches <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> environmental <b>light</b> as seen from below. In these animals, photoreceptors control the illumination to match {{the brightness of the}} background. These light organs are usually separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria.

5|$|The agents find Banton at {{the train}} station, but he runs to a poorly lit area. He {{declares}} that walking into his shadow will kill the agents, so Mulder shoots out <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>lights.</b> Banton allows himself {{to be taken to}} a mental hospital, where he is put in a room with soft light per his own request. He tells the agents that the accident in his lab caused his shadow to behave like a black hole, splitting atoms into component particles and reducing matter into pure energy. Banton claims that the deaths were all accidents, and that the government wants to exploit him. Detective Ryan and her superior officer stop the questioning, declaring the case closed, despite Mulder's objections. Mulder contacts X (Steven Williams), who assures him that the government has no interest in Banton. However, X and two associates later attempt to remove Banton from the hospital by cutting the power. In the process, the two attendants are killed when the emergency lights turn on and Banton's shadow falls upon them. Banton flees from the hospital.|$|R
