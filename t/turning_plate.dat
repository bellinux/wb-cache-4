5000|$|The journal {{built on}} the legacy of other {{short-lived}} literary publications, in particular Revista Celor L'alți and Insula, both {{of which had been}} founded by poet Ion Minulescu. A follower of French Symbolist critic Rémy de Gourmont, Minulescu had previously launched radical appeals to innovation, which some critics consider the first expressions of Romanian avant-gardism, and which established connections not just with Symbolism, but also with the Futurism of Italian writer Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. However, literary critic Paul Cernat notes, Ion Minulescu [...] "did not have the virtues of an ideologue and a theorist." [...] Thus, Simbolul was called by Cernat [...] "a <b>turning</b> <b>plate</b> between the Symbolism of Insula contributors and pre-avant-gardist Post-symbolism." ...|$|E

40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2015 The project {{focused on}} {{creating}} {{a method of}} prevention for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in low-income hospitals. PPH a severe loss of blood after a woman gives birth and {{the leading cause of}} maternal mortality worldwide. In low and middle income countries, the shortage of skilled birth attendants means that maternal death due to PPH is especially common. Uterine atony is when the uterus does not contract after birth and is {{the most common cause of}} PPH. The current method for preventing PPH is called the Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL), which includes the administration of uterotonic drugs, placenta removal, and manual massage by a doctor, nurse, or midwife. The solution produced by this project is a mechanical massaging device that is meant for use when a medical professional is not available to perform the uterine massage. The design of the massaging device includes a housing, motor, <b>turning</b> <b>plate,</b> and silicone cover with a nylon insert. The silicone rests in direct contact with the patient’s skin and the <b>turning</b> <b>plate</b> applies pressure through the nylon, silicone, and skin and onto the smooth muscle of the uterus. The shear force felt by the uterus causes contraction and prevents PPH. The massaging device is held onto the patient using a vinyl securing mechanism which is weighted on each side. The weights keep the securing mechanism in place without requiring straps around the patient backs. The prototype of this device was successfully fabricated and tested during the course of this semester and proved to be effective, safe, and durable. This article serves to report the details of this design project...|$|E

5000|$|The triode is a {{normally}} [...] "on" [...] device; {{and current}} flows {{to the plate}} with zero voltage on the grid. The plate current is progressively reduced as the grid is made more negative {{with respect to the}} cathode. Usually a constant DC voltage ("bias") is applied to the grid to set the DC current through the tube, and the varying signal voltage is superimposed on it. A sufficiently negative voltage on the grid, usually around 3-5 volts in small tubes such as the 6AV6, but as much as -130 volts in early audio power devices such as the '45, will prevent any electrons from getting through to the <b>plate,</b> <b>turning</b> off the <b>plate</b> current. This is called the [...] "cutoff voltage". Since below cutoff the plate current ceases to respond to the grid voltage, the voltage on the grid must remain above the cutoff voltage for faithful (linear) amplification.|$|R
40|$|While cell-substrate adhesions {{that form}} between the {{protruding}} {{edge of a}} spreading cell and flat surfaces have been studied extensively, processes that regulate the maturation of filopodia adhesions are far less characterized. Since {{little is known about}} how the kinetics of formation or disassembly of filopodia adhesions is regulated upon integration into the lamellum, a kinetic analysis of the formation and disassembly of filopodia adhesions was conducted at the leading edge of b 3 -integrin-EGFP-expressing rat embryonic fibroblasts spreading on fibronectin-coated glass or on soft polyacrylamide gels. Filopodia b 3 -integrin adhesions matured only if the lamellipodium in their immediate vicinity showed cyclic protrusions and retractions. Filopodia b 3 -integrin shaft adhesions elongated rapidly when they were overrun by the advancing lamellipodium. Subsequently and once the lamellipodium stopped its advancement at the distal end of the filopodia b 3 -integrin adhesion, these b 3 -integrin shaft adhesions started to grow sidewise and colocalize with the newly assembled circumferential actin stress fibers. In contrast, the suppression of the cyclic protrusions and retractions of the lamellipodium by blocking myosin light chain kinase suppressed the growth of filopodia adhesion and resulted in the premature disassembly of filopodia adhesions. The same failure to stabilize those adhesions was found for the advancing lamellipodium that rapidly overran filopodia shaft adhesions without pausing as seen often during fast cell spreading. In <b>turn,</b> <b>plating</b> cells on soft polyacrylamide gels resulted in a reduction of lamellipodia activity, which was partially restore...|$|R

50|$|Demand {{has also}} experimented with film in {{works such as}} Tunnel (1999), a {{tracking}} shot from a driver’s perspective through an empty tunnel lined by concrete pillars; the tunnel is modelled on the Paris underpass where Princess Diana died. Recorder (2002) is a 35 mm-film loop in which a paper model of an eight-track reel-to-reel recording device appears to play the Beach Boys album Smile (1966), a recording that was until recently lost; {{the sound of a}} piano playing a variation on ‘Bicycle Rider’, an instrumental from the Smile sessions, can be heard on the soundtrack. Rolltreppe (Escalator) (2000) is an animation of 24 still images shown in a continual loop. Showing an escalator without people, taken from surveillance footage, Demand here is referencing an escalator near Charing Cross Bridge in London where a gang was caught on surveillance camera shortly after they had robbed two men and thrown them into the Thames, killing one of them. Trick (2004) refers back to the beginnings of cinema and is based on one of the first films of the Lumière brothers, Assiettes tournantes (<b>Turning</b> <b>Plates)</b> of 1896. The one-minute film re-creates a sequence in which a performer executes a stunt by spinning a set of bowls and plates on a tabletop. Camera (2007) presents a surveillance camera as it pans a public space, complete with ambient sound. In Rain (2008), Demand painstakingly re-created the effect of raindrops falling onto a hard surface, using cellophane candy wrappers and a sound track of eggs frying.|$|R
