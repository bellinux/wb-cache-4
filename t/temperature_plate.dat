40|$|The {{effects of}} {{radiation}} and rotation on unsteady hydromagnetic free convection flow of a viscous incompressible electrically conducting fluid past an impulsively moving infinite vertical plate with ramped temperature in a porous medium are investigated. Exact solution of momentum and energy equations, under Boussinesq approximation, is obtained in closed form by Laplace transform technique. To compare the results obtained in this case with that of isothermal plate, exact solution of the governing equations is also obtained for isothermal plate. The expressions for the primary and secondary skin frictions and Nusselt number are also derived. It is noticed that, for both ramped temperature and isothermal plates, rotation retards fluid flow in the primary flow direction whereas it accelerates fluid flow in the secondary flow direction in the boundary layer region while radiation exerts accelerating influence on the fluid flow in both the primary and secondary flow directions. For ramped <b>temperature</b> <b>plate</b> radiation reduces primary skin friction whereas it tends to increase secondary skin friction. For isothermal plate radiation has tendency to reduce secondary skin friction. Radiation tends to increase fluid temperature for both ramped temperature and isothermal plates. With the increase in time {{the rate of heat}} transfer at the plate is reduced for isothermal plate while it is increased for ramped <b>temperature</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|E

There are, however, several problems of physical interest that may require non-uniform or arbitrary wall conditions. Several researchers (e.g., [18 – 21]) have investigated problems of free convection from a vertical plate with step-discontinuities in the surface temperature. Chandran et al.

Experiments were carried out {{to determine whether or not}} avocado pathogens infect latently to cause body rots during winter in New Zealand. The aim of these experiments was to investigate if fungicides need to be applied in winter by determining the time at various temperatures in which spores of Colletotrichum acutatum and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides will form appressoria, and spores of Colletotrichum acutatum, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Botryosphaeria parva and Phomopsis sp. germinate.

Effect of {{the severe}} {{deformation}} by multi-pass rolling on microstructure and tensile properties was analyzed {{in terms of}} rolling <b>temperature,</b> <b>plate</b> thickness, and cooling rate for a modified API X 65 steel containing B. The plates, 80 and 50 mm thickness, were rolled six times by 20 %/pass (total 75 %) to 20 and 12 mm, at 1023 K of unrecrystallized γ region or 973 K of intercritical (α+γ) region, and then quenched in water or oil. All specimens except one oil-quenched condition showed relatively high UTS 700 - 830 MPa and the continuous yielding(YR～ 0. 6), typical mode of the (ferrite + martensite (bainite)) dual phase microstructure. In contrast, one oil-quenched specimen with the 973 K- 20 mm condition, exhibited the discontinuous yielding (YR～ 0. 8), indicating that the microstructure basically consists of ferrite plus pearlite, {{as well as a}} relatively low UTS 660 MPa. The degree of deformation really occurring within materials, i. e., strain hardening seems to be enhanced with a decrease in deformation temperature. As the degree of deformation increases, the remaining austenite, not dynamically transformed to fine ferrite, becomes increasingly unstable. A lower hardenability of this remaining austenite thus would lead to a higher possibility to transform into the (ferrite + pearlite) structure of lower strength rather than the (ferrite + martensite (bainite)) of higher strength...|$|E

40|$|By {{utilizing}} the two-stream Maxwellian in Maxwell's integral equations of transfer {{we are able}} to find a closed-form solution of the problem of compressible plane Couette flow over the whole range of gas density from free molecule flow to atmospheric. The ratio of shear stress to the product of ordinary viscosity and velocity gradient, which is unity for a Newtonian fluid, here depends also on the gas density, the <b>plate</b> <b>temperatures</b> and the <b>plate</b> spacing. For example, this ratio decreases rapidly with increasing plate Mach number when the <b>plate</b> <b>temperatures</b> are fixed. On the other hand, at a fixed Mach number based on the <b>temperature</b> of one <b>plate,</b> this ratio approaches unity as the temperature of the other plate increases. Similar remarks can be made for the ratio of heat flux to the product of ordinary heat conduction coefficient and temperature gradient. The effect of gas density on the skin friction and heat transfer coefficients is described in terms of a single rarefaction parameter, which amounts to evaluating gas properties at a certain "kinetic temperature" defined in terms of plate Mach number and <b>plate</b> <b>temperature</b> ratio. One interesting result is the effect of <b>plate</b> <b>temperature</b> on velocity "slip". In the Navier-Stokes regime most of the gas follows the hot plate, because the gas viscosity is larger there.

In double pass air heater, the temperature of air at collector exit decreases at higher mass flow rate (75. 05 kg/hr).

40|$|Infrared cameras can {{directly}} {{measure the}} apparent temperature of objects, providing thermal imaging. However, the raw output from most infrared cameras {{suffers from a}} strong, often limiting noise source called nonuniformity. Manufacturing imperfections in infrared focal planes lead to high pixel-to-pixel sensitivity to electronic bias, focal plane temperature, and other effects. In turn, different pixels within the focal plane array give a drastically different electronic response to the same irradiance. The resulting imagery can only provide useful thermal imaging after a nonuniformity calibration has been performed. Traditionally, these calibrations are performed by momentarily blocking {{the field of view}} with a flat <b>temperature</b> <b>plate</b> or blackbody cavity. However because the pattern is a coupling of manufactured sensitivities with operational variations, periodic recalibration is required, sometimes on the order of tens of seconds. A class of computational methods called Scene-Based Nonuniformity Correction (SBNUC) has been researched for over 20 years where the nonuniformity calibration is estimated in digital processing by analysis of the video stream in the presence of camera motion. The most sophisticated SBNUC methods can completely and robustly eliminate the high-spatial frequency component of nonuniformity with only an initial reference calibration or potentially no physical calibration. I will demonstrate a novel algorithm that advances these SBNUC techniques to support all spatial frequencies of nonuniformity correction. Long-wave infrared microgrid polarimeters are a class of camera that incorporate a microscale per-pixel wire-grid polarizer directly affixed to each pixel of the focal plane. These cameras have the capability of simultaneously measuring thermal imagery and polarization in a robust integrated package with no moving parts.
