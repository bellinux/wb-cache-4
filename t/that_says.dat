5|$|Mulder goes {{to see the}} Shooter, despite Spender's objections. Mulder {{wants to}} give the Shooter {{immunity}} in exchange for testimony, which the Shooter refuses. Gibson proves his abilities {{to a group of}} clinicians while Scully and Fowley watch. The guard at the prison hands the Shooter a flattened Morley cigarette box <b>that</b> <b>says</b> he's a dead man. Scully visits the Lone Gunmen, wanting them to analyze the data from Gibson. She asks them who Diana is, and they tell her she worked closely with Mulder when he discovered the X-Files. The Smoking Man meets with Jeffrey in the FBI parking lot, but disappears when Mulder spots them talking. Scully and Mulder present to Skinner on Gibson, who displays extraordinary brain activities. Mulder believes that Gibson is the key to everything in the X-Files, and wants to make a deal with the Shooter. Diana and Skinner think this may result in adverse attention from the attorney general, and that the X-Files could be closed down if things go wrong, but Mulder dismisses that risk.|$|E

Weevil starts his new job as a Hearst janitor. Piz gets a job on a campus radio show, where he interviews both the feminists and the fraternity boys.

40|$|In the {{contemporary}} {{saga of the}} Greek/Eurozone (=Eurozone) crisis, there are basically four sorts of policy propositions. There are the ones <b>that</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Greece is helpless, that the Eurozone is a poor design and, thus, that Greece should default and the Eurozone should dissolve. There are those <b>that</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Greece is at a deadlock and thus it should indeed default – but inside the Eurozone, which should improve its governance and complete its integration (towards fiscal union). Then, there are those <b>that</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Greece is a sinner in an otherwise catholic Eurozone and should thus suffer (aka undergo an internal devaluation {{of as much as}} it takes) until it redeems itself (i. e., until it becomes competitive – whatever that means outside the virtual reality of economics textbooks). And then there are those discredited ones <b>that</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Greece has been in the wrong end of things {{and it needs to be}} supported within a programme of socio-institutional modernisation, capital deepening, economic restructuring and technological upgrading in order to increase its productivity in line with the (imaginary) “Eurozone average”...|$|R

25|$|A basic {{motivation}} {{of the theory}} is that projective modules (at least over certain commutative rings) are analogues of vector bundles. This can be made precise for the ring of continuous real-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff space, {{as well as for the}} ring of smooth functions on a smooth manifold (see Serre–Swan theorem <b>that</b> <b>says</b> a finitely generated projective module over the space of smooth functions on a compact manifold is the space of smooth sections of a smooth vector bundle).|$|E

The hall acquired its present-day common name in the Heian period, after a legend <b>that</b> <b>says</b> a Buddha arrived as Prince Shōtoku and meditated in a hall that existed here.

25|$|The {{superior}} courts {{from the}} provinces and territories are courts of inherent jurisdiction, {{which means that}} the jurisdiction of the superior courts is more than just what is conferred by statute. Following the principles of English common law, because the superior courts derive their authority from the Constitution, they can hear any matter unless there is a federal or provincial statute <b>that</b> <b>says</b> otherwise or that gives exclusive jurisdiction to some other court or tribunal. The doctrine of inherent jurisdiction gives superior courts greater freedom than statutory courts to be flexible and creative in the delivering of legal remedies and relief.|$|E

If no shadow is seen, legend says, spring will come early. In Germany, the tradition evolved into a myth that if the sun came out on Candlemas, a hedgehog would cast its shadow, predicting snow {{all the way into}} May. When German immigrants settled in Pennsylvania, they transferred the tradition onto local fauna, replacing hedgehogs with groundhogs.|$|E
