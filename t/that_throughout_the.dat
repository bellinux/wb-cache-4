5|$|In {{the section}} on sweets, David {{comments}} <b>that</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean countries, the more complicated sweets are very often bought from pâtisseries; the few recipes she gives are for simple, traditional sweets made at home, such as torrijas (also called pain perdu) and cold orange soufflé. The jams, chutneys and preserves section includes preserved melon alongside more familiar fruits such as pears and plums.|$|E
5|$|Raëlians believe <b>that</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> ages, {{members of}} the Elohim civilization sent {{different}} prophets, including Moses, Jesus, Buddha and many others whose role was to guide humanity and to prepare humans for the future, {{all of whom were}} created {{as a result of a}} sexual union between a human woman and one of the Elohim. To Raëlians, this was possible because the Elohim had advanced DNA synthesis and genetic engineering. The Elohim later reduced the frequent visits so that humans were largely left to progress on their own, until the time of the Apocalypse/Revelation when they would send their final messenger and disclose themselves at an extraterrestrial embassy, establishing political and economic ties.|$|E

5|$|A herbivore, the bohor reedbuck prefers {{grasses and}} tender reed shoots with high protein and low fiber content. This reedbuck is {{dependent}} on water, though green pastures can fulfill its water requirement. A study of the bohor reedbuck's diet in Rwenzori Mountains National Park (Uganda) revealed <b>that,</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> year, the most preferred species was Sporobolus consimilis. Other grasses the animals fed on included Hyparrhenia filipendula, Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, {{all of which are}} species commonly found in heavily grazed grasslands. Bohor reedbuck preferred Cynodon dactylon and Cenchrus ciliaris in the wet season, and switched to Sporobolus pyramidalis and Panicum repens in the dry season. Though they rarely feed on dicots, these can include Capparis and Sida species. On regularly burnt pastures, the bohor reedbuck feeds on Imperata species, while in places close by water sources, it eats Leersia and newly sprouted Vossia species (like topi and puku).|$|E

25|$|Although {{generally}} {{sympathetic to}} transhumanism, public health professor Gregory Stock is {{skeptical of the}} technical feasibility and mass appeal of the cyborgization of humanity predicted by Raymond Kurzweil, Hans Moravec and Kevin Warwick.

Primary changes to their own form and character would arise not from cyberware, but from the direct manipulation of their genetics, metabolism and biochemistry.|$|E

25|$|Another {{headache}} for NASL was {{competition from}} the resurgent Major Indoor Soccer League. The MISL began during the 1978–79 season, grew quickly, and by the early 1980s MISL was averaging over 8,000 fans per game. MISL's growth meant <b>that</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> early 1980s the NASL and the MISL engaged in a bidding war for U.S. based soccer players, putting further pressure on league salaries and heightening NASL's financial problems. In an effort to vie for MISL's expanding audiences, the NASL operated an indoor soccer league from 1979–80 to 1981–82 and in 1983–84.|$|E
25|$|To date, no archaeological {{remains of}} any longphort or wintersetl have been unearthed; nevertheless, the {{possibility}} that there was no actual encampment in this early period can be discounted. A wealth of contemporary documentary evidence serves to confirm <b>that</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> second half of the 9th century Viking Dublin was a successful and thriving settlement from which numerous raids were launched throughout the country. Furthermore, a succession of warlords – many of them claiming the title King of Dublin – made Dublin their principal power-base, and from there launched a series of military campaigns against enemies in Ireland, Britain and further afield.|$|E

25|$|Gaelic Irish {{society was}} also patrilineal, with land being {{primarily}} owned {{by men and}} inherited by the sons. Only when a man had no sons would his land pass to his daughters, and then only for their lifetimes. Upon their deaths, the land was redistributed among their father's male relations. Under Brehon law, rather than inheriting land, daughters had assigned to them {{a certain number of}} their father's cattle as their marriage-portion. It seems <b>that,</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages, the Gaelic Irish kept many of their marriage laws and traditions separate from those of the Church. Under Gaelic law, married women could hold property independent of their husbands, a link was maintained between married women and their own families, couples could easily divorce or separate, and men could have concubines (which could be lawfully bought). These laws differed from most of contemporary Europe and from Church law.|$|E
25|$|The Nambassa festivals {{were not}} only music and {{entertainment}} events but included educational components which sought to instruct people on lifestyle aids it felt important enough to promote within the then conservative society of New Zealand's 1970s. Many {{of those involved in}} Nambassa aspired to the notion <b>that</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> evolution of western civilisation, many valuable ancient survival, healing and spiritual techniques, had been lost over 1700 years of a philosophically and culturally dominating Roman Christianity. Nambassa advocates that many past civilisations supporting religious and political institutions, have historically sought to alienate, and too often violently eliminate, many worthwhile belief systems which did not conform to its then strict conservative doctrines on culture and religion. Adherents of Nambassa promote the ideology which suggests that, to deny what was once integral to survival in ancient history, is essentially to deny one's personal spiritual development. Through its wide variety of workshop subjects, the festivals attempted to nurture a better understanding of culture and spirituality with the goal of fostering a more tolerant and better informed society.|$|E
25|$|The 20th-century Reform rabbi {{and author}} Gunther Plaut argued that Isaac {{was not really}} deceived. Reading the story with close {{attention}} to the personality of Isaac, Plaut concluded <b>that</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> episode, Isaac was subconsciously aware of Jacob's identity, but, as he was unable to admit this knowledge, he pretended to be deceived. Plaut thus saw a plot within a plot, as Rebekah and Jacob laid elaborate plans for deceiving Isaac, while unknown to them Isaac looked for a way to deceive himself, in order to carry out God's design to bless his less-loved son. Plaut argued that Isaac was old but not senile. In his heart, Isaac had long known that Esau could not carry on the burden of Abraham and that, instead, he had to choose his quiet and complicated younger son Jacob. In Plaut's reading, weak and indecisive man and father that Isaac was, {{he did not have the}} courage to face Esau with the truth. His own blindness and Rebekah's ruse came literally as a godsend. Plaut noted that Isaac did not reprimand Jacob. Plaut concluded that no one, not even Esau, was deceived, for even Esau knew that Jacob was the chosen one.|$|E
