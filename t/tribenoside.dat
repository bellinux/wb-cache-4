40|$|Sugar chlorosulphates of furanoid and pyranoid {{derivatives}} bearing chlorosulphonyloxy {{groups at}} {{primary and secondary}} positions, were synthesized and examined mainly {{with a view to}} determine their extent of reactivity in terms of nucleophilic substitution reactions, especially with azide. Inversion of configuration occurred at reactive chiral centres, whereas intermediate azidosulphonyloxy derivatives (azidosulphates) were formed via S-Cℓ bond fission of the chlorosulphonyloxy group at less reactive primary or secondary centres, e. g. 1, 2 : 3, 4 -diO̲isopropyl idene-α-D-galactopyranose 6 -azidosulphate, 1, 2 -O̲isopropylidenea- D-xylofuranose 3 -azidosulphate and 1, 2 : 5, 6 -di-O̲-isopropyl idene-α-Dglucofuranose 3 -azidosulphate. 1, 2 : 3, 4 -Di-O̲-isopropylidene-α-Dgalactopyranose 6 -azidosulphate ultimately afforded the 6 -azidodeoxy derivative probably by an SN 2 mechanism. Some SNi characteristics were,however, evident when substitution occurred at a reactive primary centre (e. g. methyl 2, 3, 4 -tri-O̲-methyla- D-glucopyranoside 6 -chlorosulphate), as the 6 -azidodeoxy derivative obtained, appeared to be contaminated with a trace amount of the corresponding 6 -chlorodeoxy sugar, which had presumably formed via an internal SNi mechanism, while no intermediate azidosulphonyloxy derivative was isolated. In another study, the reaction pathways for the synthesis of benzylated chlorodeoxy sugars having potential biological properties as exemplified by the multivalent drug, <b>tribenoside,</b> were also investigate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A new liquid chromatographic (LC) {{method for}} {{simultaneous}} determination of lidocaine hydrochloride (LH) and <b>tribenoside</b> (TR) {{along with their}} related com-pounds in pharmaceutical preparations is described. Satis-factory LC separation of all analytes after the liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) procedure with ethanol was performed on a C 18 column using a gradient elution of a mixture of acetonitrile and 0. 1 % orthophosphoric acid as the mobile phase. The procedure was validated according to the ICH guidelines. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantifica-tion (LOQ) were 4. 36 and 13. 21 lg mL- 1 for LH, 7. 60 and 23. 04 lg mL- 1 for TR, and below 0. 11 and 0. 33 lg mL- 1 for their impurities, respectively. Intra- and inter-day pre-cision was below 1. 97 %, whereas accuracy for all analytes ranged from 98. 17 to 101. 94 %. The proposed method was sensitive, robust, and specific allowing reliable simulta-neous quantification of all mentioned compounds. More-over, a comparative study of the RP-LC column classification based on the quantitative structure-retention relationships (QSRR) and column selectivity obtained in real pharmaceutical analysis was innovatively applied using factor analysis (FA). In the column performance test, the analysis of LH and TR {{in the presence of}} their impu-rities was carried out according to the developed method with the use of 12 RP-LC stationary phases previously tested under the QSRR conditions. The obtained results confirmed that the classes of the stationary phases selected in accordance with the QSRR models provided comparable separation for LH, TR, and their impurities. Hence, it was concluded that the proposed QSRR approach could be considered a supportive tool in the selection of the suitable column for the pharmaceutical analysis...|$|E
