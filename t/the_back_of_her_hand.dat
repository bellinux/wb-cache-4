500|$|During the {{rehearsal}} for that evening, Julie and Steve {{learn that the}} town sheriff is coming to arrest them. Steve takes out a large pocket knife and makes a cut on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> sucking the blood and swallowing it. Pete returns with the sheriff, who insists that the show cannot proceed, because Julie is a mulatto woman married to a white man, and local laws prohibit such miscegenation. Julie admits {{that her mother was}} black, but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has [...] "black blood" [...] in him, so their marriage is legal in Mississippi. The troupe backs him up, boosted by the ship's pilot Windy McClain, a longtime friend of the sheriff. The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation, but they still have to leave the show boat; identified as black, they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience. Cap'n Andy fires Pete, but in spite of his sympathy for Julie and Steve, he cannot violate the law for them.|$|E
2500|$|Springfield {{was raised}} in a music-loving family. Her father would tap out rhythms on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and {{encourage}} her to guess the musical piece. She listened {{to a wide range of}} music, including George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hart, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and Glenn Miller. A fan of American jazz and the vocalists Peggy Lee and Jo Stafford, she wished to sound like them. At the age of twelve, she made a recording of herself performing the Irving Berlin song [...] "When the Midnight Choo Choo Leaves for Alabam" [...] at a local record shop in Ealing.|$|E

60|$|Mrs Verloc touched <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair. It was {{in perfect}} order.|$|R
60|$|With <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> Thyme {{rubbed off}} the kiss. The two cousins walked out amongst the traffic.|$|E
60|$|And {{he looked}} with such deferential and shining eyes at his {{companion}} that she placed <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> before her mouth, and her breast rose.|$|E
6000|$|She put her {{forehead}} down on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and laughed again. [...] "You {{ought to be}} photographed. You look {{as if you were}} sitting for it." ...|$|E
50|$|Mabel Paige {{was cast}} off <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> success in Young and Willing.|$|R
60|$|The doctor came behind her, and put {{his hand}} on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> chair.|$|R
60|$|She tossed over <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> chair an {{envelope}} to Thatcher. He opened it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shut up, Jesse!" [...] {{my mother}} cried, landing <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> stingingly on my mouth. And then, to the stranger, [...] "Go away {{and let the}} boy alone." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{raised her}} head from her arms and dried her eyes with <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> like a child. A kinder note than he had {{intended}} went into his voice.|$|E
60|$|She was {{watching}} {{him all the time}} with her dark, dilated, inchoate eyes. She leaned forward and swung round her arm, catching him a light blow on the face with <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mary turned <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father's hand to {{her lips}} and smiled at him.|$|R
60|$|Sydney Barnes {{leaned over}} <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> chair. His hot whisper seemed to burn her cheek.|$|R

6000|$|In the {{presence}} of old Angus Craig and young Johnson they were married, and when the minister gave Mrs. Bidwell a rousing smack she wiped her lips with <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and said to Bidwell: ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Davenant got {{up again}} and went to her; drawing off her glove she felt her cheek with <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> 'You are ill, {{you are in a}} fever. I'm sure that {{whatever}} you said it was very charming.' ...|$|E
60|$|Her father, {{his thumbs}} in the armholes of his {{waistcoat}} {{and his legs}} far apart, {{looked at her in}} blank and speechless amazement; her mother, with more consideration but equal lack of sympathy, patted her gently on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|Miss Ophelia {{rose from}} this {{encouraging}} colloquy; St. Clare was leaning over <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> chair.|$|R
60|$|It reached nearly {{down to her}} knees, and {{the high}} collar {{concealed}} <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head effectually.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Modern dance - {{a female}} dancer {{performs}} a leg split while balanced on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> partner ...|$|R
60|$|VIVIE [unmoved] Be quiet. Some {{one will}} answer the bell. [Without flinching a step she strikes the bell with <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> It clangs harshly; {{and he starts}} back involuntarily. Almost {{immediately}} Frank appears at the porch with his rifle].|$|E
60|$|Miss Carver now {{stopped her}} work, and looked from her friend, {{with her head}} bowed in {{laughter}} on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> to that of Berry bent in burlesque reproach upon her, and then at Lemuel, {{who was trying to}} control himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{come home}} with pleasure," [...] Rochester interrupted. [...] "Don't look so scared," [...] he added, patting <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> gently. [...] "You know very well, {{if there is any}} little trouble, I shall be delighted to help you out." ...|$|E
60|$|She smelled him of drink, {{felt the}} unequal pull of his swaying grasp on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> rocking-chair.|$|R
60|$|A gaunt old woman, {{who wore}} a dark green-check sunbonnet hanging at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head, put in a word.|$|R
60|$|After which strong avowal Bella {{underwent}} reaction, {{and cried}} to any extent, with <b>her</b> face on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> chair.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, you brave man! God bless you!' He stooped {{suddenly}} and impulsively kissed <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> lightly and was gone. For a fleeting {{moment she was}} angry. No man had kissed her hand before; {{but the thought of}} his liberty was swept away by another: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said she, [...] "but I've {{had pretty}} hard times since I left home, Hi." [...] The tears sprang {{to her eyes}} at the {{recollection}} of her troubles, but she only wiped them hastily away with <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> without stopping in her eating.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{took out}} the roll of tobacco, took a whiff, and gave the old woman some snuff on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Then she was so delighted that she began to dance, and the man got leave to stay all night. It {{was not long before}} he began to ask about Farmer Weatherbeard.|$|E
60|$|And while Gyp {{passed her}} hand down those iron legs, the old mare {{examined}} <b>her</b> down <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck.|$|R
60|$|She laughed to herself--a low, terrible laugh, which startled {{even the}} doctor into taking his hand off <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> chair.|$|R
60|$|Catherine {{sat down}} with massive calm. Anjou {{remained}} standing beside and slightly behind <b>her,</b> leaning upon <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> tall chair.|$|R
