500|$|In The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway {{contrasts}} Paris with Pamplona, and {{the frenzy}} of the fiesta with the tranquillity of the Spanish countryside. [...] Spain was Hemingway's favorite European country; he considered it a healthy place, and the only country [...] "that hasn't been shot to pieces." [...] He was profoundly affected by the spectacle of bullfighting, writing, It isn't just brutal like they always told us. It's a great tragedy—and {{the most beautiful thing}} I've ever seen and takes more guts and skill and guts again than anything possibly could. It's just like having a ringside seat at the war with nothing going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> He demonstrated what he considered the purity in the culture of bullfighting—called afición—and presented it as an authentic way of life, contrasted against the inauthenticity of the Parisian bohemians. To be accepted as an [...] aficionado was rare for a non-Spaniard; Jake goes through a difficult process to gain acceptance by the [...] "fellowship of afición." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ruslan Obiang, {{a son of}} the President, is Equatorial Guinea's sports {{minister}} and president of a top soccer club, the [...] "Panthers". He has lived in Spain, where he encouraged firms {{to do business in}} his country. Several Spanish businessmen have complained about the consequences of these deals. One Spaniard who had paid $200,000 to secure a contract to build soccer stadiums described a system that involved bribes at every turn. After paying bribes for years, however, his deal eventually fell apart when he refused to pay any more in bribes to Ruslan Obiang and his associates. The businessman was critical of business in the country, saying officials exploit as much money as possible until moving on to another contractor. The businessman also noted that he had been threatened on several occasions, both with violence, and trumped-up rape charges that could have resulted in him being imprisoned. His report claimed that there is no avenue for justice in the nation, since [...] "he corruption is absolute and endemic; there is nobody you can turn to." [...] After the deal collapsed, one of his business partners was visited at his Portugal home by men in dark suits who staked outside his home for several days as a threat and then visited him in his office. Herein they warned him that if he reported his story to the media or any authorities there would be consequences. He concluded: [...] "You sign a contract with the son of the president and you believe it is worth something. You have no idea what is going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> We had to flee the country. We were afraid for our lives." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My {{grandmother}} was a gypsy," [...] he ses, [...] "and it's in the family. Things {{that are going}} <b>to</b> <b>'appen</b> <b>to</b> people I know come to me in dreams, same as pore Bill's did. It's curious to me sometimes when I look round at you chaps, seeing you going about 'appy and comfortable, and knowing all the time 'orrible things that is going <b>to</b> <b>'appen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Sometimes it gives me the fair shivers." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS O'FLAHERTY [tottering to {{the garden}} seat and showing signs of {{breaking}} down]. Dinny darlint, why are <b>you</b> like this <b>to</b> me? What's <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{can tell}} futures," [...] {{answered}} the Story Girl mysteriously. [...] "I know what's going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> all of <b>you.</b> Shall I tell you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, it's rank sorcery!" [...] exclaimed Tom, {{who was now}} {{becoming}} very much interested. [...] "And how did they make out with what was going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in the future?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come and walk," [...] he said, soothingly. [...] "And try to calm yourself. There {{is no need}} {{to become}} excited or alarmed. Nothing is going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> One night is like another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are Sir John Foterell's only child, are you not, who allege {{yourself}} to be wife to Sir Christopher Harflete, or so says yonder Prioress? Now, what was about <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and why?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've sure got {{a case of}} happenedicitis," [...] said Poky Rodgers, fency rider of the Largo Verde /potrero/. [...] "Somebody ought <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> give <b>you</b> a {{knock on}} the head with the butt end of a quirt. I've rode in nine miles for some tobacco; and it don't appear natural and seemly that <b>you</b> ought <b>to</b> be allowed to live." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, {{by virtue}} of my rights and authority, I will take her by force, Christopher Harflete, and if harm should <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> now or hereafter, on your own head be it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's enough." [...] He, however, {{remained}} looking curiously at Morse. [...] "Did {{you never}} hear," [...] he said, with a singular smile, [...] "that {{it was about}} the meanest kind of luck that could <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> save a drowning man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's YOU, if I may respectfully, ecstatically say so, who are different. That's {{the point}} of it all. I'm not sure that {{anything}} so terrible really ought <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> as to know us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{be careful}} of where you go," [...] cautioned old Benson. [...] "These caves are full of pitfalls, and now you two boys are with me I don't want {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> If something did happen, neither Captain Moore nor Colonel Fairfield would forgive me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I suppose it's troublesome. Still ... <b>you</b> see, {{nothing ever}} <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> me. When I {{was a little}} boy I never had accidents. I never fell in love as I grew up. Never married... I wonder how it feels <b>to</b> have {{something}} <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> something really remarkable.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't understand," [...] said Benham with {{a gesture}} of resignation. [...] "It {{seems to me that}} if a man and woman love each other--well, they insist upon each other. What is <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> her if <b>you</b> leave her in Moscow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not wanting}} <b>to</b> dictate <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> lad," [...] Charley said, [...] "but I'm very much against your making a last raid. You've gone safely through rough times with rough men, {{and it would}} be a shame <b>to</b> have {{something}} <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> at the very end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's no use {{sitting there}} saying [...] "Oh, no!" [...] I {{can see you}} at it. The fact is, you're such an infernally good chap that {{something}} of this sort was bound <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> sooner or later. I think making you his heir was the only sensible thing old Nutcombe ever did. In his place I'd have done the same.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not sure," [...] she {{answered}} frankly. [...] "Sometimes I am almost terrified and would {{give anything to}} hear that you were on your way home. And at other times I realise that you are really very clever, that nothing is likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and that the place will seem duller than ever when you do go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not very well, Mr. Quatermain," [...] he answered. [...] "The fact is," [...] {{he added}} with a burst of confidence, [...] "I feel queerly about you all. The Kaffirs {{have told me that}} {{something}} is going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and I think you ought to know it. I daren't say any more," [...] and he vanished into the crowd.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Who {{authorised}} <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{decide whether}} the will was thrown away on [...] purpose, or mislaid by accident? Has it never <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do [...] such a thing, and to find {{at the bottom of}} a chest some valuable [...] paper that you had tossed there inadvertently?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} {{acknowledge}} certain things it will save us all much time, of which at present {{we have little}} to spare. Those things are that knowing what was going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> the commission, <b>you</b> tried <b>to</b> avoid accompanying it. Is that true?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be easy, now. One {{thing at}} a time. Your back's taking no harm at all for the present, since I've covered it up. I'm wanting <b>to</b> know what's <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> D' ye {{think we can do}} without a {{navigator}} that ye go and provoke that beast Bishop until he all but kills you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{the way you}} did feel? Well, it {{was very}} simple. You said you had had from your {{earliest}} time, as the deepest thing within you, the sense of being kept for something rare and strange, possibly prodigious and terrible, that was sooner or later <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> that you had in your bones the foreboding and the conviction of, and that would perhaps overwhelm you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{but not to}} take a {{share in}} doing it. Well, pray be careful. Were {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> I should know it was because you had punished the man who spoke so insultingly about me. You are not {{like most of the}} others; you call me miss, and you try to speak roughly, but I know that it is not natural to you, and that you have been a gentleman.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} be ashamed of yourself, Sam Dickson," [...] his wife said, wrathfully. [...] "The boy means what he says, and I believe him. If {{anything}} was <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and that boy was growed up, I believe he would come forward to lend me a helping hand, just as he says, as if he were my son. The gals is good gals, but gals in service have plenty to do with their wages--what with dress, and one thing or another. We must never look for much help from them but, if Bill is doing well, and I ever come to want, I believe as his heart would be good to help, a bit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Uncle Sylvester coolly. [...] "But {{because it}} don't <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> belong <b>to</b> <b>YOU</b> at all! According {{to the paper}} I have in my pocket, which is about as legal a {{document}} as I ever saw, it is father's free gift to Miss Marie du Page." ...|$|R
500|$|Zappa {{stated that}} he tried smoking {{cannabis}} ten times, but without any pleasure or result beyond sleepiness and sore throat, and [...] "never used LSD, never used cocaine, never used heroin {{or any of that}} other stuff."

[...] He was a regular tobacco smoker for most of his life, and strongly critical of anti-tobacco campaigns.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see {{why that}} {{puts him in}} bad," [...] said John wonderingly. [...] "You don't {{construct}} your stories well, Pugsy. You start at the end, then go back <b>to</b> any part which <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> appeal <b>to</b> <b>you</b> at the moment, and eventually wind up at the beginning. Why is this kid in bad because his father has come {{to work on the}} subway?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O my {{most beloved}} father, mother, and other relatives, have no fear. Though things look very black, {{remember}} {{the vision of}} the holy Tanofir, who doubtless allows these things <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> to try your faith by direct order of the gods. Be sure that I will not leave you to perish, or if there should be no escape, that I {{will find a way to}} put you out of your misery and to avenge you. Yes, yes, I will yet see that accursed swine, Houman, take your place in this boat. Now I go to the Court to which it seems that this gold chain gives me a right of entry, or so the eunuch says, but soon I will be back again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But look here, Dave," [...] said Tom, [...] "you {{used to tell}} people's fortunes, too, {{when you}} took their finger marks. Dave's just an all-round genius--a genius of the first water, gentlemen; a great {{scientist}} running to seed here in this village, a prophet {{with the kind of}} honor that prophets generally get at home--for here they don't give shucks for his scientifics, and they call his skull a notion factory--hey, Dave, ain't it so? But never mind, he'll make his mark someday--finger mark, you know, he-he! But really, you want to let him take a shy at your palms once; it's worth twice the price of admission or your money's returned at the door. Why, he'll read your wrinkles as easy as a book, and not only tell you fifty or sixty things that's going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> but fifty or sixty thousand that ain't. Come, Dave, show the gentlemen what an inspired jack-at-all-science we've got in this town, and don't know it." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{would take}} the whole year through, my friend, to show you all {{that it has to}} do with you and your unhappiness. All the Lessons, Epistles, and Gospels of the year are set out to show you what {{it has to do with}} you. But in the meanwhile, before Christmas-day comes, {{consider}} this one thing: Why are you anxious? Because you do not know what is <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> Then Christmas-day is a witness to you, that whatsoever happens to you, happens to you by the will and rule of Jesus Christ, The perfect man; think of that. THE PERFECT MAN--who understands men's hearts and wants, and all that is good for them, and has all the wisdom and power to give us what is good, which we want ourselves. And what makes you unhappy, my friends? Is it not at heart just this one thing--you are unhappy because you are not pleased with yourselves? And you are not pleased with yourselves because you know you ought not to be pleased with yourselves; and you know you ought not to be pleased with yourselves, because you know, in the bottom of your hearts, that God is not pleased with you? What cure, what comfort for such thoughts can we find?--This.|$|E

I mean, I've been doing it for 12 years. But the last four to five years, it's been an amazing thing to live through and <b>to</b> see <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and <b>to</b> see your fan base grow to a point where it's unbelievable {{to stand in front of}} that microphone every night and see how passionate they are about your music. ... More importantly, how much fun they're having with it ... out in the parking lots before the show and during the show. It's everything I ever dreamed of and more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor I," [...] agreed Psmith. [...] "Your narratives, Comrade Maloney, {{always seem}} to me to suffer from a certain lack of construction. You start at the end, and then <b>you</b> go back <b>to</b> any portion of the story which <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> appeal <b>to</b> <b>you</b> at the moment, {{eventually}} winding up at the beginning.

6000|$|... "Exactly, but {{the curious}} {{part of the}} affair is that, up to the present, Mr. Sydney Barnes {{has been unable to}} {{discover}} the slightest trace of any investments or any sum of money whatever.
