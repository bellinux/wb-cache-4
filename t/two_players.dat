Mario Kart GP is the same as in single player, the only difference being that there are now two human controlled and six computer-controlled drivers. Match Race involves the <b>two</b> <b>players</b> going head to head on a track of their choice without any opponents. In Battle Mode, the <b>two</b> <b>players</b> again go head to head, but this time in one of four dedicated Battle Mode courses. Each player starts with three balloons around their kart which can be popped by power-ups fired by the other player. The first player to have all three of their balloons popped loses.|$|E

5|$|The game also {{provides}} a co-operative mode where <b>two</b> <b>players</b> may play through the game's campaign together via split-screen, system link, or through the Xbox Live online service.

Additionally, in certain missions, the second player can occasionally start {{far away from the}} main player and takes over an allied character that was AI-controlled in the single player campaign.
