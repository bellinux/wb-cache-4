5|$|On 21 November 1922, the LER {{announced}} {{a bill for}} the 1923 parliamentary session. It included <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> extend the line from its southern terminus to the C's station at Kennington where an interchange would be provided. The bill received royal assent as the London Electric Railway Act, 1923 on 2 August 1923.|$|E
5|$|The City of London had few open spaces, and <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> {{build on}} {{the north of the}} park was {{extremely}} unpopular with local residents, workers and social reformers. Henry Fitzalan-Howard, the Postmaster-General, persuaded the Government to contribute £5,000 towards the cost, and the clergy of St Botolph's Aldersgate launched an appeal in The Times for the remaining funds.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Election Commission would {{review the}} postal voting system where EC {{chairman}} Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Mohd Yusof {{said they would}} study <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> call for an early voting session for army personnel, policemen and EC staff instead of posting votes. Nevertheless, the Youth wing of PAS have demanded for the postal votes to be abolished altogether as it claims that the postal votes are no longer relevant and is prone to abuse and exploitation {{by the government to}} their benefit.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> {{president}} greater powers sparked {{protests in}} Bamako on 2 July {{prior to a}} visit by French President Emmanuel Macron.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the referendums, the quorum {{required}} for a <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> be approved was reduced from 32% to 25%, meaning that 8,398 voters had to vote in favour for <b>the</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>to</b> be approved.|$|R
5|$|In the Soviet Union {{during the}} 1950s, {{the head of}} KGB, Alexander Shelepin, {{proposed}} and carried out the destruction of many documents related to the Katyn massacre {{in order to minimize}} the chance that the truth would be revealed. His 3 March 1959 note to Nikita Khrushchev, with information about the execution of 21,857 Poles and with <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> destroy their personal files, became one of the documents that were preserved and eventually made public.|$|E
5|$|The delegates couldn't {{agree on}} whether the {{executive}} should be a single person, or a board of three. Many wished to limit {{the power of the}} executive and thus supported <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> divide the executive power between three persons. The possible problems of this system, in addition to the knowledge that George Washington would probably be the first president, calmed the fears enough so that the proponents of a singular executive could accumulate a large coalition. This issue came up occasionally after the matter was settled, but was never again seriously doubted.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> {{establish}} a fellowship of King's was first considered in 1847. John Allen, a former chaplain of King's, {{was the first}} FKC. Each fellow had to pay two guineas for the fellowship privilege initially, but the fee was ceased from 1850. A wide variety of people were elected as fellows of King's, including former principal Alfred Barry, former King’s student then professor Thorold Rogers, architect William Burges and ornithologist Robert Swinhoe. The first women fellows were elected in 1904. Lilian Faithfull, vice-principal of the King’s Ladies’ Department from 1894 to 1906, {{was one of the}} first women fellows.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>to</b> make Burton upon Trent and Worcester into non-county boroughs {{were not}} {{implemented}} : Burton {{had brought a}} court case challenging the action.|$|R
50|$|The Scottish Government {{has said}} it {{supports}} <b>the</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>to</b> bring an independent stock exchange back to Edinburgh, which is the 4th largest financial centre in Europe.|$|R
50|$|A 26-part {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held in}} the Federated States of Micronesia on 2 July 1991. Only four of <b>the</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>to</b> amend <b>the</b> constitution were approved by voters.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> extend SR 125 {{north into}} Poway was {{discussed}} {{as late as}} 2003 by a local advisory group working with the San Diego Association of Governments. The City of Poway opposed the plan in 2001, saying that SR 67 should be improved instead; it {{had been removed from}} city plans in 1980. None of these proposals to extend SR 125 have been included in SANDAG's 2050 Regional Transportation Plan.|$|E
5|$|With {{relations}} between the MR and the LNWR deteriorating, Watkin {{turned his attention to}} <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> link to Aylesbury. Negotiations between the A and the GWR had broken down, and Watkin seized an opportunity to agree running rights over the A's route north from Aylesbury, taking over the line completely in 1891. In 1888 work began on the extension to Aylesbury.|$|E
5|$|A man of {{progressive}} and relatively liberal ideas, Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, {{he had a}} special interest in applying science and art to the manufacturing industry. The Great Exhibition of 1851 arose from the annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert {{served as president of the}} Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and had to fight for every stage of the project. In the House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> hold the exhibition in Hyde Park. Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy their faith. Albert thought such talk absurd and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>to</b> form {{this group}} and issue its shares {{to the public}} were {{announced}} on 27 November 1919, during London's Olympia Motor Show, the first show since the Armistice.|$|R
5000|$|Toro Energy {{submitted}} {{a referral to}} the WA and Federal Government in 2014 to include the Lake Maitland and Millipede deposits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> existing <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> mine Lake Way and Centipede. <b>The</b> <b>proposal</b> is <b>to</b> now to mine 4 deposits across 2 lake systems.|$|R
50|$|In {{order for}} <b>the</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>to</b> be approved, a quorum {{of at least}} 25% of {{registered}} voters voting in favour had to be reached, together with a majority of valid votes in favour.|$|R
5|$|A {{year after}} his death at Stamford Bridge, Harald's body was moved to Norway and buried at the Mary Church in Nidaros (Trondheim). About a hundred years after his burial, his body was reinterred at the Helgeseter Priory, which was {{demolished}} in the 17th century. On 25 September 2006, the 940th anniversary of Harald's death, the newspaper Aftenposten published {{an article on the}} poor state of Norway's ancient royal burial sites, including that of Harald, which is reportedly located underneath a road built across the monastery site. In a follow-up article on 26 September, the Municipality of Trondheim revealed they would be examining the possibility of exhuming the king and reinterring him in Nidaros Cathedral, currently the burial place of nine Norwegian kings, among them Magnus the Good and Magnus Haraldsson, Harald's predecessor and successor respectively. A month later it was reported that <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> exhume the king had been scrapped.|$|E
5|$|After Maryland {{suffered}} a fifth {{loss in the}} season closer against Boston College, it was very unlikely that the team's preferred postseason game, the Meineke Car Care Bowl, would extend an invitation. The game's selection committee in Charlotte, North Carolina was eager to secure nearby North Carolina (8–4). Meanwhile, the EagleBank Bowl, hosted by RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., {{not far from the}} Maryland campus, secured in-state rival Navy, but the game date conflicted with Maryland's final exams. Soon after Maryland's regular season finale, sportswriters and analysts speculated that the Humanitarian Bowl in Boise, Idaho, was the most likely postseason destination. Bowl officials there worked to secure a game of undefeated teams between the hometown team, Boise State, and Ball State of the Mid-American Conference. However, Ball State rejected <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> play at Boise State's homefield as unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|As Han troops {{returned}} from the Han–Nanyue War in 111 BC, the Han government debated annexing Dongyue. Dongyue, under King Zou Yushan, had agreed to assist the Han campaign against Nanyue, but the Dongyue army never reached Nanyue. Yushan blamed the delay on the weather. <b>The</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> annex Dongyue was suggested by General Yang Pu, but was dismissed by Emperor Wu. The naval force arrived home without having attacked Dongyue. Zou caught wind of Yang's request, and responded by revolting against the Han. Han forces were led by General Han Yue, General Yang Pu, commander Wang Wenshu, and two marquises of Yue ancestry. The army crushed the rebellion and captured Dongyue in {{the last months of}} 111 BC, placing the former Minyue territory under Han rule.|$|E
50|$|The {{referendum}} was classed as {{an optional}} referendum, {{which meant that}} only {{a majority of the}} public vote was required for <b>the</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>to</b> be approve, as opposed to the mandatory referendums that required both a majority of voters and cantons <b>to</b> approve <b>the</b> <b>proposals.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{proposed}} reorganisation {{of local}} government was a legislative initiative passed by a 75% majority {{in both houses of}} the Legislature. As a result, only a simply majority of votes was required for <b>the</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>to</b> pass.|$|R
5|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} {{that the use}} of explicit-constant definitions of the unit being defined that are not related to an example of its quantity will have many adverse effects. Although this criticism applies to the proposed linking of the kilogram to the Planck constant via a route that requires a knowledge of both special relativity and quantum mechanics, it does not apply to the proposed definition of the ampere, which is closer to an example of its quantity than is the current definition. Some observers have welcomed <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> base the definition of electric current on the charge of the electron rather than the current definition of a force between two parallel current-carrying wires – since the nature of the electromagnetic interaction between two bodies at the quantum electrodynamics level is somewhat different from the nature at classical electrodynamic levels, it is considered inappropriate to use classical electrodynamics to define quantities that exist at quantum electrodynamic levels.|$|E
5|$|Divya is a free-spirited {{college student}} from a {{conservative}} family whose strict father, Chandramouli, {{works for the}} government. She learns that her parents are eagerly awaiting a marriage proposal for her. Unwilling to get married, and hoping that the groom's family will reject her, she deliberately arrives home late to find Chandrakumar (the groom) and his family patiently waiting for her. She talks arrogantly to Chandrakumar to make him dislike her but, undeterred, {{he says that he}} likes her and agrees to the marriage. Divya initially refuses, but when her father has a heart attack her family begs her to accept <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> aid his recovery. Succumbing to the pressure, Divya marries Chandrakumar.|$|E
5|$|Following {{that the}} Allied {{offensive}} continued {{for the next}} four months, right up {{until the end of the}} war. During the Second Battle of the Somme the Australian Corps fought actions at Lihons, Etinehem, Proyart, Chuignes, and Mont St Quentin, before taking part in their final engagement of the war on 5 October 1918 at Montbrehain. Australian casualties during these battles were very high and coupled with the drying up of reinforcements from Australia, the rejection of <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> introduce conscription and the granting of home leave to men who been serving since 1914 meant that by the end of the war the AIF was severely stretched to the limit. Consequently, during the height of the offensive it was decided to disband three battalions—the 36th, 47th and 52nd—in order to reinforce other units.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} 2010–11 Seahawks-Saints playoff game, McKay wanted <b>to</b> revisit <b>the</b> {{previous}} <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> reseed teams during wild-card weekend. However, sportswriter Peter King {{wrote that he}} believed league owners were still hesitant on implementing any such changes at this time due to the then-pending 2011 work stoppage, <b>the</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>to</b> extend <b>the</b> regular season from 16 to 18 games {{and how it will}} impact the postseason, and the simple fact that not enough teams have been seriously disadvantaged by the current format.|$|R

5|$|From 1 July 1965, Oslo Sporveier {{took over}} the {{operation}} of the Ekeberg Line, which was numbered Line 16. Oslo Sporveier took over all employees and rolling stock, but Ekebergbanen remained a holding and real estate company. Immediately following the take-over, Oslo Sporveier introduced a 20-minute headway and suggested that the line be closed and replaced by buses from 29 October 1967, when the Østensjø Line of the metro opened. Following the closing of Sagene Ring, there were increased protests against closing the tramway. Traffic had decreased on the Ekeberg Line, but proponents for keeping it stated that this was because Oslo Sporveier had reduced the frequency and moved the end station out of the core of the city center. When <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> close the Ekeberg Line was considered by the city council, it was decided that only the Simenbråten Line was to be closed.|$|E
5|$|His third book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) {{entitled}} The FairTax Book, explains <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> {{implement a}} national retail sales tax {{in lieu of}} the federal income taxes, payroll taxes, estate tax, etc. The hardcover version held the #1 non-fiction spot on the New York Times bestseller list for the last two weeks of August 2005 and remained in the top ten for seven weeks. The paperback released in May 2006 contains additional information, an afterword and several revisions of misstatements made in the hardcover edition. It also spent several weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Boortz claims to have donated 100% of his royalties from the FairTax book to charity and has commented on his radio show that he has not made one cent from the book. As of July 2006, Boortz claims his charitable donations from book proceeds exceed one hundred thousand US dollars. The book is one of his most frequent topics of discussion.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{two nations}} were still working at cross-purposes. The British saw the IRBMs as a step {{on the path to}} an {{independent}} nuclear deterrent, while the Americans saw it as an augmentation of the Strategic Air Command (SAC). The Americans originally envisaged the employment of 120 Thor missiles in four USAF squadrons, the 672nd, 673rd, 674th and 675th Strategic Missile Squadrons, and four RAF squadrons, the first two of which would at first be manned by USAF personnel. The October 1957 Sputnik crisis caused this plan to be modified. It placed the Eisenhower administration under great public pressure to act on the deployment of missiles by a shocked and distraught nation. Sputnik demonstrated the Soviet Union's capability to deploy ICBMs. The United States now needed the IRBMs—and British cooperation—more than ever. <b>The</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> base USAF Thor squadrons in Britain was dropped on 12 October 1957.|$|E
50|$|The referendums on {{epidemics}} and {{the constitution}} were optional referendums, which meant that only {{a majority of the}} public vote was required for <b>the</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>to</b> be approved. <b>The</b> referendum on copyright law was a mandatory referendum, which required both a majority of voters and cantons <b>to</b> approve <b>the</b> <b>proposals.</b>|$|R
