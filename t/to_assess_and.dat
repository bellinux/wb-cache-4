5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Lee learned that Venerable Tao Chiai wanted {{to restore a}} {{dilapidated}} Chinese temple in Sarnath (the deer park where the Buddha gave his first sermon after his enlightenment) that a Chinese emperor of the Tang Dynasty built in the 8th century AD. Venerable Tao Chiai died before he could accomplish this task; however, his chief disciple, Venerable Teh Yue, continued the restoration project, which Lee personally funded. Lee went {{on a pilgrimage to}} India with Venerable Teh Yue and brought along an English engineer, A. H. King, <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>and</b> assist the restoration works. This temple still stands today in Sarnath and is called simply The Chinese Temple in Sarnath.|$|E

The initial presentation varies according to the child's developmental and chronological age, although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction.

Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with malnutrition or dehydration, while serum growth hormone levels will be normal or elevated.|$|E
5|$|When Missouri {{became a}} state in 1821, St. Louis County was created from the {{boundaries}} of the former St. Louis subdistrict of the Missouri Territory; St. Louis city existed within the county but was not coterminous with it. Starting in the 1850s, rural county voters began to exert political influence over questions of taxation in the St. Louis County court. In 1867, the county court was given power <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>and</b> collect property tax revenue from St. Louis city property, providing a financial boon to the county government while depriving city government of revenues. After this power transfer, St. Louisans in the city began to favor one of three options: greater representation on the county court via charter changes, citycounty consolidation, or urban secession to form an independent city.|$|E

25|$|The Sarbanes–Oxley Act {{has been}} praised for {{nurturing}} an ethical culture as it forces top management to be transparent and employees {{to be responsible}} for their acts whilst protecting whistleblowers.

Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of each product. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{stimulant}} and non-stimulant medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD. The most commonly used stimulant medications include methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta), mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), and lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse). Non-stimulant medications with a specific indication for ADHD include atomoxetine (Strattera), guanfacine (Intuniv), and clonidine (Kapvay). Other medicines which may be prescribed off-label include bupropion (Wellbutrin), tricyclic antidepressants, SNRIs, or MAOIs. The presence of comorbid (co-occurring) disorders can make finding the right treatment and diagnosis much more complicated, costly, and time-consuming. So it is recommended <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>and</b> simultaneously treat any comorbid disorders.|$|E
