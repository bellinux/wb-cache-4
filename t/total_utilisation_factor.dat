40|$|In a joint Nordic {{research}} – Nordic Thermal Mass – it {{was compared}} calculation results for energy need obtained with six simulation programs and one program {{based on the}} monthly energy balance method of EN 832. The level of complexity of these programs was different. The calculations were made for a single-family house and for an apartment flat fulfilling the Finnish building regulations and using the weather data of Helsinki. The inaccuracy in the calculated needs for heating energy approximately was 5 kWh/m 2 /a (8 %). In the cooling energy the inaccuracy was much higher, 5 kWh/m 2 /a (50 %) for the single-family house and 20 kWh/m 2 /a (45 %) for the apartment flat. The monthly energy balance method ISO FDIS 13790 gives accurate results for heating energy when the building’s time constant is at least approximately 50 h.

40|$|As a {{transmission}} control protocol (TCP) implementation imposes the sources with small round trip time (RTT) to allocate the bottleneck unfairly, an adaptive congestion control is necessary to avoid packet loss along with fairness. The main idea {{of this paper is}} to design an adaptive rate-based queue management scheme based on gradient projection method and internal model control for network sources with different RTT values. The goal is to achieve weighted fairness, maximum utilisation and compatibility with both large and small RTTs. The communication network consisting of a bottleneck link and N TCP sources is considered as a multi-input single-output system. In the proposed approach, the number of the active TCP sources is determined adaptively and the <b>utilisation</b> <b>factors</b> are updated. For this purpose, the gradient method is used to design the adaptation rule for the <b>utilisation</b> <b>factors</b> in order to obtain weighted fairness, and then the projection method is augmented with the gradient procedure to achieve maximum bottleneck utilisation.

Both methods have a similar structure, but the Hungarian method contains several simplifications.

The objectives of this study are to develop profiles based on both the diabetes-related healthcare <b>utilisation</b> and <b>total</b> healthcare <b>utilisation</b> in primary care, to investigate which patient and disease characteristics determine ‘membership’ of each profile, and to investigate the association between these profiles. Methods Data were used from electronic medical records of 6721 known type II diabetes patients listed in 48 Dutch general practices. Latent Class Analyses were conducted to identify profiles of healthcare and regression analyses were used to analyse the characteristics of the profiles. Results For both diabetes-related healthcare <b>utilisation</b> and <b>total</b> healthcare <b>utilisation</b> three profiles could be distinguished: for the diabetes-related healthcare utilisation these were characterised as ‘high utilisation and frequent home visits’ (n= 393), ‘low utilisation, GP only’ (n= 3231) and ‘high utilisation, GP and nurse’ (n= 3097). Profiles differed with respect to the patients’ age and type of medication; the oldest patients using insulin were dominant in the ‘high utilisation, GP and nurse’ profile.

40|$|Summary A new {{criterion}} for spectral power distribution (SPD) optimisation is proposed; this is evaluated numerically with a spectral <b>utilisation</b> <b>factor</b> (SUF). SUF is calculable {{on the basis}} of relative SPD and takes into account the luminous efficiency of (visible) radiation as well as the colour discrimination ability of the light source. The theoretical optimal light source is obtainable as a trichromatic line SPD of wavelengths 440 - 530 - 615 nm. The spectral areas of trichromatic SPD lines to optimise both SUF and colour rendering index (CRI) parameters have also been determined as 440 - 450 nm for blue, 530 - 540 nm for green and 610 nm for red lines at a spectral line (band) width of about 20 - 30 nm. Depending on correlated colour temperature and achromaticity requirements, various radiant intensity ratios of line (band) SPDS should be investigated for both the above criteria. The conclusions of the paper can be applied to improve the performance of practical light sources. ...|$|R
