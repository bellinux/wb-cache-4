5|$|Henry Fownes Luttrell, {{who married}} Margaret, Alexander's daughter, {{and took the}} Luttrell name, moved to Dunster in 1747. The couple {{redesigned}} and redecorated the castle in a Rococo style, including the extensive use of the recently invented and highly fashionable wallpaper. Henry Luttrell raised the ground height of the Lower Ward between 1764 and 1765 to extend <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Way</b> all {{around to the front}} of his mansion, adding additional ornamental towers onto the inside of the Great Gatehouse in the process. A folly, Conygar Tower, was constructed by architect Richard Phelps to improve the view from the castle, and a larger park of 141 hectares (348acres) was built just to the south of the castle, requiring the eviction of a number of tenant farmers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 18th century the Luttrells and Dunster Castle faced many {{financial}} challenges. Francis's son Alexander, inherited the castle when he came of age in 1704, but it was still mostly empty and carried large debts with it. Alexander died young in 1711 and his widow, Dorothy, spent almost twenty years paying off the debts. Dorothy built a new chapel, designed by Sir James Thornhill in white Portland stone, on the rear of the mansion at a cost of £1,300 (£178,000 at 2009 prices); few records of this remain, but the interior probably resembled that of the chapel at Wimpole Hall. A safer, if less grand, approach road to the castle was created, called <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Way,</b> and the remains of the Upper Ward on top of the motte were flattened {{to be used as a}} bowling green, complete with an octagonal summer house. Dorothy's son, Alexander Luttrell, took over the castle in 1726 but ran up new debts, and the castle was handed over into the control of a receiver.|$|E

5|$|When Gilberto {{moved to}} England and began {{training}} with Arsenal, {{he bought a}} house in St Albans, South Hertfordshire. Having been used to life in small Brazilian towns, he initially struggled to adapt to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>way</b> of life in London. However, on the pitch, he settled in very quickly. On 11 August 2002 he made his Arsenal debut as a substitute against Liverpool {{in the second half of}} the FA Community Shield game in which he scored the winning goal. As the 2002–03 FA Premier League season began, Gilberto faced stiff competition for a place in midfield from compatriot Edu. After two substitute appearances, Gilberto finally broke into the starting eleven on 27 August, helping Arsenal to a 5–2 win against West Bromwich Albion. Gilberto's good form continued as he set a new record for the fastest goal scored in the UEFA Champions League, scoring after 20.07 seconds against PSV on 25 September 2002. However, his legal problems continued, since his transfer to England still was not fully resolved. As a result, Gilberto instructed his lawyers to start legal proceedings against Atlético Mineiro for unpaid wages in November 2002. For the second half of the 2002–03 season, he remained a regular starter in the Arsenal side. Even though he suffered a lapse in form towards the end of the season, he won an FA Cup winner's medal, playing in the final at the Millennium Stadium as Arsenal beat Southampton 1–0.|$|E

After Kasparaitis refused to fight Brashear at various points in the game, Brashear hit Kasparaitis with a gloved punch with 1:53 remaining in the game. Kasparaitis did not fight back, and instead covered up to protect himself. Brashear was assessed 29 PIMs for the incident, including an instigator penalty. Brashear was given a one-game suspension due to new League rules for the 2005–06 season; any player given an instigator penalty in the final five minutes of regulation or overtime would receive an automatic one-game suspension. At the end of the year, he was again in the top ten (eighth) in PIMs, accumulating 166, but his offensive production dropped to a mere nine points. The Flyers opted not to re-sign the enforcer.|$|E

500|$|Eloy Mestrelle {{introduced}} milled coinage to England in 1561, {{but their}} production ceased in 1575. On 8 August 1649, the Council of State and the House of Commons opted to summon Peter Blondeau, a Paris Mint engineer, to London to modernise {{operations at the}} Tower Mint. Mint officials opposed Blondeau's techniques, and subjected him {{to a series of}} trials in which the quality of his product would be compared to that made by the Mint. According to a pamphlet published in Blondeau's name, his process is described as [...] "a new invention, to make a handsome coyne... that shall not only be stamped flat on both sides, but shall even be marked with letters on the thickness of the brim," [...] which was intended to prevent clipping. Blondeau described, in a proposition presumably meant for the Committee of the Mint, [...] "two different ways to make the pieces marked about the thicknesse or edge. One is auncient, knowne to severall men, and according whereunto David Ramage , workeman of the Mint, hath made some bigg pieces; but that way is very tedious, requireth much time, spoyles abondance of stamps and engines, and cannot be done upon the currant money, which is thynne." [...] Blondeau was referring to the type of collar added to the Paris Mint's early coinage presses by Olivier, which were time-consuming to use and caused significant damage to coinage dies and engines. He went on to say [...] "s touching <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>way,</b> which is ready and expeditious, and can be based upon the thynne and currant money, I am the inventor of it, and only I know itt, as I can make appeare by experiences, if it be the pleasure of the State to imploy me." [...] Blondeau also argued that his methods would prevent counterfeiting, because the machinery required was too complex to be duplicated by criminals.|$|E
