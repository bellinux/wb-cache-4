40|$|Mucts 4 was {{isolated}} more than 30 {{years ago and}} was the first available thermoinducible derivative of transposable phage Mu. We have characterized <b>the</b> <b>cts</b> 4 mutation and the corresponding mutant protein. Contrary to previously characterized thermoinducible Mu prophages (e. g. Mucts 62), Mucts 4 lysogenizes at reduced frequency even at 30 °C. <b>The</b> <b>cts</b> 4 mutation (Leu 129 Val) was located in this central repressor region. <b>The</b> <b>cts</b> 4 protein was thermosensitive for operator DNA binding in vitro. Temperature-dependent changes in protein-protein cross-linking patterns in the absence of DNA were detected for purified wild type, cts 62 and cts 4 repressor proteins. <b>The</b> <b>cts</b> 4 protein exhibited a subtly different electrophoretic profile, which became more marked at higher temperatures, from both the wild type and cts 62. In addition <b>the</b> <b>cts</b> 4 repressor generated a significantly different pattern of binding to DNA fragments carrying the early operator region. Consistent with the predicted involvement of the central leucine-rich region of the Mu repressor in the formation of multimeric forms, <b>the</b> <b>cts</b> 4 mutation thus appeared to affect protein-protein interactions. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

King lies to Wilder, telling {{him that she was}} injured in a mugging. Wilder calls the police; King attempts to contact her boyfriend, Dr. Cooper Freedman (Paul Adelstein), but cannot reach him because he is out drinking with Dr. Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone) and Dr. Sam Bennett (Taye Diggs). At the police station psychiatrist Sheldon Wallace (Brian Benben) interrogates Lee McHenry (Nicholas Brendon), who was found with blood on his clothes. After nurses photograph King's injuries, Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) realizes that King was raped and offers her a rape kit. During her pelvic examination, King refuses the rape kit and tells Montgomery not to tell anyone else about the rape. Freedman arrives with Shepherd and Bennett, and is surprised at the extent of King's injuries. During <b>the</b> <b>CT</b> scan, King and Shepherd bond over their shared drug addiction when King refuses pain medication. Shepherd admits drinking alcohol again, and King offers to take her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Shepherd sutures King's wounds, which causes King great pain; Freedman feels powerless, unable to protect her.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{evaluates the}} {{correlation}} between preoperative symptoms, quality-of-life questionnaires (chronic sinusitis survey and 20 -Item Sinonasal Outcome Test [SNOT- 20]), and staging on computer tomography (CT). It consisted of a prospective cohort study of all consecutive patients undergoing surgery for medically nonresponsive chronic sinusitis, which took place at a tertiary care center. METHODS: Two hundred twenty-one patients completed the Chronic Sinusitis Survey (CSS) questionnaire and the SNOT- 20. A visual analog scale (VAS) symptom score was completed also. The {{average age of the}} patients was 44. 5 years and the male/female ratio was 1. 3 : 1. The symptom scores of all three questionnaires were compared with <b>the</b> Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> scan score of the sinuses. RESULTS: <b>The</b> median Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> score was 12 (mean +/- SD, 12. 7 +/- 5. 7). There was no significant correlation between the SNOT- 20 questionnaire and <b>the</b> Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> score (p = 0. 026; p = 0. 764) and between the CSS and <b>the</b> Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> score (p = - 0. 158; p = 0. 058). Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between a single VAS symptom score relating to overall sinonasal symptom severity and <b>the</b> Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> scan score (p = 0. 135; p = 0. 121). However, a weak but statistically significant correlation was found between the VAS score based on the sum of five sinonasal symptoms and <b>the</b> Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> scan score (p = 0. 197; p = 0. 020). CONCLUSION: The score, based on the sum of five sinonasal VAS symptoms, correlates to the disease severity as measured by <b>the</b> Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> scan score. <b>The</b> SNOT- 20 questionnaire and the CSS symptom score do not correlate to <b>the</b> Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> scan score, although a correlation was found between the CSS score and <b>the</b> Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> score in various sub-groups of our patient population...|$|R

40|$|Background. With modern CT imaging a {{comprehensive}} overview of cerebral macro- and microcirculation {{can be obtained}} within minutes in acute ischemic stroke. This opens for patient stratification and individualized treatment. Methods.

The patients were clinically evaluated according to the NIHSS-scale, examined with <b>the</b> comprehensive <b>CT</b> protocol including both CT angiography and CT perfusion, and followed up by MRI. Results. <b>The</b> comprehensive <b>CT</b> examination protocol increased the examination time but did not delay treatment initiation. In some cases <b>CT</b> angiography revealed <b>the</b> cause of stroke while CT perfusion located and graded the perfusion defect with reasonable accuracy, confirmed by follow-up MR-diffusion.

The study aims to determine the percentage of extraosseous findings from <b>the</b> unenhanced <b>CT</b> portion of 18 F-fluoride PET/CT scans. Materials and Methods. We retrospectively collected 18 F-fluoride PET/CT studies between March 2010 and February 2011. <b>The</b> unenhanced <b>CT</b> portions of 18 F-fluoride PET/CT were reviewed for each patient. Significant extraosseous findings related to malignancy from <b>the</b> unenhanced <b>CT</b> were recorded. Results. A total of 158 patients (110 females, 48 males) {{were included in the}} study. Clinically significant extraosseous findings from <b>the</b> unenhanced <b>CT</b> were found in 43 patients (27. 2 %). Previously unknown extraosseous findings were identified in 17 patients (10. 8 %) after a review of the 18 F-fluoride PET/CT scan results.

It is not rare to identify new clinically significant extraosseous findings from <b>the</b> unenhanced <b>CT</b> of 18 F-fluoride PET/CT studies. Therefore the clinical management of patients may be altered by the results, and a careful review of <b>the</b> unenhanced <b>CT</b> portion of 18 F-fluoride PET/CT is mandatory...|$|R
40|$|Hepatic fungal {{infection}} {{is a frequent}} complication in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy for acute leukaemia.

We therefore retrospectively analysed the number and the volume of hepatic fungal lesions in 24 CT of 20 consecutive patients treated for acute leukaemia during late-arterial and porto-venous phase. The mean number of lesions per patient was 31 (range: 3 - 105) in the late-arterial and 26 (3 - 81) in <b>the</b> porto-venous <b>CT</b> (P =  0. 026). The mean total volume of all lesions was 6. 45  ml in the late-arterial and 4. 07  ml in <b>the</b> porto-venous <b>CT</b> representing a 1. 6 fold difference between <b>the</b> two <b>CT</b> scans (P =  0. 008). The total volume of the lesions negatively correlated to the absolute contrast difference between liver parenchyma and liver vein (Pearson correlation, r = - 0. 62; P =  0. 002). In conclusion, <b>the</b> late-arterial <b>CT</b> provides a superior distinction of hepatic lesions due to a delayed perfusion of the outer rim of the fungal lesions resulting in an extended visibility. <b>The</b> late-arterial <b>CT</b> is superior to <b>the</b> porto-venous <b>CT</b> for initial diagnosis and follow-up of hepatic fungal infection...|$|R
