5000|$|Relationships {{with civil}} populations are {{influenced}} by whether the guerrillas operate among a hostile or friendly population. A friendly population is of immense importance to guerrillas, providing shelter, supplies, financing, intelligence and recruits. The [...] "base of the people" [...] is thus the key lifeline of the guerrilla movement. In {{the early stages of}} the Vietnam War, American officials [...] "discovered that several thousand supposedly government-controlled 'fortified hamlets' were in fact controlled by Viet Cong guerrillas, who 'often used them for supply and rest havens'." [...] Popular mass support in a confined local area or country however is not always strictly necessary. Guerrilla and revolutionary groups can still operate using the protection of a friendly regime, drawing supplies, weapons, intelligence, local security and diplomatic cover.

40|$|This {{document}} {{is a report}} of the Light Duty Utility Arm (LDUA) drawing walkdown. The purpose of this walkdown was to validate the essential configuration of the LDUA in preparation of deploying the equipment in a Hanford waste tank. The LDUA system has, over the course of its development, caused the generation of a considerable number of design drawings. The number of drawings is estimated to be well over 1, 000. A large number consist of vendor type drawings, furnished by both Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and SPAR Aerospace Limited (SPAR). A smaller number, approximately 200, are H- 6 <b>type</b> <b>drawing</b> sheets in the Project Hanford Management Contract (PHMC) document control system. A preliminary inspection of the drawings showed that the physical configuration of the LDUA did not match the documented configuration. As a result of these findings, a scoping walkdown of 20 critical drawing sheets was performed to determine if a problem existed in configuration management of the LDUA system. The results of this activity showed that 18 of the 20 drawing sheets were found to contain errors or omissions of varying concern. Given this, Characterization Engineering determined that a walkdown of the drawings necessary and sufficient to enable safe operation and maintenance of the LDUA should be performed. A review team was assembled to perform a review of all of the drawings and determine the set which would need to be verified through an engineering walkdown. The team determined that approximately 150 H- 6 <b>type</b> <b>drawing</b> sheets would need to be verified, 12 SPAR/PNNL drawing sheets would need to be verified and converted to H- 6 drawings, and three to six new drawings would be created (see Appendix A).

40|$|Leverage {{has been}} called “negotiation’s prime mover,” conferring power to reach {{agreement}} “on your terms. ” This power, however, is not always benign. When a negotiator has sufficient power to compel a counterparty to accept a set of unfavorable terms, the use of leverage may cross a line into inappropriate or illegal coercion. While coercion {{has been the subject}} of rich philosophical investigation, the topic of coercive power has received only cursory treatment in the negotiation literature.

The authors suggest that practitioners have something unique and different to offer {{qualitative research}}.

40|$|An {{international}} study {{under the}} United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) {{was performed to}} assess radiological impact of the nuclear accident at the Fukushima-Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (FDNPS) on the marine environment. This work constitutes the first international assessment of this <b>type,</b> <b>drawing</b> upon methodologies that incorporate the most up-to-date radioecological models and knowledge. To quantify the radiological impact on marine wildlife, a suite of state-of-the-art approaches to assess exposures to Fukushima derived radionuclides of marine biota, including predictive dynamic transfer modelling, was applied to a comprehensive dataset consisting of over 500 sediment, 6000 seawater and 5000 biota data points representative of the geographically relevant area {{during the first year}} after the accident. The dataset covers the period from May 2011 to August 2012. The method used to evaluate the ecological impact consists of comparing dose (rates) to which living species of interest are exposed during a defined period to critical effects values arising from the literature. The assessed doses follow a highly variable pattern and generally do not seem to indicate the potential for effects. A possible exception of a transient nature is the relatively contaminated area {{in the vicinity of the}} discharge point, where effects on sensitive endpoints in individual plants and animals might have occurred in the weeks directly following the accident. However, impacts on population integrity would have been unlikely due to the short duration and the limited space area of the initially high exposures. Our understanding of the biological impact of radiation on chronically exposed plants and animals continues to evolve, and still needs to be improved through future studies in the FDNPS marine environment...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} theory and application of Gesture Form Analysis, which systematises necessary processes of spatial conceptualisation for understanding a specific gesture type (pointing, drawing, representing etc.). Eight gesture form operations are proposed, which are combined in a modular fashion. They are applied {{in the analysis of}} gestures of the dissertation corpus and of other literature. The gesture type Pointing At Location is composed of the operations Articulator Profiling (e. g., straight extended arm, hand and index), Shape Profiling (the predominant axis, a line, is profiled), Continuation (the line is continued, indicating a direction), and Intersection (the line intersects with the surface of an object in a point: the location pointed at). The gesture <b>type</b> <b>Drawing</b> ‒ while otherwise containing the same operations as Pointing At Location ‒ requires adding the operation of Trace Leaving (by moving the arm ‒ and hence all the other forms created by the above operations ‒ the point leaves a trace in form of a line). The geometrical operations of Gesture Form Analysis (and the constituent forms specified in parentheses) consider specifically the spatial modality of gesture, taking a first step towards a strictly form-based gesture semantics. The systematic analysis of operations across gesture types results in a gesture typology, in which the dimensions of all constituent forms are defined; thus being open to computational application. The fundamental theoretical distinction of gesture form being non-equivalent to the mere physical form of the articulators (articulator form) is supported by an object-description study in an optical motion-capture system. The methods include operationalising three-dimensional gesture data, for example by a plugin for the video-annotation software Elan...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{relying on}} relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) methodology {{has been designed}} and developed for continuous-field measurements of vertical Hg 0 fluxes over cropland ecosystems. This micro-meteorological technique requires sampling of turbulent eddies into up- and downdraught channels at a constant flow rate and accurate timing, based on a threshold involving the sign of vertical wind component (w). The fully automated system is of a whole-air <b>type</b> <b>drawing</b> air at a high velocity to the REA sampling apparatus and allowing for the rejection of samples associated with w-fluctuations around zero. Conditional sampling was executed at 10 -Hz resolution on a sub-stream by two fast-response three-way solenoid switching valves connected in parallel to a zero Hg 0 air supply through their normally open ports. To suppress flow transients resulting from switching, pressure differentials across the two upstream ports of the conditional valves were minimised using a control unit. The Hg 0 concentrations of the up- and downdraught channel were sequentially (each by two consecutive 5 -minute gas samples) determined after enhancement collection onto gold traps by an automated cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectrophotometer (CVAFS) instrument. A protocol of regular reference sampling periods was implemented during field campaigns to continuously adjust for bias that may exist between the two conditional sampling channels. Using a 5 -minute running average was conditional threshold, nearly-constant relaxation coefficients (&#x 03 B 2; s) of ~ 0. 56 were determined during two bi-weekly field deployments when turbulence statistics were assured for good quality, in accordance with previously reported estimates. The fully developed REA-CVAFS system underwent Hg 0 flux field trial runs at a winter wheat cropland located in the North China Plain.
