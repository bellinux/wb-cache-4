5|$|The {{development}} of process theology has challenged the Irenaean tradition by teaching that God's power is limited {{and that he}} cannot be responsible for evil. Twentieth century philosopher Alvin Plantinga supported {{the idea that this}} world is the best possible world, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> in the world (including God's infinite goodness) outweighs the evil and proposing that the ultimate good of God's sacrifice when Jesus was crucified necessitated the existence of evil. His free will defence was not a theodicy because he was trying to show the logical compatibility of evil and the existence of God, rather than the probability of God. D. Z. Phillips and Fyodor Dostoyevsky challenged the instrumental use of suffering, suggesting that love cannot be expressed through suffering. However, Dostoyevsky also states that the beauty of love is evident, in that love can continue to grow, withstand and overcome even the most evil acts. Michael Tooley argued that the magnitude of suffering is excessive and that, in some cases, cannot lead to moral development. French theologian Henri Blocher criticised Hick's universalism, arguing that such a view negates free will, which was similarly important to the theodicy.|$|E

2500|$|Months later, a {{customs officer}} {{discovered}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> {{had not been}} entered into the vessel's manifest. The Director-General of Customs and Excise ("DG") then made inquiries with the agent of the vessel, {{referred to in the}} judgment as [...] "TTS", who denied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> had been loaded. The DG subsequently asked the company to furnish evidence of the export of <b>the</b> <b>goods.</b> On 19 September 1988, the company produced a document signed by a businessman, [...] "TKM", stating that he had purchased and received <b>the</b> <b>goods.</b> After further correspondence, <b>the</b> DG concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> had not been exported and requested the company to pay S$130,241.30 in customs duty pursuant to regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979.|$|R

25|$|It {{unfortunately}} {{appears to}} us, and many residents of Bay County, that Dr. Siebert {{has become a}} scapegoat for those seeking a political solution to recent events, rather than a logical resolution based upon science and fact. The bottom line is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> people of Bay County, including those serving on the local search committee, are apparently being ignored in their plea to keep Dr. Siebert as Medical Examiner.|$|E
25|$|The mythical {{stories told}} for Diwali vary {{regionally}} {{and within the}} traditions of Hinduism. Yet, they all point to joy and the celebration of Diwali with lights to be {{a reminder of the}} importance of knowledge, self inquiry, self-improvement, knowing and seeking the good and the right path. It is a metaphor for resisting evil, for dispelling darkness and for compassion to others. Diwali is the celebration of this inner light over spiritual darkness, of knowledge over ignorance and right over wrong. It is a festive restatement of the Hindu belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> ultimately triumphs over evil.|$|E
25|$|In X-Men: Days of Future Past, the time-displaced Wolverine {{encourages}} the young Charles Xavier to later recruit Jean Grey {{for the future}} team, along with Ororo Munroe and Scott Summers, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> they accomplished outweighs the bad they experienced. Commentary in the film confirms that the young red-haired girl's identity in the field who was marveling at Magneto levitating the Robert F. Kennedy stadium was in fact Jean Grey as a young child. When the timeline resets, Logan is astonished to discover that Jean and Cyclops are {{alive and well in}} the new timeline, suggesting that the events of the original X-Men films played out very differently.|$|E

50|$|The Infants’ Relief Act, 1874 and <b>the</b> Sale of <b>Goods</b> Act, 1893 {{set up a}} {{situation}} where minors' contracts are absolutely void, except those for necessaries. To recover money from a minor's contract for necessaries, {{it is not enough}} to show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> were suitable to the infant's condition in life, one must also show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> minor was not sufficiently supplied at the time. As no evidence has been introduced to suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> were necessaries, <b>the</b> trial judge's decision was correct.|$|R
25|$|T’boli tribe thrive near Lake Sebu {{and has an}} {{interesting}} philosophy of death and life. They believed that death occurs if his/her spirit leave the body permanently by the evil spirit, Busao. So their burial custom starts with laying the corpse on the boat-shaped coffin, which will be celebrated from a week to five months (and even a year for respected people like datu). The tribe often throws feast for commemoration in a positive vibe. This body, together with the wooden boat will be burnt {{at the end of}} the long wake, where the liquid extract from burnt woods will be collected for eatery. The tribe believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> qualities of the dead will be passed over through that liquid extract.|$|E
25|$|Several petroglyphic {{labyrinths}} {{have also}} been discovered in South West Britain. The best known of these are a neighbouring pair {{that have been found}} engraved onto a shale outcrop at Rocky Valley, Cornwall. Apparently incised using a metal implement, Nash suggested that the southern labyrinth had previously been engraved using a stone tool. Publicly revealed in 1948, {{it has been suggested that}} they are Bronze Age in date, due to similarities with Bronze Age petroglyphs in Galicia and Valcamonica. Conversely, many rock art researchers do not consider them to be prehistoric, with Saward arguing that they were created between the 16th and 18th-centuries, when the neighbouring Trewethett Mill was operational. As evidence, she noted that labyrinths were a popular motif in folk customs at the time, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> state of preservation would not be present if they had prehistoric origins.|$|E
25|$|When General von Falkenhorst {{delivered}} the initial {{plans for the}} invasions of Norway and Denmark to Hitler, on 29 February 1940, Egersund had been selected {{as one of the}} Norwegian targets for the first day. Egersund was considered important to secure because of the town having the Norwegian land station for an undersea telegraph cable from Norway to Peterhead, Scotland. By severing Norway's links with the outside world, the Germans intended to inhibit Allied intelligence from gaining information on the German invasion. It would also aid the Germans in gaining control of Norway's communications, and in using those communications to pacify the population and discourage resistance. Capturing Egersund would also allow the German invasion forces to cut the important road and railway links that led through the town. Further, the German planners feared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> harbour at Egersund, if left unoccupied, could be used by Norwegian or Allied troops to attack Stavanger Airport, Sola, an airport which featured prominently in the German invasion plans.|$|E

The seller can defeat this claim if (a) [...] "it is established <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> did so conform" [...] at the time of delivery, or (b) the measure is [...] "incompatible with the nature of <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> or <b>the</b> nature of the lack of conformity.|$|R

25|$|The {{starting}} point of the scholarly controversy is the disputed meaning of the Greek concept of ousia. This is an ordinary Greek word and literally means 'being.' In philosophical contexts, it is usually translated by 'Being' or 'Essence.' Plato's Republic says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> is 'not ousia' but is rather 'beyond ousia' and surpasses it as an origin and in power. If this passage implies only that the essence or nature of the Good is beyond Being (but not the Good itself), or if the passage is just interpreted loosely, then the Form of the Good can retain its place inside {{the realm of the}} Forms, i.e., the realm of things with real Being. In this case the Good is not absolutely transcendent: it does not transcend Being and somehow exist above it. The Good would therefore have a place in the hierarchy of real Beings. According to this interpretation, the Good is not an issue for the two principles of the unwritten doctrines but only for the Theory of Forms. On the other hand, if the passage in the Republic is read literally and 'ousia' means 'Being,' then the phrase 'beyond Being' implies the Good actually transcends Being. According to this interpretation, Plato considered the Good to be absolutely transcendent and it must be integrated into the realm of the two principles.|$|E
500|$|Several {{concepts}} and items of imagery {{have been used}} in Biblical comparisons. Jor-El casts out General Zod from Krypton, a parallel to the casting out of Satan from Heaven. The spacecraft that brings Kal-El to Earth {{is in the form of}} a star (Star of Bethlehem). Kal-El comes to Jonathan and Martha Kent, who are unable to have children. Martha Kent states, [...] "All these years how we've prayed and prayed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> Lord would see fit to give us a child," [...] which was compared to the Virgin Mary.|$|E
500|$|Several {{critics have}} focused on the theme of motherhood. In [...] "Mothers and Daughters/Aging and Dying", Claire Sprague wrote that Lessing often dwells on the theme of mothers passing their {{behaviours}} onto their daughters, and how the cycle of daughters fighting their mothers permeates each generation. The British novelist Jane Rogers said <b>that</b> <b>The</b> <b>Good</b> Terrorist [...] "is as unsparing and incisive about motherhood as it is about the extreme left", and that motherhood here [...] "is terrible": Alice's mother is reduced to despair continually yielding to her selfish daughter's demands; Alice mothers Jasper, and has a similar despairing relationship with him. Rogers added that motherhood is depicted here as a compulsion to protect the weak, despite their propensity to retaliate and hurt you.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "carrier" [...] {{was hired}} by a Flemish {{merchant}} to transport bales of woad (a type of dye) to the port in Southampton. He opened the bales and took <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> for himself. Some of it came into possession of the Sheriff of London. The sheriff {{gave it to the}} King (forfeited as [...] "waif", a word to signify runaways or stolen <b>goods).</b> <b>The</b> merchant sued the sheriff to return <b>the</b> <b>goods.</b> He argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> were not stolen, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> carrier only had temporary property rights and so <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> could not be given to the King. <b>The</b> Sheriff argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> were stolen, <b>that</b> it was a felony and therefore properly forfeited to the King as waif.|$|R

500|$|In the off-season, the Islanders {{selected}} goaltender Rick DiPietro {{with the}} first overall pick in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. DiPietro's selection supplanted Luongo as the highest-drafted goaltender in NHL history and the Islanders' goaltender of the future. Consequently, Milbury traded Luongo to the Florida Panthers along with centre Olli Jokinen for winger Mark Parrish and centre Oleg Kvasha that same day on June 24, 2000. The deal would later be seen to have disproportionately benefited the Panthers, as both Jokinen and Luongo would eventually develop into star players, in contrast to Parrish and Kvasha. Luongo expressed surprise at the trade, saying, [...] "I didn't expect it at all. One day they're telling me I'm the goalie of the future, {{and the next day}} I'm gone. I didn't really appreciate <b>that.</b> <b>The</b> <b>good</b> side is that [...] wanted me." ...|$|E
500|$|Gordon {{was chosen}} as the showrunner for the series by Killen. Gordon commended the pilot script at first glance. Gordon {{originally}} read the script on a flight to New York City. [...] "I read the pilot, and once I got past my envy, I was struck by the voice," [...] he stated. [...] "So few writers have real voices. Kyle is disarmingly self-effacing; and at the same time, he's disarmingly confident. It's that duality thing: On the one hand, he's open; on the other, he's closed." [...] Gordon later compared the television series to The Good Wife. He said <b>that</b> <b>The</b> <b>Good</b> Wife has so many procedural aspects that you have to decide which format to use each week. He compared it to Awake, saying, then, [...] "What makes an Awake episode?" [...] "Pilot" [...] was written by Killen, and directed by David Slade.|$|E
500|$|Just {{as the war}} was in {{the balance}} on the Western Front, so the fate of Luxembourg was see-sawing back and forth. [...] It was clear to all <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> conduct of the Luxembourgish government, if fully {{receptive}} {{to the needs of}} the German military administrators, could guarantee Luxembourg's continued self-government, at least in the short-term. [...] Eyschen was a familiar and overwhelmingly popular leader, and all factions put their utmost faith in his ability to steer Luxembourg through the diplomatic minefield that was occupation. [...] On 4 August 1914, he expelled the French minister in Luxembourg at the request of the German minister, followed by the Belgian minister four days later and the Italian minister when his country entered the war. [...] To the same end, Eyschen refused to speak ill of the German Zollverein, even though he had talked openly of exiting the customs union before the war began.|$|E

[...] He informs Billy that fifteen years have passed on Earth since the former barker's suicide, and {{suggests}} that Billy can get himself into heaven if he helps his daughter, Louise. [...] He helps Billy look down from heaven to see her (instrumental ballet: [...] "Billy Makes a Journey"). Louise has grown up to be lonely and bitter. [...] The local children ostracize her because her father was a thief and a wife-beater. [...] In the dance, a young ruffian, much like her father at that age, flirts with her and abandons her as too young.

500|$|Skipper W was a 1945 sorrel {{stallion}} bred by H. J. Wiescamp of Alamosa, Colorado. Sired by Nick Shoemaker, {{whose father}} was Nick sired by Shiek P-11, Skipper W was out of Hired Girl, a daughter of Cowboy P-12. His second dam, or maternal grandmother, was Leche, who was also fathered by Nick by Shiek P-11. The colt was named Skipper W because, as Wiescamp related:I had another good stud colt born {{around the same time}} as Skipper. He was a palomino sired by Gold Mount and out of Slipalong Wiescamp. That was also the year <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> movie, Showboat, came out and I named the little yellow colt after that picture. Anyway, I had Hired Girl up in a corral and, after she foaled, I told a fellow who was working for me to disinfect the naval on the colt [...] After the man did that, the colt got up and turned around and kicked him 'cause it smarted. I said to that fellow, [...] "Look at that, he already knows he's the boss! I've got a showboat, and every boat needs a skipper, so that's what I'm going to name him– Skipper." [...] I added the W for Wiescamp.|$|E
500|$|Carnivàles central premise was {{considered}} [...] "cloudy", [...] "unconventional", {{and filled with}} [...] "convoluted symbolic interpretations of historical events" [...] after Daniel Knauf had told TV critics that he regarded the 1930s as [...] "the last great age of magic" [...] being ended by an atomic bomb to herald the Age of Reason. Many reviews quoted and commented on Samson's prologue to explain both the apocalyptic premise and the mythology of the show. Some reviews asserted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> and evil creatures described in the prologue were Ben and Justin, preparing for a final battle. Still, many reviews were reluctant to state who of the main characters was good and who was evil, aware that it might take some time until this question was answered for sure. Ben and his healing powers led most reviewers {{to believe that he}} was the good creature, and that Justin was a demon or at least a dangerous zealot who received instructions from either God or Satan. Some reviews described the question of Ben's parentage as one of the big puzzles and the show's driving mystery, but refrained from defining further details of the series. The lack of revelation of the characters' roles was apparent {{by the end of the}} first season, although critics expected Sofie to gain significance later in the story.|$|E
