5|$|Smith {{replied that}} in his {{interpretation}} Rhodesia was required to keep Whitehall informed, but prior British concurrence was not necessary; if Britain contested this, the Prime Minister said, then surely the 1957 entrustment had never meant anything. Dupont then spoke again, rejecting {{the idea that the}} Rhodesian mission should be a mere subsidiary consulate of the British Embassy. Hughes replied firmly that the 1957 despatch did not give the Rhodesians free rein over external matters, and warned them to be more flexible if they intended <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>common</b> ground. Eager to avoid open confrontation, Smith told Dupont to reconsider his tone, and changed the subject.|$|E
5|$|As the Democratic Convention of 1860 approached, some asked Pierce {{to run as}} a {{compromise}} candidate that could unite the fractured party, but Pierce refused. As Douglas struggled to attract southern support, Pierce backed Cushing and then Breckinridge as potential alternatives, but his priority was a united Democratic Party. The split Democrats were soundly defeated for the presidency by the Republican candidate, Lincoln. In the months between Lincoln's election, and his inauguration on March 4, 1861, Pierce looked on as several southern states began plans to secede. He was asked by Justice Campbell to travel to Alabama and address that state's secession convention. Due to illness he declined, but sent a letter appealing {{to the people of}} Alabama to remain in the Union, and give the North time to repeal laws against southern interests and <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>common</b> ground.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, he {{was picked}} by New York Governor Mario Cuomo to chair a {{scientific}} fact-finding commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, a job that required him <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>common</b> ground between the many viewpoints represented on the commission. The commission eventually recommended {{the closure of the}} plant, a course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the adequacy of emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E

25|$|Critics object {{claiming}} that the ASEAN Way's emphasis on consultation, consensus, and non-interference, forces the organisation to adopt only those policies which satisfy the lowest common denominator.

Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos emphasise non-interference while older member countries focus on co-operation and co-ordination.

30|$|The convex {{feasibility}} problem (CFP) {{considered in}} [6] {{is a central}} problem in applied mathematics, which can be formulated in various ways <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a <b>common</b> point of closed and convex sets, <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a <b>common</b> fixed-point of nonexpansive mappings, <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a <b>common</b> minimum of convex functionals, to solve a system of variational inequalities. The (CFP) is <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{a member of the}} intersection of finitely many closed convex sets in Euclidean spaces. When the intersection is empty, one can minimize a proximity function to obtain an approximate solution to the problem. The split feasibility problem (SFP) and the split equality problem (SEP) are generalizations of the (CFP). The (SFP) arises in many areas of applications such as phase retrieval, medical image reconstruction, computer temography and radiation therapy treatment planning; see, e.g., [7 – 11]. In 1994, Censor and Elfving [10] introduced the following (SFP) in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces.|$|R

He was typically friendly and welcoming, and appeared relaxed in conversation with everyone, including his opponents. A self-described Anglophile, {{he claimed to have}} lived by the [...] "trappings of British style and manners".

500|$|Academic Peter Hutchings, {{noting the}} many {{definitions}} of a cult film that require transgressive elements, states that cult films are known {{in part for}} their excesses. [...] Both subject matter and its depiction are portrayed in extreme ways that break taboos of good taste and aesthetic norms. [...] Violence, gore, sexual perversity, and even the music can be pushed to stylistic excess far beyond that allowed by mainstream cinema. Film censorship can make these films obscure and difficult <b>to</b> <b>find,</b> <b>common</b> criteria used to define cult films. [...] Despite this, these films remain well-known and prized among collectors. [...] Fans will occasionally express frustration with dismissive critics and conventional analysis, which they believe marginalizes and misinterprets paracinema. [...] In marketing these films, young men are predominantly targeted. [...] Horror films in particular can draw fans who seek the most extreme films. [...] Audiences can also ironically latch on to offensive themes, such as misogyny, using these films as catharsis {{for the things that}} they hate most in life. [...] Exploitative, transgressive elements can be pushed to excessive extremes for both humor and satire. Frank Henenlotter faced censorship and ridicule, but he found acceptance among audiences receptive to themes that Hollywood was reluctant to touch, such as violence, drug addiction, and misogyny. Lloyd Kaufman sees his films' political statements as more populist and authentic than the hypocrisy of mainstream films and celebrities. Despite featuring an abundance of fake blood, vomit, and diarrhea, Kaufman's films have attracted positive attention from critics and academics. [...] Excess can also exist as camp, such as films that highlight the excesses of 1980s fashion and commercialism.|$|E
