25|$|Modern organ {{transplantation}} in Iran dates to 1935, {{when the first}} cornea transplant in Iran was performed by Professor Mohammad-Qoli Shams at Farabi Hospital in Tehran, Iran. The Shiraz Nemazi transplant center, {{also one of the}} pioneering transplant units of Iran, performed the first Iranian kidney transplant in 1967 and the first Iranian liver transplant in 1995. The first heart transplant in Iran was performed 1993 in Tabriz. The first lung transplant was performed in 2001, and the first heart and lung transplants were performed in 2002, both at Tehran University. Iran developed the first artificial lung in 2009 to join five other countries in the world that possess such technology. Currently, renal, liver, and heart transplantations are routinely performed in Iran. Iran ranks fifth in the world in kidney transplants. The Iranian <b>Tissue</b> <b>Bank,</b> commencing in 1994, was the first multi-facility <b>tissue</b> <b>bank</b> in country. In June 2000, the Organ Transplantation Brain Death Act was approved by the Parliament, followed by the establishment of the Iranian Network for Transplantation Organ Procurement. This act helped to expand heart, lung, and liver transplantation programs. By 2003, Iran had performed 131 liver, 77 heart, 7 lung, 211 bone marrow, 20,581 cornea, and 16,859 renal transplantations. 82percent of these were donated by living and unrelated donors; 10percent by cadavers; and 8percent came from living-related donors. The 3-year renal transplant patient survival rate was 92.9%, and the 40-month graft survival rate was 85.9%.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: According to the EU Directive 2006 / 17 /EC, European <b>tissue</b> <b>banks</b> are {{required}} to perform a physical examination on every potential tissue donor. The directive itself, however, does not specify the content of this examination. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the current practice of physical examination in European <b>tissue</b> <b>banks.</b> A questionnaire was drawn up and sent to the members of the European Association of <b>Tissue</b> <b>Banks</b> and the European Eye Bank Association. Information was gathered on the type of procurement; the personnel involved (number, educational background and training); the content of physical examination; the problems encountered; and the outcome of the performed physical examinations. Completed questionnaires were received from 32 European <b>tissue</b> <b>banks</b> (response rate of 35 %). Of these <b>tissue</b> <b>banks,</b> 73 % perform a physical examination. The most frequently encountered problems are the inability to open the mouth due to rigor mortis, the inability to examine the total body surface and the incapacity to palpate the lymph nodes. <b>Tissue</b> <b>banks</b> reject potential donors, based on the results of the physical examination in 5 % of cases (median rejection rate). Twenty-seven percent of the responding <b>tissue</b> <b>banks</b> do not perform a physical examination. This was most often due to a lack of adequate educational background and/or a lack of appropriate training...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} <b>tissue</b> <b>banking</b> {{is as old}} as the use of skin {{grafting}} for resurfacing of burn wounds. Beneficial effects of tissue grafts led to wide spread use of auto and allograft for management of varied clinical conditions like skin wounds, bone defects following trauma or tumor ablation. Availability of adequate amount of tissues at the time of requirement was the biggest challenge that forced clinicians to find out techniques to preserve the living tissue for prolonged period of time for later use and thus the foundation of <b>tissue</b> <b>banking</b> was started in early twentieth century. Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation of human tissues for clinical use is the major activity of <b>tissue</b> <b>banks.</b> Low temperature storage of processed tissue is the best preservation technique at present. <b>Tissue</b> <b>banking</b> organization is a very complex system and needs high technical expertise and skilled personnel for proper functioning in a dedicated facility.
