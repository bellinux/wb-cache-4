5|$|A {{few months}} after his return to Louisville, Blackburn opened a {{sanatorium}} near Cave Hill Cemetery. His failing health impeded the success of <b>the</b> <b>endeavor,</b> however, and in January 1887, {{he returned to the}} state capital of Frankfort—a city he regarded as his home—knowing that death was near. After a prolonged illness, he became comatose and died September 14, 1887. He was buried in Frankfort Cemetery.|$|E

Arroway gains backing from secretive billionaire industrialist S.R. Hadden, which allows her to continue the project at the Very Large Array in New Mexico.|$|E

5|$|During {{this same}} time, a {{constitutional}} convention {{was called to}} determine California's application for statehood into the United States. After statehood was granted, the capital city moved between three cities in the Bay Area: San Jose (1849–1851), Vallejo (1851–1852), and Benicia (1852–1853) before permanently settling in Sacramento in 1854. As the Gold Rush wound down, wealth generated from <b>the</b> <b>endeavor</b> led {{to the establishment of}} Wells Fargo Bank and the Bank of California, and immigrant laborers attracted by the promise of wealth transformed the demographic makeup of the region. Construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad from the Oakland Long Wharf attracted so many laborers from China that by 1870, eight percent of San Francisco's population was of Asian origin. The completion of the railroad connected the Bay Area {{with the rest of the}} United States, established a truly national marketplace for the trade of goods, and accelerated the urbanization of the region.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{started in}} August 2006 at the Wikimania 2006 conference, and by April 2007 {{the team had}} {{aggregated}} 100 hours of footage. Co-director Hill accompanied Wales during 2007, filming him as he journeyed around the globe. Hill took a two-person film crew and traveled to China, Indonesia, India, South Africa, Australia and Europe, interviewing editors and contributors. Hill is himself an editor of Wikipedia, starting an article about a graffiti artist. Gibson and Hill required expertise in the creative and funding aspects of film-making and invited Scott Glosserman to join the venture. Glosserman's involvement with the film began during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. After Glosserman signed on, the breadth of <b>the</b> <b>endeavor</b> became larger. The film ended up taking an additional three years to finish after Glosserman joined the production.|$|E
5|$|Utilizing his findings, Gray {{developed}} an objective, statistical forecast for seasonal hurricane activity; he predicted only {{the number of}} tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes, foregoing specifics on tracks and potential landfalls due to the aforementioned inconsistencies. Gray issued his first seasonal forecast ahead of the 1984 season, which used the statistical relationships between tropical cyclone activity, the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), and Caribbean basin sea-level pressures. <b>The</b> <b>endeavor</b> proved modestly successful. He subsequently issued forecasts ahead of {{the start of the}} Atlantic hurricane season in May and before the peak of the season in August. Students and colleagues joined his forecast team in the following years, including Christopher Landsea, Paul W. Mielke Jr., and Kenneth J. Berry.|$|E

5|$|Ideas for a Conan film were {{proposed}} {{as early as}} 1970; Pressman and associate producer Edward Summer began {{a concerted effort to}} get the film made in 1975. It took them two years to obtain the film rights, after which they recruited Schwarzenegger for the lead role and Oliver Stone to draft a script. Pressman lacked capital for <b>the</b> <b>endeavor,</b> and in 1979, after having his proposals for investments rejected by the major studios, he sold the project to Dino De Laurentiis. Milius was appointed as director and he rewrote Stone's script. The final screenplay integrated scenes from Howard's stories and from films such as Kwaidan and Seven Samurai. Filming took place in Spain over five months in the regions around Madrid and Almería. The sets, designed by Ron Cobb, were based on Dark Age cultures and Frank Frazetta's paintings of Conan. Milius eschewed optical effects, preferring to realize his ideas with mechanical constructs and optical illusions. Schwarzenegger performed most of his own stunts, and two types of swords, costing $10,000 each, were forged for his character. The editing process took over a year and several violent scenes were cut.|$|E
5|$|Many {{graduates}} of Lahainaluna became politicians or advisors {{in the court}} of King Kamehameha III. Kapena became the secretary and advisor to Kīnaʻu, the Kuhina Nui (an office similar to that of a prime minister or co-regent), and represented her in the drafting of Hawaii's first constitution and declaration of rights. In an effort to establish a stable government against colonial ambitions, King Kamehameha III, the Kuhina Nui and the council of chiefs sought to make Hawaii a constitutional monarchy. Kapena and Boaz Mahune (representing the King) assisted American missionary William Richards in <b>the</b> <b>endeavor</b> of drafting this document. Mahune and the graduates at Lahainaluna were chiefly credited with drafting the Declaration of Rights of 1839 in the contemporary newspaper The Polynesian. However, research by Hawaiian historian Jon Kamakawiwoʻole Osorio credits Richards as the actual author of the Declaration and the majority of the later 1840 Constitution while Mahune and Kapena were only assistants. The 1840 constitution codified the existing political structure of the kingdom and created the Hawaiian Supreme Court and the Legislature of Hawaii.|$|E
