5|$|I {{realized}} the point I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> {{with these two}} programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E
5|$|Ernest was {{the subject}} of more {{allegations}} in 1832, when two young women accused him of trying to ride them down as they walked near Hammersmith. The Duke had not left his grounds at Kew on the day in question, and was able to ascertain that the rider was one of his equerries, who professed not to have seen the women. Nevertheless, newspapers continued to print references to the incident, suggesting that Ernest had done what the women stated, and was cravenly <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> blame on another. The same year, the Duke sued for libel after a book appeared accusing him of having his valet Neale kill Sellis, and the jury found against the author. Also in 1832, the Cumberlands suffered tragedy, as young Prince George went blind. The Prince had been blind in one eye from infancy; an accident at age thirteen took the sight of the other. Ernest had hoped his son might marry Princess Victoria and keep the British and Hanoverian Thrones united, but the handicap made it unlikely George could win Princess Victoria's hand, and raised questions about whether he should succeed in Hanover.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{announcements}} {{concerning the}} three titles, Operation Rainfall {{came into existence}} {{in an effort to}} persuade Nintendo to bring the titles to North America. Xenoblade Chronicles and The Last Story were chosen for their pedigree, while Pandora's Tower was selected due to its unique mechanics {{and the fact that it}} was also published by Nintendo for the Wii. The team also decided on the titles as they were already confirmed for an English release in Europe and had received critical acclaim in Japan, so they avoided <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> for the release of critically and commercially unsuccessful games such as Earth Seeker. The campaign's title stemmed from the group's wish to inundate Nintendo of America with requests. Beginning in June 2011 on the message boards of gaming site IGN, it was met with support from the gaming community. Its campaign was spread across letters and emails to Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé, in addition to campaigns on Facebook and Twitter. Both physical and digital mediums were chosen for the campaign to make them more obvious and less able to be deleted, as a purely digital campaign would have been. To this end, letters and objects inspired by the titles were sent to Nintendo of America.|$|E

5|$|On May 12, 1898, the United States Navy bombarded San Juan, {{initiating}} the Puerto Rican Campaign. Initially, the Liberal Party supported the Spanish government, although several members agreed with Barbosa. Muñoz Rivera took possession of Chief of the Cabinet's {{position for the}} Autonomous Government on July 21. Four days later, on July 25, the United States Army landed in Guánica led by Nelson A. Miles, beginning the land offensive. On August 13, {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Paris was made public, bringing a halt to all military offensives in Puerto Rico. As part of this amnesty, Spain ceded Cuba and Puerto Rico, converting the archipelago into a possession of the United States under military governorship. The Barbosistas welcomed the American government, but Muñoz Rivera expected them to keep Puerto Rico as a possession. He refused to cooperate with the military government and returned to Barranquitas, where he wrote a poem titled Sísifo, comparing Puerto Rico's political situation to Sisyphus' punishment. He subsequently returned to San Juan, accepting a request made by John R. Brooke to continue in his office within the new cabinet. Muñoz Rivera assisted in establishing an insular police. Brooke was replaced by Guy Vernon Henry as military governor. Following this change, both men began having violent discussions, with each one <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> their positions. Muñoz Rivera would vocally debate several of Brooke's decisions, with both communicating via an interpreter.|$|E
25|$|Ahmed Rashid, {{writing in}} the Financial Times, stated that through the office Qatar has {{facilitated}} meetings between the Taliban and many countries and organisations, including the US state department, the UN, Japan, several European governments and non-governmental organisations, {{all of whom have}} been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> forward the idea of peace talks.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{heaviest}} fighting {{of the entire}} KDP-PUK civil war ensued starting October 13, 1997. Hundreds were killed and thousands displaced. PUK used six GRAD missiles in Suleymaniye. There were no negotiations to bring a truce. Same missiles were used against military targets in Turkey. From Turkey's perspective the KDP was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> PKK out of North Iraq and the KUP was getting support from the PKK which was supported by Syria and Iran. Turkey intervened {{on the side of}} the KDP and saw it as an opportunity to attack the PKK. Turkey also warned Talabani, the leader of PUK, not to cooperate with the PKK.|$|E
25|$|The Port of New York Authority {{opposed the}} plan, preferring a more forward-looking {{comprehensive}} freight distribution plan. They attacked Miller as <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the plan through without {{input from the}} Port Authority. The Port Authority wanted a system of inland terminals and belt-line railroads. According to Port Authority Chairman Julian Gregory, it was almost certain that NYCRR would not {{go along with the}} Port Authority plan. It was also believed that giving NYCRR elevated tracks on the west side would allow the railroad to monopolize freight and raise prices. The Port Authority believed it was primarily a freight problem, but NYCRR and New York City considered it to be a grade-crossing elimination project.|$|E
25|$|Conflict often {{develops}} between queens {{and workers}} of haplodiploid species because workers are more {{related to their}} sisters than their brothers or daughters. This results in them <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the sex ratio {{so that there are}} more females produced by the queen than males. At the same time, however, it is best for the queen to keep a 1:1 ratio of male and female offspring because she is equally related to both. D. media workers and queens have been observed policing worker laid eggs which helps to push the ratio more towards the females. This may help to keep worker-queen conflict from getting worse since workers do not produce many offspring in the nest.|$|E

25|$|Afterwards {{he wrote}} to Kiggell (5 July) {{stressing}} that “the road to success lies through deliberation” and that “nothing is to be gained but very much is to be lost by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> on too rapidly”. He recommended “concentration and not dispersion of artillery fire” and “the thing is to advance along a wide front, step by step to very limited and moderate objectives, and to forbid going beyond those objectives until all have been reached by the troops engaged”, and urging Kiggell “not to show this letter to anyone”. He again wrote to Kiggell (26 July) urging him not let the Germans “beat you in having the better manpower policy”.|$|E
25|$|When Marmont and Mortier {{arrived at}} La Ferté-Gaucher, they found Prince Wilhelm of Prussia's brigade {{blocking}} them. Prince Wilhelm was gradually reinforced by elements of Kleist's corps and the Prussian artillery soon dominated the numerically weaker French guns. After unsuccessfully <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the Prussians {{out of the}} way and learning that Pahlen's cavalry corps was approaching from the east, the French marshals decided they could only escape the trap by marching south to Provins. Far to the east, Napoleon scored a pointless victory over Wintzingerode in the Battle of Saint-Dizier on 26 March. The next day, the French emperor finally realized that the Allies had called his bluff and were advancing on Paris. He ordered his troops to march toward the capital, but it was too late.|$|E
25|$|The {{captain of}} the Loch Earn, after first {{sighting}} the Ville du Havre and realising she was dangerously close, rang the ship's bell and ported his helm. The helm of the Loch Earn was put to starboard, but Ville du Havre came right across the Loch Earn's bow. The Ville du Havre was violently shaken by the collision and noise, and woke all the passengers. Confused, most passengers went on deck, only to discover the ship was rapidly sinking. The captain assured them that all was fine, but in reality the cruiser had been nearly broken in two, and it didn't take long for passengers to realize the situation was desperate. Commotion and chaos overtook panicked passengers. They started grabbing life preservers and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> lifeboats into the water. Unfortunately, these had recently been painted, and they were now stuck fast to the deck. Finally {{a few of them}} were yanked loose, and passengers fought desperately {{to be one of the}} few travelers to board those rescue boats.|$|E

25|$|The Hood, which {{cannot be}} thrown or run with, is moved slowly by 'swaying', that is pushing and pulling the Hood and {{people within the}} 'Sway' toward the {{direction}} of their pub. Although everyone is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> in a particular direction, there are no real organised teams. The Sway makes very slow progress, as it snakes around, stopping quite often when it collapses, in order to pull bodies out, that became crushed into the mud. Safety is of prime concern {{and the whole thing}} is supervised by the Boggins. The Lord is referee and sees that the game is played fairly. At any one time there are usually around 200 people in the Sway and about one thousand people watching. Games can last anything from a couple of hours onwards and have been known to go on well into the night. Everything {{in the path of the}} Sway goes down before it, including hedges and walls. Another of the Boggins' jobs is to stop the Sway destroying everything in its path.|$|E
25|$|A {{major issue}} of the {{recording}} sessions was internal strife between band members, namely between Jenkins, and lead guitarist and co-founding band-member Kevin Cadogan. The two actively fought for ownership of the band; Cadogan, {{under the impression that}} the band was made as an equal partnership, was outraged to find that Jenkins had made legal changes to make Jenkins the sole owner of the band. Cadogan was further frustrated by Salazar's and Hargreaves' lack of understanding and indifference to the arrangement. The album was almost not made at all, as the band manager informed Cadogan that Jenkins was attempting to remove Cadogan from the band prior to even starting work on the album. Cadogan did everything he could to stay in the band, including <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> issues aside in order to just work on the album, having the band and sound engineer over to his home in order to record rough album ideas for two weeks. The sessions worked, but were very difficult, and ended up being the only period where the band worked together with one another. The rest of the album was recorded in solitude, with each member coming into the studio to record their parts of the album alone. The recording process spread itself across multiple other studios over time, one of which being one of the studios where Fleetwood Mac's Rumours had been recorded.|$|E

500|$|Vickers {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first career win {{in front of the}} crowd, earning $228,850 for the victory. Earnhardt was quick to forgive him for the last-lap accident: [...] "He didn't wreck anyone on purpose. He was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the 48. I don't think he thought, 'Oh, here's my chance to knock them both out.' He just got excited <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the 48." [...] Johnson was less sanguine: [...] "We had a great chance to make up some points and got crashed by a teammate... I was real patient until the white flag was up. I got a good run inside the 8 and got a lot of help from behind — too much help... Knowing the situation we're all in, I would hope someone would be a little more patient." [...] Johnson's crew chief, Chad Knaus, was annoyed: [...] "I just don't think [...] has the talent to understand what he has underneath him." ...|$|E
