500|$|A {{correspondent}} from The Daily Telegraph visited Ellen about 22months {{after she}} fell ill. He wrote:The girl's face {{is by no}} means cadaverous. There is flesh on the cheeks, which have a pinkish tint, and there is some colour in the thin lips. The eyes are calmly closed, as though in healthy sleep. I ventured to raise one of the lids and touch the eye beneath... but there was not even a quivering of the eyelash.... The girl's [...] was quite warm and moist, and the finger nails were neatly trimmed. The fingers are not the least bit stiffened... It is not a skeleton hand, neither are any of the girl's limbs so emaciated as, under the extraordinary circumstances alleged, might be expected.... The child's body is very thin as compared with her limbs.... There is not much substance in her flesh, however; it is soft and flabby... almost ice-cold.... As regards the child's breathing, it is so feeble that {{it is almost impossible to}} detect it; you cannot feel it by holding the cheek <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> and the only faintest flutter is felt when the hand is laid over the region of the heart.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first print}} depicts {{a pair of}} kappa river creatures raping an ama diver underwater. [...] Her hair flows with the running current, and small, {{seemingly}} curious fish swim near. [...] Another ama watches seated on a rock with an ashamed look, her right hand held <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> [...] Her drenched, dishevelled hair sticks to her. [...] She wears a red waistcloth, but her genitals can still be seen. [...] To the French art critic Edmond de Goncourt she [...] "appear languid and susceptible to temptation.|$|E
2500|$|From the woman's tsunokakushi headdress {{the scene}} is presumed to take place at a shrine; since the Meiji period (1868–1912), the tsunokakushi {{has come to be}} {{associated}} with Japanese weddings, but in the Edo period they were used for temple visits. [...] The picture suggests the visit was but a pretence for a secret tryst between what are probably servants in samurai mansions. [...] The young man leans toward the young woman, appearing to whisper in her ear, while the woman holds a wad of kaishi paper <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> [...] The ukiyo-e scholar [...] named the male [...] "Orisuke" [...] (...) , a nickname given to young male servants in the Edo period, but Yoshikazu Hayashi doubted the figure came from such a low rank.|$|E

60|$|Erlcort was not stopping, but {{she spoke}} so as <b>to</b> close <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{which she was}} apt to let hang open {{in a way that}} she did not like; she had <b>her</b> intimates pledged <b>to</b> tell <b>her</b> when she was doing it, but she could not make a man promise, and she had <b>to</b> look after <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> herself with Erlcort. It was not a bad mouth; her eyes were large, and it was merely large to match them.|$|R
2500|$|Due to the show's live factor, {{a number}} of {{technical}} problems, performer mishaps, intentional acts of sabotage by performers, protests, and cuts to dead air have occurred throughout the show's run. One incident that garnered widespread media coverage was the October 3, 1992, appearance by singer Sinéad O'Connor, in which she ripped up a photo of Pope John Paul II during her performance. On April 13, 1996, the alternative metal band Rage Against the Machine made a statement about the host, billionaire Steve Forbes, by hanging two upside-down American flags from their amplifiers. On October 23, 2004, Ashlee Simpson appeared as a musical guest, {{and there was a}} lip synching mishap. Her first performance, [...] "Pieces of Me", was performed without incident, but when she began her second song, [...] "Autobiography", the vocals for [...] "Pieces of Me" [...] were heard again through the speakers, even before she had raised the microphone <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Simpson began to do an impromptu jig, and then left the stage.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Gannett {{shook her}} head feebly. She still kept the {{handkerchief}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> eyes, but allowed a portion <b>to</b> drop over <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R

60|$|No {{sooner had}} the notes ceased than Kenneth sprang {{from behind a}} rock that had {{concealed}} him and grasped the child in his strong arms, trying <b>to</b> cover <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> {{at the same time}} <b>to</b> prevent <b>her</b> from crying out.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked across}} at him. Her eyebrows {{were a little}} raised, <b>her</b> eyes {{inclined}} <b>to</b> be misty, <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> tremulous.|$|R
60|$|He {{broke off}} in mild surprise, and stood gazing at Miss Ward, who, with her {{handkerchief}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> was rocking helplessly in her chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been strolling in the Walks and churchyard, father, till I {{feel quite}} leery." [...] She clapped her hand <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> but too late.|$|E

6000|$|... "Have {{you heard}} the Venusina?" [...] said Lady Corisande, with animation; [...] "I know nothing that I look forward to with more interest. But I was told she was not <b>to</b> open <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> until she {{appeared}} at the opera. Where did you hear her?" ...|$|R
60|$|Fancy put {{her hand}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> for half a minute. Underneath the palm of that little hand there existed for that half-minute a little yawn.|$|E
60|$|Bessie put {{her hand}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> and laughed at Mary Enderby with her slanted eyes; a sort of Parisian version of a Chinese motive in eyes.|$|E
60|$|She pointed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> {{and shook}} her head, to {{indicate}} {{that she could not}} speak. David leaped toward her, but she dropped before he could reach her.|$|E

60|$|There was {{no lack of}} guiding sounds now, for {{the moment}} Idazoo managed <b>to</b> clear <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> of the gag she began and {{continued}} a series of shrieks and yells which were intensified in vigour {{by the fact that}} she gradually became hysterical as well as wrathful.|$|R
5000|$|After Meier's death, the [...] "Josh Evans" [...] {{account was}} deleted, and Drew {{reportedly}} directed another minor {{who knew about}} Drew's activities <b>to</b> [...] "keep <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> shut".|$|R

60|$|Acquired {{notions of}} propriety are {{stronger}} than natural instincts.
