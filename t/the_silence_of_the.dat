5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs, a film {{adaptation}} of Harris' next Lecter novel, {{was released in}} 1991. However, none of the cast of Manhunter reprise their roles in the later film, although actors Frankie Faison and Dan Butler appear in both films as different and unrelated characters. <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs earned several awards and accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. It {{is one of only}} three films to have won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Screenplay. <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs was followed in turn by a sequel and two prequels: Hannibal, Red Dragon and Hannibal Rising, plus an NBC television series, Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|MGM (current {{holders of}} the rights to <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs and Hannibal) {{released}} the theatrical cut of Manhunter on DVD in a pan-and-scan format in 2004.

40|$|The {{locomotive}} horn is {{an effective}} deterrent to accidents at grade crossings. However, the noise associated with the locomotive horn is often a quality of life issue in populated areas where trains operate. This paper examines why the sound from the locomotive horn is both an effective audible alarm and source of community annoyance. This paper also reviews the various FRA approved Supplementary Safety Measures (SSMs) that may be installed at grade crossings to effect <b>the</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locomotive horn. This paper also discusses the Automatic Train Horn that, if approved by the FRA, will also result in <b>the</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locomotive horn. Finally, this paper presents and explains a methodology that evaluates the various SSMs to determine the most cost effective option at a grade crossing that results in <b>the</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locomotive horn.

5|$|Other stars {{subsequently}} cast included Ray Liotta as U.S. Justice Department official Paul Krendler (the character {{had appeared}} in <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs, but original actor Ron Vawter {{had died in the}} interim) and Italian actor Giancarlo Giannini as Detective Rinaldo Pazzi.

Hannibal broke box office records in the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom in February 2001, but was met with a mixed critical reception.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} {{recorded}} {{of the first}} twenty years of Egbert's reign, apart from campaigns against the Cornish in the 810s. The historian Richard Abels argues that <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was probably intentional, concealing Egbert's purge of Beorhtric's magnates and suppression of rival royal lines. Relations between Mercian kings and their Kentish subjects were distant. Kentish ealdormen {{did not attend the}} court of King Coenwulf, who quarrelled with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury (805–832) over the control of Kentish monasteries; Coenwulf's primary concern seems to have been {{to gain access to the}} wealth of Kent. His successors Ceolwulf I (821–23) and Beornwulf (823–26) restored relations with Archbishop Wulfred, and Beornwulf appointed a sub-king of Kent, Baldred.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{had been}} invited to stay at Tranby Croft, Yorkshire, the home of Arthur Wilson and his family. Among Edward's party were his advisers, Lord Coventry and Lieutenant-General Owen Williams; Gordon-Cumming, a friend of the prince, was also invited. On the first night the guests played baccarat, and Stanley Wilson thought he saw Gordon-Cumming {{illegally}} adding to his stake. Stanley informed other members of the Wilson family, and they agreed to watch him on the following evening. Gordon-Cumming was again seen to be acting in a suspicious manner. The family members asked the advice of the royal courtiers who, with the agreement of the prince, confronted Gordon-Cumming and pressured him into signing a document that declared he would never play cards again, in exchange for <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guests.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Glioma {{cells are}} {{characterized}} by their invasiveness and resistance to conventional therapeutics. <b>The</b> downregula-tion <b>of</b> human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) can lead to decreased cell proliferation and/or <b>the</b> induction <b>of</b> apoptotic cell death in cancer cells but has rarely been reported in glioma cells.

5|$|The {{concept for}} The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{arose in the}} early 1970s while Tobe Hooper was working as an {{assistant}} film director at the University of Texas at Austin and as a documentary cameraman. He had already developed a story involving the elements of isolation, the woods, and darkness. He credited the graphic coverage of violence by San Antonio news outlets as one inspiration for the film and based elements of the plot on serial killer Ed Gein in 1950s Wisconsin; Gein inspired other horror films such as Psycho (1960) and <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs (1991). During development, Hooper used the working titles of Headcheese and Leatherface.|$|E
5|$|The dump months {{evolved over}} the course of the 20th century. Although during the studio era most major {{releases}} followed annual patterns similar to today's, several classics like The Kid, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre were released during January. Since the decline of the studios, however, memorable films from the dump months have become rare exceptions. The most notable is <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs, a well-reviewed box office smash released in late January 1991 that went on to win that year's Academy Award for Best Picture. Several years before that, Dirty Dancing and Fatal Attraction became hits following releases in August and September respectively.|$|E
5|$|The film had a {{difficult}} and occasionally troubling pre-production history. When the novel was published in 1999, <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs director Jonathan Demme, screenwriter Ted Tally, and actress Jodie Foster all declined {{to be involved in}} its adaptation. Ridley Scott became attached as director after the success of Gladiator (2000), and eventually signed onto the project after reading the script pitched by Dino De Laurentiis, who produced Manhunter (1986), based on the 1981 Harris novel Red Dragon. After the departure of Foster and screenwriter Tally, Julianne Moore took on Foster's role while David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote the screenplay.|$|E

50|$|Developing an {{interest}} in film, Téodori collaborated on several screenplays for feature films, including Tom and Lola, <b>The</b> Shadow and <b>The</b> <b>Silences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Palace, and directed several short films.

5|$|Apart from a cameo role in {{the comedy}} The Ladies Man, Moore's only other {{appearance}} in 2000 was in a short-film adaptation of Samuel Beckett's play Not I. In early 2001, she appeared as FBI Agent Clarice Starling in Hannibal, a sequel to the Oscar winning film <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs. Jodie Foster had declined to reprise the role, and director Ridley Scott eventually cast Moore, over Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, Gillian Anderson, and Helen Hunt. The change in actress received considerable attention from the press, but Moore claimed she {{was not interested in}} upstaging Foster. Despite mixed reviews, Hannibal earned $58 million in its opening weekend and finished as the tenth-highest-grossing film of the year. Moore starred in three more 2001 releases: with David Duchovny in the science fiction–comedy Evolution, in her husband's dramatic film World Traveler, and with Kevin Spacey, Judi Dench, and Cate Blanchett in The Shipping News. All three films were poorly received.|$|E
5|$|Carter's initial {{pitch for}} The X-Files was {{rejected}} by Fox executives. He fleshed out the concept and returned a few weeks later, leading to the commission of the pilot. Carter worked with NYPD Blue producer Daniel Sackheim in further developing the pilot, drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1988 documentary The Thin Blue Line, and the English television series Prime Suspect. Inspiration was also taken from Carter's memories of watching Kolchak: The Night Stalker and The Twilight Zone in his youth; {{as well as from}} the then-recently released film <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs, which was the impetus for framing the series around agents from the FBI, in order to provide the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter believed was present in Kolchak. Carter was also keen on keeping the relationship between the two lead roles strictly platonic, basing their interactions on the characters of Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) and John Steed (Patrick Macnee) in the series The Avengers.|$|E
