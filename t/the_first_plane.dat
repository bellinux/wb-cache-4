5|$|Braathen SAFE Flight 139 was an {{aircraft}} hijacking {{that occurred in}} Norway on 21 June 1985. The incident took place on a Boeing 737-205 belonging to Braathens SAFE that was on a scheduled flight from Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The hijacker was Stein Arvid Huseby, who was drunk {{during most of the}} incident. It was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> hijacking to take place in Norway; there were no deaths and no injuries. Huseby was sentenced to three years prison and five years detention.|$|E
5|$|The first 737, LN-SUS, {{landed in}} Oslo on 8 January 1969, {{followed}} by LN-SUP on 31 January. Braathens SAFE was the launch customer of the F-28, and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> landed in Oslo on 3 March. Five F-28s were {{delivered in the}} course of a year, in addition to one aircraft that was leased periodically until 1971. There were several technical problems due to having the earliest models of the F-28, causing some operational difficulties. Two DC-6s were sold, and all but three of the F-27s were sold to Fokker between October 1968 and May 1969. Along with the aircraft came a new simulator, and the simulator division was moved from Sola to Fornebu. On 27 February 1970, the company took into use an IT-system, based at Sola.|$|E
5|$|Sir Douglas Mawson's air-tractor sledge was a {{converted}} fixed-wing aircraft {{taken on the}} 1911–14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> {{to be taken to}} the Antarctic. Expedition leader Douglas Mawson had planned to use the Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane as a reconnaissance and search and rescue tool, and to assist in publicity, but the aircraft crashed heavily during a test flight in Adelaide, Australia, only two months before Mawson's scheduled departure date. The plane was nevertheless sent south with the expedition, after having been stripped of its wings and metal sheathing from the fuselage. Engineer Frank Bickerton spent most of the 1912 winter working to convert it to a sledge, fashioning brakes from a pair of geological drills and a steering system from the plane's landing gear. It was first tested on 15November 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer sledging parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal.|$|E

5|$|Militants {{of unknown}} {{affiliation}} fired rockets at United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) planes on 8 June near Luena and again near Kuito {{a few days}} later. As <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane,</b> a Boeing 727, approached Luena someone shot a missile at the aircraft, damaging one engine but not critically as the three-man crew landed successfully. The plane's altitude, , most likely prevented the assailant from identifying his target. As the citizens of Luena had enough food to last them several weeks, the UNFWP temporarily suspended their flights. When the flights began again a few days later, militants shot at a plane flying to Kuito, the first attack targeting UN workers since 1999. The UNWFP again suspended food aid flights throughout the country. While he did not claim responsibility for the attack, UNITA spokesman Justino said the planes carried weapons and soldiers rather than food, making them acceptable targets. UNITA and the Angolan government both said the international community needed to pressure the other side into returning to the negotiating table. Despite the looming humanitarian crisis, neither side guaranteed UNWFP planes safety. Kuito, which had relied on international aid, only had enough food to feed their population of 200,000 {{until the end of}} the week. The UNFWP had to fly in all aid to Kuito and the rest of the Central Highlands because militants ambushed trucks. Further complicating the situation, potholes in the Kuito airport strip slowed aid deliveries. Overall chaos reduced the amount of available oil to the point at which the UN had to import its jet fuel.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> {{landed on}} 15 September 2015, {{with the first}} large {{passenger}} jet landing on 18 April 2016. The first regular commercial flight, carrying 78 passengers, landed at 13:15 GMT on 14 October 2017.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> {{landed in}} Yellow Grass on May 27, 1920, but no {{official}} airstrips have been established. The nearest municipal airport is in North Weyburn. Few {{farmers in the}} area have planes, as they are mainly used by crop spraying services.|$|E
50|$|In 1925, the Fleet Aeronautics Service (Servicio de Aeronáutica de la Armada) {{was created}} under Captain Atilio Frigerio, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Uruguayan pilot {{to obtain the}} brevet of Military Pilot (Aviano, Italy, 1912). <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>planes,</b> however, did not arrive until 1930.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>planes</b> to land {{here were}} before World War II - in the 1930s, just a mere 30 {{or so years}} after the Wright {{brothers}} made their historic first flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> {{landed at}} the site of the airport in 1912 and was flown by Harry Atwood, {{establishing}} a long distance flight record from Chicago, Il to Camillus. The airport expanded over the next few years and by 1925 became known as the Amboy Airport.|$|E
25|$|The initial A-3 Falcon {{order was}} placed in the winter of 1927 and {{delivery}} of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> was in October 1927. A total of 76 A-3s were received. Later, six aircraft were modified as pilot trainers with dual controls and redesignated A-3A. A second batch of 78 improved A-3Bs, based on the Curtiss O-1E, was purchased beginning in 1929.|$|E
25|$|On September 6, 1982, the {{governor}} of Kumamoto Prefecture announced plans for a small airport during a regular press conference. On December 26, 1990, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport approved {{the construction of the}} airfield. Construction began in 1992. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> that landed at this airport was a DHC-8 of Amakusa Airlines on November 19, 1999. The airfield was opened for public use on March 23, 2000.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> {{prototype}} Eurofighter <b>planes</b> {{used the}} RB199 engine, until in June 1995 when <b>the</b> <b>first</b> EJ200-engined <b>plane</b> {{took off from}} Turin. Its predecessor, the British Aerospace EAP, also used the engines.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>planes</b> were a {{small number}} of Handley Page Type O/400 bombers {{modified}} for passenger use. These flew London-Paris. At a request from the Air Ministry the Handley Page Type W8 was later used for both Paris and Brussels.|$|R
25|$|In March 1956, the Civil Aeronautics Board {{approved}} routes out of Tucson for Trans World Airlines (TWA), {{in spite}} of opposition from the already established American Airlines but it wouldn't be until December of that year that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>planes</b> began service.|$|R
25|$|In 1991, Clark Air Base in the Philippines was {{evacuated}} due to {{the eruption}} of Mount Pinatubo. By 16 June, the evacuation order was issued and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> load of evacuees arrived at McChord on the 18th. In 1992, with the disestablishment of Military Airlift Command, McChord became an Air Mobility Command base. In November of that same year, two McChord C-141 Starlifters, participating in an air refueling training mission over north central Montana, collided in mid-air, killing all 13 crewmen.|$|E
25|$|While {{the final}} project was being prepared, the Portuguese Department of Defense {{authorized}} immediate {{execution of the}} first work, that included a runway to service planes transferred from Lajes Airfield, carrying with them the technicians and equipment. Along {{with a team of}} little more than 40 workers, Lieutenant Engineer Correia de Sousa concluded the runway construction. On 8 August 1944, at about 2:15p.m., <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> landed on the runway, a Douglas C-47 Skytrain (Dakota C-47) operated by the US Air Force, transporting materials and bread from Terceira. It departed an hour later.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} {{believes that}} the target of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> was either the Sri Lanka Air Force Headquarters, which was adjacent to the Inland Revenue Department building, or the President's House or Army Headquarters, which were also in the area. However, after the aircraft was hit, the pilot lost control and crashed into the IRD building. The second aircraft {{is believed to have}} targeted aircraft hangars at the Air Force base at Katunayake. Given the amount of explosives packed inside the aircraft, there could have been severe devastation if they had hit their targets.|$|E
50|$|Hamilton Field was {{originally}} a bomber installation. On May 5, 1934, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>planes</b> assigned to Hamilton were Martin B-10 and B-12 bombers of the 7th Bombardment Group, having been transferred from March Airfield.

Belafonte went on the Today Show to promote the album on September 11, 2001, and was interviewed by Katie Couric just minutes before <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> hit the World Trade Center. The album was nominated for the 2002 Grammy Awards for Best Boxed Recording Package, for Best Album Notes, and for Best Historical Album.|$|E
25|$|USAir was {{a launch}} {{customer}} for the Boeing 737-300, as the airline needed an aircraft with greater capacity to serve its rapidly growing Florida markets. USAir was the world's largest operator of DC-9 aircraft {{at the time}} and approached McDonnell Douglas to negotiate a new airplane design. However, in the late 1970s, the McDonnell Douglas' proposed successor to the DC-9-50 did not suit USAir's requirements. After the negotiations with McDonnell Douglas broke down, Boeing came forward with a proposed variant of the 737. USAir selected the new 737 aircraft and the company worked closely with Boeing during its development, taking delivery of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> on November 28, 1984.|$|E
25|$|Braathens South American & Far East Airtransport A/S {{was founded}} on 26 March 1946 by Ludvig G. Braathen through his {{shipping}} company Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi and its holding company Braganza. Braathens had made good money during World War II with the participation in the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Mission. His initial intentions were to fly crew and supplies to his and others ships throughout the world—primarily in the Far East. Braathen traveled to the United States, where he bought several used 44-passenger Douglas C-54 (DC-4) aircraft from the United States Air Force. Twenty pilots were recruited and sent to Fort Worth for certification. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane,</b> LN-HAV Norse Explorer, landed at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen on 26 December 1946.|$|E

25|$|On August 23, 1952, a bi-plane piloted by Charles McKay and John Pretner {{took off}} from the island airport and crashed in the {{backyard}} of a home on Markham Street, near Dundas Street West in Toronto. Both men {{were killed in the}} crash and ensuing fire. The plane was used by owner Charles Catalano's Aerial Advertising Service to pull signs behind it over the annual Canadian National Exhibition (CNE). It was not pulling a sign {{at the time of the}} crash. McKay was a pilot for Catalano and Pretner was his guest aboard the plane. According to Catalano, the plane had passed an airworthiness test two weeks previous. According to witnesses, the pilot appeared to lose control of the plane when it went down. According to Donald Saunders, the Ontario District Air Regulations supervisor at the time, it was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> crash within Toronto since the island airport opened in 1938.|$|E
25|$|On September 11, 2001, {{the station}} was shut down by the Port Authority after the first {{airplane}} hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center. In the minutes after <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> hit at 8:46am, three PATH trains were pulling into the station. One was arriving from Newark and two others from Hoboken. The first Hoboken train turned around without stopping, not letting off passengers or opening any doors. The second Hoboken train arrived on track 3 at 8:52 a.m., was ordered to be evacuated, employees included. This train never left the World Trade Center complex and was found later in 2001 during the long recovery process. The train from Newark that came into the terminal at 8:55 a.m. stopped only to pick up passengers. An empty train {{was sent to the}} station at 9:10 a.m. to pick up a dozen PATH employees and a homeless individual, leaving the station empty.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} planes {{belong to the}} subtle sphere, the fourth is on the {{threshold}} between the subtle and the mental spheres and the fifth and sixth planes are in the mental sphere. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> starts from {{the threshold of the}} gross and the subtle sphere. The soul here starts experiencing subtle phenomena simultaneously through its gross and subtle senses. It starts hearing subtle sounds and smelling subtle scents, although their nature is far different from their gross equivalents. Eventually it starts perceiving the subtle world through its subtle body and so comes to the second plane. Here the soul becomes aware of infinite energy and can perform minor miracles, like stopping moving objects or filling dried wells with fresh water. Being not conscious of the gross world its experience gives rise only to subtle impressions of the sights, scents and sounds of the subtle world. Further involution of consciousness makes the soul experience the third plane. Here the soul can use more aspects of the infinite energy by performing greater miracles, such as giving sight to the blind, or restoring maimed limbs.|$|E
