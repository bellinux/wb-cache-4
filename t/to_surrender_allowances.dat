5000|$|Adopt a {{regulation}} requiring the mandatory reporting {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions. In December 2007, the Board adopted {{a regulation}} requiring the largest industrial sources to report and verify their greenhouse gas emissions. The reporting regulation serves as a solid foundation to determine greenhouse gas emissions and track future changes in emission levels. In 2011, the Board adopted the cap-and-trade regulation. The cap-and-trade program covers major sources of GHG emissions in the State such as refineries, power plants, industrial facilities, and transportation fuels. The cap-and-trade program includes an enforceable emissions cap that will decline over time. The State will distribute allowances, which are trad-able permits, equal to the emissions allowed under the cap. Sources under the cap will need <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>allowances</b> and offsets equal to their emissions {{at the end of}} each compliance period.|$|E
30|$|In July 2008, the European Council and the European Parliament {{agreed to}} include {{international}} aviation into the existing EU Emissions Trading Scheme for {{the limitation of}} CO 2 -emissions. The Directive came into force in February 2009 [8]. Aircraft operators will be obliged <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>allowances</b> for virtually all commercial flights into, within {{or out of the}} EU from 2012 onwards. The EU-ETS will affect both European and third-country airlines. The European Commission justifies this approach by stating that a distortion of competition in the international airline sector needs to be avoided to the most possible extent and that this approach will improve the environmental effectiveness of the scheme. Several non-EU states, however, have expressed doubts regarding the environmental effectiveness of the EU-ETS and whether the EU approach conforms to international law.|$|E
40|$|Border {{adjustments}} {{are currently}} discussed {{to limit the}} possible adverse impact of climate policies on competitiveness and carbon leakage. We discuss the main choices {{that will have to}} be made if the European Union implements such a system alongside the EU ETS. Although more analysis is required on some issues, on others some design options seem clearly preferable to others. First, the import adjustment should be a requirement <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>allowances</b> rather than a tax. Second, the general rule to determine the amount of allowances per ton imported should be the product-specific benchmarks that the European Commission is currently elaborating for a different purpose (i. e. to determine the amount of free allowances). Third, this obligation should apply when the imported product is registered at the EU border, and not after the end of the year as is the case for domestic emitters. Fourth, the export adjustment should take the form of a rebate on the amount of allowances a domestic emitter has to surrender. Five, this rebate should equal the above-mentioned product-specific benchmarks, not the emissions of the particular exporting plant or firm. Finally, the adjustment does not have to apply to consumer products but mostly to basic products. Carbon leakage Border adjustment EU ETS...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} leakage from sub-national climate policies using California’s capand-trade {{program as}} a representative example. Our analysis is built on a global model of economic activity and energy systems that identifies 15 US regions and 15 regions {{in the rest of}} the world. As California’s cap-and-trade policy requires electricity importers <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> emissions <b>allowances,</b> leakage depends on the ability of out-of-state generators to reconfigure transmission to reduce the carbon intensity of electricity supplied to California. If exporters can dispatch carbon-free electricity to California and carbon-intensive electricity is rerouted to other markets, leakage is 47 % of the decrease in emissions in California. If exporters are unable to adjust the carbon intensity of electricity supplied to California, as imported electricity is relatively carbon intensive, there is negative leakage to regions supplying electricity to California and the aggregate leakage rate is 5 %. We also observe negative leakage to some regions due to changes in fossil fuel prices and that the impact of the trading of emissions permits between California and the EU depends on the ability of out-of-state generators to reconfigure electricity supply...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project examines {{the impact of}} the European Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) on firm performance and green investments. The European Union (EU) launched the EU ETS, which can be considered as the cornerstone of the EU climate policy, in 2005. The EU ETS was the first and is to date the biggest international system for trading greenhouse gas emission allowances, covering almost half of the EU’s greenhouse emissions and operating in 31 countries (European Commission, 2013) [1]. The idea of the EU ETS is that carbon-intensive companies have <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>allowances</b> equivalent to the number of carbon emissions caused by their installations. Companies with excess allowances can sell their surplus allowances on the market and analogously, companies can buy allowances if their abatement price is above the EU permit price (Hoffmann, 2007). The contribution of this {{research project}} is threefold. First, we contribute to the limited literature regarding the EU ETS determinants of firm value and investing behaviour (e. g., Jong et al., 2014). Second, we provide more insights into the economic and environmental effectiveness of the system (e. g., Schmidt & Heitzig, 2013). From these insights, important policy implications can be derived. Finally, we add to the literature on the value link with pollution {{within the context of a}} mandatory emission trading scheme. This link has up until now mainly been studied in the context of voluntary disclosure programs (e. g., Lee et al., 2013). [1] The EU ETS operates in the 28 EU countries and the 3 EEA-EFTA states (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|CGE {{models have}} been used {{over the last decade}} to {{establish}} the economic and environmental effectiveness of adopting different BAMs such as export rebates, carbon or ‘green’ tariffs, production rebates and forcing importers <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> carbon <b>allowances</b> in a cap-and-trade system. Mckibbin and Wilcoxen (2009) used the G-Cubed model to examine how large green tariffs (i.e., import border adjustments) would need to be to offset the costs of adopting climate policies and whether the tariffs are effective in combating competitive disadvantage and reducing carbon leakage. Their study focussed on the USA and Europe under various climate policy scenarios. They found that the effects of such tariffs would be small in protecting the domestic import competing sector and would reduce leakage very modestly. Bernard and Vielle (2009), in analyzing the EU emissions trading system (ETS), found that carbon leakage may affect some specific sectors while the aggregate impact would be rather small. Kuik and Hofkes (2010) also explored some implications of BAMs in the EU ETS and concluded that some sectors may benefit, but from and environmental point of view, BAMs are not a very effective measure.|$|R

50|$|Late on 6 May, Wainwright asked Homma for {{terms of}} {{surrender}}. Homma insisted that surrender include all Allied {{forces in the}} Philippines. Believing that {{the lives of all}} those on Corregidor would be endangered, Wainwright accepted. On 8 May, he sent a message to Sharp, ordering him <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> the Visayan-Mindanao Force. Sharp complied, but many individuals carried on the fight as guerrillas. Few unit commanders were so hard pressed as to be forced <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> and none had any desire <b>to</b> <b>surrender.</b> Gen. Sharp's decision <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> involved many factors. Major Larry S. Schmidt, in a 1982 master's degree thesis, said Gen. Sharp's decision <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> was based on two reasons. According to Schmidt, the first was that the Japanese were capable of executing the 10,000 survivors of Corregidor. The second, he said, was because Sharp now knew his forces would not be reinforced by the United States as had been previously thought.|$|R
