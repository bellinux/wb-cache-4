5|$|The {{continuing}} publicity surrounding Mansfield's {{physical appearance}} failed to sustain her career. Fox {{gave her a}} leading role opposite Kenneth More in The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw (1958), a western comedy filmed on location in England. In the film Mansfield sang three songs, but the studio had her voiced dubbed by singer Connie Francis. When the film was released in the United States in 1959, it was Mansfield's last mainstream film success. Mansfield was offered a part opposite James Stewart and Jack Lemmon in the romantic comedy Bell, Book and Candle (1958), but had to <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> because of her pregnancy. Thereafter, Fox attempted to cast Mansfield opposite Paul Newman in Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys! (1958), his ill-fated first attempt at comedy. After intense lobbying by Newman and Joanne Woodward, however, she was replaced by Mansfield's Wayward Bus co-star Joan Collins.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} of the University of Oregon in Eugene, William Beaty Boyd, had been a senior administrator at the University of California in Berkeley in 1966 when his campus was considered for a location of the film The Graduate. After he consulted with other senior administrative colleagues who advised him to <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> {{due to the lack}} of artistic merit, the college campus scenes set at Berkeley were shot at USC in Los Angeles. The film went on to become a classic, and Boyd was determined not to make the same mistake twice when the producers inquired about filming at Oregon. After consulting with student government leaders and officers of the Pan Hellenic Council, the Director of University Relations advised the president that the script, although raunchy and often tasteless, was a very funny spoof of college life. Boyd even allowed the filmmakers to use his office as Dean Wormer's.|$|E
