5000|$|Butyrate {{produces}} different {{effects in}} healthy and cancerous cells; {{this is known}} as the [...] "butyrate paradox". In particular, butyrate inhibits colonic tumor cells and promotes healthy colonic epithelial cells. The signaling mechanism is not well understood. A review suggested that the chemopreventive benefits of butyrate depend in part on the amount, time of exposure with respect to the <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>process,</b> and type of fat in the diet. The production of volatile fatty acids such as butyrate from fermentable fibers may contribute to the role of dietary fiber in colon cancer. Short-chain fatty acids, which include butyric acid, are produced by beneficial colonic bacteria (probiotics) that feed on, or ferment prebiotics, which are plant products that contain adequate amounts of dietary fiber. These short-chain fatty acids benefit the colonocytes by increasing energy production and cell proliferation, and may protect against colon cancer.|$|E
40|$|DNAzymes (synthetic {{catalytic}} DNA) {{have emerged}} as {{a new class of}} nucleic acid-based gene silencing agent. Using DNAzymes targeting the human mRNA of the immediate-early gene and C 2 H 2 -class zinc finger transcription factor early growth response- 1 (EGR- 1), we demonstrate here that EGR- 1 plays an indispensable role in breast cancer proliferation, migration, chemoinvasion and xenograft growth in nude mice. DNAzyme inhibition of these <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>processes</b> and EGR- 1 protein expression in breast carcinoma cells is sequence-specific and EGR- 1 transcription-independent. These agents inhibit breast carcinoma cell migration and chemoinvasion in microchemotaxis chambers and solid tumour growth in athymic nude mice. Thus, DNAzymes targeting specific genes can inhibit multiple key <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>processes</b> in vitro and in vivo and may serve as useful anti-cancer agents...|$|R

A recent study from Smalley's group demonstrates that targeting an inactivating Brca 1 mutation to the luminal progenitors could yield basal-like breast cancers.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} whether the side population (SP) cells possess cancer stem cell-like characteristics in vitro {{and the role}} of SP cells in <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>process</b> in gastric cancer. METHODS: We analyzed the presence of SP cells in different human gastric carcinoma cell lines, and then isolated and identified the SP cells from the KATO III human gastric cancer cell line by flow cytometry. The clonogenic ability and self-renewal were evaluated by clone and sphere formation assays. The related genes were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. To compare tumorigenic ability, SP and non-side population (NSP) cells from the KATO III human gastric cancer cell line were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. RESULTS: SP cells from the total population accounted for 0. 57 % in KATO III, 1. 04 % in Hs- 746 T, and 0. 02 % in AGS (CRL- 1739). SP cells could grow clonally and have self-renewal capability in conditioned media. The expression of ABCG 2, MDRI, Bmi- 1 and Oct- 4 was different between SP and NSP cells. However, there was no apparent difference between SP and NSP cells when they were injected into nude mice. CONCLUSION: SP cells have some cancer stem cell-like characteristics in vitro and can be used for studying the <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>process</b> in gastric cancer...|$|E

The application of fractal geometry to the measurement of liver vascularity and the availability of a computer-aided quantitative method can eliminate errors in visual interpretation, and make it possible to obtain closer-to-reality numerals that are compulsory for any measurement process...|$|R
40|$|An {{apparently}} unique circulating common oncofoetal protein {{has been}} identified in rat small-bowel, colonic and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. The tumours were induced by ionizing radiation (small bowel), an alkyl hydrocarbon, 1, 2 -dimethylhydrazine (colon) and a polyaromatic hydrocarbon, 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (pancreas). The oncofoetal protein was identified {{by the use of}} specific xenogenic antitumour rabbit sera generated to the X-ray-induced neoplasm. In addition, the foetal protein was also found always to occur in the liver and lungs of those animals bearing the chemically induced tumours as well as in their serum.

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that fish oil- and pectin-containing (FO/P) diets protect against colon cancer compared with corn oil and cellulose (CO/C) by upregulating apoptosis and suppressing proliferation. To elucidate the mechanisms whereby FO/P diets induce apoptosis and suppress proliferation during the <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>process,</b> we analyzed the temporal gene expression profiles from exfoliated rat colonocytes. Rats consumed diets containing FO/P or CO/C and were injected with azoxymethane (AOM; 2 times, 15 mg/kg body weight, subcutaneously). Feces collected at initiation (24 h after AOM injection) and at aberrant crypt foci (ACF) (7 wk postinjection) and tumor (28 wk postinjection) stages of colon cancer were used for poly (A) + RNA extraction. Gene expression signatures were determined using Codelink arrays. Changes in phenotypes (ACF, apoptosis, proliferation, and tumor incidence) were measured to establish the regulatory controls contributing to the chemoprotective effects of FO/P. At initiation, FO/P downregulated the expression of 3 genes involved with cell adhesion and enhanced apoptosis compared with CO/C. At the ACF stage, the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation was modulated by FO/P and the zone of proliferation was reduced in FO/P rats compared with CO/C rats. FO/P also increased apoptosis and the expression of genes that promote apoptosis at the tumor endpoint compared with CO/C. We conclude {{that the effects of}} chemotherapeutic diets on epithelial cell gene expression can be monitored noninvasively throughout the <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>process</b> and that a FO/P diet is chemoprotective in part due to its ability to affect expression of genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation throughout all stages of tumorigenesis...|$|E

BCAR 4 binding of SNIP 1 and PNUTS in response to CCL 21 releases the SNIP 1 ’s inhibition of p 300 -dependent histone acetylation, which in turn enables the BCAR 4 -recruited PNUTS to bind H 3 K 18 ac and relieve inhibition of RNA Pol II via activation of the PP 1 phosphatase. This mechanism activates a noncanonical Hedgehog/GLI 2 transcriptional program that promotes cell migration. BCAR 4 expression correlates with advanced breast cancers, and therapeutic delivery of locked nucleic acids (LNAs) targeting BCAR 4 strongly suppresses breast cancer metastasis in mouse models.

Many studies demonstrated that eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 A 2 (eIF 5 A 2) serves as a proliferation-related oncogene in <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>processes.</b> Methods: The present study used cell viability assays, EdU incorporation assays, western blot, and immunofluorescence to explore whether N 1 -guanyl- 1, 7 -diaminoheptane (GC 7), which inhibits eIF 5 A 2 activation, exerts synergistic cytotoxicity with doxorubicin in breast cancer. Results: We found that GC 7 enhanced doxorubicin cytotoxicity in ER-negative HCC 1937 cells but had little effect in ER-positive MCF- 7 and Bcap- 37 cells. Administration of GC 7 reversed the doxorubicin-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ER-negative breast cancer cells. Knockdown of eIF 5 A 2 by siRNA inhibited the doxorubicin-induced EMT in ER-negative HCC 1937 cells.

However, multiple integrin antagonist drug candidates have failed to show efficacy in cancer clinical trials. In this work, we instead exploit these integrins as a target for antibody Fc effector functions {{in the context of}} cancer immunotherapy. By combining administration of an engineered mouse serum albumin/IL- 2 fusion with an Fc fusion to an integrin-binding peptide (2. 5 F-Fc), significant survival improvements are achieved in three syngeneic mouse tumor models, including complete responses with protective immunity. Functional integrin antagonism does not contribute significantly to efficacy; rather, this therapy recruits both an innate and adaptive immune response, as deficiencies in either arm result in reduced tumor control. Administration of this integrin-targeted immunotherapy together with an anti-PD- 1 antibody further improves responses and predominantly results in cures. Overall, this well-tolerated therapy achieves tumor specificity by redirecting inflammation to a functional target fundamental to <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>processes</b> but expressed at significantly lower levels in healthy tissues, and it shows promise for translation...|$|R

To identify possible common regulatory networks involved in WISP 1 and CTGF gene expression, their genomic regions were searched for common transcription factor motifs using a combination of in silico approaches and documented knowledge concerning pancreas development. This analysis revealed the presence of a conserved enhancer in both CTGF and WISP 1 regulatory regions in 10 species covering a wide evolutionary distance. This enhancer contains binding sites for Ngn 1 / 3 (NEUROG 1 / 3) and transcription factors that are critically involved in pancreas development.
