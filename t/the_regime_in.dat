Ngalula approached Kankolongo to lead a mutiny and coup d'état against Kalonji.|$|E
5|$|Following the pagoda raids, the United States {{terminated}} {{funding to}} Tung's men {{because they were}} used as a political tool rather than against the communists. Along with Diệm and Nhu, Tung was assassinated during the November 1963 coup. Nhu and Tung had been preparing a fake coup and counter-coup {{in order to give}} a false demonstration of the regime's strength. However, the pair were unaware that General Tôn Thất Đính, who was planning the phony operation, was involved in the real coup plot. Đính tricked Tung into sending his men into the countryside, leaving <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> <b>in</b> Saigon without the protection of the special forces. This led to the easy overthrow of the regime.|$|E

25|$|The secular {{clergy and}} the {{remaining}} regular clergy, fearing possible royal action against them, began to speak against <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> <b>in</b> sermons and other public acts.

In February 1980, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations stated that Bahá'ís were SAVAK agents and repeated the cleric's charges; only later when he broke with <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> <b>in</b> 1982 did he recant his previous statements.|$|E

The mayor at the time, , condemned the Vichy regime and the camp in his hometown, where he made sure that children interned with their mother followed a normal education. His hostile words and acts to <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> <b>in</b> place led him to be removed from his post in 1941. He then joined Resistance where {{he became one of the}} leaders for the Lozère.
