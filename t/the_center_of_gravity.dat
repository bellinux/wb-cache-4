5|$|In {{contrast}} to the forelimbs, the three-toed hindlimbs were long and thick, supporting the body in a bipedal posture. The long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso and placed <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> over the hips.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{authors have}} {{proposed}} functions {{to quantify the}} degree of similarity between two fuzzy numbers using various descriptive parameters, such as the geometric distance, the distance between <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> or <b>the</b> perimeter. However, these similarity functions have drawback for specific situations. We propose a new similarity measure for generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers aimed at overcoming such drawbacks. This new measure accounts for the distance between <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> and <b>the</b> geometric distance but also incorporates a new term based on the shared area between the fuzzy numbers. The proposed measure is compared against other measures in the literature...|$|R

5|$|Daspletosaurus {{shared the}} same body form as other tyrannosaurids, with a short, S-shaped neck {{supporting}} the massive skull. It walked on its two thick hindlimbs, which ended in four-toed feet, although the first digit (the hallux) did not contact the ground. In contrast, the forelimbs were extremely small and bore only two digits, although Daspletosaurus had the longest forelimbs in proportion to body size of any tyrannosaurid. A long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso, with <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> over the hips.|$|E
5|$|Now that Vietnam was unified, <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> of {{the country}} moved further south, {{following}} centuries of southerly migration and conquest, so Gia Long moved the seat of government from Hanoi to Huế. Gia Long rebuilt the old citadel of Phú Xuân into a fortress stronghold. The structure was a square shape of 2.5km per side. A 9m rampart was encased with masonry and protected by protruding bastions, each defended by 36 guns. The exterior and interior were flanked and reinforced {{by a series of}} moats. The citadel's defenders included an 800-strong elephant troop. The new palace structure, protocol and court dress were all taken directly from Qing Dynasty styles, and his palace and fortress was intended to be a smaller copy of the Chinese Forbidden City in the 1800s.|$|E
5|$|The first XFR-1 {{made its}} first flight on 25 June 1944 without its jet engine, but that was {{installed}} shortly afterward. The second prototype first flew on 20 September 1944. Test flights confirmed wind tunnel tests that revealed a lack of longitudinal stability because <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> had been miscalculated. In addition, the circular rear fuselage of the FR-1 gave less stability than the slab-style fuselage of the Grumman F4F Wildcat that {{was used as a}} model for the stability calculations. A new tail with enlarged vertical and horizontal stabilizers was designed and retrofitted to the prototypes. The original Douglas double-slotted flaps proved to be unsatisfactory during flight testing, but all three prototypes and the first 14 production aircraft were built with them before they were replaced with a single-slotted flap.|$|E

5|$|On {{cross-country}} flights on {{days when}} strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity,</b> which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{similarity}} of the IAe-27a and Tank's redesign of the Ta 183, Juan Ignacio San Martín, {{the director of the}} Institute merged the two parallel projects as the IAe 33 Pulqui II. The fuselage of Tank's design was further adapted to use the IAe-27a's undercarriage. The shoulder-mounted, negative-incidence wings were swept back 40°, an even greater sweep angle than that of the Ta 183, and given a small amount of anhedral. Comparable to the Ta 183's engine placement, the Nene engine was situated aft of the cockpit, near <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> with engine maintenance and service facilitated through the removal of the tail section. The airframe featured a graceful, 50° swept-back T-shaped empennage and a pressurized cockpit topped by a clear bubble-type canopy, faired into the dorsal fuselage. Armor was provided around the cockpit and a bulletproof windscreen was incorporated. Fuel capacity was initially 1,250 l (275 Imp. gal.) internally and 800 l (176 Imp. gal.) in the wings. Armament was planned to include four 20mm cannon, a pair mounted in a staggered, near-ventral position along each side of the fuselage slightly set back from the jet intake.|$|E
5|$|The postcranial {{skeleton}} of Majungasaurus closely resembles those of Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus, {{the only other}} abelisaurid genera for which complete skeletal material is known. Majungasaurus was bipedal, with a long tail to balance out the head and torso, putting <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> over the hips. Although the cervical (neck) vertebrae had numerous cavities and excavations (pleurocoels) to reduce their weight, they were robust, with exaggerated muscle attachment sites and ribs that interlocked for strength. Ossified tendons attached to the cervical ribs, giving them a forked appearance, as seen in Carnotaurus. All of these features resulted in a very strong and muscular neck. Uniquely, the cervical ribs of Majungasaurus had long depressions along the sides for weight reduction. The humerus (upper arm bone) was short and curved, closely resembling those of Aucasaurus and Carnotaurus. Also like related dinosaurs, Majungasaurus had very short forelimbs with four extremely reduced digits, first reported with only two very short external fingers and no claws. The hand and finger bones of Majungasaurus, like other majungasaurines, lacked the characteristic pits and grooves where claws and tendons would normally attach, and its finger bones were fused together, indicating that the hand was immobile. In 2012, a better specimen was described, showing that the lower arm was robust, though short, and that the hand contained four metatarsals and four, probably inflexible and very reduced, fingers, with small claws on {{the second and third}} finger. The phalanx formula was 1-2-2-1-0.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an application of}} laser holography and image processing for measuring partic 1 e locations. It is known that the reconstructed images of objects expand in the depth direction of the object beam， when laser holography is applied to recording partic 1 es in 3 -D (Three-Dimensional) space. The present study employs a method for simple optica 1 layout {{in order to measure}} partic 1 e locations and velocities in 3 -D space. The calibration was done for measuring <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>of</b> partic 1 e locations. The present ca 1 ibration method was confirmed to be usefu 1. The 2 -D cross-section image of the partic 1 e was extracted from the constructed images by a screen projection method. The following two methods are proposed. (A) Object shapes are reconstructed from large number of 2 -D images (a stack of x-y cross-sections， i. e. slices of the depth direction of the object beam) in 3 -D space by using binarization and a 3 -D labeling process. Then， <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> partic 1 es are determined from the 2 -D x-y， y-z， and x-z cross-sections by the moment method. (B) The partic 1 e mask correlation method is applied to 2 -D images to obtain <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>of</b> partic 1 es， and then <b>the</b> 3 -D <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> are obtained. <b>The</b> two methods were compared. It was seen that "method A" was effective for the measurement of large partic 1 es (the size of the partic 1 e was greater than about 20 pixels) and the measurement of the partic 1 e size. It was found {{that it was possible to}} obtain <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> with "method B" without being affected by the change of brightness distribution in the background， and that the method had advantages with respectto the measurement of small partic 1 es (the size of the partic 1 es was less than about 20 pixels). Moreover， 3 -D velocity vectors of partic 1 es in liquid were measured using double exposure holography...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{computational}} model {{that provides a}} unified account of inference, coherence, and disambiguation. It simulates how the build-up of coherence in text leads to the knowledge-based resolution of referential ambiguity. Possible interpretations of an ambiguity are represented by <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> in a high-dimensional space. The unresolved ambiguity forms a vector in the same space. This vector is attracted by <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity,</b> while also being affected by context information and world knowledge. When the vector reaches one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity,</b> <b>the</b> ambiguity is resolved to the corresponding interpretation. The model accounts for reading time and error rate data from experiments on ambiguous pronoun resolution and explains the effects of context informativeness, anaphor type, and processing depth. It shows how implicit causality can have an early effect during reading. A novel prediction is that ambiguities can remain unresolved if there is insufficient disambiguating information...|$|R
