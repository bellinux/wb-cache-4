50|$|On mass-produced clothing, {{the seam}} {{allowances}} of plain seams are usually trimmed and stitched {{together with an}} overlock stitch using a serger. Plain seams may also be pressed open, with each seam allowance separately secured with an overlock stitch. Traditional home sewing techniques for finishing plain seams include <b>trimming</b> with pinking <b>shears,</b> oversewing with a zig-zag stitch, and hand or machine overcasting.|$|R
40|$|Syzygium myrtifolium (Roxb.) Walp. is {{a popular}} {{landscape}} plant in Malaysia. This species is always planted as hedge plant and topiary. However, it requires frequent trimming to maintain its form and aesthetic functions as it grows vigorously. Conventional trimming technique by using <b>trimming</b> <b>shear</b> or <b>trimming</b> machine is currently practiced in landscape maintenance which is time consuming, labour intensive and costly. Therefore, a {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effects of a plant growth retardant, paclobutrazol, on the growth and physiological response of S. myrtifolium. The plants were planted in polyethylene bags sized 33 cm in height Ã— 27 cm in diameter and filled with soil, organic matter and sand (3 : 2 : 1). Paclobutrazol at rates of 0, 1. 25, 2. 50 and 3. 75 g L- 1 were soil drenched at 30 days after the plants were trimmed and new shoots were produced. Paclobutrazol significantly reduced plant height and leaf area but increased the leaf area index. Reduced photosynthetic rates were recorded with the treated plants as compared to the control plants. In addition, paclobutrazol at 3. 75 g L- 1 significantly reduced the transpiration rate as compared with the control plants and plants treated with 1. 25 g L- 1 of paclobutrazol. However, stomatal conductance was not affected significantly by paclobutrazol. The growth inhibition effect of paclobutrazol reduced the trimming activity in S. myrtifolium. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurement indicated that physiological processes in the paclobutrazol-treated plants were not affected. Paclobutrazol is concluded to offer a better approach in maintaining the growth of S. myrtifolium...|$|R
5000|$|It has a {{distinctive}} curly coat which is woolly in texture and may form cords when long. The coat {{should not be}} clipped or groomed for aesthetic purposes. Instead, it should look entirely natural, as {{though it is not}} groomed at all. It should never be <b>trimmed,</b> but <b>sheared</b> down at least once a year. SWD puppies are always born with curly hair.The SWD can be seen in a variety of colours. It may be solid black, beige, brown, or white; bicolour where the second colour is white; or particolour [...] Tri-coloured dogs are strictly prohibited by the currently held (worldwide) standards for the breed as are black and tan or brown and tan colour combinations.|$|R
5000|$|Mark Proett and Carroll Gantz {{are listed}} as the inventors on the utility and design patents, respectively, {{assigned}} to Black & Decker for a cordless vacuum cleaner. [...] Mark Proett was an engineer whose utility patent was for B&D's Model 9321 cordless vacuum cleaner, called the Spot Vac, {{a component of the}} Mod 4 series of power tools (shrub <b>trimmer,</b> lantern, grass <b>shear,</b> drill, and Spot Vac), all powered by a single, rechargeable, and interchangeable 'energy pak' handle with batteries.|$|R
50|$|In the {{finishing}} process of manufacturing textiles, after the cloth is woven, {{it goes through}} processes such as washing, fulling, raising the nap and trimming the nap. After the nap is trimmed, the fabric is considered finished. The raising process, which draws out {{the ends of the}} fibres, is done on both woollen and cotton fabric. Flannelette is a cotton fabric that goes through this process. There are ways to 'raise the nap', most of which involve wire brushes such as raising cards. Originally, dried teasel pods were used and were still preferred for use on woollen cloth for a long time. Woollen fabrics, which must be damp when raising the nap, are then dried and stretched before the nap is <b>trimmed</b> or <b>sheared.</b> Cotton cloth goes straight to the shearing process, where the nap gets trimmed to ensure that all the raised fibres are the same length.|$|R
5000|$|In 1897 John K. Stewart and Thomas J. Clark {{incorporated}} their Chicago Flexible Shaft Company, {{which made}} horse <b>trimming</b> and sheep <b>shearing</b> machinery. In 1921 the company produced its first Sunbeam branded household appliance, the Princess Electric Iron (with {{an option to}} buy a fireproof metal storage box). The name [...] "Sunbeam" [...] came from a company wide contest to rebrand its growing home appliance business. Edwin J Gallagher (1897-1983) a buyer and traffic manager for the company won the contest and received a check for $1,000. The company did not officially incorporate its name to Sunbeam until 1946.|$|R
50|$|In the Middle Ages bars {{of metal}} were cast and {{hammered}} {{out on an}} anvil. Portions of the flattened sheets were then cut out with shears, struck between dies and again <b>trimmed</b> with <b>shears.</b> A similar method {{had been used in}} Ancient Egypt during the Ptolemaic Kingdom (c. 300 BC), but had been forgotten. Square pieces of metal were also cut from cast bars, converted into round disks by hammering and then struck between dies. In striking, the lower die was fixed into a block of wood, and the blank piece of metal laid upon it by hand. The upper die was then placed on the blank, and kept in position by means of a holder round which was placed a roll of lead to protect the hand of the operator while heavy blows were struck with a hammer. An early improvement was the introduction of a tool resembling a pair of tongs, the two dies being placed one at the extremity of each leg. This avoided the necessity of readjusting the dies between blows, and ensured greater accuracy in the impression.|$|R
60|$|So Eric {{came forward}} {{up the long}} hall that was adorned with things more splendid than ever his eyes had seen, and stood before the King. With him came Skallagrim, driving the two captive viking chiefs before him with his axe, as a flesher drives lambs. Now, during these many months Brighteyes had grown yet more great in girth and glorious to look on than he was before. Moreover, his hair was now so long that it flowed like a flood of gold down towards his girdle, for since Gudruda <b>trimmed</b> it no <b>shears</b> had come near his head, and his locks grew fast as a woman's. The King {{looked at him and}} was astonished.|$|R
5|$|There {{is also an}} {{indeterminate}} {{relationship between}} the figures in the spandrels and the lunettes beneath them. Because of {{the constraints of the}} triangular shape, in each spandrel the figures are seated on the ground. In six of the eight spandrels the compositions resemble traditional depictions of the Flight into Egypt. Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with <b>shears</b> <b>trimming</b> the neck of a garment she is making while her toddler looks on. The Biblical woman who is recorded as making a new garment for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went to live in the temple, and indeed, the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive hat that might suggest that of a priest. The other figure who differs from the rest is a young woman who sits staring out of the picture with prophetic intensity. Her open eyes have been closed in the restoration.|$|R
6000|$|She {{started to}} her feet and {{followed}} the direction that Susy had taken. For a moment she had to front the afternoon trade wind which chilled her as it swept the plain beyond the gateway, but was stopped by the adobe wall, above whose shelter the stunted treetops--through years of exposure--slanted as if <b>trimmed</b> by gigantic <b>shears.</b> At first, looking down the venerable alley of fantastic, knotted shapes, she saw no trace of Susy. But half way down the gleam of a white skirt against a thicket of dark olives showed her the young girl sitting on a bench in a neglected arbor. In the midst of this formal and faded pageantry she looked charmingly fresh, youthful, and pretty; and yet the unfortunate woman thought that her attitude and expression at that moment suggested more than her fifteen years of girlhood. Her golden hair still hung unfettered over her straight, boy-like back and shoulders; her short skirt still showed her childish feet and ankles; yet there seemed to be some undefined maturity or a vague womanliness about her that stung Mrs. Peyton's heart. The child was growing away from her, too! ...|$|R
40|$|In our prior study, a {{progressive}} forming system to fabricate meso-scaled bulk cylindrical and flanged parts by using sheet metals has been developed. In this forming system, the cylindrical part is formed via blanking, while the flanged part is formed via the progressive punching, extrusion and blanking. In forming of the flanged part, the preform {{is attached to}} the metal strip and positioned based on the geometry of preform. The formed part is finally <b>trimmed</b> out by <b>shearing</b> in the last operation. In such a way, the transporting, positioning and ejecting of preform/part are facilitated. In this paper, the research is aimed at further studying the feasibility of forming microscaled parts by using the previously developed forming system and examining its characteristics based on the material flow behavior, microstructure evolution, the quality and property of the final formed parts. It is revealed that the length of blanked cylinder decreases with the increase of grain size. When the grain size is large compared to the workpiece thickness, an inclined fracture surface is formed on the blanked cylinder and the rollover surface on the flanged part becomes rough. A rough fracture surface with microvoids is formed after shearing operation. The number of microvoids on the fracture surface decreases with the increase of grain size. The developed process is proved to be promising and efficient for mass production of bulk microparts directly using sheet metal. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
