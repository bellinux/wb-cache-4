5|$|<b>The</b> <b>boardwalk</b> was {{constructed}} in 1984 by the City of Salisbury to encourage appreciation of the mangrove's ecological importance. On 29 April 1995, South Australian Premier Dean Brown and federal MP Chris Schacht opened the St Kilda Interpretative Centre {{at the entrance to}} <b>the</b> <b>boardwalk</b> which showcases the flora, fauna and processes within the mangrove forest. Since 1997 the mangrove trail has been privately managed, hosting school visits as well as casual visitors.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>boardwalk</b> {{is within}} the barker inlet aquatic reserve, where the taking of crabs {{shellfish}} and plants is prohibited and pets are not allowed. The mangroves, saltmarsh and adjacent lagoons form a habitat for over 200 bird species with the mangroves {{being part of a}} nursery area for most of the commercial and recreational fish species of Gulf St Vincent. The 2005 Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary Act established a sanctuary for the Bottlenose dolphins that live in the inlet and adjacent Port River. The sanctuary's northern extent is the boat channel and dolphins can sometimes be seen at high tide in the tidal creeks passing under <b>the</b> <b>boardwalk.</b>|$|E

5|$|September 16, 1903– A {{hurricane}} makes landfall on Atlantic City as an 80mph (129km/h) hurricane, {{making it}} the most recent (until 2011) hurricane to directly strike the state. Dubbed by the Atlantic City Press as the Vagabond Hurricane, the storm gathers media interest from Philadelphia and New York, with one newspaper offering $200,000 (1903USD) to aid the survivors. When the reporters arrive at the coast, they are disappointed {{at the lack of}} damage, which is confined to loose boards along <b>the</b> <b>boardwalk.</b> The storm's strong surf destroys several boats along the coastline, including 34 in Waretown.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Danielle dropped light {{rainfall}} {{across much}} of New Jersey, with some areas in the southwestern portion of the state experiencing over 3inches (76mm). Strong waves from the storm washed out miles of beaches along the coastline. In Ocean City, the waves passed over <b>the</b> <b>boardwalk</b> and into houses. Further north, the waves crashed a four-person, 35-foot (10-m) sailboat near Island Beach State Park. Two managed to swim safely to shore, though the other two occupants drowned.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} World War II, Cedar Point {{was in need of}} {{financial}} help. The wood of the Cyclone roller coaster was rotting, <b>the</b> <b>boardwalk</b> was cracked in many places, and the fishing dock was in need of repair. In 1946, Cedar Point's oldest still-existing ride, the Midway Carousel, was installed. By 1951, the Cyclone coaster was razed because of its poor condition, leaving the resort without a roller coaster. As the Cyclone was being removed, the Laff-in-the-Dark, Rocket Ships, and Loop-A-Plane attractions were installed. Cedar Point Causeway was built in 1957, and is still in use. The president of Cedar Point, Bernie Zeiher, was replaced by George Roose around 1958, and Emile Legros was elected chairman that same year.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the National Centre for Popular Music, {{a museum}} {{dedicated}} {{to the subject of}} popular music, was opened in the city.

Live music venues in the city include the Harley Hotel, Leadmill, West Street Live, <b>the</b> <b>Boardwalk,</b> Dove & Rainbow, The Casbah, The Cremorne, Corporation, New Barrack Tavern, The Broadfield Hotel, Redstone bar and nightclub, the City Hall, the University of Sheffield Students' Union, the Studio Theatre at the Crucible Theatre, the O2 Academy Sheffield and The Grapes.|$|E
5|$|The two routes {{continue}} {{to the southeast}} through business areas, meeting CR 575 and a ramp to the Atlantic City Expressway. CR 575 turns east to follow US 40/US 322. The road enters Egg Harbor Township, and CR 575 splits from US 40/US 322 by turning to the south. The route passes more wooded residential and commercial areas, {{as well as the}} Storybook Land amusement park, before intersecting CR 563. US 40/US 322 forms a concurrency with that route and passes through a business district that includes the Harbor Square shopping center. CR 563 splits from the road by continuing southeast and the Black Horse Pike heads east interchange with the Garden State Parkway. The only direct ramp present is between the Black Horse Pike westbound and the Garden State Parkway northbound; all other movements are provided by CR 563. Past here, US 40/US 322 continues east past more businesses, crossing CR 651 before entering Pleasantville. In Pleasantville, the road crosses US 9, where the name changes to Verona Avenue. Upon crossing CR 585, the Black Horse Pike continues past residences as an undivided road, crossing back into Egg Harbor Township. The road passes more businesses, closely paralleling the Atlantic City Expressway before entering Atlantic City. Here, the name becomes Albany Avenue and it comes to a pair of ramps that provide access to and from the Black Horse Pike eastbound and the Atlantic City Expressway westbound. US 40/US 322 enters marshland, crossing the Great Thorofare onto Great Island before passing over the Beach Thorofare. Past this bridge, the road passes between businesses to the west and the closed Bader Field airport and the abandoned Bernie Robbins Stadium to the east. US 40/US 322 crosses the Inside Thorofare on a drawbridge and continues as a county maintained road to its end at Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Avenue, one block from <b>the</b> <b>boardwalk.</b> Through New Jersey, US 40 serves as a main road connecting Atlantic City with points south along Interstate 95, such as Baltimore and Washington, D.C.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, WAYV/WAIV, {{along with}} sister station WZXL, were named {{official}} stations of <b>the</b> Wildwoods <b>boardwalk.</b> Because <b>the</b> WAIV frequency is much stronger near Wildwood {{than in other}} towns in the listening area, the 102.3 frequency was advertised slightly more during this time than it is closer to Atlantic City. This included signs on <b>the</b> <b>boardwalk's</b> famous tram cars advertising both frequencies.|$|R
