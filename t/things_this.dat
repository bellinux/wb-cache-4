5|$|The main {{thrust of}} William Paley's {{argument}} in Natural Theology is that God's {{design of the}} whole creation {{can be seen in}} the general happiness, or well-being, that is evident in the physical and social order of <b>things.</b> <b>This</b> sets the book within the broad tradition of the Enlightenment's natural theology; and this explains why Paley based much of his thought on John Ray (1691), William Derham (1711) and Bernard Nieuwentyt (1750).|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus. In November 2007, Cal Poly became a signatory {{member of the}} American College & University Presidents Climate Commitment. Among other <b>things,</b> <b>this</b> committed the university to ensure that within one year, it would purchase or produce at least 15% of the institution's electric consumption from renewable sources. The university, along with other members in the CSU, {{is also a member}} of the California Climate Action Registry. and lists on The Princeton Review's Guide to 375 Green Colleges.|$|E

25|$|Among other <b>things</b> <b>this</b> {{assumption}} precludes circular indifference curves. Non-satiation in {{this sense}} is not a necessary but a convenient assumption. It avoids unnecessary complications in the mathematical models.|$|E
25|$|During {{his term}} the last link of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad was opened, {{establishing}} {{it as the}} primary transportation route between Baltimore and Philadelphia. Among other <b>things,</b> <b>this</b> route went through Wilmington and by-passed New Castle, further establishing {{the dominance of the}} former city.|$|E
25|$|Both Ray Illingworth and Bill Lawry {{have done}} some mystifying <b>things</b> <b>this</b> series, but the English captain must about win the prize with his {{decision}} not to force Australia to follow on...I know, for sure, that our captain in South Africa, Ali Bacher, would have told Lawry to put the pads on again.|$|E

25|$|Checkpoint {{regulation}} {{plays an}} important role in an organism's development. In sexual reproduction, when egg fertilization occurs, when the sperm binds to the egg, it releases signalling factors that notify the egg that it has been fertilized. Among other <b>things,</b> <b>this</b> induces the now fertilized oocyte to return from its previously dormant, G0, state back into the cell cycle and on to mitotic replication and division.|$|E
25|$|In late 1941 {{and early}} 1942, {{he came into}} contact with the {{resistance}} circle about Carl Friedrich Goerdeler. Bolz readily declared {{that he would like to}} take over a ministerial post in the new government after Hitler was overthrown. Goerdeler put him down as Culture Minister in the cabinet that he foresaw having to put together. Among other <b>things,</b> <b>this</b> would have meant that Bolz would be taking Goebbels's place.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, Norway {{experienced}} an increasing and more political nationalism. Among other <b>things,</b> <b>this</b> {{led to the}} creation of the national socialist party National Unification in 1933. Inspired by medieval aristocracy and Viking society and ideals, the National Unification established the paramilitary organisation The Hird. Established to protect the party and its leader, Vidkun Quisling, it had obvious parallels to the medieval aristocratic class hird, who were lifeguards of the King.|$|E

25|$|Tarkovsky {{became a}} film {{director}} during the mid and late 1950s, a period {{referred to as}} the Khrushchev Thaw, during which Soviet society opened to foreign films, literature and music, among other <b>things.</b> <b>This</b> allowed Tarkovsky to see films of European, American and Japanese directors, an experience which influenced his own film making. His teacher and mentor at the film school, Mikhail Romm, allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence of the film director.|$|E
25|$|Philo's {{notion is}} even more {{abstract}} {{than that of the}} Monad of Pythagoras or the Good of Plato. Only God’s existence is certain, no appropriate predicates can be conceived. Following Plato, Philo equates matter to nothingness and sees its effect in fallacy, discord, damage, and decay of <b>things.</b> <b>This</b> view enables Philo to combine the Jewish belief in creation with the Greek conviction about the formation of all things from the permanent matter.|$|E
25|$|Deceleration {{of a free}} charged particle, such as an electron, {{can produce}} visible radiation: {{cyclotron}} radiation, synchrotron radiation, and bremsstrahlung radiation are all examples of this. Particles moving through a medium faster {{than the speed of}} light in that medium can produce visible Cherenkov radiation. Certain chemicals produce visible radiation by chemoluminescence. In living <b>things,</b> <b>this</b> process is called bioluminescence. For example, fireflies produce light by this means, and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake.|$|E

25|$|In algebra and in {{particular}} in algebraic combinatorics, the ring of symmetric functions is a specific limit of the rings of symmetric polynomials in n indeterminates, as n goes to infinity. This ring serves as universal structure in which relations between symmetric polynomials can be expressed in a way independent of the number n of indeterminates (but its elements are neither polynomials nor functions). Among other <b>things,</b> <b>this</b> ring {{plays an important role}} in the representation theory of the symmetric group.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1956, Pontiac {{introduced}} a higher-powered {{version of its}} V8. Among other <b>things,</b> <b>this</b> version of the engine was equipped with a high-performance racing camshaft and dual 4-barrel carburetors. This {{was the first in}} a series of NASCAR-ready pre- Super-Duty V8 engines and introduced the long line of multi-carburetor equipped engines that saw Pontiac become a major player during the muscle car and pony car era of the 1960s. Interestingly, the enlarged 1956 Pontiac V8 found its way into light-duty GMC pickup trucks.|$|E
25|$|Amongst other <b>things</b> <b>this</b> {{recommended}} a curator be appointed for the Commission’s holdings (John M. Scholes), retention of the York museum, creation of other regional museums (not {{carried out in}} the way proposed), a small relics display in the old Great Hall at Euston railway station (done on a temporary basis) and a large museum of collections elsewhere in London. For the latter, the former station at Nine Elms was originally favoured as a site, but what was eventually opened in 1961 was the Museum of British Transport in a former bus garage in Clapham.|$|E

25|$|Realistically, {{the set of}} ravens is finite. The set of non-black {{things is}} either {{infinite}} or beyond human enumeration. In order to confirm the statement 'All ravens are black', {{it would be necessary}} to observe all ravens. This is difficult but possible. In order to confirm the statement 'All non-black things are non-ravens', it would be necessary to examine all non-black <b>things.</b> <b>This</b> is not possible. Observing a black raven could be considered a finite amount of confirmatory evidence, but observing a non-black non-raven would be an infinitesimal amount of evidence.|$|E
25|$|In July, 2011, GoDaddy {{introduced}} {{a policy of}} blocking DNS queries from some outside DNS servers, {{in order to prevent}} other DNS queries from being too slow. Among other <b>things,</b> <b>this</b> prevents some bots from visiting websites, forcing some search engines to exclude domains hosted with GoDaddy. This policy affects search engine ranking for various GoDaddy customers who have multiple domains with different registrars. GoDaddy has refused to comment on the policy or the perception that their servers cannot handle the load or they are giving preference to their platinum level customers. It has also interfered with projects that collect Internet statistics.|$|E
25|$|A celebration to God’s {{glory and}} to the dignity of man. All that’s left most artists seem to feel these days, is man. Naked, poor, forked radish. There aren’t any celebrations. Ours, the {{scientists}} keep telling us, is a universe, which is disposable. You know it might be just this one anonymous glory of all <b>things,</b> <b>this</b> rich stone forest, this epic chant, this gaiety, this grand choiring shout of affirmation, which we choose when all our cities are dust, to stand intact, to mark where we have been, to testify to what we had it in us, to accomplish.|$|E
