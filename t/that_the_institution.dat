5|$|After resigning {{from the}} AHC, Darwaza {{spent the rest}} of his life in the modern state of Syria where he left {{politics}} to concentrate on literature. Although he did much of his writing in the 1930s and 1940s, he did not have any of his works published until the 1960s. As a pan-Arab intellectual, Darwaza aided in establishing the union between Syria and Egypt forming the short-lived United Arab Republic. After Egypt adopted its 1956 constitution declaring that it was an Arab country and its people a part of the Arab nation, Darwaza concluded that Egypt and Syria were in a position to unite. When unity negotiations underwent, he suggested several forms of federation, such as the American, Soviet, and Indian models, but did not recommend any specific model for an Arab state. Darwaza did, however, suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> of a federation between Egypt and Syria would be the first step towards the realization of a comprehensive union.|$|E

50|$|Toward {{the middle}} of the 1970s and {{throughout}} the 1980s, Marxist theorists began to develop structuralist Marxist accounts of the state, law, and crime. Structuralist Marxism disputes <b>the</b> instrumentalist view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state can be viewed as the direct servant of the capitalist or ruling class. Whereas the instrumentalist position argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> of <b>the</b> state are under the direct control of those members of the capitalist class in positions of state power, the structuralist perspective takes <b>the</b> position <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> of <b>the</b> state must function {{in such a way as}} to ensure ongoing viability of capitalism more generally. Another way that Marxists put this is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> of <b>the</b> state must function so as to reproduce capitalist society as a whole. The Miliband-Poulantzas debate between instrumentalist Ralph Miliband and structuralist Nicos Poulantzas characterized the debate between structural and instrumental Marxists.|$|R

5|$|Kriegseisen notes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> of the sejmik {{gained a}} {{negative}} reputation following the partitions of Poland, {{and it has}} been described as one of the dysfunctional elements of the Polish political system that contributed to the fall of the Commonwealth. He cautions against such simplistic assessments, and traces them to 18th century publications whose negative views of the sejmiks have been rarely challenged since. The stereotype of a group of drunken, fighting nobility, found in some literature, should not be seen as representative, particularly outside the period of the sejmik's decline in the 18th century. He argues that while many sensationalist descriptions of debauchery, brawling or outright bloody violence at sejmiks have survived, they did so because they were just that—sensationalist—and should be seen as exceptions to the long, uneventful, but usually constructive proceedings that were much more common.|$|E
5|$|On April 22, 1844, Secretary Calhoun {{signed the}} treaty of {{annexation}} and ten days later delivered it to the Senate for consideration in secret session. The details of the treaty negotiations and supporting documents were leaked by Senator Benjamin Tappan of Ohio to the press. Tappan, a Democrat, was an opponent of annexation and of slavery. The terms of the Tyler-Texas treaty {{and the release of}} Calhoun's letter to British ambassador Richard Pakenham exposed the annexation campaign as a program to expand and preserve slavery. In the Pakenham letter, Calhoun alleged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> of slavery contributed to the physical and mental well-being of Southern slaves. The U.S. Senate was compelled to open its debates on ratification to public scrutiny, and hopes for its passage by the two-thirds majority required by the Constitution were abandoned by administration supporters. In linking Texas annexation to the expansion of slavery, Calhoun had alienated many who might previously have supported the treaty.|$|E
