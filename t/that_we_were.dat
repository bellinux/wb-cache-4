5|$|In 2011, at age 12, he {{impressed}} former football manager Lars Tjærnås {{during a}} nationwide tournament for under-16s: The best 15-year-olds {{in the country}} were gathered for a tournament between the top clubs... It was definitely {{not the first time}} he had astonished his opponents or the spectators. He was three or four years younger than the others. It was impossible not to realize <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> witnessing something out of the ordinary.|$|E
5|$|The general {{opinion was}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{going to remain}} in the ghetto {{until the end of the}} war, until the arrival of the Red Army. Then {{everything}} would be as before. It was neither German nor Jew who ruled the ghetto– it was illusion.|$|E
5|$|In {{completely}} arbitrary fashion Collet {{chose the}} names of six composers, Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and myself, {{for no other reason}} than that we knew each other, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> friends and were represented in the same programmes, but without the slightest concern for our different attitudes and our different natures. Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of Cocteau, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art... Collet's article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six had come into being.|$|E
30|$|The {{location}} of the asylum center helps to establish an image of refugees as being criminal and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> scary. This image is taken over by some parts of society. Danes thus get the picture <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> too many and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> causing problems (Refugees in Denmark, 2016).|$|R
50|$|Our {{community}} {{is built on}} trust. At Waring, we students, teachers, parents and administrators {{have a responsibility to}} make our school a creative, productive environment for social and intellectual growth. We shape and maintain our culture, and it requires <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have integrity, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> honest, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> caring and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> courageous.|$|R
50|$|Steven Pinker notes <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{not born}} with language, {{so that it}} <b>is</b> not likely <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{engineered}} to think in words alone.|$|R
5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} {{because what we}} were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason why}} the older {{generation}} feel so strongly about English grammar is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> severely punished if we didn't obey the rules! One split infinitive, one whack; two split infinitives, two whacks; and so on.|$|E
60|$|Now {{here comes}} in the whole {{collapse}} and huge blunder of our age. We have mixed up two different things, two opposite things. Progress should mean <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> always changing the world to suit the vision. Progress does mean (just now) <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> always changing the vision. It should mean <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> slow but sure in bringing justice and mercy among men: it does mean <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> very swift in doubting the desirability of justice and mercy: a wild page from any Prussian sophist makes men doubt it. Progress should mean <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> always walking towards the New Jerusalem. It does mean that the New Jerusalem is always walking away from us. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> not altering the real to suit the ideal. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> altering the ideal: it is easier.|$|R
60|$|We see {{by these}} {{examples}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not to consult our own interest and ambition, but <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{to consider the}} interests of others {{as well as our}} own.|$|R

She says her films are for the next generation: [...] "Because <b>we</b> have {{children}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> bearing, and because there are people already here now who exist (my daughter exists now), <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> telling stories to: <b>we</b> need to <b>be</b> very clear about the messages we’re putting out." ...|$|R

25|$|What {{he has got}} to {{understand}} is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> speaking the truth for 23 years and apologies have only started to come today from them because of yesterday. It's too little, too late. It's fine to apologise afterwards. They just don't want their names in any more sleaze. No, his apology doesn't mean a thing to me.|$|E
25|$|We’re {{so lucky}} to have gotten here, and if we {{look back on the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> on Capitol Records at a certain point, being {{distributed}} and making these albums under budget… there was one year when we were the only band on the label to profit, when MC Hammer lost a shitload of money. I can still appreciate how odd it was that we had the chance to do that because it doesn’t really happen in a lot of cases.|$|E
6000|$|... "Comrade Gregory {{has told}} us, in only too apologetic a tone, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not {{the enemies of}} society. But I say <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> the enemies of society, and so much the worse for society. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> the enemies of society, for society is the enemy of humanity, its oldest and its most pitiless enemy (hear, hear). Comrade Gregory has told us (apologetically again) <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not murderers. There I agree. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> not murderers, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> executioners (cheers)." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> hopelessly behindhand in {{aeronautics}} {{is not a}} fact by itself. It {{is merely}} an indication <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> behindhand in our mechanical knowledge and invention M. Blériot's aeroplane points also to the fleet.|$|R
6000|$|... {{which is}} {{beyond the reach of}} Carroll. The poet seems so easy on the matter <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> almost driven to pretend <b>that</b> <b>we</b> see his meaning, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> know the {{peculiar}} difficulties of a Pobble, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> as old travellers in the 'Gromboolian Plain' as he is.|$|R
25|$|Until then, all {{results from}} the solar radio-spectrographs had been {{inferred}} from studying the Sun by looking at its spectrum with only very limited angular resolution. Wild wanted to actually see what these phenomena looked like on the Sun, actually get a moving picture of them. The frequency range <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> interested in was around about the metre wavelengths. To get the resolution roughly equivalent {{to that of the}} human eye at these long wavelengths required an aperture some three kilometres in diameter. So I devised a method of synthesising a three kilometre aperture with 96 antennas in a ring.|$|E
25|$|The column’s factual {{accuracy}} {{has been}} called into question. Novak stated in his autobiography, “We were so ravenous for exclusive news <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> susceptible to manipulation by leaks, compromising our credibility.” Chicago Sun-Times became the “home” paper for Inside Report from 1966 onward. Novak continued the column after Evans’s departure on May 15, 1993. Evans died in 2001, and Inside Report ran in over 150 papers at that time through Creators Syndicate. Publication ended after Novak’s cancer diagnosis in July 2008. Bloomberg L.P. has stated that the column was a must-read among political insiders, as did The Washingtonian. It was the longest running syndicated political column in U.S. history.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of the non-Euclidean geometries had a ripple effect which went far {{beyond the boundaries of}} mathematics and science. The philosopher Immanuel Kant's treatment of human knowledge had a special role for geometry. It was his prime example of synthetic a priori knowledge; not derived from the senses nor deduced through logic— our knowledge of space was a truth <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> born with. Unfortunately for Kant, his concept of this unalterably true geometry was Euclidean. Theology was also affected by the change from absolute truth to relative truth in the way that mathematics is related to the world around it, that was a result of this paradigm shift.|$|E
5000|$|State {{officials}} {{must know}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> serious about stopping abortion,... First, {{we must make}} definite <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in no way talking about any kind of theocracy. Let me say that with great emphasis. Witherspoon, Jefferson, the American Founders {{had no idea of}} a theocracy. That is made plain by the First Amendment, and we must continually emphasize the fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not talking about some kind, or any kind, of a theocracy.|$|R

25|$|His various {{publications}} include {{literature on}} the Neanderthals and Modern Humans {{as well as on}} ornithology and his research programme includes ongoing excavations at Gorham's Cave, the last known site of the Neanderthals, as part of the Gibraltar Caves Project. Finlayson's 2009 book on Neanderthals and their interaction with Homo sapiens expands on the idea <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> the same species since modern man contains genetic sequences that are shared with neanderthals and the possibility of interbreeding is likely. However, Finlayson discusses that because these shared genetic sequences are common across the globe then it is possible that these shared genes are due to our common heritage in Africa.|$|E
25|$|Into the '60s, I {{was still}} not of a frame of mind <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not only making music, we were making history. But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going {{all over the world}} at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E
25|$|With the Salon d'Automne of {{that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants. I {{remember}} this Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for our heads. And what had we hung? Metzinger his lovely canvas entitled Le Goûter; Léger his sombre Nus dans un Paysage; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself La Chasse and the Portrait de Jacques Nayral. How distant it all seems now! But I can still see the crowd gathering together in the doors of the room, pushing at those who were already pressed into it, wanting to get in to see for themselves the monsters <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were.</b>|$|E
50|$|He taught Kriya Yoga {{and other}} {{meditation}} practices {{to help people}} achieve that understanding, which he called Self-realization:Self-realization is the knowing - in body, mind, and soul - <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> one with the omnipresence of God; <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{do not have to}} pray that it come to us, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not merely near it at all times, but that Gods omnipresence is our omnipresence; and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> just {{as much a part of}} Him now as <b>we</b> ever will <b>be.</b> All <b>we</b> have to do is improve our knowing.|$|R

25|$|Mr. Trowbridge {{returned}} from the school {{to say that the}} only hope for safety to any Americans seemed to be to return to the school, staying there alone, separated from the Armenians. He declared <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> powerless to save the Armenians. It seems that after we left the school, Miss Wallace, Mr. Chambers, and a young Armenian preacher attempted to cross the street from Miss Wallace's to the school. Just at this time a mob rushed around the corner. The infuriated Turks recognized the preacher as an Armenian, and although Mr. Chambers threw his arms about him and did all in his power to save the man's life, they shot him dead. Not a single Armenian would they leave alive, the assassins shouted, as Mr. Chambers dragged the murdered preacher into the building.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Jack Roush, {{owner of}} Roush Racing, offered Kvapil {{a seat in}} the No. 6 Ford F-150 in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. Kvapil {{replaced}} Mark Martin in the truck, who moved to Ginn Racing, and David Ragan, who was promoted to replace Martin in the No. 6 Ford in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Jack Roush, excited about signing with Kvapil, said, “We are pleased beyond measure <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able to get a driver the caliber of Travis Kvapil. At only 30 years old with a Truck championship and two years of Sprint Cup experience under his belt, Travis brings great long and short term potential to and for Roush Racing.” He finished the season with four wins, three poles, eight Top 5's and 12 Top 10's. He finished the season sixth in the driver point standings. He returned to Roush Fenway Racing as a part-time driver in 2008 when Joey Clanton was released from the No. 09 Ford.|$|E
25|$|At Cabinet on {{the morning}} of 30 October Lloyd {{reported}} that the USA was ready to move a motion at the UN condemning Israel, which had attacked Egypt in the Sinai the previous day, as an aggressor. Macleod and Heathcoat Amory approved of Lloyd's suggestion of postponing the attack by 24 hours (in breach, as it happens, of the secret agreement between Britain, France and Israel) in order to bring the Americans on board, although they thought it unlikely to work, but it was not adopted. Macleod was telling others of his dismay that ministers had not been fully informed of the agreement with France and Israel. Either now or at some subsequent meeting Eden apologised to the Cabinet for his reticence “in time of war”, causing Macleod to snap “I was not aware <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> at war, Prime Minister!” The Anglo-French ultimatum was on the afternoon of 30 October.|$|E
