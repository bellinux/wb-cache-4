2500|$|AuCoin {{was also}} criticized {{for working with}} Senator Hatfield, Washington Representative Norman D. Dicks, and House Speaker Tom Foley for legislating a special timber sales program in 1990. The legislation, {{referred}} to disparagingly by some environmentalists as [...] "The Rider from Hell," [...] {{was in response to}} an injunction by federal judge William Lee Dwyer that shut down all logging in federal forests in the Pacific Northwest after the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management failed to develop management plans for the threatened northern spotted owl. Responding to the imminent collapse of jobs in timber and related industries, the amendment legislated a harvest, but also gave old-growth forests statutory status for the first time, directed that fragmentation of them be minimized, and banned logging of them in designated spotted owl habitat areas identified in the environmental impact statement., effectively overruling Judge Dwyer's order. While AuCoin and the other sponsors stated an intention for the law to be temporary while plans to protect forests and threatened species such as <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> were put in place, it authorized a two-year harvest of more than 5 billion board feet in Oregon and Washington and became a precedent for future industry-supported environmental waivers long after AuCoin left Congress. In his last years in Congress, AuCoin worked to lower the regional harvest to 1.1 bbf in 1991, 0.8 bbf in 1992, and 0.6 bbf in 1993.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> (Strix occidentalis) is {{a species}} of true owl. It is a {{resident}} species of old-growth forests in western North America, where it nests in tree holes, old bird of prey nests, or rock crevices. Nests can be between 12 and 60 m high and usually contain two eggs (though some contain as many as four). It is a nocturnal owl, which feeds on small mammals and birds. Three subspecies are recognized, ranging in distribution from British Columbia to Mexico. <b>The</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> is under pressure from habitat destruction throughout its range, and is currently classified as a near-threatened species.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> has {{an average}} length of 43 cm, {{wingspan}} of 114 cm, and weight of 600 g. Its eggs are a little over 50 mm long, and are white and smooth with a slightly grainy texture. <b>The</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> is similar in appearance to the barred owl, but has cross-shaped markings on the underparts, whereas the barred owl is alternately barred on the breast and streaked on the belly. Barred owls are larger and grayer than spotted owls. In recent years, the California and northern subspecies of spotted owl have been displaced by barred owls, which are more aggressive, have a broader diet, and occur in more varied habitats. Though the two species may hybridize in areas where displacement is occurring, they are genetically quite distinct.|$|E

5000|$|Barred owls {{are partly}} {{responsible}} for the recent decline of <b>the</b> northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owl,</b> native to British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. The 2011 Revised Recovery Plan for <b>the</b> Northern <b>Spotted</b> <b>Owl</b> (p. vi) states “Based on the best available scientific information, competition from the barred owl (S. varia) poses a significant and complex threat to <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> owl.” Since <b>the</b> 1960s, barred owls have been expanding their range westward from the eastern US and Canada (see “Distribution and habitat” section above). When <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> and barred owls share the same area, the barred owls generally are more aggressive and out-compete <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>owls,</b> leading to decreased populations of the native owls. Barred owls may even kill <b>spotted</b> <b>owls.</b> Barred <b>owls</b> and <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> occasionally interbreed, creating hybrids ("sparred owl" [...] or [...] "botted owl"). Only 47 hybrids with barred owls were found in an analysis of more than 9000 banded spotted owls; consequently, hybridization between these two species is considered by the authors of that analysis to be “an interesting biological phenomenon that is probably inconsequential compared with the real threat—direct competition between the two species for food and space” (p. 808).|$|R
