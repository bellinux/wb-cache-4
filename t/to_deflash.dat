50|$|Cryogenic {{deburring}} is a {{cryogenic process}} used to remove burrs and flash from plastic and die cast workpieces. The process works by tumbling and/or abrasively blasting the workpieces at cryogenic temperature levels. The low temperatures (approximately -195 C) are achieved using liquid nitrogen, liquid carbon dioxide, or dry ice. This low temperature brings the material below its embrittlement temperature, which causes the flash or burrs {{to be easily}} removed via tumbling or media blasting. This process {{has been around since}} the 1960s <b>to</b> <b>deflash</b> plastic and rubber. Common materials that are typically cryogenically deburred with blast media include PEEK, nylon, Teflon, Delrin, polypropylene, polycarbonate, acetal, PTFE, PET, HDPE, PVC, ABS and many others.|$|E
