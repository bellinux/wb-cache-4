50|$|The {{entrapment}} <b>by</b> <b>estoppel</b> defence {{exists in}} both federal and city jurisdictions; however, case law remains inconsistent {{as to whether}} the misleading advice of e.g. a state official provides protection against federal criminal charges. Examples exist of an appellate court failing to allow an entrapment <b>by</b> <b>estoppel</b> defence where a municipal official provided misleading instructions regarding a state law.|$|R
50|$|In many states, <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the {{entireties}} {{is recognized}} as a valid form of ownership for bank accounts and financial assets. One must be careful {{to ensure that the}} <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entireties designation is chosen as opposed to other forms of joint ownership such as joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, so that the benefits of <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entireties status is not lost. For example, under Florida law, if a bank account titling document allows for <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entireties and joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, if the account is opened as a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship account, the benefits of <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> entireties will not attach.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the {{entirety}} (sometimes called a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entireties) {{is a type}} of concurrent estate formerly available only to married couples, where ownership of property is treated as though the couple were a single legal person. (In the State of Hawaii, the option of Tenants by the Entirety ownership is also available to domestic partners in a registered [...] "Reciprocal Beneficiary Relationship"; Vermont's Civil Union statute qualifies parties to a civil union for <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> {{the entirety}}.) Like a Joint Tenancy with Rights of Survivorship, the <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entirety also encompasses a right of survivorship, so if one spouse dies, the entire interest in the property is said to [...] "ripen" [...] in the survivor so that sole control of the property ripens, or passes in the ordinary sense, to the surviving spouse without going through probate.|$|R

25|$|When a {{property}} owner misrepresents {{the existence of}} an easement while selling {{a property}} and does not include in the deed to the buyer an express easement over an adjoining property that the seller owns, a court may step in and create an easement.

If the court finds that the buyer acted reasonably and in good faith and relied on the seller's promises, the court may create an easement <b>by</b> <b>estoppel.</b>|$|R

(2) Does it extend that exemption to the rents and profits arising from <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entirety property? (3) Will the provisions for management of entirety property by husband and wife generate a theory of <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> acquiescence? (4) Will the courts utilize the curative principles of the reform act when holding that pre-reform law was unconstitutional because of gender discrimination? (5) Does the act intend to change ownership of rents and profits accruing after the act 2 ̆ 7 s effective date, January 1, 1983, from entirety property where the cotenancy was created before that date? (6) Does the act intend to shift management and control of pre-enactment entirety property? (7) Does the act enable thirdparty donors creating a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entirety to validly claim two federal gift tax annual exclusions on the theory that the wife 2 ̆ 7 s interest is no longer a future interest? and (8) Does the act cause a shift in the bases of the husband and wife in entirety property that will affect federal income tax liabilities...|$|R
5000|$|In some jurisdictions, {{to create}} a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the {{entirety}} the parties must specify in the deed that the property is being conveyed to the couple [...] "as tenants by the entirety," [...] while in others, a conveyance to a married couple is presumed {{to create a}} <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entirety unless the deed specifies otherwise. (see also Sociedad de gananciales) Also, besides sharing the four unities necessary to create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship time, title, interest, and possession there must also be the fifth unity of marriage. However, unlike a JTWROS, neither party in a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entirety has a unilateral right to sever the tenancy. The termination of the tenancy or any dealing with {{any part of the}} property requires the consent of both spouses. A divorce breaks the unity of marriage, leaving the default tenancy, which may be a tenancy in common in equal shares. Many US jurisdictions no longer recognize <b>tenancies</b> <b>by</b> the entirety. [...] Where it is recognized, benefits can include the ability to shield the property from creditors of only one spouse, as well as the ability to partially shield the property where only one spouse is filing a petition for bankruptcy relief. If a non-debtor spouse in a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entirety survives a debtor spouse, the lien can never be enforced against the property. On the other hand, if a debtor spouse survives a non-debtor spouse, the lien may be enforced against the whole property, not merely the debtor spouse's original half-interest.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the Entirety (United States): [...] "TBE" [...] is a {{separate}} property system in which spouses are treated as one person, each having an equal ownership {{interest in the subject}} property. In some U.S. states, <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entirety is limited to realty (e.g. the couple take title to the family home as tenants by the entirety) while other states make it available for both realty and personalty (e.g. the couple can also take title to the family automobile as tenants by the entirety).|$|R
2500|$|<b>Estoppel</b> <b>by</b> {{convention}} as {{understood in}} English law (also known as <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> agreement) occurs where two parties negotiates or operates a contract {{based on a}} shared assumption or mutual understanding of a legal effect (or interpretation) of that contract, they are bound by that belief, assumption or understanding if (i) they both knew the other operated under the same, and (ii) they both regulated their subsequent dealings on the same. [...] It {{has been said that}} <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> convention is not truly an estoppel but merely an instance of <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> representation, promissory <b>estoppel</b> or proprietary estoppel, though the first of the three is its most frequent manifestation.|$|R
