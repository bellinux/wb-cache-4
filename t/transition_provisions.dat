Since 1980, the number of active participants in Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insured single employer DB plans has dropped from 27. 3 percent of all national private wage and salary workers in 1980, to about 15 percent in 2002, and more recently the PBGC has assumed {{billions of dollars in}} unfunded benefit obligations from bankrupt plan sponsors. Some analysts have identified hybrid DB plans like cash balance (CB) plans as a possible means to revitalize this declining system. However, conversions from traditional DB plans to CB plans have sometimes been controversial because of the effect conversions may have on the benefits of workers of different ages.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the timing and the {{determinants}} of electing Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 159 in the banking industry. Design/methodology/approach – The authors hypothesize certain factors that will potentially affect banks' election decisions and separate banks into three groups: early electors, late electors and non-electors by hand-collecting the election decisions and the timing of the election decisions. Univariate and logit rank regressions are used to identify the determining factors between electors (vs non-electors) and between early electors (vs late electors). Findings – The authors find that compared to banks not electing SFAS No. 159 (non-electors), banks electing SFAS No. 159 (early electors as well as late electors) face greater earnings pressures, have less volatile earnings and larger size, and are active in hedging activities. In addition, compared to banks electing SFAS No. 159 at required election date (late electors), banks electing SFAS No. 159 early (early electors) have weak financial strength, less volatile earnings, and are more likely to be audited by non-Big- 4 auditors. Research limitations/implications – The study only focuses on the banking industry, so the results from may not be generalized to other industries. Future studies could explore how SFAS No. 159 impacts firms in different industries. Originality/value – The authors' overall results suggest that the banks might have many considerations in mind when they elect to use SFAS No. 159. The results provide useful information for regulatory bodies to evaluate the efficacy of issuing the standard. Early electors could have exploited the opportunities provided by the <b>transition</b> <b>provisions</b> of this standard to boost their regulatory capital ratios.

In the short term, energy efficiency provides large potential for mitigation – and energy savings at the same time.

Symptom control (Domain 5) was defined, for simplicity, as documented evidence of pharmacological and non-pharmacological control of symptoms such as pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and anxiety. Assessments were made prior and after intervention to determine if patients’ had achieved adequate symptom control. Domains 6 and 7 were excluded as they relate to organisational processes that could not be determined through patient records review. Palliative or non-curative treatment intent was defined as patients with no further active treatment options available, but those that could be on phase 1 trials or be receiving treatment to control or maintain disease stability but without curative intent.

Scientific research can offer substantial support to decision making by providing evidence {{of the interaction between}} land management and land function services. The goal of this paper was to identify the most important land use functions and services from a local perspective and to compare these functions and services with the land-related research topics addressed in the scientific literature. For this purpose, we conducted a workshop with local stakeholders (land use decision makers) in the West Ujimqin Banner (Inner Mongolia) as a specific case study and performed a comprehensive survey of the Inner Mongolian land use research published in international scientific journals. Our analysis indicated that the stakeholders assigned particular importance to social land use functions, such as jobs, as well as environmental land use functions and ecosystem processes.

Transition towards servitization requires many changes within the company and cooperation with partners. These changes concern {{every part of the}} processes in the company and create many challenges in the areas of touch points. In a short span of investigation, it was identified by researchers and scholars that broad areas of challenges usually appear during the transition process. By the review and analysis of studies of various academics in the literature, there were identified and distinguished the changes different companies have been through in their transformation path towards servitization and challenges associated due to these changes. In order to answer research questions there was used a secondary data - two case companies from the research articles were selected for investigation.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{describe}} the design, imple-mentation and evaluation of Proteus, a power-proportional cache cluster which eliminates the delay penalty during server provisioning dynamics. To speed up data center services, a cache cluster is used {{in front of the}} database tier, providing fast in-cache data access. Since the number of cache servers is large, building power-proportional cache clusters can lead to con-siderable monetary savings. Dynamic server provisioning, one common methodology for realizing power proportionality in data centers, calls for agile load balancing schemes and smart in-cache data migration algorithms when applied to cache clusters. Otherwise, it induces unacceptable delay spikes due to data re-allocation among cache servers. Proteus addresses both challenges by using a specifically designed virtual nodes placement algorithm and an amortized data migration policy. We implement Proteus, and evaluate it on a 40 -server cluster using real Wikipedia data and workload traces. The results show that, with Proteus, the load distribution is much more evenly balanced compared to the case of applying unmodified consistent hashing. At the same time, Proteus induces almost no extra delay during <b>provisioning</b> <b>transitions,</b> which is a significant advantage over other state-of-the-art solutions...|$|R

In this paper, we examine the ways in which the ‘smart city’ is being put to work for different ends and through different means. We argue that the co-constitution of the urban as a site for carbon governance and a place where smart energy systems are developed is leading to novel forms of governmental intervention operating at the conjunction of the grid and the city. We seek to move beyond examining the rationales and discourses of such interventions to engage with the ways in which they are actualised in and through particular urban conditions in order to draw attention to their material politics. In so doing, we argue that the urban is not a mere backdrop to <b>transitions</b> in electricity <b>provision</b> and use but central to its politics, while electricity is also critical to the ways in which we should understand the politics of urbanism...|$|R
40|$|Background: British {{government}} policy advocates {{the availability of}} single-sex inpatient mental health services (Department of Health, 2003), but there is relatively little literature comparing single-sex and mixed-sex service provision and less still describing transitions between the two. Aims: To describe the experience of nursing staff on an acute psychiatric ward during the transition from mixed-sex to all-male provision and the following 9 months and to suggest how {{this might have been}} improved. Method: All nursing staff working on the ward {{at the time of the}} change were asked to complete questionnaires 3 and 9 months later. Results: Response rates were 75 % and 50 % at 3 and 9 months respectively. Staff generally experienced the change negatively, with particular concerns about the ward environment becoming less therapeutic and more aggressive, and jobs becoming more stressful. These concerns did not diminish over time. Other concerns were related to the process and administrative consequences of change. Conclusions: The <b>transition</b> to single-sex <b>provision</b> can be a difficult one, and staff should be involved as fully as possible in the process of change.
