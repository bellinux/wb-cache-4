2500|$|Because New Criticism {{isolated}} {{the text and}} excluded historical and <b>biographical</b> <b>contexts,</b> critics argued as early as 1942 that Brooks' approach to criticism was flawed for being overly narrow and for [...] "disabl any and all attempts to relate literary study to political, social, and cultural issues and debates" [...] (1350). His reputation suffered in the 1970s and 1980s when criticism of New Criticism increased. Brooks rebuffed the accusations that New Criticism has an [...] "antihistorical thrust" [...] (Leitch 2001) and a [...] "neglect of context" [...] (Leitch 2001). He insisted he was not excluding context because a poem possesses organic unity, {{and it is possible}} to derive a historical and <b>biographical</b> <b>context</b> from the language the poet uses (Singh 1991). He argues [...] "A poem by Donne or Marvell does not depend for its success on outside knowledge that we bring to it; it is richly ambiguous yet harmoniously orchestrated, coherent in its own special aesthetic terms" [...] (Leitch 2001).|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} postcolonial in approach, and {{comparative}} in method. It examines {{a number of}} texts by Joseph Conrad and Alun Lewis, authors who, because of their origins;respectively, Polish and Welshh;were ambivalently associated with the dominant discourse of imperialism. Their occupations; Conrad was a merchant seaman, Lewis an Army officer; implicated them in regimes that regarded them as 'Other'. Their narratives represent insider-outsider positions that are pertinent to the periods of imperial uncertainty {{in which they were}} written: in Conrad's case, at the fin-de-siecle, and in Lewis's, in the 1930 s and 1940 s. The principal stories examined are Conrad's Heart of Darkness, and Lewis's 'The Orange Grove', both of which have biographical bases. Following a Review of the Critical Field, Chapter 1, 'Biography and Culture', discusses the displacements of the authors' upbringings and subsequent careers, including Conrad's employment with an imperial trading company in the Congo, and Lewis's position as a soldier in war-time India, showing how <b>this</b> <b>biographical</b> and colonial <b>context</b> informs the authors' works. Chapter 2 begins the comparative analyses, including consideration of texts by other writers. It concerns the potentially 'enslaving' effect of pedagogical discourses of Anglicization. Texts by the Welsh-bom explorer, Henry M. Stanley, and the Jewish-Welsh writer, Lily Tobias are compared to Conrad's novella, The Nigger of the "Narcissus",and two stories by Lewis. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on texts that deconstruct the fixities of imperial and gender identity by means of performative narratives. Through comparisons with stories by Rudyard Kipling, it is demonstrated that Heart of Darkness and Lewis's 'Indian' texts increasingly represent complex 'double narratives' of empire. These chapters address issues of hybridization, irresolvable identity, and migratory 'statelessness', concluding that the writings of Conrad and Lewis illuminate conflictual, modern ideas of identity...|$|R

This article undertakes a close reading of the two poems written during this period, placing them within both the narrow, <b>biographical</b> <b>context</b> and the broader, poetological context of Rilke’s creative crisis. In particular, the marked increase in dialogic intensity over the two poems – indicated by the transition from ‘Sie’ to ‘du’ – suggests a rare moment of renunciation of Orphic narcissism in favour of a genuine emotional vulnerability...|$|R
