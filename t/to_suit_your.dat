500|$|The Fourth Test at Manchester proved controversial. The Old Trafford pitch {{had little}} grass, {{perhaps as a}} result of earlier wet weather. [...] Again, Johnson lost the toss and England chose to bat first. Johnson and his {{spinning}} partner, Richie Benaud were unable to exploit the spin-friendly conditions and the English made 459runs. [...] In reply, the Australians could not {{come to grips with the}} conditions; Laker took nine of the ten wickets, Lock the other, as Australia were brushed away for just 84. Amid wild weather, the Australians were asked to follow-on. [...] A determined batting performance was not enough to prevent an English victory by an innings and 170runs. [...] Laker's performance was historic. [...] He took 10/53, the first time in a Test match a bowler had taken all ten wickets in an innings. [...] With his 9/37 in the first innings, he had captured 19wickets for the match, still a world record in first-class cricket. [...] Wisden reported that the Australians were [...] "extremely bitter over the condition of the pitch". Former Test cricketer and journalist Bill O'Reilly wrote [...] "This pitch is a complete disgrace" [...] while Colin McDonald later said, [...] "England cheated: if by cheating you include the practise of preparing wickets <b>to</b> <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> own purpose." [...] Johnson was generous towards the victors. Playing down the discontent felt by the Australians, he said: [...] "When the controversy and side issues of the match are forgotten, Laker's wonderful bowling will remain." [...] The media reported that Australia had been [...] "Lakered".|$|E

6000|$|Fanny, who {{had heard}} it all, and borne Edmund company in every feeling {{throughout}} the whole, now ventured to say, in her anxiety to suggest some comfort, [...] "Perhaps {{they may not be}} able to find any play <b>to</b> <b>suit</b> them. <b>Your</b> brother's taste and your sisters' seem very different." ...|$|R

2500|$|Laker {{dismissed}} Miller for six, {{his only}} scoring shot being a strike over the fence. Australia fell from 0/48 {{to be all}} out for 84, with Laker taking 9/37. Australia were forced to follow on and Miller was tormented for 15 minutes before being bowled for a duck by Laker, who took an unprecedented 10/53 at Test level to take a world record 19wickets as Australia lost by an innings and 170 runs. Australia's misery was compounded by regular rain interruptions during their innings, which turned the pitch into a sticky wicket. Wisden reported that the Australians were said [...] "to be extremely bitter over {{the condition of the}} pitch". Former Test cricketer and journalist Bill O'Reilly wrote [...] "This pitch is a complete disgrace" [...] while opening batsman Colin McDonald later said, [...] "England cheated: if by cheating you include the practise of preparing wickets <b>to</b> <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> own purpose." [...] During the Tests at Headingley and Old Trafford, Laker and Lock bowled two thirds of the overs and took 38 of the 40 Australian wickets.|$|E
