40|$|Water-related disease {{remains one}} of the major health {{concerns}} in the World. Diarrhoeal diseases, which are largely derived from poor water <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> account for 2. 4 million deaths each year and contribute over 73 million Disability Adjusted Life Years per annum (WHO, 1999). On a global scale, this places diarrhoeal disease sixth highest cause of mortality and third in the list of morbidity and it is estimated that 5. 7 per cent of the global disease burden is derived from poor water, <b>sanitation</b> <b>and</b> hygiene (Prüss et al., 2002). This health burden is primarily borne by the populations in developing countries and by children. At 2002 estimates, one-sixth of humanity (1. 1 billion people) lack access to any form of improved water supply within 1 kilometre of their home and one-fifth of humanity (2. 6 billion people) lack access to some form of improved excreta disposal (WHO and UNICEF, 2004). These figures relate to the clear definitions provided in the updated Global Water Supply <b>and</b> <b>Sanitation</b> Assessment Report <b>and</b> are shown in Table 1. 1 below. Table 1. 1.
