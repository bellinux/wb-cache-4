5|$|The {{most common}} uses for enzyme inhibitors are as drugs to <b>treat</b> <b>disease.</b> Many of these inhibitors target a human enzyme and aim {{to correct a}} {{pathological}} condition. However, not all drugs are enzyme inhibitors. Some, such as anti-epileptic drugs, alter enzyme activity by causing more or less of the enzyme to be produced. These effects are called enzyme induction and inhibition and are alterations in gene expression, which is unrelated {{to the type of}} enzyme inhibition discussed here. Other drugs interact with cellular targets that are not enzymes, such as ion channels or membrane receptors.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{researchers}} and scientists, 74% of the world's poultry meat, and 68 percent of eggs are produced {{in ways that are}} described as 'intensive'. One alternative to intensive poultry farming is free-range farming using lower stocking densities.

While this prophylactic method of preventing disease is profitable because it prevents loss and allows fish to grow more quickly, there are several downsides.|$|R

McDowell, where he learned contemporary techniques of fire cupping and leeching, then considered the primary techniques to <b>treat</b> <b>disease.</b> He continued to study medicine under the mentorship of Dr. McDowell and other abolitionist doctors, such as Dr. F.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, when {{scientists}} were just discovering the potential uses of radiation to <b>treat</b> <b>disease,</b> little {{was known about}} safe dosage levels and precise methods of delivery. At that time, radiation was used to treat a variety of noncancerous medical problems, including enlargement of the tonsils, adenoids, and thymus gland. Later, researchers found that high doses of radiation caused soft-tissue sarcomas in some patients. Because of this risk, radiation treatment for cancer is now planned {{to ensure that the}} maximum dosage of radiation is delivered to diseased tissue while surrounding healthy tissue is protected as much as possible.|$|E

25|$|Medical imaging is the {{technique}} and {{process of creating}} visual representations of {{the interior of a}} body for clinical analysis and medical intervention, as well as visual representation of the function of some organs or tissues (physiology). Medical imaging seeks to reveal internal structures hidden by the skin and bones, as well as to diagnose and <b>treat</b> <b>disease.</b> Medical imaging also establishes a database of normal anatomy and physiology to make it possible to identify abnormalities. Although imaging of removed organs and tissues can be performed for medical reasons, such procedures are usually considered part of pathology instead of medical imaging.|$|E
25|$|Radiation therapy uses special {{equipment}} to send {{high doses of}} radiation to the cancer cells. Most cells in the body grow and divide to form new cells. But cancer cells grow and divide faster {{than many of the}} normal cells around them. Radiation works by making small breaks in the DNA inside cell. Radiation might not be a choice of treatment if the tumour was diagnosed on the late stage or is located on vulnerable places. Moreover, radiation causes significant side effects if used in children aged 0–14. It was determined to be a beneficial treatment but it causes significant side effects that influence the lifestyle of the young patients. Radiotherapy is the use of high-energy rays, usually x-rays and similar rays (such as electrons) to <b>treat</b> <b>disease.</b> It works by destroying cancer cells in the area that's treated. Although normal cells can also be damaged by radiotherapy, they can usually repair themselves, but cancer cells can't. If the tumour was found on the late stage, it requires patient`s higher radiation explosion and might be harmful for the organs.Radiotherapy is determined to be an effective treatment in adults but it causes significant side effects that can influence patients` daily living. In children radiotherapy mostly causes long-term side effects such as hearing loss and blindness. Children who had received cranial radiotherapy are deemed at a high risk for academic failure and cognitive delay.|$|E
