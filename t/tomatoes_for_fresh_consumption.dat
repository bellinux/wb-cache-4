40|$|Tomato, a {{basic product}} in Spanish horticulture, {{occupies}} 14 % of the horticultural surface cultivated {{and contributes to}} 23 % {{of the value of}} the sector's production. Spanish tomatoes satisfy the interior demand and have a strong export demand. About 25 % of the fresh production and 50 % of the canned fruit are exported. Crop management systems for tomato production in Spain require, as the principal alternatives to methyl bromide (MB), hybrid varieties with resistance to pathogens and soil fumigation with other conventional fumigants. New "long life " varieties that possess the Mi gene have overcome the problem of susceptibility to the nematode genus Meloidogyne. The "Mediterranean system " for producing <b>tomatoes</b> <b>for</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>consumption</b> is much more effective in controlling diseases and yields better quality fruit than the "Dutch system " which is based primarily on cultivation using substrates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{selection}} of hybrids with good yield potential has great importance in greenhouse tomatoes culture {{in order to}} improve the economic efficiency of this crop. Consumer interest in the quality of vegetable products also increased in the last years. In this experiment six <b>tomato</b> hybrids <b>for</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>consumption</b> recommended <b>for</b> greenhouse culture were evaluated as yield potential and quality of fruits. The evaluation of tomato fruits quality included appearance, firmness and chemical composition. The highest early and total yields were obtained in Menhir F 1, Shanon F 1 and Monroe F 1 and the best fruit quality in Monroe F 1, Tolstoi F 1 and Cronos F 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAgricultural studies {{focusing}} on the development and/or improvement of new varieties {{of fruits and vegetables}} usually prioritize the productivity, disease resistance, response to fertilization, and higher nutrient content. However, new product development needs to take into account not only flavour preference, but also consumer preference for appearance since without tasting products, consumers have to make decisions based on the way a product looks. The present study evaluated the sensory characteristics and consumer preference of ten promising accessions of organic cherry <b>tomato</b> <b>for</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>consumption</b> aiming at identifying the sensory attributes related to appearance that contributed to consumer liking/disliking the fruit. More specifically, the objective {{of the study was to}} guide producers regarding the target appearance attributes that play a role on consumer acceptance of cherry tomatoes. Ten accessions of organic cherry tomatoes were evaluated by a trained panel using the QDA methodology, and also by 80 <b>tomato</b> consumers <b>for</b> the acceptance of appearance and intention to purchase. The results achieved after integrating these two data sets (from the trained panel and consumers) in a multidimensional map allowed the elucidation of consumer liking of tomatoes in relation to the appearance, i. e. drivers of liking/disliking were identified. Results revealed that tomatoes with round shape and red colour (reddish) (cultivar ENAS 1031, ENAS 1010, ‘Perinha Agua Branca’, Super Sweet, and ‘Joana’) were the most liked cherry tomatoes. Those genotypes were also liked by the smallest segment (17. 5 % of participants) but for them unusual shapes (oblong and pear), orange-yellow colour, and bigger size were also liked. Despite the small number of participants in this study (80 consumers), new shapes and colours for the organic cherry tomatoes could be considered promising alternatives in the Brazilian market, and can be an opportunity for the producers of the state of Rio de Janeiro...|$|R
40|$|Nine <b>tomato</b> cultivars <b>for</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>consumption</b> and {{processing}} were evaluated for fruit quality at the Fruit Research Station Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The {{height of the}} fruits was between 46. 7 mm (Red River) and 59. 8 mm (Chico Grande), {{the diameter of the}} fruits oscillated between 48. 0 mm (Event) and 72. 4 mm (Natalia) and the form of the fruits was different from one variety to another: spherical for Indiana, high spherical for Chico Grande, Event, Jet, Montego and Line Cluj 8 - 2002, flattened spherical for Perla Clujului, Natalia and Red River. All the cultivars had fruits with firm flesh; the best firmness was represented by Chico Grande, Event and Line Cluj 8 - 2002, all these having been prescript as potential genitors for creation of the new varieties with a good firmness of the fruits. It was identified a strong correlation between the shape index and the firmness of the fruits (r = 0. 784), which demonstrated that the high-spherical fruits had a more firm flesh than the flattened ones. The dry matter content of the fruits oscillated between 5. 26 % for Indiana and 8. 25 % for Natalia, these two varieties also providing the extreme limits for the sugar content: 4. 58 % (Indiana) and 6. 25 % (Natalia). The Mature Fruit Yield (MFY) was correlated in a strong and positive way to the dry matter content of the fruits and with their vitamin C content. Between the Total Fruit Yield (TFY) and the dry matter content of the fruits there was a positive correlation (r = 0. 843). The weight of the fruits was significantly correlated to all the chemical traits of the fruits (the content of dry matter, ascorbic acid, sugar and titrable acids). The varieties obtained at Cluj-Napoca, Natalia and Perla Clujului, with fruits rich in sugar and in vitamin C were recommended as genitors in tomato breeding in order to create new cultivars with fruits proper for processing on a high level...|$|R

The microbiological or chemical contamination risk results were calculated for the land preparation and planting process, cultural management of the crop, human factor performing the cultural management of the crop, phytosanitary control, harvesting, packaging, and the human factor involved in packaging. The risk analysis results indicate that the human factor participating in the packaging obtains the highest risk rating, followed by the cultural management of the crop and, in third place, by the harvesting process.
