The model <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> shaft <b>of</b> caster {{vibration}} device is built by finite element software ANSYS, and bearings {{are regarded as}} rigid constraints and elastic constraints. Firstly, regarding the bearings as rigid constraints, the nodes on the parts <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> shaft, which match with bearing,are exerted full constraints. Secondly, regarding bearings as elastic constraints, spring, which is built by elastic element combination 14, are used to replace the bearings. In addition, the full constraints are exerted {{on the one side}} of spring,and axial constraint are exerted on the other side. Afterwards make the modal analysis <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> shaft. Solve and extract the first six natural frequency and modal shape. Watch and analyse the breaking formal <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> shaft as it is in different mode. The basis are settled for instantaneous and harmonic analysis...|$|R

40|$|Performance of {{a series}} <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> contractions {{produces}} adverse effects including muscle weakness, delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), fluid accumulation and decreased muscle function. The repeated bout effect is a physiological adaptation observed when a single-bout <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> exercise protects against muscle damage from subsequent eccentric bouts. Similar to the repeated bout effect, increases in flexibility {{have been linked to}} attenuations in acute muscle damage, muscle fatigue and strength loss after eccentric exercise. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the muscle physiological responses to eccentric strength training after first priming the muscles with either a period of static flexibility training or a single intense bout <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> exercise performed weeks earlier; and compare these to the responses from eccentric strength training when no prior intervention is administered. Methods: Twenty-five participants were randomly assigned to a flexibility (F) (n= 8), a single-bout (SB) (n= 9), or a control (C) (n= 8) group. The design consisted of two 4 -week phases; 1) priming intervention, 2) eccentric training. The priming intervention included static stretching (3 x/week; 30 mins/day) (F), a single-bout <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> exercise (SB) or no priming intervention (C). All groups proceeded to complete <b>eccentric</b> training <b>of</b> the knee flexors using isotonic contractions (%load progressively increased over training period) on a dynamometer following the priming intervention phase. Testing was completed at baseline, post-priming intervention and post-eccentric training, in conjunction with data being collected during the acute eccentric training phase (0 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr; post-bout 1 and 4). Dependent measures included muscle thickness, isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), eccentric and concentric MVC, optimal angle, active range of motion (ROM), passive ROM, maximal power, electromyography (EMG) and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Results: Acute data during the eccentric training phase revealed a significant reduction in DOMS for both the F and SB groups compared to the C following the first bout <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> exercise (p< 0. 05). The F also had reduced soreness in comparison to both the SB and C post fourth bout <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> exercise (p< 0. 05). The F group demonstrated attenuated loss in isometric strength (post fourth bout) and maximal power (post first bout) during eccentric training compared to the C group (p< 0. 05). However, there was no significant difference between groups across all dependent variables following the eccentric training phase. Conclusion: This is the first study to directly compare the protective effects observed with static flexibility training to that of a single-bout <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> exercise throughout a subsequent eccentric training regime. Although differences in muscle soreness, strength and maximal power occurred during the acute stages <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> training, there appeared to be no significant advantage of either protective priming method at the end <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> training...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} muscle adaptations to altered task mechanics during cycling, this study investigated the impact of altered seat height and cadence on timing and duration of gastrocnemius (GAST), biceps femoris (BF) and vastus lateralis (VL) eccentric contractions and muscle activation patterns, and cycling economy. Ten male cyclists completed 9 × 5 min of cycling at 3 seat heights and 3 cadences. Three-dimensional leg kinematics and muscle activation patterns were recorded to estimate timing <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> muscle contractions. Onset, offset and duration <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> contractions and, onset, offset and duration of muscle activation were calculated, along with cycling economy. Duration of GAST and VL eccentric contractions decreased with increasing seat height due to earlier offset <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> muscle contractions. Duration <b>of</b> BF <b>eccentric</b> contractions significantly increased with seat height due to a later eccentric contraction offset. Offset of GAST and BF muscle activation occurred earlier with increasing cadence. Cycling economy was significantly affected by cadence but not seat height. The results suggest that {{as a consequence of}} altered seat height, proprioceptive feedback is used to fine-tune the timing <b>of</b> bi-articular <b>eccentric</b> muscle contractions. These results may have implications for seat height self-selection...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{coronary}} stenoses may be {{the cause}} of a variable angina threshold and rest angina in patients with chronic stable angina. It has been suggested that eccentric but not concentric coronary artery stenoses have the potential for dynamic changes of caliber in response to vasoactive stimuli. The vasomotor response <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> (asymmetric narrowing) and concentric (symmetric narrowing) coronary stenoses to ergonovine (20 µg intracoronary or 300 µg intravenous) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg intracoronary) was studied in 51 patients with chronic stable angina. Diameter of reference segments (angiographically normal segments proximal to the stenoses) and that <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> (n = 30) and concentric (n = 35) coronary stenoses that ranged from 50 % to 90 % luminal diameter reduction were measured by computerized quantitative angiography before and after ergonovine and isosorbide dinitrate. Ergonovine reduced stenosis diameter (by ≥ 10 %) in 80 % <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> stenoses and 42 % of concentric stenoses (p < 0. 05). Mean (± SEM) diameter reduction with ergonovine was 19 ± 3 % and 9. 5 ± 2 % for eccentric and concentric stenoses, respectively (p < 0. 05). Isosorbide dinitrate increased coronary diameter (by ≥ 10 %) in 70 % <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> and 43 % of concentric stenoses (p < 0. 05). Mean diameter <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> stenoses increased from 1. 15 ± 0. 05 to 1. 35 ± 0. 06 mm after nitrate (18. 6 ± 2. 5 %), whereas diameter of concentric stenoses increased from 1. 05 ± 0. 05 to 1. 14 ± 0. 05 mm (10 ± 2. 5 %) (p < 0. 05). Average dilation of reference segments with administration of isosorbide dinitrate and constriction with ergonovine were not significantly different in patients with concentric and eccentric stenoses. Thus, in patients with chronic stable angina, both eccentric and concentric stenoses have the potential for dynamic changes of caliber in response to vasoactive stimuli. However, a significantly larger proportion <b>of</b> <b>eccentric</b> stenoses exhibit this potential. The magnitude of dynamic changes of caliber is also larger in eccentric than in concentric stenoses...|$|R
