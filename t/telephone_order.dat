40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} a systematic {{effort to reduce}} <b>telephone</b> <b>orders</b> for prescription medications in a community family practice. DESIGN: Three-year intervention project. SETTING: Solo family practice in Ottawa. PARTICIPANTS: All patients requesting <b>telephone</b> <b>orders</b> for prescription medications. INTERVENTIONS: A retrospective analysis of phone requests and orders was conducted on 1 continuous year's records. A new office policy was instituted on October 9, 1992, discouraging <b>telephone</b> <b>orders</b> for prescription medication. Prescription <b>telephone</b> requests and <b>orders</b> were then monitored continuously for the next 3 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of telephone prescription requests and orders per half-day 1 year before the intervention compared with the number for the 3 years after the intervention. RESULTS: One year before the intervention, there were 4. 96 telephone prescription requests per half-day: 3 years after the intervention this number fell to 0. 85. One year before the intervention, the number of <b>telephone</b> prescription <b>orders</b> per half-day was 4. 80; this number fell continuously to 0. 67 during the 3 years following the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: We observed {{a reduction in the}} number of telephone prescription requests and orders following the introduction of an office policy that encouraged prescribing and renewing medication in person...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} effects of entry {{regulation}} and deregulation on taxicab availability and service quality based on the experiences of 43 cities and counties in the United States and Canada. The analysis shows that entry controls have quite different impacts in the two basic markets served by taxicabs: the <b>telephone</b> <b>order</b> (dispatch) market and the cab stand/street hail market. Without entry controls, the cab stand and street hail market experiences an oversupply of cabs, leading to deterioration of vehicle and driver quality. Applied to the dispatch market, however, entry restrictions often lead to deficiencies in taxicab availability. The paper reviews the effectiveness of regulatory approaches for each market and for cities with substantial trip volumes in both markets. Approaches include two-tier systems, flexible forms of entry control, company-level entry qualifications, geographic restrictions and service requirements. These approaches and implications for regulation are discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of Static Data Authentication (SDA) compliant EMV cards with their improved cardholder verification and card authentication capabilities {{has resulted in}} a dramatic reduction in the levels of fraud seen at Point of Sale (POS) terminals. However, with this POS-based reduction has come a corresponding increase in the level of fraud associated with Internet-based Card Not Present (CNP) transactions. This increase is largely attributable to the fact that Internet-based CNP processing has no easy way of integrating EMV into its transaction architecture. In this regard, payment is reliant on Mail Order <b>Telephone</b> <b>Order</b> (MOTO) based processing where knowledge of card account details is deemed a sufficient form of transaction authorisation. This report aims to demonstrate how Trusted Computing technology can be used to emulate EMV for use in Internet-based CNP transactions. Through a combination of a Trusted Platform Module, processor (with chipset extensions) and OS support we show how we can replicate the functionality of standard EMV-compliant cards. The usage of Trusted Computing in this setting allows a direct migration to more powerful Combined DDA and application cryptogram generation (CDA) cards as well as offering increased security benefits over those seen in EMV's deployment for POS transactions. Customer to Merchant interaction in our setting mirrors transaction processing at traditional POS terminals. We build upon the services offered by Trusted Computing in order to provide a secure and extensible architecture for Internet-based CNP transactions...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{epidemiology}} {{and management of}} skin infections in nursing homes has not been adequately described. We reviewed the characteristics, {{diagnosis and treatment of}} skin infections among residents of nursing homes to identify opportunities to improve antibiotic use. Methods: A retrospective study involving 12 nursing homes in the Denver metropolitan area. For residents at participating nursing homes diagnosed with a skin infection between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2014, clinical and demographic information was collected through manual chart review. Results: Of 100 cases included in the study, the most common infections were non-purulent cellulitis (n= 55), wound infection (n= 27), infected ulcer (n= 8), and cutaneous abscess (n= 7). In 26 cases, previously published minimum clinical criteria for initiating antibiotics (Loeb criteria) were not met. Most antibiotics (n= 52) were initiated as a <b>telephone</b> <b>order</b> following a call from a nurse, and 41 patients were not evaluated by a provider within 48 hours after initiation of antibiotics. Nearly all patients (n= 95) were treated with oral antibiotics alone. The median treatment duration was 7 days (interquartile range [IQR] 7 - 10); 43 patients received treatment courses of â‰¥ 10 days. Conclusions: Most newly diagnosed skin infections in nursing homes were non-purulent infections treated with oral antibiotics. Antibiotics were initiated by telephone in over half of cases, and lack of a clinical evaluation within 48 hours after starting antibiotics was common. Improved diagnosis through more timely clinical evaluations and decreasing length of therapy are important opportunities for antibiotic stewardship in nursing homes...|$|E

The obstacle of waste was found at distribution process. To reduce waste, lean concept need to be used. The purpose {{of this research is}} to determine waste that commonly happen, conclude cause of it and give some improvement idea to the company. First step is about illustrating by using big picture mapping. To determine waste, the methods that used for collecting data are brain storming and questionnaire to the company owner. Then, doing mapping in detail to determine tools by using Value Stream Analysis Tools (VALSAT. After that, to determine cause of waste by using Why-why method, and will be continue by giving some ideas about reducing waste use 5 W- 1 H concept. From mapping result and collecting data that had been done, we found waste that commonly happened; waste waiting in value 0, 26 and waste conveyance in value 0, 25. Based on previous waste, the result of VALSAT, tools that will be using is process activity mapping for waste waiting and conveyance. For waste waiting found that always happen when waiting in printing process facture. Here, sales persons have to wait for taking order process manually by driving around shop one by one at leas 8 hours. While in waste conveyance the problem is lateness on goods shipping because the company needs more transportation or armada to do it and goods demolition process in modern shop take more time. On the other hand, supply chain response matrix is also used for waste waiting. Hereafter, result of Why-why concept, for waste waiting, taking order in modern way and effective is not available yet. Waste conveyance that commonly happened is because company has less transportation that used for goods shipping and sometimes delays. Then, from 5 W- 1 H concept, the writer gives some ideas for reducing waste by applying how to take order use internet order system and <b>telephone</b> <b>order</b> system and giving some exceptional transportation to serve the modern outlet...|$|E
