40|$|Diploma thesis "Institutional {{solution}} of <b>the</b> problem of <b>unwanted</b> children in Czech Republic" deals, {{as the name}} implies, with solving <b>the</b> problem of <b>unwanted</b> children. An "unwanted child" is a child that is undesired and unwanted within its family. A child can be "unwanted" since its conception, birth, or became unwanted later, during its life. Why is <b>the</b> child <b>unwanted?</b> There is no simple answer to this question, because it depends on each particular case. The reasons can be economical, social, biological, family and other. This diploma thesis discusses <b>the</b> questions of <b>unwanted</b> children from legal point of view - how to adjust legal, and thus also social, position of unwanted children. First chapters are focused on child itself, {{in the past and}} present, on setting of children rights in important documents, for example Declaration of Basic Rights of Czech Republic or Treaty of Children Rights. These chapters also explain <b>the</b> terms <b>Unwanted</b> child, CAN Syndrome, Family and related problems, for example mental defects and family defects. The following chapters describe individual solutions of unwanted children problems. Chapter 3 deals with abortions, contains statistical data, history of legal regulations, current legal regulations, of either legal or illegal abortions, which are criminal. The crime [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Any {{mechanical}} component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness.

Capacitors may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass {{in comparison to the}} compliance of the piece.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar {{made possible by the}} cavity magnetron. In working on the Microwave Early Warning system (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear dipole array antenna that not only suppressed <b>the</b> <b>unwanted</b> side lobes of the radiation field, but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make much difference.|$|E

5|$|Prior to broadcast, series creator Shonda Rhimes did {{not release}} much {{information}} about the season premiere.

After it was announced that Dane would be departing shortly after the commencement of the ninth season, Dempsey uploaded a set picture on Twitter of Sloan in bad condition. Due to <b>the</b> <b>unwanted</b> release of spoilers, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) requested that he delete the photo, and it was subsequently removed. The cast and crew of Grey's Anatomy were being particularly quiet about the fate of Capshaw's character. This secrecy was compromised when McKidd posted a picture on his Twitter account of the editing room, in which there was a picture of Robbins alive on the screen. The picture has since been taken down.|$|E
5|$|With the {{departure}} of Smith and Brinker, Pillsbury allowed many of their changes to be relaxed, as well as scaled back on construction of new locations which {{had the effect of}} stalling corporate growth. By failing to follow through on the changes of the two men, Pillsbury caused its own value to diminish as it derived more than one third of its sales and two thirds of its profits from the burger chain. When the British alcoholic beverages company Grand Metropolitan PLC made a hostile bid for Pillsbury, the company devised a plan to spin off the financially flailing restaurant unit in hopes to raise an estimated US$2billion {{that could be used to}} fend off <b>the</b> <b>unwanted</b> suitor. The complex potentially tax-free stock split plan would have led to the chain, along with its distribution system Distron, becoming a separate entity for the first time in over twenty years.|$|E

5|$|After some deliberation, with {{opinions}} {{sought and}} obtained from Percival Keith, Norris Bradbury, Darol Froman, Elmer E. Kirkpatrick, Kenneth Nichols and Edward Teller, {{it was decided}} that this could be done safely if appropriate precautions were taken. On 28 November 1946, the K-25 plant began producing 94 percent product. At this point, they ran into a serious flaw in the gaseous diffusion concept: enrichment in uranium-235 also enriched the product in <b>the</b> <b>unwanted</b> and fairly useless uranium-234, making it difficult to raise the enrichment to 95 percent. On 6 December 1946, production was dropped back to a steady 2.56kg per day enriched to 93.7 percent uranium-235, along with 1.9 percent uranium-234. This was regarded as satisfactory product by the Los Alamos Laboratory, so on 26 December 1946 enrichment activity at Y-12 was curtailed. The Manhattan Project ended a few days later. Responsibility for the K-25 facility then passed to the new Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947.|$|E
5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by <b>the</b> <b>unwanted</b> sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E
5|$|Kit changes {{had been}} {{introduced}} in the late 1930s. The 1937 season saw Palace field a shirt of claret and blue stripes, before adopting white shirts and black shorts for the following eleven seasons. The club reverted to claret and blue in 1948, but any attempt at changing the kit to change their luck backfired as the club had their worst season to date, finishing bottom and celebrating twenty-five years in League Football by applying for re-election for the first time. Palace kept their place, changed the kit back to white shirts and black shorts, and finished seventh the following season. They followed this up with another bottom place and re-election in 1951, with <b>the</b> <b>unwanted</b> record of scoring the lowest number of goals in a Division Three South season. Palace would remain in {{the bottom half of}} the table until the League was restructured in 1958, requiring re-election a third and final time in 1956, with only Swindon keeping them from bottom spot that season.|$|E

5|$|Palace {{turned to}} former Manchester United captain Steve Bruce as their {{manager for the}} 2001–02 season. A good start gave the club hope for a {{promotion}} challenge, but Bruce then tried to walk out on the club after only four months in charge after being approached by Birmingham City to become their new manager. Palace put Bruce on gardening leave while they searched for a new manager. The club eventually allowed Bruce to join Birmingham, and he was replaced by Trevor Francis, ironically his predecessor at the Midlands club Under Francis, Palace finished mid-table for two successive seasons, and Francis left {{to be replaced by}} long-serving coach Steve Kember. Kember guided Palace to victories in their opening three games of the 2003–04 Division One campaign, which put Palace {{at the top of the}} table, but he was sacked in November after a terrible loss of form saw them slip towards the bottom three. Caretaker player-manager Kit Symons, was put in charge of first-team duties for a month and oversaw an improvement in form before the appointment of Iain Dowie as manager was made. Dowie, a former Palace player, transformed the club from relegation candidates at Christmas into play-off contenders in April, where they overcame West Ham United in the Play-off Final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on Saturday 29 May 2004. A goal from captain Neil Shipperley was enough for them to win the match 1–0, and with it a return to the Premiership. Palace once again could not maintain their seat at the top table, however, and again dropped down a division in spite of the 21 Premiership goals struck by Andrew Johnson, the second highest goalscorer in the division. Palace now held <b>the</b> <b>unwanted</b> distinction of being the only team to have been relegated from the Premier League four times.|$|E
