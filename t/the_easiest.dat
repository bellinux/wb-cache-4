40|$|Objectives: In May 2008, the National Health Service (NHS) Lanarkshire (NHSL) {{implemented}} a unique telephone-based sickness absence management service entitled “EASY” (Early Access to Support for You). <b>The</b> <b>EASY</b> service supplements existing absence policies and enables telephone {{communication between the}} absentee, their line manager, and <b>the</b> <b>EASY</b> service from <b>the</b> first day of absence and referral to occupational health services at day ten. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if <b>the</b> <b>EASY</b> service was effective between May 2008 and May 2012 in reducing sickness absence in NHSL compared to normal occupational healthcare in NHS Scotland and is, as such, a cost-saving intervention. Methods: This study included time-series analysis of health board sickness absence data and analyses of <b>the</b> <b>EASY</b> service database (survival analyses and Cox’s proportional hazards model).
