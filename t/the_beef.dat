5|$|Beef steak is graded for quality, {{with higher}} prices for higher quality. Generally, the higher the quality, the more tender <b>the</b> <b>beef,</b> the less time is needed for cooking, or the better the flavor. For example, beef fillet is the most tender and wagyu, such as Kobe beef from Japan, {{is known for its}} high quality and {{commands}} a high price. Steak can be cooked relatively quickly compared to other cuts of meat, particularly when cooked at very high temperatures, such as by broiling or grilling.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s {{the breed}} enjoyed much success because <b>the</b> <b>beef</b> market demanded low input (feed) cattle with high quality meat. However, the BSE crisis (commonly {{referred}} to as mad cow disease) caused an export ban in 1990, although there were no cases of BSE found in Galloway cattle. This created a fear associated with cattle, so breed numbers declined.|$|E
5|$|It is {{now found}} {{in many parts of}} the world, being {{exported}} to Canada in 1853, the US in 1882 and Australia in 1951. The breed enjoyed success during the 1950s but this subsided during the foot and mouth crisis. Today, the breed is enjoying a revival, due to the demands of <b>the</b> <b>beef</b> market. The breed is considered average size and they have a thick coat, due to the climate of their native Scotland.|$|E

5|$|The Chicken Big King {{was added}} April 2014. This new {{variation}} on the original Big King sandwich {{was part of a}} corporate menu restructuring that began the previous year. This was part of Burger King CEO Alex Macedo's plan to introduce simpler products that require few or no new ingredients in order to simplify operations. This new sandwich uses the company's existing Crispy Chicken Jr patty in place of <b>the</b> <b>beef</b> and adds an extra layer of King sauce to ensure that the product stays moist.|$|E
5|$|The meat of Highland cattle {{tends to}} be leaner than most beef because Highlands are largely {{insulated}} by their thick, shaggy hair rather than by subcutaneous fat. Highland cattle can produce beef at a reasonable profit from land that would otherwise normally be unsuitable for agriculture. The most profitable way to produce Highland beef is on poor pasture in their native land, the Highlands of Scotland. The meat is also gaining popularity in North America as <b>the</b> <b>beef</b> is low in cholesterol.|$|E
5|$|As a {{response}} to recent obesity trends in the United States and other nations, Burger King modified its menu and food preparation practices. In addition to offering lower-fat menu item such as salads, the company has updated its nutrition guides to include dietary guidelines and other nutritional data. One of its reactions to the concerns over trans-fats was to initiate a program in January 2008 to phase out added trans-fat in its products, and to switch to pure vegetable oils that are free of hydrogenated fats. The program ended in early 2009 with a complete changeover to the new oils. Most, but not all, of the products contain no added trans-fats; some products, such as <b>the</b> <b>beef</b> used in the hamburgers, still contain naturally occurring trans-fats.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> process changes <b>beef</b> by two means. Firstly, {{moisture}} is evaporated {{from the}} muscle. The resulting process of desiccation creates a greater concentration of beef flavour and taste. Secondly, <b>the</b> <b>beef's</b> natural enzymes {{break down the}} connective tissue in the muscle, which leads to more tender beef.|$|R
5|$|In 2000, an {{estimated}} 45million people were infected with <b>the</b> <b>beef</b> tapeworm Taenia saginata and 3million with the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. Infection of the digestive system by adult tapeworms causes abdominal symptoms that are unpleasant but not disabling or life-threatening. However, neurocysticercosis resulting from penetration of T. solium larvae {{into the central}} nervous system is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. In 2000, about 39 million people were infected with trematodes (flukes) that naturally parasitize fish and crustaceans, but can pass to humans who eat raw or lightly cooked seafood. Infection of humans by the broad fish tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum occasionally causes vitamin B12 deficiency and, in severe cases, megaloblastic anemia.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} cattle {{slaughtered}} by <b>the</b> <b>beef</b> industry increased by 134%, from 71,000 head in 1937 to 160,000 head in 1945. Vegetable dehydration, {{one of the}} Food Production Committee's main initiatives, proved a great success, allowing Rhodesia to export many products to the UK that would previously have spoiled in transit. Southern Rhodesia also provided goods to the Eastern Group Supply Council, a body set up in 1940 to co-ordinate the build-up of war materiel in India and other British colonies and dominions east of Suez, {{with the goal of}} reducing the amount of supplies shipped from the UK. A Rhodesian officer, Brigadier EG Cook, was the group's deputy controller general. Between 1941 and 1945 Southern Rhodesia contributed large quantities of timber, leather goods, soap and building materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovered}} beef {{material is}} extruded through long tubes that are thinner than a pencil, {{during which time}} at <b>the</b> <b>Beef</b> Products, Inc. (BPI) processing plant, the meat is exposed to gaseous ammonia. At Cargill Meat Solutions, citric acid is used to kill bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. Gaseous ammonia {{in contact with the}} water in the meat produces ammonium hydroxide. The ammonia sharply increases the pH and damages microscopic organisms, the freezing causes ice crystals to form and puncture the organisms' weakened cell walls, and the mechanical stress destroys the organisms altogether. The product is finely ground, compressed into pellets or blocks, flash frozen and then shipped for use as an additive.|$|E

5|$|McLamore and Edgerton {{acquired}} {{a license to}} operate an Insta-Burger King franchise and opened their first location on 4 December 1954 at 3090 NW 36th Street in Miami. By 1959, the pair had stores at several locations within the Miami-Dade area, and operations were growing at a fast rate. However, the partners discovered that the insta-broiler units' heating elements were prone to degradation from the drippings of <b>the</b> <b>beef</b> patties. The pair eventually created a mechanized gas grill that avoided the problems by cooking the meat patties a different way inside the unit. The new cooking appliance, which they called a flame broiler, moved the patties over the flame vertically on a chain link conveyor over the heating elements, a design that imparted grill lines on the patties similar to those made on a charcoal grill. The new unit worked so well that they {{made the decision to}} replace all of their Insta-Broilers with the newly designed unit.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{location}} of Aransas bay, shipping {{has always been a}} major industry. Following the Civil War, the meatpacking industry became a major source of income for ports on the bay, especially Rockport and Fulton, where numerous slaughterhouses were constructed. In the early years of meatpacking, cattle were slaughtered strictly for their hide since {{there was no way to}} refrigerate the meat. As a result, most of the left over cow parts not used as pig feed, were disposed in the bay. This changed in 1871, when an ice machine was installed in a packing plant. By this time, the meatpacking industry near Aransas Bay reached its prime. Prior to the decline of the industry in the area, in 1880, 93% of <b>the</b> <b>beef</b> from Texas slaughterhouses were processed in Rockport-Fulton. Along with fishing, oyster farming and most notably shrimping became major industries on the bay in the early 20th century. Shipbuilding also developed and reached its prime following the first World War. During World War II, the United States Navy took over several shipyards. In 1936, oil was discovered on the bay. By 1946, 13 wells were in operation. In 1990, 498,703 barrels were produced, part of the 77 million barrels produced between 1936 and 1990. Today, tourism is a prosperous industry. Numerous hotels are set up along the bay for individuals wanting to fish, bird or sight-see. A large concentration of hotels are located in Rockport, where the bay's only beach (Rockport Beach) is located.|$|E
25|$|Italian beef is {{made using}} cuts of beef from the sirloin rear or the top/bottom round wet-roasted in broth with garlic, oregano and spices until cooked throughout. The meat is roasted at medium heat (≤350°), which {{contributes}} to the sandwich’s famous ‘jus’ or gravy. This process can result {{in as much as}} a 45% reduction in yield. <b>The</b> <b>beef</b> is then cooled, sliced thin using a deli slicer, and then reintroduced to its reheated beef broth. <b>The</b> <b>beef</b> then sits in the broth, typically for hours. The inefficiency of this process, however, has started to concern many larger Italian beef producers and retailers. In response, some attempt to achieve higher yields by lowering the cooking temperature and placing <b>the</b> <b>beef</b> into food-grade polyester and nylon cook bags, which changes the outer appearance of <b>the</b> <b>beef.</b> Though this reduced time is sufficient for cooking <b>the</b> <b>beef</b> all the way through, it does not allow the jus to be harvested fully. Because traditional Italian beefs are dipped in the jus from their own roast, when this more efficient method is used, the sandwich’s potency is affected. Some companies even add MSG, phosphates and other additives in attempts to reach for higher yields.|$|E
