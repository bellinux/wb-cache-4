500|$|Everyone who was {{fortunate}} enough to be in the audience agreed that it was the musical event of their lives, and after the performance of the last number there was an ovation to the composer which I have never seen equalled anywhere, the entire audience rose to their feet and shouted with enthusiasm, and probably the calmest man in the whole hall was the composer himself; he bowed repeatedly with that distinction of manner which was so typical of him... As calm as Sibelius had appeared on the stage, after his part was over he came up stairs and sank into a chair in one of the dressing rooms and was very much overcome. Some people declared that he wept. Personally I do not think that he did, but <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> his eyes as he shook our hands and thanked us for what he was pleased to call the [...] "honor we had done him".|$|E
2500|$|Schembechler did {{not include}} Wangler in {{his plans for the}} 1980 season, but Wangler spent the summer in Ann Arbor working with {{offensive}} guard Kurt Becker to rehabilitate the knee. [...] Becker recalled that Wangler's recuperation was difficult: [...] "There was so much pain involved that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> his eyes." [...] Wangler described his rehabilitation as follows:"Maybe I was naive, but I never had a doubt I'd play again. [...] I wasn't ready to end my career. [...] I'd do anything to play. [...] The cast came off March 1st and by August 1st I knew I'd be able to play. [...] I worked out four to five hours every day with weights, running, bicycling and swimming." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{first met}} Temple {{in the mid-1980s}} [...] annual [...] conference. Standing on the {{periphery}} of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions. She seemed shy and pleasant, but mostly she just listened. I learned her name was Temple Grandin. It wasn't until later in the week that I realized she was someone with autism. I approached her and asked if she'd be willing to speak at the next year's [...] conference. She agreed. The next year Temple first addressed an [...] audience. People were standing at least three deep. The audience couldn't get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone who could tell us from her own experience, what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive ("like being tied to the rail and the train's coming"). She was asked many questions: [...] "Why does my son do so much spinning?" [...] "Why does he hold his hands to his ears?" [...] "Why doesn't he look at me?" [...] She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> more than one set of eyes that day. Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community.|$|E

6000|$|I shivered, {{and came}} back to myself. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> no <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> my mother's face, only a great pleading. [...] "Never mind, motherâ€”never mind," [...] I said incoherently.|$|R

60|$|He {{turned and}} looked at her in amazement. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> a smile upon her lips, but rather a plaintive one. He had a fancy, somehow, that <b>there</b> had <b>been</b> <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> her eyes lately.|$|R
