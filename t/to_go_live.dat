50|$|After {{talking about}} light, Hawking talks about time in Einstein's theory of relativity. One {{prediction}} that Einstein's theory makes is that time will go by slower {{when something is}} near huge masses. However, when something is {{farther away from the}} mass, time will go by faster. Hawking used the idea of two twins living at different places to describe his idea. If one of the twins <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> on a mountain, and another twin <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> near the sea, the twin who <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> on the mountain would be a little bit younger than the twin who <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> at the sea.|$|R

25|$|While the {{earthquake}} {{quickly became the}} only subject on talkback radio, other early coverage relied on comments from Police and other 24-hour services who were immediately affected and needed {{to communicate with the}} media. Because {{the earthquake}} occurred early on a Saturday morning, with only overnight staff on duty, it took several hours for some media outlets to give the event full live coverage. So it took until mid-morning for some media outlets to have sufficient stories and staff on duty to allow them to commence continuous live broadcasts. One television producer later observed that if the earthquake had happened just a few hours earlier, or later, they would have had a full studio crew on duty and have been able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>live</b> immediately.|$|E

However, due to the leak, the release date had to be pushed up. Oseary recalled that they did not receive a confirmation until Friday night whether the pre-release could be executed, since iTunes was closing for the Christmas weekend. After much discussion on the pros and cons of the release, and with the aid of Interscope vice-chairman Steve Berman, and Apple Inc.'s Robert Kondrk, they were able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>live</b> slowly. The six songs Madonna chose had to be polished, and since the tracks' producers were unavailable, she mastered and mixed them herself. The album's release was compared to Beyoncé's self-titled surprise release in 2013, with The Guardian calling it a [...] "partial Beyoncé". The leaks continued with fourteen new demos being revealed between December 23 and December 27.
