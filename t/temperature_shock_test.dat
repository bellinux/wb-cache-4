40|$|Laser induced forward {{transfer}} is an emerging material deposition technology. We investigated {{the feasibility of}} this technique for printing thermally sensitive, electrically conductive adhesives with and without using an intermediate dynamic release layer. A 248 nm KrF-excimer laser was used to print the epoxy-based conductive adhesives containing silver flakes down to 75 μm dot size. The process is particularly relevant for realizing electrical connections to surface mount devices in the microelectronics industry. Characterization of the printed materials was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, four-point electrical measurements, die-shear <b>testing</b> and <b>temperature</b> <b>shock</b> <b>testing,</b> to establish that {{the properties of the}} adhesive were not affected by direct or indirect laser irradiation.

First, <b>temperature</b> <b>shock</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted {{on a set of}} various chip capacitor components. Tested components were evaluated for the occurred damage and the causing damage mechanisms. Using finite element analysis (FEA) the accumulated solder joint creep strain per cycle was determined and used to establish a life time model based on the Coffin-Manson approach. Second, another set of components was exposed to vibration loading. These components were tested in the as cast and isothermally pre-aged condition. The vibration experiments were accomplished at room and elevated temperature. The evaluation focused on the occurred damage as well as the causing damage mechanisms again. FEA was utilised to determine the maximum von Mises stress of the solder joints. Life time and stress data were merged to define the parameters for a Basquin life time model for the vibration load cases. In a third step sequential experiments were accomplished. Temperature cycling with subsequent vibration loading and vice versa was done.

40|$|International audienceA {{refractory}} material was elaborated from kaolin {{extracted from the}} region of Djebel Debbagh (Algeria). Kaolin grog was obtained by calcination at a temperature of 1350 °C during 1 h. It was used as aggregates with granulometric distribution composed of fine fraction (mean grain size: 100 - 250 µm) and coarse fraction (mean grain size: 1000 - 2500 µm). Crude kaolin (size < 75 µm) was also used as a binder with an amount representing 15 % of the dry material. After a 9. 28 % moistening and a rotting of 1 day, cylindrical samples were shaped by uniaxial pressure at 80 MPa. The samples were submitted to a natural drying during 24 h, a stoving at 100 °C and a calcination at 600 °C during 1 h. They were fired at high temperatures between 1250 and 1450 °C. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that the refractory samples are composed of mullite and silica. Silica {{is a mixture of}} a vitreous phase and cristobalite at 1300, 1350 and 1400 °C and becomes completely amorphous when the samples are fired at higher temperature (1450 °C). The sample porosity is about 30 %. The mechanical tests carried out as a function of temperature revealed different behaviours of the material. From the ambient up to 600 °C, the refractory behaviour is pseudo-plastic caused by micro-cracking. Between 700 and 900 °C, the samples become more rigid. At 1000 °C, the material exhibits a visco-plastic behaviour. The amorphous phase governs the sample properties variation with temperature increasing.

Increased resistance to <b>temperature</b> <b>shock</b> is known to affect life-history traits. <b>Temperature</b> <b>shock</b> is also known to affect reproductive traits such as mating ability and viability of gametes. Therefore selection for increased <b>temperature</b> <b>shock</b> resistance can affect the evolution of reproductive traits. We selected replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster for resistance to cold shock. We then investigated the evolution of reproductive behavior along with other components of fitness- larval survivorship, adult mortality, fecundity, egg viability in these populations. We found that larval survivorship, adult mortality and fecundity post cold shock were not significantly different between selected and control populations. However, compared to the control populations, the selected populations laid significantly higher percentage of fertile eggs (egg viability) 24 hours post cold shock. The selected populations had higher mating frequency both with and without cold shock. After being subjected to cold shock, males from the selected populations successfully mated with significantly more non-virgin females and sired significantly more progeny compared to control males.
