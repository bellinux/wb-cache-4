5|$|In 1995, Favre won {{the first}} of his three AP MVP awards. Favre led <b>the</b> <b>Packers</b> to an 11–5 record, Green Bay's best record in nearly thirty years. Favre passed for a career-high of 4,413yards, 38 touchdowns, and {{recorded}} a quarterback rating of 99.5, which was the highest of his career until he recorded a rating of 107.2 during the 2009 season. Favre also tied an NFL record by passing for at least two touchdowns in twelve consecutive games, a feat he accomplished over the 1994–1995 seasons. <b>The</b> <b>Packers</b> advanced to the NFC Championship Game after upsetting the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Divisional Game. <b>The</b> <b>Packers</b> lost the NFC Championship game to the Dallas Cowboys, marking the third year in a row <b>the</b> <b>Packers</b> season was ended by the Cowboys in the playoffs.

30|$|In {{order to}} study the sealing {{properties}} and structure optimization of <b>the</b> <b>packer</b> rubber at high pressures and high temperatures, the process of <b>the</b> <b>packer</b> rubber setting is simulated using the finite element software ABAQUS to provide a theoretical basis for structure optimization before experiments. In the simulation, some assumptions are made as follows without affecting {{the function of the}} packer: (1) <b>The</b> <b>packer</b> is always located {{in the center of the}} casing and is symmetric around the centerline of the casing; (2) the effect of <b>the</b> <b>packer’s</b> self-weight to simulation results is neglected; (3) only <b>the</b> <b>packer</b> rubber is analyzed, and the bottom calking ring, the center pipe and the casing are stationary in the simulation.|$|R

50|$|When a {{hydrocarbon}} well is hydraulically fractured, {{this is done}} through a production <b>packer</b> (seal), through <b>the</b> drill pipe or tubing. Fluids are circulated down the tubing, to below the point where <b>the</b> <b>packer</b> is sealed against the production casing. Pressure is then be applied only {{that part of the}} casing below <b>the</b> <b>packer.</b> <b>The</b> rest of the well casing will not experience any increase in pressure due to the sealing of <b>the</b> <b>packer.</b> <b>The</b> surface casings do not experience the great pressures experienced at the production zone. This means the stresses on a surface casing are no greater than on a normal oil or gas well. Smaller diameter pipes can sustain much larger pressures than large diameter pipes.|$|R

5|$|Favre led <b>the</b> <b>Packers</b> {{to their}} best season in 30 {{years in the}} 1996 season, winning his second {{consecutive}} MVP award in the process. <b>The</b> <b>Packers</b> led the NFL in points scored (456) as well as fewest points allowed (210), joining only the 1972 Dolphins as the only two teams to ever accomplish this. The defense also set a then NFL record for least amount of touchdowns allowed in a 16-game season with 19. Favre threw for 3,899 yards, a career-high 39 touchdown passes (third highest ever at the time), only 13 interceptions, and passer rating of 95.8 (the third highest of his career). Green Bay tied the Denver Broncos for the NFL's best regular season record, 13–3, defeated the San Francisco 49ers (35–14) and Carolina Panthers (30–13) at Lambeau Field in the playoffs. <b>The</b> <b>Packers</b> advanced to Super Bowl XXXI at the Louisiana Superdome, a short drive from Favre's hometown.|$|E

30|$|At present, most {{scholars}} {{have investigated the}} material properties of <b>packer</b> rubber by <b>the</b> use of dumbbell-shaped specimens and simple cylindrical specimens, and their conclusions indicated that many rubber materials such as HNBR and AFLAS have better pressure resistance and high-temperature resistance. However, {{the influence of the}} actual structures and shapes on sealing performance of packer rubber is seriously considered. <b>The</b> <b>packer</b> rubber made of high-performance material may have poor sealing performance under conditions of high pressure and high temperature in low-permeability reservoirs because of an unreasonable structure. In this paper, the study begins with packer rubber with a conventional structure and optimizes the materials and the structure of <b>the</b> <b>packer</b> rubber by ABAQUS software simulation and experimental research. In the experiments, rubber sleeves are installed on a packer and a function test scheme of <b>the</b> <b>packer</b> is designed which can simulate <b>the</b> <b>packer</b> setting and its working conditions.|$|R
