5|$|Polonium has {{no common}} {{compounds}}, {{and almost all}} of its compounds are synthetically created; more than 50 of <b>those</b> <b>are</b> known. The most stable class of polonium compounds are polonides, which are prepared by direct reaction of two elements. Na2Po has the antifluorite structure, the polonides of Ca, Ba, Hg, Pb and lanthanides form a NaCl lattice, BePo and CdPo have the wurtzite and MgPo the nickel arsenide structure. Most polonides decompose upon heating to about 600°C, except for HgPo that decomposes at ~300°C and the lanthanide polonides, which do not decompose but melt at temperatures above 1000°C. For example, PrPo melts at 1250°C and TmPo at 2200°C. PbPo is {{one of the very few}} naturally occurring polonium compounds, as polonium alpha decays to form lead.|$|E

This total does not include manuscripts with only a part of the work, of which another 100 or so survive. It was printed for the first time between 1474 and 1482, probably at Strasbourg, France. Modern historians have studied the Historia extensively, and a number of editions have been produced. For many years, early Anglo-Saxon history was essentially a retelling of the Historia, but recent scholarship has focused as much on what Bede did not write as what he did. The belief that the Historia was the culmination of Bede's works, the aim of all his scholarship, a belief common among historians in the past, is no longer accepted by most scholars.|$|E
