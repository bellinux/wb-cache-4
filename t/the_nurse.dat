40|$|Abstrakt <b>The</b> keeping of <b>nursing</b> {{documentation}} is an inseparable part of {{the work}} of a nurse. It is an instrument of professional practice, which is intended to support the process of care. The quality of the keeping of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> documentation {{is a reflection of the}} level of professional practice. <b>The</b> <b>nursing</b> documentation is an invaluable manner of supporting communication within the framework of the health care team and between the health workers and their patients/clients. Well kept nursing documentation is thus the product of good teamwork and at the same time an important instrument for increasing the quality of care. An audit is one of the parts of the management process and its final aim is to incease the quality of the provided care. An audit can play an important role during the delivery of the quality of the provided care and this is also true for the process of the keeping of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> documentation. During an audit of the kept documentation areas are identified where it is intended to ensure the improvement and education of the staff. The theoretical part the work also includes chapters related to the given problems that is <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> aim, <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> process, <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> documentation, <b>the</b> quality of <b>nursing</b> care and <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> audit. In <b>the</b> research part I deal with the influence of the audit of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> documentation on <b>the</b> quality of <b>the</b> provided <b>nursing</b> care. <b>The</b> aim of my research is to ascertain the influence of the standard of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> documentation on <b>the</b> quality of <b>nursing</b> care and to ascertain whether the results of the audit of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> documentation help <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> in <b>the</b> wards to improve the quality of <b>the</b> provided <b>nursing</b> care. During <b>the</b> research my first hypothesis that the quality of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> care is increased by the carrying out of a standard ``Unified keeping of nursing documentation`` was confirmed and 26 of <b>the</b> questionned <b>nurses</b> (57 %) agreed with it. The second hypothesis, that the quality of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> care is increased by the introduction of an audit of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> documentation into practice, was not confirmed. Only 18 of <b>the</b> interviewed <b>nurses</b> (39 %) think that the introduced audit of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> documentation into practice is an increase in the quality of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> care. In order to obtain the required data to accomplish the aims and answer the hypothesis of quantitative research I used a method of auditing and an enquiry method using questionnaires.

40|$|A nursing {{research}} {{is an integral}} part of <b>the</b> <b>nursing.</b> An implementation of research activities in this field makes a basis for an improving of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> care and a development of the discipline itself. For nurses working in a clinical department who should carry out research investigations, there is important a knowledge how to conduct investigations and a support from the hospital management. Without this support they could not put the research results into practice which is currently based more on standard procedures. A theoretical part of the thesis deals with <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> research, research concepts and its historical development. Then it also discusses ethical principles of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> research, nursesÂ´ fundamental roles, evidence-based activities, opportunities of the research funding in the Czech Republic and an evaluation of a scientific work. An aim of the thesis was to establish the awareness, participation and interest of the primary and secondary level management in <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> research. We have identified four hypotheses which we verified by a quantitative survey. H 1 : More general nurses with a higher education participate in <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> research than <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> who are graduates of the secondary medical school. H 2 : General nurses-managers who completed a university education are better prepared for an implementation of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> research than nurses-managers with the secondary education. H 3 : The primary and secondary level nursing management of Hospital in ÄŒeskÃ© BudÄ›jovice participate in <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> research more than the management from other hospitals in the South Bohemian Region. H 4 : <b>The</b> <b>nursing</b> management which is involved in <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> research apply <b>the</b> research results into practice. The quantitative survey was made by a questionnaire technique. The research sample consisted of <b>nurses</b> working on <b>the</b> positions of the secondary and primary level managers in the inpatients departments of hospitals in the South Bohemian Region. The investigation was conducted in eight hospitals in the South Bohemian Region. It is possible to say, that the awareness of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> {{research is}} on a good level, nearly half of <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> monitor and apply the information and the research results in their clinical practice as well as most nurses are ready to implement either a simple research survey or to participate in the research under a guidance or to prepare and implement an independent research project. We believe that <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> should be interested in <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> research, but not as a part of their normal duties which they have in their workplace. For a development in <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> field it is necessary to increase a further awareness of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> research and to encourage <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> so that they should be interested to conduct this research.

A key research finding was ward nursesâ€™ equivocal attitudes to <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> record. On <b>the</b> one hand, because of its links with <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> process, <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> record was highly valued {{as a symbol of}} professionalism and ward staff were loathe to criticise it directly.

In this paper it is suggested that at one level, nursesâ€™ ambivalence towards <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> record reflected <b>the</b> distortion of its founding philosophy by the new managerialism in the contemporary UK health care context.
