5|$|I, Euthalius, {{wrote this}} {{volume of the}} Apostle Paul as {{carefully}} as possible in stichoi, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be read with intelligence: the book was compared with the copy in the library at Caesarea, written by the hand of Pamphilius the saint.|$|E
5|$|In late 1998, Polish {{physicist}} Robert Smolańczuk published calculations on {{the fusion}} of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms, including oganesson and livermorium. His calculations suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be possible to make these two elements by fusing lead with krypton under carefully controlled conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{mother of}} the two McCaig {{brothers}} visited the site of their deaths in May 1972. She expressed a wish to leave a monument to her sons but was advised <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> well be damaged by vandals. She later {{said that she was}} touched by the wreaths and flowers that had been left at the spot.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} the product {{and the manner in}} which it is {{processed}} led to concerns <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be a risk to human health, despite the fact that there have been no reported cases of foodborne illnesses due to consumption of the product. Among consumers, media reporting significantly reduced its acceptance as an additive to ground beef.|$|E
5|$|A trophy {{handover}} {{ceremony was}} held in Rome on 21 April 2009, at which Ole Gunnar Solskjær, representing Manchester United as the previous season's champions, returned the trophy to UEFA president Michel Platini. Platini then presented the trophy to Gianni Alemanno, the Mayor of Rome, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be put on display {{in and around the}} city until the day of the final. Also present at the ceremony were the president and vice-president of the Italian Football Federation, Giancarlo Abete and Demetrio Albertini, the ambassador for the final, Bruno Conti, and Emilio Di Toro on behalf of the Italian National Olympic Committee.|$|E
5|$|As Threni was {{intended}} for concert rather than liturgical use, Stravinsky chose the text freely from the early chapters of the Book of Lamentations. It has three movements: the large central movement is surrounded by two much shorter ones. Ernst Krenek composed a setting of the Lamentations in 1942, and Stravinsky acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have influenced him. He considered it less likely that works by Renaissance composers, including Tallis, Byrd and Palestrina, had influenced him, although he had studied such music.|$|E

5|$|Biographer Lanny Ebenstein noted a drift {{over time}} in Friedman's views from an interventionist to a more {{cautious}} foreign policy. He supported US involvement in the Second World War and initially supported a hard line against Communism, but moderated over time. However Friedman did state in a 1995 interview {{that he is an}} anti-interventionist. He opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War. In a spring 2006 interview, Friedman said that the USA's stature in the world had been eroded by the Iraq War, but <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be improved if Iraq were to become a peaceful and independent country.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its role}} in {{establishing}} the General Synod, the Pennsylvania Ministerium withdrew from the inter-Lutheran organization in 1823. Within the Ministerium, there was a close relationship between Lutheran and Reformed congregations, and many felt that the General Synod might jeopardize that relationship. In addition, many in the Ministerium were wary of a centralized organization, and the control <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> exert over individual congregations.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1995, the Pyxis {{globular}} cluster is a 13.3 ± 1.3 billion year-old {{globular cluster}} situated around 130,000 light-years distant from Earth and around 133,000 light-years {{distant from the}} centre of the Milky Way—a region not previously thought to contain globular clusters. Located in the galactic halo, it was noted to lie on the same plane as the Large Magellanic Cloud and the possibility has been raised <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be an escaped object from that galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Fears then arose for the engine's future, the {{speculation}} being <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> {{remain in the}} US or even be broken up. After Alan Bloom made a personal phone call to him in January 1973, William McAlpine stepped in and bought the locomotive for £25,000 direct from the finance company in San Francisco docks. After its return to the UK via the Panama Canal in February 1973, McAlpine paid for the locomotive's restoration at Derby Works.|$|E
5|$|In 1781, Carl Wilhelm Scheele {{discovered}} that a new acid, tungstic acid, could be made from scheelite (at the time named tungsten). Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid. In 1783, José and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid. Later that year, at the Royal Basque Society {{in the town of}} Bergara, Spain, the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten by reduction of this acid with charcoal, and they are credited with the discovery of the element.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Elizabeth Johnson {{discovered}} {{the remains of}} a Pawnee village in Republic County, Kansas. She thought <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be the site of Pike's flag incident; but hearing of another village in Webster County, Nebraska, she dispatched her husband and another man to investigate this site. Because the surface had been altered by cultivation, they found little evidence of habitation, and Johnson was persuaded that the Republic County site was Pike's village. She prevented its being plowed on several occasions, and eventually purchased the land.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, {{the owner}} of the tower, H. J. Wood, {{discussed}} selling it to the Commissioners of Works, proposing a price of approximately £1,500; the negotiations broke down. By the 1930s, local magistrates expressed concern about the tower and the risk <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> fall over onto the grounds of a neighbouring private asylum, the Kent Sanatorium, endangering the patients. As an alternative to demolition, it was taken into the guardianship of the Office of Works in 1937.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the second investigation, a case was being prepared against Det Ch Supt Melvin and Det Insp Dingle. In July 1992 Melvin was charged with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and Dingle with conspiracy. In 1994 their lawyers applied for access to information from Nove's inquiry, on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> help their clients; anything that implicated Winston Silcott would support the detectives' contention that their interview notes were genuine and that Silcott really had, in effect, confessed. The lawyers also argued that the detectives should not be prosecuted until all related criminal proceedings had concluded.|$|E
5|$|Jerry {{is unable}} {{to decide whether or}} not to tell George he is dating Marlene, but Jerry's ex-girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) {{eventually}} convinces him that he should. After being informed, George informs Jerry he has no problem with him dating Marlene. The following night, Jerry asks Marlene to come to his apartment, but she tells him <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be better not to date him anymore. Jerry asks her why, to which she replies that she did not think his stand-up comedy act was funny, and that she could not date someone if she did not respect what they did.|$|E

5|$|Lee and Yang's {{research}} into existing experimental results convinced them that parity was conserved for electromagnetic interactions {{and for the}} strong interaction. For this reason, scientists had expected that {{it would also be}} true for the weak interaction, but it had not been tested, and Lee and Yang's theoretical studies showed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> not hold true for the weak interaction. Lee and Yang worked out a pencil-and-paper design of an experiment for testing conservation of parity in the laboratory. Lee then turned to Wu for her expertise in choosing and then working out the hardware manufacture, set-up, and laboratory procedures for carrying out this experiment.|$|E
5|$|New South Wales and Victoria {{had signed}} an {{agreement}} towards constructing bridges for railways over the Murray to serve the settlements on the northern side. In 1923, a report was released that recommended going ahead with the building of four bridges, one of those being the future Abbotsford Bridge. It was said a bridge in this area would benefit Curlwaa, Wentworth, and a proposed irrigation scheme to the north. The cost was estimated at £78,000. It had been considered <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be appropriate to combine these four bridges with locks, but this idea was rejected due to siting concerns.|$|E
5|$|Preventive {{detention}} {{has been}} preferred over open court trials, {{as it has}} been suggested that the criminal trial could be used as a platform for radicals to publicize their views, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> confer the honour of martyrdom on accused persons. However, {{it has been suggested that}} an open trial which details the evils of terrorism and the indiscriminate destruction that it causes could educate the public and potentially unite the various communities in the country.|$|E
