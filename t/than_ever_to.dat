The DVD is a double-disc and has nearly five hours of footage, containing the feature documentary Walk with Me in Hell and multiple live performance extras from the Sacrament World Tour. At {{the end of the}} Walk with Me in Hell documentary the members stated that they are more excited <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> write new material.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, Victoria became {{seriously ill}} of typhoid fever {{on the last}} of the royal tours. Exploiting her {{weakened}} state, the Duchess and Conroy unsuccessfully tried to force her into signing a document; this document would have appointed Conroy her personal secretary upon her accession. Victoria emerged from the incident more determined <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> become self-reliant. Her increased intransigence alarmed the Duchess. At her behest, family adviser Baron Stockmar investigated, recommending to the Duchess that she dismiss Conroy and make peace with her daughter. But Conroy easily convinced the Duchess to ignore Stockmar's advice. Even after Victoria's eighteenth birthday on 24 May 1837, Conroy continued to pressure her to appoint him as her private secretary or acknowledge her need for a regent until she turned twenty-one.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{were kept}} in cramped and squalid {{conditions}} at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages {{was built in the}} 1870s. Further changes took place in the early twentieth century, when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures more closely resembling a natural habitat, with concrete 'rocks', more open space and a moat instead of bars. He designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo, among others, in the early twentieth century. Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos. In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> the animals, with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park.|$|E

5|$|Meru, Lyme, {{and their}} allies travel to Germany to find the Magician, another former agent. They arrive {{during one of the}} Magician's acts and Meru unintentionally negates her abilities, ruining the performance. This angers the Magician, who decides to ally herself with the Eraser out of spite. The Eraser's {{recruits}} use the Magician's help to set a trap for Lyme, Duncan, and Perrier. Lyme is beaten into a coma and left for dead, although he is found by passersby and taken to a hospital. Duncan and Perrier escape, but are now disconnected from Meru and the others. Meanwhile, Meru, Bill, and Dusty follow up a different lead in Hong Kong. They too are attacked by the Eraser, resulting in Dusty and Bill's deaths. Meru escapes, and is now more resolved <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> stop the Eraser.|$|E
5|$|The balloon {{had carried}} {{a lot of}} food, of a kind adapted more for a balloon voyage than for travels on foot. Andrée had {{reasoned}} that {{they might as well}} throw excess food overboard as sand, if losing weight was necessary; and if it was not, the food would serve if wintering in the Arctic desert did after all become necessary. There was therefore less ballast and large amounts of heavy-type provisions, 767kg (1690lb) altogether, including 200liters of water and some crates of champagne, port, beer, etc., donated by sponsors and manufacturers. There was also lemon juice, though not as much of this precaution against scurvy as other polar explorers usually thought necessary. Much of the food was in the form of cans of pemmican, meat, sausages, cheese, and condensed milk. By the time they crashed, they had thrown some of it overboard. The three men took most of the rest with them on leaving the crash site, along with other necessities such as guns, tent, ammunition, and cooking utensils, making a load on each sled of more than 200kg (440lb). This was not realistic, as it broke the sleds and wore out the men. After one week, they sorted out and left behind a big pile of food and non-essential equipment, bringing the loads down to 130kg per sled. It became more necessary <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> hunt for food. They shot and ate seals, walruses, and especially polar bears throughout the march.|$|E

The king attempted unsuccessfully to have the constitution amended. On March 2, 1955, he announced his abdication in favor of his father, Norodom Suramarit. Assuming the title of samdech (prince), Sihanouk explained that this action was necessary in order to give him a free hand to engage in politics.|$|E

25|$|Hazlitt {{followed}} this by {{many years as}} a literary, art, and theatre critic, at which he enjoyed some success. He was subsequently beset by numerous personal problems, including a failed marriage, illness, insolvency, a disastrous love entanglement {{that led to a}} mental breakdown, and scurrilous attacks by political conservatives, many of them fueled by his indiscreet publication of Liber Amoris, a thinly disguised autobiographical account of his love affair. English society was becoming increasingly prudish, the ensuing scandal effectively destroyed his reputation, and he found it harder <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> earn a living. He married a second time. Consequently, more than ever in need of money, he was forced to churn out article after article for the periodical press.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, {{male-to-female}} sex change {{operations were}} becoming more {{widely available in}} Europe, and Breckinridge expressed many times his desire to undergo the procedure. With the nationwide attention given to Christine Jorgensen's sex change in 1952, Breckinridge became more determined <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> begin transitioning. In 1954, he announced plans to travel to Denmark and undergo the operation so he could marry his male secretary. Though Breckinridge was by this time a grandparent, his granddaughter supported him in his efforts. Shortly thereafter, a San Francisco judge scuttled his Denmark trip by ordering him into court for failing {{to make good on}} an earlier agreement to pay $8,500 a year to support his elderly, blind mother in England. He then made arrangements with a sex-change surgeon in Mexico, but had a serious car accident while traveling there. He gave up his pursuit of the matter afterwards.|$|E
25|$|As a key {{facet of}} the {{public-private}} partnership with Sarasota, Angelos developed a unique “sisterhood city” integrated marketing approach {{to capitalize on the}} power of the Baltimore Orioles and Major League Baseball to create economic impact through tourism incubation for the city. The approach utilizes the Orioles’ multiplatform media assets to market Sarasota to consumers in the Mid-Atlantic region year-round. According to the Sarasota Convention and Visitors Bureau, visits and inquiries from Mid-Atlantic residents have increased by double-digits since the partnership began. The partnership was recognized by industry publication Sports Business Journal for providing the “marketing muscle” necessary to generate the tourist dollars that are “more important <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> making the spring training business equation work.” In late 2013, the Tampa Bay Business Journal heralded the results of the partnership in a cover story, describing the deal as a home run for Sarasota’s tourism industry.|$|E

25|$|Wilson {{described}} {{the size of}} Haldane’s planned Expeditionary Force (six divisions of three brigades each and a cavalry division of four brigades) as simply a “reshuffle” of the troops available in Britain, and often declared that “there was no military problem to which the answer was six divisions”. Foch {{is supposed to have}} told Wilson that he would be happy for Britain to send just a corporal and four men, provided it was right {{from the start of the}} war, and that he promised to get them killed, so that Britain would come into the war with all her strength. Foch, recently returned from a visit to Russia, was concerned that France might not be able to count on Russian support in the event of war, and was more keen <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> enlist British military aid. He invited Wilson and Colonel Fairholme, British military attaché in Paris, to his daughter’s wedding in October 1910. On a visit to London (6 December 1910) Wilson took him for a meeting with Sir Arthur Nicolson, Permanent-Under Secretary at the Foreign Office.|$|E

[...] Drummer Phil Collins, having a temporary break from Genesis after his first marriage had failed, was at a loose end and asked to replace Moon, but Townshend had already asked Jones, who had previously played with the Small Faces and the Faces. Jones officially joined the band in November 1978. John [...] "Rabbit" [...] Bundrick joined the live band as an unofficial keyboardist.

500|$|The {{reviewer}} for Time {{acknowledged the}} critical storm around Fleming and Dr. No, but was broadly welcoming of the book, writing that while [...] "not all readers will agree that Dr. No... is magnificent writing,... pages of it, at least, qualify for Ezra Pound's classic comment on Tropic of Cancer: 'At last, an unprintable {{book that is}} readable'." [...] In The New York Times, Anthony Boucher—described by Fleming's biographer John Pearson as [...] "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—was again damning of Fleming's work, saying [...] "it's harder <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> see why an ardent coterie so admires Ian Fleming's tales". Benson described Boucher's critique as [...] "true to form" [...] and [...] "a tirade" [...] as Boucher concluded his review by saying: [...] "it is 80,000 words long, with enough plot for 8,000 and enough originality for 800." ...|$|E

[...] Following the character's recreation as Oracle, she is shown having overcome her paralysis {{at the hands of}} the Joker by utilizing her intellect to once again engage in crime-fighting as an information broker. Speaking on her characterization as a person living with a disability, comic writer Devin Grayson stated that being [...] "yper-defensive about her , she has, if anything, over compensated. However, her very determination to remain self-reliant, though admirable and inspiring, has made her less willing <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>to</b> accept support or aid of any kind." ...|$|E
