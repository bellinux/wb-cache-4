5|$|Emperor {{penguins}} are serially monogamous. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> one mate each year, {{and stay}} faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years {{is only about}} 15%. The narrow window of opportunity available for mating {{appears to be an}} influence, as there is a priority to mate and breed which often precludes waiting for the appearance of the previous year's partner.|$|E
5|$|Horseshoe crabs, {{which are}} aquatic, use {{external}} fertilization, {{in other words}} the sperm and ova meet outside the parents' bodies. Their trilobite-like larvae look rather like miniature adults as they have full sets of appendages and eyes, but initially <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> two pairs of book-gills and gain three more pairs as they molt.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{reproduce}} rapidly because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> a few genes {{compared to}} humans who have 20,000–25,000. For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and rotavirus has eleven. These genes encode structural proteins {{that form the}} virus particle, or non-structural proteins, that are only found in cells infected by the virus.|$|E

5|$|Andorra's first {{official}} game was a 6–1 defeat {{in a friendly}} match to Estonia in 1996. Since the qualifying rounds for the UEFA Euro 2000 tournament, Andorra have competed in qualifying for every European Championship and World Cup but have had very little success. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> ever won five matches, four of them at home. They have two wins in competitive matches, 1–0 wins against Macedonia in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying competition and against Hungary in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying competition.|$|E
5|$|France {{traditionally}} play in blue {{shirts with}} white shorts and red socks, and are {{commonly referred to}} as les tricolores or les bleus. The French emblem is a golden rooster imposed upon a red shield. Their alternative strip is composed of a white shirt and navy blue shorts and socks. French international matches are played at several venues across the country; the Stade de France in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis is used for their games during the Six Nations, and they have a formidable home record at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille where <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> lost twice, to Argentina in 2004 and to New Zealand in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Further afield, {{the club}} has a rivalry with Bristol City, known as the Severnside derby, {{and to a lesser}} extent, Bristol Rovers. There is also a lesser rivalry with Welsh {{neighbours}} Newport County due to the proximity of the two Welsh cities. However, they have rarely played against each another since the 1980s due to Cardiff being in higher leagues. In total <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> ever played 20 football league games against each other. A survey by Football Fans Census in 2003 saw Swansea, Bristol City and Newport listed as Cardiff's main three rivalries, with Stoke City matching Newport in third.|$|E

5|$|The first {{official}} game {{played by a}} San Marino team was a 4–0 defeat in a European Championships qualifier by Switzerland in 1990. Previously, a San Marino side had lost 1–0 to a Canadian Olympic team in 1986, {{but this was not}} an official match. Since making their competitive bow, San Marino have competed in qualifying for every European Championships and World Cup, but have never won a match in either competition. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> ever won one game, beating Liechtenstein 1–0 in a friendly match on 28 April 2004.|$|E
5|$|While Wally goes to {{a funeral}} home to attend {{the wake of a}} former estate client, the client's son claims that his father was killed by Krayoxx, a {{cholesterol-lowering}} drug developed by the (fictional) pharmaceutical company Varrick Labs. Ecstatic at the possible monetary returns on the case, the firm finds several former clients who appear to have valid claims about Krayoxx. Oscar and Wally generate publicity in the Chicago Tribune with a picture of their filing; this induces an avalanche of communications and leads them to several additional claimants. However, Wally and his fellows are far out of their depth. None of the three Finley & Figg lawyers has ever argued in a United States federal court, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> a vague idea of what is involved in confronting a major corporation which is able to hire the best legal talent around - which turns out to be Zinc's old firm.|$|E
5|$|On the field, the Australians—captained by Richie Benaud—were successful. They {{defeated}} Pakistan 2–0 {{in three}} Tests, and India 2–1 over five matches. Australia’s only other Test win on Pakistani soil came in 1998 and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> won two series in India since the Benaud-Loxton expedition. They also remained unbeaten outside the Test matches. Despite the success with bat and ball, the Australians were struck down by serious illness {{during the second}} part of their tour in India, despite taking Dr. Ian McDonald—a former Victorian first-class cricketer—with the travelling party. Gordon Rorke, Lindsay Kline and Gavin Stevens all contracted hepatitis; the former two were sent home, while the latter was too ill to fly back to Australia {{until the end of the}} tour. Harvey said that Stevens—who never played first-class cricket again after his illness—"could've been the first man to die on tour". Due to the bevy of unfit players, Loxton was forced to line up in one game, against Indian Universities in Bangalore, two years after playing his last first-class match. He scored 33 and bowled six overs without taking a wicket in a high-scoring draw.|$|E
