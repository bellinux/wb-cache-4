5|$|By 1939, it {{was clear}} that war was looming, and the team began to turn <b>their</b> <b>primary</b> {{attention}} from ASV back to AI. A new set, built by combining the transmitter unit from the latest ASV units with the EMI receiver, first flew in a Battle in May 1939. The system demonstrated a maximum range that was barely adequate, around , but the too-long minimum range proved to be a far greater problem.|$|E
5|$|HMS Active was {{the name}} ship of her class of three scout cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the 1910s.

5|$|HMS Hotspur was {{inspired}} by a series of French coast-defence ships with the ram as <b>their</b> <b>primary</b> weapon. The layout of Glatton was modified with a fixed turret and her freeboard was increased over that of the older ship. The single 12-inch gun was mounted on a turntable and could pivot at each gun port to maximise its arc of fire. It was nominally capable of firing forward, but this proved to damage the upper deck.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} the luminosity functions (LFs) and projected number density profiles of galactic satellites around isolated primaries of differing luminosity. To this end, we {{develop a new}} method to select isolated galactic satellite systems using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic and photometric galaxy samples. For specific luminosity primaries, {{we are able to}} stack as many as 50, 000 galaxy systems to obtain robust statisitcal results. Based on these samples, we derive accurate satellite luminosity functions extending almost 8 magnitudes fainter than <b>their</b> <b>primaries</b> and accurate projected number densities profiles of satellites down to 4 magnitudes fainter than <b>their</b> <b>primaries.</b> Then, we determine how the satellite luminosity functions and projected number density profiles vary with both the properties of their satellites and <b>their</b> <b>primaries.</b> In addition, we find that the normalized profiles can be well fitted by the NFW profiles in most cases. The dependence of the NFW concentration parameters on the luminosity of the satellites and <b>their</b> <b>primaries</b> are explored. Inspired by the similar independent study, we also explore the dependence of estimates of satellite luminosity functions on two different background subtraction methods. We then measure these quantities for model satellites placed into the Millennium and Millennium II dark matter simulations by the GALFORM semi-analytic galaxy formation model for different bins of primary galaxy magnitude. We compare our model predictions to the data that we previously measured. The generally successful comparison of the GALFORM model with the SDSS data performed here provides a non-trivial validation of the assumptions and framework of this kind of modelling. ...|$|R

California and New Jersey moved <b>their</b> <b>primaries</b> to February for the 2008 election, but in 2012 both states ended up moving them back to June. California lawmakers stated that consolidating their presidential and statewide primary election in June saves them about $100 million, {{and that it is}} not worth the cost when there is generally no competitive balance between the two political parties within California.|$|R
