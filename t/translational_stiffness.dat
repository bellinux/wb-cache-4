40|$|The {{interactions}} between stiffness and workspace performances are studied. The stiffness in x, y and z directions {{as well as}} the workspace of a 3 -UPU mechanism are studied and optimized. The stiffness of the robotic system in every single moveable direction is measured and analyzed, and it is observed that in the case where one tries to make the x and y <b>translational</b> <b>stiffness</b> larger, the z directional stiffness will be reduced, i. e. the x and y <b>translational</b> <b>stiffness</b> contradicts with the one in z direction. Subsequently, the objective functions for the summation of the x and y <b>translational</b> <b>stiffness</b> and z directional stiffness are established and they are being optimized simultaneously. However, we later found that these two objectives are not in the same scale; a normalization of the objectives is thus taken into consideration. Meanwhile, the robotic system’s workspace is studied and optimized. Through comparing the stiffness landscape and the workspace volume landscape, it is also observed that the z <b>translational</b> <b>stiffness</b> shows the same changing tendency with the workspace volume’s changing tendency while the x and y <b>translational</b> <b>stiffness</b> shows the opposite changing tendency compared to the workspace volume’s. Via employing the Pareto front theory and differential evolution, the summation of the x and y <b>translational</b> <b>stiffness</b> and the volume of the workspace are being simultaneously optimized.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{resilience}} of the steel studs on the sound insulation of steel stud cavity walls can be modelled as an equivalent <b>translational</b> <b>stiffness</b> in simple models for predicting the sound insulation of walls. Numerical calculations (Poblet-Puig et al., 2009) have shown that this equivalent <b>translational</b> <b>stiffness</b> varies with frequency. Vigran (2010 a) has derived a best-fit third order polynomial approximation to the logarithm of these numerical values {{as a function of}} the logarithm of the frequency for the most common type of steel stud. This paper uses an inverse ex-perimental technique. It determines the values of the equivalent <b>translational</b> <b>stiffness</b> of steel studs which make Davy’s (2010) sound insulation theory agree best with experimental sound insulation data from the National Research Council of Canada (NRCC) (Halliwell et al., 1998) for 126 steel stud cavity walls with gypsum plasterboard on each side of the steel studs and sound absorbing material in the wall cavity. These values are approximately constant as a function of frequency up to 400 Hz. Above 400 Hz they increase approximately as a non-integer power of the fre-quency. The equivalent <b>translational</b> <b>stiffness</b> also depends on the mass per unit surface area of the cladding on each side of the steel studs and on the width of the steel studs. Above 400 Hz, this stiffness also depends on the stud spac-ing.

40|$|The strive {{of architects}} for maximum {{transparency}} and maximum lightness encounters {{issues in the}} cold-formed steel building industry. Closely spaced vertical members are needed to develop the unique properties these structures have, resulting however in only small openings. To increase the transparency of cold-formed steel frames, traditional sheeting materials which are screwed onto the frame are replaced by glass panes which are adhesively bonded to the frame using a structural sealant. In case of such structural hybrid cold-formed steel-glass elements, the sealant-glass system restrains the cold-formed steel members vertically, horizontally and rotationally. In this research, the horizontal <b>translational</b> <b>stiffness</b> of a linear structural sealant connection between cold-formed steel members and monolithic glass panels is determined by means of experimental testing. This paper reports about the obtained data from these experiments. Box-type specimens consisting of two cold-formed steel C-sections or tubular sections adhesively ‘sandwiched’ between two monolithic glass panels were subjected to a tensile force, such that shear must develop in the structural sealant. The horizontal <b>translational</b> <b>stiffness</b> k derived from the experimental relationship between the applied load and the relative displacement between glass and steel, had the same order of magnitude as comparable traditional screwed cold-formed steel-OSB or cold-formed steel-gypsum connections.

40|$|This {{project will}} {{investigate}} {{the economic and}} technical potential of decoupled drive structures for servo presses. The original working hypotheses about economic potentials that decoupling leads to -higher dynamics, -Energy savings and -lower cost, were undetectable. These effects occur only to a small extent {{even in the best}} case. Nevertheless, one can see in the decoupling of the drive trains economic potential. This refers mainly to the development of universal drive modules. Through such modules, possibly designed by modular principle, the design and manufacturing costs for servo presses can be reduced. Another aspect is the possibility of the flexible arrangement of these modules without geometric restrictions that result from the coupling elements. For analysis of the technical potential of decoupled drive structures initially a property analysis of the coupled machine was performed and their tilting behavior was determined. It was found that the resulting tilt of the plunger is determined by three effects 1. <b>translational</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the drive trains (eccentric gear, connecting rod, stroke adjustment, overload protection); 2. <b>translational</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the press frame; 3. rotatory stiffness of the coupling shaft. The synchronization of the drive train is of significant importance for the decoupled drive structure. There have been developed and implemented various concepts for the synchronization control. The classic synchronization concept shows almost the same tilting behavior as the coupled drive structure. This behavior was expected, since in this case only the coupling shaft has been replaced by an "electric shaft". An extension of this concept by a superimposed tilt controller, which is to compensate the influence of the <b>translational</b> <b>stiffness,</b> proved to be problematic. The reason is the strong tendency to instability of this controller, caused by clearance and non-linearities in the drive train. The expected improvement of the tilting behavior could not be detected...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide the stiffness and strength characteristics for cold-formed steel stud walls stabilized by sheathing. The primary stability resistance is provided by translational (lateral) stiffness supplied at the fastener locations to the cold-formed steel studs. This paper separates the source of this <b>translational</b> <b>stiffness</b> into two parts: local and diaphragm. To analyze the local stiffness an experimental study consisting of small-scale stud-fastener-sheathing assemblies is conducted. In these tests sheathing type, stud spacing, fastener spacing, edge distance, environmental conditions, and construction flaws are all varied. The results provide characterization of the local stiffness and strength that is supplied as the fasteners bear and rotate in a stud-sheathing assembly. Results are sensitive to the design variables (stud, fastener, sheathing, spacing) as well as the environmental and construction conditions. Diaphragm stiffness develops as the sheathing itself undergoes shear, which also translates into a lateral resistance at the fastener locations. A simple analytical model for the <b>translational</b> <b>stiffness</b> supplied by the sheathing diaphragm action is proposed and validated. The importance of including both local and diaphragm stiffness is illustrated with a test on a full-scale cold-formed steel stud wall. For the first time, this paper provides a comprehensive bracing model for sheathing-braced stud walls which include both local and diaphragm stiffness. ...|$|E

Abstract: This work proposes {{the use of}} quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs) as a method to analyze and {{characterize}} magnetorheological (MR) fluids. QCM devices are sensitive to changes in mass, surface interactions, and viscoelastic properties of the medium contacting its surface. These features make the QCM suitable to study MR fluids and their response to variable environmental conditions.

In this work, the measurement of the resonance parameters (resonance frequency and dissipation factor) of a QCM are used to analyze the behavior of MR fluids in static conditions (that is, in the absence of external mechanical stresses).

The measured stiffness values and their time dependence can be interpreted with a model that describes the phagocytic cup as a prestressed membrane connected to an elastically deformable actin cortex. In the context of this model, the stiffness peak is a direct manifestation of a previously described mechanical bottleneck, and a comparison of model and data suggests that the membrane advances around the particle at a speed of about 20 nm s- 1. This approach is a novel way of measuring the progression of emerging phagocytic cups and their mechanical properties in situ and in real time...|$|R

However, stiffness evaluation in the general case when force-and-torque load coupling takes place leads to some problems. The problems are associated with physical distinction between <b>translational</b> and rotational <b>stiffness</b> values manifested, in particular, in their different units of measurement. To overcome a majority of the difficulties, a new performance index – the collinear stiffness value (CSV) presenting an equivalent stiffness (compliance) value during simultaneous linear and rotational displacements – is developed and represented in static and dynamic versions. In this presentation, the CSV is used to formulate a new design-related dimensionless criterion: the ratio of the minimal CSV to stiffness value of the drive system, which usually presents a weak point of the modern machines. The CSV-based approach is applied to quantitative formulation of the significant advantage from the stiffness viewpoint of the orthogonal serial-kinematics machines (SKM) compared with the parallel-kinematics machines (PKM) : (a) the parameters-of-motion-depending variations of the minimal CSV of the SKM in their workspace are, as a rule, one-two orders of magnitude less than those of the PKMs; (b) the stiffness-limited workspace of the SKM is more than that of the PKM. Application examples are simulated...|$|R
