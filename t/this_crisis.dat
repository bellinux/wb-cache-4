5|$|According to Cassius Dio, a {{financial}} crisis emerged in AD 39. Suetonius places the beginning of <b>this</b> <b>crisis</b> in 38. Caligula's political payments for support, generosity and extravagance had exhausted the state's treasury. Ancient historians state that Caligula began falsely accusing, fining and even killing individuals {{for the purpose of}} seizing their estates.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>crisis</b> led him {{to apply}} to lecture on {{philosophy}} rather than mathematics. He also began an intense study of Elizabethan literature thinking there might be evidence that Francis Bacon wrote the plays attributed to Shakespeare (see Shakespearean authorship question); this ultimately resulted in two pamphlets, published in 1896 and 1897.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeat in}} World War I, Germany was plunged into bankruptcy, social injustice, poverty, crime and mass unemployment. During these {{depressing}} years, Germany saw {{the creation of}} a number of extremist political and paramilitary associations, representing both the far-left and the far-right. Amidst <b>this</b> <b>crisis,</b> Schaub decided to join the National Socialist German Workers Party, later commonly known as the Nazi Party; he became member #81. The political program of the party was essentially a rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, antisemitism, and anti-Bolshevism, driven by Adolf Hitler and his world view.|$|E

5|$|During the 1860s and the American Civil War, the {{legislature}} {{was the scene}} of intense debate. At the beginning of the war, the General Assembly was controlled by the southern sympathetic Democrats. Governor Oliver Morton and the Republican minority were able to prevent the General Assembly from meeting in 1862 and 1863 by denying the body quorum. Morton even had some members of the body arrested or detained on suspicions of disloyalty. The lack of funding created by <b>this</b> <b>crisis</b> again led to the near bankruptcy of the state. In 1864, the Republicans gained a majority and convened the General Assembly to remedy the state's funding problems.|$|E

5|$|Anglo-Saxons kings {{produced}} coins {{from the}} 620s onwards, initially in gold, {{but then in}} electrum (an alloy of gold and silver) and eventually pure silver. Little is known of the organisation of coinage {{during the reign of}} Beonna, but it can be presumed that the moneyers who struck coins during this period acted {{under the auspices of the}} king, who would to some extent have supervised the design of his coins. A growing shortage of available bullion in north-western Europe during the first half of the 8th century was probably the main cause for a deterioration in the proportion of precious metal found in locally produced sceattas. In around 740, Eadberht of Northumbria became the first king to respond to <b>this</b> <b>crisis</b> by issuing a remodelled coinage, of a consistent weight and a high proportion of silver, which eventually replaced the debased currency. Other kings followed his example, including Beonna and the Frankish king Pepin the Short, who appears to have been strongly influenced by the newly introduced coins of both Beonna and Eadberht.|$|E
5|$|During Richard's {{first years}} as king, {{government}} {{was in the}} hands of a series of councils. Most of the aristocracy preferred this to a regency led by the king's uncle, John of Gaunt, yet Gaunt remained highly influential. The first major challenge of the reign was the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The young king played a major part in the successful suppression of <b>this</b> <b>crisis.</b> In the following years, however, the king's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the Lords Appellant. By 1389 Richard had regained control, and for the next eight years governed in relative harmony with his former opponents.|$|E
5|$|Faced with <b>this</b> <b>crisis,</b> the Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 723–743) took drastic measures: Khurasan was {{separated}} from {{the purview of the}} governor of Iraq and raised to a separate province, under the Jaziran general Ashras ibn Abdallah al-Sulami. Like his predecessor, Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri, Ashras tried to win over the loyalties of the local population and the native, non-Arab converts to Islam (mawali), by addressing some of their grievances on taxation. Soon, however, this policy was reversed—possibly due to pressure from the Caliph himself—and the often brutal measures the Arab tax-gatherers employed to gather the taxes from the mawali and the local landed aristocracy (dihqans) led to a general revolt in Transoxiana. This was made all the more dangerous to the Arabs due to the rebels' call for assistance to the Turgesh ruler, the khagan, who replied by leading his army in person against the Arabs. By the time the khagan entered the field in 728, only Samarkand and the two fortresses of Kamarja and Dabusiyya on the Zarafshan River remained in Arab hands in all of Transoxiana.|$|E
50|$|Another {{opinion on}} The Lord Chandos Letter {{is that it}} is {{evidence}} of an existential <b>crisis.</b> <b>This</b> existential <b>crisis</b> is related to the reconstruction of fin-de-siècle Vienna and the ensuing crisis felt by society. With the transition to an industrial society, forms and manners of expression previously deemed effective were no longer capable of articulating the thoughts and ideas of Viennese society.|$|R

5|$|Tchaikovsky {{lived as}} a {{bachelor}} {{for most of}} his life. In 1868 he met Belgian soprano Désirée Artôt. They became infatuated with each other and were engaged to be married but due to Artôt's refusal to give up the stage or settle in Russia, the relationship ended. Tchaikovsky later claimed she was the only woman he ever loved. In 1877, at the age of 37, he wed a former student, Antonina Miliukova. The marriage was a disaster. Mismatched psychologically and sexually, the couple lived together for only {{two and a half months}} before Tchaikovsky left, overwrought emotionally and suffering from an acute writer's block. Tchaikovsky's family remained supportive of him during <b>this</b> <b>crisis</b> and throughout his life. He was also aided by Nadezhda von Meck, the widow of a railway magnate who had begun contact with him not long before the marriage. As well as an important friend and emotional support, she became his patroness for the next 13 years, which allowed him to focus exclusively on composition. Tchaikovsky's marital debacle may have forced him to face the full truth about his sexuality; he never blamed Antonina for the failure of their marriage.|$|E
5|$|The Ford Model T, {{produced}} from 1908 through 1927, was {{fitted with a}} carburetor with adjustable jetting, allowing use of ethanol, gasoline or kerosene (each by itself), {{or a combination of}} the first two mentioned fuels. Other car manufactures also provided engines for ethanol fuel use. Henry Ford continued to advocate for ethanol as fuel even during the prohibition. However, cheaper oil caused gasoline to prevail, until the 1973 oil crisis resulted in gasoline shortages and awareness on the dangers of oil dependence. <b>This</b> <b>crisis</b> opened a new opportunity for ethanol and other alternative fuels, such as methanol, gaseous fuels such as CNG and LPG, and also hydrogen. Ethanol, methanol and natural gas CNG were the three alternative fuels that received more attention for research and development, and government support.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>crisis</b> had {{its roots}} in the Great Powers' {{competition}} for colonies in the last decades of the 19th century. The German Empire, invigorated by its victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War and by its unification under the Prussian monarchy, had newfound imperial ambitions that stretched beyond Europe. It had shared in the division of Africa, and in the 1880s looked to the Pacific as well. Ships of its Imperial Navy were sent to Apia in Samoa, where German agents had fomented rebellion against the indigenous government. They were countered there by the Asiatic Squadron of the United States Navy. The United States had nearly completed establishing control over its territories on the North American continent, leading American ambitions to stretch beyond its shores. The squadron was at Samoa to assert US interests in the Pacific and to watch the Germans.|$|E

25|$|Aplastic crises are acute worsenings of the patient's {{baseline}} anaemia, producing pale appearance, fast heart rate, and fatigue. <b>This</b> <b>crisis</b> {{is normally}} triggered by parvovirus B19, which directly affects production of {{red blood cells}} by invading the red cell precursors and multiplying in and destroying them.

In normal individuals, this is of little consequence, but the shortened red cell life of SCD patients results in an abrupt, life-threatening situation. Reticulocyte counts drop dramatically during the disease (causing reticulocytopenia), and the rapid turnover of red cells leads to the drop in haemoglobin. <b>This</b> <b>crisis</b> takes 4 days to one week to disappear.
