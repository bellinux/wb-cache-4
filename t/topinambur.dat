5000|$|The name [...] "topinambur", in one account, {{dates from}} 1615, when {{a member of}} the Brazilian coastal tribe called the Tupinambá visited the Vatican {{at the same time that}} a sample of the tuber from Canada was on display there, {{presented}} as a critical food source that helped French Canadian settlers survive the winter. The New World connection resulted in the name <b>topinambur</b> being applied to the tuber, the word now used in French, German, Italian, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "community-supported agriculture" [...] {{was coined}} {{in the northeastern}} United States in the 1980s, {{influenced}} by European biodynamic agriculture ideas formulated by Rudolf Steiner. Two European farmers, Jan Vander Tuin from Switzerland and Trauger Groh from Germany, brought European biodynamic farming ideas to the United States in the mid-1980s. Vander Tuin had co-founded a community-supported agricultural project named <b>Topinambur</b> located near Zurich, Switzerland. Coinage of the term [...] "community-supported agriculture" [...] stems from Vander Tuin. This influence led to the separate and simultaneous creation of two CSAs in 1986. The CSA Garden at Great Barrington was created in Massachusetts by Jan Vander Tuin, Susan Witt, and Robyn Van En. The Temple-Wilton Community Farm was created in New Hampshire by Anthony Graham, Trauger Groh, and Lincoln Geiger.The CSA Garden at Great Barrington remained together until 1990 when many members left to form the Mahaiwe Harvest CSA. One of the original founders, Robyn Van En, became incredibly influential in the CSA movement in America and founded CSA North America in 1992. The Temple-Wilton Community Garden was more successful and still operates as a CSA today. It became an important member of the Wilton community and it receives funding from state, federal, and local sources.|$|E
40|$|One aim {{of a joint}} European {{project called}} DIPP is the {{development}} of lightweight particleboards made from annual and perennial farm plants such as hemp, sunflower, <b>topinambur,</b> maize and miscanthus. These lightweight particleboards are intended to be a possible cheap substitution for traditional wood-based particleboards used in the furniture industry. Therefore the requirements of the EN 312 concerning the moisture-related and mechanical properties of boards for interior use have to be fulfilled. For the production of lightweight boards, light particles with high intra-porosity should be used. In this way some agricultural plants are most suitable for this purpose, because the stalks of sunflower, <b>topinambur</b> and maize are filled with light parenchyma cells...|$|E
40|$|One- and three-layer particleboards with densities varying from 200 kg/m 3 to 650 kg/m 3 are {{produced}} from hemp shives (Cannabis sativa) and stalks of sunflower (Helianthus annuus), <b>topinambur</b> (Helianthus tuberosus), maize (Zea mays) and miscanthus (Miscanthus sinensis gigantheus). The mechanical and physical properties of these boards are presented. Particleboards made from hemp shives, stalks of sunflower and <b>topinambur</b> and of low densities (400 kg/m 3 to 500 kg/m 3) {{were able to}} fulfill the minimum requirements for interal bond strength according to the EN 312 but could not achieve the adequate values of bending strength. Three-layer particleboards were made of <b>topinambur</b> stalks in the core layer and spruce particles in the surface layer, both bonded with UF-resin (12 % solid resin content). With a thickness of 19 mm and a density of 475 kg/m 3 these particleboards have even higher values of internal bond strength as a 22 m industrial standard particleboard made of wood chips with a density of 500 kg/m 3 or as the innovative lightweight boards made with expanded polystyrene in the core layer and a density between 430 kg/m 3 to 460 kg/m 3. The bending strength of these three-layer boards produced in the laboratory matches those of lightweight standard industrial particleboards. For a comparison between boards produced in the laboratory and in the industry, the different conditions of production have to be considered...|$|E

40|$|Particleboards are of {{enormous}} relevance for the European furniture industry. Due {{to the growing}} competition on round wood with the sawmill industry, the producers of groundwood pulp, pulp and pellets and with the thermal utilization of wood the wood-based industries show increasing interest in alternativ raw materials. At the moment, a few companies are producting particleboards made of hemp shives in Germany. The aim of a European joint project was to develop lightwieght flat-press particleboards for the furniture industry made from residues of agricultual plants. The stalks of sunflower (Helianthus annus), <b>topinambur</b> (Helianthus tuberosus), mize (Zea mays) and miscanthus (Miscanthus sinensis giganteus) are characterized by very lightweight pith parenchyma, which makes it particulary suitable {{for the production of}} lightweight particleboards. In contrast to wheat, barley, rye and rape the cultivation of sunflower, <b>topinambur</b> and miscanthus is not widespread in Germany. The cultivated areas used for flax as well as for hemp were reduced drastically during the last years. Further considerations which have {{to be taken into account}} regarding the availability of agricultural raw materials like the harvest per area under cultivation, the crop loss due to harvesting and conditioning as well as miscellaneous types of use will be described...|$|E

In particular, some chemical properties of particles made from stalks of sunflower (Helianthus annuus), <b>topinambur</b> (Helianthus tuberosus), maize (Zea mays) and miscanthus (Miscanthus sinensis gigantheus) as well as hemp shives will be specified...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of two projects {{carried out by}} Fraunhofer WKI as well as research and industrial partners is to develop lightweight particleboards (target density varying from 300 kg/m³ to 500 kg/m³) for the furniture industry. The first project is a joint European project called DIPP (Development of Innovative Particleboard Panels for a better mechanical Performance and a lower environmental impact) in which lightweight particleboards made from annual and perennial plants such as hemp, sunflower, <b>topinambur,</b> maize and miscanthus are produced. As the stalks of sunflower (Helianthus annuus), <b>topinambur</b> (Helianthus tuberosus) and maize (Zea maize) are filled with light parenchyma cells, they are particularly suitable {{for the production of}} lightweight particleboards. Different conventional and natural adhesives like urea- or tannin-formaldehyde resin and PMDI were used, and the properties of the boards produced were compared with reference particleboards made from wood particles. In the second project, funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF), a lightweight particleboard based on foamed adhesives is developed. Within this project, three strategies are pursued: · Foaming of urea-formaldehyde adhesive using air and surfactants; · Mixing of expandable, gas-filled microspheres and polystyrene into UF adhesive; · Use of formaldehyde-free, foam-generating polyurethane adhesives. Physical and mechanical properties of particleboards were tested and presented in detail at the symposium...|$|E
40|$|The aim is {{to develop}} a {{lightweight}} particleboard with a target density between 300 kg/m' and 500 kg/m' for the furniture industry. Basically, there are two different ways to achieve this objective: 1. Use of lightweight raw material 2. Addition of a lightweight material to fill the pore space within the panel. To implement the first approach, a joint European project called DIPP, in which lightweight particleboards are made from annual and perennial plants such as hemp, sunflower, <b>topinambur,</b> maize and miscanthus.

40|$|Helianthus tuberosus is {{economically}} important species. To improve {{characters of}} this energetic plant via genetic modification, production of callus tissue and plant regeneration {{are the first}} steps. A new, potentially energetic cultivar Albik {{was used in this}} study to test callus induction and regeneration. Callus was produced on leaves, petioles, apical meristems and stems from field-harvested plants but was totally non-morphogenic. Its induction started in the cortex and vascular bundles as confirmed by histological analysis. The surface of heterogeneous callus was partially covered with a membranous extracellular matrix surface network visible in scanning and transmission electron microscopies. The results clearly indicate that: (i) the morphogenic capacity of callus in <b>topinambur</b> is genotype dependent, (ii) cv. Albik of H. tuberosus proved recalcitrant in in vitro regeneration, and (iii) extracellular matrix surface network is not a morphogenic marker in this cultivar...|$|E
40|$|In some European countries, {{the wood}} {{quantity}} available for manufacturing of wood-based materials is low. In Germany, the sustainability principle in forestry limits the available wood resource. The increased market demand in raw {{wood of the}} wood-based panel, pulp and paper industries {{as well as the}} increasing energetic use of wood suggest shortages in the supply of wood-working and processing plants. To ensure sufficient raw material availability in the wood-based panel industry, mobilisation of wood from forest which was sparse or not used in the past, secondary raw materials like used wood as well as annual and perennial plants offer alternatives for this purpose. Particleboards are of high importance for the European furniture industry. After in the first instance the assortments with higher compression (flat platen pressed particleboard with target densities of approximately 620 [...] . 680 kg/m 3) preferentially were developed, in order to achieve certain strengths and closed edges. In the recent past the interest in light weight boards increased clearly. The objective of a joint project funded by the European Commission is the development of light weight particleboards made from annual and perennial plants for the furniture industry. The mechanical and hygric properties of particleboards with a density between 200 [...] . 500 kg/m 3 made from annual and perennial plants and with conventional binders or binders based on renewable materials (tannins) will be presented. The internal bond strength of particleboards made from hemp shives, sunflower and <b>topinambur</b> stalks respectively with a density of 400 [...] . 500 kg/m 3 was sufficient, but the bending strength of the boards was low...|$|E
