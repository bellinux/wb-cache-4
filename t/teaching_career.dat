40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{there have been a}} number of {{approaches}} for recruiting minorities to enter <b>teaching</b> <b>careers.</b> One such program has been that of the Consortium for Minorities in <b>Teaching</b> <b>Careers</b> (CMTC). CMTC uses several replicable models to encourage minority high school students' interest in <b>teaching</b> <b>careers.</b> At all CMTC sites, the following components are found: (1) mentoring; (2) peer support; and (3) value change. Some sites also use training and practice to provide opportunities for students. The University of Iowa has been responsible for evaluating CMTC programs. A nonproportional stratified sampling procedure was used in 1995 and 1996 to select program participants from seven sites. A random sample of 139 participants was drawn, and 76 were interviewed either as high school or college students, or as high school graduates who were not going to college. Average participants in CMTC programs were not students who would normally go to college or even necessarily finish high school. Many participated in th...|$|R

5|$|Soviet chemist D. K. Dobroserdov was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to claim to have found eka-caesium, or francium. In 1925, he observed weak radioactivity {{in a sample of}} potassium, another alkali metal, and incorrectly concluded that eka-caesium was contaminating the sample (the radioactivity from the sample was from the naturally occurring potassium radioisotope, potassium-40). He then published a thesis on his predictions of the properties of eka-caesium, in which he named the element russium after his home country. Shortly thereafter, Dobroserdov began to focus on his <b>teaching</b> <b>career</b> at the Polytechnic Institute of Odessa, and he did not pursue the element further.|$|E

5|$|From Tartus, al-Qassam {{traveled}} to Beirut by boat {{and then to}} Haifa, then under the British Mandate, where his wife and daughters later joined him. During the early 1920s, al-Qassam taught at the Madrasa Islamiya, an Islamic educational institution with many schools in Haifa and its periphery. It {{was funded by the}} Jamiat Islamiya, a waqf (religious endowments) administered by prominent Muslims from the city. Unlike other Muslim scholars, al-Qassam made himself easily accessible to the public and often arrived late to teach his classes because he was frequently stopped by passersby for advice. He resigned from his <b>teaching</b> <b>career</b> due to the school's insistence that he maintain consistent hours. As part of his Islamic revivalist teaching, he denounced and discouraged some local Palestinian traditions, including unorthodox funeral rituals, mothers' visitation to the al-Khidr shrine near Mount Carmel to give thanks for their children's well-being or achievements and tribal dances around religious sites, as superstitious innovations to Islam.|$|E
