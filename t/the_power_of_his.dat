5|$|In the 20th century Æthelwulf's {{reputation}} among historians was poor: he {{was seen}} as excessively pious and impractical, and his pilgrimage {{was viewed as a}} desertion of his duties. Historians in the 21st century see him very differently, as a king who consolidated and extended <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dynasty, commanded respect on the continent, and dealt more effectively than most of his contemporaries with Viking attacks. He is {{regarded as one of the}} most successful West Saxon kings, who laid the foundations for the success of his son, Alfred the Great.|$|E
5|$|The {{apex of the}} Counter-Reformation {{activity}} {{had fallen}} on {{the turn of the}} 17th century, the earlier years of the reign of Sigismund III Vasa (Zygmunt III Waza), who in cooperation with the Jesuits and some other Church circles attempted to strengthen <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> monarchy. The King tried to limit access to higher offices to Catholics. Anti-Protestant riots took place in some cities. During the Sandomierz Rebellion of 1606 the Protestants supported the anti-King opposition in large numbers. Nevertheless, the massive wave of szlachta's return to Catholicism could not have been stopped.|$|E
5|$|After Lukashenko {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} in 1994, he stated his intention to amend the recently passed Constitution. The amendments, according to Lukashenko, would expand <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> office, marking {{a turning point in}} post-Soviet era politics in Belarus. A May 1995 national referendum was {{the first step in the}} amendment process. Out of the four questions, one asked if the president could disband parliament if the members violate national law. The vote, which several Supreme Soviet deputies protested, resulted in 77% in favor of the provision regarding the dismissal of the legislature by the president. Other questions on the ballot, such as the national flag and national emblem, didn't affect the Constitution as a whole, but their status has been decided by the Constitution. Two years later, Lukashenko scheduled the first referendum that would potentially alter the Constitution. The last referendum on the Constitution occurred in 2004, also scheduled by Lukashenko.|$|E

5|$|Hull {{accepted}} {{a scholarship to}} play for the University of Minnesota-Duluth (UMD), and in 1984–85, scored 32 goals as a freshman. <b>The</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shot terrorized opposition goaltenders. He was awarded the Jerry Chumola Award as the school's rookie of the year and received similar honors from the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). His coaches at Minnesota-Duluth impressed on Hull the need to improve his skating, and in 1985–86, he broke the school record of 49 goals in one season, reaching 52 for the campaign. Hull was named the WCHA first team all-star at right wing and was a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award as the top player in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).|$|E
5|$|In 1075, three earls rebelled, {{for reasons}} unknown, and sought {{aid from the}} King of Denmark, Sweyn II Estridsson, who had a distant claim to the English throne. Among the rebels was Roger de Breteuil, the Earl of Hereford, whose lands neighboured those of Urse. Along with Bishop Wulfstan of Worcester, Abbot Æthelwig of Evesham, and Walter de Lacy, Urse {{prevented}} de Breteuil from crossing the River Severn. Urse's actions kept the rebels from seizing control of the Severn Valley and joining up with the other English rebels, Waltheof, the Earl of Northumbria, and Ralph de Gael, the Earl of Norfolk. Urse and the magnates fighting alongside him, {{in addition to their}} obvious desire to suppress rebellion, had an interest in defeating de Breteuil, as he was the most powerful lord in the area. De Breteuil was caught, tried, and imprisoned for life, increasing <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rivals.|$|E
5|$|Nighttime levels feature slower-paced, action-oriented levels, {{in which}} Sonic {{transforms}} into the Werehog, a beast form that has great strength and stretchable arms. Gameplay here sees the player {{use a variety}} of melee and combo attacks to defeat large numbers of enemies, collect items, and move items around to advance through the level, and use his stretchable arms to cling to distant objects; simple puzzle elements are also featured. Collecting rings in these levels replenishes the Werehog's health, while a special move, Unleashed Mode, allows the Werehog to channel his energy into increasing <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> attacks for a short time. Nighttime levels are adjusted in the Wii version to allow greater use of the Wii Remote, such that players may control the arms of the Werehog by using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk in order to grab onto objects and proceed in the levels. The Wii version of the game also expands upon the ratio of nighttime levels to daytime, with more than three times as many nighttime levels (twenty-five in all). After nighttime levels are completed, Dark Gaia Points are gained, allowing access to bonus moves.|$|E

5|$|People who stutter include British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, orator Demosthenes, King George VI, actor James Earl Jones, {{and country}} singer Mel Tillis. Churchill, whose stutter was {{particularly}} apparent to 1920s writers, {{was one of}} the 30% of stutterers who have an associated speech disorder—a lisp in his case—yet led his nation through World War II. Demosthenes stammered and was inarticulate as a youth, yet, through dedicated practice, using methods such as placing pebbles in his mouth, became a great orator of Ancient Greece. King George VI hired speech therapist Lionel Logue to enable him to speak to his Empire, and Logue effectively helped him accomplish this goal. This training and its results are the focus of the 2010 film The King's Speech. James Earl Jones has stated he was mute for many years of his youth yet he became an actor noted for <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice. Mel Tillis stutters when talking but not when singing. Many people had their speech impediment only as a child and have overcome their condition.|$|E
25|$|All the {{characters}} immediately feel awe for Aslan. Jadis expresses this as fear and hatred, and before fleeing she assaults Aslan {{with an iron}} bar that she tore from a lamp-post in London. Aslan is unperturbed and continues calling plants and animals into existence. <b>The</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> song {{is so great that}} even the iron bar, dropped on fertile earth, grows into a functioning lamp post, and toffees sprout into fruit trees. Aslan claims <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> song will last for a few days.|$|E
25|$|When Digory, Polly, Jadis of Charn, Uncle Andrew, the Cabby and Strawberry {{inadvertently}} enter a {{new world}} using magic rings, they find it an empty void. Aslan appears, and through <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> singing, calls the world of Narnia into existence.|$|E

25|$|Dutugamunu (Sinhala: දුටුගැමුණු Duṭugämuṇu), {{also known}} as Dutthagamani duṭṭhagāmaṇī and Gāmaṇī Abhaya ("fearless Gamini"), was a Sinhalese king of Sri Lanka who reigned from 161 BC to 137 BC. He is renowned for {{defeating}} and overthrowing Elara, the usurping Tamil prince from the Chola Kingdom, who had invaded the Kingdom of Rajarata in 205 BC. Dutugamunu also expanded and beautified the city of Anuradhapura and projected <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> native Rajarata region across the island of Sri Lanka.|$|E
25|$|Like his birthmark, his deck {{features}} Monkey monsters, {{including the}} Dark Synchro Monster Zeman the Ape King, which focuses around increasing <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> monsters in play through {{the number of}} monsters in his graveyard.

25|$|The same {{reputation}} which Baxter {{had obtained}} in the country he secured in London. <b>The</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> preaching was universally felt, and his capacity for business placed him {{at the head of}} his party. He had been made a king's chaplain, and was offered the Bishopric of Hereford, but he could not accept the offer without assenting to things as they were. After his refusal, he was not allowed, even before the passing of the Act of Uniformity, to be a curate in Kidderminster, and Bishop George Morley prohibited him from preaching in the Diocese of Worcester.|$|E

25|$|It is a {{rule that}} all animals except men and tigers are allowed to be hunted. According to tradition, only one {{individual}} is allowed to hunt the tiger on an auspicious day, upon the initiation period of the shamans, which can be likened a trial of passage. Upon hunting the tiger, the jawbone, along with all its teeth, {{is used as a}} magic weapon. This is believed that its power will enable the tigers to evoke <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> guiding spirit of the ancestral tiger, who will accompany and protect the boy along his way.|$|E
25|$|Muawiyah governed the {{geographically}} {{and politically}} disparate caliphate, which now spread from north Africa {{in the west}} to Afghanistan in the east, by strengthening <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> allies in the newly conquered territories. Prominent positions in the emerging governmental structures were held by Christians, some of whom belonged to families that had served in Byzantine governments. The employment of Christians was part of a broader policy of religious tolerance that was necessitated by the presence of large Christian populations in the conquered provinces, especially in Syria itself. This policy also boosted his popularity and solidified Syria as his power base.|$|E
25|$|Using <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> new position, Welsh {{was able}} to {{maneuver}} himself into being a candidate for governor again at the 1960 state convention. This time his popularity had risen to such a height that he easily overcame his opposition to secure the nomination. In the general election, he faced Lieutenant Governor Crawford F. Parker, the Republican nominee. The campaign focused primarily on the looming budget deficit and secondarily on the civil rights issues being debated nationally. Although his party lost Indiana in the presidential election, Welsh won a narrow victory at the polls, winning by about 23,000 votes out of 2.1 million cast.|$|E
50|$|After being {{swallowed}} by the soil of Krakoa, he absorbed <b>the</b> <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teammates Sway, Darwin, and Petra, giving him their <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> time manipulation, physical adaptation, and earth manipulation respectively.

50|$|William Pitt the Younger was a {{powerful}} prime minister who consolidated <b>the</b> <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> office. Though he was sometimes opposed by members <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Cabinet, he helped define {{the role of the}} Prime Minister as the supervisor and co-ordinator of the various Government departments. After his death the conservatives embraced him as a great patriotic hero.|$|R
25|$|Cuvier {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> principle came {{in part from}} its ability {{to aid in the}} reconstruction of fossils. In most cases, fossils of quadrupeds were not found as complete, assembled skeletons, but rather as scattered pieces that needed to be put together by anatomists. To make matters worse, deposits often contained the fossilized remains of several species of animals mixed together. Anatomists reassembling these skeletons ran the risk of combining remains of different species, producing imaginary composite species. However, by examining the functional purpose of each bone and applying the principle of correlation of parts, Cuvier {{believed that}} this problem could be avoided.|$|E
25|$|As a young adult, Pootie Tang {{rises to}} fame and becomes {{well known for}} a variety of reasons. He sings in nightclubs, stars in public service {{announcements}} for children, produces top-of-the-charts music hits, and generally defeats wrongdoers with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> belt. Dick Lecter, the CEO of multi-industrial conglomerate LecterCorp, learns of Pootie Tang's positive influence on society — and his negative influence on LecterCorp's bottom line. After his henchmen and a vile villain named Dirty Dee are sent away by Pootie's friends, Lecter encourages his right-hand lady, Ireenie, to seduce Pootie Tang into signing an agreement with LecterCorp that would stop Pootie Tang's influence on America's children.|$|E
25|$|He had {{to leave}} Uganda hastily on the {{approach}} of an expedition commanded by Frederick Lugard, {{the representative of the}} Imperial British East Africa Company. On reaching Zanzibar he learned that his efforts were useless, as on 1 July 1890 the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty between Germany and the UK had been signed, whereby Uganda was left as an area of British influence and Peters' agreement with Mwanga became null and void. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> company had ended when the coastal population rebelled in the Abushiri Revolt against the implementation of the lease agreement between the Sultan and the Germans. The German government had to intervene by sending troops commanded by Hermann Wissmann, ended the insurrection and assumed ownership of the company's possessions as a colony.|$|E
60|$|It may be {{that the}} captain's too {{youthful}} spirit spurned assistance, or that he had miscalculated <b>the</b> <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> too ancient body, for at the moment his foot slipped while as yet <b>his</b> hold <b>of</b> the man-ropes was not secure, and he fell with a lion-like roar that might have shamed the stoutest king of the African forests.|$|R
60|$|This {{outbreak}} against Alexander's {{authority was}} in a great measure {{the work of the}} great orator Demosthenes, who spared no exertions to arouse the southern states of Greece to resist Alexander's dominion. He especially exerted all <b>the</b> <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> eloquence in Athens in the endeavor to bring over the Athenians to take sides against Alexander.|$|R
5000|$|Reed Richards' {{strength}} comes {{more from}} <b>the</b> <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mind than <b>the</b> <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body; indeed, {{he once told}} Spider-Man that he considers his stretching powers to be expendable compared to his intellect. Some stories have implied that Reed's intellect may have been boosted by his powers, as he once visited an alternate universe where his other self-had never been exposed to cosmic rays and was notably less intelligent than him, though purely human versions of Reed that are as or even more intelligent than himself have been shown, particularly among the Council of Reeds. Tony Stark has commented that Reed's ability to make his brain physically larger (via his elastic powers) gives him an advantage, though {{this seems to be}} meant more as a joke. That said, scenes from the same issue show Reed [...] "inflating" [...] his skull as he calculates <b>the</b> <b>power</b> output <b>of</b> Tony's Repulsor-battery heart implant.|$|R
