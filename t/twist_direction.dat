Above all, the “technological conditions of thespun yarn production” means the turning moment of the thread. A twisted thread will alwaystry to twist when it hangs freely between two fixed points {{in the form of a}} loop. In doing this, it gives up a part of its original twist which becomes spirals whose twisting direction is opposite to the original <b>twist</b> <b>direction.</b> This development of twist in the opposite direction occurs as the twisted yarn attempts to reach equilibrium.|$|E
5000|$|Yarn is {{composed}} of twisted strands of fiber, which are known as plies when grouped together. These strands of yarn are twisted together (plied) {{in the opposite direction}} to make a thicker yarn. Depending on the direction of this final twist, the yarn will have either s&#8209;twist (the threads appear to go [...] "up" [...] to the left) or z&#8209;twist (to the right). For a single ply yarn, the direction of the final twist is the same as its original twist. The <b>twist</b> <b>direction</b> of yarn can affect the final properties of the fabric, and combined use of the two twist directions can nullify skewing in knitted fabric.|$|E

50|$|Twisting in the {{opposite}} direction is due to the tensions resulting from the yarn twisting that Mueller indicated in the diagram of tension and pressure. The total tension acting against the twisting is increased in relation to increasedtwisting due to the increasing tension and pressure of the bundle of fibres in the yarn. It may become so strong that the thread core buckles when it can no longer withstand the compressive strains. The yarn curls, meaning that the yarn tries to reach a state of equilibrium in which twists in {{the opposite}} direction from the original <b>twist</b> <b>direction</b> balance the yarn’s torque.These twists are also called negative twists. In this state of equilibrium, the inner torsional tensions cancel each other out. The thread always buckles at a spot where the cross section is small due to the unevenness of the thread. During the spinning process this spot took up more twists and is therefore subjected to higher inner tensions, which ultimately break the thread core. Although thicker yarns are less twisted than fine ones, the inner tension rises opposite to the yarn size. Smaller yarn is more weakened by steaming. Further positive aspects of steaming are the reduction of curling and, at the same time, the setting of the physical properties of closeness and extension imparted to the yarn by twisting.|$|E

The findings were as follows: The spinnability of the fiber sample blended with polyester yielded yarn count of 21. 54 Ne; the physical property test of the polyester/Sanseviera yarns in the <b>twist</b> <b>direction</b> of the yarn was Z twist with 668 twist count per meter (tpm); the yarn properties of the polyester/Sanseviera yarn possessed acceptable properties comparable to polyester/pineapple and polyester/water hyacinth which was successfully used for clothing and apparels. The researchers concluded that the blended yarn exhibited yarn realization with a minimum ends down; the blended yarn is strong due to higher number of twist per meter; the blended yarn possessed acceptable properties comparable to polyester/pineapple and polyester/water hyacinth which was successfully used for clothing and apparels. The researchers recommend that other natural fibers be blended with Sanseviera cylindrica; that different degumming treatments be used to give the most satisfactory performance during spinning; that weaving of yarns be undertaken to assess the economic viability of Sanseviera cylindrica for textile material...|$|E

Twenty two subjects {{participated in the study}} that comprised two parts, the first of which involved measurement of maximum forearm torque in both <b>twisting</b> <b>directions</b> at five forearm angles including neutral. This was followed by endurance tests at 50 % MVC in both directions. The second part of the study involved subjects performing five minute long intermittent isometric torque exercises at 20 % MVC in both directions at eleven forearm angles. Regression equations were developed that accurately predict torques as a function of forearm angle expressed as a percentage of maximum motion. Analysis of the discomfort data for the intermittent isometric torque exertions indicated that both forearm angle and <b>twisting</b> <b>direction</b> significantly affected forearm discomfort (p< 0. 001). A significant two-way interaction (p< 0. 01) was identified between forearm angle and direction for supine forearm angles only. The results provide important strength and discomfort models for the design of tasks involving static or repetitive forearm twisting. Such tasks have a strong association with forearm injuries including lateral and medial epicondylitis. These results provide needed data on the risk factors associated with these injuries so they can be prevented. ACCEPTEDpeer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The main {{topics of}} this thesis {{comprise}} the following questions: - Is the crossply strength predictable from {{the strength of}} UD-composites or are there interactions between the layers. - What is {{the influence of the}} matrix. For comparison the ductile thermoplastic Polyetheretherketone, a rigid and a toughened epoxy resin were applied as matrices. Therefore the static and fatigue strength has been determined for [0 / 90]- and [#+-# 45]-crossply composites under tensile and shear loading at 77 K. Generally, the strength calculated from a fracture criterion and the observed strength do not coincide. If the bond between the layers is strong, the layers are no more independent and interactions between the layers could occur. These interactions could reduce the strength in certain cases or increase it because of the constraint by neihgbouring layers. Only if delaminations occur, the calculated and the observed strengths coincide. The strength of [#+-# 45]-composites under shear loading is very sensitive to the <b>twist</b> <b>direction</b> related to the layup. A premature failure could occur because of buckling of fibres on the outer or inner surface of the torsion tube. With a certain layup this premature failure can be prevented for at least one <b>twist</b> <b>direction.</b> In this case the composite strength is determined by the compressive strength which for carbon fibre composites is lower than the tensile strength.

50|$|In the Standard Model of {{particle}} physics, each {{different kind of}} elementary particle has four different charges, corresponding to <b>twists</b> along <b>directions</b> of a four-dimensional maximal torus in the twelve-dimensional Standard Model Lie group, SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1). The two strong “color” charges, g3 and g8, correspond to <b>twists</b> along <b>directions</b> in the two-dimensional maximal torus of the eight-dimensional SU(3) Lie group of the strong interaction. The weak isospin, T3 (or W), and weak hypercharge, YW (or Y), correspond to <b>twists</b> along <b>directions</b> in the two-dimensional maximal torus of the four-dimensional SU(2)×U(1) Lie group of the electroweak interaction, with W and Y combining as electric charge, Q. Whenever an interaction occurs between elementary particles, with two coming together and becoming a third, or one particle becoming two, each type of charge must be conserved. For example, a red up quark, having charges (g3, g8, W, Y) can interact with a weak boson, W−, having charges (g3 = 0, g8 = 0, W = −1, Y = 0), to produce a red down quark, having charges (g3 , g8, W, Y). The complete pattern of all Standard Model particle charges in four dimensions may be projected down to two dimensions and plotted in a charge diagram.|$|R

Optical rotation may potentially be applied in noise-cancelling nondestructive photoswiches. The conformations were studied by experimental and theoretical methods.
