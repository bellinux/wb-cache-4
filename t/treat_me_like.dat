Anderson of Slate wrote that [...] "Title" [...] perpetuated a {{retrograde}} belief about relationships and deemed Trainor a poor role model, and opined, [...] "Once again she is sending the message that a woman's worth is defined by men".

500|$|Mantle is {{best known}} for his long stint as general surgeon Dr Mike Barratt in 85 episodes of the TV series Casualty from October 1992 to November 1996, and 32 episodes of Holby City between 1999 and 2001. He {{previously}} appeared in Casualty as the brother of a patient in 1988. Mantle received much acclaim for his role and was one of the show's most popular characters. He was praised for being entirely convincing as a hospital consultant and very dominant and authoritative in his role, [...] "shouting orders in incomprehensible hospital-speak." [...] Daily Mirror described him as a [...] "heart-throb consultant" [...] and said that the role brought him [...] "an army of female fans". A 2001 poll by the Scottish Sunday Mail voted him 7th on a list of Top [...] "10 heart-throb docs on the box" [...] in a list which included the likes of George Clooney and Goran Višnjić. Mantle has said that during his role as the doctor he received a lot of fan mail, some of which were medically related and asking for his advice, believing him to be a real doctor, but professed that he couldn't even stand the sight of real blood. He has said, [...] "It's funny because people always <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a doctor. Not a day goes by without someone coming up to me and asking me for advice." [...] In 1996, he turned down an offer of £250,000 to continue playing the character, and last appeared in Casualty in November 1996. He said of his departure: ...|$|E

His song [...] "Bikeage" [...] is about [...] "a group of girls who were sort of turning into sluts", while [...] "Jean Is Dead" [...] deals with [...] "a girl who was not stable, but I had really not known." [...] Fishing was a favorite hobby of Stevenson's; [...] "Catalina" [...] describes a fishing trip to Santa Catalina Island, California. Guitarist Frank Navetta's song [...] "I'm Not a Loser" [...] expressed resentment and envy toward those he viewed as more attractive and successful, while [...] "Parents" [...] stemmed from his own familial discord, with lyrics such as [...] "They don't even know I'm a boy / They <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a toy / But little do they know / That one day I'll explode".|$|E
2500|$|In 211, Cao Cao sent Zhong Yao and Xiahou Yuan to lead an army {{to attack}} Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. They {{were due to}} pass through the Guanzhong region along the way. Ma Chao {{suspected}} that Cao Cao was planning to attack him, so he contacted Han Sui to form an alliance. He told Han Sui, [...] "Previously, Zhong Yao ordered me to harm you. Now, I know that the people from Guandong (east of Tong Pass) cannot be trusted. Now, I abandon my father, and I'm willing to acknowledge you as my father. You should also abandon your son, and <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> your son." [...] Han Sui's subordinate, Yan Xing, urged his superior not to cooperate with Ma Chao but Han still agreed to the alliance. Ma Chao also contacted Yang Qiu, Li Kan (李堪), Cheng Yi (成宜), Hou Xuan (侯選), Cheng Yin (程銀), Zhang Heng (張橫), Liang Xing (梁興), Ma Wan (馬玩) and others, and they formed a 100,000 strong coalition army to attack Tong Pass (present-day Tongguan County, Shaanxi).
