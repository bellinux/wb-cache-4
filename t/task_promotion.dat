In the sequential choices for sequential consumption condition (consumers buy one item at a time for each consumption occasion), promotion-focused consumers tend to select {{a greater variety of}} items (a higher extent of variety-seeking) than prevention-focused consumers. In contrast, in the simultaneous choices for sequential consumption condition (consumers buy several items at a time for each following consumption occasion), prevention-focused consumers tend to select a greater variety of items (a higher extent of variety-seeking) than promotion-focused consumers.

The promotion decision should be based much more on the outcome in a more uncertain task. If employees are heterogeneous in their ability to undertake a task, then the outcome of an ability-dependent task should be relied upon more in the promotion decision than the outcome of a simple task. ...|$|R

Translations {{are important because}} children display a strongly differentiated competence in understanding and speaking English as a lingua franca. In villages, adults’ translations are frequently instrumental to the achievement of assigned <b>tasks,</b> while <b>promotion</b> of children’s active participation is scarce. Consequently, translations are often adults’ disempowering monologues and, during their translation activity, adults tend to strategically reduce renditions of translated turns and to avoid possible conflicts. Nevertheless, during the translation activity, dyadic interactions in the first language {{may be useful in}} promoting children’s active participation, and adults may also highlight the possibility to change decisions and reopen discussions. Finally, dialogic mediation seems to be more likely in adolescents’ occasional translations for their mates in summer camps...|$|R

Based on the interview that has been conducted to this project, it is found that lecturer are not clear on criteria that need to be fulfilled in order to obtain a grade promotions. They still need to ask a help from other lecturer about to get a grade promotion. The aim of the project is to develop the Grade <b>Promotions</b> <b>Task</b> Recommendations System for UiTM lecturers. The objectives of the project is to design the Grade <b>Promotions</b> <b>Task</b> Recommendations, to develop the system prototype in the web based system for Windows platform and to test the functionality of the system prototype. Currently the system {{is developed}} for the UiTM lecturer. The project is developed by using the fuzzy logic technique and there are about 20 rules that is used in this project. The scopes of the project covers the grade position of UiTM lecturer from DM 45 to VK 7. The methodology that is used in this project is prototyping methodology. Its consists only one iteration due to the limitation of time and the output will be high-fidelity which means can function. The data finding is from conducting literature review and interviews. There are 3 interviews that is conducted {{in order to get the}} data to develop this system. However, this system still need the improvement and enhancement to make its more perform better. The main suggestion for the future work of this project is to make it available in mobile platform. This is because currently the system is only available in web platform The other minor suggestion for the future work is explained well in the chapter 7 in the subtopic Recommendation of Future Works...|$|R

40|$|Effective open {{relationships}} with employees can help foreign managers rely upon and utilize the local {{knowledge of their}} employees. One hundred and sixty-three Chinese employees from various industries in China were surveyed on their relationships (leadership–member relationship and personal guanxi) with American and Chinese managers, their constructive controversy, that is, their constructive controversy with them, and the job assignments and promotions received from their managers. Results support the hypotheses that quality leader–member relationship and personal guanxi promoted their constructive controversy, which in turn facilitated employees receiving challenging jobs and promotions. Results suggest that leader–member relationship and Chinese value of guanxi may be important for enhancing their constructive controversy; this kind of open dialogue can be a foundation upon which American managers can develop the confidence to give their Chinese employees challenging <b>tasks</b> and <b>promotions.</b> Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007 Guanxi, Leader–member relationships, Open-minded dialogue,...|$|R

The aim of this thesis is to find out both what the contribution of the NGO People in Need to the field of human rights is and what methods are put in use within their operations. The theoretical part firstly deals with non-governmental organizations from a generic point of view in order to further tackle those NGOs that are active in the field of human rights. The empirical part of this thesis is specifically focused on the case of the non-governmental organization People in Need, bringing forward its overall activity and effect especially within the <b>task</b> of <b>promotion</b> of human rights. The methods used in this field are defined and their application is then monitored in two concrete case studies of Burma and Cuba. In connection to the support provided to those countries, this thesis further explores the ways of spreading awareness of such topic onto the Czech civil society...|$|R

The main <b>task</b> of <b>promotion</b> is to improve sale with higher profit than it would be achieved without it. Thus the critical question is what the possibility of measurement of promotion influence on sale and profit is? As a matter of fact by establishing the influence in economic sense it is possible to define specific efficiency of promotion which is manifested in relation of profit of sale products and services towards expenditures for promotion of the same products and services. To achieve established goals tourist agency must also develop conception of marketing, giving importance to system of promotion, in order to ensure stable position at tourist market and from year to year increase profits from sale...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} {{the choice of}} performance measures in promotion decisions. In particular, we examine {{the extent to which}} managers incorporate different performance measures for different types of job assignment. Based on a simple theoretical framework, we predict that, in making promotion decisions, the weight on current job performance decreases with increases in the change in <b>tasks</b> upon <b>promotion,</b> while the weight on subjective assessments of ability increases. This result basically follows from the premise that, with increased changes in tasks between hierarchical levels, the ability to master the current job says little about the ability needed in the next job, which makes current job performance less informative and increases the emphasis on subjective assessments. Using panel data of a retail bank, we find that individual managers behave according to our predictions. By examining the choice of performance measures in promotion decisions, we are able to provide unique insights into the incentive versus sorting roles of promotions, which has important implications for performance measurement and incentive system desig...|$|R
