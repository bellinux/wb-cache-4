6000|$|We visited Palung twice, chiefly {{in hopes}} that Dr. Campbell might see the {{magnificent}} prospect of Kinchinjhow from its plains: {{the first time we}} gained little beyond a ducking, but on the second (October the 15th) the view was superb; and I likewise caught a glimpse of Kinchinjunga from the neighbouring heights, bearing south 60 degrees west and distant forty miles. I also measured barometrically the elevation at the great chait on the plains, and found it 15,620 feet, and by carefully boiled thermometers, 15,283, on the 13th October, and 15,566 on the 15th: <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>being</b> <b>due</b> to the higher temperature on the latter day, and to a rise of 0.3 degree on both boiling-point thermometers above what the same instruments stood at on the 13th. The elevation of Tungu from the October barometrical observations was only seven feet higher than that given by those of July; the respective heights being 12,766 feet in July, and 12,773 in October.* [The elevation of Tungu by boiling-point was 12,650 feet by a set of July observations, 12,818 by a set taken on the 11th of October, and 12,544 by a set on the 14th of October: the discrepancies were partly due to the temperature corrections, but mainly to the readings of the thermometers, which were-- July 28, sunset 189.5, air 47.3 degrees, elev. 12,650 Oct. 11, noon [...] 189.5, air 37.6 degrees, elev. 12,818 Oct. 14, sunset 190.1, air 45.3 degrees, elev. 12,544] The mean temperature had fallen from 50 degrees in July to 41 degrees, and that of the sunk thermometer from 57 degrees to 51.4 degrees. The mean range in July was 23.3 degrees, and in October 13.8 degrees; the weather during the latter period being, however, uniformly cold and misty, this was much below the mean monthly range, which probably exceeds 30 degrees. Much more rain fell in October at Tungu than at Dorjiling, which is the opposite to what occurs during the rainy season.|$|E

50|$|Using the {{information}} in Kings and Chronicles, Edwin Thiele has calculated the dates of the reigns of the kings of Judah from {{the division of the}} kingdom, which he calculates to have been in 931-930 BC. Thiele noticed that for the first seven kings of Israel (ignoring Zimri's inconsequential seven-day reign), the synchronisms to Judean kings fell progressively behind by one year for each king. Thiele saw this as evidence that the northern kingdom was measuring the years by a non-accession system (first partial year of reign was counted as year one), whereas the southern kingdom was using the accession method (it was counted as year zero). Also he concluded that the calendars for reckoning the years of kings in Judah and Israel were offset by six months, that of Judah starting in Tishri (in the fall) and that of Israel in Nisan (in the spring). This is the conclusion from cross-synchronizations between the two kingdoms which often allows the narrowing of the beginning and/or ending dates of a king to within a six-month range, indicating <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>being</b> <b>due</b> to the calendar starting date. Once these were understood, the various reign lengths and cross-synchronisms for these kings was worked out, and the sum of reigns for both kingdoms produced 931/930 BC for the division of the kingdom when working backwards from the Battle of Qarqar in 853 BC.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{structure}} of the 1402 bp repeat unit of bovine satellite 1. 715 has been determined using a dimer inserted at the SalI site of plasmid pBR 322 and cloned in E. coli. In contrast with bovine satellites 1. 706, 1. 720 b and 1. 711 a, the 1. 715 satellite has a complex sequence with no obvious internal short prototype repeat. The sequence consists however of repeats ranging in length from 6 to 13 nucleotides. In addition, the hexanucleotide, AGATGA, present in the prototype sequences of satellites 1. 706, 1. 720 b and 1. 711 a, is found in satellite 1. 715 in repeats as long as, or longer than, 8 nucleotides, establishing a homology link among those satellites {{on one hand and}} satellite 1. 715 (and the related satellite 1. 711 b) on the other.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dysconnectivity {{theories}} of schizophrenia {{would suggest that}} the connectivity of the cerebellum is impaired and that the impairment may be restricted to certain tracts. Attempts to examine the structural connectivity of the cerebellum using diffusion tensor imaging have yielded conflicting results. However, previous studies have employed region-of-interest approaches or have used small or unmatched samples, with a consequent risk of type II error. METHODS: We conducted an appropriately powered case-control study of 33 patients with schizophrenia and 33 matched healthy control subjects. We used tractography to dissect the four white matter tracts of the cerebellum and measured fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) over each tract for each subject. RESULTS: Repeated-measures analysis of variance found that FA was lower in the schizophrenia group compared with the control group, but there were no tract-specific <b>differences</b> between <b>the</b> groups. Mean diffusivity did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Though structural connectivity is impaired in the cerebellum, it is not local to any particular tract but appears to have a wider, possibly global, distribution. Reduced fractional anisotropy with normal MD would point to <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>being</b> <b>due</b> to disordered neuronal architecture rather than disordered myelination...|$|R

Pen n 18 was then cloned and the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence. The cDNA encoded a 494 amino acid protein, considerably larger than mature Pen n 18, <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>being</b> <b>due</b> to <b>the</b> N- and C-terminal prosequences.

On immunoblots, the purified recombinant protein specifically bound IgE from mould-allergic patients, and cross-inhibition assays demonstrated the presence of common IgE-binding epitopes on Pen n 18 and a major allergen of P. citrinum, Pen c 18. When mapping of the allergenic epitopes was performed, at least nine different linear IgE-binding epitopes, located throughout the Pen n 18 protein, were identified. Of these, peptide C 12, located in the N-terminal region of the molecule, was recognized by serum from 75 % of the patients tested and therefore appears to be an immunodominant IgE-binding epitope...|$|R
40|$|In recent optical {{experiments}} for YH 3, a large {{band gap}} of almost 3 eV has been observed. In contrast, calculations within the local density approximation (LDA) {{result in a}} semimetallic band structure with a band overlap near the Fermi level of more than 1 eV. This unusually large discrepancy between the LDA results and experiment has led to suggestions that strong local correlation effects, {{similar to those found}} in transition metal oxides, are important in YH 3. Here we conclude from parameter-free quasi-particle calculations within the GW approximation that YH 3 is essentially a conventional semiconductor. We argue that the experimental results can be fully understood in band structure terms without invoking strong local correlations. The unusually large error in the band structure made by LDA is traced to its poor description of the electronic structure of the hydrogen atom. Our GW results predict a fundamental band gap of only 1 eV and an optical gap of 2. 6 eV, <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>being</b> <b>due</b> to vanishing matrix elements for optical transitions at lower energies.

The biomass gasification technology, which was selected for integration with the SOFC stacks, was the air-blown downdraught gasifier, because of its simplicity and relative cheapness. Willow and miscanthus were taken as the biomass fuels for the power plants. In addition, the sensitivity of the COE to variations in the fuel cost, the fuel cell cost, the fuel cell lifetime, and the waste heat selling price were examined and compared. From the ECLIPSE simulations, the efficiencies of both the HT and IT 250 kWe systems were found to be around 39 % when willow was used as fuel and around 38 % with miscanthus, <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>being</b> <b>due</b> to moisture content, rather than any intrinsic property of the biomass.

Several different heat exchange configurations may be utilised in this context, but for those (âstanding columnâ and âopen loopâ arrangements) where mine water reinjection is practised, the rate of heat transfer between mine walls and mine water is a critical process to quantify. The two most commonly-used analytical solutions to this problem have been applied to the same baseline scenario, exploring and comparing their sensitivity, strengths, weaknesses and areas of application.

Simple thermal evolution models, based on subsolidus whole mantle convection, indicate that {{this may not be the}} case. These models have been constructed assuming an initially hot state, but with a wide variety of choices for the parameters characterizing the rheology and convective vigor. All models are constrained to be consistent with present-day surface heat fluxes, and many of the terrestrial models are consistent with the mantle viscosities indicated by post-glacial rebound. For the earth the acceptable models give a radiogenic heat production that is only 65 â 85 % of the surface heat output, <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>being</b> <b>due</b> to secular cooling of the earth (about 50 Â°â 100 Â°C per 10 ^ 9 years in the upper mantle).

Geochemical models which are near to chondritic (apart from potassium depletion) are marginally consistent with surface heat flow. In the lunar models, heat generation is typically only 70 â 80 % of the surface heat flow, even with allowance for the strong near-surface enhancement of radioactives. Despite the simplicity of the models the persistence of a significant difference between heat generation and heat output for a wide range of parameter choices indicates that this difference is real and should be incorporated in geochemical modeling of the planets...|$|E

The grouping of tetraploid somatic hybrids into various classes on the basis of leaf morphology revealed that plants with a full chromosome complement were more uniform than aneuploids.

If there is a significant microbial biogeography at the pore scale in soil, then the relationship between microbial diversity and ecosystem function is likely to be affected by micro-environmental variations at the pore scale. In this laboratory study we show that there is a significant pore-scale microbial biogeography by labelling microbial communities in different pore size classes of undisturbed soil cores with 13 C-labelled fructose (a soluble, labile substrate). This was achieved by adding the substrate solution to the samples at different matric potentials (- 100 kPa, - 3. 15 kPa and - 1 kPa; placing the substrate in pores with maximum diameter of 0. 97, 9. 7 and 97 Î¼m, respectively) and incubating the samples for two weeks. The mineralisation of soil organic carbon and fructose was measured as CO 2 and 13 C-CO 2, respectively, in the jar headspace throughout the incubation. At the end of incubation we analysed the total microbial community structure using PLFA. The structure of microbial communities in different pore size classes was measured by PLFA stable isotope probing. Total PLFA profiles suggested that there was little effect of the incubation conditions on microbial community structure. However, labelled PLFA profiles showed that microbial community structure differed significantly among pore size classes, <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>being</b> <b>due</b> primarily to variations in the abundance of mono-unsaturated lipids (Gram-biomarkers) and of the fungal biomarker (C 18 : 2 (9, 12)).

40|$|Background: Colloidal silver {{has been}} used as an {{antibiotic}} for at least 100 years. (1) Patients with rheumatoid arthritis may produce antibodies to both Proteus bacteria and to proteins containing citrullinyl residues. Proteus are enterobacteria also found in the upper urinary tract (notably in females),that are able to transform protein-arginyl residues to antigenic protein-citrullinyl residues. Methods: Anti-arthritic activity was evaluated after orally administering colloidal metallic silver (CMS) to female Wistar rats developing chronic polyarthritis after tailbase injection of either (i) a complete Freundâs adjuvant or (ii) collagen type-II emulsified with an incomplete Freundâs adjuvant or (iii) pristane. Anti-proteus activity was determined by disc diffusion assay by growing P. vulgaris and P. mirabilis on agar plates in the presence of various CMS preparations. Results: A. CMS preparations made electrolytically and administered orally (on alternate days for two weeks) were powerful anti-arthritic agents in rats (ED 80 approx. 85 microgm/kg total silver). Monovalent silver preparations (acetate, nitrate, oxide) were ineffective at twice this dose. B. CMS preparations were also more potent than silver salts in suppressing growth of Proteus sp. in vitro. Against P. mirabilis, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of total silver were greater than 50 nanogm/ml for chemically prepared CMS and less than 6 nanogm/ml for electrolytically prepared CMS: <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>being</b> <b>due</b> to the smaller size of nanoparticles and different Zeta potentials in electrolytic preparations, compared with chemical preparations, of CMS. Conclusions: Pro-arthritic gut micro-organisms may be susceptible to âoldâ antibiotics taken orally such as colloidal silver, as well as to accepted slow-acting anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) originally developed as antibiotics eg minocycline, dapsone, and salazopyrine. However before CMS can be accepted as a pharmaceutical adjunct, more rigorous Quality Controls must be developed for its preparation and physicochemical characterisation â as well as antimicrobial efficacies and general safety.

40|$|Canopy {{transpiration}} is a {{major element}} of the hydrological cycle of temperate forests. Levels of water stress during the 21 st century will be largely controlled by the response of canopy transpiration to changing environmental conditions. One year of transpiration measurement in two stands (Quercus robur L. and Fagus sylvatica L.) was used to calibrate the ASPECTS model on a(1) and D- 0, two parameters of {{a modified version of}} Leuning's equation of stomatal conductance. A second year of data was used to validate the model. The results indicate a higher sensitivity of g(sc), to vapour pressure deficit (DS) in oak than in beech (D- 0 (oak) < D- 0 (beech)). To simulate future forest transpiration, site specific weather data sets were constructed from GCM outputs, spatially and temporally downscaled with local climatic data. Temperature increase between the end of the 20 th and 21 st centuries was predicted to be 2. 8 degreesC in the beech stand and 3. 1 degreesC in the oak stand. Based solely on temperature change, ASPECTS predicted an increase in transpiration of 17 % in the beech and 6 % in the oak stand, <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>being</b> <b>due</b> to variation in local climate and the sensitivity of both species to D-s. Based solely on increased atmospheric CO 2 (355 ppm in 1990 to 700 ppm in 2100), ASPECTS predicted that transpiration would decrease by 22 % in beech and 19 % in oak. With the combined scenarios of climatic change and increased atmospheric CO 2, ASPECTS showed a decrease of 7 % in transpired water in the oak stand and only 4 % in the beech stand, which are not significant differences from zero. Consequently, water stress should not increase in either stand during the 21 st century. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Excitation spectra and {{transient}} and steady-state photoconductivity {{have been}} studied in undoped and 0. 8 -mole% Cu-doped single-crystal Î²-AgI between 150 and 260 Â°K. A single peak in the spectral response was found to occur in each case, at 2. 88 eV for undoped and at 2. 81 eV for copper-doped specimens at 260 K, <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>being</b> <b>due</b> to a decrease in band gap. The anisotropy due to polarization of incident radiation parallel or perpendicular to the c direction, which {{is a measure of}} the energy difference between the Î 9 and Î 7 levels in the valence band, was found to be 0. 010 eV. Transient-photoconductivity experiments showed that the hole lifetime was 6 Î¼ sec at 300 Â°K, an order of magnitude larger than the electron lifetime. The hole drift mobility was found to be 12 Â± 2 cm 2 / V sec at 300 Â°K and limited by traps at a depth of 0. 51 Â± 0. 01 eV with concentration (3 - 5) Ã 109 /cm 3 and capture cross section 10 - 11 cm 2. The study of photoconductivity decay versus temperature revealed the presence of shallow hole traps at 0. 14 Â± 0. 02 eV with concentration greater than 1016 /cm 3 and capture cross section 10 - 19 cm 2. The steady-state photoconductivity was determined by the deep hole traps at 0. 51 eV, and showed the presence of shallow electron traps at a depth of 0. 28 eV. The trap distribution was found to be substantially the same in pure and copper-doped specimens, indicating the monovalent substitutional role of copper. The effects of iodine annealing, cadmium doping, and heating above the transition temperature were also studied. The possible nature of the traps is discussed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{calculate}} the spectra of produced thermal photons in Au+Au collisions {{taking into account}} the nonequilibrium contribution to photon production due to finite shear viscosity. The evolution of the fireball is modeled by second-order as well as by divergence-type 2 + 1 dissipative hydrodynamics, both with an ideal equation of state and with one based on Lattice QCD that includes an analytical crossover. The spectrum calculated in the divergence-type theory is considerably enhanced with respect to the one calculated in the second-order theory, <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>being</b> entirely <b>due</b> to <b>differences</b> in <b>the</b> viscous corrections to photon production. Our results show that <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> in hydrodynamic formalisms are an important source of uncertainty in the extraction of the value of Î·/s from measured photon spectra. The uncertainty in the value of Î·/s associated with different hydrodynamic models used to compute thermal photon spectra is larger than the one occurring in matching hadron elliptic flow to RHIC data...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 1978. AnthropologyBibliography: leaves 103 - 109. Burials {{have long}} been {{regarded}} as a potential storehouse of data for archaeologists. During the late sixties and continuing into the seventies, much of burial analysis {{was and still is}} focused on the determination of the status structure of extinct populations. For the Atlantic Provinces of Canada, however, due to very acidic soil, no suitable sites were available for this type of study. [...] In 1967 - 68, a site with incredibly good bone preservation was excavated at Port au Choix, Newfoundland, by Dr. James A. Tuck of Memorial University in St. John's. This site will be used to investigate the status structure of the Maritime Archaic people who inhabited the area some 4000 years ago. [...] A number of methodologies have been developed to deal with burial attributes and artifacts; but it will be argued that the best methodology for the Port au Choix data consists of an analysis of the qualitative as well as the quantitative aspects of the grave goods. [...] Beyond the simple description of <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> observable, an attempt will be made to relate these differences to other factors of the sociopolitical sphere. For the Port au Choix cemetery, it will be proposed that there was some form of segmentation within the society, and that this may reflect the existence of three separate "family plots" using the same cemetery. This does not preclude the possibility of <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>being</b> <b>due</b> to other factors such as clan or band member-factors such as clan or band membership. [...] Using the Port au Choix site as a test case, the status structure of egalitarian societies in general will be questioned, and answers will be proposed. These will relate to features such as the amount of status differentiation, the basis of these differences (sex, age, achievement, ascription, etc.), and the meaning or function of the artifacts interred with the dead...|$|R
