5|$|As {{a sequel}} to , T2 3-D: Battle Across Time {{introduced}} two new Terminator characters. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Cyberdyne's latest invention, the T-1000000. It is a large spider-like version of the T-1000 that defends Skynet's CPU from attack. Like the T-1000, it is made of mimetic polyalloy, allowing it to form its legs into stabbing weapons. The only known T-1000000 was destroyed when Skynet's core was destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{scholars}} divided inference {{into three}} types. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{expression of the}} connection existing between one proposition and another without any specific effective cause. Next, inference could mean presumption that a state of things, which is not proved to have ceased, still continues. The final type of inference is the authority as to the revealed laws previous to Islam.|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} predators thought to attack healthy adults, and who attack emperor {{penguins}} in the water, are both mammals. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), which takes some adult birds, {{as well as}} fledglings soon after they enter the water. Orcas (Orcinus orca), mostly take adult birds, although they will attack penguins of any age in or near water.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the extreme}} {{difficulty}} of the competition, several stages of preparation are needed. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> food drop, when mushers and race officials position caches of food and supplies at race checkpoints. This is necessary because mushers may only use their supplies along the route, reflecting the Gold Rush era, when dog trains would resupply at points along the trail. One week after the food drop, all dogs participating in the race undergo a preliminary veterinarian inspection to ensure they are healthy enough to race 1,000miles in subarctic conditions. The final stage of formal preparation is {{two days before the}} race, when mushers pick their starting order from a hat.|$|E
5|$|During mating, {{the male}} redback {{attempts}} to copulate by inserting {{one of its}} palps into {{the one of the}} female's two spermathecae (sperm storage organs), each of which has its own insemination orifice. It then tries and often succeeds in inserting the other palp into the female's second orifice. The redback spider is one of only two animals known where the male has been found to actively assist the female in sexual cannibalism. In the process of mating, the much smaller male somersaults to place his abdomen over the female's mouthparts. In about two of three cases, the female fully consumes the male while mating continues. Males which are not eaten die of their injuries soon after mating. Sacrifice during mating is thought to confer two advantages to the species. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> eating process allows {{for a longer period of}} copulation and thus fertilisation of more eggs. The second is females which have eaten a male are more likely to reject subsequent males. Although this prohibits future mating for the males, this is not a serious disadvantage, because the spiders are sufficiently sparse that less than 20% of males ever find a potential mate during their lifetimes, and in any case, the male is functionally sterile if he has used the contents of both of his palps in the first mating.|$|E
5|$|Frusciante {{continued}} {{to collaborate with}} his friend Omar Rodríguez-López. Along with providing guitar work to The Mars Volta's studio albums, The Bedlam In Goliath and Octahedron, and Rodríguez-López's solo albums Se Dice Bisonte, No Búfalo and Calibration (Is Pushing Luck and Key Too Far), he functioned as executive producer for Rodríguez-López's directorial film debut, The Sentimental Engine Slayer. The film debuted at the Rotterdam Film Festival in February 2010. Along with work on the film, Frusciante and Rodríguez-López have released two collaborative records in May 2010. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> album Omar Rodriguez-Lopez & John Frusciante, an album with {{just the two of}} them, the other a quartet record, Sepulcros de Miel, consisting of Rodríguez-López, Frusciante, Juan Alderete and Marcel Rodríguez-López.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to accessories {{such as the}} Power Base Converter, the Sega Genesis supports two add-ons that each support their own game libraries. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Sega CD (known as the Mega-CD in all regions except for North America), a compact disc-based peripheral that can play its library of games in CD-ROM format. The second is the Sega 32X, a 32-bit peripheral which uses ROM cartridges {{and serves as a}} pass-through for Genesis games. Sega produced a custom power strip to fit the peripherals' large AC adapters. Both add-ons were officially discontinued in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pojman has {{suggested}} four strong influences on Kant's ethics. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Lutheran sect Pietism, to which Kant's parents subscribed. Pietism emphasised honesty and moral living over doctrinal belief, {{more concerned with}} feeling than rationality. Kant believed that rationality is required, but {{that it should be}} concerned with morality and good will. Second is the political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose work, The Social Contract, influenced Kant's view on the fundamental worth of human beings. Pojman also cites contemporary ethical debates as influential to the development of Kant's ethics. Kant favoured rationalism over empiricism, which meant he viewed morality as a form of knowledge, rather than something based on human desire. Natural law (the belief that the moral law is determined by nature) and intuitionism (the belief that humans have intuitive awareness of objective moral truths) were, according to Pojman, also influential for Kant.|$|E
5|$|Several {{portraits of}} Octavius survive. Five portraits of him alone {{and one with}} his brother Alfred are housed in the Royal Collection of the United Kingdom. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> more famous {{painting}} by Thomas Gainsborough in 1782, {{which is part of}} a series of paintings of the younger royal children. The second one is after the 1782 portrait by Gainsborough (see above) and is dated to about 1782 or 1784. The third portrait is by Benjamin West and was painted shortly before Octavius's death. Furthermore, among these five portraits, there are two enamels, both after Gainsborough's 1782 portrait; one is by William Bone and the other one is by an anonymous master. The sixth and last portrait represents the apotheosis of Octavius and Alfred (see above) and was painted by West. Another portrait, this time of Queen Charlotte, features Octavius. Painted in 1779 by West, this is both a portrait of the Queen and her children, who are featured in the background. Prince Octavius is at the centre of the group, wearing baby clothes and riding in a little phaeton. He is pulled along by Prince Ernest and pushed by Prince Adolphus.|$|E

5|$|Swami Gnanapragasar {{believes}} that the first Ariyacakravarti also called Cinkaiariyan (Ariyan from Cinkainakar) was Kalinga Magha himself. Three main arguments are adduced to support the claim that these kings were of Eastern Ganga descent. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> similar device on their coins; the bull couchant and the crescent surmounting it were struck on coins issued by the Eastern Gangas and Ariyacakravartis. The second is the traditions of their origins are almost identical. The last is the assumption of titles Kangkainaadan (From the country of Ganges) and Kangkaiariyan (Ariyan from the Ganga dynasty). According to S. Pathmanathan's history of the Jaffna kingdom, these only establish similarity, but not any conclusive direct connections. Pathmanathan {{believes that}} we cannot categorically link the Aryacakravarti dynasty with Eastern Gangas and can explain most of the similarities based on influence, even Western Ganga Dynasty descendants who had moved into Tamil lands after their defeat by the Chola Empire around the year 1000 and interpret them simply as reflecting a claim of origin from the Hindu holy city of Varanasi {{on the banks of}} the holiest river Ganges.|$|E
5|$|The Roman army battled first {{against its}} tribal {{neighbours}} and Etruscan towns within Italy, and later came {{to dominate the}} Mediterranean and at its height the provinces of Britannia and Asia Minor. As with most ancient civilizations, Rome's military served the triple purpose of securing its borders, exploiting peripheral areas through measures such as imposing tribute on conquered peoples, and maintaining internal order. From the outset, Rome's military typified this pattern, {{and the majority of}} Rome's campaigns were characterised by one of two types. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> territorial expansionist campaign, normally begun as a counter-offensive, in which each victory brought subjugation of large areas of territory and allowed Rome to grow from a small town to a population of 55 million in the early empire when expansion was halted. The second is the civil war, which plagued Rome from its foundation to its eventual demise.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} two classifications for teams. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Trofeo Fast Team.

The Trofeo Super Team is a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{production}} proceeded smoothly {{it was not}} without some unusual aspects. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> helpfulness of Cary Grant toward Ingrid Bergman, {{in a way that}} [...] "was remarkably calm and pointedly unusual for him." [...] Although this was Bergman's second outing with Hitchcock (<b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> just-finished Spellbound), she was nervous and insecure early on. The often moody, sometimes withdrawn Grant, though, [...] "came to Notorious full of bounce" [...] and coached her through her initial period of adjustment, rehearsing her the way Devlin rehearses Alicia. This began a lifetime friendship for the two.|$|R
