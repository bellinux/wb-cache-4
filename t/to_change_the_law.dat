5|$|Later in the war, the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Act 1943 {{was passed}} <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> {{to allow the}} {{transfer}} of Militia units to the AIF if 65 {{percent or more of}} their personnel had volunteered for overseas service. Additionally, changes to the Act meant that Militia units were able to serve anywhere south of the Equator in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), excluding western Java and northern Borneo, {{and as a result of}} this, Militia units saw action against Japanese forces in the Dutch East Indies, at Merauke, later in the war. Despite this, the AIF remained the Australian Army's main combat force during the war and indeed more than 200,000 members of the Militia transferred to the AIF throughout the course of the conflict. Nevertheless, 32 Militia infantry battalions, later organised into three Militia divisions (3rd, 5th and 11th), saw service over much of the South West Pacific and participated in the following campaigns: Salamaua-Lae, Huon Peninsula, Finisterre Range, New Britain and Bougainville.|$|E
5|$|On December 29, 2014, Bank Markazi filed a {{petition}} for certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States, requesting the Court {{to consider the}} question: Does §8772 violate {{the separation of powers}} by purporting <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> for, and directing a particular result in, a single pending case? The certiorari petition was circulated to the Justices for their conference on April 3, 2015, after a brief by the respondents (Peterson) opposing certiorari and a reply brief from the petitioner (Bank Markazi) were filed in March. Following the April 3rd conference, the Court called for the Solicitor General to file a brief expressing the views of the federal government, which was filed on August 19. In May and June, the Supreme Court meets only to issue orders and opinions and does not hear oral arguments until the next term begins. The Court granted certiorari following its conference on September 28.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the works}} of Ancient Greek philosophers, the {{principal}} meaning of politeia appears to be: [...] "how a polis is run; constitution". A politeia differs from modern written constitutions in two respects: first, not all Greek states put their laws in writing; more importantly, the Greeks did not normally distinguish between ordinary and constitutional legislation. If a certain body had <b>the</b> power <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws,</b> it had <b>the</b> power <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> controlling its own power and membership - even to abolish itself {{and set up a}} new governing body.|$|R

25|$|Smith and Parkes, {{together}} and apart, wrote many articles {{on education and}} employment opportunities. In {{the same year as}} Norton, Smith summarized the legal framework for injustice in her 1854 A Brief Summary of the Laws of England concerning Women. She was able to reach large numbers of women via her role in the English Women's Journal. The response to this journal led to their creation of the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women (SPEW). Smith's Married Women's Property committee collected 26,000 signatures <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> for all women, including those unmarried.|$|E

25|$|Positions on the MARTA {{board are}} {{directly}} {{appointed by the}} organizations they represent. Although the state of Georgia does not contribute to MARTA's operational funding, it still has voting members on the MARTA board. A similar situation existed for both Clayton and Gwinnett counties during most of MARTA's history; {{as a consequence of}} passing the authorization referendum but not the funding referendum. Gwinnett County have representation on the MARTA Board of Directors without paying into the system. This situation became controversial in 2004 when Gwinnett's representative Mychal Walker was found to have accepted US$20,000 from a lobbyist trying to secure a US$100,000,000 contract with MARTA. Despite the controversy, as well as a MARTA board ruling that Walker violated the MARTA ethics policy, the Gwinnett County Commission initially failed to remove Mr. Walker from his position on the MARTA Board. Eventually, the state legislature was called upon <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> governing MARTA's Board to allow for the removal of a member whose appointing county did not act on a request for removal. Before the new law could be used, Mr. Walker was arrested on an unrelated child support violation, which resulted in his firing by the Gwinnett County Commission.|$|E
25|$|The second great {{influence}} on Bracton's thinking was William Raleigh, {{also known as}} William de Raley, a native of Devon. He was a resident in and around Bratton Fleming in 1212, when Bracton was born there. Raleigh was a justice of the bench in 1228. In 1234 he pronounced reversal judgment of Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent's outlawry. Though {{he was not a}} justicier, he was regarded as the chief among judges. In 1237 he was appointed treasurer of Exeter Cathedral. He was elected to the See of Winchester in 1238 and passed from legal history. His election to this position was violently opposed by the King who favoured William of Valence. In 1239 Raleigh was elected to the See of Norwich. In 1244 {{he was elected to the}} See of Winchester for a second time. He died in 1250. He had much to do with the passage of the Statute of Merton. Raleigh defended the refusal of the barons <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of bastardy and legitimation. He invented the writ Quare ejecit infra terminum and was influential in the writing of several other novel writs. It is from Bracton that we get the majority of the history of the law at this time. Bracton is thought to have had a notebook with 2000 cases from Pateshull and Raleigh.|$|E

However, doubts have always surrounded the identity of his true father.

Abbas Helmi I, eager <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of succession in favor of his son and to bypass Ibrahim Pasha's children, tried to discredit the latter by spreading a rumour that Ibrahim was the son of Muhammad Ali's wife from a previous marriage to her tutor.|$|E

500|$|Some protesters {{have argued}} that because the Sixteenth Amendment does not contain the words [...] "repeal" [...] or [...] "repealed", the Amendment is {{ineffective}} <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> [...] Others argue that due to language in Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., the income tax is an unconstitutional direct tax that should be apportioned (divided equally amongst {{the population of the}} various states). [...] Several tax protesters assert that the Congress has no constitutional power to tax labor or income from labor, citing a variety of court cases. These arguments include claims that the word [...] "income" [...] as used in the Sixteenth Amendment cannot be interpreted as applying to wages; that wages are not income because labor is exchanged for them; that taxing wages violates individuals' right to property, and several others.|$|E

This was especially evident when in 2005 the government called off the Shia branch of the [...] "Family law" [...] after over 100,000 Shia took to the streets. Islamists opposed the law because [...] "neither elected MPs nor the government has the authority <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> because these institutions could misinterpret the word of God".

500|$|Mike Thompson {{discovered}} in a poll taken in March 1977 that women in Dade County opposed repealing the measure two to one; they saw their gay friends as relatively harmless. Save Our Children's strategy, therefore, worked to prove that homosexuals were amoral, promiscuous, and defiant of traditional gender roles, {{and that they were}} a specific danger to children. Bryant took this strategy as a crusade, delivering speeches that intoned that Dade County's passing of the ordinance [...] "guts the law {{on the side of the}} unrighteous. If homosexuals are allowed <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> in their favor, why not prostitutes, thieves, or murderers?" [...] She specifically connected homosexuals with child molesters, saying [...] "Some of the stories I could tell you of child recruitment and child abuse by homosexuals would turn your stomach."

500|$|Lady Hale {{was also}} {{concerned}} about the ramifications of the decision. [...] She asked if a doctor treating a patient after an accident and giving evidence about what happened as well as his opinions as to what would happen would be covered or not, or whether only in part. She noted that the ruling in the case would have to apply to experts dealing with cases before tribunals as well as courts, thus including claims for unfair dismissal before employment tribunals and disputes between landlord and tenants about service charges and rent assessments. [...] She queried whether it ought to extend to psychiatrists assessing patients for tribunal proceedings under the Mental Health Act 1983, or educational psychologists giving evidence about children with special educational needs in tribunal proceedings about their future education. In her view, these are [...] "sensitive and often highly fraught cases in which performing the expert's duty to the tribunal may well be perceived by the client patient or parent as a breach of her duty towards him." [...] In family law cases, she said, there would now be some professional witnesses who had immunity from negligence claims for their evidence and others who did not, with some of the distinctions between the two groups appearing to be [...] "arbitrary". She thought that the decision might make experts more likely to confirm their previous views rather than change them, and could lead to higher insurance premiums for experts, increased fees and the use of exemption clauses in contracts – [...] "in which case we shall be back where we started", she said. Overall, she called the decision <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> [...] "irresponsible" [...] and, like Lord Hope, considered that the topic was best left to Parliament and the Law Commission.|$|E
