SuperUber worked on integration between animations and technology, the structure design and projection mapping that took over the General Assembly Hall after it was invited by Kenzo Digital. 10 20K HLM Barco projectors were placed and mapping was done using Pandora's widget designer and 5 Pandora's Dual Box servers. The final video had an 8856 x 1664 resolution and was split into 10 slices of 1080 x 1664 pixels, since each projector was turned on its side and the images were projected vertically in order to cover the whole structure. Two slices were fed into each system and SuperUber did the warping and edge blending inside Pandora. The screen which was used was over 12,000 square feet; Lucas Werthein, a representative for SuperUber commented that it was the largest indoor temporary screen that was a tilted compound curve adding that from an engineering standpoint, it is [...] "extremely complex". It was custom-designed <b>to</b> <b>mold</b> <b>to</b> the inside of the General Assembly Hall. It spanned 68m X 15m and surrounded the audience with a 240 degree immersive projection. Ten synchronized and mapped projections covered the screen with 200,000 lumens, creating one continuous giant image. The screen which weighed 1000 pounds was sewn by forty five people. The whole structure, which was hanging off the UN ceiling weighed 6000 pounds. Werthein revealed, [...] "In order to create the proper tension for the screen to hold its shape we had to weld permanent rigging points into the dome of the general assembly." [...] Peter Kirn of Create Digital Motion wrote that the projection mapping was performed onto a fairly simple surface: [...] "What makes the mapping so effective {{is the way in which}} it can fill the space, making those pictures immersive on a grand architectural scale. It makes the image a real volume in which the performance can take place." [...] Russ Rive, SuperUber’s director said, [...] "It’s an ambitious project that has completely transformed an iconic location – seen as immutable and unchanging, with its goldplated panel and grand volume. By adding a virtual layer to it, we could digitally rebuild it, playing with the architectural elements, and therefore changing the notion of something static. The technology made the integration between animation and architecture. We used projectors to 'paint with light' the UN General Assembly’s Hall – a unique opportunity to transform such an emblematic place." ...|$|E

5000|$|Kinases are {{classified}} into broad groups by the substrate they act upon: protein kinases, lipid kinases, carbohydrate kinases. Kinases {{can be found}} in a variety of species, from bacteria <b>to</b> <b>mold</b> <b>to</b> worms to mammals. [...] More than five hundred different kinases have been identified in humans. Their diversity and their role in signaling makes them an interesting object of study. Various other kinases act on small molecules such as lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, and nucleotides, either for signaling or to prime them for metabolic pathways. Specific kinases are often named after their substrates. Protein kinases often have multiple substrates, and proteins can serve as substrates for more than one specific kinase. For this reason protein kinases are named based on what regulates their activity (i.e. Calmodulin-dependent protein kinases). Sometimes they are further subdivided into categories because there are several isoenzymatic forms. For example, type I and type II cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinases have identical catalytic subunits but different regulatory subunits that bind cyclic AMP.|$|E

40|$|Surgical {{treatment}} of high perianal fistulas, which affect {{a significant proportion}} of the sphincter apparatus, is difficult and associated with considerable risk of impaired anal continence. The diversity of approaches proposed for the {{treatment of}} complex perianal fistulas reflects the fact that no method has yet been shown to be fully satisfactory. We believe the successful treatment of this condition is directly proportional to the amount of fibrous tissue that can be removed. We used a kit of small curettes, of different thicknesses and sizes, incorporating spicules that enable the physician to remove fibrous tissue from the fistula tract. The small size and varying thicknesses of the curettes enable them <b>to</b> <b>mold</b> <b>to</b> the curves of the fistula tract and to remove tissue by de-roofing from the shallowest to the deepest layers, thus excising the entire fibrous tract.

40|$|Every year tens of {{millions}} worldwide suffer from cartilage damage, caused by mechanical degradation, trauma or disease. Because {{of the lack of}} blood supply and low cell concentration within the tissue, cartilage has very limited regenerative ability. Although current treatments can provide symptomatic relief, the results vary greatly among individuals, and newly formed tissue often does not duplicate the structure, composition or mechanical properties of normal cartilage. Therefore, in recent years, tissue engineering has emerged as an alternative therapy. Tissue engineering enhances the body's natural healing capacity by providing cells, signaling molecules, and an environment {{in the form of a}} scaffold that is conducive to tissue growth. This project has focused on the development of a tissue engineering scaffold for cartilage regeneration. Disadvantages to current scaffolds include the fact that they require surgery for implantation, and that they are difficult <b>to</b> <b>mold</b> <b>to</b> the exact shape of the defect site. Hence, the motivation of this thesis is to develop an injectable scaffold that can be administered in a minimally invasive manner, and that allows for scaffold formation in situ, naturally shaping the construct into the shape of the defect, and thus promoting integration and stabilit...|$|E
40|$|The Namesake, by Jhumpa Lahiri, is a {{story of}} culture, race, and {{inheritance}} and how these factors mold our attitudes and direct our lives in an ever-changing society. The novel follows the lives of Ashima and Asoke Ganguli, and how they left behind a life in India that they had grown to know and love to live the American dream and provide the best life for themselves and their children. Gogol, their only son, and the carrier of their family name, struggles incessantly to find his identity while attempting <b>to</b> <b>mold</b> <b>to</b> his family’s expectations and the expectations of American society. The latter dictated that adhering to the model of the Standard North American family establishes normalcy. Gogol engages in a constant struggle to remain loyal to both worlds. Hence, the major theme portrayed in the novel is one of identity. This them is illustrated vividly by examining the importance of one’s culture and background, gender, and name as the definition of patriarchal lineage and destiny in life. Such factors that contribute to problems with identity are not only recognizable in Indian cultures, but can become hindrances for many immigrants who enter the United States each year...|$|E

40|$|Not only {{is there}} no {{apparent}} need for our big brains, but they are evolutionary big trouble. Big brains must be housed in large braincases—our heads. And {{if there was anything}} our evolving ancestors did not want, it was that their heads would grow big. For a start, big heads make birth long and difficult. The birth canal of modern mothers is only just big enough for a baby’s head. Even then, the baby must be turned on its side half way through to squeeze out. A human baby’s head is uniquely round, which helps it “roll ” on the way out, and its head and body are able to rotate. The mother’s pelvis may have a small opening relative to the size of her child’s head, but it is shaped optimally to aid its head-first birth. (Breech delivery—head last—in most cases requires a cesarean section.) The baby’s cranium is incomplete at birth. Fontanelles, or gaps between its bones, allow the head <b>to</b> <b>mold</b> <b>to</b> shape of the pelvic opening. In fact, about one in six babies ’ heads end up getting noticeably changed in shape during delivery.

40|$|Extensive trauma, tumor {{resection}} or {{congenital abnormalities}} {{can lead to}} craniofacial bone defects that require intervention for repair. These defects are often treated with autologous grafts, which are limited in supply, often result in donor site morbidity, and are difficult <b>to</b> <b>mold</b> <b>to</b> appropriately match craniofacial contours. This thesis focused on the synthesis and characterization of a novel, in situ-forming biodegradable hydrogel for cellular delivery in craniofacial bone tissue engineering. To generate these hydrogels, a novel, thermogelling macromer containing pendant phosphate groups was synthesized and subsequently modified by the attachment of chemically cross-linkable methacrylate groups. The components of these macromers varied to evaluate the effects of differing components on macromer properties. This information was used to select two formulations of macromers that were shown to remain in solution at room temperature and undergo dual thermo and chemical gelation to form stable hydrogels at physiologic temperature. The hydrogels formed from these macromers were characterized for cytotoxicity and rate of degradation, which {{was found to be}} accelerated in the presence of alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme that is upregulated in newly formed bone. Furthermore, they were shown to support encapsulated mesenchymal stem cells for up to 28 days and undergo cellular induced mineralization under osteogenic conditions. These gels were then evaluated for their ability to generate bone in a critical-size rate cranial defect. The hydrogels demonstrated degradation within the defect and subsequent bone growth into the defect. Finally, the effects of incorporation of inorganic hydroxyapatite nanoparticles into the gels on cellular interaction and hydrogel physiochemical properties were evaluated. This research demonstrated the potential for thermogelling macromers to be designed to form degradable hydrogels {{that can be used to}} deliver cells into craniofacial bone defects...|$|E
40|$|A disserta??o Sociabilidade e Cultura. A Hist?ria dos pequenos teatros na cidade de Manaus (1859 - 1900) aborda as express?es culturais da sociedade amazonense durante o per?odo provincial, enfocando os primeiros teatros da cidade: o Teatro feito de Palha descrito pelo viajante alem?o Robert Av?-Lallemant, o Teatro Variedade Comica, de Lima Penante, o Teatro Beneficente Portuguesa e o ?den Teatro, constru?dos antes do suntuoso Teatro Amazonas. Fundamentando-se nos preceitos da Nova Hist?ria Cultural, trata-se do estudo de um momento {{anterior}} ? grande produ??o da borracha, quando os espa?os da cidade e os costumes de seus moradores come?avam a se modificar e a se moldar ao gosto europeu. A pesquisa utilizou-se de fontes bibliogr?ficas e documentais, assim foram explorados al?m de textos que fundamentam teoricamente o trabalho, peri?dicos do s?culo XIX e in?cio do s?culo XX. Recorremos tamb?m, a outras pesquisas sobre o tema, que analisam a mesma ?poca, embora em outras prov?ncias. O objetivo foi colocar em pr?tica o exerc?cio da compara??o, atitude fundamental na an?lise hist?rica. Neste contexto, foi examinado os primeiros aspectos civilizat?rios que chegavam a Manaus, as vestimentas europeizadas e os modos contidos de se portar em p?blico, tudo a partir da ?nfase das manifesta??es teatrais, que procuravam entreter a popula??o, e ao mesmo tempo, educ?-la, no aspecto da moralidade baseada nos ideais burgueses, ou no comportado refinado e educado que se exigia em p?blico. Em contrapartida estudou-se tamb?m as sociabilidades e h?bitos dos habitantes locais, como os bailes, as festas religiosas, a pesca, os banhos em igarap?s. Uma das conclus?es desse estudo ? que embora o tema exija continuidade de investiga??o, h? poucas pesquisas sobre a cultura desse per?odo. Isto indica dentre outras coisas, a exist?ncia de um poss?vel preconceito quanto ao tema: sendo a popula??o composta basicamente por ind?genas e seus descendentes, eles teriam lazeres que n?o poderiam ter relev?ncia para estudo: como se somente o lazer e os costumes europeus pudessem ser significativos. The dissertation called Sociability and Culture. The History of {{the small}} theaters {{in the city of}} Manaus (1859 - 1900) approaches the cultural expressions of the amazonian society during the provincial period, focusing on the first theaters of the city: the Straw Theater described by the German traveller Robert Ave-Lallemant, the Comic Variety Theater, from Lima Penante, the Portuguese Beneficient Theater and the Paradise Theater, all of them builded before the sumptuous Amazon Theater. Basing on the rules of the New Cultural History, it is concerning the study of a previous moment to the great production of the rubber, when the spaces {{of the city and the}} customs of its inhabitants started to modify and <b>to</b> <b>mold</b> <b>to</b> the European style. The research used bibliographical sources and registers, no matter they had been explored beyond some texts that theoretically base the periodic task, at the of the 19 th century and at the beginning of the 20 th century. We also appeal to other researches on the subject, that analyze the same time, even in other provinces. The objective was to put in practice the exercise of the comparison, that is a basic attitude in the historical analysis. In this context, the first aspects on civilization that arrived to Manaus were examined, the european clothes and the ways of behavior in public, everything from the emphasis of the theater manifestations, that traied to entertain the population, and at the same time, to educate it, in the aspect of the morality based on the bourgeois ideals, or the fine and educated held that was demanded in public. On the other hand, there were also studied the sociabilities and habits of the local inhabitants, like the balls, the religious parties, fishing, the baths in smalls rivers, and so on. One of the conclusions of this study is that even the subject demands inquiry continuity, there are few researches on the culture in that period. This points out amongst other things, the existence of a possible preconception on the subject: being the population composed basically by natives and their descendants, they would have leisure that they could not have relevance for this study: as if the European leisure and customs they only could be significant...|$|E
