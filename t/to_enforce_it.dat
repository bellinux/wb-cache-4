In December 1863, the Union League Club recruited over 2,000 black soldiers, outfitted and trained them, honoring and sending men off with a parade through the city to the Hudson River docks in March 1864.

5|$|A {{new system}} of {{controlling}} {{the movement of the}} First Nations was introduced by the government after the rebellion. Known as the pass system, this required any individual leaving a reserve to possess a pass signed by a government agent, or to face arrest by the police. The police received advice that the new policy was illegal, as it contravened Treaty 7, which had given guarantees of free movement, but they continued <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> <b>it</b> for several years. Eventually the force turned to the vagrancy laws as an alternative approach for removing First Nations from selected areas. Police used agents employed to collect intelligence from within First Nation and Métis communities, and, from 1887, they also employed members of the First Nations as special constables, typically deploying them as scouts and trackers. These scouts wore an informal uniform and were empowered to arrest other members of their communities, but not whites.|$|E
5|$|The twin {{impacts of}} hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel {{prompted}} officials in Mexico {{to declare a}} state of emergency in 155municipalities in Veracruz, Tamaulipas, Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Chihuahua. The nation's Health Ministry sent medical crews across the country to affected areas in an effort {{to prevent the spread of}} disease; the agency also suggested residents boil their water. Officials opened shelters in Tamaulipas for residents whose houses were damaged, housing about 2,000people in the weeks following the storm. The Mexican food bank sent about 800tons of food to the hardest-hit parts of the country in Guerrero, Veracruz, and Sinaloa. In addition, the Mexican Red Cross delivered 186tons of food to Veracruz alone. Volunteers delivered about 600blankets and various cleaning supplies to the town of Pánuco. Following the storms, the National Civil Protection Coordination received the authority to prevent housing construction in areas at risk for mudslides and flooding; the law had passed in 2012, but initially lacked the authority <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> <b>it.</b> Some residents in Tamaulipas complained at the slow pace of receiving aid.

25|$|Asquith {{responded with}} two notes, the first {{countering}} the Unionist {{claim that it}} would be acceptable for the King to dismiss Parliament or withhold assent of the Bill to force an election, and the second arguing that a Home Rule election would not prove anything, since a Unionist victory would only be due to other problems and scandals and would not assure supporters of the current government that Home Rule was truly opposed. The King instead pressed for a compromise, summoning various political leaders to Balmoral Castle individually for talks. Law arrived on 13 September and again pointed out to the king his belief that if the Government continued to refuse an election fought over Home Rule and instead forced it on Ulster, the Ulstermen would not accept it and any attempts <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> <b>it</b> would not be obeyed by the British Army.|$|E
25|$|In June 1435, {{family members}} {{gathered}} {{to put a}} curb on Gilles. They appealed to Pope Eugene IV to disavow the Chapel of the Holy Innocents (which he refused to do) and carried their concerns to the king. On 2July 1435, a royal edict was proclaimed in Orléans, Tours, Angers, Pouzauges and Champtocé-sur-Loire denouncing Gilles as a spendthrift and forbidding him from selling any further property. No subject of Charles VII was allowed to enter into any contract with him, and those in command of his castles were forbidden to dispose of them. Gilles' credit fell immediately and his creditors pressed upon him. He borrowed heavily, using his objets d'art, manuscripts, books and clothing as security. When he left Orléans in late August or early September 1435, the town was littered with precious objects {{he was forced to}} leave behind.

25|$|Both North West and Hudson’s Bay {{companies}} formally {{protested the}} proclamation, but Lord Selkirk, being the majority shareholder of the HBC {{was able to}} deal with his company’s complaints through official channels. Special Commissioner Coltman, the government official later charged with investigating the Battle of Seven Oaks, suggested that Gov. Macdonell waited for an opportune moment to release his proclamation, the idea of which he had brought up some time earlier, and suggested that moment was the American victory at the Battle of Lake Erie which occurred September 10, 1813 which gave the Americans command of Lake Erie and threatened the NWC’s ability to transport goods, furs and provisions over the Great Lakes. Issuing the proclamation at this time therefore would have starved the Nor’westers out of the region. In fact, the Nor’Westers would later testify that the British loss of Lake Erie rendered the company more dependent on the Red River pemmican than ever. The NWC disregarded the proclamation and Gov.

25|$|One {{theory is}} that these {{problems}} are caused by a structural contradiction within the euro system, the {{theory is that}} there is a monetary union (common currency) without a fiscal union (e.g., common taxation, pension, and treasury functions). In the Eurozone system, the countries are required to follow a similar fiscal path, but they do not have common treasury <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> <b>it.</b> That is, countries with the same monetary system have freedom in fiscal policies in taxation and expenditure. So, even though there are some agreements on monetary policy and through the European Central Bank, countries may not be able to or would simply choose not to follow it. This feature brought fiscal free riding of peripheral economies, especially represented by Greece, as it is hard to control and regulate national financial institutions. Furthermore, there is also a problem that the Eurozone system has a difficult structure for quick response. Eurozone, having 18 nations as its members, require unanimous agreement for a decision making process. This would lead to failure in complete prevention of contagion of other areas, as it would be hard for the Eurozone to respond quickly to the problem.|$|E
