5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the Army's contract, the XR-1 was returned to the company, Platt-LePage believing that the design had potential as a civilian aircraft. The planned civilian version, the PL-9, {{would have been an}} enlarged, twin-engined aircraft; however Platt-LePage was by now in serious financial difficulty following {{the cancellation}} of its Army contract, and in mid 1946 the XR-1's flight test program was concluded, the aircraft being retired <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> Institution.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, there were rumours about {{surviving}} mammoths in Alaska. In October 1899, Henry Tukeman detailed his {{killing of a}} mammoth in Alaska and his subsequent donation of the specimen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> Institution in Washington, D.C.. The museum denied the story. Bengt Sjögren believed that the myth began when the American biologist Charles Haskins Townsend travelled in Alaska, saw Eskimos trading mammoth tusks, asked if there were still living mammoths in Alaska, and provided them with a drawing of the animal.|$|E

5|$|The PRR again {{borrowed}} the locomotive from 1933 to 1934 for the Century of Progress exhibition in Chicago. Unlike its earlier jaunt to Chicago, for this trip, the railroad hauled and displayed it as a static exhibit. While this exhibit was progressing, the Altoona Works were busy again building a replica; {{this time the}} replica was an operable copy of the locomotive. The replica was then operated in 1940 at the New York World's Fair, while the original locomotive and rebuilt tender returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Smithsonian Institution {{displayed}} a Little Boy (complete, except for enriched uranium), until 1986. The Department of Energy took the weapon {{from the museum}} to remove its inner components, so the bombs could not be stolen and detonated with fissile material.

5|$|After the war, the Enola Gay {{returned}} to the United States, where it was operated from Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico. In May 1946, it was flown to Kwajalein for the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in the Pacific, but was not chosen to make the test drop at Bikini Atoll. Later that year it was transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> Institution, and spent many years parked at air bases exposed to the weather and souvenir hunters, before being disassembled and transported to the Smithsonian's storage facility at Suitland, Maryland, in 1961.|$|E
5|$|As a student, Kincaid showed {{exceptional}} {{aptitude for}} the natural sciences and achieved national attention for his scientific achievements. In 1897, while still an undergraduate, he accompanied David Starr Jordan to the Pribilof Islands {{as part of a}} study of seals undertaken by the American Fur Seal Commission. Back in Washington, Kincaid's interests focused more on insect life, and a report that year in the Boston Evening Transcript noted that he had discovered 41 new species of bees, including 22 of the genus Osmia. Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell, at the time one of America's leading entomologists, directed a portion of the sizable Kincaid bee collection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> Institution.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1938, the Mingo Oak failed to produce leaves, and on May of that year, West Virginia state {{forester}} D.B. Griffin announced the tree's death. The prevailing {{theory is that the}} tree died from the release of poisonous gases and sulfur fumes from a burning spoil tip in nearby Trace Gap. The tree was felled with fanfare on September 23, 1938, with transections being sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> Institution and the West Virginia State Museum. Under the terms of the Island Creek Coal Company's lease with the West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission, the land's lease around the former tree reverted to the company following the tree's felling.|$|E

40|$|Although coffee {{does not}} need {{pollination}} to produce berries, visits by African honeybees can induce more and heavier (25 %) berries. According <b>to</b> researchers from <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> Tropical Research Institute, the coffee tree benefits from the exchange of genetic variation caused by the bees. This could explain the recent drops in yields in Africa and Asia, where the natural habitats for bees have shrunk and the intensive cultivation of coffee has been replacing multi-storey, mixed plantations.

5|$|In 1956, Johnson's life's {{work was}} almost {{destroyed}} when his caretaker declared him {{unable to pay}} further storage fees. Instead, Helen Harriton, Mary Beattie Brady, and others arranged with the court to have Johnson's belongings delivered to the Harmon Foundation with unconditional rights over all works. The foundation would use the works to advance interracial understanding and support African American achievements in the fine arts. On April 19, 1967, the Harmon Foundation gave more than 1,000 paintings, watercolors, and prints by Johnson <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> American Art Museum.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Oliver Butterworth {{authored}} a children's book, The Enormous Egg.

The dinosaur, named Uncle Beazley, becomes too big, so the boy brings him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> Institution in Washington, D.C. Beazley is first kept at National Museum of Natural History, but is eventually transferred to the National Zoo's Elephant House because there is a law against stabling large animals in the District of Columbia.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Sarria gave a small {{selection}} of costumes, accessories, and documents to the Oakland Museum of California—including a cape and headdress {{that he wore}} in performances of his comic version of Aida at The Black Cat. Sarria continued to own a smaller collection of art, artifacts and documentation; he had said that he expected to eventually donate those materials to the GLBT Historical Society. An article published in The Atlantic in 2011 asserted that Sarria had also donated materials <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> Institution. This claim appears to be erroneous, as Sarria stated in 2012 that he declined the Smithsonian's request.|$|E

5|$|It {{was hoped}} that the Air Force would guard the plane, but, lacking hangar space, it was left {{outdoors}} on a remote part of the air base, exposed to the elements. Souvenir hunters broke in and removed parts. Insects and birds then gained access to the aircraft. Paul E. Garber of the Smithsonian Institution, became concerned about the Enola Gays condition, and on 10 August 1960, Smithsonian staff began dismantling the aircraft. The components were transported <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> storage facility at Suitland, Maryland, on 21 July 1961.|$|E
5|$|There {{are only}} seven {{absolute}} world records for fixed-wing aircraft {{recognized by the}} Fédération Aéronautique Internationale and Fossett broke three {{of them in the}} Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer.

Fossett contributed the GlobalFlyer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> Institution's permanent collection. It is on display at the Udvar-Hazy Center of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. Fossett flew the plane to the Center and taxied the plane to the front door.|$|E
5|$|Various {{estimates}} {{place the}} tree's seeding sometime between 1354 and 1361 AD. Using borings from the tree, the Smithsonian Institution {{determined that the}} Mingo Oak was the oldest tree of its species. In September 1932, West Virginia state forester D.B. Griffin and Emmett Keadle, president of the Mingo County Fish and Game Protective Association in Williamson, used an increment borer to estimate the tree as having begun its growth around 1356, with {{a margin of error}} within 25 or 30 years. Blueprints and boring samples were given to the West Virginia State Museum in Charleston and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> Institution in Washington, D.C.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> Institution Building (also {{known as}} [...] "The Castle") was {{completed}} in 1855 to house an art gallery, a library, a chemical laboratory, lecture halls, museum galleries, and offices. During this time <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> was a learning institution concerned mainly with enhancing science and less interested in being a museum. Under the second secretary, Spencer Fullerton Baird, <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> turned into a full-fledged museum, mostly through the acquisition of 60 boxcars worth of displays from the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. The income from the exhibition of these artifacts allowed {{for the construction of}} the National Museum, which is now known as the Arts and Industries Building.
