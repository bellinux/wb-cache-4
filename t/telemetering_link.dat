40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThe {{ability to}} display, expand, time frame select, and {{permanently}} record data of high interest/high frequency over long time periods provides {{the capability to}} analyze data in near real time and provide immediate responses to laboratory or remote platform/onboard system problems. Many recording techniques provide large recording bandwidths, but do not also provide an immediate hard copy readout from which early decisions can be made. A wider bandwidth capability can expand the already large spectrum of visicorder uses. This paper describes a new high speed recording capability which involves the introduction of an x/y converter/fiber-optic visicorder system into a <b>telemetering</b> <b>link</b> that can record one MHz data {{for long periods of}} time, together with time frame selection capability. The system can provide line continuous monitoring of high interest data...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method of designing descrete-type load frequency regulator with the first-order holder improved for ramp load disturbances. An attractive {{feature of the}} proposed control scheme is that the first-order holder is used as the hold device and then, {{in addition to the}} accumulative quantity of the area control error, the accumulative quantity of time multiplied by the area control error is used as feedback signal. Another feature is that it considers the time delay due to the computation time of the control law and the transmission time of the system data over the <b>telemeter</b> <b>links</b> to the controlling plant. The proposed control scheme is illustrated by digital simulation of a 2 -area system provided with reheat steam turbines...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 17 - 20, 1994 / Town & Country Hotel and Conference Center, San Diego, CaliforniaCurrent {{theories}} {{concerning the}} surface of Titan postulate the existence of large, possibly oceanic, bodies of liquid ethane/ammonia plus various other chemicals. ESA's Huygens probe is designed to gather oceanographic data on Titan. If the postulated oceans or lakes do exist, follow up missions of an oceanographic nature will be planned. This paper provides a concept for a modified XBT (eXpendable Bathymetric Thermograph) probe design that will provide more data than just temperature {{as a function of}} depth. By judicious use of acoustic <b>telemetering</b> <b>links,</b> data on the sound speed profile and constituents of the ocean can be obtained. The exo-oceanographic data collected will have important ramifications for oceanographic studies on Earth...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method of designing discrete-type load-frequency regulator for interconnected power systems. An especially attractive {{feature of the}} proposed control scheme is that it requires as inputs signals accumulative quantities of area control error. An additional feature is that it considers the time delay due to the computation time of the control law and the transmission time of the system data over the <b>telemeter</b> <b>links</b> to the controlling plant. The realization of such a regulator may be easy and of low cost because of its simple construction. In this paper, we apply the above method to 3 ï½ž 5 area systems provided with nonreheat type turbines. The {{results show that the}} proposed discrete-type regulator can act satisfactorily for improving dynamic responses of the load-frequency control...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method of designing decentralised discrete-type load-frequency regulator with controlling delay of one sampling time for interconnected power systems. In this method, the interconnected multi-area electric energy system is decomposed into several subsystems, {{each of which}} is controlled separately by using a local feedback only. An especially attractive feature of the proposed control scheme is that it considers the time delay due to the computation time of the control law and the transmission time of the system data over the <b>telemeter</b> <b>links</b> to the controlling plant. An additional feature is that the construction of the regulator is based on the conventional tie-line bias control. The proposed control scheme is illustrated by digital simulation of a 2 -area system provided with reheat steam turbines. The results show that this discrete-type regulator can act satisfactorily for improving dynamic responses of the load-frequency control...|$|R

40|$|A three channel {{telemetry}} system {{intended for}} biomedical applications is described. The transmitter is implemented {{in a single}} chip using a 2 micron BiCMOS processes. The operation {{of the system and}} the test results from the latest chip are discussed. One channel is always dedicated to temperature measurement while the other two channels are generic. The generic channels carry information from transducers that are interfaced to the system through on-chip general purpose operational amplifiers. The generic channels have different bandwidths: one from dc to 250 Hz and the other from dc to 1300 Hz. Each generic channel modulates a current controlled oscillator to produce a frequency modulated signal. The two frequency modulated signals are summed and used to amplitude modulate the temperature signal which acts as a carrier. A near-field inductive <b>link</b> <b>telemeters</b> the combined signals over a short distance. The chip operates on a supply voltage anywhere from 2. 5 to 3. 6 Volts and draws less than 1 mA when transmitting a signal. The chip can be incorporated into ingestible, implantable and other configurations. The device can free the patient from tethered data collection systems and reduces the possibility of infection from subcutaneous leads. Data telemetry can increase patient comfort leading to a greater acceptance of monitoring...|$|R
