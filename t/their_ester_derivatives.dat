Biocatalyst EST 12 - 7 could hydrolyze racemic methyl 2 -chloropropinate and generate optically pure (R) -methyl 2 -chloropropinate with high enantiomeric excess (> 99 %) and conversion (> 49 %) after process optimization.

40|$|Summary: Recently, {{epoxides}} {{have received}} increased attention {{because they are}} of interest both as end-products and as chemical intermediates; epoxidized oils, mainly High Oleic Sunflower Oil, and <b>their</b> <b>ester</b> <b>derivatives</b> have thus found important applications as plasticizers and additives for polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Epoxidized esters have been produced classically from High Oleic Sunflower Methyl Esters (HOSME) using H 2 O 2 and formic acid. The epoxidation reaches 90 % on pilot scale (5 kg). Epoxidized esters produced from HOSME have respectively hydroxyl values of 0, oxirane values of 5. 2 / 4. 5 and iodine values of 1. 7 / 1. 5.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} investigations {{related to}} interactions of chelating ligands (macrocyclic and acyclic) with neutral and ionic species in solution. Following a brief introduction on coordination chemistry, each topic is presented separately in three chapters. In Chapter I, thermodynamic studies on drug cyclodextrin interactions {{in water and}} in chloroform at 298. 15 K are discussed {{in relation to the}} effect of the macrocycle on the transfer of N 1 -substituted sulphonamides from water to chloroform. It is concluded that the transfer of the drug in this solvent system is thermodynamically more favoured in the absence than in the presence of cyclodextrin. Chapter II concerns thermodynamic aspects on calixarenes and <b>their</b> <b>ester</b> <b>derivatives.</b> As far as calixarenes are concerned, thermodynamic parameters of complexation of tert-butylamine and p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene in benzonitrile suggest that two processes are involved; the formation of the adduct followed by that of an endo-calix complex. The interaction of alkyl-p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene tetraethanoates with alkali-metal cations in acetonitrile and in benzonitrile at 298. 15 K was studied by titration calorimetry. The limitation of this technique to derive stability constant data for highly stable complexes {{led to the development of}} a double competitive potentiometric method. Thermodynamic data are discussed in terms of the solvation of host, guest and resulting complex in these solvents. Chapter III discusses synthesis, characterisation and acid-base properties of ethylenedinitrilo-N,N 1 -diacetic-N,N 1 -bis(1 -phenylethylacetamido) acid (edtamba) and ethylenedinitrilo-N,N 1 -diacetic-N,N'bis(pyridylacetamidoacetamioe) acid (edtapa) This is followed by the thermodynamics of complexation of these ligands with metal cations (Pb(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) and Co(II) in water at 298. 15 K. These results show that unlike EDTA, edtamba and edtapa do not interact selectively with these cations as a result of a remarkable enthalpy-entropy compensation effect.

40|$|The phisico-chemical {{properties}} of bio- and drug molecules greatly influence their interactions {{in the body}} and strongly effect the mechanism of drug action. Among these properties, macroscopic and site-specific protonation constants are of crucial importance. Latter one is the tool to calculate the relative concentration of the various microspecies in the compartments of the body at different pH values, and also, it is the versatile parameter to improve the pharmacokinetic {{properties of}} a new molecule in a particular family of drugs. In the present thesis work, the microspeciation of three molecules of great pharmaceutical importance and unusual acid-base properties, were carried out. The microconstants of tenoxicam, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, were described, introducing a novel deductive method using Hammett constants. For this purpose, a total of 8 tenoxicam and piroxicam derivatives were synthesised. To the best of our knowledge, the O logk N microconstant of tenoxicam obtained thus is the lowest enolate basicity value, which, however, can be well explained by the effects of the intramolecular environment. The developed evaluation procedure is suitable for microconstant determination of compounds in other molecule families. Besides, prodrug-type compounds and analogues similar to the structures of selective COX- 2 isoenzyme inhibitors were synthesised. The other two molecules studied, the 6 -aminopenicillanic acid and 7 -cephalosporanic acid, the core molecules of the two most important beta-lactam antibiotic-types were derivatised and investigated by 1 D and 2 D NMR techniques.

These calixnaphthalenes were prepared by either one-pot or convergent procedures. [...] Calixnaphthalenes offer some advantages over the calixarenes. For example, since the naphthalene unit is larger than benzene the cavity of "cone conformations" of the corresponding calixnaphthalenes should be deeper. Also, the presence of a B ring in naphthalene provides a site for the addition of different functional groups, which allow calixnaphthalenes to be modified. Furthermore, due to the low symmetry of 1 –naphthol and 3 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthoic acid, some calixnaphthalenes can be inherently chiral.

[...] Calix[4]naphthalenes 10 - 12 were synthesized first by the direct condensation of 1 - naphthol and formaldehyde under basic conditions. Due to the difficulty in the separationand purification of these compounds, a convergent approach was used to synthesize these compounds as well as 13 in larger amounts for further investigations. The calix[4]- naphthalenes are conformationally flexible at room temperature even after their derivatization as tetraester derivatives. [...] In order to synthesize calixnaphthalenes which are closer to calixarenes in the location of the hydroxyl groups within the lower rim of the calixnaphthalene basket, a retrosynthetic analysis of compounds 57 and 62 showed that 3 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthoic acid (9) would be a suitable starting material.

However, these free olive oil biophenols are scarcely soluble in lipid media, which limited their used as antioxidant additives in based lipids foods. For this reason, the search for new derivatives that could maintain the functional characteristics of the original compounds, with enhanced lipophilicity and, therefore, intestinal bioavailability, is convenient. In this sense, synthesis of several lipophilic derivatives from olive oil phenols have been already published [5 ¿ 9].

40|$|Nitrogen and lipids are key {{nutrients}} of {{grape must}} {{that influence the}} production of fermentative aromas by wine yeast, and we have previously shown that a strong interaction exists between these two nutrients. However, more than 90 % of the acids and higher alcohols (and <b>their</b> acetate <b>ester</b> <b>derivatives)</b> were derived from intermediates produced by the carbon central metabolism (CCM). The objective {{of this study was}} to determine how variations in nitrogen and lipid resources can modulate the contribution of nitrogen and carbon metabolisms for the production of fermentative aromas. A quantitative analysis of metabolism using 13 C-labelled leucine and valine showed that nitrogen availability affected the part of the catabolism of N-containing compounds, the formation of α-ketoacids from CCM and the redistribution of fluxes around these precursors, explaining the optimum production of higher alcohols occurring at an intermediate nitrogen content. Moreover, nitrogen content modulated the total production of acids and higher alcohols differently, through variations in the redox state of cells. We also demonstrated that the phytosterol content, modifying the intracellular availability of acetyl-CoA, can influence the flux distribution, especially the formation of higher alcohols and the conversion of α-ketoisovalerate to α-ketoisocaproate...|$|R

40|$|Convenient {{preparation}} of picolinyl derivatives from fatty acid esters It {{is essential to}} have simple rapid methods for the determination of fatty acid struc-tures. Traditionally, fatty acids are analysed by gas chromatography using <b>their</b> methyl <b>ester</b> <b>derivatives</b> (FAME). However, <b>their</b> correspondingmass spectra exhibit molecular ions but are usually devoid of ions indicative of structural features and, notably, the position of double bounds on the aliphatic chains [1]. In the most useful approach to structure determination, the carboxyl group is derivatised with a reagent containing a nitrogen atom. Recently, a convenient method for preparing picolinyl esters from intact lipids has been published [2]. However, some problems occurred in our laboratory when this method was used, leading to some modifications and optimisation. Thus, hexane and water have been added while sodium bicarbonate has been removed in order to lower contamination. Temperature and length of the reaction have then been optimised {{in order to get}} 100 % derivatisation for different kinds of lipids (45 7 C and 45 min for FAME). Finally, a comparison of the response factors has confirmed the better sensitivity of the picolinyl derivative against FAME (five times more) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{conformational}} preferences of L-aspartic acid dimethyl ester (AspOMe) and its N-acetylated derivative (AcAspOMe) were evaluated through spectroscopic data and theoretical calculations. Unlike amino acids, <b>their</b> corresponding amino <b>ester</b> <b>derivatives</b> do not exhibit a zwitterionic structure and are soluble in most organic solvents, enabling their studies in these media. Thus, the conformers of AspOMe and AcAspOMe were theoretically determined both in isolated phase and in solution (IEF-PCM model) at the omega B 97 X-D/aug-cc-pVTZ level. A joint {{analysis of the}} experimental and theoretical (3) J(HH) coupling constants in several aprotic solvents allowed assigning the most stable conformers, showing excellent agreement between these approaches. Also, IR spectroscopy allowed us to obtain quantitative data on AcAspOMe conformer populations in different solvents. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis indicated that both steric and hyperconjugative contributions count in determining the relative conformer stabilities of these compounds. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding, characterized by Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) and Non-Covalent Interactions (NCI) methodologies, represents only a secondary factor to drive the stabilities of AspOMe and AcAspOMe conformers...|$|R
40|$|Background: Eruca is {{a native}} plant genus of the South Europe and central Asia {{where it has been}} {{cultivated}} since centuries.

Materials and Methods: In this study, our aim was to investigate the effect of sowing periods (autumn and spring) and three forms of the nitrogen-containing fertilizers (manure, calcium nitrate [Ca(NO 3) 2, 15. 5 &#x 0025; N], and ammonium sulphate [(NH 4) 2 SO 4, 21 &#x 0025; N]) on fatty acid compositions of the oils obtained from Eruca sativa Mill. seeds cultivated. All oils were obtained by maceration of the seeds with n -hexane at room temperature and converted to <b>their</b> methyl <b>ester</b> <b>derivatives</b> by trans-methylesterification reaction using boron-trifluorur (BF 3). The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) in the oils were detected by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results: All the samples analyzed were found to contain quite high amounts of erucic acid ranging between 46. 64 - 54. 79 &#x 0025;, followed by oleic (17. 86 - 19. 95 &#x 0025;), palmitic (7. 25 - 10. 97 &#x 0025;), linoleic (4. 23 - 9. 72 &#x 0025;), and linolenic (1. 98 - 3. 01 &#x 0025;) acids.
