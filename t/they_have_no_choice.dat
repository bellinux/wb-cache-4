25|$|People are slotted into {{functions}} {{insofar as}} they have characteristics which are at least compatible with the functions. They always have a choice in how they perform their role and how they act it out, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> about taking it on. If they succeed in their role, they can advance their position or career, but {{if they fail to}} live up to it, they are demoted or fired. Human individuality is then conceptualized in terms of the relationship between buyer and seller.|$|E
25|$|The group {{now faces}} the {{additional}} burden {{of having to}} take care of a baby and a dog. They initially try to give Karli to another family on the island, but no-one is willing to take him in. As the group realize <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to take Karli with them, Sigurd finally catches up after having chased them for 16 days. Thorfinn distracts Sigurd by lying to him that Gudrid already died at sea. However, as he is lamenting his failure, Sigurd spots Gudrid and Full-Eyes climbing up a hill. Enraged, Sigurd gives chase but Gudrid and Full-Eyes escape by jumping from the cliff into the sea and swimming to the ship. In order to shake off Sigurd, Leif decides to sail further north.|$|E

50|$|The {{first issue}} {{appeared}} {{with a cover}} date of November-December 1955. Crime Illustrated ran {{for a total of}} two issues.

40|$|After the two-decade {{economic}} reform, the Chinese rural workers enjoy {{much more}} freedom of choosing their occupations among household farming, local non-farm employed job, local non-farm self-employment and migration, whereas before the late 1970 ’s <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but collectivised farming. Under these circumstances...|$|R
500|$|In another famous scene Lady Fidget's self-styled [...] "virtuous gang" [...] meet up at Horner's lodging to carouse, {{throw off}} their public virtue, and behave exactly like male rakes, singing riotous songs and {{drinking}} defiant toasts. Finally {{each of the}} ladies triumphantly declares that Horner himself is the very lover they have been toasting, and a mayhem of jealousy breaks out as they realise that their friends have also been receiving Horner's favours. But they quickly realise <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to keep the scandalous secret: [...] "Well then, there's no remedy, sister sharers, let us not fall out, but have a care of our honour" [...] (V.iv.169).|$|E
500|$|They find a small structure, {{and from}} its top the woman spots people. As {{they leave the}} structure, they think of their sand castle, {{wondering}} about its fate. The screen flashes to a scene of a lone bucket floating on a body of water, then flashes back. After a bit more traveling, the characters make contact with three androgynous people wearing headgear. The woman attempts to communicate, but the native language of the people is incomprehensible. She shows them her wound, and they treat it with a paste. The group then beckon {{the man and woman}} to follow them into town. After receiving water, the man and woman sleep. The following morning, the man communicates with one of the locals by drawing pictures in the dirt. The local informs that the sea level is, in fact, rising, and that the two characters should follow and see someone to talk to. They rest while on the way, where the man and woman look over a map from one of the locals. They continue to a city, and a castle behind it. They are led to the natives' leader, who, speaking the language of the protagonists poorly, explains the reason for the sea rising. She reveals that her people had erected a berm to keep what she calls [...] "the planet's mightiest river" [...] at bay, which is presently days away from breaking through and flooding the man and woman's home. She explains that the journey back to reach their home to warn the others living there would take too long and that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to remain with the mountain people. Ignoring her, the man and woman flee and run back home, taking some of the mountain people's provisions on the way out and guiding themselves with maps that the woman had stolen.|$|E
500|$|... is a blonde-haired {{girl who}} is the fourth Mew Mew {{introduced}} to the readers and {{the youngest of the}} bunch. Infused with the DNA of a Golden Lion Tamarin, Bu-Ling grows a monkey tail and ears while transformed, and fights with a pair of rings. Bu-Ling is introduced as being a busker due to her acrobatic skills to earn money for her family. The other Mew Mews agree that her monkey DNA is a perfect match for her personality as she is full of energy and loves having fun, to the point Minto considers her very immature or childish. A running gag when it comes to referencing the Mew Mews' DNA had Bu-Ling thinking that her DNA is a lion where she is always corrected that she has the DNA of a Golden Lion Tamarin. Despite her age, Bu-Ling is raising her five younger siblings and managing the family finances while their father is training in the mountains. The manga never mentions Bu-Ling's mother while the anime adaptation states that she died. Midway through the series, Bu-Ling befriends Tart when he captures her and holds her hostage. She is reluctant to fight Tart during the final battle until he affirms <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice,</b> and cries over him after he is defeated. Bu-Ling kisses Tart {{at the end of the}} series and tells him she does not want it [...] "to be goodbye." [...] He replies by saying that he may return to see her. In the anime adaptation, the relationship between Bu-Ling and Tart is expanded and the circumstances of their initial friendship changes– instead of being saved by the Mew Mews, Tart himself saves Bu-Ling from an underground cavern when he realizes that she is suffocating from a lack of oxygen.|$|E
60|$|With {{these words}} he vanished, leaving the courtiers sadly perplexed; but as all {{their efforts to}} find the Prince were useless <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to go home, {{bringing}} with them the sad news, which so greatly distressed the King that he fell ill and died not long after.|$|R
50|$|With his changed attitude, all {{the villagers}} {{and his friends}} became afraid of him. Left with <b>no</b> <b>choice,</b> the village got a group of brave warriors {{together}} and they plan to eliminate Monsopiad.

50|$|Under Charles I, Calvinist teachings were {{undermined}} {{and bishops}} became less tolerant of Puritan views and {{more willing to}} enforce the use of controversial ceremonies. New controls were placed on Puritan preaching, and some ministers were suspended or removed from their livings. Increasingly, many Puritans concluded that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to emigrate.|$|R
2500|$|Often {{girls who}} take racy photos of {{themselves}} [...] "want to be admired, {{want someone to}} want them. A {{lot of them are}} lonely and starved for attention. A lot of girls believe <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to pose in this way. There are also the thrill seekers who do it because it's 'edgy and cool.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|One party aggressively pursues a set {{of terms}} {{to the point where}} the other {{negotiating}} party must either agree or walk away. Brinkmanship is a type of [...] "hard nut" [...] approach to bargaining in which one party pushes the other party to the [...] "brink" [...] or edge of what that party is willing to accommodate. [...] Successful brinksmanship convinces the other party <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to accept the offer and there is no acceptable alternative to the proposed agreement.|$|E
2500|$|Critics of {{marriage}} {{argue that it}} is an institution which contributes to the maintaining of traditional gender roles, thus preventing women from achieving social equality, and reinforcing the idea that women exist to serve men, which in turn increases the abuse of women. They argue that marriage reinforces the traditional paradigm of male-female interaction: subordination of the woman to the man in exchange of subsistence. According to Sheila Jeffreys [...] "the traditional elements {{of marriage}} have not completely disappeared in western societies, even in the case of employed, highly educated and well paid professional women". She argues that even such women remain in abusive marriages out of fear of leaving and out of duty. Even in Western countries, married women [...] "feel <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to stay and endure and may be 'loving to survive".|$|E
50|$|Following the Qibya massacre, Yeshayahu Leibowitz {{questioned}} the moral character of {{operations of the}} Israeli army. He points out that at the contrary {{of the time of}} diaspora, Jews established in Israel have the possibility to resort to force and that if in 1948 <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice,</b> at Qibya the Israeli nation showed his moral limits.|$|R
50|$|Panzer and Davis {{were hoping}} that Peckinpah would re-edit the film himself, {{because they did}} not desire to antagonize him any further, but the {{director}} refused to make changes. Peckinpah had also filmed several satirical scenes, subtly ridiculing the product. As a result, the producers felt <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> and effectively fired Peckinpah and re-edited the film themselves.|$|R
50|$|Several other countries, however, {{were drawn}} into the {{conflict}} at this time. By September 28, 1939, the three Baltic Republics felt <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to permit Soviet bases and troops on their territory. The Baltic Republics were occupied by the Soviet army in June 1940, and finally annexed to the Soviet Union in August 1940.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{there is}} a growing body of Modern Orthodox and {{national}} religious rabbis who encourage visits to certain parts of the Mount, which they believe are permitted according to most medieval rabbinical authorities. These rabbis include: Shlomo Goren (former Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel); Chaim David Halevi (former Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv and Yaffo); Dov Lior (Rabbi of Kiryat Arba); Yosef Elboim; Yisrael Ariel; She'ar Yashuv Cohen (Chief Rabbi of Haifa); Yuval Sherlo (rosh yeshiva of the hesder yeshiva of Petah Tikva); Meir Kahane. One of them, Shlomo Goren, held that it is possible that Jews are even allowed to enter the heart of the Dome of the Rock in time of war, according to Jewish Law of Conquest. These authorities demand an attitude of veneration on the part of Jews ascending the Temple Mount, ablution in a mikveh prior to the ascent, and the wearing of non-leather shoes. Some rabbinic authorities are now of the opinion that it is imperative for Jews to ascend in order to halt the ongoing process of Islamization of the Temple Mount. Maimonides, perhaps the greatest codifier of Jewish Law, wrote in Laws of the Chosen House ch 7 Law 15 [...] "One may bring a dead body in to the (lower sanctified areas of the) Temple Mount and {{there is no need to}} say that the ritually impure (from the dead) may enter there, because the dead body itself can enter". One who is ritually impure through direct or in-direct contact of the dead cannot walk in the higher sanctified areas. For those who are visibly Jewish, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice,</b> [...] as it has become unofficially part of the status quo on the Mount. Many of these recent opinions rely on archaeological evidence.|$|E

There is a perfect rush of young men to the Prefecture, to obtain places in the clothing, medical, arming, and equipping departments; in any sort of service, in fact, which will exempt its holder from taking up arms.|$|E
60|$|In some {{countries}} {{possessed of a}} small territory, and consisting perhaps chiefly {{of one or two}} large cities, it never can be made a question, whether or not they should freely import foreign corn. They exist, in fact, by this importation; and being always, in point of population, inconsiderable, they may, in general, rely upon a pretty regular supply. But whether regular or not, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice.</b> Nature has clearly told them, that if they increase in wealth and power to any extent, it can only be by living upon the raw produce of other countries.|$|E

50|$|During Watterson's first sabbatical {{from the}} strip, Universal Press Syndicate {{continued}} to charge newspapers full price to re-run old Calvin and Hobbes strips.

6000|$|But {{he found}} it much more {{difficult}} to obtain comfort when he weighed the arguments brought forward against the abominations of such a borough as that for which he sat, and reflected that if Mr. Turnbull brought forward his clause, he, Phineas Finn, would be bound to vote against the clause, knowing the clause to be right, because he was a servant of the Government. The arguments, even though they appeared in the People's Banner, were true arguments; and he had on one occasion admitted their truth to his friend Lady Laura,--in the presence of that great Cabinet Minister, her husband. [...] "What business has such a man as that down there? Is there a single creature who wants him?" [...] Lady Laura had said. [...] "I don't suppose anybody does want Mr. Quintus Slide," [...] Phineas had replied; [...] "but I am disposed to think the electors should choose the man they do want, and that at present <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> left to them." [...] "They are quite satisfied," [...] said Lady Laura, angrily. [...] "Then, Lady Laura," [...] continued Phineas, [...] "that alone should be sufficient to prove that their privilege of returning a member to Parliament is too much for them. We can't defend it." [...] "It is defended by tradition," [...] said Mr. Kennedy. [...] "And by its great utility," [...] said Lady Laura, bowing to the young member who was present, and forgetting that very useless old gentleman, her cousin, who had sat for the borough for many years. [...] "In this country it doesn't do to go too fast," [...] said Mr. Kennedy. [...] "And then the mixture of vulgarity, falsehood, and pretence!" [...] said Lady Laura, shuddering as her mind recurred to the fact that Mr. Quintus Slide had contaminated Loughton by his presence. [...] "I am told that they hardly let him leave the place alive." ...|$|E
