40|$|This paper sets up an options-based {{model of}} the {{exchange}} rate in a <b>target</b> <b>zone</b> <b>system</b> according to which the observed exchange rate is equivalent to a floating exchange rate adjusted with the value of two options. The strike prices of the options are {{the limits of the}} band, but the two options are interrelated which complicates their evaluation. Within this framework, the direct effect of the band rearrangement on the exchange rate can be measured by the change of the option prices caused by the change of the strike prices. We apply this options-based model to analyze the depreciation of the forint in the summer of 2003. Depreciation is decomposed into (a) the direct effect of the band-shift; (b) changing expectations relating the final conversation rate in the EMU; and (c) changing uncertainty. Exchange rate changes of some European currencies due to band rearrangements is also analyzed. <b>target</b> <b>zone</b> <b>system,</b> options, option pricing, target zone rearrangement, band-shift, band widening. ...|$|E

In a <b>target</b> <b>zone</b> <b>system</b> like the ERM, interest rate differentials mainly reflect devaluation expectations, which are measured here by raw 1 -month Euromarket interest rate differentials, drift-adjusted 1 -month differentials, and differentials in long-term government bond yields. The role of a large set of fundamental macroeconomic variables that may have affected these devaluation expectations is investigated within a vector autoregressive (VAR) setting, by means of Granger-causality tests, impulse-response functions and variance decompositions. We find no evidence that fundamentals are more relevant to drift-adjusted devaluation risk than for unadjusted interest rate differentials. A significant impact of inflation, budget deficits, and unemployment becomes evident for almost all ERM-participants. ...|$|E

Yet over fifteen years have elapsed since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods System without any serious efforts to restore {{fixed exchange}} rates among the currencies of the major industrial countries.

The first section of the paper examines the principal problem which exchange rate policy is designed to address, exchange rate variability. The paper distinguishes between the short run volatility of exchange rates, which firms can hedge against in the financial markets, and longer term swings in real exchange rates, which can lead to costly resource reallocation. The paper reviews evidence concerning the effectiveness of exchange market intervention, evidence which suggests that intervention may not be effective unless it is monetized. The paper goes on to analyze arguments concerning fixed exchange rates, and to assess the experience of two fixed rate systems, Bretton Woods and the European Monetary System.

In an attempt to reconcile the poor empirical performance of the Krugman (1991) model with the reality of exchange rate <b>target</b> <b>zone</b> regimes, this line of research integrates <b>target</b> <b>zones</b> with alternative underlying economic models, such as imperfect credibility, intra-marginal interventions and sticky price models.

This implies that the initial emphasis of <b>target</b> <b>zone</b> models on nonlinearities, “honeymoon effect”, “smooth pasting” and marginal interventions has vanished.

By using Bayesian time-varying parameter regression, the present paper shows that stochastic devaluation risk actually explains EMS data quite well. Three key findings should be stressed. First, estimates of expected devaluation rates have recently declined significantly, but devaluation risk has not yet been completely eliminated. Second, expected devaluation rates display `hysteresis'. This contaminates many of the relationships postulated by <b>target</b> <b>zone</b> models with noise, but adjusting for expected devaluation rates frequently reveals almost noise-free relationships, which strongly supports the predictions of the theory.
