5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law, as the court has to judge <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> of a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.|$|E

5000|$|This was {{despite the}} fact that <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> order effect had been {{depressing}} electricity spot prices. <b>The</b> <b>merit</b> order effect occurs when preferentially dispatched wind and photovoltaic generation displaces more expensive fossil fuel generation from the margin - often gas-fired combined cycle plant - thereby driving down the cleared price. This effect is more pronounced for photovoltaics because their midday peak correlates with the maximum generation requirement on <b>the</b> system. <b>The</b> <b>merit</b> order effect also lowers the revenues for conventional power plants and makes them less economically viable. A 2007 study finds that [...] "in the case of the year 2006, the volume of <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> order effect exceeds the volume of the net support payments for renewable electricity generation which have to be paid by consumers".

5|$|By {{recasting}} {{a difference}} of judgment over <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> of the early work on the hydrogen bomb project into {{a matter of a}} security risk, Teller effectively damned Oppenheimer in a field where security was necessarily of paramount concern.

5|$|Chabon's work is {{characterized}} by complex language, the frequent use of metaphor along with recurring themes, including nostalgia, divorce, abandonment, fatherhood, and most notably issues of Jewish identity.

Since the late 1990s, Chabon has written in an increasingly diverse series of styles for varied outlets; he is a notable defender of <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> of genre fiction and plot-driven fiction, and, along with novels, he has published screenplays, children's books, comics, and newspaper serials.|$|E
5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they act or make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of judicial review. On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in judicial review of administrative action to scrutinize the legality and not <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> of the decisions of public authorities.|$|E
50|$|The current honours system {{came about}} on 25 August 1999 {{with the passage}} of AN ACT to repeal <b>the</b> <b>Merit</b> Act 1992/1993, No. 3 and to {{consolidate}} the system for the conferring of awards in recognition of meritorious service to Samoa or acts of bravery. also known by its short title as the Honours and Awards Act 1999. This act did away with all of the awards of <b>the</b> <b>Merit</b> Act 1992/1993, but left in place many of the mechanisms for administering and awarding its honours. Among them is the retaining of <b>the</b> <b>Merit</b> Board, but renaming it the Honours and Awards Committee.

There is a further section that states any honours not attached to <b>the</b> <b>Merit</b> Act 1992/1993 are also still valid and maintain their status and recognition. Monetary awards are limited to only the top two gallantry awards under the act of 1999.|$|R

5|$|Lloyd George agreed {{it might}} be {{acceptable}} to the British electorate.
