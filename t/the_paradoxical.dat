5|$|Divided {{into five}} stanzas of ten lines each, the ode {{contains}} a narrator's discourse {{on a series}} of designs on a Grecian urn. The poem focuses on two scenes: one in which a lover eternally pursues a beloved without fulfilment, and another of villagers about to perform a sacrifice. The final lines of the poem declare that beauty is truth, truth beauty,' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know", and literary critics have debated whether they increase or diminish the overall beauty of the poem. Critics have focused on other aspects of the poem, including the role of the narrator, the inspirational qualities of real-world objects, and <b>the</b> <b>paradoxical</b> relationship between the poem's world and reality.|$|E

25|$|Finally, connect {{every point}} on S2 with a ray to the origin; <b>the</b> <b>paradoxical</b> {{decomposition}} of S2 then yields a paradoxical decomposition {{of the solid}} unit ball minus the point at the ball's center (this center point needs a bit more care, see below).|$|E
25|$|A {{satisfactory}} resolution {{should also}} explain why there naively {{appears to be}} a paradox. Solutions that accept <b>the</b> <b>paradoxical</b> conclusion can do this by presenting a proposition that we intuitively know to be false but that is easily confused with (PC), while solutions that reject (EC) or (NC) should present a proposition that we intuitively know to be true but that is easily confused with (EC) or (NC).|$|E

25|$|This {{result is}} often {{encountered}} in social-science and medical-science statistics and is particularly problematic when frequency data is unduly given causal interpretations. <b>The</b> <b>paradoxical</b> elements disappear when causal relations are brought into consideration.

25|$|The series raises, explores, {{and offers}} fresh {{insights}} about ethical and moral issues emerging from <b>the</b> <b>paradoxical</b> {{nature of a}} counterterrorism organization which resorts to terrorist methods to succeed in its own ostensibly altruistic goals, and the attendant dilemmas in which the generally unwilling operatives in such an organization find themselves. Nikita's unwavering belief {{in a kind of}} moral absolutism (as opposed to Section One's prescribed philosophy of situational ethics) consistently and coherently motivates the underlying dramatic plot conflicts in the majority of the episodes.|$|E
25|$|Using this Carnapian approach, Maher {{identifies}} {{a proposition}} which we intuitively (and correctly) {{know to be}} false, but which we easily confuse with <b>the</b> <b>paradoxical</b> conclusion. The proposition in question is the proposition that observing non-ravens tells us about the color of ravens. While this is intuitively false and is also false according to Carnap's theory of induction, observing non-ravens (according to that same theory) causes us to reduce our estimate {{of the total number}} of ravens, and thereby reduces the estimated number of possible counterexamples to the rule that all ravens are black.|$|E
30|$|An {{interesting}} question arises: Why would a dependent man murder his own wife? <b>The</b> answer is <b>paradoxical.</b> <b>The</b> {{fear of being}} alone, if the wife wants to separate, drives the 'Subject' to murder. His abandonment anxiety is so vital that, when his wife leaves him, his nightmares are realized. The 'Subject' also feels an inconsistency in his self, because his wife was {{a significant part of}} his own self-image. We claim that <b>the</b> answer is <b>paradoxical,</b> because it is his very action that causes him to be left absolutely alone. Such men explain that, by murdering the wife who wanted to leave, they are actually preserving or freezing the relationship as it was before she left.|$|R

25|$|Thus, the Dirac Hamiltonian is {{fundamentally}} distinguished from its classical counterpart, {{and we must}} take great care to correctly identify what is observable in this theory.

Ngapartji Ngapartji, by Scott Rankin and Trevor Jamieson, recounts the story of the effects on the Pitjantjatjara people of nuclear testing in the Western Desert during the Cold War.

25|$|AR gene {{mutations}} in the LBD that alter ligand specificity and/or functional activity exist and {{are thought to}} contribute to the conversion of some AR antagonists into agonists, which explains <b>the</b> <b>paradoxical</b> temporary improvement sometimes observed in patients when antiandrogen therapy is stopped. These mutations can have great effect on the antagonist activities of current small molecule antiandrogens and make them less efficient in blocking AR function via indirect modulation from inside of the LBP. Recent studies with circulating tumor cells, suggest that the mutation frequency is higher than previously assumed based on tumor biopsies.|$|E
25|$|In Step 3, {{the sphere}} was {{partitioned}} into orbits {{of our group}} H. To streamline the proof, the discussion of points that are fixed by some rotation was omitted; since <b>the</b> <b>paradoxical</b> decomposition of F2 relies on shifting certain subsets, {{the fact that some}} points are fixed might cause some trouble. Since any rotation of S2 (other than the null rotation) has exactly two fixed points, and since H, which is isomorphic to F2, is countable, there are countably many points of S2 that are fixed by some rotation in H, denote this set of fixed points D. Step 3 proves that S2 − D admits a paradoxical decomposition.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>paradoxical</b> {{aspect of}} the twins' {{situation}} arises {{from the fact that}} at any given moment the travelling twin's clock is running slow in the earthbound twin's inertial frame, but based on the relativity principle one could equally argue that the earthbound twin's clock is running slow in the travelling twin's inertial frame. One proposed resolution is that the earthbound twin is at rest in the same inertial frame throughout the journey, while the travelling twin is not: in the simplest version of the thought-experiment, the travelling twin switches at the midpoint of the trip from being at rest in an inertial frame with velocity in one direction (away from the earth) to being at rest in an inertial frame with velocity in the opposite direction (towards the earth).|$|E
25|$|Aschenbach boards a gondola for Venice {{and sings}} of its beauty. He realises and mocks his own {{resemblance}} to the Elderly Fop. Upon seeing the Polish family ahead of him, Aschenbach follows distractedly. Tadzio detaches himself from the family and waits for Aschenbach, who turns away when the boy looks directly at him. Aschenbach is pleased to notice that Tadzio does not betray his follower's presence to his mother. Alone again, Aschenbach buys strawberries from a street seller, but finds them musty and over-ripe. He sits down, tired and ill, and bitterly mocks himself ("Self-discipline your strength... All folly, all pretence"). He recites a paraphrase of Plato's dialogue between the old philosopher Socrates and the boy Phaedrus, speaking the parts of both man and boy. The subject of the dialogue is <b>the</b> <b>paradoxical,</b> dangerous relationship between the artist and his subject.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, in the Banach–Tarski paradox {{the number of}} pieces is finite and the allowed equivalences are Euclidean congruences, which {{preserve}} the volumes. Yet, somehow, they end up doubling {{the volume of the}} ball! While this is certainly surprising, some of the pieces used in <b>the</b> <b>paradoxical</b> decomposition are non-measurable sets, so the notion of volume (more precisely, Lebesgue measure) is not defined for them, and the partitioning cannot be accomplished in a practical way. In fact, the Banach–Tarski paradox demonstrates {{that it is impossible to}} find a finitely-additive measure (or a Banach measure) defined on all subsets of a Euclidean space of three (and greater) dimensions that is invariant with respect to Euclidean motions and takes the value one on a unit cube. In his later work, Tarski showed that, conversely, non-existence of paradoxical decompositions of this type implies the existence of a finitely-additive invariant measure.|$|E
