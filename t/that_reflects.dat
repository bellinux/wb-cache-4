5|$|A nocturnal animal, the Bengal slow loris has {{excellent}} night vision, {{enhanced by}} a tapetum lucidum—a layer of {{tissue in the}} eye <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> visible light back through the retina. It sleeps during the day {{curled up in a}} ball in dense vegetation or in tree holes. Males and females mark their territory with urine. The species is known to live in small family groups. Animals may practice social grooming.|$|E

5|$|Certain Christian groups, {{most notably}} those in some King James Only denominations, {{consider}} {{all types of}} rock and metal music to be opposition to their faith, regardless of lyrical content or the lifestyles of the band members. However, fans and artists see metal as another genre of music, parallel to such genres as blues, classical, jazz, punk, and hip-hop. Bands such as Showbread and Antestor believe that the instrumentation of the music is simply a medium of art, while the person creating the music {{as well as the}} lyrics being presented provide the message. Therefore, Christian metal is created when Christians compose metal music in a way <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> their faith in Christ.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{aspects of}} the {{negotiations}} leading to {{the transfer of the}} codex to the Tsar's possession are open to an interpretation <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> adversely on Tischendorf's candour and good faith with the monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery. For a recent account intended to exculpate him of blame, see Erhard Lauch's article 'Nichts gegen Tischendorf' in Bekenntnis zur Kirche: Festgabe für Ernst Sommerlath zum 70. Geburtstag (Berlin, c. 1961); for an account that includes a hitherto unknown receipt given by Tischendorf to the authorities at the monastery promising to return the manuscript from Saint Petersburg 'to the Holy Confraternity of Sinai at its earliest request'.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the mammals were {{comprehensively}} revised by Malcolm C. McKenna and Susan K. Bell, {{which has}} resulted in the McKenna/Bell classification. Their 1997 book, Classification of Mammals above the Species Level, is a comprehensive work on the systematics, relationships and occurrences of all mammal taxa, living and extinct, down through the rank of genus, though molecular genetic data challenge several of the higher level groupings. The authors worked together as paleontologists at the American Museum of Natural History, New York. McKenna inherited the project from Simpson and, with Bell, constructed a completely updated hierarchical system, covering living and extinct taxa <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> the historical genealogy of Mammalia.|$|E

5|$|Months {{before each}} Games, the Olympic Flame is lit in Olympia in a {{ceremony}} <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess, ignites a torch by placing it inside a parabolic mirror which focuses the sun's rays; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer, thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that will carry the flame to the host city's Olympic stadium, where it {{plays an important role}} in the opening ceremony. Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since 1928, the torch relay was only introduced at the 1936 Summer Games to promote the Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} influences on History of a Six Weeks' Tour was Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796), written by Mary Shelley's mother Mary Wollstonecraft. A travel narrative <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> on topography, politics, society, aesthetics, and the author's personal feelings, it provided a model for Mary Shelley's work. Like her mother, Mary Shelley revealed her liberalism by boldly discussing politics; however, this political tone was unusual for travel works at the time and was considered inappropriate for women writers. Like Wollstonecraft's Letters, History of a Six Weeks' Tour blurs the line between private and public spheres by using intimate genres such as the journal and the letter, allowing Mary Shelley to present political opinions through personal anecdote and the picturesque.|$|E
5|$|Samantha convinces Theodore {{to go on}} a {{blind date}} with a woman (Olivia Wilde), with whom a friend, Lewman (Luka Jones), has been trying to set him up. The date goes well, but Theodore hesitates to promise when he will see her again, so she insults him and leaves. Theodore {{mentions}} this to Samantha, and they talk about relationships. Theodore explains that, although he and Amy (Amy Adams) dated briefly in college, they are only good friends, and that Amy is married. Theodore and Samantha's intimacy grows through a verbal sexual encounter. They develop a relationship <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> positively in Theodore's writing and well-being, and in Samantha's enthusiasm to grow and learn.|$|E

Two-page book embedding has also been used to find simultaneous embeddings of graphs, in which two graphs are given on the same vertex set and one must find a placement for the vertices in which both graphs are drawn planarly with straight edges.|$|E
5|$|I {{think when}} you name a record, {{you have to choose}} {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E
5|$|Like {{some other}} cephalopods, bigfin reef squids {{are capable of}} metachrosis – rapidly {{changing}} body colouration and patterns through voluntary control of chromatophores. They also possess iridophores (particularly in the head), a form of structural colouration that produces iridescent metallic greens and red when illuminated. They are also possibly one of two squid species with leucophores. Leucophores are a reflector-type structural colouration <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> ambient light, such that they are white in white light, green in green light, and so on. Bigfin reef squids are remarkable for having the ability to produce complex body patterns {{from the moment they}} hatch. In comparison, other loliginid squid species do not produce complex body patterns at less than four months of age. The patterns produced by bigfin reef squids, however, are less diverse than those of the Caribbean reef squids.|$|E

5|$|Motif finding, {{also known}} as profile analysis, is a method of {{locating}} sequence motifs in global MSAs that is both a means of producing a better MSA and a means of producing a scoring matrix for use in searching other sequences for similar motifs. A variety of methods for isolating the motifs have been developed, but {{all are based on}} identifying short highly conserved patterns within the larger alignment and constructing a matrix similar to a substitution matrix <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> the amino acid or nucleotide composition of each position in the putative motif. The alignment can then be refined using these matrices. In standard profile analysis, the matrix includes entries for each possible character as well as entries for gaps. Alternatively, statistical pattern-finding algorithms can identify motifs as a precursor to an MSA rather than as a derivation. In many cases when the query set contains {{only a small number of}} sequences or contains only highly related sequences, pseudocounts are added to normalize the distribution reflected in the scoring matrix. In particular, this corrects zero-probability entries in the matrix to values that are small but nonzero.|$|E
5|$|The Gospel of the Hebrews is {{preserved}} in fragments quoted or summarized by various early Church Fathers. The {{full extent of}} the original gospel is unknown; according to a list of canonical and apocryphal works drawn up in the 9th century known as the Stichometry of Nicephorus, the gospel was 2200 lines, just 300 lines shorter than Matthew. Based on the surviving fragments, the overall structure of the gospel appears to have been similar to the canonical ones. It consisted of a narrative of the life of Jesus which included his baptism, temptation, transfiguration, last supper, crucifixion, and resurrection. The gospel also contained sayings of Jesus. The events in the life of Jesus have been interpreted in a way <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> Jewish ideas present in a Hellenistic cultural environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{balance between}} the {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD/NADH ratio. This ratio {{is an important component}} of what is called the redox state of a cell, a measurement <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> both the metabolic activities and the health of cells. The effects of the NAD/NADH ratio are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio between free NAD and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; the ratio is thus favourable for oxidative reactions. The ratio of total NAD/NADH is much lower, with estimates ranging from 3–10 in mammals. In contrast, the NADP/NADPH ratio is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH.|$|E
30|$|The Sr and REE abundances of six {{matrices}} in five CV 3 chondrites were measured. The {{correlations between}} the Sr, La and Ca abundances of the matrices suggest that Sr and LREEs would have been redistributed in the MET 00430 and MET 01070 matrices during aqueous alteration in their parent body. Only the LAP 02206 and RBT 04143 matrices would preserve the LREE abundances <b>that</b> <b>reflect</b> nebular processes. The {{correlations between the}} Sr, LREE and Ca abundances of matrices will be useful for distinguishing CV 3 matrices with Sr and LREE abundances <b>that</b> <b>reflect</b> nebular processes from those <b>that</b> <b>reflect</b> aqueous alteration processes in their parent body.|$|R

5|$|The {{painting}} shows a {{large room}} in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid {{during the reign of}} King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velázquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velázquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position {{similar to that of the}} viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velázquez is shown working on.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} Kronan lie {{at a depth}} of 26m (85ft), 6km (3.7mi) east of Hulterstad, off the east coast of Öland. Since her rediscovery in 1980, there have been annual diving expeditions {{to the site of the}} wreck from June to August. By Baltic Sea standards, the {{conditions}} are good for underwater archaeological work; the wreck site is far from land, away from the regular shipping lanes, and has not been affected by pollution from the land or excessive growth of marine vegetation. The visibility, especially in early summer, is good and can be up to 20m. The seabed consists of mostly infertile sand <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> much of the sunlight from the surface, aiding the surveying and documentation of the site with underwater cameras. Around 85% of the wreck site has been charted so far and Kronan has become one of the most extensive and well-publicized maritime archaeological projects in the Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through a snowy forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped short-haired woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage {{and looks up at}} it. She casts a stone against a wall <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> her like a mirror and the building collapses. In the snow, she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. She closes her eyes, plunges her hands into the body and pulls out a sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on a snowy plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood that turns to crows. Then, it is shown how the other woman was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword in the snow, then disappears into the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E
