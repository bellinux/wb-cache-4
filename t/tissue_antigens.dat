However, the detection and quantitation of these antibodies and their respective antigens have been limited to immunofluorescence or immunoprecipitation tests. In this study a more sensitive technique was used to detect heart-reactive antibody, i. e., the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis and agar gel immunodiffusion were also used to confirm the reactivity of rabbit antisera to group A streptococci and human heart tissue. Human heart <b>tissue</b> <b>antigen</b> was prepared by Triton X- 100 extraction, and checkerboard titrations of heart <b>tissue</b> <b>antigen</b> versus streptococcal antisera revealed optimal concentrations of each for the ELISA. When immune rabbit serum was reacted with heart <b>tissue</b> <b>antigen,</b> a 5 - to 10 -fold increase was observed over the reactions of preimmune sera controls. Streptococcal antiserum was found to have a six- to eightfold greater reactivity with heart <b>tissue</b> <b>antigen</b> than with similar concentrations of kidney and skeletal muscle <b>antigens.</b> Heart <b>tissue</b> <b>antigen</b> was partially purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and quantities of greater than 10 to 100 ng (dry weight) were shown to react with streptococcal antisera in the ELISA.

40|$|Summary: <b>Tissue</b> {{polypeptide}} <b>antigen,</b> {{measured by}} both a polyclonal antibody (TPA IRMA Prolifigen®) and a monoclonal antibody prototype kit (TPA-M IRMA Prolifigen®), and the <b>tissue</b> polypeptide specific <b>antigen</b> were evaluated. The markers were measured in 266 serum samples and in 291 tumour cytosols from patients with primary breast cancer. The three markers {{were available in}} matched pairs of both serum and cytosol from the same patient in 144 cases. Diagnostic sensitivity of serum levels of the three markers was not significantly different when using cut-off values calculated {{on the basis of}} healthy subjects. In the cytosol, <b>tissue</b> polypeptide <b>antigen</b> (TPA IRMA), <b>tissue</b> polypeptide <b>antigen</b> (TPA-M IRMA) and <b>tissue</b> polypeptide specific <b>antigen</b> were significantly correlated with steroid receptor Status, while their serum levels were not. Cytosol and serum levels of the three markers were not significantly associated. All three were significantly corre-lated both in serum and in cytosol. The association was closer between <b>tissue</b> polypeptide <b>antigen</b> (TPA IRMA) and <b>tissue</b> polypeptide <b>antigen</b> (TPA-M IRMA) than between each of these two markers and <b>tissue</b> polypeptide specific <b>antigen.</b> From these findings we dfäw the following conclusions: 1. <b>Tissue</b> polypeptide specific <b>antigen</b> (TPA IRMA) and <b>tissue</b> polypeptide <b>antigen</b> (TPA-M IRMA) probably provide superimposable information both in serum and in cytosol; 2. <b>Tissue</b> polypeptide specific <b>antigen</b> and <b>tissue</b> polypeptide <b>antigen</b> (TPA IRMA) or <b>tissue</b> polypeptide <b>antigen</b> (TPA^M IRMA), although closely associated, probably measure in part different cytokeratins.

The antigen {{was present in}} the serum of 68 % of the patients. Staining for <b>tissue</b> <b>antigen</b> was positive in 45 % of the patients. Non-tumorous hepatocytes alone stained positively in 22. 5 % of patients, tumour cells alone in 12. 5 % and both in 10 %. Antigen was present in relatively few tumour cells and the amounts detected were small; it was more readily detectable in moderately differentiated than in poorly differentiated malignant cells. Identical results were obtained with immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase staining, but the orcein stain failed to demonstrate the antigen in tumour cells. Cirrhosis was present in the non-tumorous liver in 70 % of the patients. Antigen was detected in cirrhotic tissue in 43 % of the patients with cirrhosis, and in non-tumorous liver tissue in 8 % of those without cirrhosis, but this difference was not significant.

5000|$|Generally, {{in normal}} (uninjured) <b>tissue,</b> <b>antigens</b> are {{taken up by}} antigen {{presenting}} cells (dendritic cells), and subsequently transported to the lymph nodes. Alternatively, soluble antigens can drain into the lymph nodes. In contrast, in the CNS, dendritic cells are not thought {{to be present in}} normal parenchymal tissue or perivascular space although they are present in the meninges and choroids plexus. [...] Thus, the CNS is thought to be limited in its capacity to deliver antigens to local lymph nodes and cause T-cell activation. [...] Although there is no conventional lymphatic system in the CNS, the drainage of antigens from CNS tissue into the cervical lymph nodes has been demonstrated. The response elicited in the lymph nodes to CNS antigens is skewed towards B-cells. Dendritic cells from cerebrospinal fluid have been found to migrate to B-cell follicles of cervical lymph nodes. The skewing of the response to antigen from the CNS towards a humoral response means that a more dangerous inflammatory T-cell response can be avoided. The induction of systemic tolerance to an antigen introduced into the CNS has been previously shown. This was seen {{in the absence of the}} T-cell mediated inflammatory [...] "delayed type hypersensitivity reaction" [...] (DTH) when the antigen was reintroduced in another part of the body.

50|$|Other {{examples}} include <b>tissue</b> differentiation <b>antigens,</b> mutant protein antigens, oncogenic viral antigens, cancer-testis antigens and vascular or stromal specific <b>antigens.</b> <b>Tissue</b> differentiation <b>antigens</b> {{are those that}} are specific to a certain type of <b>tissue.</b> Mutant protein <b>antigens</b> are likely to be much more specific to cancer cells because normal cells shouldn't contain these proteins. Normal cells will display the normal protein antigen on their MHC molecules, whereas cancer cells will display the mutant version. Some viral proteins are implicated in forming cancer (oncogenesis), and some viral antigens are also cancer antigens. Cancer-testis antigens are antigens expressed primarily in the germ cells of the testes, but also in fetal ovaries and the trophoblast. Some cancer cells aberrantly express these proteins and therefore present these antigens, allowing attack by T-cells specific to these antigens. Example antigens of this type are CTAG1B and MAGEA1.|$|R
40|$|CHANGES in the {{antigenic}} {{composition of}} the microsomal fraction of various types of cell have been demonstrated during carcinogenesis.

It has been shown that microsomal <b>tissue</b> specific <b>antigens</b> are absent in spontaneous human skin, thyroid and gastro-intestinal tumours (Nairn, Fothergill, McEntegart and Richmond, 1962; Goudie and McCallum, 1962) and in chemically-induced liver and kidney tumours in animals (Weiler, 1952, 1956). Green (1954, 1958, 1959) suggested that <b>tissue</b> specific <b>antigens,</b> originally called <b>tissue</b> identity proteins, were involved in the removal of effete or displaced cells and that in the absence of these antigenic components malignant tumours were able to invade and metastasise. This loss of <b>tissue</b> specific <b>antigens</b> was held to be the fundamental change in the induction of cancer. The present paper describes the chemical characterisation of the <b>tissue</b> specific <b>antigens</b> in the liver of Sprague Dawley rats.
