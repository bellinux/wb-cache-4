5|$|In 2014, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> and the Phillies {{met in a}} rare 5 game {{regular season}} series at Citizens Bank Park. <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> took 4 out of 5 games. Three {{straight}} games were decided in extras, with the Phillies walking off 6-5 in 14 in Game 2 and <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> winning 5-4 in 14 and 4-3 in 11 in Games 3 and 4 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The 1988 Mets {{returned}} to the playoffs, but the Phillies, who finished in sixth place in the division with a 65–96 record, beat <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> 8 times in 18 games, the third-best record against them of any team in the league. <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> won their second division title in {{three years in a}} game against the Phillies, and like two years before, did it at home. In the postseason, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> lost to the eventual champion Dodgers in the 1988 National League Championship Series.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> {{finished}} the 1999 season tied with the Cincinnati Reds for the National League wild card playoff berth. In a one-game tie-breaker, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> defeated the Reds 5–0 {{to win the}} wild card.|$|E
5000|$|Astronauts nicknamed <b>the</b> <b>MET</b> [...] "the rickshaw". It {{was pulled}} using a pulling {{bar in the}} front. The {{majority}} of the payload of <b>the</b> <b>MET</b> consisted of <b>the</b> Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP). [...] The performance of <b>the</b> <b>MET</b> was described as [...] "adequate". In fact, astronauts Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell were disappointed by <b>the</b> <b>MET's</b> performance. During one of the traverses they had to carry <b>the</b> <b>MET</b> together {{because it was too}} difficult to pull <b>the</b> <b>MET</b> through <b>the</b> rough lunar terrain.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} idea for presenting operas {{in this way}} came from the new incoming general manager of <b>the</b> <b>Met,</b> Peter Gelb in late 2006. Exhibiting <b>the</b> <b>Met's</b> performances in digital movie theaters {{is in line with}} other audience-expanding efforts by <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> such as radio broadcasts on Sirius Radio, iPod downloads, live streaming video on <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> website, and free opening night screenings in Times Square and at Lincoln Center. <b>The</b> <b>Met</b> is also sponsoring free HD broadcasts into selected New York City public schools.|$|R
5|$|The series {{shifted to}} Citi Field, the home stadium of <b>the</b> <b>Mets,</b> for Game 3. Yordano Ventura {{started for the}} Royals and Noah Syndergaard started for <b>the</b> <b>Mets.</b> The {{ceremonial}} first pitch was thrown by Mike Piazza to catcher Kevin Plawecki. With no designated hitter (DH) in NL parks, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> started Michael Conforto, their DH for Game 2, in the outfield instead of Juan Lagares, and the Royals did not start Kendrys Morales, their regular DH.|$|E
5|$|The {{signing of}} former Phillies closer Billy Wagner by <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> between the 2005 and 2006 seasons {{was a factor}} in the {{intensification}} of the rivalry. Pat Burrell and Wagner became embroiled in heated media discussions after Wagner departed the Phillies. For the first time in 2006, both franchises fielded contenders until deep into the season. <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> steadily led the NL East (finally supplanting the decade-long division champions, the Atlanta Braves), while the Phillies maintained pace as a wild card contender until {{the very end of the}} season. <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> won the head-to-head season matchup, beating the Phillies 11 out of 18 times. <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> won the division, but lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2006 National League Championship Series.|$|E
5|$|The team began a {{road trip}} against two {{division}} rivals: <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> and the Nationals. In {{the first game of}} <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> series, the Phillies lost 7–1 against Bartolo Colón; although Colón and A. J. Burnett (the Phillies' starter) were trade candidates, neither was traded. The next day Utley hit a grand slam and Hamels continued his dominance as the Phillies shut out <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> 6–0, but <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> routed the Phillies 11–2 in the series finale. The last game of the month opened a four-game series with the Nationals; the Phillies won 10–4 but Lee re-injured his elbow, probably ending his season.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Met</b> Breuer will be {{overseen by}} Sheena Wagstaff, {{previously}} at the Tate Modern, {{who has been}} the head of the Modern and Contemporary Art Department of <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> since 2012. Director and CEO of <b>the</b> <b>Met,</b> Thomas P. Campbell, has spearheaded the effort with a stated focus on the digital (moving from analog to digital) and focusing on accessibility and outreach. He considers <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> to be <b>the</b> largest encyclopedic museum in the world, with <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> Breuer an important part of that, especially as it works towards meaningfully engaging with a global audience, as well as the visitors who come to the museum in person. Both Campbell and Wagstaff see <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> Breuer as a sculptural creation and artwork in its own right.|$|R
50|$|Other African Americans had preceded Price {{in leading}} roles at <b>the</b> <b>Met.</b> However, Price {{was the first}} African American to build a star career {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, the first to return to <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> in {{multiple}} leading roles, and the first to earn <b>the</b> <b>Met's</b> top fee. In 1964, according to <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> archives, Leontyne Price was paid $2,750 per performance, on a par with Joan Sutherland, Maria Callas and Renata Tebaldi. At the time, Birgit Nilsson, who was unique in singing Italian and Wagnerian roles, earned <b>the</b> <b>Met's</b> highest fee, $3,000 a performance.|$|R
50|$|She {{also played}} {{badminton}} internationally for Wales before joining <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> Office in February 1994, where she began a five-month forecaster training course at <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> Office college, {{at the former}} RAF Shinfield Park (occupied by <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> Office from 1971-2004).

5|$|After {{starting}} the 1979 {{season with a}} 1–5 win-loss record, Ellis {{was traded to the}} New York Mets on June 15, 1979 for minor league pitchers Mike Bruhert and Bob Myrick. <b>The</b> <b>Mets,</b> seeking to upgrade their pitching staff due to poor performances and injuries to Pat Zachry and Skip Lockwood, acquired Andy Hassler from the Boston Red Sox on the same day. Ellis went 3–7 with a 6.04 ERA with <b>the</b> <b>Mets.</b>|$|E
5|$|Baseball America rated Humber as the 50th-best {{prospect}} {{in baseball}} {{heading into the}} 2005 season. Humber entered spring training in 2005 with <b>the</b> <b>Mets.</b> There, he clashed with Mets' pitching coach Rick Peterson, who wanted Humber to adopt a different training regimen and change the manner with which he threw {{the ball to the}} plate. <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> front office supported Humber, telling him to pitch how he felt comfortable.|$|E
5|$|DeGrom {{began playing}} {{baseball}} as a shortstop and was {{converted into a}} pitcher during his junior year at Stetson. <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> selected him in the ninth round of the 2010 MLB Draft, and he made his MLB debut with <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> on May 15, 2014. That year, deGrom was named the National League's (NL) Rookie of the Month twice, and the NL Rookie of the Year. In 2015, deGrom was selected as an MLB All-Star.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>MET</b> began {{operation}} in 1973 with only five fixed routes; these included Crosstown, Grand, Broadwater, Central, and Southside.In 1993 <b>the</b> <b>MET</b> opened up its first transfer center at Stewart Park for passengers to utilize in transferring to connection buses. In July 1996 <b>the</b> <b>MET</b> started <b>the</b> [...] "Bike and Ride" [...] program {{in an attempt}} to attract new riders; by 2004, the program had 1,411 bike-and-ride users.In 2002 <b>the</b> <b>MET</b> added its S.S. Loop to the fleet list adding extra service to the Billings south side and Route 11M Northwest was dropped off <b>the</b> <b>MET</b> route fleet.In 2003 <b>the</b> <b>MET</b> remodeled its Stewart Park transfer center.In the summer of 2008, construction began on the new Downtown transfer center at 220 N. 25th Street; this was completed in early 2009 and it was open for business. This resulted in various changes to the routes and schedules for the buses that transfer in Downtown. Further, <b>the</b> <b>MET</b> raised its fare prices from $0.75 to $1.25 and from $0.25 to $0.50. In 2011 <b>the</b> <b>MET</b> once again faced a schedule change; Route 12P Overland Avenue was taken off the fleet.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2011, as <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> {{conducted}} {{its three}} newly initiated investigations of illegal acquisition of confidential information, it pursued ongoing leaks from <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> concerning evidence it held {{as well as}} earlier leaks {{that gave rise to}} the various investigations. In an apparent effort to discourage future leaks, <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> took <b>the</b> unusual action of invoking the Official Secrets Act, which provides for severe penalties. Specifically, <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> used <b>the</b> Act to call for the journalists at The Guardian to reveal their sources for information upon which the Milly Dowler revelations were based. In defense of their action, <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> issued a statement saying: ...|$|R

5|$|Granderson played college {{baseball}} at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and {{was selected}} by the Tigers in the 2002 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut with the Tigers in 2004, and signed a contract extension with Detroit in 2008. After the 2009 season, he {{was traded to the}} Yankees. After his contract expired following the 2013 season, he signed a four-year contract with <b>the</b> <b>Mets.</b> In the final season of the contract, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> traded him to the Dodgers.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{after leading}} the {{division}} {{standing by the}} end of April, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> again began to struggle. <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> would not hold first place at any point after May 1, although they came close in mid-June. By {{the end of the season}} <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> had finished 18 games behind the first place Phillies. For its part, Philadelphia was mainly engaged in a fierce division race with the Atlanta Braves, trailing them as late in the season as September 6. However, Philadelphia would surge at the end of the month and once again be crowned division champs. 2010 ultimately served as a disappointment for the Mets–Phillies rivalry.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the Phillies won {{the season}} series against <b>the</b> <b>Mets,</b> winning 11 of 18 games. The Phillies {{set a record}} for wins in a season with 102, surpassing the {{previous}} record of 101, set back-to-back in 1976 and 1977, while <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> finished 25 games out of first place at 7785, in fourth place and missed {{the playoffs for the}} fifth straight year.|$|E
5000|$|In 2014, <b>the</b> <b>MET</b> began a {{new program}} for {{disabled}} veterans.

50|$|The {{model of}} General Manager {{as the leading}} {{authority}} in the company returned in 1990 when Joseph Volpe was appointed. Volpe was <b>the</b> <b>Met's</b> third-longest serving manager {{until his retirement in}} 2006. He was the first head of <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> to advance from within the ranks of the company, having started his career there as a carpenter in 1964. During his tenure <b>the</b> <b>Met's</b> international touring activities were expanded and Levine focused on expanding and building <b>the</b> <b>Met's</b> orchestra into a world-class symphonic ensemble with its own Carnegie Hall concert series. Under Volpe <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> considerably expanded its repertory, offering four world premiers and 22 Met premiers, more new works than under any manager since Gatti-Casazza. Volpe named Valery Gergiev as Principal Guest Conductor in 1997 and broadened <b>the</b> <b>Met's</b> Russian repertory. Marcelo Álvarez, Gabriela Beňačková, Diana Damrau, Natalie Dessay, Renée Fleming, Juan Diego Flórez, Marcello Giordani, Angela Gheorghiu, Susan Graham, Ben Heppner, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Sergej Kopčák, Salvatore Licitra, Anna Netrebko, René Pape, Neil Rosenshein, Bryn Terfel, and Deborah Voigt were among the artists first heard at <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> under his management.|$|R
5|$|On February 2, 2008, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> traded Humber, {{along with}} outfielder Carlos Gómez and {{pitchers}} Kevin Mulvey and Deolis Guerra, to the Twins for Santana. At the time Baseball America ranked Guerra, Gomez, Mulvey and Humber the second, third, fourth and seventh-best prospects in <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> organization, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The 1963 season {{unfolded}} for <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> {{much like}} the previous year's, though they lost only eight games to begin the season, rather than nine, but they still finished 51–111, in last place. One highlight, though it did not count in the standings, was the Mayor's Trophy Game on June 20 at Yankee Stadium. Stengel played to win; the Yankees under Houk possibly less so, and <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> beat the Yankees, 6–2.|$|E
5|$|The 1999 National League wild-card tie-breaker {{game was}} a one-game {{extension}} to Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1999 regular season, played between the New York Mets and Cincinnati Reds {{to determine the}} winner of the National League (NL) wild card. It was played at Cinergy Field in Cincinnati, on October 4, 1999. <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> won the game, 5–0, with starting pitcher Al Leiter pitching a two-hit shutout. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> qualified for the postseason and the Reds did not.|$|E
50|$|No {{apparent}} investigative {{action was}} taken by <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> from <b>the</b> time documentary evidence of the computer hacking came into its possession until 10 June 2011, when Operation Tuleta was launched. Like Operation Weeting, Tuleta was led by <b>the</b> <b>Met's</b> Sue Akers. Hurst stated <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> notified him of the 2006 hacking in July 2011.|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> <b>Met,</b> he notably {{conducted}} the United States premieres of Umberto Giordano's Fedora and Hector Berlioz's La damnation de Faust in 1906. He also conducted <b>the</b> <b>Met's</b> first performances of Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore and Lucrezia Borgia in 1904, and <b>the</b> <b>Met's</b> first performances of Manon Lescaut and Madama Butterfly in 1907, {{both of them}} supervised by Puccini. He also led performances of new productions of Verdi's Aida, Donizetti's Don Pasquale, Ponchielli's La Gioconda, Bellini's La sonnambula, Meyerbeer's L'Africaine, Verdi's Rigoletto at <b>the</b> <b>Met.</b>|$|R
50|$|Movie {{and radio}} {{broadcast}} revenue increased for <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> from about $5 million in 2006, Live in HD's first year, to $22 million in 2008, with Live in HD contributing {{the bulk of}} the growth. For the 2009/10 season, <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> spent about $12 million in production and received about half of the $47 million box-office gross. After paying royalties to its cast and crew, <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> earned a $8 million profit. <b>The</b> <b>Met's</b> Live in HD revenue for the 2012/13 season was $34.5 million.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> {{have made}} 11 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft. They have also made the first overall selection five times (1966, 1968, 1980, 1984, and 1994), tied for the most such picks with the San Diego Padres. The first of these picks, Steve Chilcott (1966), {{is one of only}} two first overall picks (along with Brien Taylor) to never play in the major leagues. <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> have had 18 compensatory picks since the institution of the First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the prior off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. One player, George Ambrow (1970), did not sign with <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> after he was drafted but they received no compensation pick.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> lost 120 {{games in}} their inaugural season, the most by a post-1900 MLB team. After six more {{years in which}} their best league finish was ninth, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> won the World Series in 1969, {{defeating}} the Baltimore Orioles in five games to earn what is widely {{considered one of the}} biggest upsets in baseball history. Four seasons later, <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> returned to the World Series, where they lost to the Oakland Athletics in seven games. After winning two NL championships in five years, New York struggled for the next decade, not coming within 10 games of the NL East leader until 1984.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> {{promoted}} deGrom to {{the major}} leagues on May 12, 2014, after Gonzalez Germen {{was placed on the}} disabled list. <b>The</b> <b>Mets</b> planned to use deGrom in relief, but an injury to Dillon Gee required <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> to insert him into their starting rotation. DeGrom made his major league debut on May 15 against cross-town rival New York Yankees in Citi Field. He faced fellow rookie Chase Whitley, also making his MLB debut. He pitched seven innings, allowing only one run and striking out six, but the Yankees shut out <b>the</b> <b>Mets</b> and won 1–0. DeGrom also collected his first MLB hit in the game in his first career at bat. It was the first hit by a Mets pitcher in the 2014 season ending an 0-for-64 hitless streak, the worst collective mark by a pitching staff to begin a season in MLB history.|$|E
50|$|He {{gave his}} Metropolitan Opera debut in 2012/13 as Mandarin in Puccini's Turandot, {{followed}} Parsifal as Grail Knight. The following season at <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> {{saw him as}} Bonze in Madama Butterfly and as Jailer in Tosca. In 2014/15 he sang Rambo in The Death of Klinghoffer at <b>the</b> <b>Met.</b> Green returned to <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> in 2016 as Colline.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Met's</b> {{fate was}} {{essentially}} sealed when, {{as part of}} the AFL-NFL Merger, the NFL declared that stadiums smaller than 50,000 were inadequate for its needs; at its height <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> only seated 48,700 for football. [...] However, the Vikings would not even consider playing at the University of Minnesota's Memorial Stadium, and demanded a brand-new stadium as a condition of staying in town. At one point, the city of Bloomington had plans to place a dome over Metropolitan Stadium, or build a new football stadium located between <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> Center, which had opened in 1967 just north of <b>the</b> <b>Met.</b> Since football-only stadiums were not seen as viable at the time, the Twins decided not to renew their lease at <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> after <b>the</b> 1981 season. This accelerated the push for construction of a new stadium, the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, which was completed in 1982.|$|R
