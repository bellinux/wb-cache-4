5|$|Physiological serpin {{polymers}} {{are thought}} to form via domain swapping events, where a segment of one serpin protein inserts into another. Domain-swaps occur when mutations or environmental factors interfere with {{the final stages of}} serpin folding to the native state, causing high-energy intermediates to misfold. Both dimer and <b>trimer</b> domain-swap structures have been solved. In the dimer (of antithrombin), the RCL and part of the A-sheet incorporates into the A-sheet of another serpin molecule. The domain-swapped <b>trimer</b> (of antitrypsin) forms via the exchange of an entirely different region of the structure, the B-sheet (with each molecule's RCL inserted into its own A-sheet). It has also been proposed that serpins may form domain-swaps by inserting the RCL of one protein into the A-sheet of another (A-sheet polymerisation). These domain-swapped dimer and <b>trimer</b> structures are though to be the building blocks of the disease-causing polymer aggregates, but the exact mechanism is still unclear.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, two {{independent}} efforts have elucidated the molecular {{architecture of the}} 26S proteasome by single particle electron microscopy. More recently, a pseudo-atomic atomic model has been built, again using cryo-EM. In {{the heart of the}} 19S, directly adjacent to the 20S, are the AAA-ATPases (AAA proteins) that assemble to a heterohexameric ring of the order Rpt1/Rpt2/Rpt6/Rpt3/Rpt4/Rpt5. This ring is a <b>trimer</b> of dimers: Rpt1/Rpt2, Rpt6/Rpt3, and Rpt4/Rpt5 dimerize via their N-terminal coiled-coils. These coiled-coils protrude from the hexameric ring. The largest regulatory particle non-ATPases Rpn1 and Rpn2 bind to the tips of Rpt1/2 and Rpt6/3, respectively. The ubiquitin receptor Rpn13 binds to Rpn2 and completes the base cub-complex. The lid covers one half of the AAA-ATPase hexamer (Rpt6/Rpt3/Rpt4) and, unexpectedly, directly contacts the 20S via Rpn6 and to lesser extent Rpn5. The subunits Rpn9, Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn7, Rpn3, and Rpn12, which are structurally related among themselves and to subunits of the COP9 complex and eIF3 (hence called PCI subunits) assemble to a horseshoe-like structure enclosing the Rpn8/Rpn11 heterodimer. Rpn11, the deubiquinating enzyme, is placed {{at the mouth of the}} AAA-ATPase hexamer, ideally positioned to remove ubiquitin moieties immediately before translocation of substrates into the 20S. The second ubiquitin receptor identified to date, Rpn10, is positioned at the periphery of the lid, near subunits Rpn8 and Rpn9.|$|E

40|$|Adiponectin is an adipocyte-secreted {{hormone that}} exists as <b>trimers,</b> hexamers and larger species collectively {{referred}} to as HMW (high-molecular-weight) adiponectin. Whether hexamers or HMW adiponectin serve as precursors for <b>trimers</b> outside the circulation is currently unknown. Here, we demonstrate that adiponectin <b>trimers</b> can be generated from larger oligomers secreted from primary rat adipose cells or differentiated 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Purified hexameric, but not HMW, adiponectin converted into <b>trimers</b> in conditioned media separated from 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes or, more efficiently, when enclosed in the dialysis membrane {{in the presence of}} adipocytes. Several lines of evidence indicate that the conversion is mediated by an extracellular redox system. First, N-terminal epitope-tagged hexamers converted into <b>trimers</b> without proteolytic removal of the tag. Secondly, appearance of <b>trimers</b> was associated with conversion of disulfide-bonded dimers into monomers. Thirdly, thiol-reactive agents inhibited conversion into <b>trimers.</b> Consistent with a redox-based mechanism, purified hexamers reductively converted into <b>trimers</b> in defined glutathione redox buffer with reduction potential typically found in the extracellular environment while the HMW adiponectin remained stable. In addition, conversion of hexamers into <b>trimers</b> was enhanced by NADPH, but not by NADP&#x 002 B;.

40|$|The {{structure}} of BG 505 gp 140 SOSIP, a soluble mimic {{of the native}} HIV- 1 envelope glycoprotein (Env), {{marks the beginning of}} new era in Env structure-based immunogen design. Displaying a well-ordered quaternary structure, these subtype A-derived <b>trimers</b> display an excellent antigenic profile, discriminating recognition by broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) from non-broadly neutralizing antibodies (non-bNAbs), and provide a solid Env-based immunogenic platform starting point. Even with this important advance, obtaining homogeneous well-ordered soluble SOSIP <b>trimers</b> derived from other subtypes remains challenging. Here, we report the "rescue" of homogeneous well-ordered subtype B and C SOSIP <b>trimers</b> from a heterogeneous Env mixture using CD 4 binding site-directed (CD 4 bs) non-bNAbs in a negative-selection purification process. These non-bNAbs recognize the primary receptor CD 4 bs only on disordered <b>trimers</b> but not on the native Env spike or well-ordered soluble <b>trimers</b> due to steric hindrance. Following negative selection to remove disordered oligomers, we demonstrated recovery of well-ordered, homogeneous <b>trimers</b> by electron microscopy (EM). We obtained 3 D EM reconstructions of unliganded <b>trimers,</b> as well as in complex with sCD 4, a panel of CD 4 bs-directed bNAbs, and the cleavage-dependent, trimer-specific bNAb, PGT 151. Using bio-layer light interferometry (BLI) we demonstrated that the well-ordered <b>trimers</b> were efficiently recognized by bNAbs and poorly recognized by non-bNAbs, representing soluble mimics of the native viral spike. Biophysical characterization was consistent with the thermostability of a homogeneous species that could be further stabilized by specific bNAbs. This study revealed that Env <b>trimers</b> generate different frequencies of well-ordered versus disordered aberrant <b>trimers</b> even when they are genetically identical. By negatively selecting the native-like well-ordered <b>trimers,</b> we establish a new means to obtain soluble Env mimetics derived from subtypes B and C for expanded use as candidate vaccine immunogens...|$|R

We investigated this question {{by the use of}} monoclonal antibodies specific for monomers and <b>trimers</b> of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA). In untreated influenza virus-infected cells, monomers and <b>trimers</b> almost exclusively partition into the ER and GC, respectively.

Cell fractionation experiments indicate, however, that whereas HA monomers synthesized in the presence of BFA reside predominantly in vesicles with a characteristic density of the ER, HA <b>trimers</b> are primarily located in lighter vesicles characteristic of post-ER compartments. Biochemical experiments confirm that in BFA-treated cells, <b>trimers</b> are more extensively modified than monomers by GC-associated enzymes. Additional immunofluorescence experiments reveal that in BFA-treated cells, HA monomers can exist in an ER subcompartment less accessible to <b>trimers</b> and, conversely, that <b>trimers</b> are present in a vesicular compartment less accessible to monomers.

40|$|The six {{individual}} catalytic polypeptide chains {{within the}} two catalytic <b>trimers</b> of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase; EC 2. 1. 3. 2) are folded into two discrete structural domains interconnected {{in part by}} helix 12, which comprises residues 285 - 305 and is located near the carboxyl terminus of the chain. The essential role of this helix in folding of the chains and their assembly into ATCase was demonstrated by introducing a stop codon at the position corresponding to amino acid 284, 291, or 299. Cells containing these mutations are pyrimidine auxotrophs lacking ATCase-like protein in cell extracts. In contrast, stable active enzyme is formed from chains truncated at position 306 or 307, showing that all 310 amino acids are not required for assembly. Replacements of Gln- 288, Asn- 291, Arg- 296, and Ala- 298 were introduced to assess the effect of alterations within helix 12 on protein stability. Stability of the <b>trimers</b> was measured both by differential scanning microcalorimetry and by the rate of exchange of chains at 4 degrees C when mutant <b>trimers</b> were incubated with succinylated wild-type <b>trimers.</b> Melting temperatures of the mutant <b>trimers</b> spanned a range of more than 20 degrees C, with a few higher and others {{lower than that of}} wild-type <b>trimers.</b> Large changes in interchain interaction energies were observed for the <b>trimers,</b> but there was no direct correlation between the ease of dissociation of the <b>trimers</b> and their thermal stability. Calorimetry on the mutant holoenzymes revealed alterations in the interactions between <b>trimers</b> and regulatory subunits within the intact enzymes.

The association of LPS with OmpF <b>trimers</b> was assessed by staining, autoradiography of LPS specifically labeled with [1 - 14 C]galactose, and Western immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody specific for OmpF <b>trimers.</b> These techniques revealed that the migration distances and multiple banding patterns of OmpF porin <b>trimers</b> in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels were dictated by the chemotype of associated LPS. Expression of smooth LPS caused {{almost all of the}} trimeric OmpF to run in gels with a slower mobility than <b>trimers</b> from rough strains. The LPS associated with <b>trimers</b> from a smooth strain differed from the bulk-phase LPS by consisting almost exclusively of molecules with O antigen...|$|R
