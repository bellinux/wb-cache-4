5|$|As {{the colonists}} fenced off more land, the Noongar were {{increasingly}} {{denied access to}} their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers' crops and killed their cattle. They also developed a taste for the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of firestick farming: firing the bush <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>out</b> game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.|$|E
5|$|Eight of {{the attacks}} {{occurred}} in South Mumbai: at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, the Oberoi Trident, the Taj Palace & Tower, Leopold Cafe, Cama Hospital, the Nariman House Jewish community centre, the Metro Cinema, and in a lane behind the Times of India building and St. Xavier's College. There was also an explosion at Mazagaon, in Mumbai's port area, and in a taxi at Vile Parle. By the early morning of 28 November, all sites except for the Taj Hotel had been secured by Mumbai Police Department and security forces. On 29 November, India's National Security Guards (NSG) conducted 'Operation Black Tornado' <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>out</b> the remaining attackers; it culminated {{in the death of}} the last remaining attackers at the Taj Hotel and ended the attacks.|$|E
5|$|Although {{adapted to}} {{terrestrial}} life, frogs resemble freshwater fish in {{their inability to}} conserve body water effectively. When they are on land, much water is lost by evaporation from the skin. The excretory system {{is similar to that}} of mammals and there are two kidneys that remove nitrogenous products from the blood. Frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>out</b> toxic products from the kidney tubules. The nitrogen is excreted as ammonia by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as urea, a less toxic product, by most terrestrial adults. A few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even less toxic uric acid. The urine passes along paired ureters to the urinary bladder from which it is vented periodically into the cloaca. All bodily wastes exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent.|$|E

5|$|The Persian {{fleet and}} army wintered at Miletus, before setting out in 493 BC to finally stamp {{out the last}} embers of the revolt. They {{attacked}} and captured the islands of Chios, Lesbos and Tenedos. On each, they made a 'human-net' of troops and swept across the whole island <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>out</b> any hiding rebels. They then moved over to the mainland and captured each of the remaining cities of Ionia, similarly seeking out any remaining rebels. Although the cities of Ionia were undoubtedly harrowed in the aftermath, none seems to have suffered quite the fate of Miletus. Herodotus says that the Persians chose the most handsome boys from each city and castrated them, and chose the most beautiful girls and sent them away to the king's harem, and then burnt the temples of the cities. While this is possibly true, Herodotus also probably exaggerates the scale of devastation. In a few years, the cities had more-or-less returned to normal {{and they were able}} to equip a large fleet for the second Persian invasion of Greece, just 13 years later.|$|E
5|$|The {{build up}} of Australian forces was {{hampered}} {{by a lack}} of resources, which were focused largely upon the US operations in the Philippines, and Australian operations in Borneo, which was considered the priority, and ultimately these considerations would impact upon Australian strategy upon the island due to the limited amount of amphibious support available. After initial moves by the Australians to take over the US perimeter at Torokina and garrison the Outer Islands in September and October, in November the Australians took over officially from the Americans. Later that month, troops from the 7th Brigade left the perimeter and took over from the small US forces holding outposts along the Numa Numa Trail in the centre of the island. From there, a couple of minor skirmishes followed culminating in the Battle of Pearl Ridge. In late December, the 11th Brigade, under the command of Brigadier John Stevenson, took over control of the northern sector of the island from the 7th Brigade, which was transferred to the southern sector {{to take part in the}} main offensive. Throughout January, as part of efforts to liberate the northern part of the island, the brigade advanced north along the coast from Kuraio Mission, clearing the main settlements while sending patrols inland in an effort <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>out</b> the Japanese from the high features in an effort to draw them into fighting in the open. In mid-January the lead Australian battalion, the 31st/51st Infantry Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Kelly, came up against a strong Japanese position at Tsimba Ridge and over the course of three weeks fought to gain control of the feature. The Australians lost 23 killed and 53 wounded while the Japanese had at least 66 men killed.|$|E

25|$|The modern {{cleanroom}} {{was invented}} by American physicist Willis Whitfield. As employee of the Sandia National Laboratories, Whitfield created the initial plans for the cleanroom in 1960.

Whitfield designed his cleanroom with a constant, highly filtered air flow <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>out</b> impurities. Within {{a few years of}} its invention in the 1960s, Whitfield's modern cleanroom had generated more than 50 billion USD in sales worldwide.|$|E

50|$|Typically, before solvent or {{reagents}} {{are introduced}} into a Schlenk flask, the flask is dried {{and the atmosphere}} of the flask is exchanged with an inert gas. A common method of exchanging {{the atmosphere of the}} flask is <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> the flask <b>out</b> with an inert gas. The gas can be introduced through the side arm of the flask, or via a wide bore needle (attached to a gas line). The contents of the flask exit the flask through the neck portion of the flask. The needle method has the advantage that the needle can be placed {{at the bottom of the}} flask <b>to</b> better <b>flush</b> <b>out</b> the atmosphere of the flask. <b>Flushing</b> a flask <b>out</b> with an inert gas can be inefficient for large flasks and is impractical for complex apparatus.|$|R
25|$|After {{the flood}} damage of 1924, the {{railroad}} only fixed {{the part of}} the canal serving Georgetown, since they sold water to the mills therein, leaving the rest of the canal in disrepair. In 1928-1929 there was some talk of restoring and reopening the canal from Cumberland to Williamsport, but with the onset of the Great Depression, the plans were never realized In April 1929 after some freshet damage, the railroad repaired a break in the towpath, so that they could continue <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>out</b> mosquitoes as demanded by the Maryland board of health.|$|E
25|$|The British {{flag was}} raised over {{the ruins of}} Falamai, the islands' capital, and civil {{administration}} was restored on 1 November.

25|$|Hot water {{suits are}} used in cold water {{commercial}} surface supplied diving. A hose in the umbilical line, which links the diver to the surface support, carries the hot water from a heater on the surface down to the suit. The diver controls the flow rate of the water from a valve near his waist, allowing him to vary {{the warmth of the}} suit in response to changes in environmental conditions and workload. Tubes inside the suit distribute the water to the limbs, chest, and back. Special boots, gloves, and hood are worn. These suits are normally made of foamed neoprene and are similar to wetsuits in construction and appearance, but they do not fit as closely by design. The wrists and ankles of the suit are open, allowing water <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>out</b> of the suit as it is replenished with fresh hot water from the surface.|$|E
25|$|After Aceh {{was left}} weakened, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) arrived, and Johor formed a treaty with them <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>out</b> the Portuguese {{in the second}} capture of Malacca. The Dutch succeeded at {{overtaking}} Malacca while Johor managed to re-establish its suzerainty over many of its former dependencies in Sumatra, such as Siak (1662) and Indragiri (1669). The Dutch expand {{the size of the}} city fort and built a significant amount of additional infrastructure. As they had less interest in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra than they had in Java and the Maluku Islands, the Dutch remained neutral in local disputes until 1756 when the Bugis, who ruled the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, began to threaten Dutch maritime trade. The threats increase in the 18th century, when English rivalry started to establish its presence over areas in the northern Malay Peninsula. This led the Dutch to seize the Bugis areas of Riau and expelled the Bugis from both Riau and Selangor as fearing these areas would fall under British rule. Malacca were placed under the direct control of Batavia in Java.|$|E
25|$|Blücher {{realized}} that Napoleon {{was trying to}} reach Laon by the Reims road. He sent Bülow and his wagon trains back to Laon. The Prussian commander began to shift his other forces to the northeast. By 6 March Napoleon had 30,500 men near Berry-au-Bac. He planned to send an advanced guard north toward Festieux, but needed to make sure of Blücher's intentions. During the day of 6 March, Meunier's division encountered Russian forces near Vauclair Abbey (Vauclerc) while two battalions of the Old Guard were needed <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>out</b> Craonne's Russian defenders. At first Blücher directed his army to concentrate near Craonne, but he decided that position was too cramped for his 90,000 men. He also heard that French cavalry were advancing north on the Reims road. Changing plans, Blücher planned to assemble 10,000 cavalry and 60 horse artillery guns under Wintzingerode and send it toward Festieux. Wintzingerode's force consisted of 5,500 of his own horsemen plus all of the reserve cavalry belonging to Langeron and Yorck. Blücher ordered Wintzingerode's infantry, commanded by Vorontsov, to remain behind and directly oppose Napoleon's army.|$|E
