5000|$|On 15 April 2014, BP {{claimed that}} cleanup {{along the coast}} was {{substantially}} complete, but the United States Coast Guard responded {{that a lot of}} work remained. Using physical barriers such as floating booms, cleanup workers’ objective was <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> from spreading any further. They used skimmer boats to remove a majority of <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> and they used sorbents to absorb any remnant of oil like a sponge. Although that method did not remove <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> completely, chemicals called dispersants are used <b>to</b> hasten <b>the</b> <b>oil’s</b> degradation <b>to</b> prevent <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> from doing further damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> marine habitats below the surface water.

5|$|Second-generation {{technologies}} include {{solar heating}} and cooling, wind power, modern forms of bioenergy, and solar photovoltaics.

Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials.|$|E

But in modern times their fortunes have been closely tied by their cores of heavy industry.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the {{sustained}} rise {{in oil prices}} had only a limited impact on demand. It was a good year across all segments of the tanker market segments, but {{not as good as}} 2004 and 2005. Amidst high oil prices, geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> supply, growing demand was the main driving force in the tanker shipping market for the year. As demand grew moderately in the United States and Western Europe, expanding economies such as China fueled exponential growth in demand. Despite these strengths, each of the five tanker freight indices dropped during 2006. Product tanker demand increased in 2006 due to economic expansion in Asia, especially China and India, however, average time charter equivalent earnings for these ships decreased compared with the two prior years.|$|E

Chief Engineer Thomas Lynch of William S. Grattan lost his life and seven other crew members were injured. The unattended boilers on William S.

5|$|Hiyō {{departed}} Japan for Singapore on 24 November.

In the meantime, the Japanese Navy had restructured its carrier air groups so that one air group was assigned to one carrier division and Air Group 652 {{was assigned to the}} 2nd Carrier Division with Hiyō, Junyō and Ryūhō on 1 March. The air group was last in priority to be rebuilt and only had 30 Model 21 Zeros, 13 Model 52 Zeros and 4 D3As on hand on 1 April of its authorized 81 fighters, 36 dive bombers and 27 torpedo bombers. The ships conducted training for their aircraft in the Inland Sea until 11 May when she sailed for Tawi-Tawi in the Philippines. The new base was closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> wells in Borneo on which the Navy relied and also to the Palau and western Caroline Islands where the Japanese expected the next American attack.

5|$|Strong winds {{knocked out}} power and {{telephone}} lines across the eastern {{region of the}} country, leaving thousands isolated until the lines were repaired hours later. The cyclone caused extensive damage along the coastline, including {{in the city of}} Sur and the village of Ras al Hadd at the easternmost point of the Omani mainland. In Muscat, winds reached 100km/h (62mph), leaving the capital city without power. Strong waves and heavy rainfall flooded streets and some buildings. Police workers in the city sent text messages to keep people away from flooded streets to prevent electrocutions. Little damage was reported <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> fields of the nation. The liquefied natural gas terminal in Sur, which handles 10million tonnes of gas each year, was badly hit by the storm and could not be operated. Overall, the cyclone killed 50people in the country; by the fourth day after it struck the country, 27 people had been reported missing. Around 20,000people were affected, and damage in the country was estimated at around $4.2billion (2007USD).|$|E

5|$|This was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to cause significant disruption to oil refining in the Gulf of Mexico. Several hundred active wells went out of service, and drilling {{came to a halt}} for a few days during and after the cyclone's passage. One of Humble company's tenders saw three-quarters of its mooring chains compromised, which swung it around into an adjacent oil platform, causing $200,000 in damage (1956USD). The cost to downtime in production was greater than the damage Flossy created <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> rigs. There was no loss of life. Due to the impact of Flossy on oil refining in the Gulf of Mexico, the American Petroleum Institute formed a committee called Fundamental Research on Weather Forecasting. Their goal was to use mathematical models and historic data to better predict hurricane formation and path. Studies went on into 1962, but no reliable forecast mechanism was found.|$|E
