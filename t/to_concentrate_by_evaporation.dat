40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a list of}} algae, {{with the exception of}} the diatoms, which have been found in Indiana. The collections, from which this systematic list was prepared, were made largely by the writer during the past three years, 1928 - 29, 1929 - 30, and 1930 - 31, and represent more than 1, 200 collections from 29 counties. The writer is well aware of the fact that this list is perhaps far from complete for the state and that an approximate list must take years of collecting and determining, a task which he hopes to continue. Little or no attempt was made to make determinations in the field as this greatly retarded collecting and under such conditions facilities are not so good for accurate determinations. The material as a rule, that is unless it could be examined in the laboratory shortly, was placed directly in Transeau's Solution which consists of water, 95 per cent alcohol and formaldehyde, in the ratio of 6 : 3 : 1. The writer made approximately 1, 000 permanent slides. The mate-rial was removed first from the preservative and placed in 10 per cent glycerine and water, using a watch glass. The glycerine was allowed <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> <b>by</b> <b>evaporation</b> of the water for two or three days, w^hen pure glycerine was added. The material was now placed on a slide and a small drop of melted glycerine jelly was added (this jelly must not be too warm) and allowed to solidify over night. The slides were then sealed by ringing with balsam. For the desmids this seems to be a very satisfactory method but is very unsatisfactory for the Zygnemales. Historical. The literature dealing with the algae of Indiana con-sists of approximately forty papers, many of which do little more than mention one or two genera. The first written account of the algae of the state seems to have been made by Cox (1876) who lists the genera Oscillatoria and Closterium, and Pediastru-m. angulosum (Ehrenb.) Menegh., Euastriim ansatuni Ralfs. and twelve genera of diatoms with-out species names. These were all from Wayne County. The second report on the algae was by Curtis (1882) who reported approximately seventy-eight diatoms from Marion County. Johnson (1891) lists several species mostly from Lake County, in the northwestern corner,of the state. Mottier (1894) adds Bloomington as a new station for Pleodorina...|$|E
50|$|The {{mangrove}} biome, or mangal, is {{a distinct}} saline woodland or shrubland habitat characterized by depositional coastal environments, where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high-energy wave action. The saline conditions tolerated by various mangrove species range from brackish water, through pure seawater (3 to 4%), <b>to</b> water <b>concentrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>evaporation</b> <b>to</b> over twice the salinity of ocean seawater (up to 9%).|$|R

To provide a technical basis to permit the waste treatment facility, a relatively organic-rich Hanford Tank 241 -AN- 107 waste simulant was spiked with 14 target volatile, semi-volatile and pesticide compounds, and evaporated under vacuum in a bench-scale natural circulation evaporator fitted with an industrial stack off-gas sampler at the Savannah River Technology Center. An evaporator material balance for the target organics was calculated by combining liquid stream mass and analytical data with off-gas emissions estimates obtained using EPA SW- 846 Methods. Volatile and light semi-volatile organic compounds in the waste simulant were found to largely exit through the condenser vent, while heavier semi-volatiles and pesticides generally remain in the evaporator concentrate. An OLI Environmental Simulation Program evaporator model successfully predicted operating conditions and the experimental distribution of the fed target organics exiting in the concentrate, condensate and off-gas streams {{with the exception of}} a few semi-volatile and pesticide compounds. Comparison with Henry's Law predictions suggests the OLI ESP model is constrained by available literature data...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the fresh-water creeks that flow into the Warner Lakes, {{there are a number}} of hot springs that drain into them. The hot springs originate in fractures within Miocene and Oligocene basalt layers below the valley floor. Their water temperature can be as hot as 160 F. Bacterial mats of green algae are common in the hot springs, the algae environments are segregated by temperature and water chemistry. The hot springs introduce minerals that change the water chemistry of the lakes.

50|$|Methods of {{separation}} by specific gravity have a still wider application. The simplest {{of these is}} levigation, which is extensively employed in mechanical analysis of soils and treatment of ores, but is not so successful with rocks, as their components do not, as a rule, differ greatly in specific gravity. Fluids are used that do not attack most rock-forming minerals, but have a high specific gravity. Solutions of potassium mercuric iodide (sp. gr. 3.196), cadmium borotungstate (sp. gr. 3.30), methylene iodide (sp. gr. 3.32), bromoform (sp. gr. 2.86), or acetylene bromide (sp. gr. 3.00) are the principal fluids employed.

40|$|Weichardt {{claims to}} have {{demonstrated}} {{the presence of an}} organic body in the expired air. He allowed the exhaled breath to pass through hydrochloric acid solution, evaporated the resulting solution to dryness on a water bath, and obtained a weighable residue which charred on ignition. If he neutralized the acid solution and concentrated it under reduced pressure, he obtained a solution which inhibited the bluing of the guaiacum indicator by blood. By exposing calcium chloride in a room in which the air had been vitiated, he claimed also to have obtained a substance from the air which prevented the bluing of the guaiacum indicator by blood. The experiments here recorded show that a variable amount of matter is retained by weak hydrochloric solution when exhaled breath is passed through it, and that this matter is volatile on ignition. Contrary to the findings of Weichardt, there is no charring or blackening. Nesslerization shows the residue to consist mainly, if not wholly, of ammonium chloride. This ammonia is believed to have come from the decomposition of food particles about the teeth. In one case the person (S.) had smoked just before the experiment, so that a small amount of the ammonia from the tobacco smoke may have been held temporarily by the saliva and food particles in the mouth and been given off gradually during the experiment. Weichardt's experiments on the inhibition of the guaiacum test for blood by means of the substances retained when exhaled breath is passed through hydrochloric acid or over calcium chloride crystals are not corroborated. It is further shown that the guaiacum indicator is unreliable for these tests {{in view of the fact}} that a small amount of free acid or free alkali will inhibit the guaiacum test for blood. This fact is offered as a probable explanation of Weichardt's results. Calcium chloride alone gives a deep blue color with the guaiacin indicator. Weichardt used this salt to collect from the expired breath certain unknown substances which he claims inhibit the oxidation of guaiacum by blood. His results are therefore inconclusive. The phenolphthalin test for blood has been studied in this connection and further light has been thrown on this reaction. The sodium salt of phenolphthalin is colorless in alkaline solution, and is readily oxidized by minute quantities of blood to phenolphthalein which gives a characteristic deep purplish red color in alkaline solution. It has been found that the presence of calcium chloride and ammonium chloride in small amounts retards and, in large amounts, prevents this reaction. It is believed that any salt composed of a weak base combined with a strong acid will have the same effect. This is discussed in the text. It has also been shown that the presence of calcium chloride or ammonium chloride decreases the depth of color of phenolphthalein in sodium hydroxide solution. Carbon dioxide also prevents the oxidation of phenolphthalin by blood. Of course this does not mean that carbon dioxide prevents the action of the oxidizing ferments generally. In this particular case the substance to be oxidized, namely phenolphthalin, was not allowed by reason of the presence of the carbon dioxide to combine with the alkali and thereby assume a state in which it could be easily oxidized. The results of one experiment seem to indicate a relation between the amount of dissolved oxygen in the solutions and the percentage of oxidation. Sodium chloride either alone or with the aid of hydrogen peroxide is able to bring about the oxidation of phenolphthalin in alkali to a very slight extent (3. 5 to 5 per cent. in twenty-four hours). Therefore phenolphthalin as a test for oxidizing ferments should not be used in the presence of an appreciable amount of inorganic salts or carbon dioxide. Complete dialysis is recommended in these cases. It is also to be noted that the great delicacy of the test allows considerable dilution. Liquids were obtained from the expired breath by passing this through weak hydrochloric acid or by condensing the moisture in it by conducting it through cooled Drechsel bottles. Attempts were then made to prove the presence in these liquids of some substance which inhibits the oxidation of phenolphthalin by blood, but all were unsuccessful. Moreover attempts <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> these liquids <b>by</b> <b>evaporation</b> under reduced pressure or by the passage of a direct current (colloidal travel) were also unsuccessful. It is planned to improve upon the apparatus used <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> colloids <b>by</b> the passage of a direct current, and to test the effect of expired breath products on the rate of oxidation of phenolphthalin by blood...|$|R
