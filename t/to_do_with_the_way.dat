25|$|Ecology in {{the narrow}} sense refers to the {{biological}} science of ecology. However, ecological paradigms and principles are being developed and applied in almost all disciplines, and these paradigms have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> we approach understanding the relationships and inter-connections within and between living beings which give to each its special place and identity. Human ecology, e.g., must certainly {{take account of the}} role of our subjective lives and spiritual needs, as well as our biological ones, in terms of their ecological effects. Ecology in this sense is not a reductionist undertaking, but a movement toward a more whole (or holistic) vision and understanding of world processes. Deep ecology seeks to look into all levels of existence and might be viewed as radical by some; for them a more anthropocentric view is appropriated because it put humans at the center. Learning how to live in harmony with our surroundings is beneficial because stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society. In that way education seems to {{be the best way to}} start. Sustainability education aims to help learners understand their interconnectedness with all life, to become creative problem solvers and active citizens, and to engage personally and intellectually in shaping our common future. Experiential learning and critical pedagogy are central to providing opportunities for learners to engage in transformative sustainability learning. The “Environment” broadly defined, remains somewhat neglected within development studies, despite a substantial increase in contributions to the field over the fifteen years since 2000. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses (with some notable exceptions) often “add on” environmental issues as special lectures or modules, and there remains a tendency for those who are grounded in the material and discursive struggles that define the discipline to consider the environment as an exotic special interest, a problem that manifests itself in societies that have the leisure to care about the natural world. Development of a modern education model promoting patriotism and civic responsibility, active social position and healthy lifestyle is closely linked to the development of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. Development of environmentally responsible personality in individual is of particular importance for graduates of educational institutions. Environmental education could be integrated in different curriculum in most fields: education for sustainable development in the context of ecopedagogy.|$|E
500|$|Over {{several days}} in December 1986, U2 {{travelled}} with Corbijn and Averill on a bus around the Mojave Desert for a photo shoot. The group stayed in small hotels and shot in the desert landscape, beginning at Reno, Nevada, before moving to locations in California such as the ghost town of Bodie, the Harmony Hotel in Twentynine Palms, Zabriskie Point, Death Valley Junction, and other sites in Death Valley. Corbijn rented a panoramic camera to capture more of the desert landscapes, but having no prior experience with the camera, he was unfamiliar with how to focus it. This led to him focusing on the background and leaving the band slightly out of focus. Corbijn said, [...] "Fortunately {{there was a lot}} of light." [...] Averill filmed portions of the trip with an 8 mm film camera. The photo shoots took place in the mornings and evenings, with mid-days spent travelling and on preparation. Corbijn later recounted that the main idea of the shoot was to juxtapose [...] "man and environment, the Irish in America". Averill said of their photographic approach, [...] "What I was trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> we shot the pictures and framed the cover was to suggest the landscape vision and cinematic approach that was taken to the recording." ...|$|E
500|$|Nominal {{impedance}} {{first started}} to be specified {{in the early days}} of telecommunications. [...] At first amplifiers were not available and when they did become available they were expensive. [...] It was consequently necessary to achieve maximum power transfer from the cable at the receiving end in order to maximise the lengths of cables that could be installed. [...] It also became apparent that reflections on the transmission line would severely limit the bandwidth that could be used or the distance that it was practicable to transmit. [...] Matching equipment impedance to the characteristic impedance of the cable reduces reflections (and they are eliminated altogether if the match is perfect) and power transfer is maximised. [...] To this end, all cables and equipment {{started to be}} specified to a standard nominal impedance. [...] The earliest, and still the most widespread, standard is 600 Ω, originally used for telephony. [...] It has to be said that the choice of this figure had more <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> telephones were interfaced into the local exchange than any characteristic of the local telephone cable. [...] Telephones (old style analogue telephones) connect to the exchange through twisted pair cabling. [...] Each leg of the pair is connected to a relay coil which detect the signalling on the line (dialling, handset off-hook etc.). [...] The other end of one coil is connected to a supply voltage and the second coil is connected to ground. [...] A telephone exchange relay coil is around 300 Ω so the two of them together are terminating the line in 600 Ω.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a quantum}} field theory, a {{coupling}} constant and a charge are different but related notions. The coupling constant sets {{the magnitude of}} the force of interaction; for example, in quantum electrodynamics, the fine-structure constant is a coupling constant. The charge in a gauge theory has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> a particle transforms under the gauge symmetry; i.e., its representation under the gauge group. For example, the electron has charge −1 and the positron has charge +1, implying that the gauge transformation has opposite effects on them in some sense. Specifically, if a local gauge transformation [...] is applied in electrodynamics, then one finds (using tensor index notation): ...|$|E

2500|$|One of Kierkegaard's {{recurrent}} themes is {{the importance}} of subjectivity, which has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> people relate themselves to (objective) truths. In Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, he argues that [...] "subjectivity is truth" [...] and [...] "truth is subjectivity." [...] What he means by this is that most essentially, truth {{is not just a matter}} of discovering objective facts. While objective facts are important, there is a second and more crucial element of truth, which involves how one relates oneself to those matters of fact. Since how one acts is, from the ethical perspective, more important than any matter of fact, truth is to be found in subjectivity rather than objectivity.|$|E
2500|$|After two brief replacements, Manheim and Maniac's {{positions}} were filled by Swedish vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin ("Dead") and local drummer Jan Axel Blomberg ("Hellhammer"). With Dead, the band's concerts became notorious. For concerts, Dead {{went to great}} lengths to achieve the image and atmosphere he wished. From the beginning of his career, he was known to wear [...] "corpse paint", which involved covering his face with black and white makeup. According to Necrobutcher, [...] "t wasn't anything <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Kiss and Alice Cooper used makeup. Dead actually wanted to look like a corpse. He didn't do it to look cool". Hellhammer claimed that Dead [...] "was the first black metal musician to use corpse paint". To complete his corpse-like image, Dead would bury his stage clothes and dig them up again to wear on the night of a concert.|$|E

IDF Spokeswoman, Miri Eisen, said {{the decision not to}} allow reporters into the camp was a difficult one: [...] "The press people said 'Listen, the journalists aren't going to like it' and the operational people said 'We don't care about the journalists right now and about our image, we don't want them inside.'

[...] Sal Valentino praised Elliott's vocal style, saying that [...] "Ron had a great low register. He knew how to write in the best keys for me."

2500|$|Vibrato can be {{produced}} by a proper combination of finger, wrist and arm motions. One method, called hand vibrato, involves rocking the hand back at the wrist to achieve oscillation, while another method, arm vibrato, modulates the pitch by rocking at the elbow. A combination of these techniques allows a player to produce a large variety of tonal effects. The [...] "when" [...] and [...] "what for" [...] and [...] "how much" [...] of violin vibrato are artistic matters of style and taste. Different teachers, music schools and styles of music favour different vibrato styles. For example, if you overdo the variation of the note's tone it may become very distracting and overwhelm the piece. In acoustic terms, the interest that vibrato adds to the sound has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that the overtone mix (or tone color, or timbre) and the directional pattern of sound projection change with changes in pitch. By [...] "pointing" [...] the sound at {{different parts of the}} room in a rhythmic way, vibrato adds a [...] "shimmer" [...] or [...] "liveliness" [...] to the sound of a well-made violin. Vibrato is, in a large part, left to the discretion of the violinist. [...] Different types of vibrato will bring different moods to the piece, and the varying degrees and styles of vibrato are often characteristics that stand out in well-known violinists.|$|E
2500|$|The {{influx of}} African-Caribbean {{people to the}} United Kingdom was {{accompanied}} by religious practices more common to the North American continent. In Britain, many African-Caribbean people continued to practise Non-conformist Protestant denominations with an Evangelical influence such as Pentecostalism and Seventh Day Baptism. African-Caribbean people have supported new churches {{in many areas of}} the country, which have grown to act as social centres for the community. Mike Phillips, writing for the UK national archive project, described the influences of the new churches thus; [...] " [...] gave the entire Caribbean community a sense of stability. At a time when migrants were under severe psychological pressure and distrusted the official services, or were misunderstood when they went to them, the Black church groups offered invaluable advice and comfort." [...] In 2005, The Economist magazine discussed the growth of evangelical churches in London and Birmingham; [...] "Another reason is that Britain's most prominent Afro-Caribbean institutionsthe Black evangelical churchesare dominated by the urban poor. That has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the Caribbean was missionised: the hotter brand of Christianity gained most converts among the dispossessed, who then re-exported it to Britain." [...] The manner of worship in some of these churches is more akin to that of African-American practices than to traditional English Catholic or Anglican liturgy. Gospel music also came to play a part in British cultural life. African-Caribbean people played a central role establishing British gospel choirs, most notably the London Community Gospel Choir.|$|E

2500|$|Several historians {{counter the}} {{argument}} that reparations caused the inflation and collapse of the mark. Gerhard Weinberg writes that Germany refused to pay by, and that doing so destroyed their own currency. Anthony Lentin agrees and writes that inflation was [...] "a consequence of the war rather than of the peace" [...] and that hyperinflation {{was a result of}} the [...] "German government's reckless issue of paper money" [...] during the Allied occupation of the Ruhr. British and French experts believed that the Mark was being sabotaged to avoid budgetary and currency reform and to evade reparations. Sally Marks writes that the Germans claimed that reparations destroyed the Mark. Marks writes that historians who say reparations caused hyperinflation have overlooked [...] "that the inflation long predated reparations" [...] and the way [...] "inflation mushroomed" [...] between mid-1921 and the end of 1922 [...] "when Germany was actually paying very little in reparations" [...] and have failed to explain why [...] "the period of least inflation coincided with the period of largest reparation payments...or why Germans claimed after 1930 that reparations were causing deflation". She writes [...] "there is no doubt that British and French suspicions late in 1922 were sound". Marks also writes that the [...] "astronomic inflation which ensued was a result of German policy", whereby the government paid for passive resistance in the Ruhr [...] "from an empty exchequer" [...] and paid off its domestic and war debts with worthless marks. Bell agrees and writes that [...] "inflation had little direct connection with reparation payments themselves, but a great deal <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the German government chose to subsidize industry and to pay the costs of passive resistance to the occupation [...] by extravagant use of the printing press". Bell also writes that hyperinflation was not an inevitable consequence of the Treaty of Versailles, but was among the actual results.|$|E
2500|$|Martha J. Cutter {{discusses}} how {{in many of}} Charlotte Perkins Gilman's works she addresses this [...] "struggle {{in which}} a male-dominated medical establishment attempts to silence women." [...] Gilman's works challenge {{the social construction of}} women in patriarchal medical discourse by displaying women as [...] "silent, powerless, and passive" [...] who refuse treatment. At the time in which her works take place, between 1840 and 1890, women were exceedingly defined as lesser than—sickly and weak. In this time period it was thought that [...] "hysteria" [...] (a disease stereotypically more common in women) was a result of too much education. It was understood that women who spent time in college or studying were over-stimulating their brains and consequently leading themselves into states of hysteria. In fact, many of the diseases recognized in women were seen {{as the result of a}} lack of self-control or self-rule. Different physicians argued that a physician must [...] "assume a tone of authority" [...] and that the idea of a [...] "cured" [...] woman is one who is [...] "subdued, docile, silent, and above all subject to the will and voice of the physician". A hysterical woman is one who craves power and in order for her to be treated for her hysteria, she must submit to her physician whose role is to undermine her desires. Often women were prescribed bed rest as a form of treatment, which was meant to [...] "tame" [...] them and basically keep them imprisoned. Treatments such as this were a way of ridding women of rebelliousness and forcing them to conform to social roles. In her works Gilman highlights that the harm caused by these types of treatments for woman i.e. [...] "the rest cure" [...] has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which her voice is silenced. Paula Treichler explains [...] "In this story diagnosis 'is powerful and public[...] [...] [...] It is a male voice that [...] [...] [...] imposes controls on the female narrator and dictates how she is to perceive and talk about the world.' Diagnosis covertly functions to empower the male physician's voice and disempower the female patient's". The narrator in [...] "The Yellow Wallpaper" [...] is not allowed to participate in her own treatment or diagnosis and is completely forced to succumb to everything in which her doctor and in this particular story, her husband, says. The male voice is the one in which forces controls on the female and decides how she is allowed to perceive and speak about the world around her.|$|E
