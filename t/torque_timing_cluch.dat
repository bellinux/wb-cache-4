Results show that the injection timing can be slightly retarded when biodiesel fuel is applied for improved performance and reduced NOx emission. To explain this phenomenon, combustion analysis is conducted based on the cylinder pressure measurement. The shorter ignition delay of biodiesel combustion explains why the best <b>torque</b> <b>timing</b> should be retarded for biodiesel fuel...|$|R

In this work, the lower heating value of gasoline is about 13. 6 % {{higher than that of}} natural gas. Based on the experimental results, the natural gas operation causes an increase of about 6. 2 % brake special fuel consumption, 22 % water temperature difference between outlet and inlet engine, 3 % exhaust valve seat temperature, 2. 3 % brake thermal efficiency and a decrease of around 20. 1 % maximum brake torque, 6. 8 % exhaust gas temperature and 19 % lubricating oil temperature when compared to gasoline operation.

40|$|In {{order to}} analyze the effect of {{hydrogen}} rich gas addition (HRG) on lean burn engine’s thermal efficiency and emission, an experimental research was conducted on a gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine using definite fraction of HRG. The results showed that HRG addition could significantly extend the lean operation limit, improve the engine’s lean burn ability, and decrease burn duration. HRG addition 10 %, 18 %, and 30 % extended the lean limit equivalence ratio 0. 62, 0. 58, and 0. 52 respectively. Combustion duration decreased as increasing fraction of HRG due to speed up flame propagation. HC emission decreased with the increasing fraction of HRG upto equivalence ratio 0. 6 due to higher cylinder temperatures {{making it easier to}} burn lean mixtures. But thereafter HC emissions steadily increased despite of HRG addition as amount of fuel in regions was very lean to burn during primary combustion process. The same trend was observed in CO emission. However, nitrogen oxides (NOx) were found to increase with HRG addition because of hydrogen’s high burn speed. Thermal efficiency increased 3 % with addition of HRG at equivalence ratio 0. 7. The experimental results showed that the maximum brake <b>torque</b> <b>timing</b> (MBT), air fuel ratio and HRG supplementation were implied significant influence on lean limit operation, burn durations, thermal efficiency and exhaust emission.

50|$|Water has a {{very high}} heat of vaporization. As the ambient {{temperature}} water is injected into the engine, heat transfers from the hot cylinder head and intake air into the water. This makes it evaporate, cooling the intake charge. A cooler intake charge means it is more dense (higher volumetric efficiency) and also has a lower tendency to knock. However, the water vapor displaces some air, negating some of the denser intake charge benefit. Knocking is generally {{more of a problem}} in forced induction engines rather than naturally aspirated, so this can help prevent it. On electronic ignition systems the ignition timing is generally retarded to prevent knock from occurring but with water injection it can be advanced closer to maximum brake <b>torque</b> (MBT) <b>timing</b> for additional power.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{analysis methods}} and results from slip-perturbed gait experiments. The risk for falls was related both to the conditions present at heel strike and {{to the nature of}} the response. Gait analysis was performed using the Human Movement and Balance Laboratory (HMBL) model, a fifteen segment, fourteen joint model of the human body that was developed as part of this thesis effort. Resulting kinematics and kinetics included three-dimensional angles describing relative segment rotations, segmental and whole-body centers-of-mass, and joint actuation torques for the entire body. The relationship between pre-slip gait characteristics and the magnitude of slips was explored for both younger and older adults. Slip severity, either hazardous or non-hazardous, was determined using a 1. 0 m/s peak slip velocity threshold. Hazardous slips were associated with greater step lengths normalized by leg length, larger and more rapidly changing foot-floor angles at heel strike, and increased cadence across the two subject groups. These results suggest that gait characteristics play an important role in the severity of slips. Older adults were found to walk with shorter step lengths and with smaller and more slowly changing foot-floor angles at heel strike compared to younger subjects, suggesting that age effects also impact slip severity. The effects of slipping and trailing leg response on slip outcome (falls or recoveries) were explored. Slip severity was found to be the most significant parameter related to outcome. Response strategies were classified, based on trailing leg dynamics, as either minimal, foot-flat, mid-flight, or toe-down. Slipping and trailing leg hip and knee torques were determined using the HMBL model and timing and magnitude parameters from these torques were then identified. Relationships between these parameters, age group (younger/older), response strategy, and outcome were then explored. Age was not found to be significantly related to response strategy or outcome, nor was response strategy found to be related to outcome. Slipping leg knee <b>torque</b> <b>timing</b> and magnitude parameters were related to slip severity and to outcome for hazardous slips.

Gasoline and its blends with 25 % ethanol and butanol at 25 % and 16 % per volume (the latter equivalent to 10 % ethanol blending ratio in terms of oxygen content) were studied in comparison to gasoline, ethanol, and butanol combustion. The same alcohol blending ratios were also employed with iso-octane as the base component for direct comparison. Testing was performed at 1500 RPM with 0. 5 bar intake plenum pressure using 20 °C or 80 °C engine coolant temperature.

The experimental investigations were carried out on a V 8 engine with port fuel injection and variable intake valve timing. The chemical limits of stable combustion {{have been shown to}} be a function of burned gas, fuel and air mixture. The widest limit, gas fuel ratio of 9 was found at maximum brake <b>torque</b> spark <b>timing.</b> Retarding the spark timing by 10 oCA caused a small reduction in the stable area, 20 oCA retard reduced the stable combustion area significantly, whereby stable combustion occurred within an area of gas fuel ratio of 10.

The increase in variability in the rapid burn period is greater than that associated with the flame development. The variability is magnified from flame development through the rapid burn phase.

40|$|Societal {{concerns}} on combustion-based {{fuel consumption}} are ever-increasing. With respect to internal combustion engines, this translates to {{a need to}} increase brake fuel conversion efficiency (BFCE). Diesel engines are a relatively efficient internal combustion engine to consider for numerous applications, but associated actions to mitigate certain exhaust emissions have generally deteriorated engine efficiency. Conventionally, diesel engine emission control has centered on in-cylinder techniques. Although these continue to hold promise, the industry trend is presently favoring the use of after-treatment devices which create new opportunities to improve the diesel engine's brake fuel conversion efficiency. This study focuses on injection timing effects on the combustion processes, engine efficiency, and the engine system's responses. The engine in the study is a medium duty diesel engine (capable of meeting US EPA Tier III off road emission standards) equipped with common rail direct fuel injection, variable geometry turbo charging, and interfaced with a custom built engine controller. The study found that injection timing greatly affected BFCE by changing the combustion phasing. BFCE would increase up to a maximum then begin to decrease as phasing became less favorable. Combustion phasing would change from being mostly mixing controlled combustion to premixed combustion as injection timing would advance allowing more time for fuel to mix during the ignition delay. Combustion phasing, in turn, would influence many other engine parameters. As injection timing is advanced, in-cylinder temperatures and pressures amplify, and intake and exhaust manifold pressures deteriorate. Rate of heat release and rate of heat transfer increase when injection timing is advanced. Turbocharger speed falls with the advancing injection <b>timing.</b> <b>Torque,</b> however, rose to a maximum then fell off again even though engine speed and fueling rate were held constant between different injection timings. Interestingly, the coefficient of heat transfer changes from a two peak curve to a smooth one peak curve as the injection timing is advanced further.
