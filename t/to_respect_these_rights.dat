States that are signatories of international conventions (such as the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) and other regional treaties containing similar provisions, are obliged <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> and protect <b>these</b> <b>rights.</b> <b>These</b> states are also obligated to protect <b>these</b> <b>rights</b> in domestic law {{and many of the}} ratifying States have included protection of <b>these</b> <b>rights</b> in their constitutions as fundamental freedoms.

40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements of The Bachelor of Laws Degree, Strathmore University Law SchoolThe {{freedom of the media}} and the right to access of information are deemed as core requirements for operations in a democratic society. As such, the freedom of the media and access to information are safeguarded in the Bill of Rights in the Kenyan Constitution, as well as other international statutes. However, the freedom of the media and the right to access information are not absolute rights as they are subject to limitation as prescribed in Article 24 of the Kenyan Constitution. This paper aims at discussing and elaborating on the instances where Article 24 should and can be properly applied. This is due to previous instances of the government overstepping their powers or failing to exercise their powers efficiently as required in Article 24 of the Kenyan Constitution. In this paper, I attempt to expound on the relationship between the freedom of the media and the right to access of information and the government’s duty <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> <b>these</b> <b>rights...</b>|$|E
40|$|There exist a {{great number}} of {{measurement}} projects intended to benchmark the human condition as it relates to aspirations of human dignity. One thing these efforts {{have in common is that}} they are indicators of outcomes, or records of events. Measuring outcomes is methodologically appropriate and substantively useful for a great variety of purposes. Further, some data projects include measures of legal guarantees, as well, to provide some proxy indicator of a state's intentions – often to be matched with the outcomes indicators to show gaps in law and practice as well as to examine limitations in a state's capacity to enforce law. However, the current attention being paid to economic human rights, or development rights, provides a distinct measurement challenge, as prevailing international law tasks states to do the best possible given extant resources. This is part of the framework of "progressive realization" of rights. Thus, outcomes measures of economic rights, typically based on wealth, are unfair to poorer states, by definition. In this paper, we propose a measurement of state effort to respect economic rights given available resources. We feel this substantively matches the progressive realization framework and alleviates the inequity of existing measures that are almost perfectly correlated with national wealth. As a demonstration, we produce effort scores for 100 + countries for the years 1990, 1995, and 2000. We also provide a simple examination of some possible associates of government effort <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> <b>these</b> <b>rights.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Protectionism: Applying Ethics Consistently {{focuses on}} the {{discrepancy}} between morality amongst human beings as opposed to morality with regard to all other life forms. The introduction explains important terminology, terms, methods and goals. The chapters that follow examine four prominent contemporary ethical theories that extend ethics to protect other life forms. Each chapter presents {{one of the four}} theories, immediately followed by a discussion of that theory. The first chapter discusses the work of Tom Regan, a philosopher who asserts that certain non-human animals hold rights, and that people are obligated to uphold corresponding duties <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> <b>these</b> <b>rights.</b> The second chapter examines the work of the philosopher Peter Singer, who recommends protection for some non-human animals based on sentience and utilitarian principles. The third chapter is dedicated to the work of Andrew Linzey, a theologian, who indicates a Christian obligation of servitude toward non-human animals based on Jewish and Christian scripture. The fourth chapter presents and examines the work of Paul Taylor, a philosopher who offers a theory of environmental ethics based on the inherent worth of certain plants and animals. The fifth chapter has two sections. Section A expands on Linzey's work to demonstrate consistency across faith traditions. Without focusing on any one tradition, this section highlights protectionist qualities within the Vedic/Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist, Islamic, and Indigenous religious traditions. Section B is an exercise in consistency in applied philosophy, which offers an ethical theory, the Minimize Harm Maxim. This theory is not my personal theory, but merely results from philosophic consistency and impartiality in applied ethics, based on current Western ethics regarding human life. The conclusion restates the ethical dilemma - a discrepancy in our current ethical system - and reaffirms the need for continued philosophical explorations of ethical theory and practice with regard to life, toward a morality that is less partial and more consistent...|$|E
40|$|Tax {{revenues}} {{constitute a}} large portion of budget revenues in Kosovo; therefore, an effective tax system is of utmost importance, especially since Kosovo remains a country in development. This report focuses on a specific section of the tax system which is the taxpayers’ rights, and analyzes cases where such a system fails <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> <b>these</b> <b>rights.</b> Specifically, the analysis is conducted by focusing on the level of education among taxpayers regarding their rights and cases of violations reported by taxpayers. This report presents a critical review of the factors leading to the violation of taxpayers’ rights and the consequences of such violations; and ultimately, it attempts to identify possible solutions for increasing the awareness among taxpayers of their rights and reducing the cases of their violation. This research is conducted using a qualitative methodology. It combines literature review and analysis of current Tax Administration of Kosovo (TAK) publications, the tax legislation of Kosovo, as well as a collection of primary data gathered through interviews and two small-scale surveys. Among the 11 interviews conducted, there are several stakeholders from the Ministry of Finance, Tax Administration of Kosovo as well as the business community. The surveys were conducted with two groups of taxpayers: large taxpayers, namely the corporations and small individual taxpayers. The information gathered from the surveys and interviews shows that there is a low level of awareness among taxpayers regarding their rights and there are issues with enforcing them, especially with inefficient investigation procedures. The greatest concern regarding taxpayers’ rights results to be the violation of the right to pay no more than the correct amount. By being illegitimately and unfairly charged more than the correct amount liable, taxpayers face unforeseen financial difficulties. In some cases this has resulted in significant losses for companies which have had to lay off employees and pay additional costs to defend themselves. Moreover, the right to appeal, which in principle should serve to protect taxpayers from any unjust and unlawful actions, is not exercised by taxpayers in many cases due to the long and costly procedure. As a result, complying with the law becomes more expensive for taxpayers, consequently creating barriers for doing business in Kosovo as well as incentives for evading taxes...|$|E
40|$|The {{human rights}} that are defended in libertarian {{literature}} {{tend to be}} limited in scope, which entails that the duties that people can be compelled to fulfil are similarly minimal. For this reason a commitment to libertarianism tends {{to be seen as}} incompatible with support for subsistence rights, enforceable positive duties, and redistributive taxation, since each one of these issues may require the infringement of libertarian property rights. In this thesis I aim to challenge these assumptions about libertarianism and to show that if a more plausible reading of libertarianism is adopted – {{what has come to be}} known as left-libertarianism – then this will generate a more substantial range of rights and correlative duties which are not only compatible with redistributive taxation, but in fact entail it. I show that libertarianism, despite its contention that human rights are exclusively negative, does not rule out subsistence rights provided that these are understood as negative rights, for example: a right not to be deprived of the means of subsistence, or deprived of a clean living environment. Negative rights can be violated not only by individuals or by institutions, but also by individuals supporting institutions. In order to respect the negative rights of others it is necessary to refrain from supporting or contributing to institutions that violate these rights. Moreover, failure <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> <b>these</b> <b>rights</b> brings about a positive duty of rectification, demonstrating the potential for positive libertarian duties even in the absence of positive rights. Since the manner in which rights can be violated is extensive, so is the scope of those individuals that owe rectification. The fundamental libertarian rights of self-ownership, which I characterise as three property rights – over the body, over the faculties (including talents, abilities and labour) and over what one can produce through exercising those faculties in conjunction with the body – demonstrate how we can come to have property rights over external objects, but self-ownership does not confer permanent private property rights over unlimited external worldly resources. In fact, a robust right of self-ownership is incompatible with the radically inegalitarian appropriation with which libertarianism is ordinarily associated. Given the equal rights of selfownership of every individual, it is far more plausible to conceive of the world as held in some egalitarian manner, rather than as unowned and available for appropriation in such a way that would disadvantage latecomers. I propose an egalitarian understanding of world ownership which comprises common ownership of land, and joint ownership of other external worldly resources such as oil and minerals. Taking the injustice of radically inegalitarian appropriation in conjunction with a duty to rectify past injustices, there follows a libertarian argument for redistribution, but crucially this redistributive taxation is collected not on income but on natural resource use. On a left-libertarian theory of rights, then, there is no right to appropriate unlimited resources, but there is a right to redistribution in the event of past injustices, including the misappropriation of worldly resources.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a cross-national {{investigation of}} the relationship between cultural heterogeneity and regimes' respect for basic human rights. The quantitative human rights literature has not yet addressed the question of whether high levels of cultural diversity are beneficial or harmful. My research addresses this gap. I address the debate between those who argue that diversity is negatively related to basic human rights protection and those who argue it is likely <b>to</b> improve <b>respect</b> for <b>these</b> <b>rights.</b> Ultimately, I propose that regimes in diverse countries will be less likely to provide an adequate level of subsistence (otherwise known as basic human needs) and security rights (also known as integrity of the person rights) to their citizens than regimes in more homogeneous countries. Using a data set of 106 non-OECD countries for the years 1983 and 1993, I employ bivariate, linear multivariate regression, and causal modeling techniques to test whether higher levels of ethnolinguistic and religious diversity are associated with less regime respect for subsistence and security rights. The analysis reveals that higher levels of cultural diversity do appear to lead <b>to</b> lower <b>respect</b> for subsistence rights. However, counter to the hypothesized relationship, high levels of diversity appear to be compatible with high levels of respect for security rights...|$|R

Aim of the research: The goal of the research was to determine patient’s rights awareness among obstetric patients as well as sources from which this knowledge came. After taking into account the state of knowledge about the patient’s rights based on opinions of respondents, their feelings related to a stay in a hospital were identified. Material and methods: The research was conducted in a group of 161 patients of maternity hospitals in Kielce. The research material was obtained by the author and anonymous questionnaire. The results were subjected to statistical analysis by a test chi^ 2 (c 2). Results: In the group of sample women, more than half (52. 8 %) did not know the patient's rights. Some of them (41 %) said that they have heard of those rights but cannot name any of them. 47. 2 % of the respondents mentioned by at least one right. The primary source of information about the patient's rights are TV and radio (43. 7 %). The midwife ranks last position among the available sources of information about the patient's rights. For the patients who know better their rights the midwife is often a source of information about them (19. 7 %) than for those who claimed that they have only heard about them, but they cannot name any of them (7. 6 %). The majority of the rights (4 - 5 < 5) were mentioned by the 12 (15. 8 %) patients, who in addition to the Internet 9 (75 %), a significant source of information indicated the midwife 8 (66. 7 %). Among women who did not know the patient's rights, more than half (65. 9 %) identified their stay in the maternity ward as not stressful, but among those who demonstrated a better understanding of the rights half (52. 6 %) constituted women who their stay in the hospital identified as stressful events. Conclusions: 	A level of the knowledge of the patient’s rights among the sample women is insufficient. 	The vast majority of the respondents learned about the patient’s rights in other way than that connected with the activities of the midwife. The most common are: TV, radio, the Internet, magazines. 	A level of information about the patient’s rights measured by a number of the said rights is better in case of the patients whose knowledge came from the midwife. 	 Patients who know what their rights are, expect a professional medical care - based on patients rights, if there is not like that, they describe their staying in hospital as stressful...|$|E
