50|$|The EMF of a {{transformer}} {{at a given}} flux density increases with frequency. By operating at higher frequencies, transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed {{to achieve the same}} impedance. However, properties such as core loss and conductor skin effect also increase with frequency. Aircraft and military equipment employ 400 Hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight. Conversely, frequencies used for some railway electrification systems were much lower (e.g. 16.7 Hz and 25 Hz) than normal utility frequencies (50-60 Hz) for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early electric traction motors. Consequently, the transformers used <b>to</b> <b>step-down</b> the high overhead line voltages (e.g. 15 kV) were much larger and heavier for the same power rating than those required for the higher frequencies.|$|E

40|$|Background: In cases using a budesonide/formoterol {{combination}} inhaler, {{many patients}} are started on fixed-dose treatment at 640 / 18 μg (4 puffs) daily, {{but there are}} no guidelines yet regarding the step-down method when control has been maintained. Methods: Patients with moderate asthma treated with either budesonide 400 μg and salmeterol 100 μg (GINA step 3 group) or salmeterol/fluticasone 250 at 2 puffs (GINA step 4 group) were enrolled and started on therapy of budesonide/formoterol 4 puffs. Thereafter, <b>step-down</b> <b>to</b> 2 puffs was performed if either of the following criteria was met at 8 -week intervals: fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) ≤ 28 ppb plus asthma control test (ACT) score≥ 22, or ACT score≥ 24 at 3 consecutive visits regardless of FeNO level. Thereafter, changes in ACT score, the number of acute exacerbations and reliever use, and FeNO level were monitored through 48 th week. Results: Fifty-one patients, 27 in step 3 group and 24 in step 4 group, underwent step-down. ACT scores and the number of reliever use remained stable in both groups even after step-down. In contrast, FeNO levels increased gradually in step 4 group, whereas in the step 3 group they increased immediately after step-down. <b>Step-down</b> was considered <b>to</b> be safely performed because the numbers of reliever use and those of moderate or more severe exacerbations during the 48 -week period has not changed significantly compared <b>to</b> before <b>step-down.</b> Conclusions: If complete control of asthma, not only of clinical symptoms but also airway inflammation, is achieved by 3 - 6 months of fixed-dose budesonide/formoterol 4 puffs/day, it should be possible <b>to</b> safely perform <b>step-down</b> <b>to</b> 2 puffs/day...|$|R
