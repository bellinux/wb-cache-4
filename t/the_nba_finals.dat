5000|$|After Michael Jordan retired, {{interest}} in <b>the</b> <b>NBA</b> declined, especially after <b>the</b> 1998-99 <b>NBA</b> lockout.

5|$|In {{his first}} NBA full season (1957–58), Russell {{became the first}} player in NBA history to average more than 20 rebounds per game for an entire season, a feat he {{accomplished}} 10 times in his 13 seasons.

He still holds the NBA record for rebounds in one half with 32 (vs. Philadelphia, on November 16, 1957). Career-wise in rebounds, Russell ranks second to Wilt Chamberlain in regular season total (21,620) and average per game (22.5), and he led the NBA in average rebounds per game four times.

Russell also had seven regular season games with 40 or more rebounds, <b>the</b> <b>NBA</b> <b>Finals</b> record for highest rebound per game average (29.5 rpg, 1959) and by a rookie (22.9 rpg, 1957).

The Heat went on to win Game 6 behind Wade's 36 points, taking the series 4–2, and Wade was presented with the Finals MVP trophy. He became the fifth youngest player in NBA history to capture NBA Finals MVP honors and recorded the third highest scoring average by a player in his first NBA Finals with 34.7 points per game.
