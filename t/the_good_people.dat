25|$|It {{unfortunately}} {{appears to}} us, and many residents of Bay County, that Dr. Siebert {{has become a}} scapegoat for those seeking a political solution to recent events, rather than a logical resolution based upon science and fact.

500|$|Itoi {{wrote the}} game's ending while {{overseas}} in Saipan before Mother 3 was cancelled. His Nintendo 64 version was darker, [...] "dirtier", and more upsetting, though {{the final version}} changed little in concept. The Nintendo 64 version was to be more vague and left to the player's imagination through its sparse dialogue. Itoi attributed the change in tone to his own growth and the character composition of the new development team. He {{said that he had}} not been changed by fans. Itoi always planned for the two brothers to fight each other, though he did not write the ending until after production had already begun, a process he compared with Hayao Miyazaki's. Itoi processed each line individually as he wrote the final scene, and later reflected on its moral content that bad people sometimes need even more help than <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>people.</b> He said that the one line that makes him most emotional is, [...] "You must be tired." [...] Itoi felt that the ending's renewal theme reflected his worldview of appreciating our time on Earth in light of the planet's inevitable end. Much {{of the rest of the}} script was written after-hours at a local hotel where they would continue their work.|$|E

2500|$|Survival was a moral {{as well as}} a {{physical}} struggle.

At least 2,505 people were sentenced for cannibalism in the years 1932 and 1933 in Ukraine, though the actual number of cases was certainly much higher.|$|E
2500|$|The {{administration}} of Lord North (1770â€“1782) tried {{to defeat the}} colonist rebellion by military force. British and American forces clashed in 1775 and, in 1776, came the American Declaration of Independence. Burke was appalled by celebrations in Britain of {{the defeat of the}} Americans at New York and Pennsylvania. He claimed the English national character was being changed by this authoritarianism. Burke wrote: [...] "As to <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>people</b> of England, they seem to partake every day {{more and more of the}} Character of that administration which they have been induced to tolerate. I am satisfied, that within a few years there has been a great Change in the National Character. We seem no longer that eager, inquisitive, jealous, fiery people, which we have been formerly".|$|E

2500|$|On March 26, Butch {{was greeted}} at Pearl Harbor by {{a horde of}} reporters and radio announcers.

On April 8, he thanked the Grumman Aircraft Corporation plant at Bethpage (where the F4F Wildcat was made) for 1,150 cartons of Lucky Strike cigarettes, a grand total of 230,000 smokes. Ecstatic Grumman workers had passed the hat to buy the cigarettes in appreciation of O'Hare's combat victories in one of their F4F Wildcats. A loyal Camel smoker, Butch opened a carton, deciding that it was the least he could do for <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>people</b> back in Bethpage. In his letter to the Grumman employees he wrote, [...] "You build them, we'll fly them and between us, we can't be beaten."
