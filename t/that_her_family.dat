5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.

Meanwhile, Pam starts to realize <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> may have to leave Scranton.|$|E
5|$|In direct {{opposition}} to the immense productivity that she displayed in the early 1860s, Dickinson wrote fewer poems in 1866. Beset with personal loss as well as loss of domestic help, Dickinson {{may have been too}} overcome to keep up her previous level of writing. Carlo died during this time after providing sixteen years of companionship; Dickinson never owned another dog. Although the household servant of nine years, Margaret O Brien, had married and left the Homestead that same year, it was not until 1869 <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> brought in a permanent household servant, Margaret Maher, to replace the old one. Emily once again was responsible for chores, including the baking, at which she excelled.|$|E
5|$|Marge {{dreams that}} she has {{sent a letter to}} Martha Stewart asking for her to help save the family's Christmas. Martha {{promptly}} arrives and fills the house with the Christmas decorations Marge has always dreamed of, but the other family members end up as part of the decorations instead of being able to enjoy the holiday with her. Marge quickly realizes that it is Homer and the children that make Christmas special for her, so Martha gets rid of all the decorations with a magic wand. Marge then wakes up on Christmas Day to find <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> has brought her the ingredients for breakfast in bed. Their attempts to cook it go awry, so they go out for breakfast instead.|$|E

She and Kiat Kun follow the girl home, but after {{realising}} {{her father is}} blind and <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> was in a more dire situation than theirs, they decide not to reclaim the shoes. However, a few days later, Seow Fang notices that her classmate is wearing a new pair; upon confronting her, she discovers that the girl has discarded the old pair at the kampung rubbish dump. The Chew siblings frantically search the rubbish dump for her shoes, but only discover them as they are destroyed during a trade unionist riot against a policeman (Wakin Chau).|$|E
5|$|Crane later becomes {{suspicious}} when {{he realizes}} the diagram made by Katrina he thought summoned the Horseman is {{really one of}} protection, and also that the corpse of Lady Van Tassel has a wound {{that seems to have}} been caused post-mortem. The corpse is revealed as that of a servant when Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) emerges alive to ambush Katrina. Lady Van Tassel tells Katrina <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> was driven from their ancestral home by the Van Garretts, who then sold it to the Van Tassels. She proceeded to pledge her soul to Satan and become a witch, summoning the Horseman to kill Van Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager who knew about his new will, marriage, and child, {{in order to be able}} to claim everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested. She then sends the Horseman after Katrina to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates.|$|E
5|$|No one at Truckee Lake {{had died}} during the interim between the {{departure}} of the first relief party and the arrival of the second relief party. Patrick Breen documented a disturbing visit in the last week of February from Mrs. Murphy, who said <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> was considering eating Milt Elliott. Reed and McCutchen found Elliott's mutilated body. The Alder Creek camp fared no better. The first two members of the relief party to reach it saw Trudeau carrying a human leg. When they made their presence known, he threw it into a hole in the snow that contained the mostly dismembered body of Jacob Donner. Inside the tent, Elizabeth Donner refused to eat, although her children were being nourished by the organs of their father. The rescuers discovered that three other bodies had already been consumed. In the other tent, Tamsen Donner was well, but George was very ill because the infection had reached his shoulder.|$|E
5|$|McMahon is a Republican, who {{alongside}} her husband donated $2,700 {{to the presidential}} campaign of Chris Christie. At a live event in Dublin, Ireland in 2004, Stephanie addressed to a crowd <b>that</b> she and <b>her</b> <b>family</b> are Irish-American and noted <b>that</b> <b>her</b> great-grandfather's <b>family</b> came from County Clare.|$|R

50|$|Evelin Lindner {{was born}} in 1954, into a family that was deeply scarred by the two World Wars, {{particularly}} World War II. Her parents were displaced from Silesia in 1946 to Lower Saxony, which later became part of West Germany. She has stated <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family's</b> traumatic experiences have formed the background of her work.|$|R
5|$|Slavery {{did not end}} in New York State until July 4, 1827, and, {{like many}} men of his day, Stanton's father was a slaveowner. Peter Teabout, a slave in the Cady {{household}} who was later freed in Johnstown, took care of Stanton and her sister Margaret. While she {{makes no mention of}} Teabout's position as a slave in her family's household, he is remembered with particular fondness by Stanton in her memoir, Eighty Years & More. Among other things, she reminisces about the pleasure she took in attending the Episcopal church with Teabout, where she and her sisters enjoyed sitting with him {{in the back of the}} church rather than alone in front with the white families of the congregation. It seems it was, however, not immediately the fact <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> owned at least one slave, but her exposure to the abolition movement as a young woman visiting her cousin, Gerrit Smith, in Peterboro, New York, that led to her staunch abolitionist sentiments.|$|E
25|$|Alma Thomas died on February 28, 1978 {{still living}} in the same house <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> moved into upon their arrival in Washington in 1906.|$|E

2500|$|After Liang Ji's death, Emperor Huan made Liang Mengnü empress. However, {{he disliked}} <b>her</b> <b>family</b> name and {{therefore}} {{ordered her to}} take the family name Bo (薄). [...] He later found out <b>that</b> <b>her</b> original <b>family</b> name was actually Deng, and therefore had <b>her</b> <b>family</b> name restored.|$|R
5000|$|On June 28, 2010, <b>her</b> <b>family</b> stated <b>that</b> in <b>her</b> last phone call, [...] "which was a month ago, Zeynab has {{mentioned}} {{that she is}} held in Evin Prison”. Since <b>that</b> time, <b>her</b> <b>family</b> or <b>her</b> lawyers {{had not been able}} to receive any further information, the authorities responding <b>that</b> <b>her</b> file had been lost.|$|R
25|$|Padilla's sister, Benita Padilla-Kirkland, {{told the}} South Florida Sun-Sentinel {{newspaper}} in 2004 <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> suspected {{that he was}} flying the aircraft and feared that he subsequently crashed somewhere in Africa or was being held against his will.|$|E
25|$|President Carter, {{referencing}} Coretta's lifelong {{struggle for}} civil rights, noted <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> {{had been the}} target of secret government wiretapping. Their somewhat critical remarks about US government policy were met with thunderous applause and standing ovations.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{death of}} a member, her badge is either sent to the Fraternity's {{archives}} or buried with her. Each member has the responsibility to see <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> knows of these alternatives, and should arrange to have {{one or the other}} followed at her death.|$|E

5000|$|Agnes Macphail {{was born}} to Dougald McPhail and Henrietta Campbell in Proton Township, Grey County, Ontario on March 24, 1890. (Although her surname was spelled [...] "McPhail" [...] at birth, she {{discovered}} {{during a trip to}} Scotland <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family's</b> surname had been [...] "Macphail" [...] and changed her name to reflect this.) She was raised in the Methodist Church, but converted to the Reorganized Latter Day Saint church as a teenager, the church of her missionary uncle.|$|R
25|$|McKay {{records that}} Walter Riddell of Newhouse, {{grandfather}} of Robert, married his cousin Anne and through her inherited {{the estate of}} Glenriddell <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> had held since {{not long after the}} reformation and the concurrent secularisation of the lands held by Melrose Abbey.|$|E
25|$|The 1900 census {{indicates}} <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> {{reported that}} Bessie Smith {{was born in}} Chattanooga, Tennessee, in July 1892. The 1910 census gives her age as 16, and a birth date of April 15, 1894 appears on subsequent documents and was observed as her birthday by the Smith family. The 1870 and 1880 censuses report three older half-siblings, but later interviews with Smith's family and contemporaries contain no mention of them among her siblings.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with other}} Ripper victims, Kelly's origins are obscure and undocumented, {{and much of}} it is {{possibly}} embellished. Kelly may have herself fabricated many details of her early life as there is no corroborating documentary evidence, but {{there is no evidence to}} the contrary either. According to Joseph Barnett, the man she had most recently lived with prior to her murder, Kelly had told him she was born in Limerick, Ireland, in around 1863—although whether she referred to the city or the county is not known—and <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> moved to Wales when she was young.|$|E
5000|$|She discovers <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family's</b> {{situation}} {{is very different}} {{than it was before}} the war. She meets her mother, Peggy Dickinson (Hayley Mills), and her new five-year-old brother, Charlie. As Rusty returns, her father, Roger Dickinson (Rupert Frazer), is still stationed as a soldier in Burma. When Japan surrenders he comes back home. His old-fashioned behavior and nature make him unhappy with his modern self-sufficient wife, his Americanised daughter and especially Charlie's dislike of his [...] "new" [...] father.|$|R
2500|$|The Oppenheimers' family company, Stemcor, {{which had}} been founded by Hodge's father, Hans Oppenheimer, was run by her brother, Ralph, until September 2013. In November 2012, Helia Ebrahimi, The Daily Telegraphs City Correspondent, {{raised the issue of}} Hodge's {{suitability}} as Chair of the Public Accounts Committee, reporting <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family's</b> company [...] "pays just 0.01pc tax on £2.1bn of business generated in the UK". This led to an investigation into the tax arrangements of a number of US companies operating in the UK.|$|R
5000|$|She {{has stated}} <b>that,</b> though <b>her</b> <b>family</b> is Catholic, {{she was never}} baptised and is not religious, instead agreeing with the {{statement}} that, [...] "we're just minuscule dots in the vast cosmic emptiness of the universe".|$|R
25|$|Shum was {{admitted}} to the intensive care ward at QMH on 22 January 2008 and checked out four days later. Shum's mother died in Canada, while Shum was in the hospital.

On 19 February, at 3am, her family decided that Shum's life support should be withdrawn. It was decided that her breathing apparatus would be removed and <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> spend time with her by her bedside. Shum died at 8:38a.m. (local time) on 19 February 2008.|$|E
25|$|Anjelica's mother, believing her {{likely in}} Mexico with the father, and also unable to {{communicate}} in English, never reported her missing. Margarita did claim {{that she and her}} family had searched for her daughter but were unable to locate her, for which she became the subject of much criticism and anger when Anjelica was identified in 2013. Other reports reveal <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> also neglected to report her missing, as some of the family members, including Margarita, were apparently illegal immigrants. They feared that if it was discovered that some were in the country illegally during the course of an investigation, they would be deported.|$|E
25|$|Lisbeth Hochsinger {{was born}} on 17 October 1918 in Graz, Austria. In 1936 she began {{studying}} medicine at the University of Graz where she completed {{three years of the}} course before being sent away from the threatening political situation in Hitler's Germany. She was unaware <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> had some Jewish ancestry, but later both her parents were taken to concentration camps where they died. With assistance from the Society of Friends, Hochsinger arrived in England in 1938 and went to Devon to stay with a brigadier and his wife. She first worked as a governess for their children and learned sufficient English to start nursing training in London.|$|E
