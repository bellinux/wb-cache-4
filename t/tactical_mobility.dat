5|$|On 13 February 1985, the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) was {{activated}} at Fort Drum, New York, {{after several}} decades inactive. In {{accordance with the}} Reorganization Objective Army Divisions plan, the division was no longer centered on regiments, instead two brigades were activated under the division. The 1st Brigade, 10th Mountain Division was activated at Fort Drum while the 2nd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division was activated at Fort Benning, moving to Fort Drum in 1988. The division was also assigned a round-out brigade from the Army National Guard, the 27th Infantry Brigade. The division was specially designed as a light infantry division able to rapidly deploy.

5|$|By {{the evening}} of 8 November, all the Ottoman {{positions}} of the Gaza to Beersheba line had been captured and the Eighth Army was in full retreat. In conjunction with the captures in {{the centre of the}} line at Sheria, the occupation of Gaza enabled a swift direct advance northwards, preventing a strong consolidation of the Wadi Hesi rearguard position. However, the Ottoman XXII Corps was not defeated at Gaza, but conducted a skillful, tactical retreat from the town, demonstrating both operational and <b>tactical</b> <b>mobility.</b> Late in the afternoon of 8 November, twenty-eight British and Australian aircraft flew over Huj, the headquarters of the Ottoman force, targeting German and Ottoman aerodromes, railway junctions, dumps, and troops in close formation with bombs and machine guns. Arak el Menshiye was raided twice during the day with two hundred bombs dropped, forty-eight hit ten hostile aircraft still on the ground. The next day, Et Tine was bombed, with at least nine hostile aircraft damaged. Virtually continual aerial attacks were made on railway stations, troops on the march and transport, while a German aircraft was shot down in flames near the Wadi Hesi.|$|E

25|$|The Ottoman XXII Corps was not defeated, but skillfully {{conducted}} a tactical retreat, demonstrating both operational and <b>tactical</b> <b>mobility.</b> The Yildirim Army Group had marched through the night, to gain distance {{and time to}} establish a light entrench line, behind which they resisted the EEF advance all day. Their further withdrawals were aided by their falling back on their lines of communication including railways, to eventually occupy strongly entrenched defences in the Judean Hills. While the sacrifice of the Ottoman rearguards delayed the pursuit and saved the Ottoman defenders from encirclement and destruction, the Gaza-Beersheba line was eventually completely overrun and 12,000 Ottoman soldiers would be captured.|$|E
25|$|The Field Test Group {{conducted}} {{a number of}} tests and exercise to evaluate {{the recommendations of the}} other groups. Using one battle group, resources from two others, and 150 aircraft (125 helicopters and 25 fixed-wing), the group conducted 40 field tests. Three of these were week-long tests; evaluating the ability of troops to function in swampy areas in Georgia, testing the concept in counter-guerrilla exercises in western Virginia, and finally a withdrawal under pressure scenario conducted in the Fort Bragg area. The tests used over 11,000 flying hours, many at low altitude and simulating combat conditions as much as possible. Smaller unit tests (16 in all) were conducted before these exercises, and a number of smaller tests took {{place at the same time}} to evaluate <b>tactical</b> <b>mobility,</b> firepower, reconnaissance, and logistics operations.|$|E
25|$|Gamelin was right; most reserve {{divisions}} had by {{now been}} committed. The only armoured division still in reserve, 2nd DCR, attacked on the 16th. However the French armoured {{divisions of the}} Infantry, the Divisions Cuirassées de Réserve, were despite their name very specialized breakthrough units, optimized for attacking fortified positions. They could be quite useful for defence, if dug in, but had very limited utility for an encounter fight: they could not execute combined infantry-tank tactics as they simply had no important motorized infantry component; they had poor <b>tactical</b> <b>mobility</b> as the heavy Char B1 bis, their main tank in which half of the French tank budget had been invested, had to refuel twice a day. So 2nd DCR divided itself in a covering screen, the small subunits of which fought bravely – but without having any strategic effect.|$|E

[...] The turret front is protected by [...] of steel armor at an angle of 32degrees.

500|$|This {{disagreement}} {{came to an}} end in September 1962. As part of {{the expansion}} of the military in response to Indonesia's policy of [...] "confrontation" [...] with its neighbours, the RAAF was directed by the government to conduct an urgent evaluation of short takeoff and landing aircraft and heavy-lift helicopters that could be purchased to improve the Army's <b>tactical</b> <b>mobility.</b> A team of seven RAAF officers headed by Group Captain Charles Read, the director of operational requirements, was immediately dispatched to the United States and assessed the Sikorsky S-61, Vertol 107-II and CH-47 Chinook helicopters. The team judged the Chinook to be clearly the most suitable of these types, and recommended that several be acquired; this was in line with the Army's preference. The government subsequently accepted a recommendation made by the RAAF to acquire a package of twelve Caribou fixed-wing aircraft and eight Chinooks, and placed an order for these aircraft within weeks of the evaluation. The Chinook order was subsequently cancelled by the government when it was learned that it would take several years for the helicopters to be delivered, and the RAAF's orders of Caribous and Bell UH-1 Iroquois tactical transport helicopters were instead expanded.|$|E

2500|$|The Turks, who had {{orders to}} ravage the Meander Valley {{as far as}} the sea-shore, sacked the Byzantine {{settlements}} of Tralles, Antioch, Louma and Pantacheir. As a result of these successes, they were loaded with plunder, including, rather poetically, water from the sea, an oar and shore sand. These burdens would have drastically slowed their progress and lessened their <b>tactical</b> <b>mobility.</b> The Seljuq army was returning towards Turkish territory when it approached a [...] "choke point" [...] in its journey where the great eastern highway crossed the Meander River by way of a bridge (probably ruined or semi-derelict), near the villages, or forts, of Hyelion and Leimocheir. The Byzantines had concealed themselves and were divided into two corps, separated by the river. They caught the Seljuq army in an ambush when it had partially crossed over the river, destroying it as a fighting force.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 July Hitler {{issued a}} new {{directive}} requiring the front in Normandy {{to be maintained}} since the German forces lacked the <b>tactical</b> <b>mobility</b> for a battle of manoeuvre and an invasion in the Pas de Calais was believed imminent.

To counter Luftwaffe air superiority, the commander of the 62nd Army, General Vasily Chuikov, ordered his troops to [...] "hug" [...] the Germans, negating German <b>tactical</b> <b>mobility.</b> The Luftwaffe suppressed Soviet artillery on the east bank of the Volga and caused many casualties during Soviet attempts to reinforce the defenders on the west bank. From mid-September until early November the Germans made three big attacks on the city and ground forward in mutually-costly fighting. By mid-November, the Soviets were penned into four shallow bridgeheads, with the front line only [...] from the river. Anticipating victory, substantial numbers of Luftwaffe aircraft were withdrawn to the Mediterranean in early November to support the Axis operations in Tunisia.
