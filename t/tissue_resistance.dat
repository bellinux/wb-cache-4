50|$|During {{critical}} illness, a {{state of}} adrenal insufficiency and <b>tissue</b> <b>resistance</b> to corticosteroids may occur. This has been termed critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency. Treatment with corticosteroids might be most beneficial in those with septic shock and early severe ARDS, whereas its role in others such as those with pancreatitis or severe pneumonia is unclear. However, the exact way of determining corticosteroid insufficiency remains problematic. It should be suspected in those poorly responding to resuscitation with fluids and vasopressors. ACTH stimulation testing is not recommended to confirm the diagnosis.

5000|$|Diabetes type II is a {{progressive}} pancreatic condition {{that tends to}} be induced by lifestyle factors. [...] "Obesity, lack of physical exercise and a poor diet are the major lifestyle factors that encourage this disease." [...] Genetic predispositions also play a role, however, not as significant as environmental causes. Diabetes among children, {{is on the rise}} within Australia, as revealed by a study in Western Australia in 2002.The study stated that 2 in every 100,000 {{children under the age of}} 18 in Australia were considered diabetic. The findings further suggested that Indigenous children were at a much higher risk, as 16 in every 100,000 children were considered to be diabetic. The condition is one where the body cells are unable to absorb sufficient amounts of insulin, due to <b>tissue</b> <b>resistance,</b> thus being unable to reduce blood sugar levels after eating. The body requires insulin produced by the pancreas, in order to uptake glucose within the cells for the production of energy (ATP) and to perform active processes within the body, such as digestion, muscle contraction and brain stimulation. Over time those susceptible will experience weight gain as well as nutritional gaps as they will be unable to adequately absorb nutrients required by the body. This is a fatal flaw in a developing child as it results in a failure to thrive and can potentially inhibit body development and cognitive functioning, due to cortical and muscular-skeletal atrophy. Diabetes can be controlled by lifestyle changes such as increased exercise as well blood glucose level monitoring. However, no definitive cure exists.|$|E
40|$|Insulin <b>resistance</b> in adipose <b>tissue</b> {{increases}} {{the release of}} free fatty acids into the circulation, which likely contributes to impaired insulin action in liver and skeletal muscle associated with obesity. However, reliable assessment of adipose <b>tissue</b> insulin <b>resistance</b> requires performing a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure {{in conjunction with a}} fatty acid tracer infusion to determine insulin-mediated suppression of lipolytic rate.

40|$|Insulin dysregulation is the {{hallmark}} of Equine Metabolic Syndrome and has received attention because of its direct association with laminitis. In the absence of an adequate treatment for laminitis, a focus on prophylaxis is needed, making early detection of individuals at risk of developing laminitis one of the main challenges in equine endocrinology. Recent studies have shown that insulin dysregulation goes beyond <b>tissue</b> insulin <b>resistance</b> and it is now demonstrated that the equine enteroinsular axis {{plays a major role in}} insulin secretion and equine hyperinsulinaemia.

40|$|Blackleg is {{a disease}} of potato, Solanum tuberosum, which {{is caused by the}} {{bacteria}} Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora (Ecc), E. c. subsp. atroseptica (Eca) or E. chrysanthemi (Ech). Incidence of blackleg negatively affects the quality of seed potatoes. Disease control relies on phytosanitary measures aiming to reduce the spread of the pathogen. Partial resistance has been identified but exploitation of genotypic variation has been hindered by the lack of efficient and accurate methods for measuring resistance. The partial resistance of 12 cultivars was studied in terms of components of resistance. Tuber <b>tissue</b> <b>resistance</b> was considered as a putative component and studied under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Significant and reproducible differences for resistance were found, but these differences had no explanatory value in relation to resistance to blackleg in the field. However, {{it was found that the}} mother tubers of plants in the field play a role in determining field resistance but that this role for a given cultivar can not be predicted from resistance screening under laboratory conditions. Another important component of resistance was found to be located in the stem base. When stem base resistance was measured by inoculation with Ech, this component accounted for 58 % and 65 % of the variance in field experiments for resistance to Eca and Ech, respectively. Resistance of the above ground stem tissue was of minor importance in determining blackleg resistance. A study on one first, and 11 second backcross populations which were derived from somatic hybrids between S. tuberosum and S. brevidens, revealed that relatively high levels of tuber <b>tissue</b> <b>resistance</b> could be found in this material. As for cultivars, no correlation was found between tuber <b>tissue</b> <b>resistance</b> and resistance to blackleg. It is doubtful whether the material is useful as a source of resistance to blackleg. In addition, attempts were undertaken to introduce resistance in potato cultivars by means of genetic transformation with constructs encoding the antibacterial peptides cecropin B, Î±-hordothionin and tachypiesin 1. Transcription of the cecropin B gene was found in transgenic plants but no expression of this peptide. This was probably a result of instability of cecropin B in potato tissue. Expression of Î±-hordothionin was found but the transgenic plants did not show enhanced resistance. Expression of tachypiesin 1 was detected in transgenic plants of cvs Bintje, Karnico and Kondor.

Our objective was {{to test the hypothesis}} of femoral, compared with abdominal, adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>resistance</b> to adrenergic stimulation in vivo as a possible mechanism. Methods Regional fatty acid trafficking, along with the measurement of adipose tissue blood flow (ATBF) with 133 Xe washout, was studied with the arteriovenous difference technique and stable isotope tracers in healthy volunteers. Adrenergic agonists (isoprenaline, adrenaline [epinephrine]) were infused either locally by microinfusion or systemically. Localmicroinfusion of adrenoceptor antagonists (propranolol, phentolamine) was used to characterise specific adrenoceptor subtype effects in vivo. Results Femoral adipose tissue NEFA release and ATBF were lower during adrenaline stimulation than in abdominal tissue (p< 0. 001). Mechanistically, femoral adipose tissue displayed a dominant a-adrenergic response during adrenaline stimulation. The a-adrenoceptor blocker, phentolamine, resulted in the 'disinhibition' of the femoral ATBF response to adrenaline (p< 0. 001).
