Amy's fiancé, Rory (Arthur Darvill), who had previously been erased from existence {{from one of the}} cracks in the universe, makes a return, though he is revealed to be an Auton duplicate outfitted with his consciousness.|$|E

Of these the chronology had already been accomplished, the account of the creation and the modern maps would appear in the atlas of 1595, his edition of Ptolemy appeared in 1578 but the ancient geography and the description of the heavens never appeared.|$|E

25|$|In December 1981, Guth read a {{paper from}} Moscow {{physicist}} Andrei Linde saying that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>universe</b> is within just one bubble, so nothing is destroyed by wall collisions. This conclusion was made using a Higgs field with an energy graph that was originally proposed by Sidney Coleman and Erick Weinberg. Guth discussed this with Linde, who had independently {{been working on}} bubble inflation, but without considering the flatness problem. Linde and Guth eventually exchanged papers on the subject.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Breuer in 1994 {{had proven}} that {{physical}} theories valid for <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>universe</b> are impossible. Any theory will be wrong {{when applied to}} a system which contains the observer himself due to self-reference. This proves that the observer's own body does not follow the same physical laws {{as the rest of}} the universe. But other people from the observer's point of view will obey the usual physical laws, so conducting experiments on them would not indicate any divergence from the physical predictions.|$|E
25|$|Such a test as {{described}} by R. Plaga would mean that energy transfer is possible between parallel worlds. This does not violate the fundamental principles of physics because these require energy conservation only for <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>universe</b> {{and not for the}} single parallel branches. Neither the excitation of the single ion (which is a degree of freedom of the proposed system) leads to decoherence, something which is proven by Welcher Weg detectors which can excite atoms without momentum transfer (which causes the loss of coherence).|$|E

25|$|Astrology (the {{operation}} of the stars): Hermes claims that Zoroaster discovered {{this part of the}} wisdom of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>universe,</b> astrology, and taught it to man. In Hermetic thought, {{it is likely that the}} movements of the planets have meaning beyond the laws of physics and actually hold metaphorical value as symbols in the mind of The All, or God.

25|$|In the {{original}} relative state formulation, Everett proposed {{that there is}} one universal wavefunction that describes the objective reality of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>universe.</b> He stated that when multiple subsystems interact, the total system becomes a superposition of these subsystems. This includes observers and measurement systems, which become part of one universal state (the wavefunction) that is always described via the Schrödinger Equation (or its relativistic alternative). That is, they become entangled such that one cannot define one without the other. Thus, each subsystems state can only be described relative to each subsystem with which it interacts (hence the name relative state).|$|E

60|$|We {{may take}} another {{illustration}} from {{the hypothesis of}} psycho-physical parallelism. Let us assume, {{for the purposes of}} this illustration, that to a given state of brain a given state of mind always corresponds, and vice versa, i.e. that there is a one-one relation between them, so that each is a function of the other. We may also assume, what is practically certain, that to a given state of a certain brain a given state of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> material <b>universe</b> corresponds, since it is highly improbable that a given brain is ever twice in exactly the same state. Hence there will be a one-one relation between the state of a given person's mind and the state of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> material <b>universe.</b> It follows that, if n states of the material universe are determinants of the material universe, then n states of a given man's mind are determinants of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> material and mental universe--assuming, that is to say, that psycho-physical parallelism is true.|$|R

500|$|Critics saw an [...] "undeniably" [...] Hindu {{connection}} between the film's story and the Vedic teaching of reverence for <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>universe,</b> {{as well as the}} yogic practice of inhabiting a distant body by one’s consciousness and compared the film's love scene to tantric practices. [...] Another linked the Na'vi earth goddess Eywa to the concept of Brahman as the ground of being described in Vedanta and Upanishads and likened the Na'vi ability to connect to Eywa with the realization of Atman. [...] One commentator noted the parallel between the Na'vi greeting [...] "I see you" [...] and the ancient Hindu greeting [...] "Namaste", which signifies perceiving and adoring the divinity within others.

500|$|Chrysippus {{taught that}} ethics {{depended}} on physics. In his Physical Theses, he stated: [...] "for {{there is no}} other or more appropriate way of approaching the subject of good and evil on the virtues or happiness than from the nature of all things and the administration of the universe." [...] The goal of life, said Chrysippus, is to live in accordance with one's experience of the actual course of nature. A person's individual nature is part of the nature of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>universe,</b> and thus life should be lived in accordance with one's own human nature {{as well as that of}} the universe. Human nature is ethical, and humanity is akin to the Divine, emanating from the primal fire or aether, which, though material, is the embodiment of reason; and people should conduct themselves accordingly. People have freedom, and this freedom consists in emancipation from irrational desires (lust, riches, position in life, domination, etc.) and in subjecting the will to reason. Chrysippus laid the greatest stress on the worth and dignity of the individual, and on the power of will.|$|E

500|$|Used in {{the opening}} sequence, [...] "Die Another Day" [...] was played 13minutes into the film, where Bond is shown imprisoned and being {{tortured}} {{for over a year}} in a prison camp in Korea. Being a departure from the normal title sequence of the previous Bond films, Madonna faced difficulty in making the song blend with the theme of Die Another Day. Nevertheless, she understood the idea behind the opening scenes and tweaked the song accordingly. Some of the lyrics like [...] "I'm gonna destroy my ego ... Sigmund Freud ... Analyze this" [...] were derived from Madonna's interpretation of the film's storyline. She told an interviewer from Genre magazine that the lyrics were about [...] "destroying your ego, and it's juxtaposing the metaphor of, you know, the fight against good and bad, and it's set inside <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>universe</b> of Bond". [...] "Die Another Day" [...] was never adapted into the main score of the film.
