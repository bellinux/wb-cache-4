5|$|When Lee and Jude {{leave for}} <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>to</b> {{stay with her}} parents so that Tim can work without {{distraction}} on the family's taxes, he invites a group of friends—including Ray (Sam Rockwell), Phil (Mike Birbiglia), Adam (Kent Osborne), and Paul (Steve Berg)—to {{the house for the}} night. After a few drinks, they decide to dig up the backyard together, quickly finding another bone and a license plate. Phil, who is skeptical about the digging, leaves with Adam and Paul as Alicia (Anna Kendrick), Max (Brie Larson) and Billy (Chris Messina) arrive at the house. Billy pairs off with Alicia and Ray with Max while Tim continues to dig. He finds a shoe before deciding to go to sleep.|$|E
5|$|Writer Howard Gordon {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the episode while he was walking down the streets of New York and noticed several stone gargoyles on the corner staring at him. Gordon developed the idea into an X-File involving possession by a gargoyle spirit. He wrote a draft script for the episode but had to turn to series creator Chris Carter three days before production began in order to rework it. The two worked on the script over <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>to</b> add more psychological aspects to the episode. Gordon claimed to be very proud of the final product. Assistant Art Director Gary Allen drew the gargoyle sketches used in this episode.|$|E

25|$|Woods {{returned}} {{ahead of}} schedule at the 2014 Quicken Loans National. However he struggled with every aspect of his game, missing the halfway cut. His next appearance came at the third major of the year – the Open Championship. This took place at Hoylake – location of his 2006 victory. Despite a strong start, Woods faded over <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>to</b> eventually finish 69th. Woods' back pain was clear to see at the 2014 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, where he withdrew from the tournament. Against all expectations, Woods made an unexpected appearance just one week later at the final major of the year, competing at the PGA Championship. Woods though would miss the cut.

The band would minimize {{the impact of the}} situation in future interviews and remained vague regarding his departure. Initial news reports explained that Raynor had [...] "reportedly returned to school." [...] DeLonge would later explain the drinking problem that led to his expulsion: [...] "One show he dropped his sticks 10 times. It was so disturbing to see someone ruining himself."

He accepts. Examining the company {{financial}} records, Bert Cooper (Robert Morse) finds Lane's forged check and accuses Don of giving an unauthorized Christmas bonus. Don calls Lane into his office, shows him the check and serves him a drink. Lane pretends to be ignorant at first, but then apologizes while arguing that he was only taking his own money that he had previously invested and for which he had not been compensated. Don demands his resignation and gives him <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>to</b> think of an [...] "elegant exit", assuring him that this is the worst part of starting over.

500|$|Raynor {{suffered}} a [...] "tragic loss" [...] during the West Coast minitour and flew home, forcing the band {{to find a}} fill-in drummer: Travis Barker of the ska punk support band The Aquabats. Barker learned the drum tracks for the band's set in only 45 minutes prior to his first show. Raynor returned for the band's Hollywood Palladium performance, and the band became increasingly uneasy and arguments grew worse. To offset personal issues, Raynor began to drink heavily and it began to affect the band's performances. Following a largely successful Australian tour in the spring, Hoppus and DeLonge presented an ultimatum: quit drinking or go to an [...] rehab. Raynor agreed to both and informed the band of his decision after taking <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>to</b> mull options.

He also started deejaying, {{breaking into a}} friend's home while he was away for <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>to</b> practice on his turntables and eventually going on to practice freestyle deejaying {{every day for a}} whole summer. Goldstein started using crack cocaine by the age of 20. He said that consuming the drug and deejaying were [...] "about all he did" [...] {{for the next four years}} of his life. He would often disappear from friends and family for days at a time. In 1997, he attempted suicide; the gun jammed in his mouth as he pulled the trigger. Shortly afterwards, a friend encouraged Goldstein to become sober. He began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, avoided his friends who still took drugs, and dedicated himself to working as a DJ. Goldstein relapsed after 90 days though subsequently restarted and completed the program. People who complete the AA program are encouraged to sponsor other addicts through the recovery process; Goldstein became a sponsor for several people.|$|E

500|$|In July 1957, Monk {{began to}} perform at the venue for six months with saxophonist John Coltrane, bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik, and drummer Shadow Wilson in his group. However, by the time Monk's {{employment}} there ended in December, he had lost Wilson to poor health, while Coltrane left {{in pursuit of a}} solo career and a return to Miles Davis's group. After returning to New York City's club scene with a new quartet, Monk received an eight-week offer from Joe and Iggy Termini to play the Five Spot Café beginning on June 12, 1958. He played most nights during <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>to</b> capacity crowds with Abdul-Malik, drummer Roy Haynes, and tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin, who had performed with Monk before. Griffin was unfamiliar with all of his repertoire and, like Coltrane, found it difficult to solo over Monk's comping during their first few weeks: [...] "Any deviation, one note off, and you sound like you're playing another tune, and you're not paying attention to what's going on. And it's so evident ... there's no space." [...] During their performances, Monk often left the stage for a drink at the bar or danced around, which gave Griffin an opportunity to play with more space. However, the quartet eventually developed a sufficient rapport and grasp of the set list.|$|E
500|$|During {{filming of}} the pilot episode, Whedon was still arguing with Fox that the show should be {{displayed}} in widescreen format. Consequently, he purposely filmed scenes with actors on the extreme edge of both sides {{so that they could}} only be shown in widescreen. This led to a few scenes on the DVD (and later Blu-ray) where objects or setups that were not visible in the original 4:3 broadcasts were now displayed—such as the scene in the pilot where Wash mimes controlling the ship with a non-existent yoke. However, the pilot was rejected by the Fox executives, who felt that it lacked action and that the captain was too [...] "dour". They also disliked a scene in which the crew backed down to a crime boss, since the scene implied the crew was [...] "being nothing". Thus, Fox told Whedon on a Friday afternoon that he had to submit a new pilot script on Monday morning or the show would not be picked up. Whedon and Tim Minear closeted themselves for <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>to</b> write what became the new pilot, [...] "The Train Job". At the direction of Fox, they added [...] "larger than life" [...] characters such as the henchman [...] "Crow", and the [...] "hands of blue" [...] men, who also introduced an X-Files-type ending.|$|E
500|$|Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp had {{attempted}} to persuade EastEnders writer Tony Jordan to develop a spin-off for their characters, which would star Windsor as Peggy. The idea never advanced beyond informal discussions, but when the producers decided to reintroduce Peggy, McFadden and Kemp suggested Windsor play her. Windsor had previously {{expressed a desire to}} join the cast of EastEnders. Chat show host Chris Evans of Channel 4's The Big Breakfast made a public broadcast instructing viewers to fax or phone the BBC with pleas for Windsor's instatement. However, Windsor was already in negotiations with the BBC about appearing in the serial. June Deitch, the EastEnders casting director, had met with Windsor to discuss the matter, and was convinced when Windsor declared that she would [...] "like to play my own age for a change". At the time, the producers had already thought about reintroducing Peggy, and Windsor was cast despite originally being considered too [...] "well-known". Windsor has spoken of her [...] "terrified" [...] reaction to being asked to audition, commenting: [...] "I had <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>to</b> prepare and I cried all the time. I didn't know how to do soap acting. I was so used to using my hands, my eyes." [...] She auditioned with two scenes, one emotion, one [...] "jolly" [...] which Windsor has described as [...] "agony", explaining: [...] "I was afraid of playing Barbara Windsor, so when I had to laugh I went 'huh, huh'. Anything rather than 'tee, hee, hee'." [...] In an interview with the Walford Gazette, a US-based newspaper dedicated to EastEnders, Windsor commented on her casting: [...] "I was thrilled, I could rest my tired bones working on a marvelous television show that I deeply respected. I was very excited about the possibility [...] playing this feisty lady who would come in and shake up her two boys' lives." ...|$|E

500|$|Heading {{into the}} new season, {{attention}} also focused on the McLaren team and its driver Nigel Mansell. He was initially announced as the partner of Mika Häkkinen; however, {{a week before the}} first race, McLaren announced that Mansell would not compete in the first two races of the new season, as he could not fit into the MP4/10 car. Mansell's arrival at McLaren was due to demand from the team's sponsors, including Philip Morris, whose brand, Marlboro, was on the car, who wanted to enjoy the publicity associated with the [...] World Champion's return even if it meant him performing worse than teammate Häkkinen. His place at McLaren for the first two races was taken by the team's test driver, Mark Blundell, as McLaren worked to build a wider monocoque to accommodate Mansell. McLaren were also concerned about the standard refuelling equipment provided for 1995 by suppliers Intertechnique, having suffered a major leak in a test of the new rig outside of its factory. Intertechnique had redesigned the fuel equipment, which was used by all of the teams, {{in the wake of a}} pit lane fire suffered by driver Jos Verstappen during the previous year's German Grand Prix. The new fuel rigs, in addition to being half the size of the 1994, also featured longer nozzles, and were designed to lock onto the car before any fuel could begin to flow. Intertechnique traced the problem to a faulty valve within the equipment, which caused [...] of fuel to leak, and modified the parts accordingly. Intertechnique and the FIA advised the teams to refuel the cars slowly and carefully during pitstops to avoid any further leaks, a situation that was considered unsatisfactory by many of the team principals and mechanics. A new regulation for 1995 also mandated the teams' fuel suppliers to send samples of their fuel to the FIA prior to each Grand Prix, which the governing body would use as a reference when conducting fuel tests at the event itself. Thus only fuel approved by the FIA in advance was allowed; any deviations from the samples on file was not permitted. As before, all cars were subject to routine fuel tests as part of the scrutineering process throughout <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>to</b> ensure compliance with the sport's technical regulations. The rule change had been proposed by the Elf oil company in 1993 and unanimously supported by the other F1 suppliers in order to speed up the fuel-testing process.|$|E
