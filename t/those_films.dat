5|$|For the 79th Academy Awards, {{which were}} held on February 25, 2007, the Academy invited 83 {{countries}} to submit films for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, including Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan, which {{were invited to}} submit a film {{for the first time}} in the history of the Academy. Sixty-three countries submitted films to the Academy and sixty-one of <b>those</b> <b>films</b> were accepted for review by the Academy, a record number for the time. The submissions of Finland and Luxembourg were rejected before the formal review process.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} three years of the awards, actresses were {{nominated}} as the best in their categories. At that time, all of their work during the qualifying period (as many as three films, in some cases) was listed after the award. However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of <b>those</b> <b>films</b> was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on the ballots.|$|E
5|$|Kadhalikka Neramillai was {{released}} on 27 February 1964 and was applauded for its comedy; it was a commercial success, running in theatres for more than 175 days. It has also received wide appreciation from contemporary critics and film personalities. Regarded as a trend-setting comedy, the film has since developed a cult status in Tamil cinema. Its success led to a Telugu remake Preminchi Choodu (1965) and a Hindi remake Pyar Kiye Jaa (1966). The Telugu remake was directed by P. Pullaiah while the Hindi remake was directed by Sridhar. Rajasree reprised her role in both <b>those</b> <b>films.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>those</b> <b>film</b> fragments, the complete soundtrack {{of the film}} and the trailer survived because it was re-recorded on Vitaphone disks for theaters {{that did not have}} optical sound systems, such as the Movietone system, which MGM usually utilized.|$|R
5000|$|This EP was {{released}} on November 14, 2012 in Japan by EMI Records Japan, in regular and limited CD/DVD format, featuring official music videos and <b>those</b> <b>filmed</b> in studio along featured artists. It is also available worldwide as a digital release on iTunes Store.|$|R
50|$|The {{show was}} criticized after filming a March 2013 {{immigration}} raid where eight workers were arrested. Criticisms included {{the lack of}} informed consent for <b>those</b> <b>filmed</b> and that the filming constituted an invasion of privacy. Also at issue was the government's involvement in the show as then-Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews had approved filming.|$|R
5|$|Hydrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{technological}} important impurities in semiconductors, including diamond. Hydrogen-related defects are very different in natural diamond and in synthetic diamond films. <b>Those</b> <b>films</b> are produced by various chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen (typical hydrogen/carbon ratio >100), under strong bombardment of growing diamond by the plasma ions. As a result, CVD diamond is always rich in hydrogen and lattice vacancies. In polycrystalline films, much of the hydrogen may be located at the boundaries between diamond 'grains', or in non-diamond carbon inclusions. Within the diamond lattice itself, hydrogen-vacancy and hydrogen-nitrogen-vacancy complexes have been identified in negative charge states by electron paramagnetic resonance. In addition, numerous hydrogen-related IR absorption peaks are documented.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} three years of the awards, actors were {{nominated}} as the best in their categories. At that time, all of their work during the qualifying period (as many as three films, in some cases) was listed after the award. However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of <b>those</b> <b>films</b> was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on the ballots. The following year, this unwieldy and confusing system was replaced by the current system in which an actor is nominated for a specific performance in a single film. Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937, the category was officially limited to five nominations per year.|$|E
5|$|When Broccoli and Saltzman {{bought the}} rights to {{existing}} and future Fleming titles, it did not include Casino Royale, which had already been sold to producer Gregory Ratoff, with the story having been adapted for television in 1954. After Ratoff's death, the rights were passed on to Charles K. Feldman, who subsequently produced the satirical Bond spoof Casino Royale in 1967. A legal case ensured that the film rights to the novel Thunderball were held by Kevin McClory as he, Fleming and scriptwriter Jack Whittingham had written a film script upon which the novel was based. Although Eon Productions and McClory joined forces to produce Thunderball, McClory still retained {{the rights to}} the story and adapted Thunderball into 1983's Never Say Never Again. The current distribution rights to both of <b>those</b> <b>films</b> are held by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the studio which distributes Eon's regular series.|$|E
50|$|While Geoff {{began with}} {{pre-recorded}} phrases, Thompson voiced him live in studio for almost every episode since late June 2011, including <b>those</b> <b>filmed</b> in Paris, France and Scotland. Three {{people are often}} given screen credit {{at the end of}} the show as being responsible for Geoff: Imahara, writer Tom Straw (and later Bob Oschack), and voice actor Thompson.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film has}} not been widely {{screened}} in Egypt, but has been lauded by international audiences. Variety magazine finds that the cinematography was able to capture beautiful shots and sounds in cramped spaces while maintaining an atmosphere of ease and authenticity amongst <b>those</b> <b>filmed.</b> Hot Docs echoes these sentiments on cinematography, stating that the film captures “breathtaking images.” ...|$|R

25|$|Vyjayanthimala married Chamanlal Bali in 1968. After marriage, {{she gave}} up her acting career and moved to Chennai. However, between 1968 and 1970, she shot for <b>those</b> <b>films</b> which she had signed before her marriage, such as Pyar Hi Pyar, Prince and Ganwaar. They have a son, Suchindra Bali. In 2007, she {{published}} her autobiography, titled Bonding, with Jyoti Sabarwal as co-writer.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} a success and seven more films {{followed}} in quick succession. George Sanders took over the lead role from Hayward and did it for five of <b>those</b> <b>films,</b> while Hugh Sinclair portrayed Templar in the two last. Several of the films were original stories, sometimes based upon outlines by Charteris while others were based loosely on original novels or novellas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} to [...] "Every Rose" [...] {{was similar to}} <b>those</b> <b>filmed</b> for other 1980s power ballads. It {{features}} Michaels in a cowboy hat and country attire sitting down on a stool playing the guitar and singing along to the song in a dimly lit room with one strobe light, interspersed with various clips from the band's 1988 tour.|$|R

50|$|Nina Hagen is a German singer, {{songwriter}} and actress. She {{made her}} acting debut on the German television series ABC der Liebe in 1974. Subsequently, {{she appeared in}} a number of films produced in former East Germany, such as Heiraten weiblich (1975), Heute ist Freitag (1975), Liebesfallen (1976), and Unser stiller Mann (1976). In <b>those</b> <b>film</b> she often appeared alongside her mother and actress Eva-Maria Hagen.|$|R
25|$|On November 20, 2012, The Hollywood Reporter {{reported}} that Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg will write and produce Episodes VIII and IX. Kasdan and Kinberg were later confirmed as creative consultants on <b>those</b> <b>films,</b> {{in addition to}} writing standalone films. In addition, John Williams, who wrote the music for the previous six episodes, has been hired to compose the music for Episodes VII, VIII and IX.|$|E
25|$|Kermode and Mayo {{have also}} {{appeared}} on The Culture Show with a segment called 'The Screening Room', held in various locations, where films were discussed with an audience before clips of <b>those</b> <b>films</b> were shown. Kermode {{also has a}} blog on the BBC website, called 'Kermode Uncut', where he invites discussion from viewers and often continues or begins discussions which relate back to the radio show.|$|E
25|$|Rickles {{appeared}} in the popular Beach Party film series. He recalled in his 2007 memoir that at a White House dinner, Barbara Bush teased him about his decision to appear in <b>those</b> <b>films.</b> Rickles' agent, Jack Gilardi, was married to Annette Funicello when Rickles was cast in the Beach Party films. He subsequently began appearing more frequently on television talk shows, first appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1965.|$|E

This phenomenon was also reported by Da Belo et al. [9] on Ni- 20 % Cr alloy in pH 9.2 borate buffer. For <b>those</b> passive <b>films</b> formed at higher potentials (0.2, 0.26 and 0.34 V), {{there was no}} clear potential range over which the capacitance varies slightly.

2500|$|Much of the show's {{format is}} divided up into segments, {{switching}} between <b>those</b> <b>filmed</b> within the programme's main studio, and pre-recorded films conducted before the broadcast of an episode; such films include car reviews and major features. The most common segments {{used in the}} show are [...] "Car Reviews", [...] "Power Laps", [...] "Star in a Reasonably Priced Car", [...] "Cool Wall", [...] "Challenges" [...] and [...] "Races".|$|R
50|$|In 2016, he {{directed}} Nessie & Me, marking {{the first time}} that {{he directed}} a children's film. The character Jack O’Grady directly references Wynorski's earlier films Dinocroc vs. Supergator and Piranhaconda when he encounters Nessie at the start of the film, hinting that Nessie & Me is canon to <b>those</b> <b>film</b> series, as well as Monster Cruise, with many characters from it appearing it Nessie & Me as well.|$|R
25|$|The {{sequel to}} Charlie's Angels {{followed}} in 2003, and {{although not as}} successful as the first, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003) also made over $250 million worldwide. Shortly thereafter, Sony extended its first-look production deal with Wonderland Sound and Vision for an additional three years, with Hot Wheels, Airshow, and Radiant on their film slate. Since then, none of <b>those</b> <b>films</b> have been developed with the former, which was previously {{supposed to be a}} directing vehicle for him in 2003 (he later chose to produce instead in 2006), being put into turnaround in 2009.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} {{historic}} films also {{emerged as an}} important genre in the Portuguese industry, as a medium for the state party to develop its nationalist propaganda and conservative values, namely As Pupilas do Senhor Reitor (1935), Bocage (1936), Amor de Perdição (1943), Inês de Castro (1945), Camões (1946) and Frei Luís de Sousa (1950). A subgenre of these nationalist films were those related {{to the culture of}} Fado and the rise to popularity of Amália Rodrigues, the great name of Portuguese song. Some of <b>those</b> <b>films</b> were Capas Negras and Fado, História de Uma Cantadeira, both from 1947.|$|E
25|$|The second first-person {{narration}} we {{have from}} Alhambra is altogether different from the first – here we are not offered her history, but rather a history of 20th century cinema – a past which she seems to adopt as her own, {{as if she were}} each of the characters in <b>those</b> <b>films.</b> “The Middle” deals, again, with each of the family members’ experiences of Amber: she throws Astrid’s camera off a bridge into the road, she seduces Magnus, and reveals flaws in Eve and Michael’s relationship. “The Middle” ends with Eve throwing Amber out of their holiday home.|$|E

5|$|The first {{performances}} {{by the full}} line up of Buena Vista Social Club, including Cooder, were <b>those</b> <b>filmed</b> by Wenders in Amsterdam and New York. Other international shows and T.V. appearances soon followed with varying line ups. Ibrahim Ferrer and Rubén González performed together in Los Angeles in 1998 to an audience that included Alanis Morissette, Sean Combs, and Jennifer Lopez, Ferrer dedicating the song Mami Me Gusto to the Hispanic Lopez.|$|R
25|$|Also part of {{the library}} are most films in the David O. Selznick library, the Cinerama Productions/Palomar {{theatrical}} library (with the exception of <b>those</b> <b>films</b> produced in Cinerama which are now {{under the control of}} Pacific Theatres and Flicker Alley), the Selmur Productions catalog that the network acquired some years back, and the in-house productions it continues to produce (such as America's Funniest Home Videos, Grey's Anatomy, General Hospital, and ABC News productions), although Disney–ABC Domestic Television (formerly known as Buena Vista Television) handles domestic television distribution, while Disney–ABC International Television (formerly known as Buena Vista International Television) handles international television distribution.|$|E
25|$|I have an {{obsession}} with death and sex. Those two things are also the nexus of horror films, which I've been obsessing over lately. I’ve been watching horror movies and 1950s science fiction movies. My re-release is called The Fame Monster so I've just been sort of bulimically eating and regurgitating monster movies and all things scary. I've just been noticing a resurgence of this idea of monster, of fantasy, but {{in a very real}} way. If you notice in <b>those</b> <b>films,</b> there’s always a juxtaposition of sex with death. That's what makes it so scary. Body and mind are primed for orgasm and instead somebody gets killed. That's the sort of sick, twisted psychological circumstance.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{being part of the}} basis for Baum's The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays, Land of Oz was the final 1910 Selig Polyscope Oz film, and has been brought to the screen several additional times. The Land of Oz, a Sequel to the Wizard of Oz was a two-reel production by the Meglin Kiddies made in 1931 and released in 1932. The film was recently recovered, but the soundtrack of the second reel is missing. The Wonderful Land of Oz (1969) was a studio-bound production from independent filmmaker Barry Mahon, which starred his son, Channy, as Tip. Mahon had previously produced nudie films; however, <b>those</b> <b>films</b> were made in New York, while Oz was made in Florida, and neither Caroline Berner (as Jinjur) nor the rest of her army were drawn from his former casts. Filmation's Journey Back to Oz (1971), recast the army of revolt with green elephants and Tip with Dorothy, but was essentially an unaccredited adaptation of this book. Elements from this novel and the following one, Ozma of Oz, were incorporated into the 1985 film Return to Oz featuring Fairuza Balk as Dorothy. It is also adapted in Ozu no Mahōtsukai and the Russian animated film, Adventures of the Emerald City: Princess Ozma (2000).|$|E
50|$|A Robert Honorary Award may {{be given}} to film {{professional}} whose {{many years in the}} film industry deserves recognition and praise. It is also with this award, the Film Academy may choose to honour <b>those</b> <b>film</b> professionals that can not be nominated for a Robert within the existing categories - casting director, line producing, poster designers and so on. The price is always given with a motivation and traditionally awarded at the Robert-party.|$|R

5000|$|On occasion, long-running {{television}} series, particularly <b>those</b> <b>filmed</b> {{in front}} of a live audience, have featured a theater-style curtain call at the conclusion of their runs, with the cast breaking character and often showing the audience and crew. The final episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, entitled [...] "The Last Show" [...] was a famous example of this. Since then, this term has been, more or less, associated with the series finale of a particular show.|$|R
