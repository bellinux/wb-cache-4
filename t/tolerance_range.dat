5000|$|For example, if a shaft with {{a nominal}} {{diameter}} of 10 mm {{is to have}} a sliding fit within a hole, the shaft might be specified with a <b>tolerance</b> <b>range</b> from 9.964 to 10 mm (i.e. a zero fundamental deviation, but a lower deviation of 0.036 mm) and the hole might be specified with a <b>tolerance</b> <b>range</b> from 10.04 mm to 10.076 mm (0.04 mm fundamental deviation and 0.076 mm upper deviation). This would provide a clearance fit of somewhere between 0.04 mm (largest shaft paired with the smallest hole, called the [...] "maximum material condition") and 0.112 mm (smallest shaft paired with the largest hole). In this case the size of the <b>tolerance</b> <b>range</b> for both the shaft and hole is chosen to be the same (0.036 mm), meaning that both components have the same International Tolerance grade but this need not be the case in general.|$|E

50|$|The ISO {{system uses}} an {{alpha-numeric}} code {{to illustrate the}} tolerance ranges for the fit, with the upper-case representing the hole tolerance and lower-case representing the shaft. For example in H7/h6 (a commonly-used fit) H7 represents the <b>tolerance</b> <b>range</b> of the hole and h6 represents the <b>tolerance</b> <b>range</b> of the shaft. These codes {{can be used by}} machinists or engineers to quickly identify the upper and lower size limits for either the hole or shaft. The potential range of clearance or interference can be found by subtracting the smallest shaft diameter from the largest hole, and largest shaft from the smallest hole.|$|E

30|$|Because the {{presented}} {{model was}} built with climatic, tree cover, and elevation data layers, and it employed the continental range, it mainly allowed for drawing {{conclusions about the}} possible climatic preferences of the species (see Dungan et al. 2002).

Higher frequency of fires disrupts the life cycle processes of the thick-billed grasswren, as well as the plants and macroinvertebrates that they depend on.

50|$|Interchangeability {{relies on}} parts' {{dimensions}} falling within the <b>tolerance</b> <b>range.</b> The most common mode of assembly is {{to design and}} manufacture such that, as long as each part that reaches assembly is within tolerance, the mating of parts can be totally random.

50|$|In contrast, in dynamic logic, {{there is}} not always a {{mechanism}} driving the output high or low. In the most common version of this concept, the output is driven high or low during distinct parts of the clock cycle.

50|$|The way {{in which}} male and female fit together, {{including}} play and friction, is classified (categorized) in thread standards. Achieving a certain class of fit requires {{the ability to work}} within <b>tolerance</b> <b>ranges</b> for dimension (size) and surface finish.

5000|$|There {{is another}} mode of assembly, called [...] "selective assembly", which gives {{up some of}} the {{randomness}} capability in trade-off for other value. There are two main areas of application that benefit economically from selective assembly: when <b>tolerance</b> <b>ranges</b> are so tight that they cannot quite be held reliably (making the total randomness unavailable); and when <b>tolerance</b> <b>ranges</b> can be reliably held, but the fit and finish of the final assembly is being maximized by voluntarily giving {{up some of the}} randomness (which makes it available but not ideally desirable). In either case the principle of selective assembly is the same: parts are selected for mating, rather than being mated at random. As the parts are inspected, they are graded out into separate bins based on what end of the range they fall in (or violate). Falling within the high or low end of a range is usually called being heavy or light; violating the high or low end of a range is usually called being oversize or undersize. Examples are given below.|$|R
50|$|Prevailing torque differentiates a locknut from a free {{spinning}} nut {{based on}} a value of how much torque is required during installation before clamp loading.

This torque value is usually not very high relative to final installation torque. <b>Tolerance</b> <b>ranges</b> for torque are specified in some standards such as (ISO, DIN, IFI, ASME, SAE, AN-, MS-, NAS- NASM-).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{influences}} of geometrical parameters like adhesive layer thickness and gap-filling on the mechanical properties of adhesively bonded joints are investigated {{by means of}} experimental studies with controlled parameter variations. In addition, corresponding simulation models are used to analyse these effects. As a result, the behaviour of joints under variation of manufacturing parameters can be reproduced with high accuracy. Furthermore, the validated simulation models are used to perform sensitivity analysis on a component-like specimen. Based on these studies, <b>tolerance</b> <b>ranges</b> can be specified and robust design optimisation can be carried out...|$|R

40|$|Drill-life {{testing is}} being used in {{industry}} to assess the performance of advanced surface coatings on cutting tools. However, it has been long recognized that such testing suffers {{from the fact that}} nominally similar drills with identical GP-twist drill design are subject to some variability in as-manufactured drill point features, that can give rise to large differences in tool-life. In the present study a brief review is presented made of previous investigations which looked at the specifications and measurement of prominent drill point features on GP-twist drills. This is followed by an overview of current practices in the production of GP-twist drills. Finally, results are presented of prominent drill point features measured on a batch of GP-twist drills. Production and design tolerances representing process capability ranges for drill point features were estimated and found to be within the <b>tolerance</b> <b>ranges</b> as specified by the drill manufacturer. Variations due to drift and machine setting changes were found to be negligible ie statistically not significant with a confidence level at 95 % or higher.
