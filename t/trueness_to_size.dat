40|$|Fiano {{is a white}} grapevine variety from {{southern}} Italy, in the Campania region around Naples. It produces the prestigious wine Fiano di Avellino and, {{as is the case}} with many old varieties in Europe, it has been known under a number of synonyms. There is a growing interest in Fiano in Australia, with some lovely complex and textural wines produced from initial plantings in diverse regions, including McLaren Vale and Langhorne Creek, in South Australia. However, during the workshop ‘A little southern Italy in the Barossa’ held in the Barossa Valley in January, there was some discussion regarding the variety of Fiano from around Avellino and the variety known as Fiano Aromatico (aromatic Fiano), Fiano Minutolo or Minutolo, found on the eastern side of southern Italy, in the Puglia region. It was also referred to in the workshop as Fiano di Bari, which is most likely an erroneous short form referring to Fiano from the province of Bari, in Puglia. The question was raised about whether the variety from Puglia was the same as the Fiano from Campania and, if it was different, what were the Fianos we had in Australia. In order to ensure which variety or varieties are in Australia, an international comparison was carried out between Italy, Australia and France, utilising the commercial DNA testing facility in Montpellier, France. This DNA testing also ﬁtted in with the ‘Ensuring <b>trueness</b> <b>to</b> type of some alternative varieties’ project funded by the GWRDC and other industry bodies (see the November/December issue, pages 54 - 58, and this issue, pages 52 - 56, of the Wine & Viticulture Journal), with the testing of the extra Fiano material funded by Adelaide Hills Vine Improvement Inc. (AHVII). Fiano is one of a number of varieties that are new to commercial Australian viticulture, and there is no knowledge of what it should look like. In light of the recent Savagnin/Albariño situation, it was important to conﬁrm the identity of a variety that is likely to be planted in increasing numbers before too many vineyards are planted.

It is my purpose in this paper to prove that Schiller's superior mental ability is also shown in his feminine characters.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Apple (Malus pumila Mill.) and pear (Pyrus communis L.), {{commonly}} known as pome fruits, are important deciduous fruit crops in South Africa. The challenges of climate change, disease incidence, distant markets and fluctuating consumer preferences necessitate new cultivars. The Agricultural Research Council (ARC) Infruitec-Nietvoorbij conducts a breeding programme aimed at developing new cultivars that are well adapted, resistant to pests and diseases and good storage potential. A recent review of the pome fruit gene banks, the breeders’ raw material, revealed misidentification and poor characterisation limitating the efficiency of its utilisation. To address these problems, the current study used microsatellite markers <b>to</b> investigate the <b>trueness</b> <b>to</b> type of accessions in the ARC gene banks. In addition, accessions of apple identified as true to type, were genotyped for the ACS 1 gene involved with ethylene production and fruit ripening. Two sets of 12 microsatellite markers recommended by a European working group on Pyrus/Malus, one for apple and one for pear, were utilised to fingerprint 540 apple and 197 pear accessions. Eleven and eight of 12 markers, were used respectively to successfully discriminate across the apple and pear accessions, {{with the exception of}} clones and sports of particular cultivars. Where possible, fingerprints were compared with those of their reported parents. The use of recommended markers facilitated the comparison of ARC pear accessions with those of the collection in Brogdale (UK). <b>Trueness</b> <b>to</b> type of accessions were established and misidentified accessions were also detected. A similar comparison will be conducted for apple when the Brogdale apple accessions fingerprints become available. Several accessions were found to be false, 78 apple and 22 pear, and removal from the collection was recommended. For ACS 1 genotyping of 292 apple accessions, customised fluorescently labelled ACS 1 -Pr were used rather than the published ACS 1 - 5 primers. Of the 292 apple accessions, 29 were homozygous for the b allele associated with low ethylene and good storage potential. Novel size variation in one allele of the ACS 1 gene, was detected in some Malus species and ornamental hybrids. Successful amplification in a multiplex reaction was achieved and proves to be a cost effective method for simultaneous molecular fingerprinting and ACS 1 genotyping. True to type material will facilitate confident use of genetic resources in the breeding programmes, and the ACS 1 genotypes will identify candidate parents for developing good storage performing cultivars for distant markets.

40|$|Background: Miscanthus is {{a leading}} second {{generation}} bio-energy crop, which is currently planted using rhizomes; however, increasingly the use of seed is being explored to improve efficiency of propagation. Miscanthus seed are small, germination is often poor and without sterilisation so germination detection must be sufficiently adaptable for example to {{the presence or absence}} of mould. Results: Machine learning using k-NN improved the scoring of different seed phenotypes encountered in scoring germination for Miscanthus. The k-NN-based algorithm was effective in scoring the germination of seed images when compared with human scores of the same images. The trueness of the k-NN result was 0. 69 to 0. 7, as measured using the area under a ROC curve. When the k-NN classifier was tested on an optimised image subset of seed an area under the ROC curve of 0. 89 was achieved. Conclusions: With non-ideal seed images that included mould and broken seed the k-NN classifier was less consistent with human assessments. The most accurate assessment of germination with which to train classifiers is difficult to determine but the k-NN classifier provided an impartial consistent measurement of this important trait. It was more reproducible than the existing human scoring methods and was demonstrated to give a high degree of <b>trueness</b> <b>to</b> the human score. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|To {{reduce the}} level of {{redundancy}} {{in a collection of}} cultivated lettuce, data from 160 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fragments and 10 polymorphic microsatellites were used in combination with passport data and morphological data, the latter obtained from an experimental field trial performed for verification purposes. Based on the observed distribution of the number of marker differences between and within accessions, a minimum of three AFLP differences and two microsatellite differences were regarded as levels warranting distinction between accessions in the redundancy analysis. The strategy followed in the redundancy analysis was mainly based on the confirmation of duplication by each of two independently generated data sources. The molecular data were used for the validation as well as the identification of potential duplicates, revealing a total number of 198 redundancies, corresponding to 12. 9 % of the total collection. <b>Trueness</b> <b>to</b> type, number of characterization and evaluation data, and collection management considerations, such as available seed quantities and germination percentages, were used as primary, secondary and tertiary criteria to decide which accession from duplication groups to maintain in the collection.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of the Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) dates back to 1984. The idea was to virtually assemble all accessions maintained in the worldwide existing collections to face genetic erosion. In many cases synonymy, homonymy and misnaming hampered the clear assignment of cultivars/accessions to prime names. In the past 15 years nuclear microsatellites, in particular the nine SSR-markers VVS 2, VVMD 5, VVMD 7, VVMD 25, VVMD 27, VVMD 28, VVMD 32, VrZAG 62 and VrZAG 79 were extensively applied for cultivar recognition in combination with ampelography. Genetic fin- gerprints of more than 15, 000  cultivars/accessions were collected. They were taken from more than 300 articles and from microsatellite databases on the web. Allele sizes were adapted according to own internal reference varieties. Comparison of profiles revealed new identities like: “Corbeau” = “Sevilhao”, “Gragnelut” = “Fer”, “Beretinjak” = “Bianco d’Alessano”. The activities aim to equip the prime names of VIVC with reliable genetic profiles combined with the validation of their identity by ampelography. Fingerprints from 1, 500 cultivars were already uploaded in VIVC. Two distinct search modules were imple- mented: “Microsatellites by varieties” and “Microsatellites by profiles”. The implementation assists the management of grape- vine genetic resources, e. g. <b>trueness</b> <b>to</b> type assessment in grapevine collections and serves research and breeding...|$|R
5000|$|In 1916, Gallatin had {{dismissed}} modernists {{in general}} and cubists in particular as immature. He thought their work to be half-baked, mediocre, and depressing. By {{the middle of the}} 1920s, through the influence of Nevinson, of the critic, Clive Bell, and of the authors of articles in The Arts magazine, he had thoroughly revised his opinions. Nevinson showed that cubism was not a gimmick, but a technique that emerged naturally from the art of its time. Bell articulated a formalist aesthetic that coincided with Gallatin's belief that art was not good because of its realism, but because the two-dimensional space of the painting, drawing, or print possessed a satisfying composition, line, shape, color, and texture. Pictorial representation, <b>trueness</b> <b>to</b> life, and the illusion of depth were secondary concerns. Bell also voiced an opinion that seems to have been latent in Gallatin's thought as well: good art is well-ordered rather than chaotic and it proceeds from the artist's thought processes and intuitive sense of rightness more than his emotions. William Zorach and other authors of articles in The Arts discussed an art of [...] "purely abstract forms and colors" [...] that, through an elimination [...] "of everything not vitally necessary," [...] produced a true art. The difficulty of judging what is a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and what is an [...] "abortion" [...] is no different for abstract than it is for representational art: it takes experience, careful study, and [...] "listening to one's inner response." ...|$|R

Cost action FA 1003 - GRAPENET. East-West Collaboration for Grapevine Diversity Exploration and Mobilization of Adaptive Traits for Breeding. The Near East {{and in particular}} Caucasus region are considered as the cradle of viticulture and the area of domestication. Already in the 1920 ’s Negrul first suggested the Caucasus as the grapevine gene centre.

Being both gene and domestication centre for grapevine a genetic wealth is highly expected in that area. A survey of the grapevine genetic resources present in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Russian Federation and Ukraine which took place from 2003 to 2007 in the scope of the project “Conservation and Sustainable Use of Grapevine Genetic Resources in the Caucasus and Northern Black Sea Region” was funded by the government of Luxembourg and managed by Bioversity.
