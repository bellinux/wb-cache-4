The <b>tube</b> <b>expanding</b> percentages within the ranges of expanding pressure from 160 MPa to 300 MPa for different materials joints were obtained. Both pull-out and push-out tests were carried out for each joint. Results show that the <b>tube</b> <b>expanding</b> percentage almost increases linearly with increasing the expansion pressures. Pull-out force is less than the push-out force and both of them increase with increasing expansion pressures. However unlimited increase of the <b>tube</b> <b>expanding</b> percentage cannot always enhance the pull-out strength of the joints because of “over-expansion”. Finally, to facilitate the application, the relationships between the <b>tube</b> <b>expanding</b> percentage and expanding pressure are given, and also provided are the equations {{of the relationship between the}} pull-out force and the <b>tube</b> <b>expanding</b> percentage...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{new kind}} of {{hierarchical}} tube with a negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) is proposed. The first level tube is constructed by rolling up an auxetic hexagonal honeycomb. Then, the second level tube is produced by substituting the arm of the auxetic sheet with the first level tube and rolling it up. The Nth () level tube can be built recursively. Based on the Euler beam theory, the equivalent elastic parameters of the NPR hierarchical tubes under small deformations are derived. Under longitudinal axial tension, instead of shrinking, all levels of the NPR hierarchical <b>tubes</b> <b>expand</b> in the transverse direction. Using these kinds of auxetic tubes as reinforced fibers in composite materials would result in a higher resistance to fiber pullout. Thus, this paper provides a new strategy for the design of fiber reinforced hierarchical bio-inspired composites with a superior pull-out mechanism, strength and toughness.

40|$|Abstract: Tube {{hydroforming}} with radial crushing (THFRC) {{process is}} particularly {{applicable to the}} tube which is difficult to shape {{due to lack of}} axial feeding. In this paper, the formability of the circular <b>tube</b> <b>expanded</b> into a triangle cross-section under the simple loading paths is explored by using the numerical simulation. The effect of the forming mode and the loading paths on bulged profile, wall-thickness distribution and the potential fracture location of the bulged tube are analyzed. The results showed that constraint conditions at tube ends have small influence on the bulged profile and wall-thickness distribution. Moreover, the larger the peak value of the internal pressure is, the better material filling ability and higher accurate the tube bulged profile are. Furthermore, the higher forming accuracy, the better material filling ability and wall-thickness distribution are gained in THFRC than those in free hydro-bulging (FHB) process, and they can be obtained under constant than linear pressure loading paths. Finally, the potential fracture location of the bulged tube in THFRC process is quite different from that in FHB process...|$|R
