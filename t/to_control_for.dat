5|$|Early studies {{reported}} high success rates: {{in one study}} in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a cohort of patients recently treated by the physician (what {{is known as a}} retrospective study) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from selection bias, as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>for</b> this bias, modern study design prefers a prospective cohort (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).|$|E

25|$|The {{classical}} {{description of}} a healthy human male prostate portrays it as slightly larger than a walnut. The mean weight of the normal prostate in adult males is about 11grams, usually ranging between 7 and 16grams.

25|$|A 2010 study {{confirmed}} the beneficial effect of moderate alcohol consumption on mortality. Subjects were grouped into abstainers, light, moderate, and heavy drinkers.

This study specifically sought <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>for</b> confounding factors including the problem of ex-drinkers considered as non-drinkers. According to another study, drinkers with heavy drinking occasions (six or more drinks at a time) have a 57% higher all-cause mortality than drinkers without heavy drinking occasions.|$|E

25|$|Flight of the Switchblade was {{scheduled}} for 2020 with its 61-meter long oblique wing perpendicular to its engines like a typical aircraft. As the aircraft increased speed, the wing begins to pivot, so that when it breaks the sound barrier, its wing has swiveled 60 degrees, with one wingtip pointing forward and the other backward. The change in aerodynamics and the general structure {{would have made the}} aircraft very difficult <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>for</b> a human being. The plane was to be totally controlled by an on-board computer controlling flight parameters. Following Phase I the aircraft concept was cancelled in 2008.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{separating}} {{church and state}} is often credited to the writings of English philosopher John Locke (1632–1704). According to his principle of the social contract, Locke argued that the government lacked authority {{in the realm of}} individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others <b>to</b> <b>control.</b> <b>For</b> Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority. These views on religious tolerance and the importance of individual conscience, along with his social contract, became particularly influential in the American colonies and the drafting of the United States Constitution.|$|E
25|$|Another terminological {{difference}} {{is known as}} tension (UK) and gauge (US). Individual crocheters work yarn with a loose or a tight hold and, if unmeasured, these differences can lead to significant size changes in finished garments that have {{the same number of}} stitches. In order <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>for</b> this inconsistency, printed crochet instructions include a standard for the number of stitches across a standard swatch of fabric. An individual crocheter begins work by producing a test swatch and compensating for any discrepancy by changing to a smaller or larger hook. North Americans call this gauge, referring to the end result of these adjustments; British crocheters speak of tension, which refers to the crafter's grip on the yarn while producing stitches.|$|E

40|$|The paper reports micro-econometric {{evidence}} on {{the factors that influence}} the ability of the self-employed to generate employment for others. In particular it investigates the contributions of financial and entrepreneurial capital to job creation. Housing wealth appears to be the most significant component of financial capital, why the demonstration effect of an employer father provides the most significant component of entrepreneurial capital. These and other influences are particularly important for the transition from sole trader to small-scale employer. These conclusions appear robust <b>to</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>for</b> any bias that may arise from the self-employed being a selected group in terms of advantage over the employed in ability to create jobs, and <b>to</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>for</b> unobserved latent entrepreneurial ability.

25|$|Within the {{literature}} {{it has been}} found that certain species of paridae and corvidae (such as the black-capped chickadee and the scrub jay) are able to use spatial memory to remember where, when and what type of food they have cached. Recent studies with rats and squirrels, have also suggested that they are able to use spatial memory to locate previously hidden food. Experiments using the radial maze have allowed researchers <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>for</b> a number of variables, such as the type of food hidden, the locations where the food is hidden, the retention interval, as well as any odour cues that could skew results of memory research. In particular, studies have indicated that rats have memory for where they have hidden food and what type of food they have hidden. This is shown in retrieval behaviour, such that the rats are selective in going more often to the arms of the maze where they have previously hidden preferred food than to arms with less preferred food or where no food was hidden.|$|E
500|$|The HZ-1 Aerocycle, {{also known}} as the YHO-2 and by the manufacturer's {{designation}} DH-4 Heli-Vector, was an American one-man [...] "personal helicopter" [...] developed by de Lackner Helicopters in the mid-1950s. Intended to be operated by inexperienced pilots with a minimum of 20 minutes of instruction, [...] the HZ-1 was expected to become a standard reconnaissance machine with the United States Army. Although early testing showed that the craft had promise for providing mobility on the atomic battlefield, more extensive evaluation proved that the aircraft was in fact too difficult <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>for</b> operation by untrained infantrymen, and after a pair of crashes the project was abandoned. A single model of the craft was put on display.|$|E
500|$|In late 2006, Ken MacLeod, a geology {{professor}} from the University of Missouri, completed {{an analysis of}} sediment below the ocean's surface, bolstering the single-impact theory.

The analysis revealed there was only one layer of impact debris in the sediment, which indicated there was only one impact. Multiple-impact proponents such as Gerta Keller regard the results as [...] "rather hyper-inflated" [...] and do not agree with the conclusion of MacLeod's analysis, arguing that there might only be gaps of hours to days between impacts in a multiple-impact scenario (cf. Shoemaker-Levy 9) which would not leave a detectable gap in deposits.|$|E

Michael Fassbender provided multiple versions of his performance as Jobs, which Graham and Boyle would then choose from during post-production.
