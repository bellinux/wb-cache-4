5000|$|Through the {{addition}} of derivational morphology (internal changes to verb stems and/or prefixes), verbs may be made passive, reflexive, causative, frequentative, reciprocal, or reciprocal causative: [...] fälät-u they knew, [...] tä-fält-u they were known, [...] ’a-fält-u <b>they</b> <b>caused</b> to know (<b>they</b> introduced), [...] tä-falät-u they knew each other, [...] ’a-f-falät-u <b>they</b> <b>caused</b> to know each other.|$|R
5000|$|The causative {{morpheme}} {{can also}} be used recursively to generate indefinitely long words that are grammatically valid. This morpheme shows quite some irregularity, taking one of six forms depending on the verb root. Otherwise it alternates between -DIr (D=d or t, I=ı,i,u or ü) and -t depending on the preceding letter. piş-ir-di-ler = they cooked it piş-ir-t-ti-ler = <b>they</b> <b>caused</b> it to be cooked (they had it cooked) [...] piş-ir-t-tir-di-ler = <b>they</b> <b>caused</b> it to be caused to be cooked (they had someone have it cooked) piş-ir-t-tir-t-ti-ler = <b>they</b> <b>caused</b> it to be caused to be caused to be cooked (they had someone have someone have it cooked) piş-ir-t-tir-t-tir-di-ler = <b>they</b> <b>caused</b> it to be caused to be caused to be caused to be cooked (they had someone have someone have someone have it cooked)Multiple usage of this suffix is rare, but there is no theoretical reason to put a limit to its use.|$|R

5|$|All {{anticoagulants}} {{are generally}} contraindicated {{in situations where}} the reduction in clotting that <b>they</b> <b>cause</b> might lead to serious and potentially life-threatening bleeds. This includes people with active bleeding conditions (such as gastrointestinal ulcers), or disease states with increased risk of bleeding e.g. low platelets, severe liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension. For patients undergoing surgery, treatment with anticoagulants is generally suspended. Similarly, spinal or lumbar puncture (e.g. spinal injections, epidurals, etc.) carry increased risk so treatment is suspended prior to these procedures.|$|E
5|$|As for the Harii, {{quite apart}} from their strength, which exceeds {{that of the other}} tribes I have just listed, they pander to their innate savagery by skill and timing: with black shields and painted bodies, they choose dark nights to fight, and by means of terror and shadow of a ghostly army <b>they</b> <b>cause</b> panic, since no enemy can bear a sight so {{unexpected}} and hellish; in every battle the eyes are the first to be conquered.|$|E
5|$|Climate-related natural {{disasters}} cause massive losses of Indian life and property. Droughts, flash floods, cyclones, avalanches, landslides {{brought on by}} torrential rains, and snowstorms pose the greatest threats. Other dangers include frequent summer dust storms, which usually track from north to south; <b>they</b> <b>cause</b> extensive property damage in North India and deposit large amounts of dust from arid regions. Hail is also common in parts of India, causing severe damage to standing crops such as rice and wheat.|$|E

5|$|Due to its perception-altering effects, {{the onset}} of {{narcosis}} {{may be hard to}} recognize. At its most benign, narcosis results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and mastery of the environment. These effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide. They also resemble (though not as closely) the effects of alcohol or cannabis and the familiar benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and alprazolam. Such effects are not harmful unless <b>they</b> <b>cause</b> some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed. Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same at a given depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E
5|$|Laws {{have been}} passed {{in many areas of}} the world to protect bears from habitat destruction. Public {{perception}} of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance. Support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies. Where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans. In poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears and the economic costs <b>they</b> <b>cause</b> to farmers and ranchers.|$|E
5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, <b>they</b> <b>cause</b> internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E

5|$|Modelling {{the disease}} in various types of animals, such as the {{transgenic}} mouse developed in 1996, enabled larger scale experiments. As these animals have faster metabolisms and much shorter lifespans than humans, results from experiments are received sooner, speeding research. The 1997 discovery that mHTT fragments misfold led {{to the discovery of}} the nuclear inclusions <b>they</b> <b>cause.</b> These advances have led to increasingly extensive research into the proteins involved with the disease, potential drug treatments, care methods, and the gene itself.|$|E
5|$|Nutria were {{introduced}} into coastal marshes from South America in the mid-1900s, and their population has since exploded into the millions. <b>They</b> <b>cause</b> serious damage to coastal marshes and may dig burrows in levees. Hence, Louisiana {{has had a}} bounty to try to reduce nutria numbers. Large American alligators, however, feed heavily on nutria, so American alligators may not only control nutria populations in Louisiana, but also prevent them spreading east into the Everglades. Since hunting and trapping preferentially take the large American alligators that {{are the most important}} in eating nutria, some changes in harvesting may be needed to capitalize on their ability to control nutria.|$|E
5|$|Sectors of {{the food}} {{industry}} (manufacturing and retail) have pledged {{to reduce the amount}} of food they directly waste, and additionally what <b>they</b> <b>cause</b> households to waste indirectly. This is planned to happen through a combination of: effective labeling, pack size range, storage advice and packaging that extends the duration of food freshness. The latest initiative in May 2009, rather than a new policy, is seen as an expansion to ongoing attempts to reduce the wider food packaging. The aim is to cut UK household food waste by 155,000 tonnes (2.5% of total waste) before the end of 2010 by helping UK households prevent food going to waste.|$|E

The flesh is extremely peppery, but this offensive taste, along with its toxicity, can be removed by parboiling or pickling. Although {{it used to be}} widely eaten in Russia and eastern European countries, it is generally not recommended for consumption. There are many similar Russula species that have a red cap with white stem and gills, some of which can be reliably distinguished from R.emetica only by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} of bubble formation {{and the damage}} <b>they</b> <b>cause</b> {{has been the subject}} of medical research for a considerable time and several hypotheses have been advanced and tested. Tables and algorithms for predicting the outcome of decompression schedules for specified hyperbaric exposures have been proposed, tested, and used, and usually found to be of some use but not entirely reliable. Decompression remains a procedure with some risk, but this has been reduced and is generally considered acceptable for dives within the well-tested range of commercial, military and recreational diving.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} types of plant virus, but often <b>they</b> <b>cause</b> only a loss of yield, {{and it is not}} {{economically}} viable to try to control them. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by organisms, known as vectors. These are normally insects, but some fungi, nematode worms, and single-celled organisms {{have been shown to be}} vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical, for perennial fruits, for example, efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds. Plant viruses cannot infect humans and other animals because they can reproduce only in living plant cells.|$|E

5|$|There is {{controversy}} as {{to whether}} VAD {{is more common in}} men or in women; an aggregate of all studies shows that it is slightly higher incidence in men (56% versus 44%). Men are on average 37–44 years old at diagnosis, and women 34–44. While dissection of the carotid and vertebral arteries accounts for only 2% of strokes (which are usually caused by high blood pressure and other risk factors, and tend to occur in the elderly), <b>they</b> <b>cause</b> 10–25% of strokes in young and middle-aged people.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin is {{contraindicated}} in pregnancy, as {{it passes}} through the placental barrier and may cause bleeding in the fetus; warfarin use during pregnancy is commonly associated with spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, and preterm birth. Coumarins (such as warfarin) are also teratogens, that is, <b>they</b> <b>cause</b> birth defects; the incidence of birth defects in infants exposed to warfarin in utero appears to be around 5%, although higher figures (up to 30%) {{have been reported in}} some studies. Depending on when exposure occurs during pregnancy, two distinct combinations of congenital abnormalities can arise.|$|E
5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as <b>they</b> <b>cause</b> the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E
