5|$|From various {{symbolic}} motifs the tapestries seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> {{to celebrate}} a marriage, probably that of Anne of Brittany (1477–1514) and Louis XII of France (1462–1515). The royal arms of Louis and Anne would have once decorated the sky {{in most of the}} tapestries.|$|E
5|$|The Skelmanthorpe Flag is {{believed}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> in Skelmanthorpe, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, in 1819. It {{was in part}} made to honour {{the victims of the}} Peterloo Massacre.|$|E
50|$|Formal written Afrikaans also {{admits the}} {{construction}} of was gemaak to indicate passive voice in the pluperfect, {{which in this case}} corresponds <b>to</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made.</b> The meaning of the sentence can change based on which auxiliary verb is used (is/was), e.g. is gemaak implies that something <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> and <b>is</b> still in existence today, whereas was gemaak implies that something <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made,</b> but <b>was</b> destroyed or lost.|$|R

5|$|Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) (Latinized from Andries van Wezel), {{professor}} of anatomy at the University of Padua, {{is considered the}} founder of modern human anatomy. Originally from Brabant, Vesalius published the influential book De humani corporis fabrica ("the structure of the human body"), a large format book in seven volumes, in 1543. The accurate and intricately detailed illustrations, often in allegorical poses against Italianate landscapes, are thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> by the artist Jan van Calcar, a pupil of Titian.|$|E
5|$|A.× cunninghamii (Albany Woollybush), {{a hybrid}} between A.cuneatus and A.sericeus, was first {{collected}} in 1827, and published as A.cunninghamii in 1845. Other than some dubious collections in the 1830s and 1840s, no further sightings are known <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> until 1973, when Nelson rediscovered it. At {{the time it}} was regarded as a distinct species, but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid, and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in 2002. In appearance it is very similar to A.sericeus, but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical.|$|E

5|$|Morrell left Arsenal {{during the}} First World War and James McEwen served as {{caretaker}} manager, presiding over two matches. Both managers' work over 1914–15 resulted in Arsenal finishing in fifth place and aided the club's re-election to the First Division. When professional football resumed in 1919, Norris appointed Leslie Knighton as the club's manager. Arsenal remained under financial strain {{during this period}} and stagnated in the league; Kingston in his autobiography claimed he was under strict instruction to spend little on transfers. His working relationship with Norris moreover deteriorated and in 1925 he was dismissed. The decision to sack Knighton was said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> following Arsenal's defeat to West Ham United in the FA Cup, a competition which presented the club's only realistic chance of silverware.|$|E
5|$|One of the barrows (south {{of where}} the {{thatched}} barn now stands) contained a high status cremation of a woman of about twenty years in age, accompanied by an incense cup, a halberd-style pendant made from amber and copper alloy, and two gold cones that would have covered buttons of an organic material. The burial-goods recovered {{are similar to those}} of the Wessex culture, the Wilsford and Dorset Ridgeway series in particular. An urn from one of the barrows likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> between 1700 and 1500 B.C., has been identified as Trevisker ware, a type widely found throughout Devon and Cornwall which was transported east in lesser amounts, this find being one of the easternmost discovered.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{military}} equipment was mass-produced in state-run fabricae ("factories") which brought together advanced forging technology and skilled artisans. Roman weapons were mostly made of internally produced steel such as chalybs Noricus which {{was superior to}} unhardened iron. In contrast, forging technology, capacity and personnel were more limited in Germania libera, although {{there is evidence that}} production and standardization of equipment had greatly improved since the time of the Roman Principate. Steel-making was also known in Germania libera (spathae and rapier-like swords out of flexible steel were in use). But Alamanni production of sophisticated forge-products such as metal armour, helmets and swords was on a much smaller scale than the Romans'. Simple weapons such as axes and knives seem often <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> of unhardened iron.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes trace fossils {{have been}} {{referred}} to Megalosaurus or to the ichnogenus Megalosauripus. In 1997, a famous group of fossilised footprints (ichnites) {{was found in a}} limestone quarry at Ardley, twenty kilometres northeast of Oxford. They were thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> by Megalosaurus and possibly also some left by Cetiosaurus. There are replicas of some of these footprints, set across the lawn of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. One track was of a theropod accelerating from walking to running. According to Benson, such referrals are unprovable, as the tracks show no traits unique to Megalosaurus. Certainly they should be limited to finds that are of the same age as Megalosaurus bucklandii.|$|E
5|$|That the gun had a {{silencer}} on {{it during}} the murders was central to the prosecution's case. With the silencer, the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned the gun on herself. According to the prosecution, paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> during a fight for the gun. That the silencer {{was found in the}} gun cupboard was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason to return it to the cupboard before killing herself. But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—has blighted the prosecution's case, even though it was accepted by a majority of the jury.|$|E
5|$|The Garden Lobby of Althorp also {{contains}} a number of pieces of porcelain from reputable European manufacturers, but also several rare Oriental pieces. Of note in the Garden Lobby aside from its many plates is a Sèvres tobacco jar with double strap handles, believed to be painted by Louis Jean Thévenet in 1765, two Chelsea vases decorated with putti which metaphorically represent the four seasons, which the Red Earl had bought {{as a gift for}} his wife Charlotte, an extremely finely carved Meissen flower bowl with hundreds of tiny gilded blooms which dates to around 1745, a Meissen card box, and a blue and gold cherubic Meissen chocolate set-for-one which was believed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> for Marie Antoinette in 1781 as a present celebrating the birth of her son Dauphin.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of the railway meant that sufficient supplies and armaments had been transported to the plateau for the allies to resume their attack. The Second Bombardment started on April 9 and continued for ten days. Initially, little progress seemed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> because again the Russians were able {{to repair the damage}} caused, and the Russians continued to deliver supplies to Sevastopol from the north. However, they had sustained heavy casualties. Following a period of stalemate, Allied forces cut off one of the main Russian supply lines at Kerch on May 24.|$|E
5|$|The log {{discusses}} {{a telephone}} call made at 3:26am on 7 August to Chelmsford police station. According to the prosecution, this is the telephone call known <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> by Bamber, the same call that is entered in the event log. There was only one call that night {{to the police station}} about the shooting, the prosecution says, and it was made by Bamber at or just before 3:26am. Bamber's defence team argues otherwise. They say that the radio log is not a duplicate log of Bamber's call, but that it shows Nevill also telephoned the police that night.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1830s, Réunion was deforested for plantations. Former slaves joined white peasants in {{cultivating}} pristine areas after {{slavery was}} abolished in 1848, and the hoopoe starling was {{pushed to the}} edges of its former habitat. According to Hume, over-hunting was the final blow to the species; with forests more accessible, hunting by the rapidly growing human population may have driven the remaining birds to extinction. In 1821, a law mandating the extermination of grain-damaging birds was implemented, and the hoopoe starling had a reputation for damaging crops. During the 1860s, various writers noted that the bird had almost disappeared, but it was probably already extinct by this time; in 1877, Vinson lamented that the last individuals might have been killed by recent forest fires. No attempts to preserve the species in captivity seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made.</b> The hoopoe starling survived longer than many other extinct Mascarene species, and was the last of the Mascarene starling species to become extinct. The Rodrigues and Mauritius species probably disappeared with the arrival of rats; at least five species of Aplonis starlings have disappeared from the Pacific Islands, with rats contributing to their extinction. The hoopoe starling may have survived longer due to Réunion's rugged topography and highlands, where it spent much of the year.|$|E

5|$|In 1872 a major {{programme}} of building works was undertaken to a design by Edward Middleton Barry. This provided {{a roof over}} the central court of the Exchange and a new suite of offices {{on the first floor}} above the colonnades around the court. Other internal alterations appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> in the late 19th century, possibly also by Barry in 1872. This is uncertain as Barry's plans are yet to be found. Further extensive alterations were made in the 1900s when the City Valuer's Department moved to the Exchange in 1907. These included the provision of a lift from the basement and cellars to the first floor and major alterations to the cellars under {{the central part of the}} Exchange. Since 1945 further alterations have included the replacement of the roof over the central court by a temporary roof at a lower level, the removal of the clock tower at the back of the building and the internal rebuilding of all four floors of the coffeehouse together with the corresponding floors over the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|King Louis IX of France bought what he {{believed}} to be the authentic Crown of Thorns in Constantinople in 1239, and individual thorns were distributed as gifts by subsequent French kings. John, Duke of Berry (1340–1416), brother of King Charles V of France, had this reliquary made to house a single thorn; it was probably made a few years before he commissioned his famous Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, and some years after he commissioned the Royal Gold Cup, also in the British Museum. Previously dated between 1401 and 1410, from evidence in John Cherry's book of 2010 the reliquary is now thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> before 1397; based on the heraldic forms used, the museum now dates it to 1390–97. The Holy Thorn Reliquary was later thought to have been in the possession of Louis I, Duke of Orléans, but all recent writers prefer his brother, the Duke of Berry.|$|E
5|$|Teleology {{in biology}} {{is the use}} of the {{language}} of goal-directedness in accounts of evolutionary adaptation, which some biologists and philosophers of science find problematic. The term teleonomy has also been proposed. Teleology is the principle that some phenomena exist because they result in a goal being fulfilled. Before Darwin, organisms were seen as existing because God had designed and created them; their features such as eyes were taken by natural theology <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> to enable them to carry out their functions, such as seeing. Evolutionary biologists often use similar teleological formulations that invoke purpose, but these imply natural selection rather than actual goals, whether conscious or not. Dissenting biologists and religious thinkers held that evolution itself was somehow goal-directed (orthogenesis), and in vitalist versions, driven by a purposeful life force. Since such views are now discredited, with evolution working by natural selection acting on inherited variation, the use of teleology in biology has attracted criticism, and {{attempts have been made to}} teach students to avoid teleological language.|$|E
