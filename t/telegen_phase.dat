50|$|Affenpinschers {{often appear}} on lists of dogs that {{allegedly}} do not shed (moult). Every {{hair in the}} dog coat grows from a hair follicle, which has a three phase cycle, as do most mammals. These cycles are: anagen, growth of normal hair; catagen, growth slows, and hair shaft thins; telegen, hair growth stops, follicle rests, and old hair falls off—is shed. At {{the end of the}} <b>telegen</b> <b>phase,</b> the follicle begins the cycle again. The length of time of the growing and shedding cycle varies by breed, age, and by whether the dog is an inside or outside dog.|$|E
50|$|The Bolognese often {{appears on}} lists of dogs that {{allegedly}} do not shed (moult). It {{is true that}} these dogs do not seasonally moult or lose large amounts of fur as many other breeds do. However, they do eventually lose and replace individual hairs, similar to human hair growth cycles. Each hair grows from a hair follicle, which has a three phase cycle, as do most mammals. These cycles are: anagen, growth of normal hair; catagen growth slows, and hair shaft thins; telegen, hair growth stops, follicle rests, and old hair fall off—is shed. At {{the end of the}} <b>telegen</b> <b>phase,</b> the follicle begins the cycle again. The length of time of the growing and shedding cycle varies by age and other factors. There {{is no such thing as}} a completely non-shedding breed.|$|E
