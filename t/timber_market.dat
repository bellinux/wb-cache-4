2500|$|The <b>timber</b> <b>market</b> in Finland {{began to}} decline in 1929 due to the Great Depression, {{as well as the}} Soviet Union's {{entrance}} into the market. Financial and political problems culminated in the birth of the fascist Lapua Movement on November 23 in a demonstration in Lapua. The movement's stated aim was Finnish democracy and anti-communism. The Finnish legislature received heavy pressure to remove basic rights from Communist groups. Politics in Lithuania was heated, as President Voldemaras was unpopular in some quarters, and survived an assassination attempt in Kaunas. Later, while attending a meeting of the League of Nations, he was [...] ousted in a coup by President Smetona, who made himself dictator. Upon Voldemaras' removal from office, Geležinis Vilkas went underground and received aid and encouragement in its activities from Germany. Yugoslavia was renamed the [...] "Kingdom of Yugoslavia" [...] as King Alexander sought to unite the Balkans under his rule.

40|$|Forest {{ownership}} structure {{is known to}} have implications for forest management and the production of forest products and services. The {{ownership structure}}, as well as the degree of state regulation of forestry, could thus be expected to affect the functioning of <b>timber</b> <b>markets.</b> Hence, in the presence of strict prescriptions for forest management, the self-regulating mechanisms of timber markets—governed by the economic principle of supply and demand—could be inhibited. Using Finland and Lithuania as contrasting cases, we found empirical evidence for the existence of such a self-regulating mechanism in <b>timber</b> <b>markets</b> that are liberal in terms of state regulation of forest management, but not in those under strict state regulation. The results highlight how price increases (reductions) generally anticipate high (low) sales volumes or at least volume increases (reductions) in the Finnish case, suggesting that <b>timber</b> <b>markets</b> here self-regulate towards the equilibrium. Such patterns were not found in the Lithuanian case. The inability to respond to—and take advantage of—price signals could hamper the economic viability of forest ownership in <b>timber</b> <b>markets</b> constrained by regulation, and thus also impede efforts to mobilize wood to satisfy a foreseen increased demand.

40|$|Forest tenure {{reforms have}} granted smallholders and {{communities}} formal {{rights to land}} and forest resources. This article explores the various ways in which these local actors engage with <b>timber</b> <b>markets</b> {{in the context of}} such reforms. I argue that the economic benefits that communities can capture from the use of forest resources, mainly timber, are mediated by two sets of factors that are beyond the process of tenure reform. The first set of factors relate to communities′ capacity to interact with other actors-intermediaries and companies-in <b>timber</b> <b>markets,</b> and the second to specific conditions of market development. Interactions between community capacity and market conditions shape the ways in which smallholders and communities engage with <b>timber</b> <b>markets,</b> thereby influencing the benefits they can obtain from commercial use of their timber forests. This article focuses on forest communities that have acquired legal tenure rights in Latin America; specifically four communities located in tropical landscapes in Bolivia, Brazil, and Nicaragua. The types of engagement revealed by the analysis should be taken into account in differentiated public policies in order to improve the outcomes of forest tenure reforms...|$|R

A dynamic capital adjustment model for U. S. softwood stumpage markets is developed, and compared to a traditional lagged adjustment model. The results show that <b>timber</b> <b>markets</b> in the U. S. adjusted to the large supply shock of the late 1980 's over a 5 to 8 year period. Our short-run price elasticity estimates {{are similar to the}} existing literature, ranging from - 0. 002 to - 0. 253, although our estimates show that the demand is substantially more elastic in the long-run, with long-run elasticity estimates ranging from - 0. 134 to - 0. 506. If this adjustment in the demand function is taken into account when calculating welfare effects, the effects of the supply shock in <b>timber</b> <b>markets</b> of the late 1980 's on consumer surplus declines by over 50 % compared to the estimated effects when using the short-run model, and the total welfare effects decline by 37 %. dynamic adjustment, environmental regulation, price elasticity, regional <b>timber</b> <b>markets,</b> structural change, stumpage demand, timber supply...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} trend towards {{small-scale}} forest operators engaging in certification initiatives in response to growing demands for certified timber. We aimed to analyse whether certified smallholders gain better access to <b>timber</b> <b>markets</b> and better financial incentives. We used three smallholder forest enterprises from Gunungkidul and Kulon Progo districts, Java, Indonesia as case studies of different managerial operations. Two were farmer cooperatives {{and the other was}} an external trading company in partnership with village-level farmer groups. Different certification schemes and managerial approaches were analysed whether such factors influenced the ability of smallholders to access certified <b>timber</b> <b>markets</b> and obtain improved offers for their timber. We found that smallholders find it challenging to enter and participate in certified <b>timber</b> <b>markets</b> and to obtain the promised premium prices. The obvious costs of certification and uncertain benefits are major challenges for smallholders. Even when market opportunities are present, certification alone is insufficient to tap into these markets. Certified forest enterprises need dedicated managers with adequate entrepreneurial skills to establish networks and contacts with potential buyers, and to actively seek information on what is specified by certified timber processors...|$|R
