5|$|From 1514 to 1529, Thomas Wolsey (1473–1530), a {{cardinal}} {{of the established}} Church, oversaw {{domestic and foreign policy}} for the young king from his position as Lord Chancellor. Wolsey centralised the national government and extended the jurisdiction of the conciliar courts, particularly the Star Chamber. The Star Chamber's overall structure remained unchanged, but Wolsey used it to provide for much-needed reform of the criminal law. The power of <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>itself</b> did not outlive Wolsey, however, since no serious administrative reform was undertaken and its role was eventually devolved to the localities. Wolsey helped fill the gap left by Henry's declining participation in government (particularly in comparison to his father) but did so mostly by imposing himself in the King's place. His use of these courts to pursue personal grievances, and particularly to treat delinquents as if mere examples of a whole class worthy of punishment, angered the rich, who were annoyed as well by his enormous wealth and ostentatious living. Following Wolsey's downfall, Henry took full control of his government, although at court numerous complex factions continued to try to ruin and destroy each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Kenya and the National Assembly both attempted {{to stop the}} ICC process. The government appealed to both the United Nations Security Council and <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>itself</b> regarding the admissibility of the case. The National Assembly voted in favour of removing Kenya as a state party to the Rome Statute, the international treaty which established the ICC. Despite this opposition, the suspects cooperated with the proceedings and attended preliminary hearings in The Hague in April 2011 and confirmation of charges hearings in September of that year. The Pre-Trial Chamber II confirmed the charges against Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang and declined to confirm the charges against Ali, Kosgey, and Muthaura. The trial of Ruto and Sang began on 10 September 2013, while that of Kenyatta is supposed to begin on 5 February 2014. However the Chief prosecuter has asked that the case be adjourned citing lack of enough evidence required for trial.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} expression by the United States Supreme Court of {{adherence to}} this requirement {{came during the}} presidency of George Washington. Washington {{sent a letter to}} the Court asking for their approval should he choose to seek advice from them from time to time on matters that might not come before the Court in a timely manner. Chief Justice John Jay wrote in his response that, although the members of the Court had great confidence in the ability of the president to receive appropriate advice from his executive officers, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>itself</b> was constitutionally bound not to go beyond its role as an arbiter of judicial questions.|$|E
25|$|Later {{the logic}} of the {{decision}} was extended by an appeals court to cover claims made under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The Supreme Court itself later expressed doubt as to the legal soundness of that holding, and in the 1985 case Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon expressly held that it did not. This led lower courts to begin to overrule Wilko as well, and in 1989 <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>itself</b> did so in Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express Inc., part of a series of decisions in the 1980s and ever since that greatly expanded the use of arbitration in dispute resolution.|$|E

25|$|The {{curtailment}} of busing in Milliken v. Bradley is one {{of several}} reasons that have been cited to explain why equalized educational opportunity in the United States has fallen short of completion. In the view of various liberal scholars, the election of Richard Nixon in 1968 meant that the executive branch was no longer behind the Court's constitutional commitments. Also, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>itself</b> decided in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez (1973) that the Equal Protection Clause allows — but does not require — a state to provide equal educational funding to all students within the state. Moreover, the Court’s decision in Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925) allowed families to opt out of public schools, despite “inequality in economic resources that made the option of private schools available to some and not to others”, as Martha Minow has put it.|$|E
25|$|The Registry {{was split}} into several Departments; the Archives, the Accounting and Establishment, the Printing Service and the Copying Department. The Archives {{included}} a distribution {{service for the}} Court's documents and the legal texts used by <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>itself</b> and was described {{as one of the}} most difficult departments to organise. The Accounting and Establishment Department dealt with the requests for and allocation of the Court's yearly budget, which was drawn up by the Registrar, approved by the Court and submitted to the League of Nations. The Printing Department, run from a single printing plant in Leiden, was created to allow the circulation of the Court's publishings. The Copying Department comprised shorthand, typing and copying services, and included secretaries for the Registrar and judges, emergency reporters capable of taking notes down verbatim and copyists; the smallest of the departments, it comprised between 12 and 40 staff depending on the business of the Court.|$|E
25|$|In 1803, the Supreme Court {{established}} {{judicial review}} of federal legislation in Marbury v. Madison, holding, however, that Congress could not grant unconstitutional power to <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>itself.</b> The Constitution does not explicitly state that the courts may exercise judicial review; however, the notion that courts could declare laws unconstitutional was envisioned by the founding fathers. Alexander Hamilton, for example, mentioned and expounded upon the doctrine in Federalist No. 78. Originalists on the Supreme Court have argued that if the constitution does not say something explicitly it is unconstitutional to infer what it should, might or could have said. Judicial review means that the Supreme Court can nullify a congressional law. It is a huge check by the courts on the legislative authority and limits congressional power substantially. In 1857, for example, the Supreme Court struck down provisions of a congressional act of 1820 in its Dred Scott decision. At the same time, the Supreme Court can extend congressional power through its constitutional interpretations.|$|E
50|$|The District was {{established}} on March 10, 1824 with {{the division of}} the state into a Northern and Southern district. <b>The</b> circuit <b>court</b> <b>itself</b> {{was established}} on June 22, 1874.|$|R

25|$|Typhus {{was also}} common in prisons (and in crowded {{conditions}} where lice spread easily), {{where it was}} known as Gaol fever or Jail fever. Gaol fever often occurs when prisoners are frequently huddled together in dark, filthy rooms. Imprisonment until the next term of court was often equivalent to a death sentence. It was so infectious that prisoners brought before the court sometimes infected <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>itself.</b> Following the Assize held at Oxford in 1577, later deemed the Black Assize, over 300 died from epidemic typhus, including Sir Robert Bell, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. The outbreak that followed, between 1577 and 1579, killed about 10% of the English population. During the Lent Assize Court held at Taunton (1730) typhus caused {{the death of the}} Lord Chief Baron, as well as the High Sheriff, the sergeant, and hundreds of others. During a time when there were 241 capital offences, more prisoners died from 'gaol fever' than were put to death by all the public executioners in the realm. In 1759 an English authority estimated that each year a quarter of the prisoners had died from gaol fever. In London, typhus frequently broke out among the ill-kept prisoners of Newgate Gaol and then moved into the general city population.|$|E
25|$|Judge Advocate John Bingham {{presented}} the closing {{argument for the}} prosecution. The military tribunal had jurisdiction, he said, not only because <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>itself</b> had ruled {{at the beginning of}} the trials that it did but because they were crimes committed in a military zone, during a time of war, and against high government officials in carrying out treasonous activities. Bingham pointed out that the Surratt boarding house was where the conspiracy was planned, and Atzerodt, Booth, and Powell had all met with Surratt. Booth had paid for the rental of the carriage that took Surratt to Surrattsville each time, and Bingham said that was evidence that Surratt's trips were critical to the conspiracy. Bingham also said that Lloyd's testimony had been corroborated by others and that his unwillingness to reveal the cache of weapons in the tavern was prompted by his subservient tenant relationship to Surratt. Bingham concluded by reiterating the government's key point: Powell had returned to the Surratt house seeking Surratt, and that alone was proof of her guilt. Bingham also pointed out for the tribunal that the charge a person was indicted for was irrelevant. Under the law of conspiracy, if one person carries out a crime, all conspirators are guilty of the same crime.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the case}} also aroused {{controversy}} about <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>itself.</b> [...] David Marr described the four to three decision as indicating a new {{division in the}} composition of the court, the [...] "liberty divide", and noted that the result on the liberty question moved the court in the opposite direction to the contemporary trends of the Supreme Court of the United States and the House of Lords. Arthur Glass observed that the minority judges began their judgments from the position that indefinite non-judicial detention and the curtailment of personal freedom were troubling consequences, and noted that [...] "as is not uncommon in statutory construction, where you start from is critical to where you end up." [...] Marr accused the majority of deciding that [...] "saving Australia from boat people counts for more than Al-Kateb's raw liberty." ...|$|E

500|$|Sir Arthur Elton, 7th Baronet, {{inherited}} {{the house and}} title in 1853 and, like his father, was a writer. He resigned as MP for Bath in 1859 and {{spent the rest of}} his life improving the town, setting up a lending library and allotments, and building and funding the cottage hospital (still in existence). All Saints' Church, near the Court, was built in 1860 on the orders of Sir Arthur, and he also made additions to the fabric of <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>itself.</b> The West Wing of the house was largely destroyed by a fire in 1882. It was rebuilt, with C. E. Davis as the architect. During these building works, the chapel was rediscovered, the East window having been filled and altar broken off (perhaps during the English Protestant Reformation), and the room having been known until then as the [...] "Lady's Bower".|$|E
500|$|The Court {{held to the}} [...] "separate but equal" [...] {{doctrine}} {{for more}} than fifty years, despite numerous cases in which <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>itself</b> had found that the segregated facilities provided by the states were almost never equal, until Brown v. Board of Education (1954) reached the Court. In Brown the Court ruled that even if segregated black and white schools were of equal quality in facilities and teachers, segregation was inherently harmful to black students and so was unconstitutional. Brown met with a campaign of resistance from white Southerners, and for decades the federal courts attempted to enforce Browns mandate against repeated attempts at circumvention. This resulted in the controversial desegregation busing decrees handed down by federal courts {{in various parts of}} the nation. In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 (2007), the Court ruled that race could not be the determinative factor in determining to which public schools parents may transfer their children.|$|E
500|$|... "The Story of the Pig" [...] partly {{illustrates}} {{the notion that}} parental love subdues even physical repulsion, showing an elderly peasant couple cherishing their adopted porcine son, who, unbeknown to them, is enchanted. The creature instantly offsets his parents' sadness and immobility by his witty intelligence. Having applied his perseverance and spells to erect a magical bridge, the piglet fulfills the requirement for marrying the emperor's daughter, after which it is uncovered {{that he is a}} Făt-Frumos or Prince Charming character who assumes his real identity only by night. Although the plot is supposed to deal with imperial magnificence in fairy tale fashion, the setting is still primarily rural, and <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>itself</b> is made to look like an elevated peasant community. According to researcher Marcu Beza, the text is, outside of its humorous context, a distant reworking of ancient legends such as Cupid and Psyche. The story introduces three additional characters, old women who assess and reward the efforts of the virtuous: Holy Wednesday, Holy Friday and Holy Sunday. They represent a mix of Christian and pagan traditions, by being both personifications of the liturgical calendar and fairy-like patrons of the wilderness (zâne).|$|E
