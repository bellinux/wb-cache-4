60|$|On leaving Buitenzorg, I had coolies {{to carry}} my baggage and a horse for myself, both {{to be changed}} every six or seven miles. The road rose gradually, and after the first stage the hills closed in a little on each side, forming a broad valley; and the {{temperature}} was so cool and agreeable, and the country so interesting, that I preferred walking. Native villages imbedded in fruit trees, and pretty villas inhabited by planters or retired Dutch officials, gave this district a very pleasing and civilized aspect; but what most attracted my attention was the system of terrace-cultivation, which is here universally adopted, and which is, I should think, hardly equalled in the world. The slopes of the main valley, and of its branches, were everywhere cut in terraces up to a considerable height, and when they wound round the recesses of the hills produced all the effect of magnificent amphitheatres. Hundreds of square miles of country are thus terraced, and convey a striking idea of the industry {{of the people and}} the antiquity of their civilization. These terraces are extended year by year as the population increases, by the inhabitants of each village working in concert under the direction of their chiefs; and it is perhaps by this system of village culture alone, that such extensive terracing and irrigation has been rendered possible. It was probably introduced by the Brahmins from India, since in those Malay countries where there is no trace of a previous occupation by a civilized people, the <b>terrace</b> <b>system</b> is unknown. I first saw this mode of cultivation in Bali and Lombock, and, as I shall have to describe it in some detail there (see CHAPTER X.), I need say no more about it in this place, except that, owing to the finer outlines and greater luxuriance of the country in West Java, it produces there the most striking and picturesque effect. The lower slopes of the mountains in Java possess such a delightful climate and luxuriant soil; living is so cheap and life and property are so secure, that a considerable number of Europeans who have been engaged in Government service, settle permanently in the country instead of returning to Europe. They are scattered everywhere throughout the more accessible parts of the island, and tend greatly to the gradual improvement of the native population, and to the continued peace and prosperity of the whole country.|$|E

40|$|The Hani Rice <b>Terraces</b> <b>System,</b> {{based on}} gravity-flow irrigation, {{is one of}} the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) pilot sites {{selected}} by FAO in 2010. The water resource {{plays an important role in}} the sustainable development of this system. The value of water conserved by the forest is influenced by natural, economic and social factors. In this paper, the water quality, per capita water resources, per capita GDP and population density are chosen as indices to construct an index system for a comprehensive evaluation of water resources value. The weights of these indices are 0. 443, 0. 31, 0. 141 and 0. 106 respectively, which are determined by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. The water resources value has been assessed by the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model.

40|$|Located in {{the arid}} basalt desert of northeastern Jordan, the {{settlement}} of Jawa {{is by far the}} largest and best-preserved archaeological site in the region. The Early Bronze Age (EBA) settlement phase of Jawa (3500 – 3000 BCE) is characterized by a highly sophisticated water storage system made of a series of pools, dams, and canals. In addition, recent archaeological and geoarchaeological surveys have uncovered agricultural <b>terrace</b> <b>systems</b> in the nearby vicinity. In this study, four of these runoff <b>terrace</b> <b>systems</b> were investigated by detailed mapping. Additionally, thirteen sediment profiles from inside and outside the <b>terrace</b> <b>systems</b> were recorded and sampled. The examined samples were analyzed for bulk chemistry, texture, phytoliths, diatoms, and dung spherulites to supply information on the environmental and depositional conditions. The <b>terrace</b> <b>systems</b> were dated using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). Ancient terrace agriculture was practiced on slopes, small plateaus, and valleys close to Jawa through the use of surface canals, which collected and diverted floodwater from nearby wadis or runoff from adjacent slopes. The terraced fields were usually arranged in cascades and comprised a system of risers, canals, and spillways. The terrace fills investigated yield OSL ages of around 3300 BCE, indicating that the terraces were constructed in the Early Bronze Age. The terrace fill sequences are composed of mixed unstratified fine sediments of local origin, reflecting low-energy fluvial deposition regimes. The phytolith record is dominated by Pooid grasses that include the most common Near Eastern cereals, such as wheat and barley. Increased phytolith concentrations in terrace fill sediments, as compared to samples from non-terrace deposits nearby, suggest increased plant growth and water availability within the terraces. Whether the <b>terrace</b> <b>systems</b> were used for growing food crops only or whether they were additionally used for grazing cannot be ascertained. Overall, quantitative phytolith analyses in arid environments are well suited to investigate temporal and spatial distributions of plant microfossil concentrations and their relation to human activity or paleoenvironmental conditions...|$|R

40|$|Before the {{invention}} of modern, large-scale engineering projects, <b>terrace</b> <b>systems</b> were rarely built in single phases of construction, but instead developed gradually, and could even {{be said to have}} evolved. Understanding this process of landscape change is therefore important in order to fully appreciate how <b>terrace</b> <b>systems</b> were built and functioned, and is also pivotal to understanding how the communities that farmed these systems responded to changes; whether these are changes to the landscape brought about by the farming practices themselves, or changes to social, economic or climatic conditions. Combining archaeological stratigraphy, soil micromorphology and geochemistry, this paper presents a case-study from the historic and extensive terraced landscape at Konso, southwest Ethiopia, and demonstrates e in one important river valley at least e that the original topsoil and much of the subsoil was lost prior to the construction of hillside terraces. Moreover, the study shows that alluvial sediment traps that were built adjacent to rivers relied on widespread hillside soil erosion for their construction, and strongly suggests that these irrigated riverside fields were formerly a higher economic priority than the hillside terraces themselves; a possibility that was not recognised by numerous observational studies of farming in this landscape. Research that takes into account how <b>terrace</b> <b>systems</b> change through time can thus provide important details of whether the function of the system has changed, and can help assess how the legacies of former practices impact current or future cultivation...|$|R

Few studies focused on fluvial to tidal environment transition during Pleistocene. An understanding of both continental and marine processes at the lower Seine Valley scale is needed to comprehend the stepped <b>terraces</b> <b>system.</b> On the one hand, the Seine River has incised a 125 m-deep and 2 - 4 km-wide valley.

The braided Pleistocene Seine River flow was able to erode, transport and rework bed material over large distances. On the other hand, alternating glacial and interglacial conditions during the Pleistocene period resulted in large shoreline fluctuations between the coastal watersheds of the Bay of Seine (Seine, Touques, Dives and Orne) and the Channel. During the interglacial periods (i. e., Marine Isotopic Stages 5 e, 7 or 11), several marine incursions occurred along different courses of the Seine fluvial system.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, we {{consider}} how surface uplift {{of a narrow}} mountain range has interacted with glacial-related sea-level cyclicity and climatic change to produce a series of marine and non-marine terrace systems. The terrace deposits of the Kyrenia Range record rapid surface uplift of a long-lived tectonic lineament during the early Pleistocene, followed by continued surface uplift at a reduced rate during mid-late Pleistocene. Six terrace depositional systems are distinguished and correlated along {{the northern and southern}} flanks of the range, termed K 0 to K 5. The oldest and highest (K 0 <b>terrace</b> <b>system)</b> is present only within {{the central part of the}} range. The K 2 –K 5 terrace systems formed later, at sequentially lower levels away from the range. The earliest stage of surface uplift (K 0 <b>terrace</b> <b>system)</b> comprises lacustrine carbonates interbedded with mass-flow facies (early Pleistocene?). The subsequent <b>terrace</b> <b>system</b> (K 1) is made up of colluvial conglomerate and aeolian dune facies on both flanks of the range. The later terrace systems (K 2 to K 5) each begin with a basal marine deposit, interpreted as a marine transgression. Deltaic conglomerates prograded during inferred global interglacial stages. Overlying aeolian dune facies represent marine regressions, probably related to global glacial stages. Each terrace depositional system was uplifted and preserved, followed by subsequent deposits at progressively lower topographic levels. Climatic variation during interglacial–glacial cycles and autocyclic processes also exerted an influence on deposition, particularly on short-period fluvial and aeolian deposition...|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the younger {{of a series of}} Quaternary {{terraces}} along the flanks of the Kyrenia Range in northern Cyprus, specifically the Kyrenia (Girne) and the Koupia terraces. The Kyrenia (Girne) terrace is tentatively correlated with oxygen isotope stage 5 (125  Ka), and the Koupia terrace with oxygen isotope stage 3 (&# 60; 50  Ka). Along the northern flank of the range, the Kyrenia (Girne) terrace deposits (5 – 20  m above modern sea level) typically begin with a basal lag conglomerate and then pass upwards into shallow-marine calcarenites and then into variable aeolianites, paleosols and fluvial deposits (up to 20  m thick). In contrast, the Koupia terrace (&# 60; 2  m above modern sea level) consists of aeolianites and shallow-marine calcarenites (up to 8  m thick). The equivalent deposits along the southern flank of the range are entirely non-marine fluvial mud, sands and conglomerates. The marine to continental <b>terrace</b> <b>systems</b> can be tentatively correlated based on mapping, height above modern sea level and sedimentary facies. However, variable preservation and patchy exposure require such correlations to be independently tested. To achieve this, a portable optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) reader was used to determine the luminescence characteristics of the two <b>terrace</b> <b>systems.</b> Luminescence profiles show major differences in luminescence characteristics between the two <b>terrace</b> depositional <b>systems,</b> which can be related to sedimentary processes, provenance and age. These features allow sections in different areas to be effectively correlated. Individual sections show luminescence properties that are generally consistent with an expected up-sequence decrease in age. However, the younger Koupia terrace deposits show higher luminescence intensities compared with the older Kyrenia (Girne) terrace deposits. This can be explained by multiple phases of reworking of the Kyrenia (Girne) terrace deposits, which changed the luminescence characteristics of the sediment. The use of the portable OSL reader is therefore an effective means of correlating Late Quaternary terrace deposits in northern Cyprus and probably also elsewhere...|$|R
