5|$|As Galván left a Farmacia Guadalajara {{drugstore}} {{near his}} home in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, on the evening of 27 February 2014, he was kidnapped along with businessman Miguel Ángel Ortiz. His vehicle was discovered abandoned with open doors in the pharmacy's parking lot by his wife. The following day, a disfigured corpse found in the trunk of a pickup truck in the town of García, Nuevo León, was taken to the hospital of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León. After more than a month of forensic examination, experts officially identified the corpse as that of Galván on 31 March 2014. Post-mortem reports concluded that Galván had been tortured before being killed with a coup de grâce. The exact location of Galván's murder remains unknown, although authorities <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> he was most likely killed in Tamaulipas.|$|E

25|$|Brand-conscious: Brand-consciousness is characterised by a {{tendency}} to buy expensive, well-known brands or designer labels. Those who score high on brand-consciousness <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the higher prices are an indicator of quality and exhibit a preference for department stores or top-tier retail outlets.|$|E

25|$|Evolutionary {{biologists}} {{are skeptical}} of the claim that syntactic knowledge is transmitted in the human genome. However, many researchers claim {{that the ability to}} acquire such a complicated system is unique to the human species. Non-biologists also <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that our ability to learn spoken language may have been developed through the evolutionary process and that the foundation for language may be passed down genetically. The ability to speak and understand human language requires speech production skills and abilities as well as multisensory integration of sensory processing abilities.|$|E
25|$|Many Orthodox Jews {{view the}} Written and Oral Torah {{as the same}} as Moses taught, for all {{practical}} purposes. Conservative Jews <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> {{that much of the}} Oral law is divinely inspired, while Reform and Reconstructionist Jews tend to view all of the Oral law as an entirely human creation. Traditionally, the Reform movement held that Jews were obliged to obey the ethical but not the ritual commandments of Scripture, although today many Reform Jews have adopted many traditional ritual practices. Karaite Jews traditionally consider the Written Torah to be authoritative, viewing the Oral Law as only one possible interpretation of the Written Torah.|$|E
25|$|Another {{aspect of}} microsociology aims {{to focus on}} {{individual}} behavior in social settings. One specific researcher in the field, Erving Goffman, claims that humans <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that they are actors on a stage. He explains his theories in his book The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. He argues that as a result, individuals will further proceed with their actions based on the response of that individual's 'audience' or in other words, the people to whom he is speaking. Much like a play, Goffman believes that rules of conversing and communication exist: to display confidence, display sincerity, and avoid infractions which are otherwise known as embarrassing situations. Breaches of such rules are what make social situations awkward.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Subway Vigilante," [...] as Goetz {{was labeled}} by New York City media, was front-page news for months, partly {{owing to the}} {{repressed}} passions the incident unleashed in New York and other cities. Public opinion <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> {{fall into one of}} three camps: Those in the first camp <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> Goetz's version of the incident, that he was aggressively accosted and surrounded by the four men and feared he was about to be beaten and robbed. Those in the second camp <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> the version told by the four men, that they were merely panhandling to get some money to play video games. A third camp believed that Goetz had indeed been threatened, but viewed the shooting as an unjustified overreaction.|$|R

25|$|Much {{recent work}} has been done to {{identify}} the underlying causes of conversion and related disorders and to better understand why conversion and hysteria appear more commonly in women. Current theoreticians <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that there is no single cause for these disorders. Instead, the emphasis tends to be on the individual understanding of the patient and a variety of therapeutic techniques. In some cases, the onset of conversion disorder correlates to a traumatic or stressful event. There are also certain populations that are considered at risk for conversion disorder, including people suffering from a medical illness or condition, people with personality disorder, and individuals with dissociative identity disorder. However, no biomarkers have yet been found to support the idea that conversion disorder is caused by a psychiatric condition.|$|E
25|$|Elderspeak is a {{specialized}} speech style used by younger adults when addressing older adults. The speaker makes accommodations that include producing shorter, less complex sentences, using simpler vocabulary, filler words, fragmented sentences, lexical filters, and repetition. Elderspeak also includes using {{terms that are}} overly endearing, asking closed questions that prompt an answer, and using the collective “we”. Young people tend to speak at a slower rate and include more pauses when communicating with elders. This speech style is often patronizing in nature and resembles baby talk. Elderspeak stems from a reliance on stereotypes about cognitive abilities of older persons, and its use may {{be a result of}} or contribute to ageism, a form of discrimination based on age differences. Young people <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that aging is associated with cognitive declines, including declines in language processing and production. However, this speech pattern is primarily based on stereotypes, as evidenced by its use in situations where older adults are clearly functioning well. When conversing with older persons, younger people often accommodate their speech based on their personal evaluation of their conversation partner’s ability, rather than their actual ability. Working to overcome elderspeak through awareness and self-monitoring as well as through formal educational programs are strategies individuals and other care providers can use to promote successful aging for older clients. Therefore, although some aspects of elderspeak may be beneficial for some recipients, it is generally seen as inappropriate and can hinder intergenerational communication.|$|E
500|$|There is {{disagreement}} among scholars as {{to whether}} the knife used in this fight was the same as what is now known as a Bowie knife, also called an Arkansas Toothpick. Multiple accounts exist of who designed and built the first Bowie knife. Some claim that Bowie designed it, while others attribute the design to noted knife makers of the time. In a letter to The Planter's Advocate, Rezin Bowie claimed to have invented the knife, however, and many Bowie family members as well as [...] "most authorities on the Bowie knife <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it was invented by" [...] Rezin. Rezin Bowie's grandchildren, however, claimed that Rezin merely supervised his blacksmith, who was the creator of the knife.|$|E
50|$|The synonym P. verna as {{described}} by Linnaeus is usually assigned to this plant in recent times. In much of the 20th century botanists <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it referred <b>to</b> P. aurea. Yet earlier authors commonly misapplied P. verna to spring cinquefoil (P. neumanniana).|$|R

40|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{the elderly are}} sexual beings. Each person is created to be a sexual being with normal desires of wanting to be loved and touched.

500|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} by Universal Pictures {{near the end of}} their horror film period. According to legend, as the result of its pending merger with International Pictures, Universal Pictures adopted a policy against releasing any more B movies, so sold The Brute Man [...] for $125,000 to poverty row's Producers Releasing Corporation, which distributed the film without any mention of Universal's involvement in publicity or credits. [...] In fact, Universal released at least one B-western following the merger, and still had numerous other titles in active circulation from the preceding few years, {{at the time of the}} merger. [...] Most experts <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Universal simply found the exploitation of the deceased Hatton and his deformity for the third time, in his last film (in which evidence of his impending demise may be foreshadowed in his acting), and of a poorly-developed story, to be detrimental to its corporate image but did not want to take a financial loss by simply shelving the film permanently.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{the double}} burden is more evolved with the times {{concerning}} both sexes and their newfound roles. The role of a provider and caregiver is sometimes expected of women, but as more women enter the workforce, an 'independent' ideology seems to take effect and forces some women to decide between a career and family. Some may choose strictly one or the other, others may choose to carry the burden of both lifestyles. Some [...] "modern men <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in the principle of equal sharing of domestic labor, but fail to actually {{live up to that}} belief." [...] The constant tug of war regarding one's time and where it could, should but will be spent creates a new speed bump that is a little bit higher than the previous ones. Modern times illuminate the dilemma that many dual-income couples face when trying to reconcile unpaid domestic work and paid employment. The burden of encompassing both ideologies plays a toll on both sexes in today's societies.|$|E
500|$|Strang's disciples {{today are}} divided into two main factions; one is led by a Presiding High Priest, who does not claim to have the {{authority}} or priesthood office possessed by Joseph Smith or James Strang. [...] The other claims that the first faction is in error, and that by incorporating in 1961, it lost its identity as a faithful continuation of Strang's organization. [...] This second group claims {{that it is the}} sole true remnant of James Strang's church. [...] Missionary work is no longer emphasized among the Strangites (unlike the LDS and many other Latter Day Saint sects), as they <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that after three murdered prophets (Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith and James Strang) God closed His dispensation to the [...] "gentiles" [...] of the West. Consequently, Strang's church has continued to dwindle until the present day. [...] Current membership figures vary between 50 and 300 persons, depending upon the source consulted.|$|E

[...] (notebook from their Golden Harvest CD) Still these beliefs caused them the most violence as it encouraged them to harbor fugitive slaves or American Indians.|$|R
50|$|It {{can be hard}} to draw a {{fine line}} between Amillenialism and Revivalist Postmillenialism, as they agree on much and are both {{reluctant}} to make concrete predictions about the future based on Scriptural prophecy. Broadly, though, Amillenialism <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> society will, through growing rebellion, continue to deteriorate, while Postmillenialism believes the influence of the Church on the world will increase, producing greater righteousness.|$|R
500|$|Manchester City's officially {{recognised}} supporters club is the Manchester City FC Supporters Club (1949), {{formed from}} a merger of two existing organisations in 2010: the Official Supporters Club (OSC) and the Centenary Supporters Association (CSA). There {{have been several}} fanzines published by supporters; the longest running is King of the Kippax {{and it is the}} only one still published. The City fans' song of choice is a rendition of [...] "Blue Moon", which despite its melancholic theme is belted out with gusto {{as though it were a}} heroic anthem. City supporters <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team, and label unexpected results [...] "typical City". Events that fans regard as [...] "typical City" [...] include City's being the only reigning English champions ever to be relegated (in 1938), the only team to score and concede over 100 goals in the same season (1957–58), or the more recent example that City were the only team to beat Chelsea in the 2004–05 Premier League, yet in the same season City were knocked out of the FA Cup by Oldham Athletic, a team two divisions lower.|$|E

Parmentier believed that no actual human sacrifice would have taken place, but argued that the claim of such was genuine to the original text, in an instance of 4th-century Christian propaganda depicting pagan customs as abhorrent.|$|R
40|$|Arguments on {{determinism}} and fate must {{be placed}} in human being's industry to over come life uncertainties.

50|$|Often {{viewed in}} the Italy of the time as a god-like figure, Mazzini was {{nonetheless}} denounced by many of his compatriots as a traitor.

The antifascist Mazzini Society, founded in the United States in 1939 by Italian political refugees, took his name; they, like him, served Italy from exile.|$|R
50|$|Until , many anthropologists {{had doubts}} that the canoe-legends {{described}} a deliberate migration, <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the migration occurred accidentally when seafarers became lost and drifted to uninhabited shores.

50|$|The {{answers to}} the {{questions}} are often different: the public often blames technology, outsourcing, high corporate profits, and downsizing as reasons for why growth is lower than it could be. Economists, on the other hand, barely pay any heed to such arguments. Some 74% of the public blame greedy oil companies for high gas prices, but only 11% of economists do. The public <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> real incomes are decreasing while economists take the opposite stance.|$|R
