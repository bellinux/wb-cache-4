5|$|A {{study of}} central bank {{interventions}} on the US dollar and Deutsche mark found only limited {{evidence of any}} substantial effect on deviations from UIRP. UIRP has been found <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>over</b> very small spans of time (covering only a number of hours) with a high frequency of bilateral exchange rate data. Tests of UIRP for economies experiencing institutional regime changes, using monthly exchange rate data for the US dollar versus the Deutsche mark and the Spanish peseta versus the British pound, have found some evidence that UIRP held when US and German regime changes were volatile, and held between Spain and the United Kingdom particularly after Spain joined the European Union in 1986 and began liberalizing capital mobility.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the 13th century Henry III began to {{redesign}} his favourite castles, including Winchester and Windsor, building larger halls, grander chapels, installing glass windows and decorating the palaces with painted walls and furniture. This marked the beginning of a trend towards the development of grand castles designed for elaborate, elite living. Life in earlier keeps had been focused around a single great hall, with privacy for the owner's family provided by using an upper floor for their own living accommodation. By the 14th century nobles were travelling less, bringing much larger households with them when they did travel and entertaining visitors with equally large retinues. Castles such as Goodrich were redesigned in the 1320s to provide greater residential privacy and comfort for the ruling family, while retaining strong defensive features and a capacity <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>over</b> 130 residents at the castle. The design influenced subsequent conversions at Berkeley and by the time that Bolton Castle was being built, in the 1380s, it was designed to hold up to eight different noble households, each with their own facilities. Royal castles such as Beaumaris, although designed with defence in mind, were designed to hold up to eleven different households at any one time.|$|E

In November 1958, a major expansion of Tiananmen Square started, which was completed after only 11 months, in August 1959. This followed the vision of Mao Zedong to make the square {{the largest and most}} spectacular in the world, and intended <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>over</b> 500,000 people. In that process, a large number of residential buildings and other structures have been demolished. On its southern edge, the Monument to the People's Heroes has been erected. Concomitantly, as part of the Ten Great Buildings constructed between 1958–59 to commemorate the ten-year anniversary of the People's Republic of China, the Great Hall of the People and the Revolutionary History Museum (now the National Museum of China) were erected on the western and eastern sides of the square.|$|E

500|$|The {{peace was}} broken on 11 November 1915 by {{an attack on}} a supply convoy headed for Khénifra by 1,200–1,500 Zaians and allied tribesmen. [...] The Moroccans pressed to within [...] of the French, and Garnier-Duplessix, in command of the convoy, was forced to resort to the bayonet to push them back. [...] French {{casualties}} amounted to just 3 killed and 22 wounded but Henrys was concerned by the influence that Hammou continued <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>over</b> other Berber tribes. [...] In retaliation Henrys took both groupes mobiles across the Rbia and bombarded the Zaian camp, inflicting casualties but making little impression on their will to fight. [...] The Zaians recrossed the Rbia in January 1916, camping in French territory and raiding the submitted tribes. [...] Feeling that his communications with Taza were threatened Henrys withdrew his groupes to the Khénifra area, both of them coming under attack en route. [...] At M'Rirt a sizeable Zaian attack was repulsed with 200 casualties but the French suffered the loss of one officer and 24 men killed and 56 wounded.|$|E
500|$|By 1923, {{the teams}} no longer shared the Polo Grounds, as Giants owner Charles Stoneham had {{attempted}} to evict the Yankees in 1920. Although the attempt was unsuccessful, and Stoneham and the Yankees' owners agreed to a two-year lease renewal, the Giants indicated that the Yankees would not receive an extension after 1922. The treatment pushed the Yankees into seeking their own stadium. In 1921, the team bought a plot {{of land in the}} Bronx, and the construction crew finished the new ballpark before the 1923 season. Yankee Stadium, a triple-deck facility, was originally designed to hold more than 55,000 spectators; it was later able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>over</b> 70,000. Writer Peter Carino called the stadium [...] "a larger and more impressive facility than anything yet built to house a baseball team." [...] At Yankee Stadium's inaugural game on April 18, 1923, Ruth hit the first home run in the stadium, which sportswriter Fred Lieb named [...] "the House That Ruth Built" [...] as the Yankees would not have needed such a large stadium without the Ruth-driven attendance. Ruth himself had a resurgence after receiving vocal criticism for his 1922 World Series performance. He shared the MLB lead with Cy Williams by hitting 41 home runs in the 1923 season, and had a career-best [...]393 batting average; his performance earned him the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award. The Yankees finished first for the third consecutive year, and faced the Giants again in the 1923 World Series. Giants outfielder Casey Stengel hit game-winning home runs in two of the first three games of the World Series, but Ruth's three home runs helped the Yankees win in six games for their first MLB title. Off the field, Ruppert purchased Huston's share of the Yankees for $1,250,000, assuming full ownership of the club.|$|E

It is estimated that the Greeks shipped nearly 10 million liters of wine into Gaul each year through Massalia. In 1929, the discovery of the Vix Grave in Burgundy included several artifacts demonstrating the strong ties between Greek wine traders and local Celtic villagers.

60|$|For the self-same reason, Mr. Montague Nevitt didn't {{hint that}} evening to Guy {{that he had}} become possessed {{during the course of}} the day of a secret of the first {{importance}} to Guy's fortune and future. Of course, a man so astute as Montague Nevitt jumped at once at the correct conclusion, that Colonel Kelmscott must be the two Warings' father. But he wasn't going to be fool enough to chuck his chance away by sharing that information with any second person. A secret is far too valuable a lever in life to be carelessly flung aside by a man of ambition. And Montague Nevitt saw this secret in particular was doubly valuable to him. He could use it, wedge-wise, with both the Warings in all his future dealings, by promising to reveal to one or other of them a matter of importance and probable money-value, and he could use it also as a perpetual threat <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>over</b> Colonel Kelmscott, if ever it should be needful to extort blackmail from the possessor of Tilgate, or to thwart his schemes by some active interference.|$|E

Going to the south-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe Wood, I observed far off, {{in the direction of}} nineteenth-century Banstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any I had hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins I knew, and the facade had an Oriental look: the face of it having the lustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind of bluish-green, of a certain type of Chinese porcelain. This difference in aspect suggested a difference in use, and I was minded to push on and explore. But the day was growing late, and I had come upon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit; so I resolved <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>over</b> the adventure for the following day, and I returned to the welcome and the caresses of little Weena.

I resolved I would make the descent without further waste of time, and started out in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite and aluminium.|$|E
