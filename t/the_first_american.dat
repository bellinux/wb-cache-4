5|$|After the Portland Rosebuds, an American-based team, {{joined the}} PCHA in 1914, the {{trustees}} {{issued a statement}} that the Cup was no longer for {{the best team in}} Canada, but now for {{the best team in the}} world.

Two years later, the Rosebuds became <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>American</b> team to play in the Stanley Cup Final. In 1917, the Seattle Metropolitans became <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>American</b> team to win the Cup. After that season, the NHA dissolved, and the National Hockey League (NHL) took its place.|$|E
