40|$|In {{his article}} {{reporting}} {{the results of}} a new prototype phacoemulsification tip with internal grooves (<b>threaded</b> <b>tip),</b> Watanabe 1 showed that the <b>threaded</b> <b>tip</b> can amplify the cavitation effect and that intensification of cavitation gives a higher phacoemulsification effect. We have also investigated the role of the phaco tip when ultrasound (US) energy with an ultra-speed video recording system is applied by analyzing the stroke motion and the surface constitution before and after surgery. Based on our data and the frames of the videos, we assume that the shape of the phaco tip correlates to sections where the deterioration effect of cavitation is seen. This suggests that generation of the turbulence waves also depends on the tip design. In 2005, we described a technique for visualizing fluid turbulence and cavitation created by a US phaco tip and suggested that cavitation was involved in fragmentation of the nucleus. 2 The study by Zacharias 3 indicates that there is no relationship between cavitation and phacoemulsification power; moreover, he found that cavitation does not improve cutting function. Watanabe often references Zacharias’ work, often to support his own work, but attempts to contradict it if we consider the conclusion expressed above. Another consideration to evaluate is related to the fact that grooves create more cavitation. This is not a positive and safe result if the tissue damage effect and the dispersion of metal fragments in the anterior chamber are considered. Clinical studies show that cavitation {{may play a role in}} decreasing endothelial cells. 2 and 4 The application of high-intensity US energy in the aqueous media can generate acoustic cavitation with the concomitant generation of free radicals and sonoluminescence, a phenomenon in which electronically excited species cause the emission of a light flash. It can also cause localized high pressure and temperature elevation. 2 All these factors can cause tissue damage. Nevertheless, we strongly believe that the grooves, as designed by Watanabe, provide traction and mechanical adherence that could give the user a feeling of less chatter and can improve gripping capacity. In conclusion, we consider Watanabe’s study interesting and innovative and think that future studies should consider the potential role of the change of the tip surface to increase the gripping adherence and to reduce the chattering effect of the phaco tip...|$|E
40|$|Intramedullary tibiotalocalcaneal {{arthrodesis}} (IMTCA) is {{an increasingly}} used procedure for salvage of complex hindfoot and ankle disorders. 1 • 2 To avoid injury to vital plantar neurovascular structures, {{it is important}} to begin with an appropriate insertion site during retrograde IMTCA. We use a simple, reproducible method to deter-mine this site based on anatomic landmarks. TECHNIQUE In the sagittal plane, a line is drawn from the second toe {{to the center of the}} heel (Fig. 1). In the coronal plane, a line is drawn at the junction of the anterior and middle thirds of the heel pad (Fig. 1). A line drawn in the coronal plane bisecting the medial malleolus may also be used (Fig. 2). If the medial malleolus is used as a reference, the line obviously must be drawn before resection of the malleoli. At the intersection of the sagittal and coronal lines, a 3 -cm transverse incision is made in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. A hemostat is used to bluntly dissect down to the plantar cortex of the calcaneus. A 3. 2 -mm <b>threaded</b> <b>tip</b> guide pin is then placed onto the plantar cortex of the calcaneal body. If the guide pin slides medially toward the sustentaculum, reposition it a few more millimeters laterally.

They also {{construct}} a bolas made of a single <b>thread,</b> <b>tipped</b> with a large ball of very wet sticky silk. They emit chemicals that resemble the pheromones of moths, and then swing the bolas at the moths. Although they miss on about 50% of strikes, they catch about the same weight of insects per night as web-weaving spiders of similar size. The spiders eat the bolas if they have not made a kill in about 30 minutes, rest for a while, and then make new bolas. Juveniles and adult males are much smaller and do not make bolas. Instead they release different pheromones that attract moth flies, and catch them with their front pairs of legs.|$|R

30|$|Pin {{geometry}} and thread design are parameters {{that has been}} studied {{in the context of}} reducing pin site infection. W-Dahl and Toksvig-Larsen [54] randomized patients undergoing hemicallotasis osteotomy to have either XCaliber (Orthofix) pins with optimized <b>thread</b> and <b>tip</b> design or standard Orthofix pins. In both groups, HA-coated pins were used in the metaphyseal bone, whereas non-coated pins were used in diaphyseal bone. At 7  weeks post-operatively, there were no differences in use of antibiotics (10.5  days with XCaliber, 7.5  days with standard; p =  0.16), although the XCaliber group had significantly more pain at rest, pain during activity and greater paracetamol use. The authors concluded that the thread design of the standard pin was adequate in this clinical setting.|$|R

30|$|The {{equivalent}} stress {{values of the}} contact model were higher at the implant neck than the tip, and the stress generation range was also broader. However, in the fixation model, the implant neck and tip had substantially equivalent values and the stress generation range was also narrower {{than that of the}} contact model. This shows that under immediate loading conditions, there is a high likelihood that loading applied to the superstructure is also supported by cancellous bone at the implant <b>threads</b> and <b>tip,</b> but the majority is supported by cortical bone at the implant neck. That is, under immediate loading conditions, it is believed {{there is a need to}} be mindful of the stress concentration at the implant neck. The material properties of the FEA models constructed in the present study cannot not be compared to actual oral cavity stress values because they differ significantly from an actual bone. However, when regarding how peri-implant bone is impacted by contact between the implant and bone, it is considered sufficiently useful in predicting tendencies.|$|R

30|$|For many {{researchers}} in wood and forest sciences, increment borer is a preferred way of sampling {{because it can}} take wood core samples without killing the living tree. Manual increment borers have a tapered cutting <b>thread</b> at the <b>tip,</b> which draws the borer into the stem when rotated. They are {{the most commonly used}} tool to obtain core samples, typically from 4.35 to 12  mm in diameter [1]. The bit for sampling 12  mm cores has the outer diameter of 19  mm. Owing to high contact surface area and large friction forces with the wood, the increment borer needs a high torque to penetrate the wood, especially when sampling 12  mm cores.|$|R
40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Tibial {{osteotomy}} by the hemicallotasis technique (HCO) requires strong pin fixation. We compared pin fixation in HCO {{using a new}} self-drilling XCaliber pin (Orthofix) with optimized <b>thread</b> and <b>tip</b> design, with the commonly used standard pin (Orthofix). Patients and methods 50 patients, mean age 51 (35 - 66) years, to be treated by HCO were randomized to standard pins or XCaliber pins. In the metaphyseal bone, hydroxyapatite-coated (HA-coated) pins were used in both types of pins. In the diaphyseal bone, non-coated pins were used. The torque forces for insertion and extraction (in Nm) were measured. Results The insertion torque was higher for both the proximal and distal standard pins (2. 1 Nm (SD 0. 9) and 7. 0 Nm (1. 3), respectively) than for the XCaliber pins (1. 3 Nm (0. 8) and 3. 6 Nm (1. 4)). The extraction torque force was higher for the proximal standard pins (4. 3 Nm (3. 1)) than for the proximal XCaliber pins (1. 5 Nm (1. 7)) (p < 0. 001). The extraction torque for the distal standard pins was 1. 9 Nm (2. 0) and for the distal XCaliber pins it was 1. 4 Nm (1. 1).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pin-site {{infection}} and pin loosening are complications {{that can cause}} discomfort to the patients. The purpose of {{present study was to}} evaluate pin-site infection, pain, and the use of medications using the XCaliber pin (Orthofix) with optimized <b>thread</b> and <b>tip</b> design, and the commonly used standard pin (Orthofix) during the procedure of hemicallotasis osteotomy (HCO). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty patients of mean age 51 (35 - 66) years treated with HCO were randomized to standard pins (Orthofix) or XCaliber pins (Orthofix). Hydroxyapatite-coated pins were used in the metaphyseal bone and non-coated pins in the diaphyseal bone in both groups. Pin sites, pain, and the use of medications were evaluated weekly during the HCO. RESULTS: At week 7 the patients in the XCaliber group had more pain at rest [19 (22) vs. 5 (5) mm, P = 0. 01] and during activity [32 (32) vs. 12 (13) mm, P = 0. 02] and used more paracetamol (2, 100 vs. 925 mg, P = 0. 04) than those in the standard group, with similar differences, until the extraction of the pins. There was no difference in the use of antibiotics [10. 5 (14. 5) days (XCaliber) vs. 7 (7. 5) days (standard) (P = 0. 16) ]. CONCLUSION: The commonly used standard pin has important clinical- and patient-related benefits...|$|R
30|$|Mechanical lead {{extraction}} {{systems are}} very useful tools developed for lead extraction procedures. They consist of specially designed locking stylets which fix {{the lead and}} a hand-powered flexible dilator plastic sheath. The sheath has <b>threaded</b> metal distal <b>tip</b> which cuts fibrous adhesions when rotated by a handle. Unlike powered sheaths like laser or electrosurgical dissection sheaths, no energy form is used for extraction. The distal steel blade of the sheath can be more effective on calcified areas on which powered sheaths are less effective (Smith and Love 2008). After the lead is fixed by locking stylet; the sheath is advanced over the lead-stylet complex to cut fibrotic adhesions and liberate the lead from vascular system. Evolution® mechanical dilator sheath which we use in our clinic for extraction procedures also has a telescopic outer polymer sheath which protects venous wall from the metal cutting tip. Leads are extracted by gentle traction, countertraction and by cutting through adhesions with this system. Mechanical extraction systems are less costly than laser systems and successful results are being reported with these systems recently (Starck et al. 2013; Mazzone et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{transport}} properties {{of a system}} of three Luttinger liquid wires (with different interaction strengths g, g_ 3), connected through a Y-junction (main wire and tunneling <b>tip)</b> <b>threaded</b> by magnetic flux, within the scattering state formalism. The scattering matrix and the matrix of conductances are parametrized by three variables. For these we derive coupled RG equations, up to second order in the interaction. The fixed point structure of these equations is analyzed in detail. For repulsive interaction (g, g_ 3 > 0) there is only one stable fixed point, corresponding to the complete separation of the wires. For attractive interaction (g< 0 and/or g_ 3 < 0) four fixed points are found, whose stability depends on the interaction strength. For special values of the interaction parameters (a) g= 0, g_ 3 < 0 or (b) g_ 3 +g^ 2 / 2 = 0 and g< 0 we find whole lines of stable fixed points. In certain regions of the g-g_ 3 -plane the RG flow is towards a fixed point without chirality, implying that the effect of the magnetic flux is completely screened.

40|$|Endoscopy is not {{a modern}} {{invention}} but the history of endoscopy goes back to ancient times in Egypt and Greece when speculums were used to inspect the nose cavity, vagina and anorectum. The modern era of endoscopy started in the 19 th century {{with the development of}} straight metallic tubes with primitive light sources, such as Bozzini´s »lichtleiter« and Desormeaux´s »endoscope«. The first gastroscopy was conducted by Kussmaul in 1868 when he attempted to inspect the inside of the stomach by intubating a sword swallower with a 48 cm long straight metallic tube. During this time Bruck placed galvanised wire <b>threads</b> at the <b>tip</b> of the endoscope which markedly improved illumination (»galvanoscope«). In 1888, Nitze successfully made an endoscope with a miniaturized light bulb {{at the tip of the}} instrument. The first practical semi-flexible instrument was developed by Schindler in 1932 allowing deeper intubation into the gastrointestinal tract. Hopkins invention in 1954 of glass fiber bundles transmitting high quality images even if bent made the way for the flexible fiberscope developed by Hirschowitz in 1957. The fiberscope made it possible to use external high intensity light sources »cold light« improving illumination further. In parallel, Uri and Tasaka developed the »gastrocamera« allowing routine endoscopic photography, which remained standard until the incorporation of the CCD camera in the endoscope in 1983. The development of of videoendoscopy in the 1990 s revolutionized endoscopy and made the fiberscopes obsolete. The first capsule endoscopy performed in 1999, which opened up the door to wireless endoscopy. It is interesting that most improvements of endoscopy are the result of an innovative use of inventions from other scientific fields, such as optics, mechanics and photography. How future endoscopy will shape is difficult to guess but, as stated by someone, »the best way to predict the future is to invent it yourself...|$|R
