40|$|This paper investigates {{a method}} to improve buildings' thermal {{predictive}} control performance via online identification and excitation (active learning process) that minimally disrupts normal operations. In previous studies we have demonstrated scalable methods to acquire multi-zone thermal models of passive buildings using a gray-box approach that leverages building topology and measurement data. Here we extend the method to multi-zone actively controlled buildings and examine how to improve the thermal model estimation by using the controller to excite unknown portions of the building's dynamics. Comparing against a baseline <b>thermostat</b> <b>controller,</b> we demonstrate the utility of both the initially acquired and improved thermal models within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, which anticipates weather uncertainty and time-varying temperature set-points. A simulation study demonstrates self-excitation improves model estimation, which corresponds to improved MPC energy savings and occupant comfort. By coupling building topology, estimation, and control routines into a single online framework, we have demonstrated the potential for low-cost scalable methods to actively learn and control buildings to ensure occupant comfort and minimize energy usage, all while using the existing building's HVAC sensors and hardware.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} an interface connecting the two tools : the JPL SCA (Statechart Autocoder) and TuLiP (Temporal Logic Planning Toolbox) to enable the automatic synthesis of low level implementation code directly from formal specifications. With system dynamics, bounds on uncertainty and formal specifications as inputs, TuLiP synthesizes Mealy machines that are correct-by-construction. An interface is built that automatically translates these Mealy machines into UML statecharts. The SCA accepts the UML statecharts (as XML files) to synthesize flight-certified implementation code. The functionality of the interface is demonstrated through three example systems of varying complexity a) a simple thermostat b) a simple speed controller for an autonomous vehicle and c) a more complex speed controller for an autonomous vehicle with a map-element. In the <b>thermostat</b> <b>controller,</b> there is a specification regarding the desired temperature range {{that has to be}} met despite disturbance from the environment. Similarly, in the speed-controllers there are specifications about safe driving speeds depending on sensor health (sensors fail unpredictably) and the map-location. The significance of these demonstrations is the potential circumventing of some of the manual design of statecharts for flight software/controllers. As a result, we expect that less testing and validation will be necessary. In applications where the products of synthesis are used alongside manually designed components, extensive testing or new certificates of correctness of the composition may still be required...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the modeling {{and analysis of}} hybrid systems. Hybrid modeling is an appropriate modeling framework for embedded systems and other real-world applications bridging the gap between continuous dynamical systems and discrete event systems. First, this thesis presents the hybrid systems modeling language and toolkit CHARON. In the following, this thesis then addresses the analysis of hybrid systems using model checking techniques. The goal of a reachability analysis is to either be able to discover bugs in a hybrid system model or {{to be able to}} guarantee that the model is safe with respect to a certain property. This thesis presents algorithms and tools for reachability analysis of hybrid systems by combining the notion of counter-example guided predicate abstraction with recent techniques for approximating the set of reachable states of linear systems using polyhedra. ^ Predicate abstraction has emerged to be a powerful technique for extracting finite-state models from infinite-state discrete programs. Given a hybrid system and a set of predicates, the finite discrete quotient represented by this abstraction is considered. The tool performs an on-the-fly exploration of the abstract system. The success of this scheme crucially depends on the choice of the predicates used for abstraction. Such predicates are identified automatically by analyzing spurious counter-examples generated by the search in the abstract state-space. The basic techniques for guided search in the abstract state-space and techniques to discover new predicates, that will rule out closely related spurious counter-examples, are presented. Additionally, the completeness of the abstraction-based verification strategy is addressed, and it is shown that predicate abstraction of hybrid systems can be used to prove bounded safety. ^ The thesis then describes the integration of the verifier into the overall CHARON framework, and also discusses a variety of case studies that have been verified using this framework. The case studies presented here include, amongst others, a simple <b>thermostat</b> <b>controller,</b> Fischer 2 ̆ 7 s mutual exclusion protocol, a navigational obstacle avoidance protocol, and an automotive adaptive cruise controller. The thesis concludes with a brief overview of ongoing work and possible future research directions. ...|$|E
40|$|Probabilistic {{inference}} {{and reasoning}} {{is applied to}} two major application areas: HVAC controls in buildings and autonomous vehicle perception. Although the physical domains differ vastly, across both applications the presented novel contributions share real-time inference of stochastic systems for improved control capability and performance. Besides performing simple state estimation, Kalman Filters in both applications are extended for model inference-estimating thermal model parameters and disturbances in buildings and dynamic object classification for perception in autonomous vehicles. Part one of this study proposes a general, scalable method to learn controloriented thermal models of buildings that could enable wide-scale deployment of cost-effective predictive controls. An Unscented Kalman Filter augmented for parameter and disturbance estimation is shown to accurately learn and predict a building's thermal response. By leveraging building topology and measurement data, the filter quickly learns parameters of a thermal network during periods of known or constrained loads and then characterizes unknown loads {{in order to provide}} accurate 24 + hour energy predictions. Performance was validated with EnergyPlus simulation data across a year-long study of a passive building. The method is extended to multi-zone actively controlled buildings by using the controller to excite unknown portions of the building's dynamics. A simulation study demonstrates self-excitation improves model estimation. Formalization of parameterization, disturbance estimation, and self-excitation routines is shown with an observability analysis. Comparing against a baseline <b>thermostat</b> <b>controller,</b> a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, which anticipates weather uncertainty and time-varying temperature set-points, is shown to improve energy savings and occupant comfort. Part two of this study presents a novel probabilistic perception algorithm as a real-time joint solution to data association, object tracking, and object classification for an autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) in all-weather conditions. The presented algorithm extends a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter originally built for Cornell's AGV for the DARPA Urban Challenge (DUC) to include multiple model tracking for classification. Additionally a state-of-the-art vision detection algorithm that includes heading information for AGV applications was implemented. Cornell's AGV from the DUC was upgraded and used to experimentally examine if and how state-of-the-art vision algorithms can complement or replace lidar and radar sensors. Sensor and algorithm performance in adverse weather and lighting conditions is tested. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that sensor diversity with a joint probabilistic perception algorithm provides robust all-weather data association, tracking, and classification...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results obtained}} by applying a multi-level methodology {{for the implementation}} of a model-predictive control (MPC) strategy in a large institutional building. The case study building, is a model of a two storey school building, with a floor area of 24, 000 m 2 (258, 000 ft 2) with 46 thermal zones. The zones considered include a large diversity of spaces: small offices, classrooms, long hallways and two gymnasia. A detailed thermal model of the building was created in EnergyPlus. The EnergyPlus was used to generate input and output data employed for a systematic system identification exercise, which resulted in a set of multi-input single-output (MISO) linear models. Three control levels were considered: a thermal zone level (46 models), â€œwingâ€ level (7 models) and a building level (one model). The models identified are state-space representations with order ranging between 4 and 12. This hierarchical, multi-level methodology enables the use of low-order models for each system under consideration: for example, a simple 9 th order model at the building level can be used to predict its thermal load over a 48 -h horizon, with a relatively coarse sampling time of 2 hours (24 samples). At the other extreme, a zone level model has a prediction horizon of 2 hours, and a much finer sampling time of 10 minutes (12 samples). For the MPC studies, a mechanical system considering thermal energy storage devices (ice bank + hot water tank) was considered in the calculations. An optimization routine was carried out to minimize the electricity cost, while maintaining comfortable conditions in the space: a time-of-use rate was employed in the definition of the objective function. The results presented in this paper illustrate how the multi-level concept discussed in this paper can be used to harmonize the performance of building control systems, from the supervisory BEMS to the local <b>thermostat</b> <b>controllers...</b>|$|R

For example, feedback control problems, such as the steady states of the <b>thermostats,</b> where the <b>controllers</b> add or remove heat, depending upon the temperature detected by the sensors in other places, can be interpreted with a second-order ordinary differential equation subject to a nonlocal four-point boundary condition. Singular perturbation problems arise in the heat transfer problems with large Peclet numbers. We show that the solutions of mathematical model, in general, start with fast transient which is the so-called boundary layer phenomenon, and after decay of this transient they remain close to the solution of reduced problem with an arising new fast transient {{at the end of}} considered interval.

30|$|A two-socket digital {{temperature}} <b>controller</b> <b>thermostat</b> {{was connected}} to a power supply and set at 23 °C (lab temperature). A cooling fan {{was connected to}} one of the thermostat socket. The temperature sensor of the thermostat was put through one of the inlet of the coil stands, just below the side coil. This sensor picks up the immediate rise in temperature of the surrounding air due to coil heating and matches it with the set temperature of 23 °C. A higher temperature reading turns on the airflow of the cooling fan and a lower reading turns it off. Meanwhile, the temperature at the centre of the exposure chamber (location of exposed samples) was continuously monitored by a digital thermometer. For maximum current supplied to the coils, the maximum temperature increase of 0.2 °C above the lab temperature of 23 °C was recorded at the centre of the ELF PEMF chamber. It was a good indication that the temperature control setup system efficiently maintains the temperature of exposed samples during the exposures by diffusing any unwanted heat produced via resistive heating of the current carrying coils.|$|R
40|$|Discontinuous {{dynamical}} systems {{arise in}} {{a large number of}} applications. In optimal control problems, open-loop bang-bang controllers switch discontinuously between extreme values of the inputs to generate minimum-time trajectories from the initial to the final states [1]. <b>Thermostats</b> implement on-off <b>controllers</b> to regulate room temperature [2]. When the temperature is above the desired value, the controller switches the cooling system on. Once the temperature reaches a preset value, the controller switches the cooling system off. The controller is therefore a discontinuous function of the room temperature. In nonsmooth mechanics, the motion of rigid bodies is subject to velocity jumps and force discontinuities as a result of friction and impact [3, 4]. In the robotic manipulation of objects by means of mechanical contact [5], discontinuities occur naturally from interaction with the environment. Discontinuities are also intentionally designed to achieve regulation and stabilization. Sliding mode control [6, 7] uses discontinuous feedback controllers for stabilization. The design procedure for sliding mode control begins by identifying a surface in the state space with the property that the dynamics of the system restricted to this surface are easily stabilizable. Feedback controllers are then synthesized {{on each side of the}} surface to steer the solutions of the system toward the surface...|$|R

The gateway controls which data is passed to each slave.An application example is a room temperature controller connected to a heat recovery unit, which is connected to a boiler.

The sequencer includes additional software to increase or decrease the number of running boilers to match the actual heat demand. The sequencer also needs a sensor to measure the temperature of the combined output from the boilers and usually would also control a main circulation pump. What happens after a fault occurs (resequencing remaining units, passing fault messages through for display on the room controller, etc.) is also part of the sequencer functionality. (The hydraulic design of such a system must also take account of different combinations of boilers running at the same time: a Low Loss Header / Hydraulic Separator is usually included to combine the flows from the boilers.) ...|$|R
