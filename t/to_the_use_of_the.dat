5|$|Ape Escape {{is played}} from a third-person perspective. Players {{use a variety}} of gadgets to pursue and capture the apes, {{traversing}} across several environments. The game's controls are heavily centred around the analog sticks, being the first game to require the use of the PlayStation's DualShock. Development of Ape Escape lasted over two years, and was generally focused on adapting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controller, which was a significant challenge for the development team.|$|E
5|$|Beach Thomas {{was opposed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> toothed steel trap for {{catching}} rabbits, supporting the RSPCA {{in its efforts}} to outlaw the device and noting that it both inflicted unnecessary pain and was indiscriminate in nature, sometimes trapping other animals such as domesticated cattle and pet dogs.|$|E
5|$|Chagas {{named the}} {{pathogenic}} parasite as Trypanosoma cruzi and {{later that year}} as Schizotrypanum cruzi, both honoring Oswaldo Cruz, the noted Brazilian physician and epidemiologist who successfully fought epidemics of yellow fever, smallpox, and bubonic plague in Rio de Janeiro and other cities {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century. Chagas was also the first to unknowingly discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus Pneumocystis, later infamously linked to PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia in AIDS victims). Confusion between the two pathogens' life-cycles led him to briefly recognize his genus Schizotrypanum, but following the description of Pneumocystis by others as an independent genus, Chagas returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> name Trypanosoma cruzi.|$|E

5|$|Desiderius Erasmus's early sixteenth-century {{collection}} of Latin proverbs included Turdus malum sibi ipse cacat, (the thrush himself excretes his own trouble), which refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sticky berries favoured by this species to make birdlime for trapping birds. The thrush is literally spreading {{the seeds of}} his own destruction.|$|E
5|$|However, Graham {{suggests}} that Lord Steyn's comments were limited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Parliament Acts {{and would not}} apply to legislation enacted using the ordinary legislative procedure. He also argues {{that it would be}} difficult to explain how courts would refuse to apply legislation unless human rights were involved, citing the example of the removal of judicial review: using fundamental common law principles to interpret legislation is very different from striking down legislation supported by the elected House of Commons, and would be even more contentious if the legislation only substantially modified judicial review procedure.|$|E
5|$|In January 1915 Maunsell {{received}} {{authority to}} build six examples, but, {{as with the}} Nclass, production was delayed due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ashford works for wartime armaments manufacture. Assembly began in 1917 and the first, No.790, emerged in July of that year. It was based at Bricklayers Arms depot, preceding the earlier Nclass design into service by one month. Further construction was deferred until after Ashford had {{caught up with the}} maintenance backlog caused by the war.|$|E

5|$|In XML, a {{namespace}} is {{an abstract}} domain {{to which a}} collection of element and attribute names can be assigned. The namespace name is a character string which must adhere to the generic URI syntax. However, the name is generally {{not considered to be}} a URI, because the URI specification bases the decision not only on lexical components, but also on their intended use. A namespace name does not necessarily imply any of the semantics of URI schemes; for example, a namespace name beginning with http: may have no connotation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HTTP.|$|E
5|$|Later {{observation}} by both SuperWASPs in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres led to {{the collection}} of 13,768 data points between January and May 2010 and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CORALIE spectrograph at La Silla Observatory in Chile. Fourteen measurements using the radial velocity method confirmed WASP-43b as a planet, revealing its mass in the process. The use of La Silla's TRAPPIST telescope helped the science team working on the planet to create a light curve of the planet's transit in December 2010.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence went on {{to build}} a series of ever larger and more {{expensive}} cyclotrons. His Radiation Laboratory became an official department of the University of California in 1936, with Lawrence as its director. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cyclotron for physics, Lawrence also supported its use in research into medical uses of radioisotopes. During World War II, Lawrence developed electromagnetic isotope separation at the Radiation Laboratory. It used devices known as calutrons, a hybrid of the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron. A huge electromagnetic separation plant was built at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which {{came to be called}} Y-12. The process was inefficient, but it worked.|$|E

5|$|The Itanium bus {{interfaces}} to {{the rest}} of the system via a chipset. Enterprise server manufacturers differentiate their systems by designing and developing chipsets that interface the processor to memory, interconnections, and peripheral controllers. The chipset is the heart of the system-level architecture for each system design. Development of a chipset costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, and Intel in 2002, but neither of them developed chipsets to support newer technologies such as DDR2 or PCI Express.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrangement}} of genitalia {{is important in}} courtship and mating as they prevent cross-specific mating and hybridisation. The uniqueness of a species' genitalia led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morphological study of genitalia {{as one of the}} most important keys in taxonomic identification of taxa below family level. With the advent of DNA analysis, the study of genitalia has now become just one of the techniques used in taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|The {{denominations}} in the Latter Day Saint {{movement are}} sometimes collectively {{referred to as}} Mormonism. Although some denominations opposed {{the use of this}} term because they consider it to be derogatory, it is especially used when referring to the largest Latter Day Saint group, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and offshoots of it. Denominations opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term consider it to be connected to the polygamy once practiced by the Utah church.|$|E

5|$|The team {{considered}} {{utilizing the}} PlayStation Move controller for casting spells in the game, {{in a similar}} fashion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> touchscreen in the DS version, though ultimately decided against it as it would limit the potential sales. The battle system was revised over ten times, in order to achieve something new and unique. For about a year of development, the battle system used a turn-based system, though this was ultimately changed when the team felt that it was not fun for players. The team eventually merged turn-based combat and action elements, popular in Japanese and Western regions, respectively, in order to appeal to both regions.|$|E
5|$|Two {{other states}} that were created after the war, Rhineland-Palatinate (French zone) and Lower Saxony (British zone), chose to use the black-red-gold tricolour as their flag, defaced with the state's coat of arms. These two states were formed from parts of other states, and no colour {{combinations}} from these previous states were accepted as a new state flag. This led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black-red-gold for two reasons: the colours did not relate particularly {{to any one of}} the previous states, and using the old flag from the Weimar Republic was intended to be a symbol of the new democracy.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the most}} famous of these bird artists was John James Audubon, whose {{paintings}} of North American birds were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the National Audubon Society. Birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, Homer incorporated nightingales into his Odyssey, and Catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his Catullus 2. The relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term as a metaphor for a 'burden'. Other English metaphors derive from birds; vulture funds and vulture investors, for instance, take their name from the scavenging vulture.|$|E
5|$|English was the {{official}} language of Sarawak from 1963 to 1974 due to opposition from First Chief Minister of Sarawak Stephen Kalong Ningkan <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Malay language in Sarawak. In 1974 the new Chief Minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub recognised Malay alongside English as an official language of Sarawak. This new status given to the Malay language was further reinforced by new education standards transitioning curriculum to Malay. In 1985 English lost the status of an official language, leaving only Malay. Despite official policy, Sarawak opposition members argue that English remained the de facto official language of Sarawak. English is still spoken in the legal courts, and state legislative assembly. In 2015, Chief Minister Adenan Satem announced that English will be reinstated as an official language.|$|E
5|$|General Horace Warfield is put {{in command}} of the Dominion forces to fight the second Zerg invasion, in Wings of Liberty.

His entire family was killed during the Zerg assault on Tarsonis due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> psi-emitters, about which Warfield is rumoured to have provided extremely valuable intelligence.
