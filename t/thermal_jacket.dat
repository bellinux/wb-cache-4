40|$|The partial {{replacement}} of the plants water requirements and the selectionof better genotypes adapted to the water shortage conditions {{can contribute to the}} increaseof water availability in the agriculture. Although the effects of water stresses on the cropdevelopment are known, few reliable methodologies used for its characterizations basedon parameters directly related to the plants exist, aiming to maintain good productivitylevels and to increase the tolerance to water deficiency, mainly due to the difficulties ofenvironmental control of water factor. Based on this focus, the objective of this workwas to characterize the water stress of two maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines by means ofautomatic sap flow (F) measurements with energy balance probes, installed on segmentsof plants stems. The probes are composed of heating electric resistance (<b>thermal</b> <b>jacket)</b> and registering sensors of heat and temperature flow. The <b>thermal</b> <b>jacket</b> supplied aconstant rate of heat to the stem segment. Thermocouples of copper-constantan wereused as sensors to detect the losses of heat from the <b>thermal</b> <b>jacket</b> to the air surroundingthe stem and the temperature differences in the stem segment studied. The automaticacquisition data system involved a datalogger, sensors, a portable computer, a solar paneland rechargeable batteries. A program was used for readings in the probes sensors andcalculations of the sap flow rates. An equation, expressing the plants water stress index(PWSI) and involving terms of the measured F rates under two water regime conditions(non stressed and stressed), was used in the water stress characterization. The resultsindicated that the probes were sensible to detect variation of sap flow and the PWSI wasan appropriate methodology for water stress characterization of the two maize inbredlines investigated; the total leaf area of the two studied inbred lines was reduced by thewater stress condition; the maize inbred line L 1170 presented smaller values of sap flowand was more sensible (larger values) to the PWSI studied, the maize inbred line L 13. 1. 2 presented larger values of sap flow and was more tolerant to PWSI (smaller values) ...|$|E
30|$|Generally, the {{hydrogel}} injection setup {{has different}} parts (Bravo and Araujo 2008). Its main part is a core holder, <b>thermal</b> <b>jacket,</b> temperature controller (120  °C with 1  °C accuracy), injection pumps (0.01 – 32  mL/min and 600  bar), overburden pressure pump (ultra-high pressure hand pump from Enerpack, US, 5800 psi) to apply external {{pressure on the}} core. During the hydrogel injection, a 290 psi overburden pressure was applied, while the temperature was kept at 90  °C.

Thereafter, the sandpack was kept at 90  °C until the gelation time of the hydrogel was reached based on the bottle test results.|$|E
40|$|Today {{there is}} a need to provide {{thermally}} efficient walls, while at the same time to increase the mechanical properties of old unreinforced masonry walls that will not require large amounts of energy in the retrofitting or deconstruction processes. To address this problem, this paper gives the results of shear tests carried out on masonry panels made of solid bricks retrofitted with a new technique based on the use of glass fiber-reinforced polymers (GFRP) grids inserted into a <b>thermal</b> insulating <b>jacketing.</b> This was made of different low-strength lime-based mortars. Tests were carried out in laboratory and results were used for the determination of the shear modulus and strength of the wall panels before and after the application of the GFRP reinforcement. Retrofitted panels exhibited a significant enhancement in the lateral capacity when compared to the control panels. The thermal performance of the proposed mortars was also investigated both with and without GFRP. Low values of thermal conductivity were found, especially for the samples with GFRP; a reduction of the thermal transmittance value in the 34 – 45 % range was also obtained by applying 45 mm layer of coating in conventional masonry walls...|$|R
40|$|Foaming {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{problems}} that occasionally occurring in biogas plants affecting negatively the overall anaerobic digestion (AD) process. According to a recent survey, 15 out of 16 full-scale biogas plants, which were surveyed in Denmark, faced foaming incidents in the main reactor and/or in the pre-storage feeding tank, resulting in 30 - 50 % biogas production loss (Kougias et al., 2014). In activated sludge systems and in wastewater treatment plants the major causes of foaming are organic overload, the presence of surface active agents, operational parameters (e. g. digester’s shape, mixing system etc) and filamentous microorganisms (e. g. Gordonia species, Microthrix parvicella) (Ganidi et al., 2009). However, the contribution of specific microorganisms on foam generation in biogas reactors fed with agro-industrial wastes has not been previously investigated. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the microbiology of biogas reactors fed with different substrates prior and after foaming incidents. The experiment was carried out in three continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR) denoted as R 1, R 2 and R 3. The total and the working volume of each reactor was 2 and 1. 5 L, respectively. Each reactor was continuously stirred using a magnetic stirrer. The operating temperature was maintained at 54 ± 1 °C using <b>thermal</b> <b>jackets.</b> Each reactor was fed with a different mixed substrate, which was found to have an influence on foam formation in our previous study (Kougias et al., 2013). The hydraulic retention time (HRT) of all reactors was kept constant at 15 days. The whole experiment was divided into two periods. During the first period, the reactors were fed only with cattle manure. Once steady state conditions were reached, liquid sample from all reactors was obtained for DNA extraction and metagenomic analysis. After sampling, the feedstock composition of each reactor was changed by the addition of gelatine or Na-Oleate or glucose (second experimental period). As a consequence, foam formation was observed in all reactors approximately after one HRT period. Once the daily volume of the formed foam was steady, samples were taken again for DNA extraction and metagenomic analysis. Results from the present study revealed significant variations in the microbiology of the manure-based biogas reactors after foam initiation. A number of genera could be linked to foaming as they produce biosurfactants (Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Thermotoga), others contain mycolic acid in their cell wall (Thermoactinomyces, Pseudonocardia) or decrease the surface tension of the media (Micrococcus, Streptococcus). Frankia, Dialister and Paenibacillus are known to be correlated to this phenomenon but their mechanism is still unclear. Finally, microorganisms that have a widely known association with foaming were identified when the identification threshold for the microorganisms was decreased to similar levels reported in the cited literature; however, the latter, due to its high importance, needs to be further investigated.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the {{radiative}} properties of personal protective clothings worn during firefighting operations by firemen. Several intervention jackets are tested coming from different Fire and Rescue Services in France. The present study focuses on the spectral absorptivity of these equipments over visible–IR domains. The spectral absorptivity in the IR range is mainly responsible for the conversion of radiative transfer coming from the flame into heat flux through the protective jacket. This work shows that the mean absorptivities of different equipments are high, close to 90 %, which penalizes the thermal protection. This study demonstrates that the colored textile has a weak effect on the radiative properties {{and then on the}} thermal protection. On the contrary, the dyeing mode can decrease the absorptivity, hence improving the <b>thermal</b> protection of <b>jackets,</b> a dyed jacket being more efficient in the present test than a jacket made of fibers dyed before weaving. Finally, this paper presents mean absorptivities based on Planck's averages for reference temperatures between 800 K and 1400 K, allowing to compare different personal protective clothings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Glass lined {{reactor vessel}} for mixing and storage {{has a unique}} {{advantage}} of higher corrosion resistance, retention of product flavour and purity, improved heat transfer and less frequent cleaning. Welding close to the glass-lined surface is at times the unavoidable need. However, such needs are to be dealt critically as {{the rise in the}} temperature of the glass-lined surface can lead to a failure of glass-lining. This failure results in considerable delay as rework in lining the glass takes 5 - 7 days and it involves considerable extra cost of reworking. The glass lined reactor vessels are provided with <b>jacket</b> for <b>thermal</b> insulation. The <b>jacket</b> is welded to main vessel by a closure ring. CO 2 welding in the root run and Sub-merged Arc Welding (SAW) process for subsequent passes. The cooling time of 15 to 20 minutes is provided between the successive SAW passes so that the shell surface cools down and temperature does not exceed the failure limit of glass-lining. The temperature measurements were initially measured with infrared pyrometer and Results are compared with thermal analysis by FEA. We see in the final pass of SAW process the temperature exceeds 100 ˚C though the cooling time of 15 - 20 minutes is provided between the successive passes and temperature does not exceeds the failure limit of 150 ˚C as well as the 3 - 4 ˚C/min temperature difference in heating and cooling rates...|$|R
40|$|CHATS on Applied Superconductivity Workshop (CHAT-AS), Dept Elect, Elect & Informat Engn, Bologna, ITALY, SEP 14 - 16, 2015 International audienceIn a Cable In Conduit Conductor (CICC) cooled by forced {{circulation}} of supercritical helium, the heat exchange in the bundle region {{can play a}} significant role for conductor safe operation, while remaining a quite uncertain parameter. Heat exchange between bundle and jacket depends on the relative contributions of convective heat transfer due to the helium flow inside the bundle and of thermal resistance due to the wrappings between the cable and the conduit. In order to qualify this thermal coupling at realistic operating conditions, a dedicated experiment on a 1. 2 m sample of ITER Toroidal Field (TF) dummy conductor was designed and performed in the HELIOS test facility at CEA Grenoble. Several methods were envisaged, and the choice was made to assess bundle jacket heat transfer coefficient by measuring the temperature of a solid copper cylinder inserted over the conductor jacket and submitted to heat deposition on its outer surface. The mock-up was manufactured and tested in spring 2015. Bundle jacket heat transfer coefficient was found in the range 300 - 500 W m(- 2) K- 1. Results analysis suggests that the order of magnitude of convective heat transfer coefficient inside bundle is closer to Colburn-Reynolds analogy than to Dittus-Boelter correlation, and that bundle <b>jacket</b> <b>thermal</b> coupling is mainly limited by thermal resistance due to wrappings. A model based on an equivalent layer of stagnant helium between wraps and jacket was proposed and showed a good consistency with the experiment, with relevant values for the helium layer thickness.

40|$|The Solar Rating and Certification Corporation (SRCC) has {{established}} a standardized methodology for determining the performance rating of the Solar Domestic Hot Water (SDHW) systems it certifies under OG- 300. Measured performance data for the solar collector component(s) of the system are used along with numerical models for {{the balance of the}} system to calculate the system`s thermal performance under a standard set of rating conditions. SRCC uses TRNSYS to model each of the components that comprise the system. The majority of the SRCC certified systems include a thermal storage tank with an auxiliary electrical heater. The most common being a conventional fifty gallon electric tank water heater. Presently, the thermal losses from these tanks are calculated using Q = U {center_dot} A {center_dot} {Delta}T. Unfortunately, this generalized formula does not adequately address temperature stratification both within the tank {{as well as in the}} ambient air surrounding the tank, non-uniform insulation <b>jacket,</b> <b>thermal</b> siphoning in the fluid lines attached to the tank, and plumbing fittings attached to the tank. This study is intended to address only that part of the problem that deals with the plumbing fittings attached to the tank. Heat losses from a storage tank and its plumbing fittings involve three different operating modes: charging, discharging and standby. In the charging mode, the tank receives energy from the solar collector. In the discharge mode, water flows from the storage tank through the distribution pipes to the faucets and cold city water enters the tank. In the standby mode, there is no forced water flow into or out of the tank. In this experimental study, only the standby mode was considered...|$|R
