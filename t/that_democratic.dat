5|$|In 1942, {{a debate}} on the {{national}} question in Europe opened up between {{the majority of the}} SWP and a movement led by Van Heijenoort, Albert Goldman and Felix Morrow. This minority anticipated that the Nazi dictatorship would be replaced with capitalism rather than by a socialist revolution, leading to the revival of Stalinism and social democracy. In December 1943, they criticised the SWP's view as underestimating the rising prestige of Stalinism and the opportunities for the capitalists to use democratic concessions. The SWP's central committee argued <b>that</b> <b>democratic</b> capitalism could not revive, resulting in either military dictatorship by the capitalists or a workers' revolution. It held that this would reinforce the need for building the Fourth International, and adhered rigidly to their interpretation of Trotsky's works.|$|E
5|$|Preckwinkle {{chairs the}} ward organization, the Fourth Ward Democratic Organization, {{which was one}} of sixteen Chicago Democratic ward {{organizations}} named in a complaint filed on August 31, 2005 with the Illinois State Board of Elections by the Cook County Republican Party charging <b>that</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party ward organizations are illegally housed in City-funded neighborhood ward offices. Taxpayers fund aldermanic service centers, which are open to the public. State law prohibits the use of public funds by any candidate for political or campaign purposes. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of nine that a Hearing Officer appointed by the Board recommended proceed to the next step of the hearing process, an Open Preliminary Hearing. On October 17, 2005, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Elections, the Board entered an executive session and voted, in a 4–4 tie, along strict party lines, failing to adopt the recommendation of the Hearing Officer, and ordered the complaints dismissed. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of eight that the Cook County Republican Party appealed {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court of Illinois. On January 23, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ordered the Illinois appellate court to conduct a judicial review of the Board's dismissals of the complaints.|$|E

25|$|Initially, {{as shown}} by his choice of taking his seat in uniform, Hopkinson was {{particularly}} active on military matters, calling for 'democracy under discipline' and a recognition <b>that</b> <b>democratic</b> forces were present when reconstructing the Army. He {{was a member of}} the House of Commons Army Committee in 1919, and the following year criticised the actions of Brigadier-General Dyer in the Amritsar massacre following the official report into it. Also in 1920 he criticised bureaucracy in the building of public housing, saying that he was building homes for a fraction of the price (it was in 1921 that he made his donation of Ryecroft Hall).|$|E
25|$|According to Jeffrey Sachs, an American economist, {{the major}} problem of Why Nations Fail is that it focuses too {{narrowly}} on domestic political institutions and ignores other factors, such as technological progress and geopolitics. For example, geography {{plays an important role}} in shaping institutions, and weak governments in West Africa may be seen as a consequence of the unnavigable rivers in the region. Sachs also questions Acemoglu and Robinson's assumption that authoritarian regimes cannot motivate economic growth. Several examples in Asia, including Singapore and South Korea, easily refute Acemoglu and Robinson's arguments <b>that</b> <b>democratic</b> political institutions are prerequisites for economic growth. Moreover, Acemoglu and Robinson overlook macroeconomic factors like technological progress (e.g. industrialization and information technology).|$|E
25|$|Stanton's law efforts stalled when he {{was called}} on in August 1868 by Robert C. Schenck, the Republican {{candidate}} for one of Ohio's seats in the House of Representatives. Schneck's rival, Democrat Clement Vallandigham, was well-known among Republicans for his Copperhead politics, and disliked by Stanton. Believing <b>that</b> <b>Democratic</b> victory at any level would imperil {{the results of the}} war, and nullify Republican efforts during the war, Stanton went on a tour of Ohio to campaign for Schenck, other Ohio Republicans and Grant, the Republican presidential nominee. Meanwhile, Stanton's health continued to deteriorate. His physician warned him against making lengthy speeches as his asthma irritated him severely. Stanton's illness precipitated his return to Washington in early November. His feeble state was replaced by excitement when Republicans were victorious in the Schenck–Vallandingham race, and the presidential election.|$|E

25|$|His {{two main}} {{findings}} are that leaders actually do not lie {{very much to}} other countries, and <b>that</b> <b>democratic</b> leaders are actually more likely than autocrats to lie to their own people. Thus, he starts his book by {{saying that it is}} not surprising that Saddam Hussein did not lie about having WMD—he truthfully said he had none—but that George Bush and some of his key advisors did lie to the American people about the threat from Iraq. Mearsheimer argues that leaders are most likely to lie to their own people in democracies that fight wars of choice in distant places. He says that it is difficult for leaders to lie to other countries because there is not much trust among them, especially when security issues are at stake, and you need trust for lying to be effective. He says that it is easier for leaders to lie to their own people because there is usually a good deal of trust between them.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party {{also has}} {{considerable}} {{support in the}} small but growing Asian American population. The Asian American population had been a stronghold of the Republican Party until the United States presidential election of 1992 in which George H. W. Bush won 55% of the Asian American vote, compared to Bill Clinton winning 31%, and Ross Perot winning 15% of the Asian vote. Originally, {{the vast majority of}} Asian Americans consisted of strongly anti-communist, pro-democracy Vietnamese refugees, Chinese Americans, Taiwanese Americans, Korean Americans, and socially conservative Filipinos who fled Ferdinand Marcos in the 1960s through the 1980s, and the general Republican Party's socially conservative, fervently anti-communist position strongly resonated with this original demographic. The Democratic party made gains among the Asian American population starting with 1996 and in 2006, won 62% of the Asian American vote. Exit polls after the 2008 presidential election indicated <b>that</b> <b>Democratic</b> candidate, Barack Obama won 62% of the Asian American vote nationwide. In the 2012 Presidential election, 73% of the Asian American electorate voted for Obama's re-election.|$|E

25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the Cold War, an American {{political}} consensus {{began to}} emerge suggesting <b>that</b> <b>democratic</b> transition should be actively supported – a consensus only more firmly established following the dissolution of the Soviet Union when the United States found itself in less of a difficult position balancing security concerns and promotion of its ideals. This was based in part on democratic peace theory, which added a security element to democracy promotion. The Middle East was not excluded from this discussion, with some calling for increased American democracy promotion as a means of encouraging more peaceful relations with Israel and moderating extremists, while not {{going so far as to}} destabilize friendly autocratic regimes. The assumption that a positive relationship exists between democratic governance and peace which was prominent in the 1990s faced some inconsistency in the Middle East, however, because regimes that engaged to some extent in the peace process with Israel (and in the case of Jordan successfully reached a peace agreement) at the same time slowly and half-heartedly pursued democratization and allowed little opening to opposition movements who resisted negotiation with Israel.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt was {{a member}} of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 21st D.) in 1882, 1883 and 1884. He {{immediately}} began making his mark, specifically in corporate corruption issues. He blocked a corrupt effort by financier Jay Gould to lower his taxes. Roosevelt exposed suspected collusion in the matter by Judge Theodore Westbrook, and argued for and received approval for an investigation to proceed, aiming for the impeachment of the judge. The investigation committee rejected impeachment, but Roosevelt had exposed the potential corruption in Albany, and thus assumed a high and positive political profile in multiple New York publications. Roosevelt's anti-corruption efforts helped him win re-election in 1882 by a margin greater than two-to-one, an achievement made even more impressive by the fact <b>that</b> <b>Democratic</b> gubernatorial candidate Grover Cleveland won Roosevelt's district. With Conkling's Stalwart faction of the Republican Party in disarray following the assassination of President James Garfield, Roosevelt won election as the Republican party leader in the state assembly. He allied with Governor Cleveland to win passage of a civil service reform bill. Roosevelt won re-election a second time, and sought the office of Speaker of the New York State Assembly, but was defeated by Titus Sheard in a 41 to 29 vote of the GOP caucus. In his final term, Roosevelt served as Chairman of the Committee on Affairs of Cities; he wrote more bills than any other legislator.|$|E
500|$|In 1958, the Independent Socialist League led by Max Shachtman {{dissolved}} to {{join the}} Socialist Party of America. Shachtman had written that Soviet communism was {{a new form of}} class society, bureaucratic collectivism, in which the ruling class exploited and oppressed the population, and therefore he opposed the spread of communism. Shachtman also argued <b>that</b> <b>democratic</b> socialists should work with activists from labor unions and civil-rights organizations [...] to help build a social-democratic [...] "realignment" [...] of the Democratic Party. Though he died on 4 November 1972 and had little involvement with the Socialist Party in the year proceeding his death, his followers, identitified as [...] "Shachmanites", exercised a tremendous amount of influence on the party.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the first}} {{professional}} campaign managers; Chotiner was retained as a political consultant by Nixon's 1946 campaign for Congress against incumbent Representative Jerry Voorhis. He advised linking Voorhis with a political action committee, believed to be communist-dominated, run by the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The consultant was only able to devote {{a limited amount of}} time to the Nixon campaign since he was the Southern California campaign manager for the successful re-election bid of Republican Senator William F. Knowland. Chotiner coined the campaign slogan, [...] "We will not surrender" [...] for Knowland, implying <b>that</b> <b>Democratic</b> challenger Will Rogers, Jr. would permit communism to take over the country. Both Republican candidates defeated their opponents. Two years later, Chotiner served as Southern California campaign manager for the unsuccessful 1948 presidential bid of New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey.|$|E
500|$|In {{many ways}} Norwegian society {{embodied}} the British radical ideal of [...] "a small-producer society, its wealth sufficiently dispersed to ensure rough equality", {{similar to what}} Wollstonecraft had outlined in A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790). After careful consideration of how to improve {{the social and political}} problems in the places she visited, Wollstonecraft {{came to the conclusion that}} social progress must occur at a measured and [...] "natural" [...] rate. She argues that each country has to find its own way to improve, <b>that</b> <b>democratic</b> revolution cannot be foisted upon a people. She believed that the lower classes and the yeomen were the most promising [...] "potential source of revolutionary social transformation". Implicit in her assessment, however, was a bourgeois condescension; she viewed the lower classes as a group separate from herself, at one point describing their behavior as [...] "picturesque".|$|E
500|$|Hergé's use of {{research}} and photographic reference allowed him to build a realised universe for Tintin, {{going so far as}} to create fictionalised countries, dressing them with specific political cultures. These were heavily informed by the cultures evident in Hergé's lifetime. Pierre Skilling has asserted that Hergé saw monarchy as [...] "the legitimate form of government", noting <b>that</b> <b>democratic</b> [...] "values seem underrepresented in [...] a classic Franco-Belgian strip". Syldavia in particular is described in considerable detail, Hergé creating a history, customs, and a language, which is actually a Slavic-looking transcript of Marols, a working-class Brussels dialect. He set the country in the Balkans, and it is, by his own admission, modelled after Albania. The country finds itself threatened by neighbouring Borduria, with an attempted annexation appearing in King Ottokar's Sceptre. This situation parallels the Italian conquest of Albania, and that of Czechoslovakia and Austria by expansionist Nazi Germany prior to World War II.|$|E
