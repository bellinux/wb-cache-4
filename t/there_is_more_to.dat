25|$|When Hercule Poirot's own dentist, Henry Morley, {{is found}} dead from a gunshot wound, the {{official}} verdict {{is that he}} has killed himself; a verdict apparently supported when it appears that he has given one of his patients a fatal overdose of anaesthetic.

25|$|When {{the elderly}} Zapparoni finally makes his entrance, Richard senses his latent power, {{remarking}} that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> him than his intelligence. In a narrative aside {{prompted by a}} question from Zapparoni, Richard contrasts his former comrades Fillmor, Lorenz, and Twinnings. Unlike either Lorenz and Twinnings, Fillmor, now a successful high officer, is driven entirely by ambition, yet totally lacks imagination. So when Zapparoni asks Richard for his opinion on Fillmor’s memoir, Richard is unsure how to respond. Over {{the course of a}} tactical conversation, Zapparoni begins with familiar territory for Richard, namely war, yet is quickly able to master the discussion, forcing Richard into contortions and self-contradictions. Zapparoni then announces that he has other matters to attend to, and asks Richard to wait for him in the garden, warning him to beware of the bees.|$|E

25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that you know you would not have brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life interesting is that we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E

Author Simon Leng writes that [...] ", and Harrison's leadership of the Beatles into Vedic philosophy, sparked the entire fashion for Indian music and a million backpackers' pilgrimages to Kashmir..." [...] Juan Mascaró, a professor in Sanskrit studies at Cambridge University, wrote to Harrison after the song's release, saying: [...] "it is a moving song, and may it move the souls of millions.

500|$|After Harrison {{has named}} Rolling Stone {{as the main}} {{perpetrator}} of his anguish, Leng suggests that {{he is unable to}} sustain the previous [...] "artifice", whereby the lyrics' shift in perspective from first-person to third-person represented the apparently [...] "happy" [...] private man versus the [...] "wounded" [...] musician, as [...] "personified by his guitar". Instead, Harrison [...] "flays his detractors" [...] in the song's subsequent verses. These final verses contain the rhyming couplets [...] "Thought by now you knew the score / You missed the point just like before" [...] and [...] "While you attack, create offence / I'll put it down to your ignorance". Music critic Lindsay Planer describes the lines as [...] "suggesting that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> Harrison's music than is being taken into consideration by narrow-minded journalists".|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Scully and Reyes {{are getting}} ready for bed. [...] Scully {{suddenly}} calls Reyes and asks her what her assigned numerology [...] "number" [...] is. [...] Reyes informs Scully she is a [...] "9" [...] which means she has risen above the other numbers and understands that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> life than this world. [...] The clock shows us that it is 9:09 pm. [...] In a nearby Italian neighborhood, an Italian festival is in progress. [...] Two men sing a jovial song in Italian and lead a crowd through the streets. [...] The camera zooms out to reveal that the entire neighborhood, when viewed from above, suggests the appearance of Burt's face, hinting at the fact that he might be God.|$|E
500|$|Puzzles {{in a given}} {{section of}} the island are {{presented}} in a non-linear fashion, and with the open world nature of the game, the player may encounter puzzle panels that {{they have yet to}} learn the symbolic language for. As such, players are not required to finish a puzzle once they start, and can leave and wander to any other area to solve the puzzles there, potentially gaining insight on the new symbolic language or inspiration for difficult solutions. Blow has stated that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the game than these mazes, in response to concerns from players; to Blow, [...] "the point is the magic that happens in the player's mind when he understands the subtle things that the mazes are saying - because the mazes aren't just puzzles, they are lines of communication that aggregate, become more complex and eventually say surprising things".|$|E

500|$|After {{graduating from}} Oxford in 1943 with a first in English {{language}} and literature, Larkin became a librarian. It {{was during the}} thirty years he worked with distinction as university librarian at the Brynmor Jones Library at the University of Hull that he produced {{the greater part of}} his published work. His poems are marked by what Andrew Motion calls [...] "a very English, glum accuracy about emotions, places, and relationships", and what Donald Davie described as [...] "lowered sights and diminished expectations". Eric Homberger (echoing Randall Jarrell) called him [...] "the saddest heart in the post-war supermarket"—Larkin himself said that deprivation for him was what daffodils were for Wordsworth. Influenced by W. H. Auden, W. B. Yeats, and Thomas Hardy, his poems are highly structured but flexible verse forms. They were described by Jean Hartley, the ex-wife of Larkin's publisher George Hartley (the Marvell Press), as a [...] "piquant mixture of lyricism and discontent", though anthologist Keith Tuma writes that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> Larkin's work than its reputation for dour pessimism suggests.|$|E
500|$|Architectural experts {{sometimes}} {{differ in}} their interpretations of Kahn's design. [...] Why, for example, are the cross beams at the clerestory windows above the atrium so massive? Carter Wiseman says, [...] "While they appear to be—and indeed are—structural, they are far deeper than necessary; their no-less-important role was to diffuse the sunlight {{coming in from the}} surrounding clerestory windows and reflect it down into the atrium." [...] Sarah Goldhagen thinks <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the story, asserting that [...] "the concrete X-shaped cross below the skylit ceiling at the Exeter Library is grossly exaggerated for dramatic effect." [...] Kathleen James-Chakraborty goes even further: [...] "Above, in the most sublime gesture of all, floats a concrete cross brace, illuminated by clerestory windows. [...] Its weight, which appears ready to come crashing down upon the onlooker, revives the sense of threat dissipated elsewhere by the reassuring familiarity of the brick skin and wood details." [...] Kahn similarly floated a massive concrete structure above the sanctuary of the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, which he designed a few years earlier.|$|E
500|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the first}} season in late May 2009, actor Kirk Acevedo {{announced}} he was [...] "fired" [...] off of the show from his Facebook page. Executive producer Jeff Pinkner denied it soon after, explaining that [...] "like all things on Fringe, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> this story than meets the eye" [...] and reminded viewers that an alternate version of his character had already appeared in a first season episode. Later that summer at Comic-Con in July he reiterated that [...] "rumors of Charlie's demise are premature," [...] and at the August Television Critics Association press tour he commented about Charlie possibly showing up in the previously visited parallel universe. [...] "Momentum Deferred" [...] marked the actor's last appearance in the prime universe. In response to why the character was killed off, Entertainment Weeklys Michael Ausiello reported that the [...] "storyline dictated. Charlie wasn't going to have much to do this season, and rather than waste Kirk's time, they cut him loose". The character's doppelganger from the parallel universe returned in the season finale [...] "Over There".|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} quietly {{revealed}} to the public by Blow at the 2010 Penny Arcade Expo {{with the help of}} independent developers Chris Hecker and Andy Schatz, who were sharing booth space for demonstrations of their own games, SpyParty and the two provided a table for demonstrating The Witness without any signs or other markings. Blow wanted to keep the demonstration subtle and a surprise and to see players' reactions without the pressure of other players waiting in line to also try the game. Blow himself was present at the Expo but kept his distance from the demonstration table. The fact that The Witness was playable at the Expo was only fully revealed after the Expo by both Blow and Stephen Totilo of Kotaku, who saw and played the game but did not mention its presence until later. Players who tried the game at PAX or saw footage of it from the Kotaku article afterwards became concerned that The Witness would simply be a series of mazes to solve. Blow reiterated that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the game than mazes, and that he encountered similar problems when trying to promote Braid, in that seeing videos of portions of the game does not serve to demonstrate [...] "what happens in the player's mind during the puzzle-solving process".|$|E
500|$|In a twist from expectation, Eliot's poem {{suggests}} that old men {{should go out}} and explore. He warns that people should trade wisdom for pointless experience and argues that men should explore human experience itself. This concept is hinted of in The Waste Land and draws from the ideas within Dante's Convivio. Dante argues that old men are supposed to return to God and describes the process in a way similar to the travels of Odysseus. Unlike Homer's hero, Dante argues that men should not travel in the material world but in the spiritual world. Both Dante and Eliot put forth a similar view to St. Augustine when they focus on internal travels. Through these travels, mankind is able to have faith in salvation and {{able to see that}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the world than darkness. Eliot explains within the poem that we are all interconnected through time and that we must realize this. Only through this realization is mankind able to understand the truth of the universe. This, in turn, would allow humanity to break free from the burden of time. As Russel Kirk explains: [...] "That end, for those who apprehend a reality superior to 'birth, copulation, and death'—a reality transcending the rhythms of physical nature—is to know God and enjoy Him forever." ...|$|E
500|$|Adam Baldwin as Jayne Cobb– a mercenary. He and Mal {{met when}} they were on {{opposite}} sides of a dispute; Mal, while held at gunpoint, offered Jayne his own bunk and a higher cut than his current employer, so Jayne switched sides and shot his then-partners. In the original pilot, [...] "Serenity", he intimates to Mal that he did not betray him because [...] "The money wasn't good enough." [...] However, previously he had pointedly asked the Alliance agent whether he would be required to turn on the captain to help him, and in [...] "Ariel" [...] defends his actions in alerting the authorities regarding Simon and River by claiming he had not intended to betray Mal. He is someone who can be depended on in a fight. He tends to act like a [...] "lummox" [...] who thinks he is the smartest person in space, but occasional hints of intelligence peek through this façade, giving the impression that he acts dumber than he is. As Whedon states several times, Jayne is the man who will ask the questions that no one else wants to. Even though he is a macho character, he has shown a particularly intense fear of Reavers, more so {{than the rest of the}} crew. Despite his amoral mercenary persona, he sends a significant portion of his income to his mother, again suggesting that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> his character than what he presents to the rest of the crew.|$|E
