5|$|Before Æthelberht's {{death in}} 616 {{a number of}} other bishoprics had been {{established}} but after that date, a pagan backlash set in and the see, or bishopric, of London was abandoned. Æthelberht's daughter, Æthelburg, married Edwin, the king of the Northumbrians, and by 627 Paulinus, the bishop who accompanied her north, had converted Edwin and {{a number of other}} Northumbrians. When Edwin died, in about 633, his widow and Paulinus were forced to flee to Kent. Although the missionaries could not remain in all of <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>they</b> had evangelised, by the time the last of them died in 653, they had established Christianity in Kent and the surrounding countryside and contributed a Roman tradition to the practice of Christianity in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Poison dart frog (also {{known as}} dart-poison frog, poison frog or {{formerly}} known as poison arrow frog) is the common name {{of a group of}} frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to tropical Central and South America. These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies. This bright coloration is correlated with the toxicity of the species, making them aposematic. Some species of the family Dendrobatidae exhibit extremely bright coloration along with high toxicity, while others have cryptic coloration with minimal to no amount of observed toxicity. The species that have great toxicity derive this from their diet of ants, mites and termites. Other species however, that exhibit cryptic coloration and low to no amounts of toxicity, eat a much larger variety of prey. Many species of this family are threatened due to human infrastructure encroaching <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>they</b> inhabit.|$|E
5|$|Special {{behavioral}} {{features of}} the dromedary include snapping at others without biting them and showing displeasure by stamping their feet. They are generally non-aggressive, {{with the exception of}} rutting males. They appear to remember their homes; females in particular remember <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>they</b> first gave birth or suckled their offspring. Males become aggressive in the mating season, and sometimes wrestle. A 1980 study showed androgen levels in males influences their behaviour. Between January and April when these levels are high during the rut, they become difficult to manage, blow out the palate from the mouth, vocalise and throw urine over their backs. Camels scratch parts of their bodies with their legs or with their lower incisors. They may also rub against tree bark and roll in sand.|$|E

25|$|During Soviet times, apartments were lent {{to people}} by the {{government}} according to the square meters-per-person norm (some groups, including people's artists, heroes and prominent scientists had bonuses according to their honors).

25|$|In 1857 a {{concordat}} {{was entered}} into between the Holy See and Portugal, pending {{the execution of}} which both the vicars Apostolic and the authorities of the diocese were to enjoy pacific possession of <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>they</b> actually held. But the Crown of Portugal undertook manifestly too great a burden, to wit, {{to provide for the}} spiritual needs of the whole of India, and consequently the concordat remained a dead letter. In 1854 the Royal Missionary College of Bomjardim at Sernache, Portugal was founded for the training of secular priests for the Portuguese missions beyond the seas. Meanwhile the missions of the diocese had been greatly weakened by secessions to the vicars Apostolic. The missions were situated in British territory and as beyond the clergy there were scarcely any Portuguese subjects to be found throughout the diocese there was no particular inducement or the people to cling to the see.|$|E

25|$|Admission {{for senior}} high schools, {{especially}} selective high schools, is somewhat {{similar to the}} one for universities in China. Students will go through an application system where they may choose the high schools at which they wish to study in an order to their preference before the high schools set out their entrance requirements. Once this is completed and the high schools will announce their requirements based on this information and <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>they</b> will offer in that year. For instance, if the school offers 800 places in that year, the results offered by the 800th intake student will be the standard requirements. So effectively, this ensures the school selects the top candidates in all the students who have applied to said school in that academic year. However, the severe competition only occurs in the very top high schools, normally, most students will have sufficient results for them to continue their secondary education if they wish to.|$|E
25|$|Gazetteers {{are often}} {{categorized}} by the type, and scope, {{of the information}} presented. World gazetteers usually consist of an alphabetical listing of countries, with pertinent statistics for each one, with some gazetteers listing information on individual cities, towns, villages, and other settlements of varying sizes. Short-form gazetteers, often {{used in conjunction with}} computer mapping and GIS systems, may simply contain a list of place-names together with their locations in latitude and longitude or other spatial referencing systems (e.g.,British National Grid reference). Short-form gazetteers appear as a place–name index in the rear of major published atlases. Descriptive gazetteers may include lengthy textual descriptions of <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>they</b> contain, including explanation of industries, government, geography, together with historical perspectives, maps and/or photographs. Thematic gazetteers list places or geographical features by theme; for example fishing ports, nuclear power stations, or historic buildings. Their common element is that the geographical location is an important attribute of the features listed.|$|E

He forgoes subtlety as he raps, [...] "Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol/ Slid the panties right to the side/ Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight... your breasteses is my breakfast".

[...] He then performed several interviews from 12–13March, including Fortune and Judith Natus, and a witness who could cast doubt on John Iniser's testimony. [...] Gascoyne also asked George and Lucy Squires about their travels early in 1753; George was unable to recall all <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>they</b> had visited, and so Gascoyne sent him to Dorset to help him remember. [...] Gascoyne then met with Elizabeth Long (Wells's daughter), who had been prevented by the mob from testifying for her mother, and on 23March three of Canning's former witnesses expressed to Gascoyne their doubts about the young maid's story. [...] Another witness, who swore that Squires had been in Abbotsbury in January, was interviewed two days later. [...] Gascoyne instructed him to visit Squires in Newgate, where the two recognised one another immediately.|$|E

She noted, [...] "the way the script was {{originally}} read to me, initially {{seemed to me}} as if Scully kind of {{stepped up to the plate}} and played along with the sheriff's humor". She reportedly performed her lines in a [...] "tongue in cheek"-esque way before receiving a call from Carter. He informed her that her lines were not meant to be humorous and that the production staff was having to [...] "edit out a lot of stuff" [...] in order to make up for this. Several of the scenes in the episode were shot at <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>they</b> stood in for. The gas station scene was filmed at a real gas station across from the series' production headquarters. The supermarket shots were filmed in an actual supermarket, Shop Easy in Port Coquitlam, a first for the series, according to art director Greg Loewen.
