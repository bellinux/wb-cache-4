5|$|The {{original}} engine propelling <b>the</b> <b>carousel</b> was a belt-driven mechanism, {{but after}} the initial restoration it was exchanged for a fluid drive provided by the Kissell Brothers Amusement Rides company of Cincinnati, Ohio, who suggested the platform for <b>the</b> <b>carousel</b> be improved. To provide crowd control, a pavilion was built over <b>the</b> <b>carousel</b> and a ticket booth was installed. Neither was based on any extant buildings, but each was a composite of several other structures. The animals are removed {{one at a time}} from <b>the</b> <b>carousel</b> for routine maintenance and refurbishment, which is carried out in the museum's own shops.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>carousel</b> was {{commissioned}} by William Hubbs, who had it installed in White City Amusement Park in 1917. Built on a Mangel-Illions mechanism, it used animals carved by the Dentzel carousel company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, sometime before 1900. <b>The</b> <b>carousel</b> was assembled by the William F. Mangels carousel company in 1917. It was probably not the first carousel in the park, as there are indications of a previous ride that came from Hartford, Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|The park {{district}} {{does not}} appear to have moved <b>the</b> <b>carousel</b> after taking over in 1945, as a 1955 newspaper article noted it was still in the same spot it had occupied for 38years. <b>The</b> <b>carousel</b> was again operated as a concession within the park, this time by the wife of Everett DuBois, the park superintendent. Like Hubbs, Mrs. DuBois operated <b>the</b> <b>carousel</b> for almost 10years. Although the district did not change the ride's location, it noted in 1955 that the equipment was showing its age. In 1955 the park district attempted to paint over the oil paintings on the canopy, which had deteriorated. The Indianapolis Art League objected, and volunteered to restore the original paintings rather than have them painted over with Disney characters.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>carousels</b> housed within <b>the</b> {{walls of}} this {{building}} are <b>the</b> 1913 <b>Carousel,</b> <b>The</b> Liberty <b>Carousel,</b> and <b>the</b> primitive <b>carousel.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> two {{predecessor}} <b>carousels</b> were <b>the</b> Feltman’s <b>Carousel</b> (1903) and <b>the</b> Stubbman <b>Carousel</b> (1908), both {{of which}} were created for amusement operators in Coney Island. 47 horses and the frame are from <b>the</b> Stubbman <b>Carousel,</b> and 24 horses are from <b>the</b> Feltman’s <b>Carousel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some of <b>the</b> <b>carousel's</b> {{horses are}} not {{actually}} horses, but {{are listed as}} such {{for the purpose of}} creating a list on <b>the</b> <b>carousel's</b> horses.

5|$|While {{plans were}} {{under way to}} secure funding for the {{restoration}} of <b>the</b> <b>carousel,</b> efforts were made to find some missing animals. By studying old photographs of <b>the</b> <b>carousel,</b> it was determined there had been three deer or stags which had not been found in the park district storage building. No one at the park district knew of their whereabouts, and some employees believed the animals had disintegrated. As well as the missing deer, two horses were missing. The museum contacted local newspapers, which published stories on the efforts to restore <b>the</b> <b>carousel.</b> The reports mentioned the missing animals, and that the museum was trying to locate them. An anonymous tip received in December 1973 revealed the deer were used in the annual Christmas Gift and Hobby Show, where they served as escorts for Santa Claus. Compton was able to secure the animals from the park district for the museum.|$|E

5|$|In 1965 The Children's Museum of Indianapolis, then {{located in}} a {{building}} at 30th and Meridian Streets, acquired two horses from <b>the</b> <b>carousel.</b> Mildred Compton, the museum director, had seen <b>the</b> <b>carousel</b> in Broad Ripple Park before 1952, and hoped to secure the surviving animals, but the park district was initially unwilling to part with more than two, as the district was using five or six animals in the annual Christmas displays at Monument Circle. During {{the first half of}} 1966, the two horses were refinished by a museum volunteer. Both were stripped of old paint, one was repainted, and the other was refinished with lemon oil to feature the carvings on the animal. Compton obtained real horse tails from an Indianapolis slaughterhouse to replace the lost originals. By September 1966 the two horses were ready for display in the museum's front entrance.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to those previously mentioned, the film also featured Dan Haggerty, who starred in the television series, The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams.

5|$|Cedar Point {{used to have}} {{a fourth}} {{carousel}} located in Frontiertown, next to the Wave Swinger. It was known as the Frontier Carousel or William H. Dentzel 1921 Carousel. It opened at Cedar Point in 1972 when it was bought from a family in Lansing, Michigan. It was listed on the NRHP on November 8, 1990. After the 1994 season, <b>the</b> <b>carousel</b> closed and was moved to Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, where it operates under the name Antique Carousel. Its building is currently used for the HalloWeekends attraction, Eternity Infirmary.|$|E

Pyramid Head is also seen controlling <b>the</b> <b>carousel</b> where Heather and Alessa face off against each other, then it kills the cult leader Claudia Wolf after the amulet shows her inner, monstrous nature.|$|E
5|$|Lost Luggage is {{an action}} {{game in which}} the player {{controls}} skycap porters who are attempting to collect falling luggage from a wildly unpredictable baggage carousel. The objective is to collect all the suitcases that fall from <b>the</b> <b>carousel</b> before they hit the ground. The player starts with three suitcases, which act as lives, and whenever a suitcase hits the floor, the player loses one. If all of the player's suitcases are lost, the game ends.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, the Merrie England bar and an {{amusement}} arcade were constructed {{at the end}} of the pier nearest to the shore. The 1939 theatre, which is still in use, narrowly escaped damage in 1985 when the early stages of a fire were noticed by performer Vince Hill. In the 1980s, a Victorian-styled entrance was built. In 1991 the pier gained <b>the</b> <b>Carousel</b> bar as an additional attraction, and a small tramway to ease access to the pier-head. By this point, the pier had ceased to have any nautical use, but the jetty section was adapted for use as a helicopter pad in the late 1980s. The Christmas Eve storm of 1997 destroyed the landing jetty, including the helipad.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>carousel</b> {{is one of}} {{the three}} oldest {{surviving}} Dentzel menagerie carousels. Thirty-one of its 42wood-carved animals are horses, 17 standing and 14 jumping. There are also three goats, three giraffes, three deer, one lion, and one tiger. The single lion and tiger are typical of Dentzel-created carousels, as are the three giraffes; Gustav Dentzel's love of that animal resulted in all of his carousels including at least one row of giraffes. The animals are arranged in three circles around the central mechanism, alternating leaping or jumping horses with stationary animals. Typical for a Mangels-Illions manufactured carousel, there are 18jumping animals, all but one of which is original; the horse that could not be found in 1975 was replaced with another Dentzel horse. Although the animals were not originally carved to display jewels, at some point they were so displayed at the amusement park, and thus the museum restored the animals on the outside circle with jewels.|$|E
25|$|After reconstruction, {{the western}} part of the park opened in late summer 2011 with new park plantings, {{improved}} lighting, and the restored, 1922-era Jane's Carousel, purchased from Idora Park, Youngstown and housed in an all-weather acrylic and steel pavilion designed by French architect Jean Nouvel, which opened September 15, 2011. <b>The</b> <b>carousel</b> and its pavilion are the gift of David and Jane Walentas to Brooklyn Bridge Park. <b>The</b> <b>carousel</b> pavilion was designed by architect Jean Nouvel and commissioned by Walentas to allow <b>the</b> <b>carousel</b> to operate year-round. <b>The</b> <b>carousel</b> is maintained and operated by Friends of Jane's Carousel, a not-for-profit entity, guaranteeing the carousel's upkeep for up to thirty years.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{concept of}} <b>carouseling</b> an IMU is {{simulated}} {{in order to}} improve the accuracy of MEMS IMUs. Carouseling consists of slewing the IMU through a pre-determined trajectory that is selected based on inherent properties that lead to improved performance. MEMS devices typically have far more uncertainty than standard inertial measurement devices, yet are considerably less massive and require less power, so implementing this carouseling scheme could make the use of these lightweight systems possible even in high-accuracy situations, such as gyrocompassing. In gyrocompassing, the most significant benefit provided by <b>the</b> <b>carouseling</b> scheme is <b>the</b> reduction in the error contribution of gyroscope bias, as this error is almost completely eliminated. Additionally, it was found that although implementing <b>the</b> <b>carouseling</b> scheme required <b>the</b> addition of error states to account for the size effect, in many cases these error states may not be necessary. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>carouseling</b> of <b>the</b> MEMS IMUs was shown to be effective in reducing azimuth error covariance significantly. by Benjamin Matthew Renkoski. Thesis (S. M.)

5|$|The museum {{intended}} to keep {{a few of the}} animals and sell the others to finance its operations, but Mildred Compton returned from a visit to <b>the</b> 1973 National <b>Carousel</b> Roundtable convinced that it should instead restore all of them and recreate <b>the</b> working <b>carousel</b> in its planned new building. But no space had been allocated to allow the display of such a large exhibit, requiring the plans to be adjusted. Columns required in the original layout were removed to allow <b>the</b> <b>carousel's</b> installation on <b>the</b> fifth floor.|$|R

25|$|An ornate {{carousel}} {{displaying a}} bestiary {{is housed in}} a circular building near the children's playground. <b>The</b> <b>carousel</b> was built in 1914 by the Herschell-Spillman Company. The building was occupied by three previous carousels before the current attraction was purchased by Herbert Fleishhacker from the Golden Gate International Exposition in 1941. The 1914 carousel has undergone several major renovations, the first, a transition from steam to electric power {{with the assistance of}} the PG Company. In 1977 <b>the</b> <b>carousel</b> closed for safety concerns and The San Francisco Arts Commission hired local artist Ruby Newman to oversee the artistic restoration. Her crew of craftspeople restored the badly deteriorated carousel and she hand painted all animals, chariots, and decorative housing (she holds the copyright). <b>The</b> <b>carousel</b> was re-opened in 1984. Presently, <b>the</b> <b>carousel</b> includes sixty two animals, a German Band Organ, and painted landscapes of the bay area by Ruby Newman. Two of the animals, a goat and an outside stander horse, are by the Dentzel Wooden Carousel Company.|$|E
