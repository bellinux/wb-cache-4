5|$|By 1909 {{the school}} library had 6,000 books valued at $3,500 and Ray D. Fisher was librarian. During November of that year the library {{received}} new furniture as Eaton Hall opened, and many departments were moved to it from Waller Hall. The library was re-cataloged in 1912 by Lucia Haley, a specialist from New York City hired by the school for this task. At that time <b>the</b> <b>librarian</b> was Dr. Lyle. Plans at this time called for constructing a building where the Art Building now stands {{to serve as a}} memorial to the pioneers of the university. This was to be the future home of the library, but the building was never built. In 1913, <b>the</b> <b>librarian</b> was Mary Field, and the collection was still about 6,000 volumes.

Chief and Cortana {{recommend}} attacking the Didact {{while he is}} vulnerable, but Infinity captain Del Rio orders them to destroy the gravity well so their ship can escape. In the process, Chief is contacted by a Forerunner known as the Librarian—the wife of the Didact, as well as ancient humanity's protector. She explains that the Forerunners were divided {{on how best to}} combat the Flood. After failing to discover a way to immunize biological beings from the parasite, the Didact used a device called the Composer to convert the warriors under his command into mechanical Promethean Knights immune to infection. Requiring more soldiers, the Didact forcibly converted captured humans into Prometheans, before being stopped and imprisoned by <b>the</b> <b>Librarian.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Librarian,</b> who has guided humanity's development, accelerates the Chief's evolution; this grants him immunity to the Composer.|$|E

While in the university library he meets a young, dark-haired woman reading a copy of Bram Stoker's Dracula. She is Helen Rossi, the daughter of Bartholomew Rossi, and she has become an expert on Dracula. Paul attempts to convince her that one of the librarians is trying to prevent their research into Dracula, but she is unpersuaded. Later, <b>the</b> <b>librarian</b> attacks and bites Helen. Paul intervenes and overpowers him, but he wriggles free. <b>The</b> <b>librarian</b> is then run over by a car in front of the library and apparently killed.|$|E

5|$|To {{support the}} household, in late 1874 Coolbrith took a {{position}} as <b>the</b> <b>librarian</b> for the Oakland Library Association, a subscription library that had been established five years earlier. In 1878, the library was reformed as the Oakland Free Library, the second public library created in California under the Rogers Free Library Act (Eureka was first). Coolbrith earned a salary of $80 per month, much less than a man would have received. She worked 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. Her poetry suffered as a result. She published only sporadically over the next 19 years—working as Oakland's librarian was the low point of her poetic career.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the public}} nature of <b>the</b> library <b>the</b> <b>librarians</b> meet members from the entire society in one room daily and {{need to address the}} {{different}} needs of the patrons and the patrons' different expectations of the librarians' service. The aim of the thesis is to investigate public librarians' encounters with patrons, that <b>the</b> <b>librarians</b> perceive as difficult or challenging. Socially excluded groups like homeless individuals, drug users or mentally ill individuals are groups that together with teenagers can be perceived as "problem patrons". To investigate this problem six interviews with <b>librarians</b> were conducted. <b>The</b> analytical framework concists of Echeverris definition of a good reception of users, <b>the</b> <b>librarians</b> ethical guidelines and on Jürgen Habermas theory of the public sphere. <b>The</b> <b>librarians</b> perception of <b>the</b> public library and their own reception of the library patrons appeared to be very similar to the theoretical framework.

Thorne escapes captivity outside 'Mdama's base, and escapes with Glassman; they are rescued by Majestic Squad.|$|E

They escape through the same portal as the Halos but lose power and drift for an unknown amount of time before being recovered by Lifeworkers. The portal has carried them to the Ark, the massive structure that serves as a construction site for Halos and also a haven for the Librarian's work. The trio are healed, and Bornstellar meets <b>the</b> <b>Librarian,</b> which brings up conflicting thoughts and feelings, due to his imprint from the Didact. She informs him that the Master Builder executed the Didact soon after Bornstellar was sent back to his family. With the news that the Didact is gone, Bornstellar resolves to take his place. The book ends with a narration from the Didact/Bornstellar, revealing that the escaped prisoner was the last Precursor, known as Timeless One. Through a conversation the Didact had long ago, it is learned that the Precursors created the Forerunners, only for the Forerunners to rise up and eradicate the Precursors, except this one, who now seeks revenge.|$|E
