2500|$|Higher {{than the}} event in 1852 by several feet, this flood {{affected}} the whole length of the C Canal. [...] Since Conococheague and Antietam Creeks were flooding as well, the worst damage was done {{to the middle of}} the canal. [...] Damage totaled US$200,000 (1877 dollars). [...] Navigation could not resume until the following April. [...] A result of this flood was a telephone network being installed along the canal, which was, [...] at the time, the longest <b>telephone</b> <b>circuit</b> in the world.|$|E
2500|$|On March 10, 1891, Almon Brown Strowger, an {{undertaker}} in Kansas City, Missouri, patented the stepping switch, {{a device}} {{which led to}} the automation of <b>telephone</b> <b>circuit</b> switching. While there were many extensions and adaptations of this initial patent, the one best known consists of 10 levels or banks, each having 10 contacts arranged in a semicircle. When used with a rotary telephone dial, each pair of digits caused the shaft of the central contact [...] "hand" [...] of the stepping switch to first step (ratchet) up one level for each pulse in the first digit and then to swing horizontally in a contact row with one small rotation for each pulse in the next digit.|$|E
2500|$|Port-side torpedo {{damage caused}} rapid {{compartment}} flooding; prompt counter-flooding by four damage-control parties {{under the command}} of Lt. Commander John S. Harper and early closure of all water-tight doors and hatches ordered by Harper's assistant, Archie P. Kelley, prevented the ship from capsizing. Water damage ruined much of the ship's communications gear, including its battle-phone batteries. An experimental sound-powered <b>telephone</b> <b>circuit</b> connecting the central station with the damage-control parties, tested during the previous summer's damage-control drills, remained operative but was unused. Captain Mervyn S. Bennion, unaware that Harper and Kelly had begun damage-control efforts, ordered Lieutenant C. V. Ricketts to begin counter-flooding the starboard compartments. Ricketts, delayed at his battle station and AA-gun batteries, arrived to find 30 to 40 starboard compartments already flooded. In his report, Ricketts wrote that he witnessed the flooding of one compartment. He then ordered all remaining starboard compartments flooded and returned to the bridge to help move the captain, mortally wounded by shrapnel. Harper's report on the counter-flooding of [...] "all available voids", as directed, indicated that Ricketts' assistance had been unnecessary.|$|E

50|$|The {{properties}} of these signals differ between countries, but they typically have a frequency of 50 Hz, 12 kHz or 16 kHz, and a duration of several tens {{or hundreds of}} milliseconds. 50 Hz pulses are applied to the <b>telephone</b> <b>circuit</b> as common-mode signals, with respect to ground, as applying them differentially would allow the talking parties to hear 50 Hz buzz tones. These pulses are applied at relatively high voltage to distinguish them from 50 Hz power-mains-induced signals. 12- and 16 kHz metering pulses are applied differentially across the <b>telephone</b> <b>circuit,</b> as these frequencies cannot be heard by listeners with conventional telephone instruments.|$|E
