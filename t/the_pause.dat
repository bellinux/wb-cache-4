5|$|Combat in {{the game}} is similar to its predecessor, with the main series of {{missions}} beginning after an opening tutorial. The game features ground-based hack-and-slash gameplay and aerial combat. In ground combat, the player controls multiple characters, switching between them via <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> menu {{in order to use}} their different weapons. The characters use physical attacks using character weapons for short-range battle, while magical attacks are used for long-range attacks and groups of enemies. The magical attacks vary between the playable characters. Weapons, characters and magical abilities leave up and grow stronger as the player gains experience points in combat: weapons have a four-level cap.|$|E
5|$|The European Community {{attempted}} to provide humanitarian {{aid to the}} 12,000 civilians trapped within the perimeter, but only one aid convoy made it through. On 12 October, the Croatians suspended military action to allow the convoy to pass, but the JNA used <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> as cover to make further military gains. Once the convoy set off, the JNA delayed it for two days and used the time to lay mines, bring in reinforcements and consolidate JNA control of the road out of Vukovar. When the convoy arrived, it delivered medical supplies to Vukovar's hospital and evacuated 114 wounded civilians.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts is {{influenced}} by its parent franchise, Final Fantasy, and carries gameplay elements over into its own action-based, hack and slash system. The main battle party consists of three characters: Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy. Sora is directly controlled by the player from a third person camera angle. All other party members are computer-controlled, though the player can customize their behavior to an extent through <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> menu. Donald and Goofy comprise the party in most areas, but nearly every level features a character who may replace them. For instance, Jack Skellington can join Sora's party in Halloween Town, but cannot accompany the player elsewhere. In some worlds, the party changes its appearance, has abilities unique to that world or both, can fly in Neverland, acquire aquatic forms in Atlantica which enable them to survive underwater, and gain Halloween costumes in Halloween Town {{to blend in with}} the locals.|$|E

5000|$|A {{sentence}} like (1) {{will not}} typically be produced with <b>the</b> <b>pauses</b> indicated in (2), where <b>the</b> <b>pauses</b> [...] "interrupt" [...] syntactic constituents. For example, <b>pausing</b> between <b>the</b> and dog would interrupt the noun phrase (DP) constituent, as would pausing between his and hand. Most often, pauses are placed {{so as to}} group the utterance into chunks that correspond to the beginnings and ends of constituents such as noun phrases (DPs), verb phrases (VPs), and prepositional phrases (PPs). As a result, sentences like (3), where <b>the</b> <b>pauses</b> correspond to syntactic constituents, are much more natural.|$|R

Seven EPs were found also for the Italian alphabet. However in a second experiment the majority of subjects scanned the Italian alphabet with the same preferred rhythmical recitation, <b>the</b> <b>pauses</b> of which correspond to the EPs. These results suggest that the interpretation of EPs as entities should be cautious...|$|R
5|$|Several {{changes have}} been made to the {{gameplay}} mechanics for Guitar Hero II: hammer-on and pull-off functionality has been improved, and three note chords have been introduced, scored as triple points if played correctly. There are additional statistics available for a song upon completion, and the scores achieved in either Quick Play or Career mode are saved to the same in-game high-score list. The handedness of the guitar can now be toggled from <b>the</b> <b>Pause</b> menu when playing a song (previously, this was only available from the game's main menu). For the Xbox 360 version, scores can also be compared with other players through Xbox Live via the Leaderboard feature, and there are 50 Achievements that can be earned in the game.|$|E
5|$|The HVO {{advanced}} north along {{two main}} axes of attack. The western axis advanced from Šuica {{along the main}} road towards Kupres, capturing the village of Donji Malovan on 1 November. The eastern axis of the HVO offensive moved from Ravno towards Rilić. Just as the HVO began to move north, the ARBiH suspended its westward advance. Various explanations for <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> were put forward, including fog, rain, need to secure territorial gains, wear of equipment and fatigue of personnel. Regardless, that day the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija Izetbegović telephoned Alagić requesting an adequate level of cooperation and avoidance of any conflicts with the HVO. Finally, Alagić made a public call to the HVO {{to participate in the}} offensive against the VRS in Kupres. The same day, the VRS targeted Bugojno using two 9K52 Luna-M missiles.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{consisted}} of about forty missionaries, {{some of whom}} were monks. Soon after leaving Rome, the missionaries halted, daunted {{by the nature of the}} task before them. They sent Augustine back to Rome to request papal permission to return, which Gregory refused, and instead sending Augustine back with letters to encourage the missionaries to persevere. Another reason for <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> may have been the receipt of news of the death of King Childebert II, who had been expected to help the missionaries; Augustine may have returned to Rome to secure new instructions and letters of introduction, as well as to update Gregory on the new political situation in Gaul. Most likely, they halted in the Rhone valley. Gregory also took the opportunity to name Augustine as abbot of the mission. Augustine then returned to the rest of the missionaries, with new instructions, probably including orders to seek consecration as a bishop on the Continent if the conditions in Kent warranted it.|$|E

5|$|Each of the game's worlds feature eight main levels, with a boss {{appearing}} {{at the end}} of every fourth and eighth level. Hidden throughout each of these levels are five Flowers and twenty Red Coins, the latter of which are hidden behind specific coins in each level. Collecting Flowers adds flowers to the gate {{at the end of}} each level (not including boss levels). If the player manages to land on an open flower after jumping through the end gate, they can play a bonus game during which they can earn extra lives or bonus items that can be activated from <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> menu, such as additional stars or maginifying glasses that reveal the location of hidden Red Coins. At the end of each level, players receive a score based on how many Flowers and Red Coins they found, as well as how many stars they have remaining, with a maximum score of 100 awarded for finding all Flowers and Red Coins and ending the level with 30 stars. Completing all levels in a world with a score of 100 unlocks two additional levels for that world.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, signed in 1939, Nazi Germany began Operation Barbarossa—the {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union—on 22 June 1941. Initially the Luftwaffe was at an advantage, destroying thousands of Soviet aircraft {{in the first month}} of fighting. Hitler and his top staff were sure that the campaign would be over by Christmas, and no provisions were made for reserves of men or equipment. But, by July, the Germans had only 1,000 planes remaining in operation, and their troop losses were over 213,000 men. The choice was made to concentrate the attack on only one part of the vast front; efforts would be directed at capturing Moscow. After the long, but successful, Battle of Smolensk, Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily diverted its Panzer groups north and south to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev. <b>The</b> <b>pause</b> provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilize fresh reserves; historian Russel Stolfi considers it {{to be one of the}} major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 with the Battle of Moscow. Poor weather conditions, fuel shortages, a delay in building aircraft bases in Eastern Europe, and overstretched supply lines were also factors. Hitler did not give permission for even a partial retreat until mid-January 1942; by this time the losses were comparable to those of the French invasion of Russia in 1812.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the last}} match of the Série A before the FIFA World Cup, {{stopping}} the league in the seventh round and Palmeiras in the mid-table position. During <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> for the World Cup, Jorge Parraga, the team's interim manager was replaced by Luiz Felipe Scolari, who previously managed Palmeiras from 1997 to 2000, winning the Copa do Brasil and the Libertadores. Scolari agreed to manage the team even with proposal from other four Brazilian clubs.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>pause</b> {{between the}} offensives {{was used for}} {{bringing}} in additional forces by both sides. On February 24 (Estonian Independence Day), fulfilling their first task at the Narva Front, the fresh SS Volunteer Grenadier Regiments 45 and 46 (1st and 2nd Estonian) counterattacked to break the Soviet bridgeheads. The assault by the 2nd Estonian Regiment destroyed the Soviet Riigiküla bridgehead. The attack of the 1st and 2nd Estonian Regiments commanded by Standartenführer Paul Vent liquidated the Siivertsi Bridgehead by March 6.|$|E
25|$|As {{opposed to}} most other turn-based systems where the player {{controls}} the individual actions of every party member, in LMBS, the player only directly controls one main character. Other {{characters in the}} party can be set to passive mode (defend only), active mode and attack (computer controlled), or the player can often force the characters to move or use a spell from <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> menu. For the titles that allow multiplayer, the other party characters can be controlled by other human players.|$|E

40|$|F 1 -ATPase is a {{rotary motor}} enzyme {{in which a}} single ATP {{molecule}} drives a 120 ° rotation of the central γ subunit relative to the surrounding α 3 β 3 ring. Here, we show that the rotation of F 1 -ATPase spontaneously lapses into long (≈ 30 s) pauses during steady-state catalysis. The effects of ADP-Mg and mutation on <b>the</b> <b>pauses,</b> as well as kinetic comparison with bulk-phase catalysis, strongly indicate that <b>the</b> <b>paused</b> enzyme corresponds to the inactive state of F 1 -ATPase previously known as the ADP-Mg inhibited form in which F 1 -ATPase fails to release ADP-Mg from catalytic sites. <b>The</b> <b>pausing</b> position of <b>the</b> γ subunit deviates from the ATP-waiting position and is most likely the recently found intermediate 90 ° position...|$|R

It was then found that the road on the far side was impassable, so a bypass was made, allowing them to move to an area near Arafagan Creek, {{on the banks of the}} Ramu River. Under Frazier's supervision, the 2/27th established an airstrip nearby. An air supply drop was made there on the afternoon of 2 October.|$|E

During the match, the wrestler performed significantly against the young Gracie, but the latter kept dominating, evidencing a training specialized to counter Sakuraba's style. There was controversy {{towards the end of the}} fight, as Sakuraba seemed to have secured a kimura, only to the referee to pause the match to pull up Ralek's pants. <b>The</b> <b>pause</b> allowed the Brazilian to come back with an armbar, which Kazushi escaped to meet a unanimous decision win for Gracie.|$|E
25|$|The second Turkish War (1787-92) and the Swedish {{war with}} Gustavus III (1788–90) heaped fresh burdens on his already heavily laden shoulders, and he {{suffered}} from the intrigues of his numerous jealous rivals, including the empress's latest favorite, A. M. Mamonov. All his efforts were directed towards {{the conclusion of the}} two oppressive wars by an honorable peace. <b>The</b> <b>pause</b> of Verela with Gustavus III (14 August 1790) was on the terms dictated by him. On the sudden death of Potemkin he was despatched to Jassy to prevent the peace congress there from breaking up, and succeeded, {{in the face of all}} but insuperable difficulties, in concluding a treaty exceedingly advantageous to Russia (9 January 1792). For this service he received the thanks of the empress, the ribbon of St Andrew and 50,000 roubles.|$|E

Magical Girl Miracle☆Monomi is a minigame in which players control Monomi fighting off against waves of cute monsters. Island Mode, which is available after clearing the game once, is an alternate mode where the students are not subjected to Monokuma's killing game and instead aim to make friends with each other and earn Hope Fragments. This allows players to bond with characters more easily than in the main story mode.

25|$|Abuses of the encomienda system, which reduced native {{population}} to near slaves, often led to grandiose projects, violating the mandate for modesty, with {{documents from the}} 1560s admonishing friars for their exploitation of native workers. Construction of the complex was halted in the 1570s and the precise reason is not known. Possibilities include the lack of funds, or that the complex had become so sumptuous that authorities stopped it. Another very likely reason was a dispute over who should continue paying for the construction. If a monastery was built on encomienda land, then the encomendero (in this case the Cortés family) would pay. If built on Crown lands (such as the city of Antequera) then the Crown was responsible. Disputes over the land led to dispute over who needed {{to pay for the}} construction of the monastery. Another possibility was the native population declined from about 43,000 in the 1520s to 7,000 in 1600, leaving no workers. <b>The</b> <b>pause</b> was initially meant to be temporary, but it became permanent.|$|E
25|$|The {{series was}} militaristic in nature, with each enemy sprite having a {{corresponding}} information section in <b>the</b> <b>pause</b> menu, relating {{details of the}} real world weapon (or a fictionalized version, in the case of non-existent weapons, such as the Mohican helicopter from Urban Strike). The next generation titles, Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike, featured plots based heavily on present day geopolitics, such as the instability of post-USSR states, or tensions at the DMZ between North and South Korea. However, in contrast, the games often displayed a quirky sense of humor, featuring numerous appearances by Elvis including outside a castle where he cannot be killed or even harmed, he just laughs at you and even Santa Claus, as well as wisecracks from the player character in the earlier games (in Urban Strike, the player's character, on being told the villain is an evil genius, comments: 'Great, another evil genius. Why can't I ever fight an evil idiot?') Although ostensibly serious in nature, the games were often quite tongue-in-cheek in their execution.|$|E
