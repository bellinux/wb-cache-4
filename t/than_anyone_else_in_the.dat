5|$|During 1948, Hutton scored heavily for Yorkshire. Despite missing {{more than}} half the County Championship matches, he scored more runs at a better average <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> side. In county matches, Hutton {{averaged}} 92.05 and scored eight centuries. Some Yorkshire critics expressed concern at the team's dependence on Hutton and the poor performance of other batsmen. Hutton's main challenge that season came from the Australian side which toured England undefeated and won the Test series 4–0. In {{the early part of the}} tour, the Australians, and particularly the pace bowlers Lindwall and Miller, tried to shake Hutton's confidence by targeting him. Although Hutton failed on a difficult pitch in Yorkshire's match against the tourists, he was the only successful batsman against them when he appeared for MCC shortly after.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{excitement}} surrounding King's performance, the Americans did not fare well overall, {{and the results}} may have been worse than hoped for by the tour's promoters. Philadelphia won only two of their fifteen matches, losing nine and earning a draw in the remaining four. After their win against Sussex, the only other win of the tour came against Warwickshire. During this match, King took 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scored 46 runs. According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, King proved himself {{to be the best}} bowler on the American side and had to do much of the work. He bowled three hundred overs, more <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team, taking 72 wickets with a bowling average of a little over 24 runs. In addition to his bowling, King scored 441 runs as a batsman at a batting average of just over 20.|$|E
5|$|During the 2009–10 season, Rolle started 33 games, in 24 {{of which}} he scored in double figures and in 11 {{of which he}} had double-doubles. He {{rejected}} more shots <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> WAC, averaging 2.1 blocks per game, and finished fourth in career blocked shots at Louisiana Tech despite playing there for only two seasons. Rolle also posted averages of 8.4 rebounds per game, third in the WAC (behind Luke Babbitt of Nevada and Chis Oakes of San Jose State), and 13.9 points per game, 12th in the WAC. His field goal percentage was 51.1, tied with Babbitt for third in conference and behind Tai Wesley of Utah State and Ike Okoye of Boise State. At the conclusion of the season, Rolle was named to the Lefty Driesell All-America Defensive Team, All-WAC Defensive Team, All-WAC Second Team, and All-Louisiana Second Team. He graduated from Louisiana Tech with a bachelor's degree in sociology in March 2010, becoming the first person in his family to earn a degree.|$|E

5|$|They realise {{that this}} was a trap {{arranged}} by Kovarian, as the Silence begin to escape confinement and overload the eyedrives (including Madame Kovarian's), killing their users. The Doctor and River escape {{to the top of the}} pyramid while Amy and Rory fight off a wave of Silence and Amy realises who Rory is. Madame Kovarian dislodges her own eyedrive as it begins to overload, but Amy forces it back in place with the intention of killing her as revenge for Kovarian taking her child (Melody Pond) away. Amy and Rory regroup with River and the Doctor. River tries to convince the Doctor that this frozen timeline is acceptable and that he does not have to die, but the Doctor explains that all of reality will soon break down. River claims she'll suffer more <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe if she has to kill the Doctor, despite his horror at the idea. To stop it, the Doctor marries River on the spot and whispers something in her ear, declaring that he had just told her his name. He then requests that River allow him to prevent the universe's destruction. The two kiss, and reality begins to return to normal.|$|E

25|$|Hawley began {{teaching}} at the University of Arizona in 1929. By 1933, the University of Arizona was faced with financial difficulties due to the Great Depression, and they asked most of the young faculty to take a year’s leave of absence, which included Hawley. In the fall of 1934, she took a job {{teaching at the}} University of New Mexico in the Department of Anthropology where she made less than the male professors. As a professor Hawley was not considered easy; she expected her students to learn and to think on their own. She taught over 20 courses, several of which were usually taught by men. She was found at one point to be teaching more courses <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anthropology department. Hawley always brought new theoretical approaches {{as well as her}} own ideas into focus while teaching.

500|$|She then landed {{her first}} major film role as Stephanie Zinone in Grease 2 (1982), {{the sequel to}} the smash-hit musical Grease (1978). The film was a {{critical}} and commercial failure, and Pfeiffer's single release of [...] "Cool Rider" [...] from the film's soundtrack on PolyGram failed to dent the music charts. Nevertheless, Pfeiffer received some positive attention for her performance, notably from The New York Times, which said [...] "although she is a relative screen newcomer, Miss Pfeiffer manages to look much more insouciant and comfortable <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cast".

[...] In the three years that followed, Sagan traveled throughout the American West, founding 75 more AI chapters. By 1978, AI USA's membership had increased to 70,000, more than 100 times that of a decade before.

500|$|According to {{contemporary}} sportswriter Grantland Rice, only two sports {{figures of the}} 1920s approached Ruth in popularity—boxer Jack Dempsey and racehorse Man o' War. One {{of the factors that}} contributed to Ruth's broad appeal was the uncertainty about his family and early life. Ruth appeared to exemplify the American success story, that even an uneducated, unsophisticated youth, without any family wealth or connections, can do something better <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. Montville noted that [...] "the fog [...] will make him forever accessible, universal. He will be the patron saint of American possibility." [...] Similarly, the fact that Ruth played in the pre-television era, when a relatively small portion of his fans had the opportunity to see him play allowed his legend to grow through word of mouth and the hyperbole of sports reporters. Reisler noted that recent sluggers who surpassed Ruth's 60-home run mark, such as Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds, generated much less excitement than when Ruth repeatedly broke the single-season home run record in the 1920s. Ruth dominated a relatively small sports world, while Americans of the present era have many sports available to watch.|$|E
500|$|Lynette Porter, in {{her book}} Tarnished Heroes, Charming Villains and Modern Monsters: Science Fiction in Shades of Gray on 21st Century Television {{observed}} that Rose's role [...] "humanizes the Doctor and makes him less alien, not only to other characters, but to the audience". In the first series finale, Rose takes on deadly energies to save the Doctor and planet Earth. Script editor Helen Raynor felt the episode gave Rose a chance to [...] "again be the Doctor’s equal" [...] and [...] "to finally match him with a gesture that is so noble, and strong, and heroic, and clever". Davies describes Rose {{in the context of}} this scene, and the whole of the first series, as being [...] "braver than brave and more loyal <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe". The Doctor repays her loyalty by sacrificing his ninth incarnation in turn to save her; Davies states unequivocally that [...] "he gives his life for her". Elements of Rose's characterisation in the first series were originally different. Paul Abbott was scheduled to write an episode which would have revealed that Rose's entire life had been manipulated by the Doctor in order to mould her into an ideal companion. Davies wrote the episode [...] "Boom Town" [...] to replace it when Abbott realised he was too busy to work on the script.|$|E

500|$|DeHavilland {{made her}} screen debut in Reinhardt's A Midsummer Night's Dream, which was filmed at Warner Bros. studios from December 19, 1934 to March 9, 1935. During the production, deHavilland picked up film acting {{techniques}} from the film's co-director William Dieterle, and camera techniques from cinematographer Hal Mohr, who {{was impressed with}} her questions about his work. By the end of filming, she had learned the effect of lighting and camera angles on how she appeared on screen and how to find her best lighting. Following premieres in New York and Beverly Hills, the film was released on October 30, 1935. Despite the publicity campaign, the film generated little enthusiasm with audiences. While the critical response was mixed, deHavilland's performance was praised by The San Francisco Examiner critic. In his review in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Winston Burdett noted that she [...] "acts graciously and does greater justice to Shakespeare's language <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cast". Two minor comedies followed, Alibi Ike with Joe E. Brown and The Irish in Us with James Cagney. In both films, she played the sweet and charming love interesta role into which she would later become typecast. After {{the experience of being}} a Reinhardt player, deHavilland felt disappointed being assigned these routine heroine roles. In March, deHavilland and her mother moved into an apartment at the Chateau des Fleurs at 6626 Franklin Avenue in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|The 1933 season signalled {{a return}} to form for Macaulay. Wisden judged that he [...] "recovered fully his length, spin and command over {{variations}} in pace". He bowled more overs <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team and passed 100 wickets {{for the first time}} since 1929, the tenth and final time he did so, taking 148 wickets at an average of 16.45. Against Northamptonshire, he took seven for nine as the team was bowled out for 27. He finished the match with thirteen for 34. Against Lancashire, when his match figures were twelve for 49, he took a hat-trick in a sequence of four wickets in five balls; he also took twelve wickets against Leicestershire. His form won a recall to the Test side after seven years. Not picked initially, a decision described by Wisden as unfair, he played in the first Test when E. W. Clark dropped out of the team before the match. Macaulay took one wicket in the first innings but had figures of four for 57 in the second innings to earn approval from Wisden. He was picked for the second Test but bowled only 14 overs before injuring his foot when fielding; he was unable to take any further part in the game. He did not play in the third Test but was selected in festival game at Scarborough for the team selected from the MCC party which toured Australia in the previous winter. He played instead of an injured player, even though he did not take part in the tour. Macaulay ended second in the Yorkshire bowling averages. In its review of the season, Wisden stated that his form in the early part of the season would have placed his among the best cricketers in the world.|$|E
500|$|In 1906, Hirst {{completed}} an unprecedented double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. Cricket writer A. A. Thomson noted that both milestones were unusual individually, {{and that such}} all-round achievements had only been matched in scope by those of W. G. Grace in the 1870s. No other cricketer has come close to matching this particular double. Hirst reached the 1,000 run–100 wicket double {{by the end of}} June, two weeks faster <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of first-class cricket. In total he scored 2,385 first-class runs at an average of 45.86 and took 208 wickets at 16.50. Hirst's contributions were particularly important in a close race for the County Championship. Kent were eventual champions after Yorkshire lost a close game to Gloucestershire, but Hirst performed well in the two matches against Kent. He scored a century and took 11 wickets as Yorkshire won the first, and took eight wickets and scored a match-saving 93 in the drawn second encounter. Against the other title contenders, Lancashire and Surrey, he was likewise successful with both bat and ball, earning praise from The Times and Wisden for his batting under difficult circumstances in these matches. His captain, Lord Hawke, said [...] "It was not only what Georgie Hirst did but how he did it, coming off [...] when an effort seemed most necessary and playing his best against the more formidable sides." [...] He scored six centuries, two of which came in a record-equalling performance against Somerset. He scored 111 and 117 not out when batting and took six for 70 and five for 45 with the ball. He became only the second man after Bernard Bosanquet to score two centuries and take 10 wickets in the same first-class match; as of 2015, only one other man, Franklyn Stephenson in 1988, has achieved the feat. Battling a knee injury and exhaustion {{towards the end of the}} season, it became increasingly difficult for Hirst to perform. Hirst took his 200th wicket at the end of August and commented that, were his feat to be duplicated in future, [...] "whoever does will be very tired". He also commented that his injuries only troubled him once the season was over and it [...] "was a triumph of spirit over matter".|$|E
