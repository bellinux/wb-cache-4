5|$|One of {{the private}} {{investigators}} was David Edgar, a retired detective inspector, hired {{on the recommendation of}} the head of Manchester's Serious Crime Squad. Edgar released an e-fit in August 2009 of a woman said to have asked two British men in Barcelona, Spain, shortly after the disappearance, whether <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> deliver her new daughter. Other private initiatives included a Portuguese lawyer financing the search of a reservoir near Praia da Luz in February 2008, and the use of ground radar by a South African property developer, Stephen Birch, who said in 2012 that scans showed there were bones beneath the driveway of a house in Praia da Luz.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} plan included coordinated strikes on Axis airfields {{carried out by}} Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress groups to tie down Axis fighter groups. Medium bomber units operating the North American B-25 Mitchell would fly sweeps over the Gulf of Tunis. They were {{to be joined by}} Lockheed P-38 Lightning heavy fighters which were also detailed to sweep the area. The presence of the B-25s would allow the P-38s to operate in the area without raising the Axis suspicions. It would seem as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> escort the B-25s, rather than their actual intention, to interdict Axis air transports. Supermarine Spitfire units would sweep the straits further north, catching any enemy aircraft that evaded the P-38s. More B-25 and B-17 units were detailed to strike at Sicilian airfields to catch transports on the ground. The USAAF 9th Air Force was detailed to send its Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomb groups against airfields in and around Naples in this capacity as well. On 2 April Doolittle's superiors, supreme commander of all Allied Air Forces in the Mediterranean, Arthur Tedder and commander of Allied Air Forces in Western North Arica Carl Spaatz, decided to wait for the next suitable window to launch the offensive.|$|E
25|$|King George VI and Queen Elizabeth {{visited the}} city by train on 12 June 1939. Over 100,000 people were {{estimated}} {{to be in the}} crowd that greeted them. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> build goodwill for the British Empire before they confronted Nazi Germany and the Axis Powers during World War II.|$|E

50|$|Elsewhere, the Prise pay a {{visit to}} rebel leader Mariah Antillarea. The reason for this meeting is not {{immediately}} clear; it's possible that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> warn her of the dragonflies destined for Paris: Earth.|$|R
25|$|Just as {{different}} experts were respected equally, all Korean gods were equally respected in their fields. Koreans viewed all gods as equal because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> solve problems in people’s lives. Therefore, {{in order to}} better understand Korean oral myths, it is important to set the types of problems that may occur in everyday living situations.|$|E
25|$|Four pan-blue legislators {{attempted}} {{to enter the}} Hsieh election headquarters without permission, with the reason that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> investigate {{the claim that the}} government provided them office space for free. Hsieh's supporters surrounded them and blocked them as they tried to leave; fighting broke out. The pan-green called it an illegal search and said the pan-blue camp will carry out further similar actions if they controlled both the executive and legislature.|$|E
25|$|After getting Nick's model Viking {{ship from}} the hotel, they drive around a route {{provided}} by Sandspur {{of where the}} giants are, playing the mermaids' song. The giants follow the sound to the sea, where Nick drops the little boat (with the tape recorder) into the ocean. The giants follow it out to sea and the kids {{go back to the}} hotel where they find the Grace kids waiting for them with the news that the giants woke up {{all at the same time}} because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> kill something even worse.|$|E
50|$|In a {{flashback}} to an undetermined previous time, two Marines {{go to her}} house. Although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no sound in this scene, it’s obvious <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> tell her that Rusty died in the war. She lashes out at them, and the movie ends.|$|R
50|$|Molly and Susie are rescued in {{the nick}} of time by Kunjachan, who {{consoles}} Molly after her near-rape by Jimmy. The next morning, Kunjachan is visited at his institute by the Brothers.

25|$|Throughout 1999, {{the members}} {{gradually}} turned on one another. Initially, Chyna turned on Triple H {{and joined the}} Corporation on January 25. At WrestleMania XV Chyna turned on then fellow Corporation member Kane, helping Triple H to defeat him. Later that night, Triple H and Chyna interfered in X-Pac's European Championship match with Shane McMahon. Initially, it appeared <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> help X-Pac, but Triple H quickly turned on him, delivering a Pedigree to his former stablemate, costing him the match. Chyna and Triple H would then join The Corporation, with Kane being ousted. As a result, X-Pac began to share a bond with Kane, which resulted in Kane becoming associated with the faction and the duo holding the WWF Tag Team Championship twice.|$|E
25|$|On April 3, 1882, {{after eating}} breakfast, the Fords and Jameses {{went into the}} living room before {{traveling}} to Platte City for a robbery. From the newspaper, James had just learned that gang member Dick Liddil had confessed to participating in Wood Hite's murder. He was suspicious that the Fords had not told him about it. Robert Ford later said he believed that James had realized <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> betray him. Instead of confronting them, James walked across the living room and laid his revolvers on a sofa. He turned around and noticed a dusty picture above the mantle, and stood on a chair to clean it. Robert Ford drew his weapon, and shot the unarmed Jesse James {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2001, Campbell's {{contract}} expired. Mindful of the Bosman ruling and what happened with Steve McManaman (Britain's first high-profile Bosman related transfer), Tottenham offered him a contract which would have made him the club's highest-ever paid player, but after months of negotiations and several public assurances he would stay at Spurs, Campbell stated his need to leave the club in order to play UEFA Champions League football, {{with the likes of}} England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson advising him of such a course. Several top continental clubs expressed interest in signing him, but he joined Arsenal— Tottenham's biggest rivals— on a free transfer. Campbell had previously stated in an interview with Spurs Monthly magazine that he would never play for Arsenal. The move was also unusual as no rumours of a move to Arsenal had been leaked or speculated upon in the media before the press conference revealing his decision, and many journalists in attendance had been led to believe <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> witness the unveiling of goalkeeper Richard Wright, which would have been a routine sports news story.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} {{places them}} in a bomb shelter and explains the group that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> solve the world's problems in one night; {{if they fail to}} gather a thousand points before morning, the terrorist will detonate the hidden nuclear device planted {{in the basement of the}} 'genius lair'.|$|R
50|$|Shipwreck {{is one of}} {{the first}} Joes called back to active duty, and {{is one of the}} few Joes {{unaffected}} by Cobra's nanite-based weapons. As such, he is one of the many on-foot military defenders on the White House lawn; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> stop a Cobra takeover. Despite losses, including Greenshirts, Cobra is defeated.|$|R
50|$|Below those Board Members are Ministers, who {{function}} as spiritual guides. Since {{many of the}} practices of the church <b>are</b> risky, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> make sure people stay safe. According to the Code of Ethics, “Spiritual guides are to practice and serve in ways that cultivate awareness, empathy, and wisdom.” To become a minister, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an application.|$|R
25|$|The Polish–Prussian {{alliance}} angered Catherine II, who recalled von Stackelberg {{and replaced}} him with Yakov Bulgakov. This, however, changed little: Russia was still occupied with the Ottomans, and the Prussians played their own game, further giving Catherine a pause before ordering any intervention. Bulgakov was further outmaneuvered by the Polish reformers when King Stanisław August drew closer to {{leaders of the}} reform-minded Patriotic Party (Stanisław Małachowski, Ignacy Potocki, Hugo Kołłątaj, Stanisław Staszic and others). Finally the reformers pulled a quasi-coup d'etat, voting for a new constitution, the Constitution of May 3, 1791, {{when most of the}} pro-Russian deputies (Muscovite Party) were away for the Easter recess. The Constitution which drastically reformed the Commonwealth coincided {{with the end of the}} Russo-Turkish war. The members of the Muscovite Party, who felt secure with the previous status quo and under Russian protection, formed the Targowica Confederation, and requested Catherine II to intervene to restore their freedoms. A month after the Constitution was signed Bulgakov informed the Polish king that Russian forces were responding to their request and entering Poland in order to 'restore order' - although in fact <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> abolish the constitution which threatened the Russian control over Poland. The Prussians were also appalled at the possibility of strong constitutional monarchy at their border. Poland forces, numerically inferior to Russians (at about 1:3), were eventually defeated in the War in Defense of the Constitution. The Constitution was abolished, and the Second Partition of Poland took place.|$|E
25|$|On February 9, the NLD {{released}} {{a statement saying that}} Thein Lwin, a member of NNER, was suspended from his position in the party’s central executive committee indefinitely. Another statement released by the NLD also announced the suspension of its Central Education Committee chaired by Thein Lwin. Aung San Su Kyi, the leader of the NLD, also said that it was a conflict of interest for a party member to be involved in an organization independent of the party. Thein Lwin responded by saying that he believed “student demands are righteous”. The statement came out as Thein Lwin along with other education advocates and student representatives attended the third quadripartite meeting with Deputy Minister of Education and reached an agreement to resume further talks on February 11 at Yangon Region Parliamentary building. At the same time, the students marching from Mandalay were approaching Pyay in Bago Region and were about a mile away from a barricade set up by 200 riot police and 100 Swan Arr Shin members. About 300 residents from nearby towns accompanied the students to protect them due to rumors of a possible crackdown. Meanwhile, the students marching from Tanintharyi Region arrived in Mawlamyine, the capital of Mon State the day before and held several demonstrations joined by the locals (thein lwin suspended). The third group leaving from Ayeyarwady Region reportedly arrived in Maubin, about 100 miles away from Yangon. In Dedaye, in the northwest of Maubin and about 56 miles from Yangon, around 400 riot police were deployed. The student protesters called for negotiations with the police in case of a potential confrontation and the police informed that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> provide security not to stop the protests. Moreover, the fourth group of around 300 students left Pakokku, following the path that the group from Mandalay took several weeks ago.|$|E
500|$|In a {{day where}} {{half of the}} week's top-10 teams were defeated, USC escaped {{becoming}} the sixth in a messy, mistake-prone 27–24 victory in a wet, windy game in Seattle. [...] Although USC had a 460–190 edge in total yards, their errors helped the Huskies significantly: They committed threeturnovers and 16penalties—their most in more than twoseasons—for 161yards, missed a field goal and had a punt blocked. [...] A disappointed Pete Carroll noted [...] "We just couldn't do more things wrong in the game [...] I thought Washington was there for it. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> take it. All they needed was onemore chance." ...|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{at least}} since the 1990s, the schools of the Special Group of Rio and São Paulo parade usually with three or four pairs of mestre-salas and porta-bandeira, but only the first is evaluated, the other being merely decorative, and optional. Normally, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> {{represent}} the school in some events when the main couple is unable to.|$|R

After beating the rebels, the Flock proceed to do volunteer work, such as distributing rice.|$|R
40|$|I {{have written}} {{earlier in this}} column affirming that in Hong Kong <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{separation}} of powers among the executive, the judiciary, and the legislative functions. Given that separation of powers is alive and well, legislators certainly are not accountable to the executive branch. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> accountable to Hong Kong people at large and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> offer constructive criticisms and advice to the SAR government. Legislators thus <b>are</b> not <b>there</b> <b>to</b> rubber stamp everything proposed by the executive. Today, legislators are all either popularly elected or elected by their functional constituencies. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> guard and to further {{the interests of the}} public. Even legislators from functional constituencies should be accountable to the public. Ideally, their functional constituency background should enrich discussions in the Legislative Council, so that such discussions will not lose sight of some important perspectives. Being accountable to people who voted them into office would be too narrow a perspective...|$|R
500|$|Testing on [...] "Project Commando Lava" [...] {{began on}} 17 May. Scientists from Dow Chemical {{had created a}} {{concoction}} that, when mixed with rainwater, destabilized the materials that made up soil and created mud. There was enthusiasm from the military and civilian participants in the program, who claimed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> [...] "make mud, not war." [...] In some areas it worked, depending on {{the makeup of the}} soil. The first mission was flown from Udorn Royal Thai Air Base by three C-130A aircraft from the 41st Tactical Airlift Squadron, Naha Air Base, Okinawa, Japan.|$|E
500|$|The play's protagonist {{and lead}} female role is the defendant, Karen Andre. Woods {{considered}} several actresses for the role, but with Rand's support he cast an unusual choice, an actress named Doris Nolan. It was Nolan's Broadway debut; her previous professional acting experience was a failed attempt at completing a movie scene. At 17 years old, she was {{cast as a}} presumably older femme fatale. Woods was Nolan's manager and got a commission from her contract. Nolan was inexperienced and was nervous throughout rehearsals. When other actresses visited, she feared <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> replace her. Although Rand later said she was [...] "not a sensational actress", reviewers praised her performance. Nolan left the cast in March to take a movie contract from Universal Studios.|$|E
500|$|During this tour, Bryan spoke almost {{exclusively}} on the silver question, and attempted to mold the speeches to reflect local issues and interests. [...] He did not campaign on Sundays, but on most other days spoke between 20 and 30 times. [...] Crowds assembled hours or days ahead of Bryan's arrival. [...] The train bearing The Idler pulled in after a short journey from the last stop, and after he was greeted by local dignitaries, Bryan would give a brief speech addressing silver {{and the need for}} the people to retake the government. [...] The shortness of the speech did not dismay the crowds, who knew his arguments well: <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> see and hear William Jennings Bryan—one listener told him that he had read every one of his speeches, and had ridden [...] to hear him, [...] "And, by gum, if I wasn't a Republican, I'd vote for you." [...] After a brief interval for handshakes, the train would pull out again, to another town down the track.|$|E
50|$|Being {{prepared}} for disasters {{is yet another}} important role for social workers. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> help lessen {{the harmful effects of}} disasters. All communities should be {{prepared for}} natural disasters because nobody is immune to them. Social workers can help communities be prepared by emphasizing community collaboration and coordination of social networks to make a comprehensive plan before a disaster strikes.|$|R
50|$|Robots are {{segmented}} spherical {{creatures with}} mechanical arms and either wheels or helicopter rotors. Found {{mostly on the}} Planet of Technology, like all robots, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> linear thinkers attempting <b>to</b> multitask. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> help but do not always take instructions well.

500|$|The {{crowd was}} larger than {{anticipated}} and spanned {{the entire length of}} the [...] Burnside Bridge. Belville had initially expected [...] "between 50 and 5,000 people", but details of the event spread online and through word of mouth, and ultimately it was estimated that [...] "thousands" [...] had turned out. Some attendees said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> commemorate an historic moment, while others admitted having come for free marijuana and cannabis seeds. One man, known as [...] "Pork Chop" [...] (or [...] "Porkchop"), reportedly announced over a megaphone that he had 420 pounds of marijuana to distribute, though his claim was not supported by news outlets. Two women with Ideal Farms, who wished to [...] "share the love", distributed joints to attendees who could prove that they were of legal age. One man distributed drops of hash oil, and Belville himself shared an ounce of marijuana (the maximum allowed under Oregon Ballot Measure 91). Some participants did receive free marijuana, seeds, and/or starter plants, but many did not, due to the larger than expected crowd. Coupons were also distributed for later redemption.|$|E
500|$|Racial {{segregation}} in South Africa had begun {{with the arrival}} of Dutch colonists in South Africa in 1652, and continued through centuries of British rule thereafter. Racial separation increased greatly after the British took complete control over South Africa in the late 19th century, and passed a number of laws early in the 1900s to separate racial groups. The 1923 [...] Natives (Urban Areas) Act forced black South Africans to leave cities unless <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> work for white people, and excluded them from any role in the government. The system of apartheid was implemented by the Afrikaner National Party (NP) after they were voted into power in 1948, and remained in place for 46 years. The white minority held all political power during this time. [...] "Apartheid" [...] meant [...] "separateness" [...] in the Afrikaans language, and involved a brutal system of racial segregation. Black South Africans were compelled to live in poor townships, and were denied basic human rights, {{based on the idea that}} South Africa belonged to white people. A prominent figure in the implementation of the apartheid laws was Hendrik Verwoerd, who was first Minister for Native Affairs and later Prime Minister in the NP government.|$|E
500|$|Diệm later implicated two Americans, George Carver and Russ Miller for {{involvement}} in the plot. Both had spent the coup attempt with the rebel officers. Durbrow had sent them there {{to keep track of}} the situation, but Diệm felt that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> encourage the uprising; the coup group's desired changes were very similar to those advocated by Durbrow in previous months. It was later revealed that Carver had friendly relations with the coup leaders and then arranged for Thuy to be evacuated from South Vietnam when the loyalists overwhelmed the paratroopers. Carver had also spent some of the coup period in a meeting with civilian rebel leaders at Thuy's house, although it is not known if he pro-actively encouraged Diệm opponents. The Ngô brothers indicated to the Americans that Carver should be deported, and soon after, Carver received a death warrant. The threat was supposedly signed by the coup leaders, who were ostensibly angry because Carver had abandoned them and withdrawn American support for them. The Americans thought that Nhu was the real culprit, but told the Ngô family that they were removing Carver from the country for his own safety, thereby allowing all parties to avoid embarrassment. Years later, Carver said he agreed with the rebels' thinking that Diệm was doing poorly and needed to be replaced, saying he was [...] "absolutely convinced" [...] that a regime change was needed to [...] "achieve American objective in Vietnam". In his memoir, Don claimed Miller had cryptically encouraged him to overthrow Diệm a few months before the coup attempt.|$|E
50|$|Each of {{the three}} {{movements}} is named for a place in New England. Each is intended to make the listener experience the unique atmosphere of the place, as though <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there.</b> <b>To</b> that end, Ives’ paraphrasing of American folk tunes is a particularly important device, providing the listener with tangible reference points.

The swords could also mean that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> help the person cut through their own difficulties.|$|R
50|$|Justice Stewart {{agreed with}} the Majority's {{decision}} to overturn the District Court's injunction because {{he felt it was}} overly broad.
