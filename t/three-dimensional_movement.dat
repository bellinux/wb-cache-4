5|$|Many {{performances}} {{deal with}} behaviors {{that occur in}} daily life. However, {{in accordance with the}} overriding principle of beauty, such behaviors are stylized to be presented on stage. Peking opera does not aim to accurately represent reality. Experts of the art form contrast the principles of Peking opera with the principle of Mo, mimes or imitation, that is found in western dramas. Peking opera should be suggestive, not imitative. The literal aspects of scenes are removed or stylized to better represent intangible emotions and characters. The most common stylization method in Peking opera is roundness. Every motion and pose is carefully manipulated to avoid sharp angles and straight lines. A character looking upon an object above them will sweep their eyes in a circular motion from low to high before landing on the object. Similarly, a character will sweep their hand in an arc from left to right in order to indicate an object on the right. This avoidance of sharp angles extends to <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>movement</b> as well; reversals of orientation often {{take the form of a}} smooth, S-shaped curve. All of these general principles of aesthetics are present within other performance elements as well.|$|E
25|$|Schneider et al. {{also studied}} {{the effects of}} {{combining}} music therapy with standard motor rehabilitation methods. In this experiment, researchers recruited stroke patients without prior musical experience and trained half of them in an intensive step by step training program that occurred fifteen times over three weeks, in addition to traditional treatment. These participants were trained to use both fine and gross motor movements by learning {{how to use the}} piano and drums. The other half of the patients received only traditional treatment {{over the course of the}} three weeks. <b>Three-dimensional</b> <b>movement</b> analysis and clinical motor tests showed participants who received the additional music therapy had significantly better speed, precision, and smoothness of movement as compared to the control subjects. Participants who received music therapy also showed a significant improvement in every-day motor activities as compared to the control group. Wilson, Parsons, & Reutens looked at the effect of melodic intonation therapy (MIT) on speech production in a male singer with severe Broca's aphasia. In this study, thirty novel phrases were taught in three conditions: unrehearsed, rehearsed verbal production (repetition), or rehearsed verbal production with melody (MIT). Results showed that phrases taught in the MIT condition had superior production, and that compared to rehearsal, effects of MIT lasted longer.|$|E

This is the first successful in vivo recording of the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>movements</b> of human vocal folds in absolute values. Triangulation images of the vocal folds are recorded at the rate of 4000 fps with a resolution of 256 X 256 pixels.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to show that {{planning}} and controlling the trajectory of a pointing movement is influenced not solely by physical constraints but also by visual constraints. Subjects were required to point towards different targets located at 20 ◦, 40 ◦, 60 ◦ and 80 ◦ of eccentricity. Movements were either constrained (i. e. two-dimensional movements) or unconstrained (i. e. <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>movements).</b> Furthermore, movements were carried out either under a direct or a remote visual control (use of a video system). Results revealed that trajectories of constrained movements were nearly straight whatever the eccentricity of the target and the type of visual control. A different patternwas revealed for unconstrained movements. Indeed, under direct vision the trajectory curvature increased as the eccentricity augmented, whereas under indirect vision, trajectories remained nearly straight whatever the eccentricity of the target. Thus, movements controlled through a remote visual feedback appear to be planned in extrinsic space as constrained movements...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding how animals {{respond to}} {{atmospheric}} conditions across space {{is critical for}} understanding the evolution of flight strategies and long-distance migrations. We studied the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>movements</b> and energetics of great frigate birds (Fregata minor) and showed that they can stay aloft for months during transoceanic flights. To do this, birds track {{the edge of the}} doldrums to take advantage of favorable winds and strong convection. Locally, they use a roller-coaster flight, relying on thermals and wind to soar within a 50 - to 600 -meter altitude band under cumulus clouds and then glide over kilometers at low energy costs. To deal with the local scarcity of clouds and gain longer gliding distances, birds regularly soar inside cumulus clouds to use their strong updraft, and they can reach altitudes of 4000 meters, where freezing conditions occur...|$|R

50|$|Digital {{microfluidics}} (DMF), {{has already}} been readily adapted in many biological fields. By enabling <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>movement</b> within DMF, the technology can be used even more extensively in biological applications, as it could more accurately mimic 3-D microenvironments.. A large benefit of employing this type of method is that that it allows for two different environments to be accessible by the droplet, which can be taken advantage of by splitting the microfluidic tasks among the two surfaces. For example, while the lower plane {{can be used to}} move droplets, the upper plate can carry out the necessary chemical and/or biological processes. This advantage can be translated into practical experiment protocols in the biological community, such as coupling with DNA amplification. This also allows for the chip to be smaller, and to give researchers more freedom in designing platforms for microdroplet analysis.|$|E

40|$|A wagon–track {{dynamics}} {{interaction model}} has been developed to investigate the dynamics of suspensions with friction wedge dampers that are widely used in three-piece bogie wagons in Australia. The wagon is modelled using 66 degrees-of-freedom, accounting for the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>movements</b> of all wagon components. The mass of the wedge has also been modelled. The track is modelled with rails as Timoshenko beams and discretely supported by the spring and damper elements representing the elasticity of pads, fasteners, and ballast.

The simulation results of the wagon–track dynamics interaction model have been compared with those from a VAMPIRE model.

40|$|Present smart phones contain {{high-tech}} {{sensors to}} monitor <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>movements</b> {{of the device}} and users' behaviours.

Also, the created gesture sets were generated from people who do not have to use their motion gestures very much in their daily lives, not from people with communication difficulties. To address this issue, we use a focus group that has dyslexia and other specific learning difficulties for designing the user-defined gesture sets. This paper presents the results of our study that elicits the focus group's gestures to invoke commands on a smart-phone device. It demonstrates how the gesture sets have been designed and finalised throughout other research activities, such as observation and interviews.

40|$|Sleep is a {{behavior}} that is found in all animals that have a nervous system and that have been studied carefully. In Caenorhabditis elegans larvae, sleep {{is associated with a}} turning behavior, called flipping, in which animals rotate 180 {degree sign} about their longitudinal axis. However, the molecular and neural substrates of this enigmatic behavior are not known. Here, we identified the conserved NK- 2 homeobox gene ceh- 24 to be crucially required for flipping. ceh- 24 is required for the formation of processes and for cholinergic function of sublateral motor neurons, which separately innervate the four body muscle quadrants. Knockdown of cholinergic function in a subset of these sublateral neurons, the SIAs, abolishes flipping. The SIAs depolarize during flipping and their optogenetic activation induces flipping in a fraction of events. Thus, we identified the sublateral SIA neurons to control the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>movements</b> of flipping. These neurons may also control other types of motion...|$|R
