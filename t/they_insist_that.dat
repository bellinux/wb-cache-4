5|$|The {{difference}} of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement {{for the establishment of}} an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order. The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. <b>They</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.|$|E
5|$|The CCP {{views the}} world as {{organized}} into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. <b>They</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> socialism, {{on the basis of}} historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Despite admitting that globalization developed through the capitalist system, the party's leaders and theorist argue that globalization is not intrinsically capitalist. The reason being that if globalization was purely capitalist, it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity. Globalization, as with the market economy, therefore does not have one specific class character (neither socialist nor capitalist) according to the party. The insistence that globalization is not fixed in nature comes from Deng's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism. Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CCP that despite the current capitalist dominance of globalization, globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism.|$|E
25|$|Strangites reject {{both the}} {{traditional}} Christian {{doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus Christ and the Mormon doctrine of plurality of gods. <b>They</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> there is but one eternal God, the Father, and that alleged progression to godhood (a doctrine supposedly taught by Smith; Strangites reject that assertion) is impossible. God has always been God, say they, and he is one Person (not three, as in the traditional Christian Trinity).|$|E

25|$|However, some researchers, such as ecology {{professor}} Tim Clutton-Brock, {{assert that}} cooperation {{is a more}} complex process. They state that helpers may receive more direct, and less indirect, gains from assisting others than is commonly reported. These gains include protection from predation and increased reproductive fitness. Furthermore, <b>they</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> cooperation may not solely be an interaction between two individuals but {{may be part of}} the broader goal of unifying populations.|$|E
25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) outlawed {{the use of}} {{fluorescein}} {{for this}} purpose, since it was shown to be harmful to the river. The parade committee has since switched to a mix involving forty pounds of powdered vegetable dye. Though the committee closely guards the exact formula, <b>they</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> it has been tested and verified safe for the environment. Furthermore, since the environmental organization Friends of the Chicago River believes the dye is probably not harmful, they do not oppose the practice.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{largely due}} to the efforts of the National Coalition for the Homeless (NCH) and {{academic}} researchers, the problem of violence against homeless people has gained national attention. In their report: Hate, Violence, and Death on Mainstreet USA, the NCH reported 386 violent acts committed against homeless persons over the period, among which 155 were lethal. The NCH called those acts hate crimes (they retain the definition of the American Congress). <b>They</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> so called bumfight videos disseminate hate against homeless people and dehumanize them.|$|E

25|$|A {{friend and}} romantic interest, Joanne Herring, {{encourages}} Charlie {{to do more}} to help the Afghan people, and persuades Charlie to visit the Pakistani leadership. The Pakistanis complain about the inadequate support of the U.S. to oppose the Soviet Union, and <b>they</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> Charlie visit a major Pakistan-based Afghan refugee camp. Charlie is deeply moved by their misery and determination to fight, but is frustrated by the regional CIA personnel's insistence on a low key approach against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Charlie returns home to lead an effort to substantially increase funding to the mujahideen.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of Areala {{has its roots}} in the , or the Fraternity of Our Lady, a traditionalist Catholic organization. In 1991, a chapter was established in New York City's East Harlem in order to found a soup kitchen. It was in New York that Sister Marie Chantel who had been a black belt in Judo learned Taekwondo under a Hell's Kitchen martial arts master. Her fellow nuns, including the Mother Superior, also learned self-defense hearing that the neighborhoods were dangerous, though <b>they</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> their martial arts training is mostly for sport and that they have had no problems with the surrounding neighborhoods. Their story was ultimately picked up and reported by The New York Times.|$|E
25|$|However, some Hindus {{believe that}} when the emanations of the Supreme Being are pratyaksha, or obvious to the sight, they become sacara, or embodied. Krishna was such an {{embodiment}} and usually bore a human form. In that mode of appearance the deities are generally supposed to be born of a woman, but without any carnal intercourse. This belief is not adhered to by those who follow the Purva Mimansa, or the philosophy of Jaimini. <b>They</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> the Devas were mere mortals whom the Supreme Being endowed with qualities similar to his own. In general, the Hindus perform acts of worship to some of their ancient monarchs and sages, who were deified on account of their eminent virtues.|$|E

50|$|The {{prosecutors}} demanded {{capital punishment}} {{for all the}} defendants in the closing argument on 20 January 2009. <b>They</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the court sentence Kawagishi to death despite his voluntary surrender because he was unrepentant and the police {{would have been able}} to arrest the three without his surrender.|$|R
25|$|According to Michael Lynk, {{there are}} three schools of thought {{concerning}} the proper legal interpretation of the withdrawal phrase. Some of the parties involved {{have suggested that the}} indefinite language is a “perceptible loophole”, that authorizes “territorial revision” for Israel’s benefit. Some have stated that the indefinite language was used to permit insubstantial and mutually beneficial alterations to the 1949 armistices lines, but that unilateral annexation of the captured territory was never authorized. Other parties have said that no final settlement obtained through force or the threat of force could be considered valid. <b>They</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> the Security Council cannot create loopholes in peremptory norms of international law or the UN Charter, and that any use of indefinite language has to be interpreted in line with the overriding legal principles regarding the “inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war” and the prohibitions on mass deportations or displacement in connection with the settlement of the refugee problem.|$|E
25|$|The CPC don't {{believe that}} they have {{abandoned}} Marxism. The party views the world as organized into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. <b>They</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> socialism, on the basis of historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Marx wrote that capitalists, in their search for profit, would travel the world in a bid to establish new international markets – hence, it is generally assumed that Marx forecasted globalization. His writings on the subject is used to justify the CPC's market reforms, since nations, according to Marx, have little choice in the matter of joining or not. Opting not to take part in capitalist globalization means losing out in the fields of economic development, technological development, foreign investment and world trade. This view is strengthened by the economic failures of the Soviet Union and of China under Mao.|$|E
500|$|<b>They</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> {{the best}} way of {{learning}} is teaching and encouraging others, with the books prescribed by Tabligi Jamaat Movement in the light of Quran and Hadith stories of Prophets, Sahaba (Companions of Prophet) and Awlia Allah ("Friends of Allah"). [...] Even though there are publications associated with the movement, particularly by Zakariya Kandahalwi, the emphasis has never been on book learning, but rather on first-hand personal communication. A collection of books, usually referred as TablighiNisaab (Tablighi Curriculum), is recommended by Tabligh Jamaat elders for general reading. This set includes four books namely (Hayatus Sahabah, Fazail-e-Amaal, Fazail-e-Sadqaat and Muntakhab Ahadith).|$|E
25|$|The Seal Team Six hadn't yet {{surrounded}} {{the plane and}} soon found it surrounded by Italian military security (from the Italian Air Force and Carabinieri – the Military Police). <b>They</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Italy had territorial rights over the base and jurisdiction over the hijackers. A standoff between both armed forces began.|$|R

60|$|It {{was late}} ere he {{returned}} to Castle Skrae. There nothing of importance had occurred, except the arrival of more messages from the wireless machine. <b>They</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Miss Macrae was in perfect health, but implored the millionaire to settle instantly, lest anxiety for a father's grief should undermine her constitution.|$|R
500|$|Further {{conspiracy}} theories {{were reported in}} the 2006 non-fiction book The Sion Revelation: The Truth About the Guardians of Christ's Sacred Bloodline by Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince (authors of the 1997 non-fiction book The Templar Revelation, the principal source for Dan Brown's claims about hidden messages {{in the work of}} Leonardo da Vinci). They accepted that the pre-1956 history of the Priory of Sion was a hoax created by Plantard, and that his claim that he was a Merovingian dynast was a lie. However, <b>they</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> this was part of a complex red herring intended to distract the public from the hidden agenda of Plantard and his [...] "controllers". They argue that the Priory of Sion was a front organisation for one of the many crypto-political societies which have been plotting to create a [...] "United States of Europe" [...] in line with French occultist Alexandre Saint-Yves d'Alveydre's synarchist vision of an ideal form of government.|$|E
500|$|During Fellini's early film career, he {{was closely}} {{associated}} with the movement known as neorealism, a set of films produced by the Italian film industry during the post-World War II period, particularly 1945–1952, and characterized by close attention to social context, a sense of historical immediacy, political commitment to progressive social change, and an anti-Fascist ideology. [...] Although there were glimpses of certain lapses in neorealistic orthodoxy in some of his first films as a director, La Strada has been widely viewed as a definitive break with the ideological demands of neorealist theorists to follow a particular political slant or embody a specific [...] "realist" [...] style. [...] This resulted in certain critics vilifying Fellini for, as they saw it, reverting to prewar attitudes of individualism, mysticism and preoccupation with [...] "pure style". [...] Fellini vigorously responded to this criticism: [...] "Certain people still think neorealism is fit to show only certain kinds of reality, and <b>they</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> this is social reality. [...] It is a program, to show only certain aspects of life". [...] Film critic Millicent Marcus wrote that [...] "La Strada remains a film indifferent to the social and historical concerns of orthodox neorealism". Soon, other Italian filmmakers, including Michelangelo Antonioni and even Fellini's mentor and early collaborator Roberto Rossellini were to follow Fellini's lead and, in the words of critic Peter Bondanella, [...] "pass beyond a dogmatic approach to social reality, dealing poetically with other equally compelling personal or emotional problems". [...] As film scholar Mark Shiel has pointed out, when it won the first Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1957, La Strada became the first film to win international success {{as an example of a}} new brand of neorealism, [...] "bittersweet and self-conscious".|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Thorp {{wrote a book}} on {{entrepreneurship}} called [...] "Engines of Innovation". With his co-author Buck Goldstein, <b>they</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> the world's {{biggest problems}} can be solved through innovation at large research universities. They also created a website to encourage innovation on college campuses.|$|E

50|$|Maratha ministers {{realised}} {{that the}} Mughals would move on Vishalgad. <b>They</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Rajaram leave Vishalgad for Senji (Gingee) (in present Tamil Nadu), {{which had been}} captured by Shivaji during his southern conquests and was now {{to be the new}} Maratha capital. Rajaram travelled south under escort of Khando Ballal and his men.|$|R
50|$|Britain and France, however, {{were less}} idealistic. Ignoring {{the fact that}} they had agreed in 1938 to turn the European Commission of the Danube over to the river-bordering powers (headed by Nazi Germany), <b>they</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the Convention of 1921 was still in force and that their rights could not be {{abolished}} without their consent.|$|R
2500|$|Inherit the Wind, a play (later {{adapted to}} the screen) which is a broadly fictionalized account of the Scopes Trial. Though the authors note that the 1925 trial was [...] "clearly the genesis" [...] of their play, <b>they</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> the {{characters}} had [...] "life and language of their own." [...] They also mention that the issues raised in the play [...] "have acquired new dimension and meaning", a possible reference to the political controversies of the 1950s. Still, they finish their foreword by inviting a more universal reading of the play: [...] "It might have been yesterday. It could be tomorrow." [...] Spencer Tracy played the Darrow character ("Henry Drummond") in the film.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2013, Sheldrake gave {{a lecture}} at the Oxford Union {{outlining}} his claims, made in The Science Delusion, that modern science has become constrained by dogma. Sheldrake argued that these dogmatic constraints are particularly evident in physics. Despite the fact, he said, that scientists {{around the world}} consistently get different measurements for such [...] "constants" [...] as the gravitational force or the speed of light, <b>they</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> the variation is attributable to experimental error or they [...] "make up" [...] proportions of dark energy and matter, assuring that the variations they've observed {{can be made to}} fit into the established paradigm. [...] "What if the laws of nature vary throughout the day," [...] Sheldrake asked.|$|E
2500|$|They {{refuse to}} have a {{substitute}} guitarist playing late Minutemen guitarist D. Boon's parts; instead the songs are arranged for bass and drums. <b>They</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> they not be billed as Minutemen for these shows or {{referred to as a}} Minutemen reunion, as {{they do not want to}} cheapen or [...] "vampire" [...] the Minutemen name. Instead, they insist on being billed under their real names and that the advertisements state that they will be [...] "playing Minutemen songs as a duet." [...] They were chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform one of these shows at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that he curated in March 2012 in Minehead, England.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{injuries}} and the ineffectiveness of the Giants' outfielders, the team {{began to play}} Seymour in the outfield, though <b>they</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Seymour would not shift positions on a permanent basis.
