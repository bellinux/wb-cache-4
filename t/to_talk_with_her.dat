5|$|Imelda {{also managed}} to {{convince}} Fernando Lopez to accept the vice-presidential nomination along with presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos. She first invited Lopez to personally meet with her in his suite. Lopez accepted the invite but preferred <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> in her suite instead. To persuade Lopez, her methods include appealing to Lopez's sympathy by telling him the struggles that she and Ferdinand faced during the campaign for Ferdinand's nomination and how she feels being abandoned by Lopez. Lopez refused multiple times until Imelda cried in front of him. Imelda then proceeded to hand him and make him sign a document stating that he accepts the nomination as the Nacionalista vice-presidential candidate.|$|E
5|$|Angela and Serah {{then headed}} to Castle Caldecote in Cumberland {{as it was}} the {{whereabouts}} of the third Faustian. Her name was Anna Maria, the natural daughter of a bishop that was kept safe by Master Coulson in one of the castle's room as instructed by her father. However, in the last new moon, she managed to escape the castle and returned somewhat different. Seeing the girl was not mad as Coulson said she was, Serah demanded the girl to be freed from her chains and told Angela {{to keep an eye on}} her. As the days passed, Serah, who had been studying about the Faerie, discovered that the Enchantress sends a sliver of herself into each of those with whom she struck a deal and that she was using stories, such as that of her victims and Christopher Marlowe's play, to expand her power. Upon figuring it out, Serah started to devise a plan to counter that of Enchantress. Meanwhile, Angela struck a deal with Anna Maria: in exchange for a way to free her, she would tell Angela the truth about herself. The girl then told her she was born Witchbreed and that she eventually learned her touch was death. When the path to the Faerie was open, she took the opportunity to become something other than what she was, and willingly struck a deal with the Enchantress and became a Faustian. Later that night, Angela heard strange noises coming from Anna Maria's room and went to check if everything was right. There she found the girl crying, frightened by the Enchantress' voice inside her head. The girl asked Angela to tell her a story to calm her down, and so she did, but it was in vain as the Enchantress took control of the girl's body and attacked Angela. The girl managed to regain consciousness though and in an attempt to be free again, used Angela's weapon to kill herself. Serah showed up and was able to revive the girl, who was a Faustian no more. As she hadn't died, Serah thought she was safe from the Enchantress' wrath, but she was wrong as the Faerie rose from the blood of her lost Faustian and took Serah's life, fulfilling her menace. With the sun setting, Angela burned her lover's body to the ashes, recovering her skull and singing to it afterwards. Suddenly to Angela's surprise, the skull became animated and started <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

She vents her frustrations on her maid, Millie, and becomes suspicious of Griffin.|$|E

25|$|Bianca {{finds out}} that Reese was once engaged to a man and that she is Reese's first lesbian partner. She is hurt Reese did not tell her this.

500|$|Another {{girl who}} is {{connected}} to Yuichi's past is Mai Kawasumi who attends his high school as a third-year. She takes it upon herself to fight and defeat demons at night while the school is deserted.Translated quote: [...] "I'm a demon hunter." [...] Due to this, she is constantly blamed for accidents because she never denies them, being too sincere to say anything and knowing {{that no one will}} believe that there are demons in the school. Yuichi coincidentally meets a fifth girl named Shiori Misaka who he gets to know along with the other four heroines in the story. She has suffered from an unexplained affliction since birth which makes her weak to the point of missing school because of it. Yuichi starts <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> more after noticing her in the school courtyard one day. It turns out that Shiori stands outside on the school grounds nearly every day because she wants to meet someone dear to her.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{returned}} for the Glam-Punk {{segment of the}} show and strapped on a guitar for rocked-out versions of [...] "I Love New York" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". The backdrop during the performances displayed the New York skyline sliding off and stars respectively. [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was accompanied by her dancers in new wave style dance, while wearing black clothes and white ties. An energetic rendition of [...] "Let It Will Be" [...] followed before she sat down for some minutes <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> audience. She later started singing [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love" [...] without any choreography or backdrop video, only sitting on the floor, and then recalled co-singer Yitzhak Sinwani out for an acoustic version of [...] "Paradise (Not for Me)". The final segment Disco started after a brief radio-style mini-mix of old hits. Madonna emerged in a butterfly-collared suit influenced by John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever for a mash-up of [...] "Music" [...] and The Trammps' 1976 single [...] "Disco Inferno" [...] This also included a sample of her 1986 song [...] "Where's The Party" [...] {{at the beginning of}} the song while dancers rollerskated circles around her. Stuart Price's remixed dance version of [...] "Erotica", which sampled the song's original demo [...] "You Thrill Me", is performed. The next song was a Tropical-Dance version of [...] "La Isla Bonita", where the screens displayed clips of different beautiful islands, the sea and its fauna. This is followed by [...] "Lucky Star"; this dance re-invention of the song shared the same musical arrangement than the following and final song of the evening [...] "Hung Up", which is accompanied by a sing-along with the audience and confetti and golden balloons falling from above. The show ended as the phrase [...] "Have you confessed?" [...] appeared onscreen.|$|E

60|$|Gordon {{appeared}} <b>to</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> her; but {{he could}} think of nothing <b>to</b> say. <b>Talking</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> was a pretext for looking at her; and Bernard, who thought she had never been so handsome as at that particular moment, smiling at her troubled ex-lover, could easily conceive that his friend should desire to prolong this privilege.|$|R
60|$|In this {{condition}} of mind, {{it may be}} imagined, she did not do much studying or writing. She {{went to the library}} regularly, but she could not concentrate her thoughts upon her book.

2500|$|Kiki's loss of {{her ability}} to fly is also the subject of discussion. It is {{considered}} the worst crisis Kiki has to face during the film. [...] The loss of flight reflects the harm dealt to Kiki by her own self-doubts. However, this hardship is what causes Kiki to realize that being vulnerable does not always lead to failure. In essence, the experience demonstrates that such vulnerability can help one learn valuable lessons and better understand oneself. Kiki in fact does not face any external adversaries in the film, though {{some have argued that}} the crashing dirigible is a feasible example. Kiki also loses her ability <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> cat, Jiji.|$|E

As Babe and Zarf's relationship grows, they become closer and start working on the ConFusion campaign and after a strained talk with Bianca, an embarrassing over-the-top drag performance and an arrest by the Pine Valley Police Department, Zarf [...] "comes out" [...] to Babe and admits that he is transgender and that he is truly [...] "Zoe" [...] and a lesbian. Babe accepts her and it is exactly what Zoe needs. After this confession, their friendship continues to blossom.|$|E

60|$|For example, {{there can}} be no denying there was one Marjorie in the bundle who was immensely set up by {{the fact that she was}} engaged, and going to be at no very remote date {{mistress}} of a London house. She was profoundly Plessingtonian, and quite the vulgarest of the lot. The new status she had attained and the possibly beautiful house and the probably successful dinner-parties and the arrangements and the importance of such a life was the substance of this creature's thought. She designed some queenly dresses. This was the Marjorie most in evidence when it came <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> mother and Daphne. I am afraid she patronized Daphne, and ignored the fact that Daphne, who had begun with a resolute magnanimity, was becoming annoyed and resentful.|$|R

With some verbs the infinitive may carry a significantly different meaning from a gerund: compare I stopped <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> I stopped <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> or I forgot to buy the bread with I forgot buying the bread.|$|R

60|$|He took little Hetty's hand in his, {{and began}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> He did not allude {{to the subject}} which he knew was {{uppermost}} in her mind, except that by a more than ordinary gentleness and kindness he perhaps caused her to understand that her thoughts were known to him.|$|E

6000|$|But it was Raymond {{who made}} her uneasy--Raymond, who ever since his father's death {{had been more than}} all her other sons to her.

Had he not sat all the evening in his own place by her sofa, {{as if it were the}} very kernel of home and of repose? And {{whenever}} a sense of duty prompted her to suggest fetching his wife, had he not lingered, and gone on talking? It was indeed of Cecil; but how would she have liked his father, at the honeymoon's end, <b>to</b> prefer <b>talking</b> of <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> <b>her?</b> [...] "She has been most carefully brought up, and is very intelligent and industrious," [...] said Raymond.
