2500|$|The Janda {{report also}} finds Bill C-300 is {{consistent}} with the National Roundtables Advisory Group’s recommendations, with an even more modest set of proposals. However, this is based on examination of the 6 [...] "major components" [...] of the proposed Canadian CSR Framework, which is a central recommendation in the Advisory Group report, rather than the 26 specific recommendations contained in the Advisory Group report. [...] In fact, the Bill does not reflect any of the specific recommendations of the Roundtables, although it is frequently referenced to the Ombudsman called for in the Roundtable recommendations. [...] Supporters of C-300 state that the Bill is a better representation of the Obudsman than the recently created Office of the Extractive Sector CSR Counsellor, because C-300 can force investigations and impose [...] sanctions. [...] However, the Ombudsman office described in the recommendations was not to have the power to impose sanctions, it was proposed to “provide advisory, fact-finding and reporting functions”. [...] A separate [...] "standing <b>tripartite</b> Compliance <b>Review</b> Committee" [...] (presumably representing government, business, and civil society) was proposed that, in cases of serious non-compliance, would make recommendations with regard to the “withdrawal of financial and/or nonfinancial services” by the government.|$|R
40|$|Prior to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, {{criminal}} sentences {{were rarely}} appealed. For {{the first two}} years after implementation of the Guidelines, most appellate courts applied a <b>tripartite</b> standard of <b>review</b> when reviewing Guideline departures. Under this framework, courts reviewed the existence of an aggravating or mitigating factor de novo, the district court 2 ̆ 7 s actual findings for 2 ̆ 7 clear error, 2 ̆ 7 and the reasonableness of the extent of the departure for 2 ̆ 7 clear error. 2 ̆ 7 In Koon v. United States, the U. S. Supreme Court purportedly rejected this <b>tripartite</b> standard of <b>review,</b> and instead proclaimed a unitary 2 ̆ 7 abuse of discretion 2 ̆ 7 standard. On the tenth anniversary of the Guidelines, legal scholars continue to vigorously debate whether Koon restored or further reduced the district court judges 2 ̆ 7 sentencing discretion. Professor Lee presents both sides of this debate by analyzing and critiquing Koon, and ultimately proposes more simplified language to distinguish between the different standards of review. She starts by providing a historical overview of sentencing in the federal courts. She then discusses general principles of appellate review, providing a primer on standard of review jurisprudence for findings of facts, questions of law, mixed questions and discretionary decisions. Next, Professor Lee examines the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudence on appellate review of sentencing decisions under the Guidelines. Professor Lee proposes a reformulation of the Koon standard to reflect a sliding scale of deference approach which specifies varying degrees of deferential review for the different aspects of the departure decision. Lee applies this framework to Judge Davies 2 ̆ 7 decision to depart in the Koon case, and demonstrates how her reformulation provides better guidance to future appellate courts...|$|R
40|$|A widely {{discussed}} hypothesis in neuroscience is that transiently active ensembles of neurons, {{known as}} “cell assemblies,” underlie numerous {{operations of the}} brain, from encoding memories to reasoning. However, the mechanisms responsible for the formation and disbanding of cell assemblies and temporal evolution of cell assembly sequences are not well understood. I introduce and review three interconnected topics, which could facilitate progress in defining cell assemblies, identifying their neuronal organization, and revealing causal relationships between assembly organization and behavior. First, I hypothesize that cell assemblies are best understood {{in light of their}} output product, as detected by “reader-actuator” mechanisms. Second, I suggest that the hierarchical organization of cell assemblies may be regarded as a neural syntax. Third, constituents of the neural syntax are linked together by dynamically changing constellations of synaptic weights (“synapsembles”). The existing support for this <b>tripartite</b> framework is <b>reviewed</b> and strategies for experimental testing of its predictions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Real {{estate agency}} in Nigeria is confronted with various {{challenges}} that border on ethics and conduct in practice. This study assessed this situation by undertaking a <b>tripartite</b> <b>review</b> {{of the policy}} framework, pedagogy and practice of real estate agency. The position of policy on the practice of real estate agency was examined alongside pedagogic approach to training and issues of ethics in the practice. Questionnaires were used for data collection while relevant policy documents and extant literatures were also reviewed. Respondent groups include the thirty-five final year students of the Department of Estate Management Covenant University {{as well as the}} principal officers of fifty-two practicing Estate Firms in Ikeja, Lagos State, Nigeria. Data were analysed with 5 -Point Likert scale and mean score and subsequently ranked while Paired Sample T-Test was used to compare and establish if there is significant difference between the opinions of the study groups about the adequacy of real estate agency training in tertiary institutions. It was found among others that the pedagogic approach was inadequate in terms of period of delivery. It was also found that agency was not properly grafted into real estate profession while issues relating to ethics, misconduct and conflicts are rife among practitioners. In addition, it was found that institutions’ intervention mechanism in ethics and misconduct among practicing surveyors is weak and ineffective. The study therefore suggests improvement in pedagogic approach, amendment of existing policy to re-define and enshrine real estate agency in real estate profession thereby making it exclusive preserve of qualified practitioners. It also recommends empowering institutions’ intervention mechanisms for a more effective monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Good {{information}} and accurate agricultural statistics are {{a prerequisite for}} efficient and sustainable agricultural development. This project originated from the desire to maintain the 10 -yearly cycle of agricultural census taking in Nepal (the previous Censuses being in 1961 / 62, 1971 / 72 and 1981 / 82) {{and the need to}} establish an on- going system for the provision of current agricultural statistics. Project NEP/ 88 / 024 "National Sample Census of Agriculture 1991 / 92 " was signed by the Government on 13 February 1990, by FAO on 26 February 1990 and by UNDP on 1 March 1990. The project was scheduled to last for three years. A number of changes were made to the project design at the <b>Tripartite</b> <b>Review</b> meeting in April 1991, and the project was extended to June 1994. The development objective of the project was to provide reliable and comprehensive agricultural census data to facilitate planned development in the agriculture sector {{in order to meet the}} goals established in the development plans of the Government. The immediate objective of the project was to provide technical capability in terms of survey methodology, data processing and analysis within the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) to conduct a national agricultural census comprising 160 000 households by the end of 1992 and in future, to do similar sample censuses without recourse to external assistance. The project successfully met its objectives. The census was conducted on a sample basis using strict sampling principles and covered the whole of Nepal, including urban areas. Only the household sector was included, agricultural activities undertaken by government organizations, businesses, etc., were excluded. Also, farm households not meeting a minimum size criterion in terms of area of crops or number of animals were excluded from the census. Throughout the project, staff of CBS participated in the various phases of the census work and have been trained in all aspects of the design, data collection, processing and analysis of an agricultural census. The capability of CBS to undertake future agricultural censuses and surveys has been greatly enhanced by the project. In order not to loose the momentum generated by this project, a number of recommendations have been made in the report, which I should like to bring to your attention. It is recommended that CBS continue its programme on census analysis with initial emphasis given to the following areas:-preparation of a small handout for each district, showing highlights of the census;-provision of census tables in computer readable form as required by users; and-preparation of analytical reports on specific topics such as women in agriculture. It is also recommended that CBS develop a suitable policy to enable unit level data to be released, subject to necessary provisions to protect confidentiality...|$|E
40|$|Uganda last {{undertook}} a {{census of agriculture}} between 1963 - 1965 with assistance from FAO. A recommendation was subsequently made to conduct follow-up intercensal surveys and to carry out another detailed census after ten years. Until about 1975 some limited data collection in the agricultural sector was undertaken, but after that date this activity virtually came to a standstill due to the political instability prevailing in the country. In {{the absence of a}} proper mechanism for the collection, processing, analysis and dissemination of reliable statistical data, Uganda depended on a fragmentary reporting system to provide some estimates for planning purposes. However, these estimates were of doubtful reliability, and of very limited use for the proper planning of the agricultural sector. In 1984, the Government requested FAO/UNDP assistance in conducting a census of agriculture which would provide essential baseline data, as well as help to lay an infrastructural framework for a permanent system of food and agricultural statistics. A technical mission was fielded and a draft document for the preparatory project UGA/ 84 / 011 'National Agricultural Census (Preparatory Assistance) ', was formulated. The preparatory project UGA/ 84 / 011 was approved in February 1985 with the initial aim of formulating the main census project proposal. It commenced on 1 April 1987 as a one year preparatory assistance phase. This was extended by three months up to 30 June 1988. The main project document for UGA/ 88 / 002 'National Census of Agriculture and Livestock' was signed on 30 June 1988 with a duration of 33 months. A major revision was approved in May 1990 after an in-depth evaluation mission in January/February 1990. During this revision, the UNDP budget was increased and the project extended by 15 months up to 30 June 1992. Following the <b>Tripartite</b> <b>Review</b> Meeting held in October 1991, the budget was further increased and the duration further extended until 31 December 1992. Due to delays in the processing of the data and the production of the census reports, further extensions were agreed through 1993 and the project finally terminated on 31 December 1993. The overall development objective of the project was to contribute towards achieving and sustaining food self-sufficiency through sound plans and strategies in the agricultural sector. The immediate objectives of the project were:-to undertake, to the extent possible, a nationwide sample census of agriculture and livestock; and-to initiate a process for a permanent food and agricultural information system by: (i) the establishment of a data bank for storage and retrieval of data relating to the agricultural sector; and(ii) the preparation of an integrated programme of intercensal surveys and studies in the agricultural sector, including {{the first round of the}} current agricultural survey. While the first objective was to ensure that crucial baseline data was obtained through the conduct of an agricultural census, the other two objectives were to form the basis for establishing the infrastructural framework for a permanent system of food and agricultural statistics in Uganda. The project successfully met its objectives. The census was conducted on a sample basis in 26 of the 32 rural districts existing at the time. The remaining six districts could not be included due to the security situation. The data was processed and reports published. An annual Agriculture and Livestock Survey was designed and two rounds were conducted in 1991 / 92 and 1992 / 93 thus establishing the basis for a permanent food and agricultural information system. Training was considered to be an important activity in view of the project's institutional capacity building nature. Staff training at all levels was also necessary, due to the scale and complexity of the census and the fact that virtually none of the staff had any relevant experience. During the life of the project, a total of 40 work-months of fellowships and study tours were awarded to 13 different officers. A total of 19 work-months were devoted to overseas courses in data processing involving three statisticians, 15 work-months were devoted to post-graduate courses in statistics undertaken by three statisticians and six work- months were for study tours involving two national project directors and five other officers. Despite the initial problems faced in the course of project implementation, which led to delays, especially in data processing, analysis and report preparation, considerable success was achieved in organising and executing the census and providing the infrastructure required for a permanent system of agricultural statistics in Uganda. It is recommended that the capacity created be further strengthened and improved upon...|$|E
