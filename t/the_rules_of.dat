40|$|Talk of {{law reform}} {{is in the}} air {{throughout}} East Asia. Whether in Beijing or Tokyo or here, law reform is spoken of in terms <b>of</b> strengthening <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law. But what is <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law? Different legal systems have different roads to reach <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law. These different roads are noticeable mainly in the different emphases different systems place on two critical elements in <b>the</b> realization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law State, namely <b>rules</b> and <b>the</b> machinery for implementing <b>the</b> <b>rules,</b> i. e., courts and administrative agencies. <b>The</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law makes demands on both <b>the</b> legal <b>rules</b> themselves and on the institutions charged with implementing the law. Fulfillment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law requires both rules and institutions. But among those countries that have <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law, there are noticeable differences in how their rules and institutions contribute to fulfilling <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law. While there is considerable knowledge in Taiwan about western models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law, Taiwanese scholars who look abroad to consider <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law, should be aware of differences in how <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law is implemented among the countries they consider as models. The road to <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law is unique for each state. Thus, after exploring the experiences of the German, American and Japanese systems, Professor Maxeiner points out how infirmities in <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law necessarily cause you to have to choose among roads to <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law and to suggest how these choices may affect law reform. He would like to stress that these differences among legal methods demonstrate that there is no one right road to implement <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law. Taiwanese reformers should not seek for a preferred foreign choice, but to develop their own solution that works best for Taiwan...|$|R

40|$|Formal conceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law {{are popular}} among {{contemporary}} legal philosophers. Nonetheless, the coherence <b>of</b> accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law committed to these conceptions is sometimes fractured by elements harkening back to substantive conceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. I {{suggest that this}} may be because at its origins <b>the</b> ideal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law was substantive through and through. I also argue that those origins are older than is generally supposed. Most authors tend to trace <b>the</b> ideas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and natural law back to classical Greece, but I show that they are already recognisable and intertwined as far back as Homer. Because the founding moment of the tradition of western intellectual reflection on <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law placed concerns about substantive justice at <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law ideal, it may be hard for this ideal to entirely shrug off its substantive content. It may be undesirable, too, given the rhetorical power <b>of</b> appeals to <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law means something quite radical in Homer; this meaning may provide a source of normative inspiration for contemporary reflections about <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law...|$|R
40|$|This essay next makes {{three key}} {{observations}} concerning <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law: (1) <b>the</b> relationship between <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and human rights; (2) the interrelatedness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law {{to a local}} <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law; and (3) the insights <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law affords to {{the exploration of the}} nexus between trade and human rights. To conclude, this piece suggests a holistic approach to <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. Such a model recognizes both <b>the</b> instrumental or <b>rule</b> book dimension and the substantive or rights dimension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. It also accepts that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law, while universal in its conceptualization, must accommodate cultural particularities of different societies. Moreover, this model acknowledges that local and global versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law operate coherently in these different geographies, and that both local and global <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law discourses are bounded by human rights parameters of full personhood, dignity, and justice...|$|R

40|$|This paper does three things. First, {{based on}} {{a limited number of}} {{theoretically}} established dimensions, it proposes a new de facto indicator for <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law.

Second, using this indicator we shed new light on the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and <b>the</b> political system of a country. Third, because political systems hardly predetermine <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law level of a country, we investigate <b>the</b> roots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. As theory on this specific question is scarce and <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law is closely associated with income levels, we draw on a topical literature that deals with the fundamental causes of economic development.
