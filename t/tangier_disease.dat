25|$|Human ABC {{transporters}} {{are involved}} in several diseases that arise from polymorphisms in ABC genes and rarely due to complete loss of function of single ABC proteins. Such diseases include Mendelian diseases and complex genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, Stargardt disease, <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease,</b> immune deficiencies, progressive familial intraheptic cholestasis, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy due to focal adenomatous hyperplasia, X-linked sideroblastosis and anemia, age-related macular degeneration, familial hypoapoproteinemia, Retinitis pigmentosum, cone rod dystrophy, and others. The human ABCB (MDR/TAP) family is responsible for multiple drug resistance (MDR) against a variety of structurally unrelated drugs. ABCB1 or MDR1 P-glycoprotein is also involved in other biological processes for which lipid transport is the main function. It is found to mediate the secretion of the steroid aldosterone by the adrenals, and its inhibition blocked the migration of dendritic immune cells, possibly related to the outward transport of the lipid platelet activating factor (PAF). It has also been reported that ABCB1 mediates transport of cortisol and dexamethasone, but not of progesterone in ABCB1 transfected cells. MDR1 can also transport cholesterol, short-chain and long-chain analogs of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), sphingomyelin (SM), and glucosylceramide (GlcCer). Multispecific transport of diverse endogenous lipids through the MDR1 transporter can possibly affect the transbilayer distribution of lipids, in particular of species normally predominant on the inner plasma membrane leaflet such as PS and PE.|$|E

50|$|Mutations to {{chromosome}} 9q31 lead to {{a defective}} ABCA1 transporter. These mutations prevent the ABCA1 protein from effectively transporting cholesterol and phospholipids out of cells for pickup by ApoA1 in the bloodstream. This inability to transport cholesterol out of cells leads to a deficiency of high-density lipoproteins in the circulation, which is {{a risk factor for}} coronary artery disease. Additionally, the buildup of cholesterol in cells can be toxic, causing cell death or impaired function. These combined factors lead to the signs and symptoms of <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
50|$|High-density lipoproteins {{are created}} when a protein in the bloodstream, Apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), {{combines}} with cholesterol and phospholipids. The cholesterol and phospholipids used to form HDL originate from inside cells but are transported {{out of the}} cell into the blood via the ABCA1 transporter. People with <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease</b> have defective ABCA1 transporters resulting in a greatly reduced ability to transport cholesterol out of their cells, which leads to an accumulation of cholesterol and phospholipids in many body tissues, which can cause them to increase in size. Reduced blood levels of high-density lipoproteins is sometimes described as hypoalphalipoproteinemia.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tangier</b> <b>disease</b> {{is a rare}} {{familial}} disorder {{characterized by}} extremely low levels of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and high density lipoproteins (HDL). In normal subjects, proapoA-I is secreted into plasma and converted to mature apoA-I by the cleavage of the amino-terminal six amino acids with the major isoprotein in plasma being mature apoA-I. In contrast, in <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease</b> there is a marked relative increase of proapoA-I as compared with mature apoA-I. ProapoA-I and mature apoA-I were isolated from normal and <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease</b> subjects, radio-labeled, and autologous apoA-I isoproteins injected into normal and Tangier subjects. The in vivo catabolism and conversion of proapoA-I and mature apoA-I in normal and <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease</b> subjects were quantitated. A comparison of the rate of catabolism of apoA-I isoproteins from plasma revealed a significantly faster rate of catabolism of both isoproteins of apoA-I in Tangier subjects when compared with normal subjects. The fractional conversion rate of proapoA-I to mature apoA-I was 3. 9 d- 1 in normal subjects and 3. 6 d- 1 in Tangier subjects. The results indicate that (a) apoA-I enters plasma as the pro isoprotein in both normal and Tangier subjects, (b) <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease</b> subjects have a normal fractional rate of conversion of proapoA-I to mature apoA-I, (c) proapoA-I is catabolized {{at the same rate}} as mature apoA-I in Tangier subjects, and (d) Tangier subjects catabolize both pro and mature apoA-I at a much greater rate than do normal subjects. Therefore, the relative increase in proapoA-I in <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease</b> is due to a marked decrease in mature apoA-I resulting from rapid catabolism of both pro- and mature apoA-I and not to defective conversion of proapoA-I to mature apoA-I...|$|E

Gln 1038 *. In a remarkably large <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease</b> pedigree with four affected siblings, we identified compound heterozygosity for previously reported missense variants, p. Arg 937 Val and p. Thr 940 Met, and show that both of these mutations result in significantly impaired cholesterol efflux in transfected cells. In a third pedigree, the proband was identified to be compound heterozygous for two novel mutations, a frameshift (p.

ABC 1, {{a member of the}} ATP-binding cassette family, recently has been identified as the defective gene in <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease.</b> We report here the organization of the human ABC 1 gene and the identification of a mutation in the ABC 1 gene from the original <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease</b> kindred. The organization of the human ABC 1 gene {{is similar to that of}} the mouse ABC 1 gene and other related ABC genes. The ABC 1 gene contains 49 exons that range in size from 33 to 249 bp and is over 70 kb in length. Sequence analysis of the ABC 1 gene revealed that the proband for <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease</b> was homozygous for a deletion of nucleotides 3283 and 3284 (TC) in exon 22. The deletion results in a frameshift mutation and a premature stop codon starting at nucleotide 3375.

The loss of a Mnl 1 restriction site, which results from the deletion, was used to establish the genotype of the rest of the kindred. In summary, we report on the genomic organization of the human ABC 1 gene and identify a frameshift mutation in the ABC 1 gene of the index case of <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease.</b> These results will be useful in the future characterization of the structure and function of the ABC 1 gene and the analysis of additional ABC 1 mutations in patients with <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Tangier</b> <b>disease</b> is a {{familial}} disorder {{characterized by}} orange tonsils, cholesterol ester deposition in reticuloendothelial cells, abnormal chylomicron remnants, and a marked reduction in high density lipoproteins. Plasma concentrations of the apolipoproteins apo-A-I and apoA-II {{in patients with}} <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease</b> are approximately 1 % and 7 % of those in normal subjects, respectively. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the low plasma concentrations of apoA-I and apoA-II are due to increased fractional catabolism with a relatively normal apoA-I and apoA-II synthesis. Plasma apoA-I and apoA-II were isolated to electrophoretic homogeneity from delipidated plasma lipoproteins from a patient with <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease.</b> ApoA-I Tangier differed from apoA-I from control subjects in amino acid composition, electrophoretic mobility, apparent molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and heterogeneity of isoforms on isoelectric focusing.

These results have been interpreted as indicating that apoA-I Tangier has a different covalent structure than does normal apoA-I, and apoA-II Tangier is identical to normal apoA-II. This structural change in apoA-I Tangier is associated with rapid catabolism of apoA-I Tangier-and apoA-II Tangier-containing plasma lipoproteins, and it leads to the deficiency in high density lipoproteins, abnormal chylomicron remnants, and the intracellular accumulation of cholesterol ester characteristic of <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|E

RESULTS: Membranous inclusions in the stroma were seen on transmission electron microscopy.

Tangier cornea showed major thermotropic phase transitions in the range 28 - 37 degrees C, peak 30 - 33 degrees C, extending above profiles of normal clear cornea and without the complexity of those seen with cornea with heavy arcus involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Lipid accumulation underlies corneal opacification in <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease.</b> The excess material is mainly phospholipid and cholesterol esters.

40|$|<b>Tangier</b> <b>disease</b> (deficiency of {{high density}} plasma lipoproteins) is {{characterized}} clinically by: {{low levels of}} plasma cholesterol; enlarged, orange-yellow to yellow-gray tonsils and, frequently, peripheral neuropathy. Histologic and ultrastructural studies were made of various tissues from 5 patients with <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease,</b> and comparisons were made of these findings {{with those in the}} 12 other patients thus far known to have this disease. Deposits of cholesteryl esters were found in: reticuloendothelial cells (foam cells) in tonsils, bone marrow, skin and jejunal submucosa; Schwann cells in peripheral nerves and myenteric plexus; and in nonvascular smooth muscle cells. These deposits appeared electron lucent and intensely birefringent, varied from spherical to crystalline in shape, often were extensively confluent throughout large areas of cytoplasm, and were not limited by membranes. Certain foam cells in bone marrow also contained membrane-limited clusters of lipid particles resembling chylomicrons. The foam cells in <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease</b> differ morphologically from those in numerous lysosomal enzyme deficiency states, particularly Wolman's disease and cholesteryl ester stroage disease, and in proliferative diseases of the reticuloendothelial system in which cholesteryl esters also accumulate in abnormal histiocytes. Morphologic and biochemical data suggest several hypotheses to explain the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in tissues of patients with <b>Tangier</b> <b>disease.</b> Among these hypotheses, the most likely are considered to be the presence in plasma of abnormal lipoprotein particles that are subject to phagocytic removal by reticuloendothelial cells, and the failure of a process that normally removes locally synthesized cholesterol from cells to plasma.

Intact HDL also was unable to clear cholesteryl esters from Tangier cells even though it promoted radiolabeled cholesterol efflux to levels 50 - 70 % normal. Passive desorption of radiolabeled cholesterol or phospholipids into medium containing albumin or trypsinized HDL was normal for Tangier cells. Binding studies showed that the interaction of apo A-I with high-affinity binding sites on Tangier fibroblasts was abnormal. These results indicate that apo A-I has an impaired ability to remove cholesterol and phospholipid from Tangier fibroblasts, possibly because of a defective interaction of apo A-I with cell-surface binding sites.
