5|$|The {{start of}} the Industrial Revolution was marked by a massive boom in the textile industry, with {{remarkable}} technological innovations made, led by the cotton industry of Great Britain. In its early years, there were often disparities in <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> between different stages of fabric manufacture, which encouraged complementary innovations. For example, spinning progressed much more rapidly than weaving.|$|E

The more popular Loves of the Plants promotes, revises and illustrates Linnaeus's classification scheme for plants.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{theoretical and}} empirical scientific literature {{about the impact of}} <b>technological</b> <b>innovations</b> on unemployment, considering the former as a key driver of long-term productivity and economic growth. Using panel data from 25 European countries for the period of 2000 – 2012, we aim to examine whether <b>technological</b> <b>innovations</b> affect unemployment. We used triadic patent families per million inhabitants as our main proxy for <b>technological</b> <b>innovations,</b> as well as other unemployment controls, in our model, which were estimated using System Generalized Method of Moments (SGMM). Finding no significant relationship between <b>technological</b> <b>innovations</b> and unemployment in our base estimation, we re-estimated it testing the impact with a time lag as well as using alternative proxies for <b>technological</b> <b>innovations.</b> Overall, the research estimations do not suggest that <b>technological</b> <b>innovations</b> have an effect on unemployment...|$|R

First, primary and secondary data are {{used to evaluate the}} main types of research and <b>technological</b> <b>innovations</b> and, in sequence, it is evaluated the importance of <b>technological</b> <b>innovations</b> that have contributed to the expansion of the Brazilian pulp industry in the pulp world market. <b>Technological</b> <b>innovations</b> in forest and industrial areas in the Brazilian pulp industry have brought significant increases of forest and industrial productivities, leading to reduction of pulp production cost. Consequently, profitability of the industry has been enlarged, causing its expansion. Finally, the paper analyzes future challenges for the Brazilian pulp industry in relation to research and <b>technological</b> <b>innovations</b> able to maintain its competitiveness internationally. pulp, research, <b>technological</b> <b>innovations,</b> silviculture., Agribusiness, Q 16, Q 23,...|$|R

5|$|The United States {{has been}} a leader in <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> since the late 19th century and {{scientific}} research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories {{during the first half of}} the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor saving techniques created the system called mass production.|$|E

5|$|The {{invention}} of the wheel was a major <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> {{that gave rise to}} chariot warfare. At first, equines, both horses and onagers, were hitched to wheeled carts by means of a yoke around their necks {{in a manner similar to}} that of oxen. However, such a design is incompatible with equine anatomy, limiting both the strength and mobility of the animal. By the time of the Hyksos invasions of Egypt, c.1600 BC, horses were pulling chariots with an improved harness design that made use of a breastcollar and breeching, which allowed a horse to move faster and pull more weight.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fifth}} book begins, the setting shifts briefly to North America. Following the Ural War, the Japanese had led an Asian {{occupation}} of western North America. The local populations, inspired by Native American beliefs and mythologies, react by leaving the cities for the wilderness and destroying the food factories and cities, eventually driving out the Asian occupation. In America and then globally people begin leaving cities {{in favor of}} the wild. Shamanism and the belief in ghosts reemerge amongst the populace, as does an oral tradition of story-telling. The draining of the cities grows into a settler movement: egalitarian communities that live in nature, characterized by gender equality and sexual liberation. In response to the threat this movement poses to the ruling Senates, political leaders in London hatch a plan to colonize Greenland, thereby channeling both the drive for <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> and the drive to settle new land.|$|E
5|$|Carte's London {{house was}} at the Adelphi, {{not far from the}} Savoy. Passionate about the visual arts as well as the {{performing}} arts, Carte invited his friend, the artist James McNeill Whistler, to decorate the house. Whistler had the entire billiard room painted the colour of the billiard cloth, and elsewhere painted his favourite yellow with his own hand. Equally enthusiastic for <b>technological</b> <b>innovation,</b> Carte installed a lift, the first in a private house in England. Around 1890, he bought a small island in the River Thames, between Weybridge and Shepperton, called Folly Eyot, which he renamed D'Oyly Carte Island. He wanted to use the island as an annex to his new Savoy Hotel, but the local authorities refused to grant him a drinks licence for the property. Instead, he built Eyot House, a large house and garden on the island, that he used as a residence. In later years, Carte displayed his macabre sense of humour by keeping a crocodile on the island.|$|E

5|$|The {{standard}} EVA Air livery utilizes dark green, signifying durability, and orange, representing <b>technological</b> <b>innovation.</b> The tail globe logo {{is intended}} to represent stability and reliability, and its positioning on the tail, with one corner off the edge, represents service innovation. The EVA Air livery was updated in 2002, adding a larger typeface {{and the use of}} green covering the aircraft below the window line. The tail design and logo remained unchanged. In late 2015, EVA Air redesigned their livery and tail logo, using the dark green color on the belly, and cancelled the orange line {{on the edge of the}} tail to highlight the corporate identity. It's the third generation livery of EVA Air, symbolizing their ambition to connect Taiwan to the world.|$|E
5|$|While The Loves of the Plants {{celebrates the}} natural world and {{advances}} several scientific hypotheses regarding {{the formation of the}} cosmos, the moon and the earth, The Economy of Vegetation celebrates scientific progress and <b>technological</b> <b>innovation,</b> such as the forging of steel, the invention of the steam engine and the improvements to gunpowder. It depicts scientists and inventors, such as Benjamin Franklin, responsible for this progress as the heroes of a new age; he “mythologizes” them. The poem at some points goes further, into what would now be called science fiction, forecasting that the British Empire will have giant steam-powered airships ("The flying-chariot through the fields of air. Fair crews triumphant, leaning from above") and far-ranging submarines ("Britain's sons shall guide | Huge sea-balloons beneath the tossing tide; The diving castles, roof'd with spheric glass, Ribb'd with strong oak, and barr'd with bolts of brass, Buoy'd with pure air shall endless tracks pursue").|$|E
