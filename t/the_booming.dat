5|$|In {{his time}} in office, Joliet changed from an economy of a prison town with declining {{population}} to a fast-growing entertainment and tourism economy, focused on riverboat casinos. Residential and commercial construction increased and racing tracks, a baseball stadium, and several civic works developed {{as a result of}} <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> economy.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Sid Sheinberg, the {{president}} of MCA and Universal City Studios and a seasoned attorney, {{was trying to find}} a way to get his company into <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> video game market. In April, he learned of the success of Nintendo's Donkey Kong video game and sent Robert Hadl, vice president of legislative matters, to investigate. Hadl's analysis was that Donkey Kongs storyline was based on that of King Kong and was thus an infringement of Universal's rights to that film's characters and scenario.|$|E
5|$|A workhouse {{was built}} in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law which stated that each Poor Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief to the {{increasing}} numbers of destitute poor. In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2,715, this increased to 4,677 by 1841. There {{were a couple of}} reasons for this large growth in population. Firstly the opportunities provided by <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> linen industry led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan in the hope of gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the construction of new buildings such as Brownlow House.|$|E
50|$|The forward end of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> {{attaches}} to a mast {{just below the}} sail, with a joint called the gooseneck. The gooseneck pivots allowing {{the other end of}} <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> to move freely. The clew (back corner) of the sail {{attaches to}} the free end of <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> <b>The</b> entire foot of the sail may be attached to <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> or just <b>the</b> clew. If the foot is not attached to <b>the</b> <b>boom,</b> <b>the</b> rig is known as loose footed.|$|R
50|$|A Chicago boom derrick is a derrick with a boom {{which is}} {{attached}} to an external structure. The external upright member of the structure serves as the mast, and <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> is stepped in a fixed socket clamped to <b>the</b> upright. <b>The</b> <b>boom</b> is connected to at least three pulley systems to control the position of <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> For example, a pulley system {{is connected to the}} top of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> and <b>the</b> higher area of the external structure and two pulley systems near the top of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> connected on either side of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> to <b>the</b> external structure. The position of the top of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> can be controlled by manipulating these pulley systems. The load is lifted from a separate pulley system that is connected to the top of <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b>|$|R
50|$|A gnav (the word vang spelt backwards) is an {{inverted}} vang. It is a rigid strut that extends obliquely upward from <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> to <b>the</b> mast, exerting {{a force that}} pushes down on <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> As <b>the</b> fixing point of the gnav on <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> is hauled inwards towards the mast, the downward force on <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> increases. A gnav offers more uncluttered space beneath <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> when compared to a vang.|$|R
5|$|In 1900, Potter revised a {{tale about}} a rabbit named Peter {{she had written}} for a child in 1893, and {{prepared}} a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1889 best-seller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer, she published the book {{for family and friends}} at her own expense in December 1901. Frederick Warne & Co. had earlier rejected the tale, but, anxious to compete in <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted it following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke. Potter agreed to colour the pen and ink illustrations of the private edition, and chose the then-new Hentschel three-colour process for reproducing her watercolours. On 2 October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was released.|$|E
5|$|The last {{relic of}} the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, the Fairfield Plant, {{continues}} to be operated by U. S. Steel {{as one of its}} five integrated steel mills in the USA. It is the largest steel-making plant in Alabama, employing 2,000 workers as of September 2006, down from a peak of 45,000 during World War II. With a single blast furnace and three basic oxygen process furnaces, amongst other various mills and production facilities, the plant produces 2.4 million tons of raw steel per annum and 640,000 tons of seamless tubular and sheet products, mainly for purchase by <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> oil industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{aesthetics}} of film noir {{are influenced by}} German Expressionism, an artistic movement of the 1910s and 1920s that involved theater, photography, painting, sculpture and architecture, as well as cinema. The opportunities offered by <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> Hollywood film industry and then the threat of Nazism, led to the emigration of many film artists working in Germany who {{had been involved in}} the Expressionist movement or studied with its practitioners. M (Fritz Lang 1931), shot only a few years before his departure from Germany, is among the first crime films of the sound era to join a characteristically noirish visual style with a noir-type plot, in which the protagonist is a criminal (as are his most successful pursuers). Directors such as Lang, Robert Siodmak and Michael Curtiz brought a dramatically shadowed lighting style and a psychologically expressive approach to visual composition (mise-en-scène), with them to Hollywood, where they made some of the most famous classic noirs.|$|E
40|$|A {{suspension}} apparatus for suspending instrumentation from an {{airborne platform}} may include a generally longitudinal boom having a payload end and a tail end. Yaw and pitch stabilizers may be disposed {{at the tail}} end of <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> A mast that may be selectively translatable on <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> may connect <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> to a tether line of the airborne platform. The payload may be attached to the payload end of <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> <b>The</b> mast may be positioned axially along <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> at <b>the</b> center of gravity of the combination of <b>the</b> payload, <b>boom,</b> pitch stabilizer, and yaw stabilizer...|$|R
50|$|On small sailboats {{and some}} {{cruising}} sailboats a vang may be omitted. If a vang is not installed, then the sheet has {{to try to}} control both horizontal and vertical angles of <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> is near <b>the</b> centerline, the sheet is nearly vertical, and can exert downward force on <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> As <b>the</b> sheet is loosened to increase the horizontal angle of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> and sail, <b>the</b> sheet becomes horizontal and exerts less downward force. A vang works with the sheet to apply the downward force on <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> at all horizontal angles, allowing the sheet {{to be used to}} control the horizontal angle of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> effectively.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "flying" [...] boom is {{so named}} because flight control surfaces, small movable {{airfoils}} that are often in a V-tail configuration, are used to move <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> by creating aerodynamic forces. They are actuated hydraulically and controlled by <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> operator using a control stick. <b>The</b> <b>boom</b> operator also telescopes <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> to make <b>the</b> connection with the receiver's receptacle.|$|R
5|$|The Great Famine in Ireland of the 1840s drove {{migrants}} {{across the}} Irish Sea, and many {{settled in the}} industrial cities of the North, especially Manchester and Liverpool – at the 1851 census, 13% {{of the population of}} Manchester and Salford were Irish-born, and in Liverpool the figure was 22%. In response there was a wave of anti-Catholic riots and Protestant Orange Orders proliferated across Northern England, chiefly in Lancashire, but also elsewhere in the North. By 1881 there were 374 Orange organisations in Lancashire, 71 in the North East, and 42 in Yorkshire. From further afield, Northern England saw immigration from European countries such as Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia and Scandinavia, and from East Asia and Africa. Some immigrants were well-to-do industrialists seeking to do business in <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> industrial cities, some were escaping poverty, some were servants or slaves, some were sailors who chose to settle in the port towns, some were Jews fleeing pogroms on the continent, and some were migrants originally stranded at Liverpool after attempting to catch an onwards ship to the United States or to colonies of the British Empire. At the same time, hundreds of thousands from depressed rural areas of the North emigrated, chiefly to the US, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>boom</b> {{operated}} {{for eight}} months. The 150 employees were paid $1.50 {{per day for}} their work. The owners of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> paid an average of $50,000 per year to their employees {{for an average of}} $333.33 per man. This low pay compared to the millions that the owners of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> and some of the mills brought about some hard feelings among the workers of <b>the</b> Susquehanna <b>Boom.</b> <b>The</b> workers of <b>the</b> <b>boom,</b> <b>the</b> lumber jacks, and the sawmill workers banded together in 1872 went on strike that summer.|$|R
50|$|Guy derrick (also {{known as}} boom derrick) is a fixed guyed mast derrick {{that can be}} rotated and {{connected}} to a <b>boom.</b> <b>The</b> mast is in upright position with the base that can make the mast rotate, but not to be lean in any direction. The top of the mast is connected to many guy wires which are anchored to the ground to support the load. At the base, the mast is also connect to the bottom end of <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> <b>The</b> <b>boom</b> extends outward and upward to the desired position. The top of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> is a pulley system that {{is connected to the}} top of the mast to control how far <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> is to be from the mast. When the mast is rotated, <b>the</b> connected <b>boom</b> is swung from to the side. The control of the lifting location is done by the manipulation of the top pulley system and the rotation of the mast at the base. The load is lifted by another pulley system connected to the top of <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> In a medium load lifting, another construction method can be used. In this case, the mast is fixed without being rotated, but <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> can be swung around the mast. This can be done by connecting the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> with two boards on the opposite sides around the surface of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> to form a fork. The fork and the bottom part of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> is lashed to secure them together. Another lashing is between the fork area and the mast at a higher position to support the weight of <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> <b>The</b> fork is put around the mast such that the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> is rested on the mast without permanently fixed to it. The fork prevent <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> to come off the mast while swinging up to 180 degrees.|$|R
5000|$|Lash the tack reef cringle to <b>the</b> <b>boom,</b> or secure on reefing hook if present.Pull the leech reef cringle {{away from}} the mast, {{stretching}} the sail taut along <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> Lash <b>the</b> leech cringle to <b>the</b> <b>boom,</b> {{and then to the}} end of <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> Then tie <b>the</b> remaining reefs with sail ties. With lighter gauge sails or reef points reef the sail to itself rather than around <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> to prevent <b>the</b> reefing cringles from being torn out. Secure the sail ties with a reef (square) knot.|$|R

25|$|When the {{construction}} of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway was announced, Cataline moved his operations to Quesnel to better serve <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> Central Interior. He packed throughout the Cariboo, Central Interior and Skeena River district until 1912 when he retired in Hazelton.|$|E
25|$|In {{the past}} money {{laundering}} {{was not considered}} a significant problem in China. However, with <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> economy promoting greater trade investment and the ever-increasing number of foreign bank branches opening throughout the country, it appears that China may become an emerging money laundering center.|$|E

25|$|To {{complete}} an aerial refueling, the tanker and receiver aircraft rendezvous, flying in formation. The receiver {{moves to a}} position behind the tanker, within safe limits of travel for <b>the</b> <b>boom,</b> aided by director lights or directions radioed by <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> operator. Once in position, the operator extends <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> {{to make contact with}} the receiver aircraft. Once in contact, fuel is pumped through <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> into <b>the</b> receiver aircraft.|$|R

25|$|The {{properties}} {{associated with}} the Brogdens in Tondu and Maesteg were purchased by North's Navigation Collieries Ltd in 1889. The new company, initially led by Colonel John T. North, the 'Nitrate King', produced iron at the Tondu site until 1896 before concentrating on <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> coal trade in the Llynfi and Ogmore valleys.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with other}} {{contemporary}} neighborhoods, such as Palmer Woods and the Grosse Pointes, Rosedale Park has more modest house and lot sizes reflecting the solidly middle- and upper-middle class {{status of the}} original homeowners. Many of these original homeowners were professionals, such as doctors and dentists, and accountants, or had white-collar jobs in <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> automobile industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{employed}} people increased from 571,400 in 2000 to 704,700, despite a significant decline agricultural and fishing employment. <b>The</b> <b>booming</b> industrial sector created 63,200 {{jobs in the}} period and employs 99,200 as of 2007. Despite lacking behind the industrial sector in terms of value-added, the service sector employed 180,500 people in 2007 compared to 57,900 in 2000.|$|E
50|$|On some sailing boats, {{such as the}} 49er, {{rather than}} a set of lines pulling <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> downwards, a rigid member is used to push <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> down. By {{controlling}} leech tension, <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> vang {{is one of the}} three methods of controlling sail twist.|$|R
50|$|A safe jibe can be {{aided by}} {{tensioning}} <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> vang (kicking strap) to prevent <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> from lifting. In fresh winds, sailing nearly directly downwind briefly {{before and after}} the jibe and making only a small direction changes will produce less heeling force and reduce the tendency to round-up. In heavier gusts, the crew or skipper can sheet <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> in and force <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> across <b>the</b> boat by hand, holding <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> in position by locking the traveler or using a preventer. After the jibe has been completed, the course can then be changed to higher points of sail.|$|R
50|$|Another form of {{preventer}} is <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> brake, which, when sailing downwind, {{can also}} be used to jibe the mainsail in a slow, measured action. The brake usually rides on a line running perpendicular to, and below <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> brake is actuated, friction on the line either works as a preventer (stops <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> from moving in the direction that would slacken the main sheet), or slows <b>the</b> <b>boom’s</b> speed while jibing. The brake is actuated by either tensioning the line upon which it rides or by using a second line to adjust the brake itself.|$|R
25|$|The Great Fire of Ipoh in 1892 {{destroyed}} {{over half}} the town, but also presented an opportunity to rebuild the town in a more orderly grid pattern. Ipoh was subsequently rebuilt {{in time for the}} second tin rush and grew rapidly as a result of <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> tin mining industry, particularly in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
25|$|In September 2015, it was {{reported}} by Bloomberg that {{the owner of the}} site now instead plans to build a , 70-story luxury condominium building at the site to take advantage of <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> residential real estate market in lower Manhattan. In addition to the 70-story condo at 45 Park Place, El-Gamal plans a three story Islamic museum at 51 Park Place.|$|E
25|$|Approval of {{the office}} tower was delayed due to a dispute with the Department of Transport {{about the number of}} car parking bays which could be {{included}} in the development, and it was rumoured that the building may not proceed due to difficulties in Hai Sun Hup securing financing. However, the construction was made viable by <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> resources industry in Western Australia.|$|E
50|$|Various {{hardware}} {{is found}} attached to <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> <b>The</b> hardware could include fairleads, blocks, block tracks, and cleats. For attachment, screws are used on wooden booms and screws or rivets on aluminium <b>booms.</b> If <b>the</b> {{foot of the}} sail is attached to <b>the</b> <b>boom,</b> there may be hoops from {{the foot of the}} sail, around <b>the</b> <b>boom,</b> or there may be a track on the top of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> into which fittings on the foot of the sail are slid.|$|R
2500|$|While in contact, the {{receiver}} pilot {{must continue to}} fly within the [...] "air refueling envelope," [...] {{the area in which}} contact with <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> is safe. Moving outside of this envelope can damage <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> or lead to mid-air collision, for example the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash. If the receiving aircraft approaches the outer limits of <b>the</b> envelope, <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> operator will command {{the receiver}} pilot to correct his position and disconnect <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> if necessary.|$|R
50|$|Three sail shape {{controls}} which {{control the}} leech tension, and therefore sail twist, are <b>the</b> mainsheet, <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> vang and <b>the</b> traveler. The mainsheet pulls <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> (and therefore <b>the</b> {{foot of the}} sail) primarily inwards at lower points of sail and downwards at higher points of sail. Manipulation of the traveler can counteract this because it always pulls <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> laterally. <b>The</b> vang {{on the other hand}} does the opposite, it always changes the height of <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b>|$|R
