5|$|One monk {{was thrown}} from a balcony {{down to the}} {{courtyard}} six meters below. Nhu's men vandalized the main altar and confiscated the intact charred heart of Thích Quảng Đức, which had failed to burn during his re-cremation. However, some of the Buddhists were able to flee the pagoda with a receptacle containing his ashes. Two monks jumped <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> Xá Lợi to enter {{the grounds of the}} adjoining United States Agency for International Development (USAID) mission, where they were given asylum, despite the presence of troops behind the pagoda walls who opened fire with automatic weapons on any monks who tried to flee by jumping the fence.|$|E
50|$|Since early Lycian times, the city's {{settlement}} was likely {{concentrated on the}} southern slope and western slopes. Wide terraces with cisterns and <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> buildings carved from the rock are found there, {{as well as an}} agora, a Roman-era theatre, for plays and concerts, public roman baths and the remains of an early Byzantine church.|$|R

25|$|Dating to the mid-4th century BCE, the stoa {{measured}} 11 by 110m with 39 exterior Doric {{columns and}} 17 internal Ionic columns. There were stone benches set into <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure, perhaps where the suppliants {{of the god}} slept and awaited their dreams.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the room, {{which is}} in shadow, is hung with rows of paintings, {{including}} {{one of a series}} of scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses by Peter Paul Rubens, and copies, by Velázquez's son-in-law and principal assistant Juan del Mazo, of works by Jacob Jordaens. The paintings are shown in the exact positions recorded in an inventory taken around this time. The wall to the right is hung with a grid of eight smaller paintings, visible mainly as frames owing to their angle from the viewer. They can be identified from the inventory as more Mazo copies of paintings from the Rubens Ovid series, though only two of the subjects can be seen.|$|E
5|$|The Capitoline Temple {{stands behind}} the {{basilica}} within what would originally {{have been an}} arcaded courtyard. An altar stands in the courtyard in front of 13 steps {{leading up to the}} Corinthian-columned temple, which had a single cella. The building was of great importance to civic life as it was dedicated to the three chief divinities of the Roman state, Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. Civic assemblies were held in front of the temple to beseech the aid of the gods or to thank them for successes in major civic undertakings such as fighting wars. The layout of the temple, facing <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the basilica, is somewhat unusual and {{it has been suggested that}} it may have been built on top of an existing shrine. An inscription found in 1924 records that it was reconstructed in 218. It was partly restored in 1955 and given a more substantial restoration in 1962, reconstructing 10 of the 13 steps, the walls of the cella and the columns. There were four more small shrines within the temple precinct, one of which was dedicated to Venus.|$|E

50|$|Throughout {{the years}} various {{improvements}} were made. The rectory {{was completed in}} 1958. In the spring of 1958, the old church-rectory was demolished. On July 21, 1959, the parish became free of debt. In November 1965 an Italian-made mosaic was installed on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main and side altars. In 1968 a Catechetical Center was completed. This required {{the purchase of the}} remaining half block of property west of the church and the demolition of the buildings.|$|R
50|$|In particular, on {{this tour}} Keane {{emphasized}} the percussive {{nature of the}} piano, since they had discovered during the U2 shows that the piano sound echoed off <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> arenas, giving it a delayed, doubling sound effect that further made the group's sound dense. Thus for the Under the Iron Sea tour, the group's sound crew added a delay element into the processing of the piano mic pickups, thereby reproducing that arena effect in the band's smaller-sized venues when headlining.|$|R
5000|$|Jack Harrold (June 10, 1920 - July 22, 1994) was an American operatic tenor {{and voice}} teacher. Admired for his comedic skills, he {{specialized}} in the tenor buffo repertoire. He had a particularly long {{association with the}} New York City Opera from the 1940s through the 1980s. He also appeared in several Broadway musicals. Danny Newman of the Lyric Opera of Chicago stated that, [...] "Jack Harrold was one of American musical theater's most beloved and most versatile performers, possessing a clarion tenor voice that practically bounced off <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biggest theaters." ...|$|R

A rectory, which stood behind the church, was sold and removed in early 2004, and a recent steel building has been constructed in its place. The original timber church has also been demolished. St Paul's continues to function as the main church for the Parish of Proserpine.|$|E

25|$|Zbigniew Uglik, a 23-year-old of Polish {{heritage}} {{who lived}} in England, was shot dead {{at the rear of}} a house on 4 July. He was an amateur photographer and had been taking photographs of the riots. Uglik was in a house at Albert Street, {{at the edge of the}} curfew zone, and decided to fetch another camera from the hotel where he was staying.

25|$|Since their {{introduction}} in the mid-1980s, in-ear monitors {{have grown}} {{to be the most}} popular monitoring choice for large touring acts. The reduction or elimination of loudspeakers other than instrument amplifiers on stage has allowed for cleaner and less problematic mixing situations for both the front of house and monitor engineers. Audio feedback is greatly reduced and there is less sound reflecting off <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the stage out into the audience, which affects the clarity of the mix the front of house engineer is attempting to create.|$|E

25|$|On {{the advice}} of {{acoustics}} firm, Kirkegaard Associates, the lack of reverberation and the difficult performance conditions for musicians were corrected by changes {{in the fabric of}} the auditorium. Surfaces that had previously absorbed sound were transformed to support and sustain that sound. The tapestries on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boxes were gathered up to increase reverberation, but can be redeployed, together with additional absorbent blinds above the stage and around the Hall whenever needed. The wooden <b>wall</b> panels <b>of</b> the Hall were relined to change their acoustic qualities and the undulating plaster ceiling panels were completely reconstructed using more robust materials to provide greater warmth of sound and support for bass frequencies.|$|R

Thich Tinh Khiet, an eighty-year-old Buddhist patriarch, was seized and taken to a military hospital on the outskirts of Saigon. Military control, press censorship and the airport closures were enacted in Saigon.|$|E
25|$|The vaginal {{plate is}} the {{precursor}} to the vagina. During development, the vaginal plate begins to grow where the solid ends of the paramesonephric ducts (Müllerian ducts) enter <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the urogenital sinus. As the plate grows, it separates the sinus into the urethra and the vagina and extends the vagina by pushing the cervix deeper. Originally full of cells, as the central cells of the plate break down, the lumen of the vagina is formed. This usually occurs by the twenty to twenty-fourth week of development. If the lumen does not form, or is incomplete, membranes across or around the tract called septae can form, which may cause obstruction of the outflow tract later in life.|$|E
