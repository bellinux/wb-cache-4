25|$|Atwater: As to {{the whole}} Southern {{strategy}} that Harry S. Dent, Sr. and others put together in 1968, opposition to the Voting Rights Act {{would have been a}} central part of keeping the South. Now you don't have to do that. All that you need <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the South is for Reagan to run in place on the issues that he's campaigned on since 1964, and that's fiscal conservatism, balancing the budget, cut taxes, you know, the whole cluster.|$|E
25|$|After a lap {{behind the}} safety car, the field were let loose {{again at the}} {{beginning}} of lap three. Vernay closed in on his Italian team-mate, slipstreaming past him on the run to the Mandarin, and doing enough to hold off Mortara into Lisboa. For the ensuing laps, Vernay was doing what he had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his team-mate, who had stepped back from GP2 to rid himself of his close defeat to Keisuke Kunimoto in the previous year's race. Further back, Bianchi, who had avoided the first lap incidents was quietly moving his way up the field, and was eleventh by the end of lap seven. Sims had also dropped to the tail of the field, after a move on Cozzolino failed, and he made an unscheduled trip up the Lisboa escape road. Mortara started charging back towards Vernay, and in the process, broke the Frenchman's lap record set the day before. Mortara lowered it to a lap of 2:10.732, lapping the circuit at close to 105mph, and well under the previous record held by Marko Asmer. Cozzolino exited the race on lap eleven, crashing at Black Sands without the need for the safety car to reappear.|$|E
500|$|On February 9, 1920, Morrow {{dispatched}} the Kentucky National Guard to Lexington {{to protect}} Will Lockett, a black World WarI veteran {{on trial for}} murder. Morrow told the state adjutant general [...] "Do {{as much as you}} have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> that negro {{in the hands of the}} law. If he falls into the hands of the mob I do not expect to see you alive." [...] Lockett had already confessed, without the benefit of a lawyer, to the murder. His trial took only thirty minutes as he pleaded guilty but asked for a life sentence instead of death. Despite his plea, he was sentenced to die in the electric chair.|$|E
5000|$|The US {{purchased}} Florida from Spain in 1819, and the Seminole expected {{they would}} have more <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the Americans from their territory. Bolek died that year and was succeeded as principal chief by his maternal grandnephew, Micanopy.|$|R

2500|$|When {{offering}} her suggestion on characters profiles for Findlay's sitcom idea, after ridiculing Findlay {{she went on}} to describe a character based on herself that should be [...] "highly intelligent and attractive in an unconventional way, with very strong legs from the years and years of yoga and running that she has had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her sanity in a toxic psychic environment that is 'the newsroom', and basically far too busy doing her job to get involved in your stupidity or, I'm sorry, your character's stupidity." ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{garden was}} the place where my {{appearance}} as a cyclist at the Vélodrome d’Hiver was thought up. Gleizes and Villon claimed that I wouldn’t be able to cycle 100 kilometres without putting a foot on the ground. I bet them that I could {{for the price of}} a lunch. It’s actually a pretty hard thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> going over 100 kilometres on country roads. Neither of my opponents had a car and they didn’t want to chase after me on one of those velocipedes. A journalist from our circle of friends suggested cycling in a velodrome which is actually just as tiring, especially for someone who is not used to it. But I agreed. A few days later, one morning at ten, I began my laps in the Vélodrome d’Hiver. An hour went by and then another. The spectators, Fernand Léger was among them, cheered me on with increasing enthusiasm until quite unexpectedly the sound of a gong brought me to a halt. I had won my meal by my honourable average speed. (Metzinger) ...|$|E
