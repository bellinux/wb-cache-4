5|$|In 1772, the French {{scientist}} Antoine Lavoisier used a lens {{to concentrate}} <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> <b>of</b> {{the sun on}} a diamond {{in an atmosphere of}} oxygen, and showed that the only product of the combustion was carbon dioxide, proving that diamond is composed of carbon. Later in 1797, the English chemist Smithson Tennant repeated and expanded that experiment. By demonstrating that burning diamond and graphite releases the same amount of gas, he established the chemical equivalence of these substances.|$|E
5|$|At around midday on 23 November Horrocks darkened {{his room}} and focused <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> <b>of</b> {{sunlight}} coming through the window onto the paper where the image could be observed safely. At his location in Much Hoole (the latitude of which he determined to be 53° 35'), he calculated that the transit should begin at about 3:00pm on Sunday the 24th, but he began his observations the previous day fearing that he might miss the event if his calculations proved to be inaccurate. On the Sunday he began observing at sunrise, the weather was cloudy, but he first saw the tiny black shadow of Venus crossing the Sun at about 3:15pm, and observed {{for half an hour}} until sunset at 3:53pm.|$|E

5|$|Geastrum triplex may be {{confused}} with G.saccatum or G.fimbriatum, as the rays do not always crack around the perimeter to form a bowl under the spore case. However, it is larger than either of these species. The combination of characteristics which distinguish G.triplex from other earthstars include the lack of debris adhering to the outer surfaces, the saucer-like base in which the spore case is seated, the relatively large size, the fibrillose peristome and the paler area surrounding the peristome separating it {{from the rest of}} the endoperidium. Unlike some other Geastrum species, <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> <b>of</b> G.triplex are not hygroscopic: they do not open and close in response to changes in humidity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of the emblem sits a green outline of Belarus, {{superimposed}} over <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> <b>of</b> a golden sun. The sun is partially covered by a globe, with the landmass (part of Eurasia) in purple and waters in blue. Lining the left and right sides of the emblem are stalks of wheat, superimposed with flowers. Clovers adorn the left wheat stalks; flax flowers adorn the right. Wrapped around the wheat stalks is a red and green ribbon bearing the colours of the flag of Belarus; the ribbon meets {{at the base of the}} emblem, where the name Republic of Belarus (Рэспублiка Беларусь) is inscribed in gold in the Belarusian language. At the top of the emblem there is a five-pointed red star.|$|E
5|$|Ritual {{scarification}} in Nri {{was known}} as Ichi {{of which there are}} two styles; the Nri style, and the Agbaja style. In the Nri style, the carved line ran {{from the center of the}} forehead down to the chin. A second line ran across the face, from the right cheek to the left. This was repeated to obtain a pattern meant to imitate <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> <b>of</b> the sun. In the Agbaja style, circles and semicircular patterns are added to the initial incisions to represent the moon. These scarifications were given to the representatives of the eze Nri; the mbùríchi. The scarification's were Nri's way of honoring the sun that they worshiped and was a form of ritual purification.|$|E

5000|$|First-angle projection: The {{points of}} {{interest}} are projected {{in the same direction}} as <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> sight; <b>the</b> points are projected onto the plane that lies behind the object, as determined by <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> sight; <b>the</b> plane of projection acts like the top of a table over which the {{points of interest}} are dropped into place.|$|R
5|$|The {{climate of}} a region depends {{on a number of}} factors, {{especially}} latitude. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the tropical climate at the equator to the polar climate in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the Earth's axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> <b>of</b> the sun. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons.|$|E
5|$|Picking {{up where}} Subspecies II leaves off, Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994) finds Michelle {{deep in the}} catacombs with Radu's mother, who brings her son {{back from the dead}} with Michelle's blood and the enchanted dagger that killed him; Radu, his mother, and Michelle return to Castle Vladislas. Michelle {{promises}} to obey Radu if he teaches her everything that he knows. Radu takes Michelle out hunting so she can enhance her powers, while Mel contacts a former operative of the CIA for help. While trying to rescue Michelle, Radu's mother quickly kills Mel's CIA friend, and knocks Mel unconscious. In an effort to get Michelle to stay with him forever, Radu kills his mother when she attacks Michelle. Becky arrives to save Michelle, but before everyone leaves, Michelle takes a gun from Becky, which contains silver bullets, and shoots Radu. The rising sun slows Michelle, so she is placed inside a body bag that was brought along; the delay allows Radu time to catch up to the group. Wanting the Bloodstone, which was taken by Michelle, Radu attempts to barter the group's lives in exchange for it. Becky throws it over the roof's edge, and when Radu attempts to follow it he is engulfed in <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> <b>of</b> the Sun. Radu's body bursts into flames and falls from the castle wall. Becky and the group make it to their car and drive off. Radu's burning corpse is left smoldering and impaled on tree branches, with his burning blood dropping to the ground; the flames go out and the blood morphs into new subspecies.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the arms on these medals, made by the U.S. Mint, follow the Trenchard design very closely.

It {{is possible that}} this Ray is Ray Terril, as his costume resembles <b>the</b> New Earth <b>Ray</b> Terril's new uniform. <b>The</b> heroic <b>Ray</b> was possibly Happy Terril, his father (he is shown wearing the costume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>Ray).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sampling. Along <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> {{sight that}} lies within the volume, {{equidistant}} sampling points or samples are selected. In general, the volume is not aligned with <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> sight, and sampling points will usually {{be located in}} between voxels. Because of that, {{it is necessary to}} interpolate the values of the samples from its surrounding voxels (commonly using trilinear interpolation).|$|R
25|$|Litter : Litter of {{all kinds}} is both {{unsightly}} and can cause pollution and damage to livestock and wild animals. Broken glass is a danger to people and, by focusing <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> <b>of</b> the sun, a possible cause of fire, particularly in areas of moorland such as Exmoor, parts of the Peak District and the North York Moors.|$|E

25|$|A {{plane mirror}} forms a virtual image {{positioned}} behind the mirror. Although <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> <b>of</b> light {{seem to come}} from behind the mirror, light from the source only exists {{in front of the}} mirror. The image in a plane mirror is not magnified (that is, the image is {{the same size as the}} object) and appears to be as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror.|$|E

25|$|It is {{believed}} that the axis of the temple was positioned by the ancient Egyptian architects {{in such a way}} that on October 22 and February 22, <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> <b>of</b> the sun would penetrate the sanctuary and illuminate the sculptures on the back wall, except for the statue of Ptah, a god connected with the Underworld, who always remained in the dark.

50|$|To render each such picture, a <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> sight (also {{called a}} {{projection}} line, projection <b>ray</b> or line <b>of</b> sight) towards {{the object is}} chosen, which determines on the object various points of interest (for instance, the points that are visible {{when looking at the}} object along <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> sight); those points of interest are mapped by an orthographic projection to points on some geometric plane (called a projection plane or image plane) that is perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> sight, thereby creating a 2D representation of the 3D object.|$|R
25|$|Architect Damon Lavelle from HOK Sport Venue Event (now Populous) {{designed}} the stadium {{to focus on}} light and transparency. Its polycarbonate roof allows <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> <b>of</b> sunlight to penetrate the stadium, thus illuminating it. The roof, which is supported by tie-beams of four steel arches, seems to float on the underlying tribunes. The arches measure 43 metres in height and help to define {{the look of the}} stadium after having been shaped to be similar to the wavy profile of the three tiers of the stadium.|$|E

It is famous for Vidyashankara Temple originally constructed by the Hoysalas and later completed by the founders of the Vijayanagar Empire and Sharada temple, an early 20th. century addition. In the Vidya Shankara shrine, there are 12 zodiac pillars, which are so constructed that <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> <b>of</b> the sun fall on the pillar corresponding to the month.|$|E
25|$|The hand {{may also}} relate to older traditions in various other {{religions}} in the Ancient Near East. In {{the art of}} the Amarna period in Egypt under Akhenaten, <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> <b>of</b> the Aten sun-disk end in small hands to suggest the bounty of the supreme deity. Like the hamsa amulet, the hand is sometimes shown alone on buildings, although {{it does not seem to}} have existed as a portable amulet-type object in Christian use.
