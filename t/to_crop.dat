The house mouse (Mus domesticus, Schwarz and Schwarz 1943) is a serious pest to agriculture in Australia. The impacts of house mouse damage <b>to</b> <b>crops</b> in Australia were examined. Plagues of mice (3 ̆e 1, 000 mice/ha) cause enormous economic and social stress to rural communities in Australia. The mouse plague in 1993 / 94 caused about US 60 million in damage <b>to</b> <b>crops,</b> intensive livestock industries, and rural communities. The impact of mouse plagues is generally well understood, but there is a dearth of knowledge about the relationship between mouse densities and the degree of mouse damage <b>to</b> particular <b>crops</b> types. This paper examines the relationships between the abundance estimates of mice and the damage they cause <b>to</b> <b>crops</b> at sowing and prior <b>to</b> harvest. <b>Crop</b> types examined were wheat, flood irrigated rice, irrigated soybean, and maize. Estimates of damage were obtained by counting the number of tillers (or pods) that were damaged by mice.

40|$|Developing a {{watermarking}} {{method that}} is robust <b>to</b> <b>cropping</b> attack is a challenging task in image watermarking. The moment-based watermarking schemes show good robustness to common signal processing attacks and some geometric attacks but are sensitive <b>to</b> <b>cropping</b> attack. In this paper, we modify the moment-based approach <b>to</b> deal with <b>cropping</b> attack. Firstly, {{we find the}} probability density function (pdf) of the pixel value distribution from the original image. Secondly, we reshape and normalize the pdf of the pixel value distribution (PPVD) to form a two dimensional image. Then, the moment invariants are calculated from the PPVD image. Since PPVD is insensitive <b>to</b> <b>cropping,</b> the proposed method is robust <b>to</b> <b>cropping</b> attack. Besides, it also has high robustness against other common attacks.

5|$|However, {{even though}} on a per-individual basis, many other species are {{actually}} more efficient at pollinating, on the 30% of crop types where honey bees are used, most native pollinators cannot be mass-utilized as easily or {{as effectively as}} honey bees—in many instances they will not visit the plants at all. Beehives can be moved from crop <b>to</b> <b>crop</b> as needed, and the bees will visit many plants in large numbers, compensating via saturation pollination for what they lack in efficiency. The commercial viability of these crops is therefore strongly tied to the beekeeping industry. In China, hand pollination of apple orchards is labor-intensive, time consuming, and costly.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{characteristic}} tusks, the cheek teeth of derived heterodontosaurids were also unique among early ornithischians.

Basal forms like Abrictosaurus had cheek teeth in both maxilla and dentary that were generally similar to other ornithischians: widely spaced, each having a low crown and a strongly-developed ridge (cingulum) separating the crown from the root. In more derived forms like Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus, the teeth were chisel-shaped, with much higher crowns and no cingula, so that there was no difference in width between the crowns and the roots.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{many other}} dinosaurs, psittacosaurs had akinetic skulls: {{that is to}} say, {{the upper and lower}} jaws each behaved as a single unit, without {{internal}} joints. The only joint was the jaw joint itself, and psittacosaurs could slide their lower jaws forward and backward on the joint, permitting a shearing action. Unlike most ceratopsians, their beaks did not form curved tips, but were instead rounded and flattened. If the jaws were aligned, the beaks could be used <b>to</b> <b>crop</b> objects, but if the lower jaw was retracted so that the lower beak was inside the upper beak, the jaws may have served a nutcracking function. A nut- or seed-rich diet would also match well with the gastroliths often seen in well-preserved psittacosaur skeletons.|$|E

5|$|The Mikea {{live in a}} {{symbiotic}} relationship with the neighboring Masikoro farmers and herders, and the Vezo fishing clan. The Mikea live primarily on food scavenged from the forest but also grow seasonal crops. Their mobility and reliance on scavenging as opposed <b>to</b> <b>crop</b> growing shifts in response to changes in environmental and economic pressures on availability of resources within the Mikea {{community as well as}} those of their Vezo and Masikoro neighbors. The Mikea sell their forest products, as well as woven mats and food animals they raise, at weekly Vezo and Masikoro markets in nearby villages to obtain the necessities they cannot scavenge, such as clothing and medicine. Some Mikea migrate for periods of time to work in local villages or the town of Morombe. They are also hired to work for Vezo and Masikoro villagers, such as by cutting forest for villagers or other Mikeas' corn fields, or guarding villagers' zebu herds. They occasionally acquire one or more zebu in addition to or in lieu of payment, as these are seen as a form of wealth and are mainly sacrificed in ancestral ceremonies rather than eaten as food. The rainy season is the time when Mikea are most likely to leave their scavenging encampments for wage labor opportunities in villages or for the corn harvest. This is also the time when Masikoro and Vezo villagers are most likely to move into the forest to grow corn.|$|E

40|$|The Borana {{people are}} the {{predominant}} ethnic group on the Borana Plateau in southern Ethiopia. Though traditionally transhumant pastoralists, they have recently increased their reliance on crops. Rainfall in the region averages between 353 mm to 873 mm; variability in rainfall is quite high, with coefficients of variation ranging from. 21 to. 68. The past decade has witnessed {{a dramatic increase in}} land allocated <b>to</b> <b>crops,</b> and land in pastures that are either becoming privatised, or accessible to only a small sub-group of people. In this paper, we derive an empirical model of stocking rates and land allocation, which is then used to estimate the effects of exogenous parameters on stocking densities, land allocated <b>to</b> <b>crops,</b> and land allocated to private pastures. Results indicate the following: a) regions with high coefficients of variation in rainfall have lower livestock densities and less land allocated <b>to</b> <b>crops,</b> b) communities with greater numbers of households and higher population densities have larger indices of non-cooperation, higher stock densities, and more land allocated <b>to</b> <b>crops,</b> c) heterogeneity within a community, measured by the distribution of wealth levels, is positively related to an index of non-cooperation, and to higher stock densities, d) higher relative prices of livestock and shorter distances to market are associated with greater stock densities as well as greater land allocated <b>to</b> <b>crops,</b> e) the greater is mobility into an area, the higher are stock densities, and the lower is the cooperation level, whereas outward mobility by community members has no effect on either stock densities or the level of cooperation reached, f) the proportion of members engaged in wage work outside has a significant negative effect on the ability of the community to cooperate. Outside wage work also increases land allocated <b>to</b> <b>crops,</b> but has a significant negative effect on land allocated to private pastures, and g) the greater is the index of non-cooperation, the higher are stock densities and the greater is land allocated <b>to</b> <b>crops.</b> ...|$|R
