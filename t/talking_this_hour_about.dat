Counting from September 1989, the picture material was waiting for <b>this</b> <b>hour</b> for <b>about</b> 16 years. For as many years they waited on the mezzanines of the publication of Kharms's manuscript after his death in 1942, while Yakov Druskin did not start publishing them.|$|R

50|$|Once {{the route}} was selected, the code was typewriten {{onto the front}} of the letter, {{typically}} in colored ink printed 90 degrees to the written address. The letter then dropped through the sorting station into a row of spinning wheels that propelled the letter through the bin area. Mechanical shutters, activated by the same keypad entries, opened to allow the letter to drop through into the bins. The bins were much larger than a typical pigeon hole, reducing the number of collections. In full operation, the 5/300 Transorma could sort 15,000 letters per <b>hour.</b> <b>This</b> was <b>about</b> double the rate that the same number of clerks could sort by hand.|$|R

In non-peak <b>hours</b> <b>this</b> is <b>about</b> 15 mts, in peak time it is 10 mts and around noon it is two hours. The energy from sun is cumulative at the end of the period and for an average sunny day it is about 72 kWh from 18 kW panels (the rest is for auxiliary systems and charges a different battery bank). The battery state of charge (SOC) is shown at the beginning of trip and end of trip. At the end of the day, the battery has about 20% charge left. The energy use can be further optimised by adding one more trip (5 kWh usage) so that end of day battery SOC can be 10%.On a bright sunny day, the no. of trips can be increased by taking trips during 11:55 to 14:05 break. About four more trips can be made in this period.|$|R
