5|$|Malware {{blocking}} {{and removal}} garnered good results in PC Magazine testing. All but one malware samples contained within a folder were removed once <b>the</b> <b>folder</b> was opened. The last one was removed when executed. Modifications {{made to the}} samples did not affect detection. On a similar test, specifically using commercial keyloggers, Norton did not successfully detect all. In removing threats, Norton almost completely removed 40 percent of the malware samples and related executables. Norton was also able to remove more commercial keyloggers than any other product.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, D.C., Agent Fox Mulder appears {{before an}} FBI panel {{regarding}} {{his experiences in}} Antarctica. Meanwhile, The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) reports to the Syndicate on the alien in Phoenix, confident that he'll be able to kill it. Assistant Director Walter Skinner tells Mulder, {{who is working on}} restoring the burned X-Files, that Mulder and Scully have been denied reassignment on the X-Files, but that Mulder should seek out a folder left on the desk in his old office. Mulder goes there, only to discover that Jeffrey Spender and Diana Fowley have been assigned to the X-Files. Feeling betrayed by Fowley, Mulder leaves, but not before stealthily taking <b>the</b> <b>folder</b> with him.|$|E

50|$|In System 7.1, a {{separate}} Fonts <b>folder</b> appeared in <b>the</b> System <b>Folder.</b> Fonts were automatically installed when dropped on <b>the</b> System <b>Folder,</b> and became available to applications {{after they were}} restarted. Font resources were generally grouped together in suitcase files. However, rules for storing printer fonts varied greatly between different system, printer and application configurations until the advent of <b>the</b> new Fonts <b>folder.</b> Typically, {{they had to be}} stored directly in <b>the</b> System <b>Folder</b> or in <b>the</b> Extensions <b>Folder.</b>|$|R

25|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{after arriving in}} 1931, she met Edgar Snow, who had arrived in China in 1929. Ed was ready to return to America at this point as his mother had died and he was battling malaria. But meeting Helen convinced him to stay working in China. She was {{a big fan of}} his work, having collected all of his newspaper clippings. Upon their first meeting, Helen gave Edgar <b>the</b> <b>folder</b> of newspaper clippings, impressing him greatly. Helen wanted her career to emulate his.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} ability to save {{searches}} as a Search Folder where opening <b>the</b> <b>folder</b> will execute a specific search automatically and display the results as a normal folder. A search folder is just an XML file which stores the search query, including the search operators as well. When these files are accessed, the search is run with the saved query string and the results presented as a virtual folder. Windows Vista also supports query composition, where a saved search (called a scope) can be nested within the query string of another search.|$|E
25|$|Windows Explorer's task {{panel has}} been removed, {{integrating}} the relevant task options into the toolbar. A Favorites pane {{on the left}} contains commonly accessed folders and prepopulated Search Folders. Seven different views are available to view files and folders, namely, List, Details, Small icons, Medium icons, Large icons, Extra large icons or Tiles. File and folder actions such as Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, Delete, Rename and Properties are built into a dropdown menu which appears when the Organize button is clicked. It is also possible to change {{the layout of the}} Explorer window by using the Organize button. Users can select whether to display Classic Menus, a Search Pane, a Preview Pane, a Reading Pane, and/or the Navigation Pane. Document Properties are available from the common 'Open' and 'Save' dialog boxes, so it is easier to add metadata (such as author or subject) to a document. The metadata can be viewed and edited in the Details Pane that shows up at the bottom of an Explorer window. The Navigation Pane contains a list of most common folders (the Favorites) for quick navigation. It can also show <b>the</b> <b>folder</b> layout of the entire hard drive or a subset of it. It can contain both real folders as well as virtual ones. By default it contains links to folders such as Documents and the publicly shared folder, as well as virtual folders that search and present the saved virtual folders and that lists the recently changed documents. The Preview Pane can be used to preview the contents of a document, including viewing pictures in a size larger than the thumbnails shown in <b>the</b> <b>folder</b> listing, and sampling contents of a media file, without opening any additional program. Explorer can show a preview for any image format if the necessary codec authored using the Windows Imaging Component is installed. Also, if an application installs Preview handlers (like Office 2007 does), then the documents can be edited in the preview pane itself.|$|E
50|$|Another {{commonly}} used <b>folder</b> type is <b>the</b> hanging <b>folder,</b> which has hooks {{on all four}} corners that slide over a rail. Normally, hanging folders are used to file one or more manila folders, {{and it is not}} a common practice to put loose sheets directly into hanging folders. When some documents need to be retrieved, <b>the</b> corresponding manila <b>folder(s)</b> are removed from <b>the</b> hanging <b>folder.</b> <b>The</b> hanging <b>folder</b> itself is left in its place on the rails.|$|R
5000|$|Tree {{traversal}} - Where {{a folder}} is opened {{and inside the}} display of that folder are further sub-folders. <b>The</b> <b>folders</b> are searched in a specific order, exactly once, in a systematic manner. This tree traversal approach relies on <b>the</b> naming of <b>folders</b> to provide a rich enough indication {{as to what is}} contained in <b>the</b> next <b>folder</b> or level of folders.|$|R

25|$|Hermes was recommissioned on 7 May {{and loaded}} two unknown {{aircraft}} on 5 July, making nine flights with them before 14 July. For the trials she initially used a Borel Bo.11 and a Short Folder, but the Borel was damaged {{in a storm}} and replaced by a Caudron G.2 amphibian. This latter aircraft took off successfully while the ship was moving on 28 July, but the take-off platform only {{seems to have been}} used twice during this time. During the manoeuvers, she simulated a reconnaissance Zeppelin for the Red Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral John Jellicoe. <b>The</b> <b>Folder</b> could only a small wireless transmitter because of weight limits and it would be launched to search for search for enemy ships and report back to Hermes which would retransmit its message with its more powerful transmitter. The aircraft made a total of about 30 flight before 6 October. The tests showed that aircraft required radio transmitters to usefully perform reconnaissance, that sustained use of aircraft at sea was possible and that handling aircraft aboard ship and on the sea imposed their own set of requirements that could not be met by converted land-based aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major change}} to the Start menu in Windows Vista is {{that it no longer}} {{presents}} the All programs menu as a horizontally expanding cascading list which utilizes the entire screen space, but instead as a nested folder view with a fixed size. The list of submenus and single items appears over the left column contents with a Back button below it. Subfolders expand and collapse vertically within the list when single-clicked, in a tree-like fashion similar to Windows Explorer. Single items appear at the top and folders appear at the bottom. Hovering the mouse over a folder does not open it; <b>the</b> <b>folder</b> needs to be clicked. A limitation of the new Start menu is that subfolders inside the All Programs menu cannot be opened simply by searching or double clicking. Also, as more programs are installed, a vertical scroll bar appears between the two columns. A dynamically changing icon showing the user's display picture by default is present {{at the top of the}} right column. It changes as users hover over any other item to reflect that item's icon. The Power button's action is configurable through Power options in the Control Panel, though the default setting is to put the computer into Sleep mode. Users can quickly lock their user account by pressing the Lock button. Additional power and account related actions are listed in a sub-menu which appears when the small arrow next to the Lock button is clicked.|$|E
500|$|Strom {{was not an}} {{effective}} speaker and often would {{not look at the}} text of his speeches until he was delivering them. [...] Realizing this, Hamilton once handed him a folder with nothing but a paper reading [...] "Sock it to 'em, Harry" [...] before the Premier was to give a speech at the University of Alberta. [...] The Premier opened <b>the</b> <b>folder</b> and, as he became visibly alarmed, gratefully received the real speech when an aide brought it to him.|$|E
50|$|Using folders, items {{scheduled}} for the current month are placed within <b>the</b> appropriate daily <b>folder.</b> Items which {{need to be done}} in a future month are placed in <b>the</b> corresponding monthly <b>folder.</b> Every day, <b>the</b> current daily <b>folder</b> is emptied and placed {{at the back of the}} set.

500|$|The Mega Buster {{is quite}} weak on its own, {{so in order}} to delete viruses more efficiently, the player must access special {{abilities}} called [...] "Battle Chips". These are minor programs that contain data that the Navi can utilize to perform more powerful attacks, summon other Navis for help, or execute supportive actions such as restoring HP or destroying tiles on the enemies' side of the battlefield. Battle Chips are uploaded to MegaMan.EXE by Lan's PET in a process called [...] "Customization." [...] Each turn in battle presents the player with five random chips from which to choose, though the player is limited to chips of the same variety or chips with the same alphabetic code. Once the [...] "Battle Gauge" [...] (or [...] "Custom Gauge") {{at the top of the}} screen fills during battle, another random set of chips can be chosen from a general pool called the [...] "folder". At any given time, the player may only have exactly 30 chips in <b>the</b> <b>folder</b> from which the Customization process may draw. The player is only allowed to carry up to ten of the same kind of chip and up to five Navi-summon chips in <b>the</b> <b>folder.</b> However, a player may possess any number of other chips in inactive reserve, called the [...] "sack", which may be moved to the active folder outside of battle. Every chip and enemy is aligned to one of five elements: Neutral, Fire, Water, Electric, and Wood. If MegaMan.EXE hits an enemy with an attack aligned to an element they are weak against, the attack will do double damage.|$|E
500|$|Several {{incidents}} hindered {{the production}} of the episode. The prop department for The X-Files initially made a fake ransom note for the scene wherein Mrs. LaPierre automatically writes the kidnappers message. A crew member for the show later took the note, along with a folder of other documents to one of the filming locations. Before arriving at the location, he stopped {{to make a phone call}} from a pay phone. A person, however, was watching him from their house and, being suspicious, called the police. Unfortunately for the crew member, he left <b>the</b> <b>folder</b> and note, which included the line [...] "Don't do anything or we'll kill your baby" [...] at the booth. When the individual went back to retrieve the note, he was promptly arrested. Director Kim Manners later called the situation a [...] "mess".|$|E
500|$|One year later, Sally and Larry {{have opened}} a {{combined}} book and DVD store. Sally insists on keeping a folder of the events, including Larry's completed transcript, but Larry {{wants her to}} move on and indicates he has feelings for her. Sally gently rebuffs him and Larry steps out on an errand. Sally sees the Doctor and Martha hurriedly leave a taxi in front of the shop and goes outside to meet them. They don't recognise her and she realises that they have yet to experience the events that sent them to the past. She hands the Doctor <b>the</b> <b>folder,</b> warning him that he will need it in his future. The Doctor and Sally say goodbye as Larry returns, surprised to see the man from the Easter egg. Sally and Larry return to the shop hand in hand, hinting that she is now ready for a romantic relationship. The episode ends with a repeat of the Doctor's [...] "don't blink" [...] warning to Sally, this time directed at the viewer and overlaid with flashes of famous statues.|$|E
5000|$|The user's Desktop is {{a special}} folder that resides {{at the root of}} the Shell namespace. Although this folder maps by default to a {{physical}} <b>folder</b> stored in <b>the</b> user's profile <b>folder,</b> <b>the</b> special desktop <b>folder</b> is represented as a distinct object from <b>the</b> physical desktop <b>folder.</b> <b>The</b> same holds true with the [...] "My Documents" [...] (Windows 95 through XP) or user [...] "Documents" [...] (Windows Vista+) folder.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} {{visually}} representing hierarchy {{is through the}} Nested clusters. The Nested clusters represents hierarchical relationships by using layers of information. The child element is within the parent element, such as in a Venn diagram. This structure of representing hierarchy is most effective in representing simple relationships. For example, when directing someone to open a file on a computer desktop, one may first direct them towards <b>the</b> main <b>folder,</b> then <b>the</b> subfolders within <b>the</b> main <b>folder.</b> They will keep opening files within <b>the</b> <b>folders</b> until <b>the</b> designated file is located.|$|R
25|$|A non-{{administrator}} {{user can}} share only <b>the</b> <b>folders</b> under his user profile. In addition, all users have a Public folder which is shared, though an administrator can override this.|$|R
2500|$|A {{more secure}} fashion to edit the file {{is to use}} the bootcfg command from a console. bootcfg will also relock the file (setting the file back to system, hidden, and read-only). Additionally, the file can be edited within Windows using a text editor if <b>the</b> <b>folder</b> view option [...] "Show hidden files and folders" [...] is selected, <b>the</b> <b>folder</b> view option [...] "Hide {{protected}} operating system files" [...] is unchecked, and the [...] "Read-only" [...] option is unchecked under file properties.|$|E
2500|$|In Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, <b>the</b> <b>folder</b> {{is located}} in [...] "%userprofile%\Start Menu" [...] for {{individual}} users, or [...] "%allusersprofile%\Start Menu" [...] for shared shortcuts.|$|E
2500|$|Pidgin {{supports}} file transfers {{for many}} protocols. It lacks some protocol-specific features like <b>the</b> <b>folder</b> sharing available from Yahoo. [...] Direct, peer-to-peer file transfers are supported over protocols such as XMPP and MSN.|$|E
50|$|Fonts in <b>the</b> /System/Library/Fonts <b>folder</b> and <b>the</b> /Library/Fonts <b>folder</b> are {{available}} to all users.

Those fonts are also made available to native macOS applications.|$|R
50|$|Not all {{standard}} applications support reparse points. Most noticeably, Backup {{suffers from}} {{this problem and}} will issue an error message 0x80070003 when <b>the</b> <b>folders</b> to be backed up contain a reparse point.|$|R
50|$|Step {{one is to}} {{retrieve}} the XooML fragment for the window's anchor URI and synchronize its metadata as needed with the item pointed to by the URI. The current version of Planz, for example, places XooML fragments in association with file folders {{in order to support}} <b>the</b> use of <b>folder</b> structure as a means of organizing not only files but also e-mail messages, web references and informal notes. In a step of synchronization, <b>the</b> <b>folder's</b> contents (as determined by file system calls) are compared to the information in <b>the</b> <b>folder's</b> associated XooML fragment. In cases of conflict, the fragment is modified to agree with the file system (i.e., the file system always wins). From the top-level synchronized XooML fragment, Planz builds a top-level Plan.|$|R

In the experiment, Milgram sent several packages to 160 random people living in Omaha, Nebraska, asking them to forward the package to a friend or acquaintance who they thought would bring the package closer to a set final individual, a stockbroker from Boston, Massachusetts. Each [...] "starter" [...] received instructions to mail a folder via the U.S. Post Office to a recipient, but with some rules. Starters could only mail <b>the</b> <b>folder</b> to someone they actually knew personally on a first-name basis. When doing so, each starter instructed their recipient to mail <b>the</b> <b>folder</b> ahead {{to one of the}} latter's first-name acquaintances with the same instructions, with the hope that their acquaintance might by some chance know the target recipient.|$|E
5000|$|Dock icons for [...] "Folder" [...] stacks {{that are}} often {{misleading}} because Stacks build icons from folder contents and do not allow for custom icons to be applied by the user. For example, a user's Home <b>folder</b> shows <b>the</b> Applications <b>folder</b> (or if that {{does not exist in}} Home <b>folder,</b> <b>the</b> Desktop <b>folder),</b> while <b>the</b> Photos <b>folder</b> is just a [...] "stack" [...] of plain blue folders created by iPhoto. However, this was addressed with OS 10.5.2: you can now choose to represent a stack with its original Folder icon, as displayed in Finder.|$|R
