40|$|I {{propose a}} new method to {{attenuate}} specularly-reflected <b>multiples</b> in <b>the</b> image space. The method {{is based on}} the difference in mapping between primaries and multiples in Subsurface Offset Domain Common Image Gathers (SODCIGs). I migrate the data with a velocity slower than that of the primaries but faster than that of <b>the</b> <b>multiples.</b> <b>The</b> primaries are therefore undermigrated whereas <b>the</b> <b>multiples</b> are overmigrated. For positive data offsets, the primaries are mapped to positive subsurface offsets and <b>the</b> <b>multiples</b> to negative subsurface offsets in SODCIGs. I then apply a tapered mute to eliminate the primaries and do adjoint migration on <b>the</b> <b>multiples</b> with <b>the</b> same velocity model to get an estimate of <b>the</b> <b>multiples</b> in data space. Similarly, a tapered mute is applied to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>multiples</b> and adjoint migration used to obtain an estimate of the primaries in data space. The estimate of <b>the</b> <b>multiples</b> is adaptively matched to the data with the estimate of the primaries used as a weight function to prevent matching the primaries. I illustrate the method with a 2 D synthetic dataset and show that the primaries can be well recovered although some residual from <b>the</b> water bottom <b>multiple</b> remains...|$|R

For <b>the</b> <b>multiples,</b> however, this difference may be large and correcting for ray bending produces a better approximation that leads to better focusing of <b>the</b> <b>multiples</b> in <b>the</b> Radon domain.
