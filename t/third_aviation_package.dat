40|$|The author {{describes}} {{the beginnings of}} Polish medical aviation. The Medevac {{is very important for}} the effective treatment of the majority of patients. Aeroplanes, because of their speed, are the best transportation means for patients in very serious conditions. The beginnings of Polish medical aviation took place soon after the Great War. Colonel Doctor Felicjan Sławoj-Składkowski (Head of Health Service at the Department of Military Affairs) was a great follower of this idea. The first medical flight took place on August 14, 1924 in Poznań in the <b>Third</b> <b>Aviation</b> Regiment. Initially, Polish military aviation was associated with the military, now it is a popular transportation means in civil medical emergency services too. Andrzej Grzybowsk...|$|R

5|$|The very {{expensive}} project of 1910, costing Coandă about one million francs, {{left him with}} limited funds. The possibility of a new contract with the French government led Coandă to build the Coandă-1911. He wished to win an army-organised competition at Reims in October, one that required two engines in each aircraft as a fail-safe strategy. At the <b>third</b> <b>aviation</b> salon in Paris 1911, Coandă displayed a scale model of the aircraft which used two Gnome rotary engines mounted back to back, connected by a bevel gear to a single two-bladed propeller. The combination of two engines connected to one propeller was originally intended to drive a new turbine, but Coandă was unable to fund one. During trials the assembly did not provide enough traction and a four-bladed propeller was ordered. The mounting support of the engines, initially intended for a jet propulsion version, was not adequate for the new configuration so the forward chassis had to be modified.|$|R

6000|$|It was Carl's <b>third</b> <b>aviation</b> event. A neat, {{though not}} {{imposing}} figure, in a snug blue flannel suit, with his cap turned round on his head, {{he went to}} the flap of the rickety tent which served as his hangar. A fierce cry of [...] "Fly! Fly! Why don't he fly?" [...] was coming from the long black lines edging the track, and from the mound of people on the small grand stand; the pink blur of their faces turned toward him--him, Carl Ericson; all of them demanding him! The five meek police of Onamwaska were trotting back and forth, keeping them behind the barriers. Carl was apprehensive lest this ten-thousandfold demand drag him out, make him fly, despite a wind that was blowing the flags out straight, and whisking up the litter of newspapers and cracker-jack boxes and pink programs. While he stared out, an official crossing the track fairly leaned up against the wind, which seized his hat and sailed it {{to the end of the}} track.|$|R
40|$|Massey University School of Aviation {{is pleased}} to {{announce}} the <b>third</b> <b>Aviation</b> Education and Research Symposium {{to be held at}} Wellington on 05 - 06 July 2010, in conjunction with the Aviation Industry Association of New Zealand and Royal Aeronautical Society, New Zealand. Encouraged by the success of the previous two seminars, we have continued with sessions that enable both academics and practitioners from the aviation industry to share views and developments. The event will be a venue for disseminating research, and an opportunity for theory and practice to converge. We have retained the same theme "Contemporary Issues in Aviation Education and Research", as this appears to attract a greater spectrum of submissions across aviation psychology, education, technology, training, and the economic aspects of the industry. The conference papers have been peer-reviewed and classified into three sessions, with ‘Aviation Training’ on the first day, followed by ‘Aviation Psychology’, ‘Aviation Education’ and ‘Commercial Aspects of Aviation’ on the following day. We welcome delegates to attend, participate and share information on the latest developments in the industry...|$|R
