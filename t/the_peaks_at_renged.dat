FT-IR spectra showed that activated carbon had the eight characteristic absorption of SS stretch, H 2 O stretch, OH stretch, CH stretch, conjugated CO stretch or CC stretch, CH 2 bend, CO stretch and acetylenic CH bend vibrations at 3850  cm– 1, 3740  cm– 1, 3430  cm– 1, 2920  cm– 1, 1630  cm– 1, 1390  cm– 1, 1110  cm– 1 and 600  cm– 1, respectively. For Na 2 SO 3, <b>the</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> 2920  cm– 1, 1630  cm– 1, 1390  cm– 1 and 1110  cm– 1 achieved the maximum at 20  min. For Na 2 S 2 O 8, <b>the</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> 3850  cm– 1, 3740  cm– 1 and 2920  cm– 1 achieved the maximum <b>at</b> 60  min. <b>The</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> 1390  cm– 1, 1110  cm– 1 and 600  cm– 1 achieved the maximum at 40  min. For Na 2 SO 4, <b>the</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> 3430  cm– 1, 2920  cm– 1, 1630  cm– 1, 1390  cm– 1, 1110  cm– 1 and 600  cm– 1 achieved the maximum at 60  min. For Fe 2 (SO 4) 3, <b>the</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> 1390  cm– 1, 1110  cm– 1 and 600  cm– 1 achieved the maximum at 20  min. For S, <b>the</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> 1630  cm– 1, 1390  cm– 1 and 600  cm– 1 achieved the maximum at 120  min. It provided that activated carbon could remove sulfur particles from smog air to restrain many anaphylactic diseases...|$|R
30|$|The FT-IR {{spectral}} {{features of}} Q. variabilis cork (Fig.  9) showed <b>the</b> typical <b>peak</b> {{characteristics of a}} suberin-containing material, namely <b>the</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> 2923 and 2852  cm− 1, corresponding to the CH 2 stretch absorption, and <b>the</b> sharp <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 1739  cm− 1 of the ester bonds present in suberin. Overall the spectrum was similar with those of corks of Q.|$|R
40|$|The photooxidative {{degradation}} of QTX (2 -hydroxy- 3 -(3, 4 -dimethyl- 9 -oxo- 9 H-thioxanthen- 2 -yloxy) -N,N,N-trimethyl- 1 -propanium chloride) {{has been investigated}} and photoproducts from QTX degradation in aqueous solution were characterized using HPLC/ESI-MS. The photooxidation of the dye was monitored by electronic absorption spectroscopy. The spectrum of the dye shows bands at 273 and 402 nm. During irradiation, the intensity of these bands decreases together {{with the appearance of}} a band at 310 - 340 nm, typical of oxidized QTX. The chromatograms show the presence of new peaks due to photoproducts of QTX degradation that were identified by mass spectroscopy. <b>The</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> m/z 388, 420 and 270 were attributed to photoproducts, whereas <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> m/z 372 is due to QTX. <b>The</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> m/z 388 corresponds to the formation of a sulfoxide group and that at m/z 420 suggested the formation of a sulfone with a hydroxyl on the methyl group. <b>The</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> m/z 270 suggests that oxygen reacts with QTX abstracting a hydrogen atom from the carbon bonded the hydroxyl, together with the release of the amino group...|$|R
