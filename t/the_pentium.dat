25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pentium</b> was {{designed}} to execute over 100 million instructions per second (MIPS), and the 75MHz model was able to reach 126.5 MIPS in certain benchmarks. <b>The</b> <b>Pentium</b> architecture typically offered just under twice {{the performance of a}} 486 processor per clock cycle in common benchmarks. The fastest 80486 parts (with slightly improved microarchitecture and 100MHz operation) were almost as powerful as the first-generation Pentiums, and the AMD Am5x86 was roughly equal to <b>the</b> <b>Pentium</b> 75 regarding pure ALU performance.|$|E
25|$|Four-input address-adders enables <b>the</b> <b>Pentium</b> {{to further}} reduce the address {{calculation}} latency {{compared to the}} 80486. <b>The</b> <b>Pentium</b> can calculate full addressing modes with segment-base + base-register + scaled register + immediate offset in a single cycle; the 486 has a three-input address-adder only, and must therefore divide such calculations between two cycles.|$|E

50|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>the</b> P5 <b>Pentium</b> caused many software developers to hand-optimize code in assembly language, {{to take advantage}} of <b>the</b> P5 <b>Pentium's</b> tightly pipelined and lower latency FPU. For example, the highly anticipated first person shooter Quake used highly optimized assembly code designed almost entirely around <b>the</b> P5 <b>Pentium's</b> FPU. As a result, <b>the</b> P5 <b>Pentium</b> significantly outperformed other CPUs in the game. Fortunately for the 6x86 (and AMD K6), many games continued to be integer-based throughout the chip's lifetime.|$|R
50|$|The event began Friday night, with a {{swap meet}} / social {{event at the}} Modern Lounge in Boston's Landsdowne Street nightclub district. Drink tickets were offered at the door, and the DJ played computer-themed music (e.g., It's All About <b>The</b> <b>Pentiums).</b>|$|R

25|$|While the Core {{microarchitecture}} {{is a major}} architectural revision it {{is based}} in part on <b>the</b> <b>Pentium</b> M processor family designed by Intel Israel. The Penryn pipeline is 12–14 stages long — less than half of Prescott's, a signature feature of wide order execution cores. Penryn's successor, Nehalem borrowed more heavily from <b>the</b> <b>Pentium</b> 4 and has 20-24 pipeline stages. Core's execution unit is 4 issues wide, compared to the 3-issue cores of P6, Pentium M, and 2-issue cores of NetBurst microarchitectures. The new architecture is a dual core design with linked L1 cache and shared L2 cache engineered for maximum performance per watt and improved scalability.|$|E
25|$|The AMD Athlon {{processor}} {{launched on}} June 23, 1999, with general availability by August '99. It launched at 500MHz and was, on average, 10% faster than <b>the</b> <b>Pentium</b> III {{at the same}} clock for Business applications, and even faster (~20%) for gaming workloads.|$|E
5000|$|Still, {{the later}} i815 was {{considered}} <b>the</b> best <b>Pentium</b> III chipset because it offered a better feature set and very similar performance {{relative to the}} 440BX. Not only did the i815 support a proper [...] "1/2" [...] AGP divider for the 133 MHz FSB clock rate, AGP 4x, and Ultra DMA 100, but the later revisions also directly supported <b>the</b> Tualatin <b>Pentium</b> III.|$|R

25|$|Outside of {{the desktop}} arena, however, the ARM {{architecture}} (RISC) is in widespread use in smartphones, tablets and {{many forms of}} embedded device. It {{is also the case}} that since <b>the</b> <b>Pentium</b> Pro (P6) Intel has been using an internal RISC processor core for its processors.|$|E
25|$|Much faster {{floating}} point unit. Some instructions showed an enormous improvement, most notably FMUL, {{with up to}} 15 times higher throughput than in the 80486 FPU. <b>The</b> <b>Pentium</b> is also able to execute a FXCH ST(x) instruction in parallel with an ordinary (arithmetical or load/store) FPU instruction.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pentium</b> was Intel's primary {{microprocessor}} {{for personal}} computers during the mid-1990s. The original design was reimplemented in newer processes and new features {{were added to}} maintain its competitiveness {{as well as to}} address specific markets such as portable computers. As a result, there were several variants of the P5 microarchitecture.|$|E

5000|$|The Intel 440BX is <b>the</b> third <b>Pentium</b> II chipset {{released}} by Intel, succeeding the 440FX and 440LX. With the new 100 MHz front side bus, Pentium II CPUs {{were able to}} scale better in performance by reducing the difference between processor clock and bus speed. The previous 66 MHz bus had become a serious bottleneck and dated back to <b>the</b> first <b>Pentium</b> [...] "Classic" [...] chipsets.|$|R
25|$|In mid-January 2006, Intel {{announced}} that they were dropping the long running Pentium name from their processors. <b>The</b> <b>Pentium</b> name was first {{used to refer to}} the P5 core Intel processors and was done to comply with court rulings that prevent the trademarking of a string of numbers, so competitors could not just call their processor the same name, as had been done with the prior 386 and 486 processors (both of which had copies manufactured by IBM and AMD). They phased out <b>the</b> <b>Pentium</b> names from mobile processors first, when the new Yonah chips, branded Core Solo and Core Duo, were released. The desktop processors changed when the Core 2 line of processors were released. By 2009, Intel was using a good-better-best strategy with Celeron being good, Pentium better, and the Intel Core family representing the best the company has to offer.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of Barton's release, the Northwood-based Pentium 4 had become more than {{competitive}} with AMD's processors. Unfortunately for AMD, a simple increase in size of the L2 cache to 512kB did not have nearly the same impact {{as it did for}} Intel's Pentium 4 line, as the Athlon architecture was not nearly as cache-constrained as <b>the</b> <b>Pentium</b> 4. The Athlon's exclusive-cache architecture and shorter pipeline made it less sensitive to L2 cache size, and the Barton only saw an increase of several percent gained in per-clock performance over the Thoroughbred-B it was derived from. While the increased performance was welcome, it was not sufficient to overtake <b>the</b> <b>Pentium</b> 4 line in overall performance. The PR also became somewhat inaccurate because some Barton models with lower clock rates were being given higher PR than higher-clocked Thoroughbred processors. Instances where a computational task did not benefit more from the additional cache {{to make up for the}} loss in raw clock speed created situations where a lower rated (but faster clocked) Thoroughbred would outperform a higher-rated (but lower clocked) Barton.|$|E
25|$|Separation of {{code and}} data caches lessens the fetch and operand read/write {{conflicts}} {{compared to the}} 486. To reduce access time and implementation cost, {{both of them are}} 2-way associative, instead of the single 4-way cache of the 486. A related enhancement in <b>the</b> <b>Pentium</b> is the ability to read a contiguous block from the code cache even when it is split between two cache lines (at least 17 bytes in worst case).|$|E
50|$|The agree {{predictor}} {{was used}} in the first version of <b>the</b> Intel <b>Pentium</b> 4, but was later abandoned.|$|R
50|$|Intel did not {{manufacture}} another integrated x86 {{processor until}} 2007, when it confirmed <b>the</b> Enhanced <b>Pentium</b> M-based Tolapai (EP80579).|$|R
50|$|On , 17 {{additional}} Broadwell laptop CPUs {{were launched}} for <b>the</b> Celeron, <b>Pentium</b> and Core i3, i5 and i7 series.|$|R
25|$|The Core {{microarchitecture}} {{returned to}} lower clock rates and improved {{the usage of}} both available clock cycles and power {{when compared with the}} preceding NetBurst microarchitecture of <b>the</b> <b>Pentium</b> 4/D-branded CPUs. The Core microarchitecture provides more efficient decoding stages, execution units, caches, and buses, reducing the power consumption of Core 2-branded CPUs while increasing their processing capacity. Intel's CPUs have varied widely in power consumption according to clock rate, architecture, and semiconductor process, shown in the CPU power dissipation tables.|$|E
25|$|The L1 {{cache size}} was {{enlarged}} in the Core microarchitecture, from 32KB on Pentium II/III (16KB L1 Data + 16KB L1 Instruction) to 64KB L1 cache/core (32KB L1 Data + 32KB L1 Instruction) on Pentium M and Core/Core 2. It also lacks an L3 Cache {{found in the}} Gallatin core of <b>the</b> <b>Pentium</b> 4 Extreme Edition, although an L3 Cache is present in high-end versions of Core-based Xeons. Both an L3 cache and Hyper-threading were reintroduced in the Nehalem microarchitecture.|$|E
25|$|Other {{changes to}} the core include a 6-stage {{pipeline}} (vs. 5 on P5) with a return stack (first done on Cyrix 6x86) and better parallelism, an improved instruction decoder, 32 KB L1 cache with 4-way associativity (vs. 16 KB with 2-way on P5), 4 write buffers that could now be used by either pipeline (vs. one corresponding to each pipeline on P5) and an improved branch predictor taken from <b>the</b> <b>Pentium</b> Pro, with a 512 entry buffer (vs. 256 on P5).|$|E
5000|$|Many designs include {{pipelines}} {{as long as}} 7, 10 {{and even}} 20 stages (as in <b>the</b> Intel <b>Pentium</b> 4).|$|R

25|$|The famous D♭ D♭ G♭ D♭ A♭ xylophone/xylomarimba jingle, sonic logo, tag, audio {{mnemonic}} {{was produced}} by Musikvergnuegen and written by Walter Werzowa, once {{a member of the}} Austrian 1980s sampling band Edelweiss. The sonic Intel logo was remade in 1999 to coincide with the launch of <b>the</b> <b>Pentium</b> III, and a second time in 2006 with the launch of the Core processors, with the melody unchanged. Advertisements for products featuring Intel processors with prominent MMX branding featured a version of the jingle with an embellishment after the final note.|$|E
25|$|The first Pentium {{microprocessor}} {{was introduced}} by Intel on March 22, 1993. Dubbed P5, its microarchitecture was the fifth generation for Intel, and the first superscalar IA-32 microarchitecture. As a direct extension of the 80486 architecture, it included dual integer pipelines, a faster floating-point unit, wider data bus, separate code and data caches and features for further reduced address calculation latency. In 1996, <b>the</b> <b>Pentium</b> with MMX Technology (often simply referred to as Pentium MMX) was introduced with the same basic microarchitecture complemented with an MMX instruction set, larger caches, and some other enhancements.|$|E
25|$|The Nintendo 64's central {{processing}} unit (CPU) is the NEC VR4300. Popular Electronics said it had power similar to <b>the</b> <b>Pentium</b> processors found in desktop computers. Except for its narrower 32-bit system bus, the VR4300 retained the computational abilities of the more powerful 64-bit MIPS R4300i, though software rarely took advantage of 64-bit data precision operations. Nintendo 64 games generally used faster (and more compact) 32-bit data-operations, as these were sufficient to generate 3D-scene data for the console's RSP (Reality Signal Processor) unit. In addition, 32-bit code executes faster and requires less storage space (which is at a premium on the Nintendo 64's cartridges).|$|E
