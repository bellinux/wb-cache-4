40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to investigate the relevance and efficiency of Yoruba gods in the administration of punishment and justices on crime commitment. Two Yoruba gods (Sango and Ogun) were principally chosen. Six hundred (600) participants were conveniently sampled from three localities from three geo-political states {{in the western part of}} Nigeria. Univariate and bivariate analyses were used in the description of the samples and frequency distribution tables were employed in the presentation of the data. The results show that Yoruba natives still fear and respect these gods. The gods are still relevant and efficient in the administration of punishment on crime commission. The Yoruba natives show preference for the non-conventional punishments of these gods to modern criminal justice systems. Finally, the paper recommends the opinion survey polls on the inclusion of <b>the</b> <b>invocations</b> of these gods in the criminal justice systems of Nigeria and the likely implementations of <b>the</b> <b>invocations</b> in official swearing in ceremony for political and public office holders and the administration of <b>the</b> <b>invocations</b> in Nigerian courts of law...|$|R

5|$|Although other {{contemporary}} vessels {{like the}} American North Carolina-class battleships carried 40.6cm main guns, the Bismarcks used 38-cm naval guns as the Germans had experience with them; a 40.6cm weapon {{would have had}} to have been designed from scratch. Bismarck was also authorized prior to the breakdown of the London Naval Treaty and <b>the</b> <b>invocation</b> of the 45,000-ton, 406mm main gun escalator clause (which the United States did invoke with the North Carolinas); building 40.6cm battleships would doubtless have seemed provocative, especially to the United Kingdom. As it was, the 38cm main battery of the Bismarck class compared well to their contemporaries, out-ranging most of the 38cm and 40.6cm guns of contemporary navies (with the exception of the Italian 38.1cm and French 38cm guns, of which the Italian gun suffered from exceptional bore erosion and the French gun from unusually poor accuracy).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Web {{service are}} the {{technology}} of a choice when developing business applications {{that needs to be}} loosely coupled, platform independent and capable to cross enterprise boundaries. The interactions that occur between web services need to be captured because such interactions would be very useful if captured using appropriate structures and analyzed for various purposes such as assessing the responsiveness of a web service to complete peer’s requests. Since <b>the</b> <b>invocations</b> of web services (WS) are dynamic, the behaviour of the WS will be dynamic depending on how <b>the</b> <b>invocations</b> discover, and get serviced by WSs. For this reason if the states of the behaviour of a WS can be captured and assessed, then tuning the WS and its performance improvement can be engineered at any stage. This work is presented in this paper...|$|R
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>invocation</b> and the {{performance}} of the United States National Anthem, the children of the late sports marketer Ed Shull gave the command for drivers to start their engines. On the pace laps, Johnson, after changing his engine, and teammate Earnhardt, who had to move to a back-up car, had to fall behind all the other drivers in the event after doing major changes during practice. At the start, Newman was the leader going through the first corner, but on the same lap Menard, with pushing assistance from Martin, passed him. On the second lap, the first caution was given because Newman spun sideways in the second turn but avoided impacting the wall. During the caution, he drove to pit road for a pit stop.|$|E
5|$|The Cylinder {{itself is}} part of a {{continuous}} Mesopotamian tradition of depositing a wide variety of symbolic items, including animal sacrifices, stone tablets, terracotta cones, cylinders and figures. Newly crowned kings of Babylon would make public declarations of their own righteousness when beginning their reigns, often in the form of declarations that were deposited in the foundations of public buildings. Some contained messages, while others did not, and they had a number of purposes: elaboration of a building's value, commemoration of the ruler or builder and the magical sanctification of the building, through <b>the</b> <b>invocation</b> of divine protection.|$|E

5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words they could find. Every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight. <b>The</b> <b>invocation</b> with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, dazzled by the glaze and blinded by the smoke, in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the title}} of the episode and <b>the</b> <b>invocation</b> spoken by the {{character}} of Sammael refer to four of the nine choirs of angels in Christian mythology. Christian angelology holds that there are three groupings of three choirs each. The Thrones are the third-highest ranking choir, belonging to the group charged with attending to God, and are described as stern incarnations of holy justice. Dominions, the fourth-highest choir, belong to the group appointed to deal with God's creations. Dominions lead the lower orders and impart wisdom to humanity. Powers belong to the same tier as Dominions, and are tasked with countering the threat of temptation by the devil and demons. Principalities are the seventh-highest ranking choir and belong to the lowest grouping of angels, those most likely to appear to mankind. Principalities oversee those humans who rule over others, teaching kings and heads of families the skills needed to lead.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>invocation</b> and the {{performance}} of the National Anthem, three-time Olympic gold medalist swimmer Ryan Lochte commanded the drivers to start their engines. Edwards maintained his pole position lead going into the first corner with Earnhardt, Jr. in second. On lap two, Tony Stewart passed Edwards around the outside to take the lead. Edwards, with assistance from Bayne, moved in front of Stewart going into turn three to reclaim the first position two laps later. On the fifth lap, Earnhardt moved into the lead and Ambrose moved into second place. Edwards temporarily moved back into first before Earnhardt reclaimed the position. Bayne, who also battled for the lead, had moved down the field by lap seven. On lap nine, Michael McDowell made contact with David Gilliland's left-rear quarter panel between turns one and two; Gilliland went up the track towards the outside wall, and collected Menard and Montoya, triggering the first caution of the race and the appearance of the pace car. Keselowski was also caught up in the wreckage and his car sustained minor damage. Most of the drivers, including Earnhardt, made pit stops for fuel. Earnhardt was required to make an additional pit stop after one of his pit crew went over the wall too soon, dropping him down the field.|$|E

5|$|When he was twelve, Parsons began {{attending}} Washington Junior High School, {{where he}} performed poorly—something biographer George Pendle attributed to undiagnosed dyslexia—and was bullied for his upper-class status and perceived effeminacy. Although unpopular, he formed a strong friendship with Edward Forman, a boy {{from a poor}} working-class family who defended him from bullies and shared his interest in science fiction and rocketry, with the well-read Parsons enthralling Forman with his literary prowess. In 1928 the pair—adopting the Latin motto per aspera ad astra (through hardship to the stars)—began engaging in homemade gunpowder-based rocket experiments in the nearby Arroyo Seco canyon, {{as well as the}} Parsons family's back garden, which left it pockmarked with craters from explosive test failures. They incorporated commonly available fireworks such as cherry bombs into their rockets, and Parsons suggested using glue as a binding agent to increase the rocket fuel's stability. This research became more complex when they began using materials such as aluminium foil to make the gunpowder easier to cast. Parsons had also begun to investigate occultism, and performed a ritual intended to invoke the Devil into his bedroom; he worried that <b>the</b> <b>invocation</b> was successful and was frightened into ceasing these activities. In 1929 he began attending John Muir High School, where he maintained an insular friendship with Forman and was a keen participant in fencing and archery. After he received poor school results, Parsons' mother sent him away to study at a private boarding school in San Diego—the Brown Military Academy for Boys—but he was expelled for blowing up the toilets.|$|E
