5|$|During Commando Hunt V (10 October 1970 to 30 April 1971) Air Force {{intelligence}} claimed 16,266 trucks {{destroyed and}} another 7,700 damaged {{during the dry}} season offensive. The Seventh Air Force headquarters in Saigon, chagrined by <b>the</b> <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the figures, recomputed them and lowered the estimate to 11,000 destroyed and 8,000 damaged. In fact, there were only 2,500–3,000 PAVN trucks operating on the trail during 1970–1971, each carrying approximately four tons of materiel.|$|E
5|$|I can't complain...Exile {{brought out}} in me, in {{addition}} to a revulsion against violence and against depreciation of the human condition, a feeling for the universality of man.

5|$|To {{finance the}} war, the Confederate {{government}} initially issued bonds, but investment {{from the public}} never met the demands. Taxes were lower than in the Union and collected with less efficiency; European investment was also insufficient. As the war proceeded, both the Confederate government and the individual states printed more and more paper money. Inflation increased from 60% in 1861 to 300% in 1863 and 600% in 1864. Davis {{did not seem to}} grasp <b>the</b> <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the problem.|$|E

5|$|British Railways {{undertook}} a massive programme to establish itself by repainting all its locomotives {{with their new}} BR numbers and replacing their previous corporate identity with its own. Gone were the tenders proclaiming the railway companies' logos, emblems and even coats of arms, {{to be replaced by}} the stark 'BRITISH RAILWAYS' lettering. <b>The</b> <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> this task meant that the necessary repainting was not necessarily carried out to coincide with an overall repaint. For the Coronation Class, all locomotives had been through this process by the end of 1948 except for Nos. 6223, 6238, 6248, 6250, and 6252–6255, a total of 29 locomotives. Only thirteen locomotives out of the 29 received new liveries to accompany their renumbering.|$|E
5|$|The {{event was}} to have been {{sponsored}} by American Express, however they backed out at the last moment failing to come to terms regarding ArtRave's production. Gaga performed a concert which was streamed live on Vevo and later rebroadcast through the website's syndication partners. The set list consisted of songs from Artpop. On November 11, Clear Channel aired a half-hour special called Album Release Party with Lady Gaga, hosted by Ryan Seacrest on more than 150 radio stations throughout the United States. On November 19, The CW aired a television special with footage from the album release party. ArtRave received generally positive reviews from critics who noted <b>the</b> <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the production, as well as Gaga's performance and enthusiasm; the launch of Volantis was generally criticised.|$|E
5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly {{would have known that}} even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp <b>the</b> <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E

In 1877, before being executed by firing squad at Mountain Meadows on March 23, 1877, Lee professed that he was a scapegoat for others involved.

25|$|The commonest of all {{penalties}} was a fine.

25|$|If {{the offer}} was refused, however, the Mongols would invade and destroy the city or town, but allow a few civilians to flee and spread terror by {{reporting}} their loss. These reports were an essential tool to incite fear in others. However, both sides often had a similar if differently motivated interest in overstating <b>the</b> <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the reported events: the Mongols' reputation would increase and the townspeople could use their reports of terror to raise an army. For that reason, specific data (e.g. casualty figures) given in contemporary sources needs to be evaluated carefully.|$|E

60|$|The {{struggle}} with America ceased {{about the time}} of Lord Cadurcis' last visit to Cherbury, when, from his indignant lips, Venetia first learnt <b>the</b> <b>enormities</b> <b>of</b> her father's career. Since that period some three years had elapsed until we introduced our readers to the boudoir of Lady Monteagle. During this period, among the Whigs and their partisans the literary fame of Herbert had arisen and become established. How they have passed in regard to Lady Annabel Herbert and her daughter, on the one hand, and Lord Cadurcis himself on the other, we will endeavour to ascertain in the following chapter.|$|R
25|$|As MacKenzie's layout {{was seen}} by more and more people, a {{collective}} shudder ran through the office (but) MacKenzie's dominance was so total there was nobody left in the organisation who could rein him in except Murdoch. (Everyone in the office) seemed paralysed—"looking like rabbits in the headlights"—as one hack described them. The error staring them in the face was too glaring. It obviously wasn't a silly mistake; nor was it a simple oversight. Nobody really had any comment on it—they just took one look and went away shaking their heads in wonder at <b>the</b> <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> it. It was a 'classic smear'.|$|E
25|$|Staff {{meetings}} were always held on Fridays in the Astronaut Office {{and it was}} here that Collins found himself on January 27, 1967. Don Gregory was running the meeting in the absence of Alan Shepard and so it was he who answered the red phone to be informed that there was a fire in the Apollo 1 CM. When <b>the</b> <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the situation was ascertained, it fell on Collins to go the Chaffee household to tell Martha Chaffee that her husband was dead. The Astronaut Office had learned to be proactive in informing astronauts' families of a death quickly, because of the death of Theodore Freeman in an aircraft crash, when a newspaper reporter was the first to his house.|$|E
25|$|Nuit et Brouillard (Night and Fog, 1955) {{was one of}} {{the first}} documentaries about the Nazi {{concentration}} camps, but it deals more with the memory of the camps than with their actual past existence. Realising that standard documentary techniques would be incapable of confronting <b>the</b> <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the horror (and even risked humanising it), Resnais chose to use a distancing technique by alternating historical black-and-white images of the camps with contemporary colour footage of the sites in long tracking shots. The accompanying narration (written by Jean Cayrol, himself a survivor of the camps) was intentionally understated to add to the distancing effect. Although the film encountered censorship problems with the French government, its impact was immense and it remains one of the director's most admired works.|$|E

25|$|Kandukuri Veeresalingam is {{reckoned}} as {{the chief}} architect of the Renaissance of Telugu literature in the later {{half of the nineteenth}} century. But due to <b>the</b> <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> his service as a social reformer in comparison with that of his work as a pioneer in modern Telugu literature, he is looked upon by the people as a reformer. As a writer, {{he was the first to}} try his hand at many of the modern literary forms such as minor poem, burlesque, biography, autobiography, novel, satire, farce and plays. If Veeresalingam was the path-finder in this respect, Chilakamarti was a torch-bearer along the path, as the former went on breaking new grounds. Both of them were versatile writers in verse and as well as in prose. The literary output of both of them was conspicuously voluminous. There was practically no genre left untouched by them except in one or two spheres.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} <b>the</b> <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the disaster, {{no one was}} ever held accountable. Capt. Frederic Speed, a Union officer who sent the 1,978 paroled prisoners into Vicksburg from the parole camp, was charged with grossly {{overcrowding}} Sultana and found guilty. However, the guilty verdict was overturned by the judge advocate general of the army on grounds that Speed {{had been at the}} parole camp all day and had never placed one single soldier on board the Sultana. Captain Williams, who had placed the men on board, was a regular army officer and graduate of West Point, so the military refused to go after one of their own. And Colonel Hatch, who had concocted a bribe with Captain Mason to crowd as many men onto the Sultana as possible, had quickly quit the service and was now a civilian, no longer accountable to a military court. In the end, no one was ever held accountable for the greatest maritime disaster in United States history.|$|E
25|$|At {{first the}} damage {{appeared}} to be minimal, and Philip hoped that once the Adelantado had reassembled the ships, he could continue his voyage, but as time passed <b>the</b> <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the disaster became apparent. Losses to the Armada at El Ferrol were significant; there was general confusion and sadness at the disaster. In mid-November the nuncio sent a sorrowful summary of the facts: thirty vessels were missing, thirteen had crashed into the reefs, {{and there were many}} dead from the Portuguese upper class. Eighteen of the sunken ships were embargoed hulks, whose loss could easily be replaced but the addition of five of the King's principal ships known as the Apostles had perished, the worst loss being the 900 ton galleon Santiago, which had carried 330 soldiers as well as sailors, of whom only twenty-three survived. In addition, disease had ravaged through the ships ever since they had been at port. These could not be replaced so easily and there were few survivors in others. In all nearly 5,000 men either perished to shipwrecks or were dead or sick to disease.|$|E

60|$|This treaty did {{not contain}} one word which could justify any {{interference}} in the Nabob's government. That evil system, as Mr. Hastings calls it, is not even mentioned or alluded to; nor is there, I again say, one word which authorized Warren Hastings, or any other person whatever, to interfere in the interior affairs of his country. He was legally constituted Viceroy of Oude; his dignity of Vizier of the Empire, with all the power which that office gave him, derived from and held under the Mogul government, he legally possessed; and this evil system, which Mr. Hastings says led him to commit <b>the</b> <b>enormities</b> <b>of</b> which you shall hear by-and-by, was neither more nor less than what I have now stated.|$|R
