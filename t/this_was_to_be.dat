5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, both ships were fitted with a degaussing coil to protect them against magnetic mines. Leipzig had her aircraft equipment removed in 1941, along with her after torpedo tubes. In 1942, Nürnbergs aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were also removed. Throughout the war, the ships' radar suites were upgraded; in March 1941, Nürnberg was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942, a FuMO 25 radar set was installed. The latter was a search radar for surface targets and low-flying aircraft at low range. The FuMO 21 set {{was replaced by the}} short-range FuMO 63 Hohentwiel 50-centimeter radar. Nürnberg was also fitted with four Metox radar warning receivers. Leipzig did not receive her FuMO 24/25 radar set until 1943; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the last modification for Leipzig.|$|E

5|$|As a final {{attempt to}} stop the Allied advances, the Japanese Imperial High Command planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū codenamed Operation Ketsugō. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a radical {{departure}} from the defense in depth plans used in the invasions of Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Instead, everything was staked on the beachhead; more than 3,000 kamikazes would be sent to attack the amphibious transports before troops and cargo were disembarked on the beach.|$|E
5|$|By 1909 {{the school}} library had 6,000 books valued at $3,500 and Ray D. Fisher was librarian. During November of that year the library {{received}} new furniture as Eaton Hall opened, and many departments were moved to it from Waller Hall. The library was re-cataloged in 1912 by Lucia Haley, a specialist from New York City hired by the school for this task. At that time the librarian was Dr. Lyle. Plans at this time called for constructing a building where the Art Building now stands {{to serve as a}} memorial to the pioneers of the university. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the future home of the library, but the building was never built. In 1913, the librarian was Mary Field, and the collection was still about 6,000 volumes. Field was replaced the following year by Fannie J. Elliot.|$|E

Between 1952 and 1967 the ECSC Council held its Luxembourg meetings in the Cercle Municipal on Place d’Armes. Its secretariat moved on numerous occasions but between 1955 and 1967 it was housed in the Verlorenkost district of the city. In 1957 {{with the creation of}} two new Communities with their own Councils, discretion on location was given to the current President.

5|$|Despite the pursued aim of pan-Germanic unification, {{the primary}} goal of the German Reich’s {{territorial}} expansionism was to acquire sufficient Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe for the Germanic übermenschen or superior men. The primary objective of this aim was to transform Germany into a complete economic autarky, the end-result of which would be a state of continent-wide German hegemony over Europe. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accomplished through the enlargement of the territorial base of the German state and the expansion of the German population, and the wholesale extermination of the indigenous Slavic inhabitants and the Germanisation of Baltic inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Ehren Kruger's {{screenplay}} {{was written}} as a spec script; in February 2001, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) purchased the script, with Summit Entertainment to co-finance the film. In October 2002, Terry Gilliam entered negotiations to direct, and rewrote Kruger's script alongside frequent collaborator Tony Grisoni. However, the Writers Guild of America refused to credit Gilliam and Grisoni for their rewrite work, and Kruger received sole credit. After Gilliam's hiring, production {{was put on}} fast track for a target November 2004 theatrical release date. MGM had trouble financing the film, and dropped out as main distributor. Weeks later, Bob Weinstein, under his Dimension Films production company, {{made a deal with}} MGM and Summit to co-finance The Brothers Grimm, and become the lead distributor. Projected at $75 million, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Dimension Films' most expensive film ever.|$|E
5|$|Following {{training}} exercises {{with the}} 6th Flotilla from 16 July 1939 to 1 October 1939, U-42 was moved into active service with the 6th Flotilla, ready for operations. The day after her training exercises ended, she left Wilhelmshaven on 2 October. On a 12-day journey, U-42 traveled into the North Sea and circumnavigated the British Isles. She then entered the North Atlantic {{in search of}} any Allied convoys. During this operation, one enemy ship was damaged, the 4,803-ton British steam freighter SS Stonepool, which had become separated from Convoy OB 17 while sailing from Liverpool, England to North America. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the boat's first and only attack on any Allied merchant vessel.|$|E

5|$|General Trưởng was {{recalled}} to Saigon on 19 March {{to brief}} Thiệu on his withdrawal plan. The general developed two contingency plans: The first was predicated on government control of Highway 1, {{which would be}} utilized for two simultaneous withdrawals from Huế and Chu Lai to Da Nang; The second course presupposed PAVN interdiction of the highway {{and called for a}} withdrawal into three enclaves: Huế, Da Nang, and Chu Lai. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> only an interim measure, however, since the forces that withdrew to Huế and Chu Lai would then be sea-lifted to Da Nang by the navy. The president then stunned the general by announcing he misinterpreted his previous orders: The old imperial capital of Huế was not to be abandoned. Making matters worse, Trưởng discovered that his force was to be reduced by the removal of the Marine Division.|$|E
5|$|He joined South Australia part {{way through}} the 193536 season, and in March 1936, he scored a century (121) on his {{first-class}} cricket debut against Tasmania at the Adelaide Oval. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his only match of the season, which {{left him with a}} debut season average of 121.00. At the start of his first full season, he followed this up with scores of 16 and four against the touring England team and Victoria and seven and 19 against New South Wales. On Christmas Day, 1936, however, he scored his second first-class century, 104 against Queensland in the first innings. He would go on to score 52 in the second.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, British {{broadcaster}} Channel 4 commissioned shipwreck hunter David Mearns and his company, Blue Water Recoveries, {{to locate}} the wreck of Hood, and if possible, produce underwater footage of both the battlecruiser and her attacker, Bismarck. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used for a major event documentary to be aired on the 60th anniversary of the ships' battle. This {{was the first time}} anyone had attempted to locate Hoods resting place. Mearns had spent the previous six years privately researching the fate of Hood with the goal of finding the battlecruiser, and had acquired the support of the Royal Navy, the HMS Hood Association and other veterans groups, and the last living survivor, Ted Briggs.|$|E

5|$|In December 1964, Baxter played brilliantly {{to set up}} a 2–0 win for Rangers in an away {{game against}} Rapid Vienna in the European Cup. With the game won, rather than play out time Baxter's {{confidence}} over-extended into arrogance to make fun of his opponents with the ball. In the last minute he went to 'nutmeg' an opponent, who was having none of it and broke Baxter's leg with his challenge. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a watershed for Baxter.

5|$|In India, {{unaware of}} the delayed {{shipment}} and confident {{of being able to}} rally the Indian sepoy, the plot for the mutiny took its final shape. Under the plans, the 23rd Cavalry in Punjab was to seize weapons and kill their officers while on roll call on 21 February. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> followed by mutiny in the 26th Punjab, which was to be the signal for the uprising to begin, resulting in an advance on Delhi and Lahore.

5|$|In {{response}} to this emerging threat, Brock moved quickly to bolster Canadian defences. He strengthened the fortifications of Quebec by building walls and an elevated battery. Brock succeeded in creating a formidable defensive position due largely to his military reading, which included several volumes on the science of running and setting up artillery. He also rearranged and strengthened the Provincial Marine (responsible for transport on the lakes and rivers). He ordered warships to be built and developed a naval force capable of holding the Great Lakes. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pivotal during the war. But Brock's appropriation of civilian lands and labour for military use brought him into conflict with the civilian authorities led by Thomas Dunn.|$|E
