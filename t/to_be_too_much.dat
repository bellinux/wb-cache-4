5|$|In 1951, Soedjatmoko {{moved to}} Washington D.C. to {{establish}} the political desk at the Indonesian embassy there; he also became Alternate Permanent Representative of Indonesia at the UN. This busy schedule, demanding a commute between three cities, proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for him and {{he dropped out of}} the Littauer Center. In late 1951, he resigned from his positions and went to Europe for nine months, seeking political inspiration. In Yugoslavia, he met Milovan Djilas, who impressed him greatly.|$|E
5|$|The Actor's Children was {{released}} with enthusiasm and positive reviews in trade publications. The Moving Picture World reviews would be favorable and without much criticism, even calling the acting convincing. A more honest review in The New York Dramatic Mirror {{was written by}} a reviewer who {{was pleased with the}} production, but offered criticism about the production's weaker aspects. The reviewer found there <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> emphasis on the unimportant parts and a lack of emotion from the actors, and the child actors performance was faulted by repeatedly looking at the camera. Critical reception of the film may not have been entirely neutral for a number of reasons. Edwin Thanhouser was a well-liked gentleman who had many friends in the Patents Company that likely wanted him to succeed. Furthermore, writers in the magazines hoped that Independents would succeed and challenge the Patents Company's stranglehold on the industry. Also, film critics and reviewers of the era would balance the negativity of even the worst films with some favorable aspects. Even without any ulterior motives, the film may have been worthy of a favorable review.|$|E
5|$|Yotsuba goes to an udon shop {{without her}} father's knowledge, and {{is allowed to}} watch udon being made. After getting a pizza menu in the mail, the Koiwais order a couple, though one turns out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for Yotsuba to hold. After an {{announcement}} of an upcoming camping trip, Yanda arrives with various bubble-blowing devices, which they play inside, then outside, with. Yotsuba, Fuka, and Fuka's classmate from chapter 45 go to a shrine to pick chestnuts, and Yotsuba learns about burr covers and bug infestations. Koiwai gives Yotsuba her own camera, which she uses to go around taking pictures of people. Yotsuba meets Miura at her apartment building, and they go to Ena's. On the way, a dog grabs her teddy bear and shakes it, making it smell like dog, so they wash it and dry it at the Ayases'. As a result, the bear's ability to speak is broken, so Asagi offers to repair it overnight. Yotsuba spends much of the intervening time sulking about Juralumin's absence until Yanda finally gets a reaction out of her. She goes to the Ayases', where she finds Juralumin repaired.|$|E

25|$|T68 – Perhaps {{the most}} radical of the experiments, the T68 {{featured}} two 40mm cannons, one mounted {{on top of the}} other, plus a stabilizer on top of the two guns.

25|$|However, {{with nine}} laps remaining, the extra strain Seton was putting through his already tiring engine proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> - a broken valve spring forcing {{the car into}} retirement, and leaving Perkins in front for his team's second Bathurst crown, and his fifth as a driver.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} of the blockhouses, sweeper operations and concentration camps proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for the Boers.

25|$|Shortly after Matt’s departure, local drummer Tim Olsen {{was brought}} in as a replacement. Also around that time, Marc-André Mongeon was brought as a bassist (the first since Shomir had left the band in 2001). As a five-piece, the band toured {{throughout}} the summer of 2004 across Canada. By the time mid-2005 came around, the constant touring proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for Marc and Dave {{and they decided to}} step down.|$|E
25|$|Jeffress {{joined the}} Acoustical Society of America in 1939 and was elected a fellow in 1948. He served the ASA {{for eight years}} as {{associate}} editor of psychological acoustics beginning in 1962.

Upon Jeffress' retirement as associate editor, the job was re-examined and found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for one person, and two subsections were formed with an associate editor for each.|$|E

25|$|The first {{plans for}} a bridge across the Derwent River {{had been made in}} 1832, but the width and depth of the river, {{combined}} with the powerful currents, proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of a deterrent for then current construction materials and techniques. A solution was hit upon to create a pontoon bridge, and in 1943, the Hobart Bridge was opened, spanning the Derwent River for the first time. To deal with the perceived problem of upriver shipping access, a lifting span was added near the western landing that allowed quite large vessels to pass through.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} season, {{things got}} a bit better for the Cents in the standings. Although they finished last in the Interior Division yet again, they managed to avoid the league basement. Merritt went 26–38–2, ending up well ahead of the last place Nanaimo Clippers. Zelinski continued his torrid scoring pace, finishing fifth in league scoring with 50 goals, 61 assists, and 111 points in 66 games. In the playoffs, Merritt once again locked horns with the Kelowna squad {{in the first round}} and again the Buckaroos proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> beating the Centennials in seven games.|$|E
25|$|The most {{brilliant}} analysis ever {{done on a}} structural puzzle was surely the solution (1953) of the terramycin problem. It was a problem of great industrial importance, and hence many able chemists had performed {{an enormous amount of}} work trying to determine the structure. There seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> data to resolve the problem, because a significant number of observations, although experimentally correct, were very misleading. Woodward took a large piece of cardboard, wrote on it all the facts and, by thought alone, deduced the correct structure for terramycin. Nobody else could have done that at the time.|$|E

25|$|Things {{began to}} look up for the Centennials in the 1995–96 season as the team jumped to 26 wins and third place in the Interior Division. Buoyed by the offence of John Coyle and Bryan Phillips, who {{finished}} sixth and eighth respectively in BCJHL scoring, the Centennials returned to the playoffs with a first round miniseries against the South Surrey Eagles. Merritt eliminated the Eagles 2–0 {{in the best of}} three series and advanced to the league quarterfinals, where it would face the Chilliwack Chiefs. The Chiefs proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for the Cents, as they beat Merritt in five games.|$|E
25|$|When Anne-Thérèse was 15, tragedy {{struck the}} family {{when her father}} was killed by bandits as he {{traveled}} home to his family. The grief proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for her mother, who already had lost two children, and she {{fell into a deep}} and incapacitating depression. For many years, Anne-Thérèse accepted the responsibility of caring for her mother and sister, as well as the family's home and garden. At the age of 20, Anne-Thérèse asked her mother's blessing to join a religious order, but Isabelle — still unable to cope with her loss — refused. Five years later, Isabelle recognized the depth of Anne-Thérèse's devotion and permitted her to leave.|$|E
25|$|In the 1850s, a steam mill {{was erected}} {{close to the}} smock mill. It was powered by a beam engine and drove two pairs of millstones. a third pair was added at a later date, along with other {{machines}} for cleaning grain and dressing flour. This proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for the beam engine {{with the result that}} the beam broke and the engine was wrecked. The mill was worked by the Clover family until 1860 when it was dismantled. The machinery, cap and sails from the smock mill were incorporated into the new tower mill. Work started on 8 May 1860 and was completed in February 1861.|$|E

5000|$|An obvious modern {{point about}} {{environment}} and security is distribution {{of risk and}} even global flows of risk.

Proper balance is not the mere matter of comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable. Ulrich Beck and others have written on the [...] "risk society" [...] which seems {{to enter into the}} discussions both of economy and security. Subsidiarity may include levels of government which share authority, for example, national government, religious or organizational government, family government, and individual government. There would not seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a monopoly over use of force. There may be a tendency for eco-anarchism here.|$|R

25|$|In the Fairfax Court House action, the Confederate force {{killed at}} least four of the Union troops and wounded or took {{prisoner}} most of the others. The Confederates suffered a similar number of killed and wounded according to the only report on their casualties by a Union sergeant.

Finding the prisoners from the 11th New York Cavalry and from other Union units <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of a burden on the march north, Stuart paroled them at Brookeville, Maryland on the night of June 2829.|$|E
25|$|This {{required}} the Steadicam {{to be on}} a special mount modeled on a wheelchair in which the operator sat while pulling a platform with the sound man. The weight of the rig and its occupants proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for the original tires however, resulting in a blowout one day that almost caused a serious crash. Solid tires were then mounted on the rig. Kubrick also had a highly accurate speedometer mounted on the rig so as to duplicate the exact tempo of a given shot so that Brown could perform take after identical take. Brown also discusses how the scenes in the hedge maze were shot with a Steadicam.|$|E
25|$|Initially the motormen were to both {{drive and}} sell tickets, {{but this was}} found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> work for one person to do efficiently. Conductors were {{therefore}} introduced almost immediately. It turned out that operating a correspondence between the Skøyen Line and the Briskeby Line at Parkveien did not work, as trams from Majorstuen were full and most passengers forced to walk into town. Thus from April KES introduced direct services from Skillebekk on the Skøyen Line to Jernbanetorget. It quickly turned out the company had too few trams and four more were delivered {{by the end of}} the year. The Skøyen Line was extended to Frognergaden on 31 December.|$|E
