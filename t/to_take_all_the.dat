Roark says that if Keating promises to build it exactly as designed, Roark will do it while permitting Keating <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> credit. With prodding from the envious Toohey, the firm backing the housing project decides to alter the design presented by Keating. Roark decides, with Francon's secret help, to rig explosives to the buildings and destroy them. Roark is arrested at the site after the demolition. In order to demonstrate Roark's guilt, Toohey pressures Keating into privately confessing that Roark designed the project.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Park {{tied with}} local rivals Wallasey for the {{championship}} which {{was made possible by}} the acquisition of fast bowler Jack Bartley who took 67 wickets at an average of 10.37. During two spells with the club between 1931 and 1936, Bartley would take over 400 wickets for which two of those seasons would see him snare over 100 dismissals. He became the second 1st XI bowler <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> wickets in a match as he claimed 10-37 against New Brighton in 1935.It was in that particular year that saw Park celebrate winning the championship again. It was a second title success for captain Arthur Cooke who was to take charge of the 1st XI on three separate occasions (1929-1932, 1934-1936 and 1938-1939).|$|E
25|$|When Gonzalo {{arrived at}} the main bohío of Quemuenchatocha, he found the Muisca ruler sitting in his throne and {{surrounded}} by his closest companions. All men were dressed in expensive mantles and adorned with golden crowns. On August 20, 1537, the Spanish beat the zaque and the big and strong Muisca ruler was taken captive to Suesca. There he was tortured and the Spanish soldiers hoped he would reveal where he hid his precious properties. The absence of Quemuenchatocha paved the route for his nephew Aquiminzaque to succeed him as ruler of the northern Muisca, a practice common in Muisca traditions. When Quemuenchatocha was finally released from captivity in Suesca, he fled to Ramiriquí, where he died shortly after. The Spanish soldiers found gold, emeralds, silver, mantles and other valuables in Tunja. They were not able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> precious pieces and many were secretly taken away by the Muisca, using folded deer skins. They hid the valuables in nearby hills.|$|E

25|$|On his return, Macleod was {{surprised}} and expressed doubt about the results. Banting took this as an attack on his integrity. They argued bitterly, but Banting finally accepted Macleod's instruction that further experiments were needed, and he even convinced Macleod to provide better working conditions and to give him and Best a salary. Further experiments were successful and the three started to present their work at meetings. Macleod was a far better orator, and Banting {{came to believe that}} he wanted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> credit. Their discovery was first published in the February 1922 issue of The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine. Macleod declined co-authorship because he considered it Banting's and Best's work. Despite their success, there remained the issue of how to get enough pancreas extract to continue the experiments. Together, the three researchers developed alcohol extraction, which proved to be far more efficient than other methods. This convinced Macleod to divert the whole laboratory to insulin research and to bring in the biochemist James Collip to help with purifying the extract.|$|E
25|$|In all, some 650–800 Germans died, {{and some}} 550 of the around 1,400 wet and cold {{survivors}} of Blücher were captured, by soldiers from Company no. 4 of the Norwegian Royal Guards {{under the command}} of Kaptein (Captain) A. J. T. Petersson. In total, some 1,200 of the survivors had made it ashore at Frogn near Drøbak and the guardsmen were supposed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Germans prisoner, but mainly focused on tending for the many wounded and dying. Around 1,000 of the Germans, including Generalmajor Erwin Engelbrecht and Admiral Oskar Kummetz, were eventually moved to a nearby farm and placed under light guard. None of the prisoners were interrogated. By 18:30, the Norwegian soldiers withdrew from the area, abandoning the Germans. Generalmajor Engelbrecht and Admiral Kummetz then made their way to Oslo. The German leading officers reached Oslo at 22:00, moving into the Hotel Continental, though without the most of the troops intended to occupy the Norwegian capital. Many of the German wounded were initially taken to Åsgården summer hotel in Åsgårdstrand for medical care, where Norwegian wounded had already been brought. The hotel was the temporary improvised location for the Royal Norwegian Navy Hospital, which had been evacuated from Horten at midnight on 8 April.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this time that the Cisplatine War, the first armed {{conflict}} between both countries, started. From 1825 to 1828 {{the forces of the}} United Provinces of the Río de la Plata outfought those of the Brazilian Empire, until the signing of the Treaty of Montevideo that gave independence to Uruguay from both countries. Given the high cost of the war for both sides and the burdens it imposed on trade between the United Provinces and the United Kingdom, the latter pressed the two belligerent parties to engage in peace negotiations in Rio de Janeiro. Under British and French mediation, the United Provinces of River Plate and the Empire of Brazil signed the 1828 Treaty of Montevideo, which acknowledged the independence of the Cisplatine Province under the name Eastern Republic of Uruguay. Troops of both countries would face each other once again later, during the Platine War, when a coalition of Brazil, Uruguay and Argentine rebels managed to defeat Rosas (helped in turn by Uruguayan rebels led by Manuel Oribe). Another war almost happened during the 1870s when Brazil refused to accept Argentina's desire <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Chaco region for itself {{after the end of the}} Paraguayan War (also known as the War of the Triple Alliance) when both countries were allies against Paraguay.|$|E

500|$|Before Congress {{abolished}} {{the practice in}} 1873, the government made silver legal tender alongside gold.

On January 3, 1891, two [...] "free silver" [...] advocates called at the Philadelphia Mint with a large ingot of silver, and asked for it to be coined. [...] When the weighing clerk declined, they asked to see Bosbyshell, who received them, but refused their demand. [...] He did, however, write at their request a letter stating that the laws forbade coinage of silver provided by the public.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Sasha {{signed with}} Global Underground to produce another mix album.

[...] "I tried <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> separate sounds to all the tracks [...] ", he later explained, [...] "and it allowed me to mix the tracks together on a much deeper level."

Meanwhile, Diskin informed Presley about the publishing issues. Presley supported Moman, assuring Diskin that he and the producer would handle the session work. Diskin contacted Parker, who told him to return to California. Moman retained the publishing rights, and the sessions were scheduled to resume several weeks later.|$|E

500|$|An {{improved}} model, the Remington No.2, {{was also}} introduced in 1878. The new machine {{was able to}} type upper and lowercase characters, thus remedying a significant drawback of its predecessor. As the only typewriter manufacturer, Remington maintained a monopoly position until the American Writing Machine Company introduced a typewriter {{to compete with the}} Remington machines in 1881. In response to the new competition, Remington lowered the price of the Sholes and Glidden (referred to in sales literature as the Remington No.1) to $80, and negotiated an agreement with the marketing firm Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> machines produced.

500|$|The Coinage Act of 1873 {{eliminated}} the standard silver dollar. It also repealed the statutory provisions allowing silver bullion {{to be presented}} to the Mint and returned in the form of circulating money. In passing the Coinage Act, Congress eliminated bimetallism. [...] During the economic chaos of the Panic of 1873, the price of silver dropped significantly, but the Mint would accept none for striking into legal tender. Silver producers complained, and many Americans came to believe that only through bimetallism could the nation achieve and maintain prosperity. They called for the return to pre-1873 laws, which would require the Mint <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> silver offered it and return it, struck into silver dollars. This would inflate the money supply, and, adherents argued, increase the nation's prosperity. Critics contended that the inflation which would follow the introduction of such a policy would harm workers, whose wages would not rise as fast as prices would, and the operation of Gresham's law would drive gold from circulation, effectively placing the United States on a silver standard.|$|E
