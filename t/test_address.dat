It was observed that post prandial (at 2 hour) plasma glucose after glucose administration was significantly lower than the fasting level (p< 0. 05 – p< 0. 001). However, post prandial plasma glucose at 2 hour after their usual meal exhibited a significantly higher level than the fasting and post glucose level ((p< 0. 05 – p< 0. 001). Glucose appears to be a stronger agent than the more natural mixed meal in these individuals in causing post prandial lowering of plasma glucose. Hence, these individuals are to be evaluated with their usual meals before considering further investigations.

40|$|Robust {{methods for}} {{identifying}} patterns of expression in genome-wide data {{are important for}} generating hypotheses regarding gene function. To this end, several analytic methods {{have been developed for}} detecting periodic patterns. We improve one such method, JTK_CYCLE, by explicitly calculating the null distribution such that it accounts for multiple hypothesis testing and by including non-sinusoidal reference waveforms. We term this method empirical JTK_CYCLE with asymmetry search, and we compare its performance to JTK_CYCLE with Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg multiple hypothesis testing correction, as well as to five other methods: cyclohedron <b>test,</b> <b>address</b> reduction, stable persistence, ANOVA, and F 24. We find that ANOVA, F 24, and JTK_CYCLE consistently outperform the other three methods when data are limited and noisy; empirical JTK_CYCLE with asymmetry search gives the greatest sensitivity while controlling for the false discovery rate. Our analysis also provides insight into experimental design and we find that, for a fixed number of samples, better sensitivity and specificity are achieved with higher numbers of replicates than with higher sampling density. Application of the methods to detecting circadian rhythms in a metadataset of microarrays that quantify time-dependent gene expression in whole heads of Drosophila melanogaster reveals annotations that are enriched among genes with highly asymmetric waveforms. These include a wide range of oxidation reduction and metabolic genes, as well as genes with transcripts that have multiple splice forms...|$|E
40|$|On August 1 st 1987 New Zealand {{became the}} first {{country in the world}} to {{introduce}} a graduated driver licensing system. The system was intended to address the over-representation of beginning drivers in crashes. Later evaluations of the system showed that there had been an initial drop of about 25 % in novice driver casualties. This resulted mainly from the drop in exposure as young people were deterred from early licensing. Nevertheless a durable reduction of about 8 % in respect of drivers aged 15 - 19 years of age was achieved. Ten year's later was an appropriate time to review the system. The Land Transport Safety Authority conducted the largest round of public consultation ever conducted by a New Zealand government department. Over fifty thousand public submissions were received. At the same time a worldwide literature review of best practice was conducted. The New Zealand graduated licensing system, while comprehensive, did not include any form of assessment to graduate from restricted to full licence status. It was decided that a test should be constructed to assess the safe driving skills and abilities of restricted licence holders wishing to “graduate ” to full licence status after at least 18 months of solo driving. It was intended that the <b>test</b> <b>address</b> the problems of New Zealand novice drivers in New Zealand conditions. In 1998 a team of Australian consultants were contracted to develop a Full Licence Test. Land Transport Safety Authority specified that the test was to focus on the driver’s situational awareness, visual scanning skills, hazard identification skills, attention allocation and proactive or reactive hazard avoidance skills. Elements of vehicle control, manoeuvring and adherence to road rules were also to be included. RoSPA 65 th Road Safety Congress Page 2 of...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{studies in}} the last few years have shown that the {{standard}} 250 µg dose used in ACTH stimulation test may be very high and have suggested that a dose of 1 µg may be sufficient for evaluating hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. AIMS: To evaluate the role of low dose ACTH stimulation test in patients with suspected Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency (SAI). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients of suspected SAI with a documented pitui-tary lesion and seven normal healthy controls were included in the study. All the subjects underwent ACTH stimulation test with standard high dose (HD = 250 µg) and low dose (LD = 1 µg) ACTH. Insulin Induced Hypoglycaemia (IIH) test was done in 7 out of 9 patients in whom the results of the two tests were discordant. The cut off for normal HD stimulation test was taken as peak cortisol response> 18 µg/dl and for LD test, either a cortisol response of> 18 µg/dl or an increment of more than 7 µg/dl over the basal value at any time during the test, on the basis of response observed in controls. RESULTS: 22 / 31 patients (74 %) in SAI group showed concordant results with both tests, whereas nine patients had discordant results. These nine patients showed AI with LD ACTH, but HD ACTH test showed a normal response. In 7 of these 9 patients who underwent IIH, AI was confirmed in 6. CONCLUSION: The LD ACTH stimulation test seems to be better than HD ACTH stimulation test for evaluating HPA axis in patients with suspected SAI. When basal cortisol is normal, LD ACTH stimula-tion test detects subtle SAI.
