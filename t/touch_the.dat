5|$|The {{most basic}} {{property}} of the Reuleaux triangle {{is that it has}} constant width, meaning that for every pair of parallel supporting lines (two lines of the same slope that both <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> shape without crossing through it) the two lines have the same Euclidean distance from each other, regardless of the orientation of these lines. In any pair of parallel supporting lines, one of the two lines will necessarily <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> triangle at one of its vertices. The other supporting line may <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> triangle at any point on the opposite arc, and their distance (the width of the Reuleaux triangle) equals the radius of this arc.|$|E

5|$|During the 1999–2000 season, on February 15, 2000, Brodeur was {{credited}} with his second career goal, as Brodeur was the last Devils player on the ice to <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> puck before Daymond Langkow of the Flyers accidentally put the puck into his own empty net during a delayed penalty call against the Devils. Brodeur had previously stopped an attempted Flyers shot.|$|E

5|$|Eleven goaltenders {{have scored}} {{a total of}} {{fourteen}} goals in National Hockey League (NHL) games. A goalkeeper can score by either shooting the puck into the net, or being awarded the goal as the last player on his team to <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> puck when an opponent scored an own goal. A goal scored by shooting the puck is particularly challenging as the goaltender has to aim for a six-foot-wide net that is close to 180 feet away, while avoiding opposing defencemen; {{in the case of}} own goals, the combined circumstance of the own goal itself in addition to the goaltender being the last player to <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> puck makes it a very rare occurrence. Of the fourteen goals, seven were scored by shooting the puck and seven were the result of own goals.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses {{also have}} an {{excellent}} sense of <b>touch.</b> <b>The</b> octopus's suction cups are equipped with chemoreceptors so the octopus can taste what it touches. Octopus arms do not become tangled or stuck to each other because the sensors recognise octopus skin and prevent self-attachment.|$|E

If a kickoff is chosen it must be a place kick, and the ball can be held, placed on the ground, or placed on a tee prior to the kick. As in American football, the ball must go at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the kicking team.|$|E

5|$|All bovids {{have the}} similar basic form - a snout with a blunt end, {{one or more}} pairs of horns (generally present on males) {{immediately}} after the oval or pointed ears, a distinct neck and limbs, and a tail varying in length and bushiness among the species. Most bovids exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males usually larger as well as heavier than females. Sexual dimorphism is more prominent in medium- to large-sized bovids. All bovids have four toes on each foot – they walk on the central two (the hooves), while the outer two (the dewclaws) are much smaller and rarely <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} <b>touch.</b> <b>The</b> pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them {{the feel of a}} small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end of}} the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a unique {{combination}} of traits not in themselves unique. The transverse processes, the side extensions, of the tail are present up to the twenty-eighth vertebra of the series. The transverse processes of the front tail vertebrae are rod-shaped with narrow bases and do not <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> plate formed by the fusion of the processes of the sacral vertebrae. The chevrons, bones pointing to below from the bottom side of the tail vertebrae, have {{the shape of an}} inverted T. The length of the ilium equals, or is greater than, that of the thighbone.|$|E
50|$|The game {{is played}} by groups of four to six players {{standing}} in a circle 2 metres apart and uses either an association football or a volleyball ball. Using feet and knees only, in no set order but without consecutive <b>touches,</b> <b>the</b> players attempt to keep <b>the</b> ball from <b>touching</b> <b>the</b> ground. The group that has <b>the</b> most <b>touches</b> in a set time wins. If <b>the</b> ball <b>touches</b> <b>the</b> ground the count is restarted.|$|R

Hari performs death rituals (Śrāddha) for Mahadev but crows (symbolic {{of the spirit of}} the deceased in Hinduism) refuse to <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> offerings. Hari mumbles something while offering food after which crow touches the offerings.|$|E
5|$|In the match, {{which took}} place in Bologna, Italy, San Marino had the {{kick-off}} and the ball was quickly played through the inside-right channel. England defender Stuart Pearce attempted a back-pass to goalkeeper David Seaman. Pearce's pass was under-hit and Gualtieri ran on to <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> ball past Seaman. The goal was timed at 8.3 seconds, which remains the fastest World Cup goal scored in either qualifying or the finals. England took 20 minutes to equalise and eventually finished winning the match 7–1.|$|E

5|$|Sophie arrives {{while they}} argue and is lured upstairs; the Doctor and Craig follow, {{learning}} from Amy that Craig's building {{has never had}} a second floor. Inside, they find an alien ship housing a primitive time engine. The ship crashed some time ago and has used a perception filter to disguise itself as part of Craig's house. The ship's emergency holographic program has been drawing in passersby, all who have a desire to escape, to find a replacement pilot for itself, but they were killed in the attempt. The machine identifies the Doctor as a possible pilot and tries to draw him to the controls, but the Doctor warns that if he should <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> controls, the ship could explode and take the solar system with it. The Doctor convinces Craig to <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> controls since {{he does not want to}} leave due to his love for Sophie, which will counteract the ship's protocols. Craig does so, and he and Sophie admit their love and share a kiss that breaks the ship's hold on the Doctor and themselves. The three escape in time to see the perception filter turn off and the ship implode, leaving Craig's undamaged one-story flat below.|$|E
