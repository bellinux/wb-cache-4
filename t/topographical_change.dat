50|$|A <b>topographical</b> <b>change</b> means a {{measurable}} and noticeable change in land characteristics, {{in terms of}} elevation, slope, orientation, and land coverage. These could be either natural (e.g., trees) or artificial (e.g., houses).Non-topographical emergencies are situations where the emergency is non-physical in nature. The collapse of the New York stock market in 1929 is such an example, and the global liquidity crisis of August 2007 is another example.The model treats <b>topographical</b> <b>change</b> as a continuum ranging between 0 and 1 that gives the estimated visual fractional change in the environment.|$|E

40|$|In {{historical}} and geologic times significant climatic and <b>topographical</b> <b>changes</b> have taken place, the <b>topographical</b> <b>changes</b> are those where it varies the coordinate «z» {{that corresponds to}} the altitude or depth of the environment. The climatic <b>changes</b> can produce <b>topographical</b> <b>changes,</b> {{and in the other}} hand, <b>topographical</b> <b>changes</b> more rarely produce climatic changes. The human action generates many of these changes and it accelerates them notably. The dynamic interaction in the time of the three factors, climatic, topographical, and human it is what is denominated «environmental change».

Land-cover is classified by applying membership-based classification and contextual improvements based on the synergy of orthophotos and LiDAR-based elevation data. <b>Topographical</b> <b>change</b> is calculated by differencing of LiDAR derived digital terrain models. The above ground biomass is quantified by applying a local-maximum algorithm for tree top detection, in combination with allometric equations. The land cover classification accuracies were improved from 65 % (using only LiDAR) and 76 % (using only orthophotos) to 90 % (using data synergy) for 2006. A similar increase from respectively 64 % and 75 % to 91 % was established for 2012. The increased accuracies demonstrate the effectiveness of using data synergy of LiDAR and orthophotos using object-based image analysis to quantify landscape changes, caused by an active landslide.

Interoceptive accuracy was evaluated with a heartbeat detection task and the spatial patterns of bodily sensations to specific emotions, including anger, fear, disgust, happiness, sadness, and neutral, were visualized using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) analyses. Distinct patterns of bodily sensations were identified for different emotional states.

40|$|Microscale and {{nanoscale}} surface topography {{changes can}} influence cell functions, including morphology. Although in vitro responses to static topography are novel, cells in vivo constantly remodel topography. To {{better understand how}} cells respond to changes in topography over time, we developed a soft polyacrylamide hydrogel with magnetic nickel microwires randomly oriented in {{the surface of the}} material. Varying the magnetic field around the microwires reversibly induced their alignment with the direction of the field, causing the smooth hydrogel surface to develop small wrinkles; changes in surface roughness, ΔR RMS, ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 70 μm and could be oscillated without hydrogel creep. Vascular smooth muscle cell morphology was assessed when exposed to acute and dynamic topography changes. Area and shape changes occurred when an acute <b>topographical</b> <b>change</b> was imposed for substrates exceeding roughness of 0. 2 μm, but longer-term oscillating topography did not produce significant changes in morphology irrespective of wire stiffness.

40|$|The coastal landforms {{along the}} south west coast of Kanyakumari have {{undergone}} remarkable change in terms of shape and disposition due to both natural and anthropogenic interference. An attempt is made here to map the coastal landforms along the coast using remote sensing and GIS techniques. Spatial data sources, such as, topographical map published by Survey of India, Landsat ETM+ (30  m) image, IKONOS image (0. 82  m), SRTM and ASTER DEM datasets have been comprehensively analyzed for extracting coastal landforms. Change detection methods, such as, (i) <b>topographical</b> <b>change</b> detection, (ii) cross-shore profile analysis, (iii) Geomorphic Change Detection (GCD) using DEM of Difference (DoD) were adopted for assessment of volumetric changes of coastal landforms for the period between 2000 and 2011. The GCD analysis uses ASTER and SRTM DEM datasets by resampling them into common scale (pixel size) using pixel-by-pixel based Wavelet Transform and Pan-Sharpening techniques in ERDAS Imagine software. Volumetric changes of coastal landforms were validated with data derived from GPS-based field survey. Coastal landform units were mapped based on process of their evolution such as beach landforms including sandy beach, cusp, berm, scarp, beach terrace, upland, rockyshore, cliffs, wave-cut notches and wave-cut platforms; and the fluvial landforms. Comprising of alluvial plain, flood plains, and other shallow marshes in estuaries. The <b>topographical</b> <b>change</b> analysis reveals that the beach landforms have reduced their elevation ranging from 1 to 3  m probably due to sediment removal or flattening. Analysis of cross-shore profiles for twelve locations indicate varying degrees of loss or gain of coastal landforms. For example, the K 3 -K 3 ′ profile across the Kovalam coast has shown significant erosion (− 0. 26 to − 0. 76  m) of the sandy beaches resulting {{in the formation of}} beach cusps and beach scarps within a distance of 300  m from the shoreline.

40|$|Abstract: Strangford Lough is {{a shallow}} marine embayment, whose present form {{resulted}} from the late Glacial and Holocene marine erosion of a drumlinized coastal lowland platform. Constriction at the Lough mouth means that most waves are generated by wind blowing over restricted fetches. Tidal flats in the northern parts of Strangford Lough show variable morphology and sediment composition. Tidal flats on the up-wind margin are mud-dominated and located in an intact drowned drumlin landscape. Those on the downwind margins are sandy and exist in partly or wholly eroded former drumlin topography. Our preliminary results indicate strong control by wave exposure (mediated by fetch distance) over tidal flat sediments and morphology {{which has led to}} the formation of a series of spatially variable tidal flats within a single depositional basin. At the time scale ofthe Holocene, exposure to wave action appears to exert a major influence on tidal flat morphology in this sediment-limited setting though its long-term control of <b>topographical</b> <b>change</b> (seen here as variable extent of drumlin erosion) and the consequent a d subsequent role of this topography indetermining exposure to contemporary wave action.
