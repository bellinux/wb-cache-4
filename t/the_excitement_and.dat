5|$|The kulintang {{repertoire}} has no fixed labels {{because the}} music {{itself is not}} considered a fixed entity. Due to the fact it is orally transmitted, the repertoire itself is considered something always {{in a state of}} flux due to two primary reasons. First, standardized titles weren’t considered a priority. Though to the musicians themselves the melodies would sound similar, the labels they would place on a particular rhythmic mode or style could vary even from household to household within that same village. For the musicians, the emphasis is on <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>and</b> pleasure of playing the music without much regard to what the piece was referred to as. Secondly, because musicians improvised their pieces regularly, modes and styles were continually revised and changed as they were passed on to a newer generation of musicians, making the pieces and therefore the labels attached to them relevant only during a certain frame of time.|$|E
25|$|Upon release, Saw II: Flesh & Blood {{received}} unfavorable reviews, {{lower than}} the reception for the first Saw game. Critics noted an improved story but disliked the new combat system, which they felt took <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>and</b> suspense out of the game.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>and</b> {{interest}} of the dying game now centred around the batting performance of Alan Knott. His last day survival {{was more than just}} occupation of the crease. Beginning the day without a run to his name, he consistently thumbed his nose at the Australian attack for over three hours, playing shots even though he knew that his ship was sinking under his very feet. It was a magnificent solo effort of defiance.|$|E

25|$|The high {{death toll}} of {{steamboat}} disasters like the Lucy Walker sparked public concern, litigation, and Congressional debates about insurance issues, compensation of victims, responsibilities of vessel owners and masters, {{and need for}} state or federal legislation. There were ad hoc local and Congressional investigations of individual steamboat disasters, especially those involving boiler explosions. The general public was concerned that steamboat racing contributed to these disasters, but many steamboat captains and passengers were thrilled by <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>and</b> gambling accompanying the contests.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Masters and Johnson {{published}} their book, several scholars criticized {{their model}} of the human sexual response cycle. For example, Helen Singer Kaplan argued that Masters and Johnson only evaluated sexual response from a physiological perspective, and that psychological, emotional, and cognitive factors {{need to be taken}} into consideration. As a result, she proposed her {{model of the}} sexual response cycle which includes three phases: desire, excitement, and orgasm. She argues that these three phases are interconnected, yet they have different neurophysiological mechanisms. Similarly, Paul Robinson argued that <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>and</b> plateau phases are the same; he criticizes Masters and Johnson's work for not clearly distinguishing when the excitement phase ends, and when the plateau phase begins.|$|E
25|$|The Hill {{also has}} gone {{but the reason}} for that is a little harder to pin. Up until the 1990s the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the 'outer ground' costing the least to get in and {{attracting}} working class patronage. The invention of the beer can and the portable cooler in the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of limited overs games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in the subtleties of the game and more in <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>and</b> spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.|$|E

500|$|The iceberg {{theory has}} been termed the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway {{believed}} a writer could convey an object or concept while writing about something entirely different. In [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] he elaborates on the mundane activities Nick carries out. The story is filled with seemingly trivial detail: Nick gathers grasshoppers, brews coffee, catches and loses a large trout. In this climactic event, however, <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>and</b> tension becomes so strong that Nick betrays his inner thoughts and he takes a break.|$|E
500|$|In special tribute episode to Michael Jackson, [...] "Michael", Blaine sings [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'".

Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch also gave it an [...] "A−", and said Criss [...] "captured <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>and</b> the spunky bravado of the original". MTV's Kevin P.

500|$|Manning's {{other works}} {{have largely been}} {{described}} as precursors to the two trilogies. Her pre-war novel, The Wind Changes (1937), set in Ireland, anticipates the future works in its [...] "subtle exploration of relationships {{against a backdrop of}} war." [...] Her post-war works, which are alternately set at home and abroad, are considered first, less than successful steps in clarifying her ideas about an expatriate war and how to write about it. Novels and stories set in England and Ireland are permeated by staleness and discontent, while those set abroad highlight <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>and</b> adventure of her later works. Two books set in Jerusalem, The Artist Among the Missing (1949) and School for Love (1951), her first commercial and critical success, are also first steps in exploring themes such war, colonialism and British imperialism.|$|E

500|$|Chariot racing ( [...] , [...] ) {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular ancient Greek, Roman, and Byzantine sports. Chariot racing was {{dangerous}} to both drivers and horses as they often suffered serious injury and even death, but these dangers added to <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>and</b> interest for spectators. Chariot races could be watched by women, who were banned from watching many other sports. In the Roman form of chariot racing, teams represented different groups of financial backers and sometimes competed for the services of particularly skilled drivers. As in modern sports like soccer, spectators generally chose to support a single team, identifying themselves strongly with its fortunes, and violence sometimes broke out between rival factions. The rivalries were sometimes politicized, when teams became associated with competing social or religious ideas. This helps explain why Roman and later Byzantine emperors took control of the teams and appointed many officials to oversee them.|$|E
500|$|The Brisbane Test {{was dubbed}} [...] "Meckiff's Test" [...] by the Australian media; {{speculation}} abounded that the bowler was being chosen {{so he could}} be no-balled as a public relations effort to promote Australia's anti-throwing credentials. Keith Miller described the left-armer's selection as having [...] "peppered this once drab-looking series into a curry hot-pot, with all <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>and</b> trimmings of an Alfred Hitchcock thriller". Miller further predicted that the umpires Egar and Lou Rowan would be having sleepless nights and predicted that the selectors would be biting their fingernails, adding that he hoped Meckiff was not being used as a scapegoat for the anti-throwing movement. Former Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly—a correspondent for The Sydney Morning Herald—described the selection as [...] "one of the most fantastic somersaults in cricket policies in our time". As a close friend of the fast bowler, umpire Egar was in a difficult situation; the duo had won a pairs lawn bowling competition just a few months earlier. Nevertheless, the paceman and umpire socialised freely at the pre-match function.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Chris Carabott {{ranked the}} episode 9.3 out of 10, {{saying it was}} [...] "one of the series' best efforts" [...] {{exploring}} the series' mythology and providing new paths, while also featuring Eko in [...] "one of the most refreshing flashbacks that the series has produced thus far" [...] and [...] "a shocking confrontation" [...] with the Smoke Monster. [...] The reviewer still complained about [...] Nikki and Paulo's participation, considering them [...] "poorly developed" [...] and giving [...] "the {{sense that they are}} being shoehorned in". The website later ranked [...] "The Cost of Living" [...] as the 25th best episode of the series, saying that while early Season 3 [...] "might have dragged a bit", [...] "The Cost of Living" [...] "saw <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>and</b> drama ramp up considerably. The only thing marring this otherwise excellent episode was the presence of Nikki and Paolo." [...] On the other hand, a similar list by the Los Angeles Times ranked it 96th, considering that despite being [...] "actually a pretty good piece of TV", the episode was [...] "just marred {{by the fact that the}} show was forced into killing Mr. Eko, a character whose story was far from over." ...|$|E

500|$|Into the Wild {{received}} generally positive reviews. Booklist {{thought the}} novel [...] "spine-tingling" [...] {{and noted that}} [...] "the cat characters are true to their feline nature, making this sure to appeal to fans of Clare Bell's long-popular Ratha's Creature (1983) and its sequels and also to followers of Brian Jacques' ongoing Redwall series." [...] Publishers Weekly praised <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>and</b> also added that the book would please any person who [...] "has ever wondered what dreams of grandeur may haunt the family cat". The review also praised {{the world of the}} cats and themes put into the book. Although School Library Journal thought the book not as well written as the Redwall series, it did note that the novel presented an [...] "intriguing world with an intricate structure". The review also felt that was too many supporting characters, but [...] "there are standouts who give dimension to the tale". The amount of violence was also noted in the review. Kirkus Reviews joked the book would have cat owners look at their pets nervously before writing how Hunter doesn't have [...] "any hint of sentimentality. Snapping bones, flowing blood, and sudden death abundantly demonstrate how these cats walk on the thin edge of survival". The review noted how teens would see how hard it is for Firepaw to fit in. Washington Times notes the tension rising between Tigerclaw and Firepaw and praised the scene where Longtail challenges Firepaw's right to be in the Clan.|$|E
500|$|The {{first song}} was [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin, which Bell said [...] "was a fun homage to Michael Jackson, and it {{set the tone}} for the rest of the episode". Futterman said that Blaine's [...] "slick showmanship" [...] made him a [...] "natural for lead vocals", and Slezak called it [...] "the best use of Darren Criss' voice on Glee in quite some time" [...] and gave it an [...] "A−". Lynch also gave it an [...] "A−", and said Criss [...] "captured <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>and</b> the spunky bravado of the original". Sullivan was another fan of [...] "the sheer awesomeness of Darren Criss" [...] on the song, and {{characterized}} it as [...] "a tribute that's more respectful than any other in the episode". Chaney dissented from the general approval; she gave it a [...] "C+" [...] and wrote that [...] "the number was appropriately big and splashy, but musically, it sounded like all the funk had been drained right out of it". She described [...] "Bad" [...] similarly as she gave it a [...] "C−": [...] "this tune also sounded noticeably defunkified". Sullivan was also unimpressed; he wrote that the performance let [...] "the world know what 'Bad' sounds like after it's drained of every ounce of danger". Lynch gave it a [...] "B" [...] and wrote that [...] "as silly as a choreographed gang fight between teenagers in a parking lot sounds (and was), the choreography was crisp and the attitude was a lot of fun". Slezak also praised the fight choreography, and stated that he [...] "got chills" [...] when Santana sang the chorus, and gave the song a [...] "B+". Futterman noted the [...] "interesting twist" [...] in the song's arrangement [...] "thanks to the Warblers' penchant for a cappella", and said that [...] "Artie and Santana" [...] began their battle for [...] "vocal MVP of the episode" [...] with [...] "Bad". Votta described the number as [...] "up there with the Dreamgirls performance from earlier this season as one of the strangest and best things Glee has done".|$|E
500|$|... "Tallahassee" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many {{noting that the}} Florida story-line gave the series a focus. TV Equals noted that the episode was [...] "one of the best episodes of The Office this the season and [...] {{one of the better}} episodes from the last couple of seasons." [...] Brian Marder from Hollywood.com wrote a largely positive review, noting that [...] "Overall, tonight represented a significant step back in the right direction – and hope that maybe the series still has hope... More promisingly, the humor was top-notch, funnily similar to the effortless comedy of early seasons and refreshingly dissimilar to the forced, uncharacteristic stuff that has pervaded season 8." [...] Bret Davinger from the California Literary Review noted that [...] "A couple of weeks ago, I complained about The Office spending too much time away from the office. How was I to know that taking a trip to Tallahassee would produce probably the best episode of the season and maybe one of the best episodes of the past couple of seasons?" [...] Davinger went on to note that the change in scenery from the office set to Tallahassee was working for the series. In addition, he noted that episode did not feature any hints of Erin's desire to stay in Florida or Cathy's attempt to seduce Jim, a move he hoped would be permanent. [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "between 'Special Project' and 'Tallahassee' it’s fair to say that The Office is on a nice little run. Everything good and funny about last week's episode spilled over to 'Tallahassee'." [...] TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode four out of five stars. Despite praising the episode for coming [...] "together {{as one of the best}} Office episodes of the season," [...] he criticized Dwight's main plot, calling it [...] "not funny." [...] The Filtered Lens reviewer Matt Dougherty called the episode [...] "solid" [...] and noted [...] "While 'Tallahassee' was not quite as good as last week, it still is a step in the right direction for this struggling show." [...] He ultimately awarded the episode a 7 out of 10. Many reviews praised the episode's cold opening, with many critics calling it one of the funniest openings of the eighth season. What Culture! reviewer Jeffrey Kratzer, despite awarding the episode three out of five stars, wrote, Tallahassee' was so enjoyable (for the most part) that [...] next few episodes look to be <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>and</b> focused momentum we've been waiting for all season." ...|$|E
