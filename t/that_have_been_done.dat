25|$|Otherwise, Ford's {{works are}} {{characterized}} by an aversion to doing things <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> before. This is perhaps most notable in his two Star Trek novels, The Final Reflection (1984) and How Much for Just the Planet? (1987). The Final Reflection {{is the story of}} a small group of Klingons who prevent a war between the Klingon Empire and the Federation while the regular series characters are relegated to cameo appearances. (This novel introduced the fictional language Klingonaase.) In the comedic How Much for Just the Planet?, the Enterprise crew compete with a Klingon crew for control of a planet, whose colonists are not happy with this and defend their peace in inventive ways, which soon make everything a farce, including a Vaudevillian pie fight. The book includes song lyrics that satirize many 20th century stage musicals. Both novels present the Klingons in a more positive light, not just as the token evil menace of the week.|$|E

500|$|In 1755, {{during the}} French and Indian War, British troops {{under the command}} of General Edward Braddock {{completed}} the arduous task of building a road westward from Fort Cumberland. They largely followed an Indian trail known as Nemacolin's Path, expanding it to a [...] road using only hand tools. The road construction was part of the Braddock Expedition, which was the British campaign to seize Fort Duquesne from the French and Indian forces. Although the military expedition was a failure, the road continued to be used afterwards. However, with little maintenance being done on the road, it decayed over time until by the early nineteenth century little remained of the road. The route followed by Alt US40 today is very similar to the route followed by Braddock's Road, with the exceptions of various realignments <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to the road over the years. For example, Braddock's Road crossed directly over Haystack Mountain west of Cumberland rather than following the Cumberland Narrows as later roads did.|$|E

However, they were unable to before , which sees the introductions of Ultron and Vision in a similar manner to LMDs. For the fourth season, they particularly pushed the idea, and Whedon noted that the introduction of Ghost Rider and mysticism allowed the series to introduce new technology that could launch LMDs in a way deemed rewarding, so the Ghost Rider storyline [...] "dovetails" [...] into the LMD storyline. The S.H.I.E.L.D. program is introduced through the character Aida, an android. Additionally, with LMDs chosen as one of the pods for the season, Whedon said the writers questioned, [...] "what are all the things we could do? You don't want to do the ones <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> , and you don't want to leave any on the table." [...] One idea that [...] "we knew we wanted to have early on" [...] was to reveal that the majority of S.H.I.E.L.D. have been replaced at once.|$|E

Valtonen and Wanamo had previously worked with Böcker on the concerts in the Symphonic series, and Böcker has stated {{that if they had}} been unavailable for the project he would not have created Final Symphony at all. Hamauzu, in addition to arranging the Final Fantasy X music, was one of the composers of the original pieces he arranged. Uematsu, who composed music for all three games, served as a consultant for the project, though he did not arrange any pieces. When they first began the project, Böcker, Valtonen, and Wanamo took a few months to play through the games, watch playthrough videos, and read reviews and analyses of the games. They did not research other arrangements <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> of the pieces, as they feel the general approach to video game music orchestration is very different from their style. They then got together to propose which tracks would be arranged, and decide which soundtracks worked best as a piano concerto, a symphonic poem, or a symphony. They chose a symphonic poem for VI, a piano concerto for X, and a symphony in three movements for VII. Böcker gave the team direction, and coordinated the arrangers in discussing and deciding which tracks to arrange. During the process of actually creating the arrangements, however, Böcker was not involved; he feels that the arrangers are [...] "masters of their art" [...] and should have the freedom to create what they want. Nevertheless, the arrangers were communicating via e-mail sharing their work in progress with Böcker: [...] "If there are questions, or if they wish to know my opinion, I am there".|$|E

Systematic reviews have cited {{the lack of}} high quality research for the benefits and risks of water fluoridation and questions that are still unsettled. [...] A 2007 Nuffield Council on Bioethics report concluded that good evidence for or against water fluoridation is lacking. Researchers who oppose the practice state this as well. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report on fluoride in drinking water, these gaps in the fluoridation scientific literature fuel the controversy. John Doull, chairman of the 2006 National Research Council committee report on fluoride in drinking water, has stated a similar conclusion regarding {{the source of the}} controversy: [...] "In the scientific community, people tend to think this is settled. I mean, when the U.S. surgeon general comes out and says {{this is one of the}} 10 greatest achievements of the 20th century, that’s a hard hurdle to get over. But when we looked at the studies <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done,</b> we found that many of these questions are unsettled and we have much less information than we should, considering how long this [...] has been going on.

40|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} Scandinavian culture and Scandinavian literature has long ignored the engagement of the Nordic {{nations in the}} tradition of drama and performance in medieval Europe. Early drama history scholars like Sophus Birket Smith and G. E. Klemming made claims about a perceived lack of practice based on limited sources and most of the scholars who followed them have accepted those claims as valid. Unfortunately, Birket Smith and Klemming were working with an incomplete corpus and nineteenth-century ideas about what constituted “drama”. Later scholars such as Frederick and Lise-Lone Marker and Terry Gunnell have made great headway in expanding the concept of drama and performance within the field of Scandinavian studies while also clarifying what texts we do, in fact, still <b>have.</b> The work <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done,</b> however, <b>is</b> still far below the level of depth and complexity of work <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> with the study of medieval drama and performance in other language traditions.
