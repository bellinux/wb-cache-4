5|$|<b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>at</b> Village Bay {{is unusual}} in that its short stretch of summer sand recedes in winter, exposing the large {{boulders}} on which it rests. A survey of the beach in 1953 found only a single resident species, the crustacean isopod Eurydice pulchra.|$|E
5|$|While on leave, Newkirk {{visited his}} brother in Houston, Texas. Newkirk took a trip to <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>at</b> Galveston where he met his wife to be, Virginia Jane Dunham. Born in Lansing, Michigan, she was known as Jane or Janie.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1926, Rix Nicholas and Dorothy Richmond {{together}} {{returned to}} Australia. Energised by her success, Rix Nicholas purchased a car, filled its rear compartment with painting equipment, and the pair set out to paint the landscape, ranging from Canberra and the Monaro plains to the south, up into central Queensland. This included a publicity-attracting occasion where she painted figures on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>at</b> Bondi, reported by various publications including Australian magazine, The Home.|$|E
5|$|Captain Warburton-Lee {{was brought}} ashore but died {{after an hour}} from his head wounds. 139 other men managed to get ashore, {{although}} 26 were seriously wounded. Captain Warburton-Lee was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Hardy was lifted off <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>at</b> high tide and drifted {{to the head of}} Skjomen fjord where she capsized in shallow waters. The wreck was still visible as late as 1963.|$|E
5|$|Most of the gumfields were in Northland, Coromandel and Auckland, {{the site}} of the {{original}} kauri forests. Initially, the gum was readily accessible, commonly found lying on the ground. Captain Cook reported the presence of resinous lumps on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>at</b> Mercury Bay, Coromandel, in 1769, although he suspected it came from the mangroves, and missionary Samuel Marsden spoke of their presence in Northland in 1819.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} ships {{continued to}} Red Beach, arriving on schedule at 23:00. On {{their way back}} USS LST-452 and LST-458 took the two crippled LSTs in tow, and brought them back to Morobe. They then took on their cargo, and later took it to Red Beach. The wounded were taken to Buna by Humphreys. Japanese aircraft attacked <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>at</b> 15:30. An ammunition dump exploded and a fuel dump was set on fire. The 532nd EBSR lost one man killed and 12 wounded.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} December 1883, a {{humpback}} whale appeared in the Firth of Tay off Dundee, attracting much local interest. It was harpooned, but after an all-night struggle escaped. A week later it was found dead, and was towed on to <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>at</b> Stonehaven, near Aberdeen. Struthers quickly visited the carcass, measuring it as 40 feet long with a tail 11 feet 4 inches wide. Struthers {{was not able to}} start dissecting it at once, as a local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale and took it to his yard in Dundee, where on the first Sunday, 12,000 people paid to see it.|$|E
5|$|Before Rommel was {{assigned}} {{defense of the}} Atlantic Wall, obstacles to amphibious landing were being built upon the beaches of Belgium and France. On February 3, 1944 {{during a visit to}} <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>at</b> Neufchâtel-Hardelot, Rommel was shown a method by which local troops employed a high pressure water hose to quickly create a hole in beach sand, one which could be used to set high wooden stakes (Hochpfähle) into the beach as an obstacle to landing craft. The water hose method took three minutes, fifteen times faster than using a pile driver. Rommel ordered such methods to be used to place wooden beams, metal rails and other obstructions along the beaches of Normandy. Nearly 11,000 were emplaced in the south part of Normandy's coastline where the Allies would eventually land.|$|E

5|$|Normally sea duty alternated with {{periods of}} duty ashore. In 1950, Shepard was {{selected}} to attend the United States Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. As a test pilot he conducted high-altitude tests to obtain information about the light and air masses at different altitudes over North America; carrier suitability certification of the McDonnell F2H Banshee; experiments with the Navy's new in-flight refueling system; and tests of the angled flight deck. He narrowly avoided being court-martialed by the station commander, Rear Admiral Alfred M. Pride, after looping the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and making low passes over <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>at</b> Ocean City, Maryland, and the base; but Shepard's superiors, John Hyland and Robert M. Elder, interceded on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|Papa Stour is {{the subject}} of a 1299 {{manuscript}} written in Old Norse, which is the oldest surviving document from Shetland. It deals with a dramatic incident in the house of Duke Hakon Magnusson, who was later to become King Hakon V of Norway. There is a circle of stones near <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>at</b> Housa Voe, which are the remains of a 'ting', or local assembly. This was the scene of a duel, fought and won by Lord Thorvald Thoresson, who was accused of corruption in the 1299 document and was later called ‘dominus de Papay’. (The story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above.) The remains of Duke Hakon's thirteenth-century house are still visible near Housa Voe.|$|E
5|$|Stora Henriksvik, {{also called}} the Bellman museum (Bellmanmuseet) for its small {{permanent}} Bellman exhibition, celebrates his life and work with paintings, replica objects and a beachside café in a 17th-century Stockholm house. The place, beside <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>at</b> Långholm, was in Bellman's time called Lilla Sjötullen (The Small Lake-Customs House) where farmers from Lake Mälaren had to pay a toll on the goods they were taking to market in Stockholm's Gamla stan. The place is mentioned in Epistle No. 48, Solen glimmar blank och trind.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd Devons {{arrived at}} 08:15, while {{the beach was}} still under heavy fire. One company stayed {{to help with the}} assault on Le Hamel, while the rest moved to capture the village of Ryes astride the road to Bayeux. Ryes was {{captured}} at around 16:30. The 1st Dorsets attacked a German position on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>at</b> La Cabane des Douanes and headed inland to arc westward toward the high ground south of Arromanches. They cleared enemy positions at Le Bulot and Puits d'Hérode, and arrived at their destination late in the morning. Joined by elements of the 1st Hampshires and covered by indirect fire from the naval forces offshore, they took Arromanches late in the afternoon.|$|E
5|$|The jubilation {{with which}} Greeks had hailed their king at the {{beginning}} of the war was reversed in defeat. For a time, he considered abdication. It was not until the King faced down an assassination attempt on 27 February 1898 with great bravery that his subjects again held their monarch in high esteem. Returning from a trip to <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>at</b> Phaleron in an open carriage, George and his daughter Maria were shot at by two riflemen. The King tried to shield his daughter; both were unhurt though the coachman and a horse were wounded. The gunmen (an Athens clerk called Karditzis and his assistant) fled into the Hymettus hills but they were spotted and arrested. Both were beheaded at Nauplia.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} gradient between Carrie {{and the high}} pressure area to its north produced gusty northeasterly winds, and by extension high seas. In response, the National Weather Service issued small craft warnings starting on September 1 and extending from Massachusetts to the Carolinas. Gale warnings were posted the next day from southern New Jersey to the coast of central New England, and the small craft warnings were brought north to Maine. Ongoing, {{as well as the}} threat of continued heavy rainfall necessitated the issuance of flash flood watches throughout eastern Massachusetts, southeastern New Hampshire, and southern and central Maine on September 3. Due to rough surf, <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>at</b> Virginia Beach, Virginia was closed to swimmers on August 31.|$|E

5|$|Though {{far from}} the United States, Dolly managed to bring heavy rain and high winds to {{southern}} Texas. Weekly rainfall totals in Corpus Christi reached 5.53in (141mm) and 2.82in (71.6mm) in Brownsville. Corpus Christi daily rainfall measurements on August23 and August24 were as high as 1.92in (48.8mm) and 2.55in (64.8), respectively, a new daily record. <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>at</b> the Padre Island National Seashore was closed after high tides began flooding the beaches and the John F. Kennedy Causeway, though other facilities such as the campground remained open. A tornado was spawned near Olmito, damaging a few homes and unroofing two others. Later, while passing north of Rancho Viejo, the twister inflicted impact on 10dwellings and knocked over trees and signs.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the state, federal {{agencies}} which allow alcohol sales {{do not have}} a system of liquor licenses or alcoholic beverage control boards, but instead simply award contracts to business per federal procurement laws. New Jersey does not consider municipal ordinances to be criminal offenses, and so open container laws cannot be enforced in federal enclaves under the Assimilative Crimes Act. Public consumption of alcohol is allowed on federal lands, except when in an automobile, or when the park superintendent has prohibited open containers in an area. For example, it is legal to consume alcoholic beverages on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>at</b> Sandy Hook.|$|E
5|$|Wrecking and {{smuggling}} supplemented local incomes. In 1743 John Roberts and Huw Bedward from Y Rhiw {{were found}} guilty {{of the murder of}} two shipwrecked sailors on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>at</b> Porth Neigwl on 6 January 1742, and hanged; Jonathan Morgan had been killed by a knife thrust into the nape of his neck, and Edward Halesham, described as a boy, had been choked to death. A ship claimed to be from France unloaded illicit tea and brandy at Aberdaron in 1767, and attempted to sell its cargo to the locals; a Revenue cutter discovered salt being smuggled at Porth Cadlan in 1809; and a schooner en route from Guernsey to Scotland was reported to have offloaded lace, tea, brandy and gin at Y Rhiw in 1824.|$|E
5|$|Poole's {{wide and}} sandy beaches {{are used for}} swimming, sunbathing, water sports and sailing. <b>The</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>at</b> Sandbanks are often used for {{sporting}} events such as <b>the</b> Sandbanks <b>Beach</b> Volleyball Festival, and <b>the</b> annual British <b>Beach</b> polo Championship.|$|R
