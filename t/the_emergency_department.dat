5|$|As the air {{ambulance}} prepares to land outside <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>department</b> a rotor blade {{is struck by}} a drone, causing the helicopter to crash land {{in the parking lot}} outside the hospital and into the back of an ambulance, causing the ambulance to knock scaffolding down over Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). The tail of the helicopter smashes into the entrance of <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>department</b> causing brutal injuries. The department is shut down following the incident, with Connie and Grace’s lives prioritised. Grace is freed from the helicopter and taken into the department for treatment. Connie learns Grace has life-threatening injuries and may not survive surgery. The staff at Holby City come together to treat casualties of the accident. Grace survives surgery, but remains in a critical condition.|$|E

Results of the study revealed that majority of the patients (75. 2 %) did not find doctor in <b>the</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Departments</b> immediately and in 94. 3 % cases they found either Medical Assistant (MA) or Nurse or Pharmacist. 5. 7 % patients did not find any health personnel in <b>the</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Departments</b> immediately. 55 % attending <b>the</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Departments</b> did not receive doctors’ service.

As Iain and Jez search for Grace they find her in a critical condition and call for an air ambulance to escort her to hospital.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} in {{the emergency}} setting can be difficult with the fiberoptic bronchoscope due to blood, vomit, or secretions in the airway and poor patient cooperation. Because of this, patients with massive facial injury, complete upper airway obstruction, severely diminished ventilation, or profuse upper airway bleeding are poor candidates for fiberoptic intubation. Fiberoptic intubation under general anesthesia typically requires two skilled individuals. Success rates of only 83–87% have been reported using fiberoptic techniques in <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>department,</b> with significant nasal bleeding occurring in up to 22% of patients. These drawbacks limit the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy somewhat in urgent and emergency situations.|$|E

40|$|The rapidly {{increasing}} demand {{for health care}} in the province of Ontario has led to greater numbers of patients turning to public hospitals for the care they need. The primary entrance for them into the public hospital system is through <b>Emergency</b> <b>Departments.</b> <b>The</b> poor performance of public hospital <b>Emergency</b> <b>Departments</b> in handling <b>the</b> demands put on them calls into question the quality of <b>the</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Departments.</b> Assuming that <b>the</b> management of hospitals focuses their attention and resources on problem areas, the quality of management in <b>the</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Departments</b> are likely symptomatic {{of the quality of the}} management throughout the hospital. Ultimately, responsibility for the quality of management in the hospital rests with the board of directors and is a matter of governance.

5|$|Low {{back pain}} results in large {{economic}} costs. In the United States, {{it is the}} most common type of pain in adults, responsible for a large number of missed work days, and is the most common musculoskeletal complaint seen in <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>department.</b> In 1998, it was estimated to be responsible for $90 billion in annual health care costs, with 5% of individuals incurring most (75%) of the costs. Between 1990 and 2001 there was a more than twofold increase in spinal fusion surgeries in the US, despite the fact that there were no changes to the indications for surgery or new evidence of greater usefulness. Further costs occur in the form of lost income and productivity, with low back pain responsible for 40% of all missed work days in the United States. Low back pain causes disability in a larger percentage of the workforce in Canada, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden than in the US or Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at <b>the</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Department</b> of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related {{to the use of}} benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of this study and others like it showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.|$|E

30|$|Nurses usually {{work one}} of three shifts: days (7  a.m.– 3  p.m.), evenings (3  p.m.– 11  p.m.), or nights (11  p.m.– 7  a.m.), weekdays and weekends in Danish hospitals. Physicians usually work two shifts: days (8  a.m.– 4  p.m.) or evenings/nights (4  p.m.– 8  a.m.). Møllekær et al. (2018) show that <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>department’s</b> {{organizational}} design on weekday day-shifts differ {{from the rest of}} the shifts. The empirical material in this study confirms this.
