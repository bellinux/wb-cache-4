30|$|During the Early Triassic period, the {{periphery}} of the basin has not changed greatly, and the basin remained relatively deep in the east and shallow in the west. The Jialingjiang Formation can be divided into five lithologic sections in stratigraphic order, namely <b>T</b> 1 <b>j</b> 1 –T 1 j 5. The first and third sections (<b>T</b> 1 <b>j</b> 1 and <b>T</b> 1 <b>j</b> 3) are composed of micritic limestone, bioclastic limestone, and oolitic limestone, while the second, fourth, and fifth sections (<b>T</b> 1 <b>j</b> 2, <b>T</b> 1 <b>j</b> 4, and <b>T</b> 1 <b>j</b> 5) are composed of dolomite, gypsum, and evaporite-solution breccia. With accretion of the adjacent platform, the basin shallowed. Limestone, dolomite, gypsum, and halite developed across a majority of the basin producing two vertical assemblages of limestone–dolomite–gypsum and halite, whereas, in the northwestern margin of basin, the <b>T</b> 1 <b>j</b> 1 and <b>T</b> 1 <b>j</b> 2 facies transition, and mainly form gray–brown and purplish red micrite limestone. During the Jialingjiang period, oolitic shoals, bioclastic shoals, and calcarenite shoals were widely distributed throughout the basin. These lithofacies become favorable locations for oil and gas accumulation during post-depositional diagenesis (Tian 1989; Tan et al. 2011).|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the production of}} a single top quark in association with a Higgs boson at the LHC.

We find that the anomalous Wtb and tth couplings can enhance the cross sections significantly. We also analyze a few signatures and show that, if these couplings are indeed anomalous, then with enough data, one should be able to observe the production of the Higgs boson in association with single top quark.
