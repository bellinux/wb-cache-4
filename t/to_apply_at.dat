25|$|Scattering and {{absorption}} {{are major}} {{causes of the}} attenuation of radiation by the atmosphere. Scattering varies {{as a function of}} the ratio of the particle diameter of the wavelength of the radiation. When this ratio is less than about one-tenth, Rayleigh scattering occurs. In this case, the scattering coefficient varies inversely with the fourth power of the wavelength. At larger ratios, scattering varies in a complex fashion, described for spherical particles by the Mie theory; the laws of geometric optics begin <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>at</b> a ratio of the order of 10.|$|E
25|$|With few impediments, {{the flow}} of Cuban and Spanish workers and their {{families}} {{back and forth between}} Florida and Cuba was both substantial and largely undocumented. Despite V.M. Ybor's efforts to anchor his employees in Tampa through home ownership, many Ybor City cigar workers were still open to heading back to Cuba to seek out better wages and conditions into the 1890s. Due to this divided national loyalty, it would be years before many of the early residents of Ybor City became American citizens, and many never saw reason <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>at</b> all. In the largely insular community, immigrants could live surrounded by their own culture, so attachment to their countries of origin remained high, especially in the first generation.|$|E
25|$|Some colleges {{offer this}} type of admission, {{typically}} used by schools {{with large numbers of}} applicants, which means that colleges are continually receiving applications and making decisions, typically within four to six weeks after application. It allows prospective students <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>at</b> any time between the fall and spring and to receive their result a few weeks later. One benefit is that if a student is accepted early in the school year, there is less anxiety about acceptance {{for the rest of the}} year. Rolling admission schools are also beneficial to students who are rejected from all the schools they applied regularly to, yet still wish to enroll without taking a gap year. Guidance counselors suggest that rolling admissions should not be used late in twelfth grade since financial aid money may have already been distributed, and few slots may be left for September. One advisor suggests that if a college offers rolling admissions and is on a student's list, then it should be applied to as soon as rolling admissions becomes available for that year. Another report suggested that rolling admissions was more characteristic of noncompetitive colleges.|$|E

2500|$|Bekele's eight year [...]africa {{journey was}} not without a trial. She has fought many {{challenges}} by her opponents over the issues of accountability and transparency on the bid for [...]africa, including the African Union Commission(AUC). For instance, on April 24, 2014, during the International ICT Girls day, the AUC blocked Bekele from speaking at an ITU event that was held on the AUC premises in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, due to a dispute over the [...]africa. Bekele has been challenging the AUC, who allegedly disavowed the first endorsement they gave her organization DotConnectAfrica in 2009 <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>at</b> ICANN for the [...]africa gTLD, to subsequently request for the same directly from ICANN, at the ICANN 42 International meeting held in Dakar Senegal from 23–28 October 2011. AUC requested from ICANN to include all similar name strings [...] ".africa", [...] ".afrique" [...] and [...] ".afriqia", {{in the list of}} [...] "reserved names", to afford special legislative protection to the AUC to own these strings so as to make it unavailable to anyone, through a method of bypassing the formal application process of the ICANN's new generic top level domains (gTLDs). [...] Bekele strongly opposed to the AUC's request to reserve the names saying the request was against the ICANN gTLD rule book, thus reserving the name will disqualify all competition to enable the AUC to separately negotiate the delegation of these name strings under a separate process outside the aegis of the official ICANN new gTLD programme. Bekele came victorious on this battle at ICANN Dakar, as it became known later that ICANN could not reserve the names for the AU, however ICANN did recommend to the AUC to use Government Advisory Committee to raise concerns that an applicant is seen as potentially sensitive or problematic, or to provide direct advice to the Board, so as to change the outcome of the gTLD. which AUC implemented the advice during the GAC objection period, to the detriment of DCA's application. [...] In addition, failing to secure the reserve names, the AUC then directly endorsed another firm from SouthAfrica to apply to ICANN, who was also supported by its own AU Dotafrica Task Force. [...] According to the public part of their application, the South African company submitted a [...] "non-community" [...] application to ICANN naming AUC as a “co-applicant” and giving the [...]africa registry and intellectual property rights to the AUC in a separate contract Bekele's organization then challenged the ICANN application process for the competition, through the official channels of ICANN, as well as challenged the AUC's RFP process that gave a direct endorsement for the SouthAfrican company by requesting full disclosure of the process with the AU leadership and ICANN Governmental Committee, in the interest of accountability and transparency to the global public at large ...|$|E
