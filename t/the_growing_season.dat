5|$|The {{climate of}} Willamette Valley is mild year-round, with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers; extreme {{temperatures}} are uncommon. Most rainfall occurs outside <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> and the valley gets relatively little snow.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to test the effects of different plant densities on stem characteristics in two growing seasons: Fall/Winter and Spring/Summer. The plant densities evaluated were 48, 64, 80, 96, 112 and 128 plants m- 2. <b>The</b> Fall/Winter <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> was from 04 / 04 / 2008 to 23 / 08 / 2008 and <b>the</b> Spring/Summer <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> was from 03 / 10 / 2008 to 23 / 12 / 2008.

5|$|As the {{landscape}} rises, trees become {{smaller and more}} sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, and mountain hemlock that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> is short, but species such as pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed jackrabbit, Clark's nutcracker, and black rosy finch are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.|$|E
5|$|Different soil types suit {{different}} crops, but {{in general}} in temperate climates, sandy soils dry out fast but warm up quickly {{in the spring and}} are suitable for early crops, while heavy clays retain moisture better and are more suitable for late season crops. <b>The</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> can be lengthened by the use of fleece, cloches, plastic mulch, polytunnels, and greenhouses. In hotter regions, the production of vegetables is constrained by the climate, especially the pattern of rainfall, while in temperate zones, it is constrained by the temperature and day length.|$|E
5|$|In cool {{temperate}} regions, conifers often predominate; {{a widely}} distributed climax {{community in the}} far north of the northern hemisphere is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal forest). Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's forest cover. The long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover {{and there may be}} little plant life on the forest floor, although fungi may abound. Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E

50|$|All cultivars of {{raspberries}} have perennial roots but, {{many do not}} have perennial shoots.

40|$|Rotation is an {{effective}} way to manage many soybean diseases because it breaks the disease cycle and lowers the amount of pathogen in a field. In <b>the</b> 2000 <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> in Iowa, several diseases occurred in soybean fields and some were prevalent. Many growers rotated these fields with corn in <b>the</b> 2001 <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> to reduce disease risk. Some growers may have continued planting soybean despite of the occurrence of diseases. These fields would return to soybean in <b>the</b> 2002 <b>growing</b> <b>season...</b>|$|R
5|$|Other {{cultural}} controls {{may be used}} {{in combination}} with crop rotation: Mulching the potato crop with straw early in <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> may reduce the beetle’s ability to locate potato fields, and the mulch creates an environment that favours beetle's predators; Plastic-lined trenches have been used as pitfall traps to catch the beetles as they move toward a field of potatoes in the spring, exploiting their inability to fly immediately after emergence; Flamethrowers may also be used to kill the beetles when they are visible {{at the top of the}} plant's foliage.|$|E
5|$|Routine care during <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> {{involves}} {{keeping the}} rows free of competing weeds, {{especially when the}} plants are young. The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need {{a great deal of}} water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be kept in storage, they should be harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left {{on the surface of the}} soil for a few days to dry out properly, then they can be placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. They should be stored in a well-ventilated, cool place such as a shed.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard has {{permafrost}} and tundra, {{with both}} low, {{middle and high}} Arctic vegetation. 165 species of plants have been found on the archipelago. Only those areas which defrost in the summer have vegetations, which accounts for about 10% of the archipelago. Vegetation is most abundant in Nordenskiöld Land, around Isfjorden and where affected by guano. While there is little precipitation, giving the archipelago a steppe climate, plants still have good access to water because the cold climate reduces evaporation. <b>The</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> is very short, and may last only a few weeks.|$|E
50|$|Seedlings {{held over}} for either growth {{for another year}} into the spring are {{particularly}} susceptible to cedar leaf blight infection and expression. Held-over seedlings must be protected throughout <b>the</b> previous <b>growing</b> <b>season,</b> or disease expression will occur early in the spring. The first signs of the disease are often subtle and overlooked {{in the early spring}} and the disease can easily spread. By applying fungicides to the crop in <b>the</b> first <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> and continuing through <b>the</b> second <b>growing</b> <b>season,</b> a disease-free crop of 2+0 western red cedar can be produced.|$|R

5|$|The {{habitat of}} Novisuccinea chittenangoensis lies within the ravine {{at the base}} of the 167-foot-tall {{waterfall}} formed by Chittenango Creek as it flows north from its origin toward Oneida Lake. This north-south oriented ravine forms a deep gorge that is shaded or partially shaded throughout most of <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season,</b> resulting in a microclimate that stays relatively cool during the summer, and because of the creek flow and ice formations, is relatively warm in the winter compared to the surrounding area. Spring thaws and periodic major rainfall events tend to remove vegetation from significant portions of the primary Novisuccinea chittenangoensis habitat.|$|E
5|$|Their native {{habitats}} {{are very}} varied, with different elevations, bioclimatic areas and substrates, being found predominantly in open spaces ranging from low marshes to rocky hillsides and montane pastures, and including grassland, scrub, woods, river banks and rocky crevices. Although requirements vary, overall {{there is a}} preference for acidic soils, although some species will grow on limestone. Narcissus scaberulus will grow on granite soils where it is moist in <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> but dry in the summer, while Narcissus dubius thrives best in regions with hot and dry summers.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{are either}} evergreen, having foliage that {{persists}} and remains green throughout the year, or deciduous, shedding their leaves {{at the end}} of <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> and then having a dormant period without foliage. Most conifers are evergreens but larches (Larix and Pseudolarix) are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis. The crown is a name for the spreading top of a tree including the branches and leaves, while the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is known as the canopy. A sapling is a young tree.|$|E
50|$|Initial {{growth of}} the {{seedlings}} is slow. Field observations indicated {{that by the end}} of <b>the</b> third <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> <b>the</b> seedlings were about 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) tall and by <b>the</b> eighth <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> they were only 30 to 40 cm (12 to 16 in) high.|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} {{numerous}} rocky outcrops some farming was successfully established within the Great Clay Belt, however, {{it proved to}} be impractical because of <b>the</b> short <b>growing</b> <b>season.</b> <b>The</b> clay soil is tremendously fertile, but long snowy winters coupled with unpredictable rainfall during <b>the</b> short <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> meant most farming yielded little.|$|R
40|$|Field {{population}} {{densities of}} Ditylenchus dipsaci associated with shoot tissue of Phlox subulata were monitored during two consecutive <b>growing</b> <b>seasons</b> and intervening periods of overwintering and plant storage. The population density increased significantly through four peaks during <b>the</b> first <b>growing</b> <b>season,</b> and decreased significantly during storage at 5 - 7 C or overwintering in the field. During <b>the</b> second <b>growing</b> <b>season,</b> {{there was only}} a single increase to a moderate population density, followed by a severe population decline associated with the poor physiological condition of the host. A simple model is proposed to explain the population dynamics of D. dipsaci during <b>the</b> first <b>growing</b> <b>season...</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between {{the growth rate of}} newly metamorphosed juveniles from different altitudes and latitudes, the specimens studied being from Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France. At first the growth rates for males and females was identical. By the time they became mature their growth rate had slowed down to about 21% of the initial rate and they had reached 95% of their expected adult size. Some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on growing rapidly for a longer time. Adjusting for differences in temperature and the length of <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season,</b> the toads grew and matured at much the same rate from the four colder localities. These juveniles reached maturity after 1.09 years for males and 1.55 years for females. However, the young toads from lowland France grew faster and longer to a much greater size taking an average 1.77 years for males and 2.49 years for females before reaching maturity.|$|E
5|$|Famines became {{common in}} {{northern}} China {{in the early}} 17th century because of unusually dry and cold weather that shortened <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> – effects of a larger ecological event {{now known as the}} Little Ice Age. Famine, alongside tax increases, widespread military desertions, a declining relief system, and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility. The central government, starved of resources, could do very little to mitigate the effects of these calamities. Making matters worse, a widespread epidemic spread across China from Zhejiang to Henan, killing an unknown but large number of people. The deadliest earthquake of all time, the Shaanxi earthquake of 1556, occurred during the Jiajing Emperor's reign, killing approximately 830,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Farming in Egypt was {{dependent}} on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: Akhet (flooding), Peret (planting), and Shemu (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops. From March to May, farmers used sickles to harvest their crops, which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain. Winnowing removed the chaff from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.|$|E
30|$|In {{previous}} studies (Lee and Sohn 2011), <b>the</b> average <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> NDVI was usually used {{to indicate the}} vegetation condition during the dust storm <b>season.</b> <b>The</b> average <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> NDVI is primarily determined by vegetation growth in summer, when vegetation greenness reaches its maximum. The variation of the NDVI during the dust storm season has limited influence on <b>the</b> average <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> NDVI. <b>The</b> average spring NDVI is dampened by the poor vegetation conditions before the green-up date when plant leaves begin to turn green after winter dormancy, which fails to represent the actual vegetation conditions during the dust storm <b>season.</b> Both <b>the</b> average <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> NDVI and <b>the</b> average spring NDVI are not temporally matched with the dust storm prevailing season in East Asia. Therefore, <b>the</b> average <b>growing</b> season/spring NDVI could not accurately characterize the restrictive effects of vegetation growth on spring dust storms (Fan et al. 2014).|$|R
30|$|I {{monitored}} {{seedling emergence}} and survival weekly {{for the first}} month after planting, and every two weeks {{for the remainder of}} <b>the</b> first <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> and through <b>the</b> second <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> (mid-July through early September 2002). No new germination occurred during 2003, but I continued to monitor survival monthly through <b>the</b> summer <b>growing</b> <b>season.</b> I marked seedlings with color-coded toothpicks and located them on plot maps upon their emergence in order to monitor survival. I calculated survival as total surviving seedlings relative to total emergence. Emergence included all seed germinants, even if they produced no more than cotyledons.|$|R
50|$|Winter is the driest season, {{averaging}} about 6 {{inches of}} total precipitation. Springtime (March through May), is typically the wettest season, with just under 10.5 inches. Dry spells {{of one or}} two weeks duration are common during <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>seasons.</b>|$|R
5|$|Geopyxis carbonaria is {{widespread}} on burned soil or charcoal {{in the spring}} and throughout <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season.</b> It {{is one of the most}} common pioneer species found on burned ground. The charred litter on the forest floor increases the underlying soil pH as well as the availability of minerals. Fruitbodies are produced from 16 to 139 weeks after a forest fire in areas with coniferous trees. Most fruitbodies are produced in the first year after a burn. The fungus prefers fruiting in microhabitats with thin postfire duff near standing burned tree trunks. Geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post-fire stands as morels, although the former is usually more abundant. Because the pixie cup fruits earlier than morels, it may serve as an indicator of imminent morel fruiting. Other cup fungi often found fruiting in the same area as G.carbonaria include those from the genera Aleuria, Anthracobia, Peziza, and Tarzetta.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{elevation}} forests contain whitebark pine, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and limber pine, including the largest individual whitebark pine in North America. Based on tree ring chronologies, {{some of the}} whitebark pines {{are believed to be}} 700 to 1000 or more years old. The {{highest elevation}} forests typically have understories of grasses and forbs that are resistant to freezing at any point of <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season.</b> Willows, alders, cottonwoods, and sedges are found in riparian areas. Ponderosa pine occupy the dry, lower elevations near {{the western edge of the}} forest and historically persisted due to the occurrence of frequent non-lethal fires. Ponderosa pine forest understories typically consist of perennial grasses such as Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass. In the slightly moister ponderosa pine forests grasses such as pinegrass are found with a cover of shrubs including white spirea, common snowberry, and mallow ninebark.|$|E
5|$|The mild seas that {{surround}} Portland act to keep night-time temperatures above freezing, making winter frost rare: on average 9.6 days per year— {{this is far}} below the United Kingdom's average annual total of 55.6 days of frost. Days with snow lying are equally rare: on average zero to six days per year; almost all winters have {{no more than one}} day with snow lying. It may snow or sleet in winter, yet it almost never settles on the ground—coastal areas in South West England such as Portland generally experience the mildest winters in the UK. Portland is less affected by the Atlantic storms that Devon and Cornwall experience. <b>The</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> lasts for more than 310 days per year, and the borough is in Hardiness zone 9.|$|E
