5|$|Concurrent {{programming}} languages, libraries, APIs, {{and parallel}} programming models (such as algorithmic skeletons) {{have been created}} for programming parallel computers. These can generally be divided into classes based on the assumptions they make about the underlying memory architecture—shared memory, distributed memory, or shared distributed memory. Shared memory programming languages communicate by manipulating shared memory variables. Distributed memory uses message passing. POSIX Threads and OpenMP are two of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>used</b> shared memory APIs, whereas Message Passing Interface (MPI) is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>used</b> message-passing system API. One concept used in programming parallel programs is the future concept, where {{one part of a}} program promises to deliver a required datum to another part of a program at some future time.|$|E

5|$|Political Economy, {{the first}} edition {{published}} in 1883, was one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>used</b> textbooks of the 19th century {{as a component of}} the American Science Series.

5|$|Publisher Kaspar Braun, who {{commissioned}} Busch's first illustrations, {{had established}} the first workshop in Germany to use wood engraving.

In a nasotracheal procedure, an endotracheal tube is passed through the nose and vocal apparatus into the trachea. Other methods of intubation involve surgery and include the cricothyrotomy (used almost exclusively in emergency circumstances) and the tracheotomy, used primarily in situations where a prolonged need for airway support is anticipated.|$|E

Alpha transparency blends the eyebrows into the face smoothly and elegantly. This was a significant issue because Internet Explorer 6, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>used</b> web browser at the time Acid2 was released, did not support alpha transparency. This deficiency was rectified in Internet Explorer 7, bringing Internet Explorer in line with other web browsers in this regard.|$|E

Other aircraft were employed: for air support the T6 and the Fiat G.91 were used; for reconnaissance, the Dornier Do 27.

5|$|Hexagonal BN (h-BN) is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>used</b> polymorph. It {{is a good}} {{lubricant}} at both low {{and high}} temperatures (up to 900°C, even in an oxidizing atmosphere). h-BN lubricant is particularly useful when the electrical conductivity or chemical reactivity of graphite (alternative lubricant) would be problematic. Another advantage of h-BN over graphite is that its lubricity does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore, h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The lubricating properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in cosmetics, paints, dental cements, and pencil leads.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>widely</b> <b>used</b> vaccine worldwide, {{with more}} than 90% of all {{children}} being vaccinated. The immunity it induces decreases after about ten years. As tuberculosis is uncommon in most of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, BCG is administered to only those people at high risk. Part of the reasoning {{against the use of}} the vaccine is that it makes the tuberculin skin test falsely positive, reducing the test's use in screening. A number of new vaccines are currently in development.|$|E
