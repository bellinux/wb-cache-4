5|$|Low budgets, generally: Taken and Paul Blarts stars, Liam Neeson and Kevin James respectively, are not {{considered}} A-listers, bankable enough to open a major movie on <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> names alone. Therefore, Meslow writes, they work for lower salaries, which helps keep budgets low enough for the film to be profitable with a smaller potential audience amid minimal competition.|$|E

Once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft, {{this time a}} full-fledged space station.

5|$|Some historians contend {{the goals}} of the North Koreans at the Pusan Perimeter were {{unattainable}} from the beginning. According to historian T. R. Fehrenbach, the Americans, who had been better equipped than the North Koreans, were easily able to defeat their opponents once they had the chance to form a continuous line. At the same time, the North Koreans did break through the perimeter at several points and were able to exploit their gains for a short time. Within a week, though, the momentum of the offensive had been slowed and the North Koreans could not keep up <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> attacks. Most of the front saw only probing actions {{for the remainder of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|Both {{inside and}} outside battle, characters' {{relationships}} can be developed through interactions {{on and off the}} battlefield. As <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> relationships grow, certain abilities in battle are also strengthened. A feature introduced in Genealogy of the Holy War and used in later titles was an aspect of relationships. A man and woman who fall in love will have a child, and that child will inherit certain skills and stats from them. One of the recurring features in the series is permanent death, a function in which units defeated in battle are permanently removed {{from the rest of the}} game with very few exceptions (the main character, a character pivotal to the main story). Up until Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem: Heroes of Light and Shadow, there was no option to disable permanent death. In New Mystery of the Emblem, a new Casual Mode was added, in which characters that died were revived at the end of a battle. Fates also added Phoenix Mode, in which characters slain during one turn are revived on the player's next turn. Another inclusion from Fates includes 'My Castle', a customisable castle that serves as the player's base of operations throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Playford, used to {{cooperating}} with Labor leaders more than attacking them, sensed Dunstan's promise and, predicting {{that one day}} Dunstan {{would be at the}} helm, attempted to establish bonds. So, after a late session of parliament at night, Playford would give Dunstan a lift home in his car. As Dunstan's home was situated on George Street, Norwood, it was only a small deviance from Playford's normal route to his home in Norton Summit. The topics that the two discussed were not ever completely revealed, yet Playford, according to Dunstan, would talk to him in a paternalistic manner. The two built up somewhat of a relationship and developed a respect for each other, but due to <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> respective views (Playford was a liberal conservative, Dunstan a libertarian socialist), did not establish the same type of bond that Playford had with earlier Laborites.|$|E

5|$|Rather {{than the}} typical {{experience}} point-driven character growth of most role-playing games, each characters' abilities is linked to their Psyphers, {{and the amount of}} damage characters can inflict depends upon <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Psypher. These two elements are upgraded by collecting Phozons, spirit energy released from defeated enemies. Phozons fill a magic meter, which is used to trigger special skills. All physical attacks drain a character's POW (power) gauge, and if depleted entirely the character must rest until the gauge refills. Tied to Phozons and leveling is a farming system, where seeds planted and fueled with Phozons provide meals which raise a character's level, boosting their health and abilities. Food can be grown in the wild using seeds, but later two restaurants are available where prepared meals can be eaten. Various elements, such as food and material, can be used together using an Alchemy system which allows for the creation of potions with various effects, from dealing damage to healing the main character.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} among historians that Bhimsen was not behind the poisoning. Bhimsen had nothing to gain by killing an infant less a year old, and the accusation was simply a ruse to answer foreign inquiries on Bhimsen's imprisonment. It was a general practice among the physicians of the time to check <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> medicine by first letting the mother taste it, before giving it to their new born. It was later rumored {{that it was the}} Junior Queen who had actually contrived to kill the Senior Queen by poisoning the medicine intended for her new born. While the poison did not express itself on the intended Queen, it managed to kill the infant prince, and the powerless Bhimsen was made a convenient scapegoat. Historian Gyanmani Nepal contends this to be closer to the truth.|$|E
5|$|The valence {{electrons}} of moscovium fall into three subshells: 7s (two electrons), 7p1/2 (two electrons), and 7p3/2 (one electron). The first {{two of these}} are relativistically stabilized and hence behave as inert pairs, while the last is relativistically destabilized and can easily participate in chemistry. (The 6d electrons are not destabilized enough to participate chemically, although this may still be possible in the two previous elements nihonium and flerovium.) Thus, the +1 oxidation state should be favored, like Tl+, and consistent with this the first ionization potential of moscovium should be around 5.58eV, continuing the trend towards lower ionization potentials down the pnictogens. Moscovium and nihonium both have one electron outside a quasi-closed shell configuration that can be delocalized in the metallic state: thus they should have similar melting and boiling points (both melting around 400°C and boiling around 1100°C) due to <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> metallic bonds being similar. Additionally, the predicted ionization potential, ionic radius (1.5Å for Mc+; 1.0Å for Mc3+), and polarizability of Mc+ {{are expected to be}} more similar to Tl+ than its true congener Bi3+. Moscovium should be a dense metal due to its high atomic weight, with a density around 13.5g/cm3. The electron of the hydrogen-like moscovium atom (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Mc114+) is expected to move so fast that it has a mass 1.82 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like bismuth and antimony are expected to be 1.25 and 1.077 respectively.|$|E

40|$|With a {{laboratory}} experiment, we study {{the impact of}} buy-options and the corresponding buy-price on revenues and bidding behavior in (online) proxy-auctions with independent private valuations.
