25|$|Makart's {{painting}} The Entry of Charles V into Antwerp {{caused some}} controversy, because Charles V was depicted arriving in a procession surrounded by nude virgins; the offense was the mistaken {{idea that the}} nudes had {{no place in the}} modern scene. In the United States, the painting fell under the proscription of Anthony Comstock, which secured Makart's fame there. The American public desired at once to see what Comstock was persecuting, so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> whether he was acting correctly or in error.|$|E
500|$|In June 1999, United {{accepted}} {{an offer from}} the FA {{to withdraw from the}} FA Cup in order to participate in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship, staged in Brazil. It was criticised by the new Sports minister Kate Hoey, who suggested the club were treating its supporters in a [...] "shabby way". Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson however replied that United had been pressurised to make the decision, which aimed to solidify England's 2006 FIFA World Cup bid: [...] "The Government are saying that we should be in the FA Cup, but they are the very people that were saying originally that {{we have to go to}} Brazil. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> us quite clearly: 'Do not bother about the World Cup bid, leave that to us. It should not be Manchester United's responsibility.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Kirkland was the {{director}} of [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace". He recalls that when he attended the table-read for the episode, the staff thought it was [...] "hilarious" [...] and <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> it was [...] "going to be a good one." [...] It was the last episode to be produced during the season nine production run and because it takes several months to complete the production of a single episode, it had to air as a hold-over in the upcoming tenth season. It was decided that [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] would be the premiere episode of season ten. As a result, the annual premiere party was held at the Museum of Science and Technology in Los Angeles – it was a tradition for the premiere party {{to be related to the}} premiere episode.|$|E
60|$|What {{impression}} {{the noise}} of the two muskets made among the Indians <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell,</b> for <b>they</b> were all run away before.|$|R
60|$|Several other shots followed, but <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> {{if anybody}} was hit. In the {{distance}} several rum-crazed sailors were yelling {{like so many}} Indians.|$|R
60|$|This was true, and {{all were}} in danger of going down. The ice was the most rotten they had yet encountered--why, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b>|$|R
500|$|Film {{producer}} Joel Silver {{has said}} that after working as scriptwriters on Assassins, the Wachowskis made Bound as an [...] "audition piece" [...] {{to prove that they}} knew what to do on a movie set. Conversely, Lana Wachowski has said Joel [...] "made that up." [...] The Wachowskis themselves claim they [...] "decided simply to focus on making their own directorial debut." [...] They had the idea to write a story about how one might see a woman on the street and make assumptions about her sexuality, but how those assumptions might be wrong. They wanted to play with stereotypes and make an entertaining film that contained sex and violence, because {{those are the kinds of}} films that they like to watch. Seeing film noir as a genre within which <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> a contained story and twist conventions, they described Billy Wilder as a big influence.|$|E
6000|$|The monk and nun {{they told}} their beads [...] As fast as <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> [...] And aye as louder grew the noise [...] The faster went the bell.|$|E
6000|$|... "He said," [...] replied Rollo, [...] "that {{she must}} go and ask Boreas and Neptune, {{and some of}} those fellows, for <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> a great deal better than he could." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> what <b>they</b> wanted, {{they did}} not know themselves, and the man would use bad language, and slam the door in their faces.|$|R
60|$|Dan {{was at one}} {{port-hole}} and Ralph at another, and {{now both}} fired simultaneously. Whether the shots were effective <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b> Certainly none of the Indians dropped.|$|R
60|$|Perseus sighed: he {{had gone}} so far, and endured so much, and {{had come to the}} Nymphs of the Isle of the West, and even <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> how to reach the Gorgons' island.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it-- now. But <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> mighty mean {{stories about}} {{me if they}} wanted to." [...] And Dick Blair turned away and shuffled {{his foot on the}} ground to hide his shame.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{walls of}} my Lodgings" [...] I {{says in a}} casual way--for my dear it is of no use going {{straight}} at a man who mopes--"might {{have something to tell}} if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|They hunted till {{darkness}} came on, {{but they}} found [...] Not a button, or feather, or mark, [...] By which <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that they stood on the ground [...] Where the Baker had met with the Snark.|$|E
60|$|She told Gerda {{not to be}} sad, {{and that}} she should stay with her and take of the cherry trees and flowers, which were better than any picture-bok, as <b>they</b> <b>could</b> each <b>tell</b> a story.|$|R
60|$|At {{the start}} the shouts of their pursuers had sounded unpleasantly close {{but now they}} died out utterly. But whether the redskins had given up the chase or were coming on in silence <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b>|$|R
60|$|Wondering {{what his}} friend {{had in mind}} to do, Chet {{followed}} Andy to where was located an ash sapling of fair size. It had been broken off about two feet above the ground--how, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b>|$|R
60|$|After that, {{one name}} after another was called, and every pupil said {{practically}} the same thing, even Plum and Poole stating that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> nothing. When the roll-call was finished, {{the teacher was}} fairly purple with suppressed rage.|$|E
6000|$|He had met {{these two}} {{boys at the}} corner of Cortlandt and West streets, in New York City, and had stated his case to them, believing that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> him what to do. This was the story he told: ...|$|E
60|$|The Ki and the Ki-Ki at once led their prisoners {{toward the}} palace and entered at its large arched double doors, where several pairs of {{servants}} met them. These servants, they found, were all dumb, so that should they {{escape from the}} palace walls <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> no tales of the High Ki.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she went}} through broad fields of yellow grain, that waved around her like a golden forest; here crickets chirped, {{grasshoppers}} leaped, and busy ants worked, but <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> her what she longed to know.|$|R
60|$|But Captain Claret must be obeyed. So off {{went the}} cutter, every man armed to the teeth, the lieutenant-commanding having secret instructions, and the midshipmen {{attending}} looking ominously wise, though, in truth, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> what was coming.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} captain; [...] "and for deep-sea {{soundings}} they do use very heavy sinkers. Sometimes they use cannon balls {{as heavy as}} a man can lift. Then they take great pains, too, {{to have a very}} light and small line. Still, with all these precautions, it is very difficult, after some miles of the line are run out, to tell when the shot reaches the bottom. In some of the deepest places in the sea, the line, when they attempt to sound, is all day running out. I knew one case where they threw the shot overboard in the morning, and the line continued to run out, though slower and slower, of course, all the time, until night. It changed its rate of running so gradually, that at last <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whether it was running or not. It seemed to float idly in the water, sinking slowly all the time; and yet <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whether it was drawn in by the drifting of the portion of the line already down, or by the weight of the shot. So <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> certainly whether they had reached bottom or not.|$|R
60|$|The {{voice that}} had spoken was Moore's own voice. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> by its tones that his soul was now warm with the conflict; they could guess that the {{fighting}} animal was roused {{in every one}} of those men there struggling together, and was for the time quite paramount above the rational human being.|$|E
60|$|Some villagers {{came running}} up, and he shouted to these, {{but what he}} said neither he nor <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell.</b> The shrieks and snortings of the horse and cows, the steady whirr of the flames, drowned all lesser sounds. Of human cries, the Rector's voice alone was heard, between the {{crashing}} blows of his axe upon the woodwork.|$|E
60|$|The lads, however, evaded all {{questions}} {{by stating that}} they belonged to the fleet, and were only on duty on the heights above Balaklava, and were in entire ignorance of {{the force of the}} army and the intentions of its general. As to the fleet, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> nothing which the Russians did not already know.|$|E
60|$|Beth {{repeated}} {{the call and}} now the answer was clearer, though still indistinguishable. It was a voice, indeed, but whose voice <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b> But now, to their astonishment, came another sound, quite clear and distinct—the wail of a baby voice.|$|R
60|$|They waited, those hungry men, three hours, till Penn reappeared with {{a smooth}} face and a blank mind. He said he {{believed}} {{that he had been}} dreaming. Then he wanted to know why they were so silent, and <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{that police}} official, {{watching}} us!" [...] cried Roger, {{as the train}} was about to depart. He was right--the man was in sight, but he quickly lost himself in a crowd, and whether {{he got on the}} train or not <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b>|$|R
60|$|Upon {{the island}} still stand noble beeches, oaks, and chestnuts--trees {{that long ago}} have covered up their bullet-scars, but <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> had they the power to speak, many a wild thrilling tale. Beautiful parks and stately mansions grace the island; and {{polished}} equipages roll over the ground that once knew naught save the soft tread of the deer and the moccasin.|$|E
60|$|Then, probably, they huddled {{together}} {{and looked into}} one another's faces for the comfort which was not there. Hitherto they had been confined on board of separate vessels, {{so that they could}} not tell whether their relatives and friends were prisoners along with them. But now, at least, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that many had been left behind or transported to other regions.|$|E
60|$|It {{contained}} {{a party of}} provincial ’Arrys and ’Arriets, out for a moonlight sail. (There was not any moon, {{but that was not}} their fault.) I never saw more attractive, lovable people in all my life. I hailed them, and asked if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> me the way to Wallingford lock; and I explained that I had been looking for it for the last two hours.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite," [...] replied Smith. [...] "That's {{about the}} size and make of the man as {{described}} to me. Of course <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> what sort of travelling gear he would appear in, but there's no mistaking the bag--old, stout leather, with flat handle-strap." ...|$|R
60|$|The various shots {{rang out}} in rapid succession. How much {{damage was done}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell,</b> {{although}} <b>they</b> saw two wolves go down and lie still. The others retreated, some limping, and the entire pack {{went back to the}} shelter of the brushwood.|$|R
6000|$|This is {{absolutely}} true, {{and was one}} of the earliest complaints made a [...] century and a half ago, when Spaniards began to criticise their one [...] great book. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> at times whether Don Quixote was [...] speaking, or Cervantes, or Cid Hamete Benengeli.|$|R
