5|$|The Lovejoy Columns, {{located in}} Portland, Oregon, United States, {{supported}} the Lovejoy Ramp, a viaduct that from 1927 to 1999 carried the western {{approach to the}} Broadway Bridge over the freight tracks {{in what is now}} the Pearl District. <b>The</b> <b>columns</b> were painted by Greek immigrant Tom Stefopoulos between 1948 and 1952. In 1999, the viaduct was demolished but <b>the</b> <b>columns</b> were spared due to the efforts of the architectural group Rigga. For the next five years, attempts to restore <b>the</b> <b>columns</b> were unsuccessful and they remained in storage beneath the Fremont Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The ice {{crystals}} in cirrus clouds have different shapes {{in addition to}} different sizes. Some shapes include solid columns, hollow columns, plates, rosettes, and conglomerations of the various other types. The shape of the {{ice crystals}} {{is determined by the}} air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and ice supersaturation. Cirrus in temperate regions typically have the shapes segregated by type: <b>the</b> <b>columns</b> and plates tend to {{be at the top of}} the cloud, whereas the rosettes and conglomerations tend to be near the base. In the northern Arctic region, cirrus tend to be composed of only <b>the</b> <b>columns,</b> plates, and conglomerations, and these crystals tend to be at least four times larger than the minimum size. In Antarctica, cirrus are usually composed of only <b>the</b> <b>columns,</b> and these columns are much longer than normal.|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} of the regiments carried a red banner displaying <b>the</b> <b>Columns</b> of Gediminas. Those that bore the Vytis, {{also known as the}} Pahonia, were armies from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while those who bore <b>the</b> <b>Columns</b> of Gediminas were from noble families of Lithuania. Until the end of the 18th century, when it was annexed by the Russian Empire, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania used the Vytis as its flag.|$|E
50|$|The rate {{at which}} a sample passes through <b>the</b> <b>column</b> is {{directly}} proportional to the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> <b>The</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>column</b> temperature, <b>the</b> faster the sample moves through <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> However, <b>the</b> faster a sample moves through <b>the</b> <b>column,</b> <b>the</b> less it interacts with the stationary phase, and the less the analytes are separated.|$|R

5|$|Disk-shaped LC {{molecules}} can orient {{themselves in}} a layer-like fashion known as the discotic nematic phase. If the disks pack into stacks, the phase is called a discotic columnar. <b>The</b> <b>columns</b> themselves may be organized into rectangular or hexagonal arrays. Chiral discotic phases, similar to the chiral nematic phase, are also known.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{two of the}} {{original}} columns were resited at Northwest 10th Avenue between Everett and Flanders Streets. The Regional Arts & Culture Council was searching for photographs showing the murals in their original location for an ongoing restoration project. In 2006, Randy Shelton reconstructed the artworks on <b>the</b> <b>columns</b> using the photographs for reference.|$|E

50|$|At the {{northwest}} of the building there is a column {{with a hole in}} the middle covered by bronze plates. This column goes by different names; <b>the</b> perspiring <b>column,</b> <b>the</b> wishing <b>column,</b> <b>the</b> sweating <b>column</b> or <b>the</b> crying <b>column.</b> <b>The</b> <b>column</b> is said to be damp when touched and have supernatural powers. The legend states that since St. Gregory the Miracle Worker appeared at <b>the</b> <b>column</b> in year 1200, <b>the</b> <b>column</b> is moist. It is believed that touching the moisture cures many illnesses.|$|R
25|$|The {{boundary}} conditions have a considerable {{effect on the}} critical load of slender <b>columns.</b> <b>The</b> {{boundary conditions}} determine the mode of bending of <b>the</b> <b>column</b> and <b>the</b> distance between inflection points on the displacement curve of <b>the</b> deflected <b>column.</b> <b>The</b> inflection points in the deflection shape of <b>the</b> <b>column</b> are <b>the</b> points at which the curvature of <b>the</b> <b>column</b> changes sign and are also the points at which the column's internal bending moments of <b>the</b> <b>column</b> are zero. <b>The</b> closer the inflection points are, the greater the resulting axial load capacity (bucking load) of <b>the</b> <b>column.</b>|$|R
5|$|The mosque's {{interior}} {{is supported by}} 45 columns, 33 of which are white marble and 12 of stone. The column rows of the central aisles are heavy and stunted. The remaining four rows are better proportioned. The capitals of <b>the</b> <b>columns</b> are of four different kinds: those in the central aisle are heavy and primitively designed, while those under the dome are of the Corinthian order, and made from Italian white marble. The capitals in the eastern aisle are of a heavy basket-shaped design and those east and west of the dome are also basket-shaped, but smaller and better proportioned. <b>The</b> <b>columns</b> and piers are connected by an architectural rave, which consists of beams of roughly squared timber enclosed in a wooden casing.|$|E
5|$|The {{spandrel}} {{plates were}} welded to <b>the</b> <b>columns</b> {{to create the}} modular pieces off-site at the fabrication shop. The modular pieces were typically 52inches (1.3m) deep, and extended for two full floors and half of two more floors. Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at mid-span of <b>the</b> <b>columns</b> and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them {{to work together in}} resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.|$|E
5|$|When the {{building}} {{was transformed into a}} mosque from a cathedral, most of the previous Crusader construction was completely replaced, but the mosque's facade with its arched entrance is a typical piece of Crusader ecclesiastical architecture, and columns within the mosque compound still retain their Italian Gothic style. Some of <b>the</b> <b>columns</b> have been identified as elements of an ancient synagogue, reused as construction material in the Crusader era and still forming part of the mosque. Internally, the wall surfaces are plastered and painted. Marble is used for the western door and the dome's oculus. The floors are covered with glazed tiles. <b>The</b> <b>columns</b> are also marble and their capitals are built in Corinthian style.|$|E
50|$|Just as in gas-liquid absorption, the {{adoption}} of reflux {{at the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>column</b> can engender multiple equilibrium stages within <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> However, if one can control {{the rate at which the}} bubble size changes with height in <b>the</b> <b>column,</b> either by coalescence or Ostwald ripening, one can engineer an internal source of reflux within <b>the</b> <b>column.</b>|$|R
25|$|In ion-exchange {{chromatography}} (IC), retention {{is based on}} the attraction between solute ions and charged sites bound to the stationary phase. Solute ions of the same charge as the charged sites on <b>the</b> <b>column</b> are excluded from binding, while solute ions of the opposite charge of the charged sites of <b>the</b> <b>column</b> are retained on <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> Solute ions that are retained on <b>the</b> <b>column</b> can be eluted from <b>the</b> <b>column</b> by changing <b>the</b> solvent conditions (e.g. increasing the ion effect of the solvent system by increasing the salt concentration of the solution, increasing <b>the</b> <b>column</b> temperature, changing <b>the</b> pH of the solvent, etc...).|$|R
30|$|The {{measured}} lateral deformation {{showed that}} inspite <b>the</b> <b>column</b> was consider as short column it exhibited lateral deformation. This lateral deformation results in decreased axial capacity of <b>the</b> <b>column</b> due to <b>the</b> resulting bending moment. In addition, the resulting lateral deformation is {{directly proportional to}} <b>the</b> <b>column</b> height even if <b>the</b> <b>column</b> still short one where this lateral deformation is neglected. In order to account for such additional moment {{as well as the}} acting primary end moments, <b>the</b> <b>column</b> is reduced to an equivalent pin-ended slender <b>column.</b> Hence, <b>the</b> additional moment can be calculated and <b>the</b> <b>column</b> cross-section can be proportionated using any available design charts as explained in the following.|$|R
5|$|Dunne's {{bartender}} came to wider {{attention with}} the wartime columns, and the Dooley pieces were soon in newspapers nationwide. Both <b>the</b> <b>columns</b> {{and the books}} collecting them gained national acclaim. Beginning around 1905, Dunne had increasing trouble finding time and inspiration for new columns, and they ended in 1915, except for a brief resurrection in the mid-1920s. Even in Dunne's own time (he died in 1936), his work was becoming obscure {{due in part to}} his use of dialect, and the unusual spellings that it used have proved a lasting barrier for potential readers.|$|E
5|$|During {{the march}} to Kediri, the Mataram–VOC army purposefully split itself and <b>the</b> <b>columns</b> took different, {{indirect}} routes to Kediri, {{as suggested by}} Amangkurat. This enabled the army to meet more factions and to win over those with wavering allegiance. The army marched through areas previously unexplored by the Dutch. The Dutch account was recorded in a journal by Hurdt's secretary Johan Jurgen Briel. Accounts of the campaign also appear in babads (Javanese chronicles).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of November 21, 1970, a dynamite-fueled bomb {{exploded}} underneath the portico, doing $170,000 in damage. Though no one was injured, windows were blown out, the Council Chamber (located above the blast) was damaged, all of <b>the</b> <b>columns</b> of the portico were damaged and replaced, and the Liberty Bell replica was a complete loss. A new bell was purchased for $8,000 and later moved to Terry Schrunk Plaza. No one was ever arrested or claimed responsibility for the bombing.|$|E

50|$|Reboilers are heat {{exchangers}} typically {{used to provide}} heat {{to the bottom of}} industrial distillation <b>columns.</b> They boil <b>the</b> liquid from the bottom of a distillation column to generate vapors which are returned to <b>the</b> <b>column</b> to drive <b>the</b> distillation separation. The heat supplied to <b>the</b> <b>column</b> by <b>the</b> reboiler at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>column</b> is removed by the condenser at the top of <b>the</b> <b>column.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 25 October 1960, {{in thick}} fog {{and a strong}} tide, two barges (named the Arkendale H and Wastdale H) which had {{overshot}} Sharpness Dock, collided with one of <b>the</b> <b>columns</b> of the bridge after being carried upstream. Two bridge spans collapsed into the river. As they fell, parts of the structure hit the barges causing the fuel oil and petroleum they were carrying to catch fire. Five {{people died in the}} incident.|$|E
5|$|On 27 June, the division's {{defensive}} {{positions at}} Minqar Qaim were encircled by the 21st Panzer Division. The battalion {{was the lead}} unit of one of <b>the</b> <b>columns,</b> numbering 900 vehicles and guns, of the division, in the subsequent breakout that night. In {{the course of this}} movement, Gray's column ran into an encampment of tanks of the 21st Panzer Division. However, the Germans failed to capitalise on the opportunity and the train of vehicles, with Gray at its head to ensure it did not come to a stop, was able to skirt the panzers with relatively few losses and reach the Alamein lines.|$|E
5|$|Some areas were, in fact, {{decorated}} with gold: the shields between the Ignudi and <b>the</b> <b>columns</b> between the Prophets and Sibyls. It seems {{very likely that}} the gilding of the shields was part of Michelangelo's original scheme, since they are painted to resemble {{a certain type of}} parade shield, a number of which still exist and are decorated in a similar style with gold.|$|E
5000|$|Now, each [...] is {{obviously}} a vector in <b>the</b> <b>column</b> space of A. So, [...] {{is a set of}} r linearly independent vectors in <b>the</b> <b>column</b> space of A and, hence, the dimension of <b>the</b> <b>column</b> space of A (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>column</b> rank of A) must be at least as big as r. This proves that row rank of A is no larger than <b>the</b> <b>column</b> rank of A. Now apply this result to the transpose of A to get the reverse inequality and conclude as in the previous proof.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>column</b> can be fed in {{different}} ways. [...] If the feed {{is from a}} source at a pressure higher than <b>the</b> distillation <b>column</b> pressure, it is simply piped into <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> Otherwise, <b>the</b> feed is pumped or compressed into <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> <b>The</b> feed may be a superheated vapor, a saturated vapor, a partially vaporized liquid-vapor mixture, a saturated liquid (i.e., liquid at its boiling point at the column's pressure), or a sub-cooled liquid. If the feed is a liquid {{at a much higher}} pressure than <b>the</b> <b>column</b> pressure and flows through a pressure let-down valve just ahead of <b>the</b> <b>column,</b> it will immediately expand and undergo a partial flash vaporization resulting in a liquid-vapor mixture as it enters <b>the</b> distillation <b>column.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In a GC analysis, a known {{volume of}} gaseous or liquid analyte is {{injected}} into the [...] "entrance" [...] (head) of <b>the</b> <b>column,</b> usually using a microsyringe (or, solid phase microextraction fibers, or a gas source switching system). As the carrier gas sweeps the analyte molecules through <b>the</b> <b>column,</b> this motion is inhibited by the adsorption of the analyte molecules either onto <b>the</b> <b>column</b> walls or onto packing materials in <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> <b>The</b> {{rate at which the}} molecules progress along <b>the</b> <b>column</b> depends on <b>the</b> strength of adsorption, which in turn depends on the type of molecule and on the stationary phase materials. Since each type of molecule has a different rate of progression, the various components of the analyte mixture are separated as they progress along <b>the</b> <b>column</b> and reach <b>the</b> end of <b>the</b> <b>column</b> at different times (retention time). A detector is used to monitor the outlet stream from the column; thus, the time at which each component reaches the outlet and the amount of that component can be determined. Generally, substances are identified (qualitatively) by the order in which they emerge (elute) from <b>the</b> <b>column</b> and by <b>the</b> retention time of the analyte in <b>the</b> <b>column.</b>|$|R
5|$|Soult divided {{his army}} into two contingents and {{advanced}} into Extremadura via {{the two main}} passes leading from Andalusia into the Guadiana valley, {{with the intention of}} rejoining at Almendralejo. One of <b>the</b> <b>columns,</b> commanded by Gen. Marie Victor Latour-Maubourg, met little resistance on its march; on 3 January 1811 the column was confronted by 2,500 Spanish and Portuguese cavalry near Usagre, but that force was only a screen covering the retreat beyond the Guadiana of a Spanish infantry division commanded by Gen. Mendizabal. Latour-Maubourg was therefore able to take position near Almendralejo and await the arrival of the second French column.|$|E
5|$|St Paul's, {{commonly}} known as the Actors' Church, was built in 1633, at a cost of £4,000, though was not consecrated until 1638. In 1645 Covent Garden was made a separate parish and the church was dedicated to St Paul. How much of Jones's original building is left is unclear, as the church was damaged by fire in 1795 during restoration work by Thomas Hardwick; <b>the</b> <b>columns</b> are thought to be original but the rest is mostly Georgian or Victorian reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|Steadily {{rising sea}} levels then further {{isolated}} this little island, which is entirely of volcanic origin. It {{consists of a}} basement of tuff, underneath colonnades of a black fine-grained Tertiary basalt, overlying which is a third layer of basaltic lava without a crystalline structure. By contrast, slow cooling of the second layer of basalt resulted in an extraordinary pattern of predominantly hexagonal columns which form the faces and walls of the principal caves. The lava contracted towards each {{of a series of}} equally spaced centres as it cooled and solidified into prismatic columns, a process known as columnar jointing. <b>The</b> <b>columns</b> typically have three to eight sides, six being most common. <b>The</b> <b>columns</b> are also divided horizontally by cross joints. These columnar jointed sections represent the tops and bottoms of individual lava flows. Between these sections lie regions of much more chaotic jointing, known as the entablature. The origin of the entablature is unknown, but could be due to flooding of the lava flow, causing much more rapid cooling, or the interaction of stress fields from the two regions of columnar jointing as they approach one another.|$|E
