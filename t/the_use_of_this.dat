5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 17th century, the {{maritime}} use of the white flag with the Royal coat of arms of Portugal was increasingly restricted to the war ships. An ordinance of 1692 expressly banned <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> flag by the Portuguese merchant ships, restricting its use to ships with 20 or more cannons and with a complement of 40 or more men. The Portuguese merchant ships flew instead green and white striped flags, which were the national colours of Portugal at that time. The colours green and white were also used in other Portuguese flags, like the naval commissioning pennants.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these preventable issues, GWA studies have attracted more fundamental criticism, mainly because of their assumption that common genetic variation plays {{a large role in}} explaining the heritable variation of common disease. This aspect of GWA studies has attracted the criticism that, although it could not have been known prospectively, GWA studies were ultimately not worth the expenditure. Alternative strategies suggested involve linkage analysis. More recently, the rapidly decreasing price of complete genome sequencing have also provided a realistic alternative to genotyping array-based GWA studies. It can be discussed if <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new technique is still referred to as a GWA study, but high-throughput sequencing does have potential to side-step some of the shortcomings of non-sequencing GWA.|$|E

Eventually, US 80 did {{become the most}} used road into Southern California from the east, but by 1947, the Highway 80 Associated was formed to increase the traffic on the road, since the war and advertising by other cities had caused it to fall again. Four years later, US 80 {{was reported to be}} the most used transcontinental highway, and there was a 40 percent increase in the out-of-state cars that traveled through the state inspection station at Yuma during {{the first three months of}} that year. But in 1954, there were reports that traffic had decreased, because the road to Phoenix, Arizona from Lordsburg, New Mexico had improved.|$|E

5|$|The Red Ensign of Singapore {{is a civil}} ensign used by privately owned, non-military {{ships that}} are {{registered}} in Singapore.

5|$|The {{court also}} created the plenary power doctrine, holding {{that the federal}} court did not have {{jurisdiction}} because Congress had not passed a law giving jurisdiction to the federal courts or taking away {{the rights of the}} tribe. Crow Dog was the last in a line of sovereignty cases that began with Cherokee Nation; the next major case, United States v. Kagama, (1886), upheld the plenary power of Congress to enact the Major Crimes Act. The plenary power doctrine allowed Congress to enact any law that it wanted to pass, over the opposition of the tribe or tribes affected. Congress subsequently used this power to breach the Medicine Lodge Treaty with the Kiowa by reducing the size of the Kiowa reservation without their consent. <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> power led to complaints of being subject to a lawmaking body without representation, especially prior to being granted U.S. citizenship in 1924.|$|E

5|$|The novelists of the {{dictator}} novel genre combined narrative strategies of both modern and postmodern writing. Postmodern techniques, constructed {{largely in the}} late 1960s and 1970s, included use of interior monologues, radically stream-of-consciousness narrative, fragmentation, varying narrative points of view, neologisms, innovative narrative strategies, and frequent lack of causality. Alejo Carpentier, a Boom writer and contributor to {{the dictator}} novel genre pioneered {{what came to be}} known as magical realism, although <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> technique is not necessarily a prerequisite of the dictator novel, as there are many that do not utilize magical realism.|$|E
5|$|A {{delegation}} of landowners presented the ORD Real Estate Branch with a petition protesting {{the acquisition of}} their property on 23 November 1942, and that night over 200 landowners held a meeting at which they agreed to hire lawyers and appraisers to challenge the Federal government. Local newspapers and politicians were sympathetic to their cause. By the end of May 1943, agreements were reached covering 416 tracts totaling , but some landowners rejected the government's offers. The ORD Real Estate Branch invoked a procedure under Tennessee law that allowed for a jury of five citizens appointed by the Federal District Court to review the compensation offered. They handled five cases in which they proposed higher values {{than those of the}} ORD appraisers, but the landowners rejected them as well, so the Army discontinued <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> method. In response to rising public criticism, O'Brien commissioned a review by the Department of Agriculture.

5|$|The {{artifact}} shows {{a number}} of idiosyncrasies that raise questions concerning its authenticity. The numbering systems used in the codex conflict. The Maya bar-and-dot system is used to mark units, but the central Mexican dot system is used to mark multiples of twenty (for example by using 11 dots instead of 2 bars and a dot, as {{would be the case}} in the bar-and-dot system where a bar indicates 5 and a dot indicates 1). Some bar-and-dot numbers are placed within a cartouche decorated with a knot at the top. The only other instance of such a cartouche being used with numbers is in the Dresden Codex, where the cartouche has a very specific function, indicating a negative date count from the zero year of the great cycle of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar (roughly equivalent to the function of BC in the Gregorian calendar). In the Grolier Codex, where the numbers mark intervals between stations of Venus, <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> cartouche appears meaningless, although it is suggested that it means that the codex may be read both from the front and from the back.|$|E
