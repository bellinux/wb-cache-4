5|$|The {{entrance}} is resolved {{in a manner}} simultaneously elegant and eccentric, in an almost exuberant and free syntax. The canonical orders are absent, and the collection is conceived as an imaginative blend of quasi-archaeological redeployment. For this reason, critics do not attribute the project to Cairano, which remains a formidable invention that is highly representative of antiquarian culture of the time. Surely Cairano's, however, is <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>that</b> produced the sculptures along with anthropomorphic figures, dolphins and fantastic creatures, the artist already experimented with these in the Loggia; and once again, the artist inserted small Caesars, both on the portal {{as well as the}} overpass, which achieve the poetic zenith of some of his portraiture of old.|$|E

25|$|Standard proverbs are {{essentially}} defined phrases, well-known to many people, as e. g. Don't bite <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>that</b> feeds you. When this sequence slightly changed ("Don't bite <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>that</b> looks dirty") {{it becomes an}} anti-proverb. The relationship between anti-proverbs and proverbs, and a study of how much a proverb can be changed before the resulting anti-proverb is no longer seen as proverbial, are still open topics for research.|$|E

25|$|In quatrain two, {{the speaker}} implores {{the young man}} to forget <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>that</b> wrote the sonnet if the mere thought of the speaker would cause him to mourn. This is {{particularly}} ironic considering that there are lines in other sonnets (e.g., Sonnet 18, Sonnet 55, Sonnet 65 and Sonnet 81) that speak of immortality through poetic verse, thus negating the possibility that one can be forgotten.|$|E

25|$|Special Enquiry Detail: <b>The</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>that</b> Feeds, {{written and}} {{designed}} by Ince, {{is one of}} his casual/hidden object games. The critically acclaimed detective adventure game debuted on the Mac App Store on January 2012. It was followed by a sequel, Special Enquiry Detail: Engaged to Kill (G5 Entertainment, March 2012). So Blonde also got a follow-up, Captain Morgane and the Golden Turtle (Wizarbox, 2012), that is set back in pirate times. Ince gave some video interviews to introduce the game.|$|E

25|$|In practice, no gag is {{effective}} enough to silence someone completely without inhibiting breathing. Most gags that prevent the subject from making intelligible speech still permit loud, inarticulate noises {{to call for}} help. Thus, a pattern of noises, such as three grunts in rapid succession, is sometimes used as a safeword by BDSM players. It is also common to use an additional non-verbal safety mechanism, such as a solid object held in <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>that</b> can be released by the gagged person to signal distress.|$|E
25|$|Popular culture figures {{need not}} be admirable in order to {{influence}} naming trends. For example, Peyton came into the top 1000 as a female given name for babies in the United States {{for the first time}} in 1992 (at #583), immediately after it was featured as the name of an evil nanny in the film <b>The</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>That</b> Rocks the Cradle. On the other hand, historical events can influence child-naming. For example, the given name Adolf has fallen out of use since the end of World War II in 1945.|$|E
25|$|Biting {{his beard}} and {{ignoring}} his wounds, Starkad charged the Danish army, killing man after man, until {{he met the}} shieldmaiden Ursina who carried the banner of king Harald Wartooth.

Starkad continued killing warrior after warrior, until he finally was so severely wounded that he had a large gash on his neck and a large gash on his chest that made his two lungs hang out. On his right hand, he had lost a finger.|$|E

25|$|The longe whip {{takes the}} place of the rider's legs, asking the horse to move forward or out. It is held with the tip low, {{pointing}} towards the horse's hocks, with the lash dragging on the ground. The whip is held in <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>that</b> the horse is not going (so if the horse were going to the right, the whip would be held in the lunger's left hand). The horse is to accept the whip as an aid, and not be fearful. When the handler goes toward the horse to adjust equipment, the lash is caught up and the whip turned backward, under the arm, so that it does not interfere with the horse.|$|E
25|$|Other sources {{claim that}} an angry mob {{tried to kill}} Aeschylus on the spot, but he fled the scene. Heracleides of Pontus asserts that the {{audience}} tried to stone Aeschylus. He then took refuge at the altar in the orchestra of the Theater of Dionysus. At his trial, he pleaded ignorance. He was acquitted, with the jury sympathetic to the military service of Aeschylus and his brothers during the Persian Wars. According to the 2nd-century AD author Aelian, Aeschylus's younger brother Ameinias helped to acquit Aeschylus by showing the jury the stump of <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>that</b> he lost at Salamis, where he was voted bravest warrior. The {{truth is that the}} award for bravery at Salamis went not to Aeschylus' brother but to Ameinias of Pallene.|$|E
25|$|The Smiths then {{agreed to}} sign a record {{contract}} with Rough Trade, with Travis travelling up to Manchester to meet the band at their Crazy Face rehearsal space; there they signed the contract. Only Morrissey and Marr signed it {{on behalf of the}} band, and there was no discussion at the time regarding how the band's earnings would be divided up, something that would lead to the eventual argument over royalties which resulted in the 1996 High Court case. To produce the band's first album, Travis brought in Troy Tate of The Teardrop Explodes, and under Tate's supervision the band recorded their first album, provisionally titled <b>The</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>That</b> Rocks the Cradle, at the Elephant Studios in Wapping, East London. Rough Trade were unhappy with the album that the band produced and Troy's production of it, ordering the band to redo it with a new producer, John Porter.|$|E

25|$|The proud {{spirit of}} the {{original}} owners of these vast prairies inherited through centuries of fierce and bloody wars for their possession, lingered last in the bosom of Sitting Bull. With his fall the nobility of the Redskin is extinguished, and what few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>that</b> smites them. The Whites, by law of conquest, by justice of civilization, are masters of the American continent, and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total annihilation {{of the few remaining}} Indians. Why not annihilation? Their glory has fled, their spirit broken, their manhood effaced; better that they die than live the miserable wretches that they are. History would forget these latter despicable beings, and speak, in latter ages of the glory of these grand Kings of forest and plain that Cooper loved to heroize.|$|E
25|$|In the {{criminal}} code, the ruling principle was the lex talionis. Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, limb for limb was {{the penalty for}} assault upon an amelu. A sort of symbolic retaliation was the punishment for the offender, seen in cutting off <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>that</b> struck a father or stole a trust; in cutting off the breast of a wet nurse who switched the child entrusted to her for another; {{in the loss of}} the tongue that denied father or mother (in Elamite contracts, the same penalty was inflicted for perjury); in the loss of the eye that pried into forbidden secrets. The loss of the surgeon's hand that caused loss of life or limb, or the brander's hand that obliterated a slave's identification mark, are very similar. The slave who struck a freeman or denied his master lost an ear, the organ of hearing and symbol of obedience. A person who brought another into danger of death by false accusation was punished by death. A perjurer was punished by the same penalty the perjurer sought to bring upon another.|$|E

Big Show lost to his opponent, Shawn Michaels, by disqualification after Triple H hit Michaels with a chair, intentionally costing Big Show the match and the title shot. In retaliation, Wight cost Triple H his qualifying match with Kane later that evening. On the December 26 episode of Raw, during the contract-signing for the match between Big Show and Triple H at New Year's Revolution, Triple H struck Big Show in <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>that</b> Big Show apparently favors when using the chokeslam with his sledgehammer. The following week, Big Show attacked Triple H while wearing a cast on his hand, using the padding provided by the cast to punch a hole in a chair held by Triple H, destroying a monitor from the broadcast table that Triple H intended to throw at him, and chasing Triple H away from the ring. At New Year's Revolution, Triple H defeated Wight after striking him in the head with his sledgehammer.|$|E
