5|$|The {{big game}} starts with six players, {{including}} Howard and the Kid, with Shooter playing as he deals and Lady Fingers relieving him whenever Shooter needs a break. In {{the first big}} confrontation between the Kid and Howard, <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>is</b> short $2,000 and Slade steps in to stake him. Several hours later, Howard busts a player called Pig, perhaps with a bluff, and the remaining players take a break. Following the break, Lady Fingers, who has been delighting in needling Howard all evening, takes over as dealer and continues to needle him.|$|E
500|$|Malathi Rangarajan, in her {{review of}} Deiva Thirumagal (2011) said, [...] "Probably because {{the scene of}} action is Ooty, the main {{character}} is mentally challenged, and the story-telling sequence with Vikram and <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> <b>is</b> familiar, at times [...] reminds you of Balu Mahendra's inimitable Moondraam Pirai." [...] Baradwaj Rangan compares a scene in Barfi! (2012), where Barfi (Ranbir Kapoor) goes after Shruti (Ileana D'Cruz) and stumbles, to that of Moondram Pirais climax scene. Balu Mahendra's defunct blog is also titled Moondram Pirai..., named after the film.|$|E

40|$|In {{a family}} context with {{endogenous}} timing, multiple public goods and alternative parental instruments, {{we show that}} the optimal timing for the sequential-action game played by rotten kids and a parent depends crucially on whether <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> homogeneous or heterogeneous. For homogeneous <b>kids,</b> <b>the</b> rotten <b>kid</b> theorem holds irrespective of the parental policy instrument, implying that it is optimal to let <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> to <b>be</b> action leaders. If <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> heterogeneous, however, parental leadership yields a first best outcome and, hence, it <b>is</b> optimal whenever <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> economically dependent and agree on the tradeoff between public goods...|$|R
500|$|By early April, most NBA draft analysts {{thought he}} would be {{selected}} in the second round, but Larry Butler, his former AAU coach with the Illinois Warriors, thought he might go late in the first round.

500|$|Caragiale {{showed little}} {{surprise}} at the news. In an interview with poet Alexandru Antemireanu, he explained his conflict with Caion in paternalistic terms: [...] "They did well not to sentence <b>the</b> <b>kid.</b> <b>Is</b> he the guilty party? No! Caion is merely a victim. Say I were a juror: why would I be setting an example by punishing this unreasonable and irresponsible kid, {{for those who are}} more mature and better placed, and who employ the same means as he did?" [...] The general public was by then firmly on Caragiale's side, and Macedonski's reputation suffered greatly as a result, increasing his isolation on the literary scene.|$|E
500|$|Several of Chaplin's films {{incorporate}} autobiographical elements, and {{the psychologist}} Sigmund Freud believed that Chaplin [...] "always plays only {{himself as he}} was in his dismal youth". <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>is</b> thought to reflect Chaplin's childhood trauma of being sent into an orphanage, the main characters in Limelight (1952) contain elements from the lives of his parents, and A King in New York references Chaplin's experiences of being shunned by the United States. Many of his sets, especially in street scenes, bear a strong similarity to Kennington, where he grew up. Stephen M. Weissman has argued that Chaplin's problematic relationship with his mentally ill mother was often reflected in his female characters and the Tramp's desire to save them.|$|E

500|$|Losing a {{child is}} thought to have {{influenced}} Chaplin's work, as he planned a film which turned the Tramp into the caretaker of a young boy. For this new venture, Chaplin also wished to do more than comedy and, according to Louvish, [...] "make his mark on a changed world." [...] Filming on The Kid began in August 1919, with four-year-old Jackie Coogan his co-star. It occurred to Chaplin that it was turning into a large project, so to placate First National, he halted production and quickly filmed A Day's Pleasure. The Kid was in production for nine months until May 1920 and, at 68 minutes, it was Chaplin's longest picture to date. Dealing with issues of poverty and parent–child separation, <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>is</b> thought to have been influenced by Chaplin's own childhood {{and was one of the}} earliest films to combine comedy and drama. It was released in January 1921 with instant success, and, by 1924, had been screened in over 50 countries.|$|E

He {{added that}} the track was a [...] "sad, almost mournful song, but a thumping resolve underlies [...] feelings". Blender stated that the song was [...] "one of the most sonically eccentric, psychologically fraught, downright bizarre things ever to land on Top 40 radio". They added that it was [...] "frighteningly stark, with a pulsing, cat-on-the-prowl bass figure, whip-crack downbeat and eerie multi-tracked vocals ricocheting in the vast spaces between keyboards and strings". Overall, the magazine described the track as [...] "a five-minute-long nervous breakdown, set to a beat". Stylus said of the song, [...] "It's {{one of the best}} representations of film noir in pop music, ending with no resolution except a single mother and selfish, careless scumball." [...] In a review of Thriller 25, AllMusic observed that [...] "Billie Jean" [...] was [...] "startling" [...] in its [...] "futuristic funk". The track also won praise from Jackson biographers. Nelson George stated that Jerry Hey's string arrangement added danger to [...] "Billie Jean", while J. Randy Taraborrelli added that it was [...] "dark and sparse" [...] by Quincy Jones' production standards.|$|E

2500|$|There was a brawl on pit road {{involving}} Jeff Gordon, Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick. Keselowski and Harvick {{were parked}} in the post-race impound area where the cars that finished second through sixth are held for post-race inspection. Gordon pulled his car and parked it right beside Brad's car. He got out and had a level-headed conversation with {{the driver of the}} No. 2 Ford that seemed to make him more angry. As Keselowski was putting on his Miller Lite cap, Kevin proceeded to shove him towards Gordon and all hell broke loose. Multiple pit crews from the three racing stables as well as Paul Menard's crew were involved (Keselowski's spot in the impound area was in the pit stall of the No. 27 car). ESPN's Jamie Little was {{caught in the middle of}} it. “We’re racing for the win,” said Keselowski of the on track contact. “ to wreck him, just racing hard. He left a hole and you know, everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you’re supposed to go for it. It closed back up and we made contact. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s day. I want to win the race and that was our opportunity. Just didn’t come together.” “I spun the tires a little bit but I got a pretty decent start and we went down into one and I just wanted to get to the outside of the 48 [...] and out of nowhere, I got slammed by the 2 and it cut my left rear tire. He's just a dipshit," [...] Gordon said in a nationally televised interview on ESPN. [...] "I don't know how he's ever won a championship. I'm just sick and tired of him. ... That was a huge race for us. I'm proud of Jimmie Johnson for winning that race. I didn't want that you-know-what (Keselowski) to win that race. ... (Keselowski) gets himself in this position himself and as far as I'm concerned he's got to pay the consequences. … It's total crap. <b>The</b> <b>kid</b> <b>is</b> just doing stuff way over his head." [...] “I'm not trying to sit here and sugarcoat it and try to be The Intimidator,’’ Keselowski said. “That's not what I'm trying to say. My expectation is if there's a gap, they'll go for it. If there's a gap, I'll go for it. If it closes up, there's contact, then that's racing. And that's what happened today. Will those guys race me hard or harder than others? Absolutely, I'm certain they will. But that's just part of it. I can't fault them for that. I just feel like I have to go for the gap if it's there, and I have to race the way I race or I won't even be in NASCAR. I'd rather have enemies in NASCAR than have friends and be sitting at home.’’ “If you’re going to drive like that, you better be willing to fight,’’ Harvick said he told Keselowski. “He was going to stand behind his guys. Jeff Gordon deserved to at least have a face-to-face conversation with him. I wasn’t standing up for anybody. (Keselowski) just ran over (Gordon). He was standing back behind all his guys, not wanting to defend what he did. I said, ‘You’re the problem, get in your own fight.’ ‘’ Robin Pemberton, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said that series officials will review what took place to determine what, if any, penalties will be issued. “Holding onto each other and grabbing… that's one thing. When punches are landed, it's a different scenario," [...] Pemberton said.|$|E
