5|$|The {{events that}} would cost Cumanus his office began {{with the murder of}} one or more Galilean pilgrims who had been {{travelling}} through Samaria on their way to Jerusalem. A Galilean embassy asked Cumanus to investigate but received little attention; Josephus alleges that he had been bribed by the Samaritans to turn a blind eye. The result was that a crowd of Jews decided to take <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>into</b> their own hands. Under the leadership of two Zealots, Eleazar and Alexander, they invaded Samaria and began a massacre. Cumanus led most of his troops against the militants, killing many and taking others prisoner, and the Jewish leaders from Jerusalem were subsequently able to calm most of the others, but a state of guerrilla warfare persisted.|$|E

In the West, cattle barons took <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>into</b> {{their own hands}} by hanging those whom they perceived as cattle and horse thieves. This was also related to a political and social struggle between these classes.|$|E
25|$|The British {{minister}} of colonies, Lord Glenelg, repudiated d'Urban's actions and accused the Boer retaliation against cattle raiders as being what instigating the conflict.

25|$|This {{doctrine}} {{was further}} developed by English courts, {{and made an}} immediate impact on the law. Prior to Rylands, English courts had not based their decisions in similar cases on strict liability, and had focused on the intention behind the actions rather than {{the nature of the}} actions themselves. In contrast, Rylands imposed strict liability on those found detrimental in such a fashion without having to prove a duty of care or negligence, which brought <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>into</b> line with that relating to public reservoirs and marked a significant doctrinal shift. Academics have criticised it, however, both for the economic damage such a doctrine could cause and for its limited applicability.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} night, 24 March, a {{crowd of}} between 7–8,000 men assembled in North Quay, and into Queen and William Street, where speakers began talking about taking <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>into</b> their own hands. As the anger amongst the crowd grew, a large group broke away from it and carrying a large Australian flag proceeded to cross Victoria Bridge singing patriotic songs. Assembling at Merivale Street they began to move towards the hall. Finding their way blocked by a force of between 40–60 police mounted on horseback and armed with rifles and bayonets, {{under the command of}} the police commissioner, Frederic Urquhart, a clash broke out in which over 100 men received bayonet wounds. The fighting lasted for two hours. In the end between 14 and 19 police officers were injured and three police horses were shot, one of which later died, while 19 of the injured ex-servicemen needed to be evacuated by ambulance.|$|E
25|$|Prohibition of Third-party standing: A {{party may}} only assert {{his or her}} own rights and cannot raise the claims of a third party who is not before the court; {{exceptions}} exist where the third party has interchangeable economic interests with the injured party, or a person unprotected by a particular law sues to challenge the oversweeping of <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>into</b> the rights of others. For example, a party suing over a law prohibiting certain types of visual material, may sue because the 1st Amendment rights of theirs, and others engaged in similar displays, might be damaged.Additionally, third parties who do not have standing may be able to sue under the next friend doctrine if the third party is an infant, mentally handicapped, or not a party to a contract. One example of a statutory exception to the prohibition of third party standing exists in the qui tam provision of the Civil False Claims Act.|$|E
25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: {{but there are times}} when the laws of nature assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, and this was a case in point. You must remember that these men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they come to me and said, 'Give us money and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and so they took <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>into</b> their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of the rediscovery of the Roman law in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, the common law had already {{developed}} far enough to prevent a Roman law reception as it occurred on the continent. However, the first common law scholars, most notably Glanvill and Bracton, as well as the early royal common law judges, had been well accustomed with Roman law. Often, they were clerics trained in the Roman canon law. One of the first and throughout its history {{one of the most significant}} treatises of the common law, Bracton's De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae (On the Laws and Customs of England), was heavily influenced by the division of the law in Justinian's Institutes. The impact of Roman law had decreased sharply after the age of Bracton, but the Roman divisions of actions into in rem (typically, actions against a thing or property for the purpose of gaining title to that property; must be filed in a court where the property is located) and in personam (typically, actions directed against a person; these can affect a person's rights and, since a person often owns things, his property too) used by Bracton had a lasting effect and laid the groundwork for a return of Roman law structural concepts in the 18th and 19th centuries. Signs of this can be found in Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, and Roman law ideas regained importance with the revival of academic law schools in the 19th century. As a result, today, the main systematic divisions of <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>into</b> property, contract, and tort (and to some extent unjust enrichment) can be found in the civil law as well as in the common law.|$|E

But whatever Tip went into, {{he came out of}} tired, announcing that he had cut it. Wherever he went, this foredoomed Tip appeared to take the prison walls with him, and to set them up in such trade or calling; and to prowl about within their narrow limits in the old slip-shod, purposeless, down-at-heel way; until the real immovable Marshalsea walls asserted their fascination over him, and brought him back.|$|R

500|$|The general {{population}} was less sympathetic towards Noreen. Several signs were erected in Sheikhupura and other rural areas declaring {{support for the}} blasphemy laws, including one that called for Noreen to be beheaded. Mohammad Saleem, {{a member of the}} Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan Party, organized a demonstration in Rawalpindi and led a small crowd chanting, [...] "Hang her, hang her." [...] In December 2010, a month after Noreen's conviction, a Muslim cleric announced a 500,000 Pakistani rupee award (the equivalent of $10,000) to anyone who would kill her. One survey reported that around 10 million Pakistanis had said that {{they would be willing to}} personally kill her out of either religious conviction or for the reward. The village mosque in Ittan Wali was reportedly indifferent towards Noreen's plight; its imam, Qari Mohammed Salim, stated that he had wept for joy on learning that she had been sentenced to death and threatened that some people would [...] "take <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>into</b> their own hands" [...] should she be pardoned or released. However, journalist Julie McCarthy suggested that the country's [...] "more peaceful majority views" [...] had been overshadowed by the more vocal fundamentalists.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} days of the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine the kibbutz was {{subjected}} to almost daily attacks, usually shootings and burning of forests. The Arabs in the region were under the command of Ahmad Attiyah Awad and after his death in March 1938, the commend was transferred to Yusuf Abu Durra. British High Commissioner Arthur Grenfell Wauchope visited the kibbutz and appointed 15 members as guards and gave them firearms but in August 1936 the situation worsened. The British government sent 60 soldiers to guard the kibbutz and in October the attacks on the kibbutz ended. During the attacks, tens of thousands of trees were burnt. Israeli poet and later member of the Knesset, Uri Zvi Greenberg, criticized the residents of Mishmar HaEmek for not taking <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>into</b> their hands after the attacks on their fields and in a poem he wrote on the events he changed the name of the kibbutz from [...] "Mishmar HaEmek" [...] (Guard of the Valley) to [...] "Hefker HaEmek" [...] (Abandonment of the Valley). On 2 February 1938 a member of the kibbutz named Abraham Goldschleger who was a guide for Ein HaShofet was ambushed and murdered by residents of Al-Kafrayn. Two residents of Ein HaShofet who accompanied him were also killed in the attack. One of the shooters was caught and executed. The Palmach (an elite force of the Jewish Haganah underground organization) used the trees in the nearby forest as cover for their main training camp and its fighters worked in the kibbutz.|$|E

500|$|The Analysis {{was based}} on lectures he gave to students, and was most likely not {{intended}} to be published; it is considered the first history of English law ever written. Divided into 13 chapters, the book dealt with the history of English law and some suggestions for reform. William Blackstone, when writing his Commentaries on the Laws of England, noted in his preface that [...] "of all the earlier schemes for digesting the Laws of England the most natural and scientific, as well as the most comprehensive, appeared to be that of Sir Matthew Hale in his posthumous Analysis of the Law". Hale proposed the creation of county courts, and also drew a strong distinction between written laws, such as statutes, and customary, unwritten laws. He also argued that the common law was subject to Parliament, far before the confirmation of Parliamentary supremacy, and that the law should protect the rights and civil liberties of the King's subjects. He also argued for the confirmation of trial by jury, which he described as [...] "the best mode of trial in the world", while the 13th chapter divided <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>into</b> the laws of persons and of property, and dealt with the rights, wrongs and remedies recognised by the law at the time. William Holdsworth, himself considered one of the greatest common law historians, described it as [...] "the ablest introductory sketch of a history of English law that appeared till the publication of Pollock and Maitland's volumes in 1895".|$|E
