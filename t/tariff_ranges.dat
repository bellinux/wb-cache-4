Although today the PV systems price is decreasing, which gives it a competitive edge; we see the technology still being dependent on policy instruments for its dissemination.   The aim {{of this study is to}} research on whether or not a solar PV system is economically viable under certain circumstances. The study analyzes this by performing a cost beneficial analysis for the lifetime of the solar PV system making use of a discounted savings model. The systems being considered in this study are from California and Germany as these regions are leading in solar PV dissemination in their respective regions. The policies that are aiding the deployment of solar PV technologies are varied and thus this study compares benefits from different policy instrument for a residential customer investing in a solar PV system.   The research objectives in this study are pursued making use of major concepts such as Grid Parity, Levelized Cost of Electricity and financial methods such as discounting.  Further, to understand how the different independent variables such as retail electricity prices, PV system pricing, WACC, self-consumption rate and storage availability are having an impact and how the results change with variation in these variables, a sensitivity analysis is conducted.   The results obtained in this study show that a solar PV system installed in California and Germany both make net benefits over their lifetime. When compared, the Californian solar PV system under the Net Energy Metering policy is making more net economic benefits in the range of $ 40, 351 in Eureka and $ 53, 510 in San Francisco; when compared to the German solar PV systems under the Feed in <b>Tariff</b> <b>ranging</b> $ 4, 465 in Berlin and $ 11, 769 in Munich.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} and contrast the welfare effects of free trade agreements (FTAs) and customs unions (CUs) on member and non-member countries when tariffs of both members and non-members are endogenously determined. It also aims to provide sufficient conditions under which both types of preferential trade agreement (PTA) are likely to lower tariffs on non-members relative to that under most favored nation (MFN). Design/methodology/approach – The paper employs a three country Cournot oligopoly model of trade with segmented markets. Findings – It is shown that under symmetry CU members enjoy higher welfare relative to that under an FTA or MFN. Furthermore, the non-member country gains from the formation of a PTA so long as the PTA's external tariff falls below a certain threshold. However, for FTA members to necessarily gain, their external tariff needs to be greater than this threshold but smaller than twice their MFN tariffs. Outside this <b>tariff</b> <b>range,</b> welfare effects of FTAs are ambiguous in the absence of further assumptions. The paper also isolates sufficient conditions under which a PTA member is less likely to impose a positive tariff on the non-member relative to that under MFN. Originality/value – Unlike existing literature, we do no assume demand linearity to obtain our main welfare results and use this assumption only for illustrative purposes. Another contribution of the paper is to provide sufficient conditions under which a PTA member is less likely to impose a positive tariff on the non-member relative to that under MFN.

Participants were 473 patients of 65 years and older, acutely hospitalised for more than 48 hours. Demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and data on 18 geriatric conditions were collected at baseline. At baseline and 12 months post-admission, the EuroQol- 5 D was administered.

40|$|This article {{shows the}} {{equivalence}} between tariffs {{on international trade}} and income taxation. Traditionally, income taxes {{have been seen as}} lowering society's output through the household's labor-leisure trade-off. Income taxes also reduce the degree to which individuals specialize in market activity, which is similar to the way countries respond to tariffs in international trade. Income taxes discourage individuals from specializing in activities that reflect their comparative advantage. In so doing, income taxes may have their most distorting effects, not by encouraging individuals to work less but by causing them to spend more time working at endeavors for which their talent is limited. Using a general model of interpersonal exchange, the authors demonstrate parallels between income taxes and <b>tariffs.</b> Over a <b>range</b> of income taxes, raising taxes can benefit large groups of similarly skilled individuals and hurt small groups. As in tariff theory, the costs of income taxes are small only if they succeed in raising revenue. Thus, it is very costly for an economy to be on the downward portion of its tax revenue (Laffer) curve. The more heterogeneous the society, the higher the income tax rate that will maximize tax revenues. By overlooking the effects of heterogeneity in the workforce and the potential for workers to flee to home production, policymakers may under- or overestimate the effects of income taxes on various sectors of the economy and tax with unintended consequences.

40|$|To {{achieve a}} sizable and {{self-sustaining}} market for grid-connected, customer-sited photovoltaic (PV) systems, solar will likely {{need to be}} competitive with retail electricity rates. In this report, we {{examine the impact of}} retail rate design on the economic value of commercial PV systems in California. Using 15 -minute interval building load and PV production data from 24 actual commercial PV installations, we compare the value of the bill savings across 20 commercial customer retail rates currently offered in the state. We find that the specifics of the rate structure, combined with the characteristics of the customer's underlying load {{and the size of the}} PV system, can have a substantial impact on the customer-economics of commercial PV systems. Key conclusions for policymakers that emerge from our analysis are as follows: {sm_bullet} Rate design is fundamental to the economics of commercial PV. The rate-reduction value of PV for our sample of commercial customers, considering all available retail <b>tariffs,</b> <b>ranges</b> from $ 0. 05 /kWh to $ 0. 24 /kWh, reflecting differences in rate structures, the revenue requirements of the various utilities, the size of the PV system relative to building load, and customer load shapes. For the average customer in our sample, differences in rate structure, alone, alter the value of PV by 25 % to 75 %, depending on the size of the PV system relative to building load. {sm_bullet} TOU-based energy-focused rates can provide substantial value to many PV customers. Retail rates that wrap all or most utility cost recovery needs into time-of-use (TOU) -based volumetric energy rates, and which exclude or limit demand-based charges, provide the most value to PV systems across a wide variety of circumstances. Expanding the availability of such rates will increase the value of many commercial PV systems. {sm_bullet} Offering commercial customers a variety of rate options would be of value to PV. Despite the advantages of energy-focused rates for PV, requiring the use of these tariffs would disadvantage some commercial PV installations. In particular, for PV systems that serve less than 25 - 50 % of annual customer load, the characteristics of the customer's underlying load profile often determine the most favorable rate structure, and energy-focused rate structures may not be ideal for many commercial-customer load shapes. Regulators that wish to establish rates that are beneficial to a range of PV applications should therefore consider allowing customers to choose from among a number of different rate structures. {sm_bullet} Eliminating net metering can significantly degrade the economics of PV systems that serve a large percentage of building load. Under the assumptions stipulated in this report, we find that an elimination of net metering could, in some circumstances, result in more than a 25 % loss in the rate-reduction value of commercial PV. As long as annual solar output is less than roughly 25 % of customer load and excess PV production can be sold to the local utility at a rate above $ 0. 05 /kWh, however, elimination of net metering is found to rarely result in a financial loss of greater than 5 % of the rate-reduction value of PV. More detailed conclusions on the rate-reduction value of commercial PV include: {sm_bullet} Commercial PV systems can sometimes greatly reduce demand charges. Though energy-focused retail rates often offer the greatest rate reduction value, commercial PV installations can generate significant reductions in demand charges, in some cases constituting 10 - 50 % of the total rate savings derived from PV installations. These savings, however, depend highly on the size of the PV system relative to building load, on the customer's load shape, and on the design of the demand charge itself. {sm_bullet} The value of demand charge reductions declines with PV system size. At high levels of PV penetration, the value of PV-induced demand charge savings on a $/kWh basis can drop substantially. As a result, the rate-reduction value of PV can decline by up to one-half when a PV system meets 75 % rather than 2 % of total building load. Thus, for rates with significant demand charges, the drop in demand charge savings dramatically reduces the overall rate reduction value of PV as system size increases relative to customer load. {sm_bullet} The ability of PV to offset demand charges is highly customer-specific. Customers with loads that peak in the afternoon are often able to receive significant demand charge savings across a wide variety of circumstances, at least at lower levels of PV output relative to building load. In contrast, facilities with flat or inverted load profiles will often not earn much demand charge reduction value, regardless of PV system size. {sm_bullet} The type of demand charge can impact the ability of PV to offer savings. Time-of-day (TOD) -based demand charges are found to be more favorable to PV under a broad range of (Abstract truncated...|$|R
