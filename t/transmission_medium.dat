5|$|The {{principal}} {{application of}} Apollonius' problem, as formulated by Isaac Newton, is hyperbolic trilateration, {{which seeks to}} determine a position from the differences in distances to at least three points. For example, a ship may seek to determine its position from the differences in arrival times of signals from three synchronized transmitters. Solutions to Apollonius' problem were used in World War I to determine the location of an artillery piece from the time a gunshot was heard at three different positions, and hyperbolic trilateration is the principle used by the Decca Navigator System and LORAN. Similarly, the location of an aircraft may be determined from the difference in arrival times of its transponder signal at four receiving stations. This multilateration problem {{is equivalent to the}} three-dimensional generalization of Apollonius' problem and applies to global positioning systems such as GPS. It is also used to determine the position of calling animals (such as birds and whales), although Apollonius' problem does not pertain if the speed of sound varies with direction (i.e., the <b>transmission</b> <b>medium</b> not isotropic).|$|E

25|$|In the {{metamaterial}} literature, {{medium or}} media refers to <b>transmission</b> <b>medium</b> or optical medium. In 2002 {{a group of}} researchers {{came up with the}} idea that in contrast to materials that depended on resonant behavior, non-resonant phenomena could surpass narrow bandwidth constraints of the wire/split-ring resonator configuration. This idea translated into a type of medium with broader bandwidth abilities, negative refraction, backward waves, and focusing beyond the diffraction limit.|$|E
25|$|Attenuation {{in fiber}} optics, {{also known as}} {{transmission}} loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) as it travels through the <b>transmission</b> <b>medium.</b> Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation {{is an important factor}} limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the attenuation and maximizing the amplification of the optical signal.|$|E

500|$|The other {{meaning of}} the term [...] "channel" [...] in {{telecommunications}} is seen in the phrase communications channel, which is a subdivision of a <b>transmission</b> <b>medium</b> {{so that it can be}} used to send multiple streams of information simultaneously. For example, one radio station can broadcast radio waves into free space at frequencies in the neighborhood of 94.5MHz (megahertz) while another radio station can simultaneously broadcast radio waves at frequencies in the neighborhood of 96.1MHz. Each radio station would transmit radio waves over a frequency bandwidth of about 180kHz (kilohertz), centered at frequencies such as the above, which are called the [...] "carrier frequencies". Each station in this example is separated from its adjacent stations by 200kHz, and the difference between 200kHz and 180kHz (20kHz) is an engineering allowance for the imperfections in the communication system.|$|E

However, only limited information relating to the feeding of such waveguides is available.

The assorted aether theories embody the various conceptions of this [...] "medium" [...] and [...] "substance". This early modern aether has little in common with the aether of classical elements from which the name was borrowed.
