5|$|Brisingr is {{the third}} novel in the Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini. It was {{released}} on September 20, 2008. Originally, Paolini intended <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> the then Inheritance Trilogy in three books, but during writing the third book he decided that the series was too complex <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> in one book, because the single book would be close to 1,500 pages long. A deluxe edition of Brisingr, which includes removed scenes and previously unseen art, was released on October 13, 2009.|$|E

5|$|After {{months of}} not {{working on the}} poem, Eliot began to feel {{compelled}} to finish it; {{it was not until}} August 1942, however, that he started working on it again. In total, there were five drafts. The poem was finished by 19 September 1942 and published in the October New English Weekly. Little Gidding was intended <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> the Four Quartets series, summarising Eliot's views expressed in this series of poems.|$|E
5|$|At first, Hitler rebuffed Soviet {{diplomatic}} {{hints that}} Stalin desired a treaty; but in early August 1939, Hitler authorised Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to begin serious negotiations. A trade agreement was concluded on 18 August; and on 22 August, Ribbentrop flew to Moscow <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> a formal non-aggression treaty. Although the treaty {{is known as}} the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, it was Stalin and Hitler, and not Molotov and Ribbentrop, who decided the content of the treaty.|$|E

5|$|By 917, Simeon was {{preparing}} for yet another war against Byzantium. He attempted <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> an anti-Byzantine union with the Pechenegs, but his envoys could not match the financial resources of the Byzantines, who succeeded in outbidding them. The Byzantines hatched a large-scale campaign against Bulgaria and also tried to persuade the Serbian Prince Petar Gojniković to attack the Bulgarians with Magyar support.|$|E
5|$|Béla was crowned king on 6 December 1060, but {{the young}} German king's advisors, who were staunch {{supporters}} of Solomon (the fiancé of their monarch's sister), refused <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> a peace treaty with him.

5|$|Creating {{a native}} pet {{industry}} in Australia related to quolls could aid in their conservation. However, concerns exist about this methodology {{in regards to}} animal husbandry, conservation benefits, and other issues. Some scientists believe that keeping quolls as pets could aid in their long-term conservation, but {{further research is needed}} on this topic <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> whether this is true or false.|$|E

5|$|In 1666, Newton {{observed}} that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism {{in the position of}} minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles. This led him <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> that colour is a property intrinsic to light—a point which had been debated in prior years.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Brownell et al. reevaluated the {{conservation}} {{status of the}} North Pacific right whale as a distinct species, and in 2002, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) accepted Rosenbaum's findings, and recommended that the Eubalaena nomenclature be retained for this genus. A 2007 study by Churchill provided further evidence <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> the three living right whale species do comprise a phylogenetic lineage, distinct from the bowhead, and are rightly classified into two separate genera.|$|E

40|$|The paper focusses on {{the most}} widely spread {{linguistic}} elements through which historians mark their shift <b>to</b> <b>concluding</b> remarks in historical research articles in Italian and English.

5|$|Nuttin {{analyzed}} {{the data to}} see if there was a national-letter effect, but failed to find one. Norwegians did not favor the letter N (for Norge) more than people from other countries did, neither did the Hungarians favor the letter M (for Magyarország). This led Nuttin <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> that individual ownership has affective consequences that are not observed for collective ownership.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, the WSB's {{spokesman}} {{stated that}} the remaining six members of the patrol, who had now been held for over a fortnight, would only be released after a new government was formed in Sierra Leone, leading negotiators <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> that the increasingly unrealistic demands were stalling tactics rather than a serious attempt <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> the crisis. At around the same time, teams that had been observing the West Side Boys' base for four days {{reported that they had}} seen no sign of the captive soldiers in that time. There were also concerns that an assault would become more dangerous if the West Side Boys moved the hostages. The combination of these factors led COBRA to order an extraction mission.|$|E
