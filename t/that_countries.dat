5|$|Either way, {{many of the}} {{countries}} involved in the crisis are on the euro, so devaluation, individual interest rates, and capital controls are not available. The only solution left to raise a country's level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits. For example, if a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this would reduce its trade deficit. It has therefore been suggested <b>that</b> <b>countries</b> with large trade deficits (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.|$|E
5|$|Germany has an {{installed}} capacity {{of wind and}} solar that can exceed daily demand, and has been exporting peak power to neighboring countries, with exports which amounted to some 14.7 billion kWh in 2012. A more practical solution is the installation of thirty days storage capacity able to supply 80% of demand, which will become necessary when most of Europe's energy is obtained from wind power and solar power. Just as the EU requires member countries to maintain 90 days strategic reserves of oil it can be expected <b>that</b> <b>countries</b> will provide electric power storage, instead of expecting to use their neighbors for net metering.|$|E
5|$|Other {{commentators}} {{believe that}} the euro is under attack so <b>that</b> <b>countries,</b> such as the UK and the US, can continue to fund their large external deficits and government deficits, and to avoid {{the collapse of the}} US$. The US and UK do not have large domestic savings pools to draw on and therefore are dependent on external savings e.g. from China. This is not the case in the eurozone, which is self-funding.|$|E

WHO notes in the strategy <b>that</b> <b>countries</b> are experiencing seven challenges to such implementation, namely in developing and enforcing policy; in integration; in safety and quality, especially in assessment of products and qualification of practitioners; in controlling advertising; in research and development; in education and training; and in the sharing of information.|$|E
5|$|Malaria is {{presently}} endemic {{in a broad}} band around the equator, {{in areas of the}} Americas, many parts of Asia, and much of Africa; in Sub-Saharan Africa, 85â€“90% of malaria fatalities occur. An estimate for 2009 reported <b>that</b> <b>countries</b> with the highest death rate per 100,000 of population were Ivory Coast (86.15), Angola (56.93) and Burkina Faso (50.66). A 2010 estimate indicated the deadliest countries per population were Burkina Faso, Mozambique and Mali. The Malaria Atlas Project aims to map global endemic levels of malaria, providing a means with which to determine the global spatial limits of the disease and to assess disease burden. This effort led to the publication of a map of P.falciparum endemicity in 2010. As of 2010, about 100 countries have endemic malaria. Every year, 125 million international travellers visit these countries, and more than 30,000 contract the disease.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August 1936, the United States {{had made}} it known that it would follow a policy of non-intervention, but did not {{announce}} it officially. This isolationism on the Spanish war would later be identified as disastrous by Under-Secretary of State Sumner Welles. Five days later, the Glenn L. Martin Company enquired whether the government would allow the sale of eight bombers to the Spanish Republican Air Force; the response was negative. It also confirmed it would not take part in several mediation attempts, including one by the Organization of American States. Mexico soon became the first nation to openly support the Republicans. On 15 August, the United Kingdom banned exports of war material to Spain. Neurath also agreed to the pact, and suggested that volunteers (many of whom would eventually form the International Brigades) be included. Italy similarly agreed, signing on 21 August after a determined diplomatic offensive by Britain and France. Although a surprising reversal of views, it has been put down to the growing belief <b>that</b> <b>countries</b> could not abide by the agreement anyway. Admiral Raeder urged the German government either to back the Nationalists more completely, and bring Europe {{to the brink of}} war, or to abandon them. On the 24th, Germany signed.|$|E

5|$|To {{deal with}} this {{shortage}} of educational opportunities, Scott Weiner et al. suggest <b>that</b> <b>countries</b> with developed emergency medical systems should focus on training the trainers. This, he believes, is a sustainable approach to promote the development of emergency medicine worldwide. It works by sending developed country health care workers to equip {{a small group of}} trainees with the necessary skills to then go on and teach the concepts to others. As such, it may be able to leverage the insights of developed emergency medical systems while remaining sustainable, as the newly trained trainers continue to spread the knowledge. The Tuscan Emergency Medicine Initiative is an example, with physicians from other specialties currently working in emergency departments being taught how to teach a new group of emergency medical specialists.|$|E
5|$|Non-intervention, {{and with}} it the Non-Intervention Agreement, had been {{proposed}} in a joint diplomatic initiative by the governments of France and the United Kingdom, in order to prevent the war from escalating into a major pan-European conflict. On 4 August 1936, non-intervention was put to Nazi Germany by the French. The German position was that such a declaration was not needed, but discussions could be held on preventing the spread of the war to the rest of Europe, so long as the USSR was present. It was mentioned at that meeting that Germany was already supplying the Nationalists. On 9 August, the Germans informed the British that 'no war materials had been sent from Germany and none will', which was blatantly false. One German Junker aircraft was captured when it came down in Republican territory. Its release would be required before Germany signed the Non-Intervention Pact. There was a growing belief <b>that</b> <b>countries</b> would not abide by the agreement anyway. Admiral Erich Raeder urged the German government to either back the Nationalists more completely, and bring Europe to the brink of war, or abandon them. On the 24th, Germany signed. It was at this point that the Non-Intervention Committee was created to uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing of the USSR and Germany had already become apparent. Germany consistently broke the agreement they had signed.|$|E
