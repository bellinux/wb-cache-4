40|$|The {{effect of}} the two {{substituted}} pyrimidines, ancymidol (a growth retardant) and <b>triarimol</b> (a fungicide) on Phaseolus vulgaris was studied. Both compounds retarded shoot and root elongation as well as increases in fresh weight. Both compounds caused production of ethylene-like responses when given in high dosages or when applied shortly after germination. As growth retardation was shown {{to occur in the}} absence of net increase in sterol levels, neither ancymidol nor <b>triarimol</b> apparently retards growth by inhibiting sterol synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Miconazole at minimal fungitoxic {{concentrations}} inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis in sporidia of Ustilago maydis {{by interference}} with sterol C 14 demethylation. The action {{is analogous to}} that of the fungicides <b>triarimol</b> and fenarimol. The fungicide 1 -dodecylimidazole at low concentrations (0. 1 to 0. 25 μg/ml) inhibits sterol C 14 demethylation; however, at higher concentrations (1. 0 μg/ml or greater) it also inhibits 2, 3 -oxidosqualene cyclization and subsequent transmethylation. It is postulated that this diversity of effects of 1 -dodecylimidazole results from binding of the inhibitor to sterol carrier protein(s) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{fungicide}} α-(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) -α-phenyl- 5 -pyrimidine {{methyl alcohol}} (<b>triarimol)</b> {{and four other}} structural analogs of this substance, in which {{one or more of}} the substituents were varied, were tested for their comparative effects on growth and gibberellin biosynthesis in the fungus Gibberella fujikuroi. Each of the five analogs tested was capable of inhibiting growth as measured by dry weight in 5 -day-old cultures. Three of them [α-(2 -chlorophenyl) -α-(4 -chlorophenyl) - 5 -pyrimidine methyl alcohol, fenarimol; α-(2 -chlorophenyl) -α-(4 -fluorophenyl) - 5 -pyrimidine methyl alcohol, nuarimol; and triarimol] were effective at appreciably lower concentrations than the other two [α-(4 -chlorophenyl) -α-(1 -methylethyl) - 5 -pyrimidine methyl alcohol, experimental compound EL 509; and α-cyclopropyl-α-(4 -methoxyphenyl) - 5 -pyrimidine methyl alcohol, ancymidol]...|$|E
40|$|A key step in {{gibberellin}} biosynthesis is {{the conversion}} of ent-kaurenoic acid to ent- 7 [alpha]-hydroxykaurenoic acid, mediated by the enzyme kaurenoic acid hydroxylase. A cell-free system obtained from Gibberella fujikuroi (Saw.) Wr. was used to characterize kaurenoic acid hydroxylase activity. Microsomal preparations from disrupted fungal cells, {{in the presence of}} O 2 and NADPH, converted [17 - 14 C]ent-kaurenoic acid to oxidation products that were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and identified as ent- 7 [alpha]-hydroxykaurenoic acid and gibberellin A 14 by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Flavin adenine dinucleotide and the chloride salts of several monovalent cations stimulated {{the conversion of}} ent-kaurenoic acid to these products, whereas CO and a number of known inhibitors of cytochrome P- 450 -dependent reactions, including paclobutrazol, tetcyclacis, BAS 111. W, flurprimidol, <b>triarimol,</b> metyrapone, and 1 -phenylimida-zole, significantly reduced kaurenoic acid hydroxylase activity. Kaurenoic acid hydroxylase was solubilized from fungal microsomes by treatment with 1 M KCl. The properties of the enzyme noted above suggest that kaurenoic acid hydroxylase from G. fujikuroi is a cytochrome P- 450 -dependent monooxygenase...|$|E
40|$|Abscisic acid (ABA) is an {{important}} plant hormone involved in controlling normal growth and development in higher plants. The fungus Cercospora rosicola synthesizes large quantities of ABA (Assante et al., 1977), which has made it a useful organism for studies of ABA biosynthesis;The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the ABA biosynthetic pathway in C. rosicola. Feeding experiments with labeled mevalonic acid (MVA), farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), and 1 [superscript] 2 ̆ 7 -deoxy-ABA have confirmed the conversion of these intermediates into ABA. This conversion was inhibited in the fungicide triarimol-treated cultures fed with MVA and FPP, but not 1 [superscript] 2 ̆ 7 -deoxy-ABA;The development of a cell-free enzyme system from fungal extracts capable of converting any of these intermediates into ABA has not been previously reported. A cell-free enzyme system has been developed in our laboratory to convert 1 [superscript] 2 ̆ 7 -deoxy-[superscript] 2 H-ABA into [superscript] 2 H-ABA. The reaction products were chromatographed by reverse phase HPLC. The presumptive ABA fractions were collected and [superscript] 2 H-ABA was quantified by GC-MS using a [superscript] 2 H-ABA standard curve. 1 [superscript] 2 ̆ 7 -deoxy-[superscript] 2 H-ABA was converted to an average of 1. 47 pmol [superscript] 2 H-ABA mg[superscript]- 1 protein min[superscript]- 1. Most of the enzymatic activity was found in the microsomal fraction. The reaction required NADPH and was enhanced by FAD; it was not inhibited by <b>triarimol.</b> These data, taken together, suggest that cytochrome P- 450 may be involved in some oxidative reactions prior to 1 [superscript] 2 ̆ 7 -deoxy-ABA in the ABA biosynthetic pathway;The phytopathogenic fungi Gnomonia veneta and Cercospora mori infect sycamore and mulberry leaves, respectively. These fungi do not appear to produce ABA in liquid cultures. However, infected leaves with these fungi contain elevated levels of ABA and abscise prematurely...|$|E
