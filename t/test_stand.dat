25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the ALT test flight program, on March 13, 1978, Enterprise was flown once again, but this time halfway across the country to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Alabama for the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Testing (MGVT). The orbiter was lifted up on a sling very similar to the one used at Kennedy Space Center and placed inside the Dynamic <b>Test</b> <b>Stand</b> building, and there mated to the Vertical Mate Ground Vibration Test tank (VMGVT-ET), which in turn was attached to a set of inert Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB) to form a complete shuttle launch stack, and marked {{the first time in the}} program's history that all Space Shuttle elements, an Orbiter, an External Tank (ET), and two SRBs, were mated together. During the course of the program, Enterprise and the rest of the launch stack would be exposed to a punishing series of vibration tests simulating as closely as possible those expected during various phases of launch, some tests with and others without the SRBs in place.|$|E
25|$|He was {{prominent}} in the Fourth Test when he started his pairing with Lawry {{at the top of}} the order at Old Trafford. An Australian victory would result in a 2–1 lead and the retention of the Ashes. Their first <b>Test</b> <b>stand</b> together was not successful; Simpson fell for four as Australia made only 190. After taking 4/23 in the English first innings, removing Ken Barrington for 78 and cleaning up the tail with three more wickets, despite which England had a first-innings lead of 177. He scored 51 in the second innings in a century stand with Lawry—the first by either team in the series—which allowed Australia to reach set a winning target on the last day. Early on, England appeared destined for the target, as Dexter plundered 21 from Simpson's first four overs. However, the English batsman fell and Simpson did not concede a run in his remaining four overs. He claimed the wicket of Fred Trueman as England collapsed to be all out for 201 on the final afternoon to cede the Ashes. After the triumph at Old Trafford, Simpson had a run of heavy-scoring in the county matches before the final Test, scoring 116, 132 and 6, and 160, ending unbeaten in all but the last innings, against Glamorgan, Warwickshire and Yorkshire. He added a further 3/21 and 3/48 in the last of these matches, although the hosts still managed to hang on for a draw.|$|E

500|$|Dynamic tests came {{in three}} configurations, {{one for each}} phase of Saturn V-powered flight. [...] Configuration I focused on testing the entire stack, as if the vehicle had just launched. [...] Configuration II {{exercised}} the stack as if the first stage had jettisoned and the second stage were firing, and configuration III tested just the third stage and Apollo spacecraft. [...] Tests began with Configuration III in the Saturn IB Dynamic Test Facility, while the Saturn V Dynamic <b>Test</b> <b>Stand,</b> first, and second stages were still under construction. [...] Configuration I testing followed in the Saturn V Dynamic <b>Test</b> <b>Stand,</b> then Configuration II in the same place.|$|E
500|$|Configuration I {{dynamic tests}} {{required}} {{the first stage}} of the Saturn V, which was loaded into the <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> January 13, 1966. [...] Testing would {{have to wait for the}} last piece, the second stage, to arrive.|$|E
500|$|The Saturn V Dynamic <b>Test</b> <b>Stand</b> with [...] "electrodynamic shakers" [...] {{provided}} a table capable {{not only of}} holding the Saturn V fully assembled and fueled, but also able to simulate the vibrations that would be generated by rocket engines.|$|E

[...] From [...] 1953 to 1961, 362 static rocket tests were conducted there, including 200 that led directly to improvements in the Redstone rocket for the Mercury manned flight program.
