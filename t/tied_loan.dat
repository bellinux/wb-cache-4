40|$|Since 1970, U. S. law has {{prohibited}} banks from <b>tying</b> their <b>loans</b> {{to other}} non-banking products, {{even if the}} bundle of services is offered at a discount to customers. Sometimes in the temporary zeal to enforce a particular law, policymakers forget to ask the basic {{question of whether the}} underlying law makes sense. In this case, it doesn't. Robert Litan argues that the time clearly has come for the flat prohibition against bank <b>tying</b> of <b>loans</b> to be replaced by the rules of the antitrust laws. Of course, the law requiring banks to book their loans at arms-length market terms should remain in force to prevent banks from under-pricing their loans in order to land other business. Too radical, you might say. Then, Litan recommendsinitially replace the tying prohibition with an antitrust rule only for the large, publicly held companies that already have issued or want to issue commercial paper, the market's best alternative to bank lending. Why shouldn't these borrowers get the same benefits that they can get when purchasing other goods and services? Also, viewDr. Litan's press releasefor this article.

Nevertheless, complaints continued that even Japan's untied aid tended to be directed toward purchases from Japan.

40|$|In {{cities around}} the world, public water systems have {{increasingly}} come to be operated by private companies. Along with an internationally funded investment program to refurbish the dilapidated water infrastructure, private operations were tested also in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Only {{about a third of}} the households, however, are reached by the piped water system there; most households purchase water from those with pipe-connections or private boreholes. Thus, water distribution was informally privatized by way of water vending long before formal private sector participation began. This thesis explores individual and collective endeavors in water development, distribution, and access, along with the global and local influences that shaped the privatization exercise. With regard to the lease of Dar es Salaam’s water system, the institutional set-up has been found to mix the British and French models, having influenced the local situation through development assistance and conditionalities <b>tied</b> to <b>loans.</b> The institutional contradictions may have contributed to the conflictive cancellation of the lease arrangement. Due to the public utility company’s lack of operating capital and investment planning, infrastructure development has responded mainly to immediate individual demands, resulting in a spaghetti-like network and structural leakage. The long-standing under-performance and low coverage of the piped water system have forced many people to devise their own ways to access water. This thesis argues that the individually-devised artisan ways of water provisioning constitute the life-line of Dar es Salaam’s water system. Yet, they also undermine and divert resources away from the collectively-devised industrial form of piped water provision...|$|R

Different types of agreements appeared, characterized by different finance structures. In this study, the authors aimed at verifying the causal relation between the type of financing used by soy producers in Brazil and their possible determinants. Two arrangements were chosen for analysis: getting bank loans and getting <b>loans</b> <b>tied</b> to transactions with agro-industrial chain agents. The explanatory variables used were property size, guarantees provided and reputation, measured in terms of how long the relationship had existed for. As foreseen in the theory, results showed that property size is one of the determinants of credit transactions between farmers and agro-industrial chain agents. However, the relation with government banks and the guarantees did not turn out to be relevant elements for the analysis of the determinants in the choice of {{contractual arrangements}} for soy financing with agents of the agro-industrial system...|$|R

There {{has also been a}} concern that these losses in the future will be increasing due to population growth in hazard prone areas and climate change creating more disasters than in the past. This article explores the importance of insurance coupled with other policy instruments, such as regulations and standards, and interested parties (e. g., banks and financial institutions) to encourage loss reduction measures and provide financial protection against these hazards. New advances in information technology and risk assessment coupled with the emergence of new financial instruments for covering large losses provide the ingredients for rethinking the way society deals with catastrophic risks.

We use a large and original dataset containing 802 mapped social networks of borrowers from Pro Mujer Mexico. This is the first paper to look at external ties, i. e. social ties with individuals outside the borrowing group. Our main finding is that group lending with joint liability works when group borrowers use the informal risk insurance arrangement embedded in their external ties as guarantee for loan repayment. The extent to which this informal arrangement is used as guarantee is not decided by the borrower, but it {{is determined by the}} configuration of the group borrowers’ social networks, i. e. by their overlapping networks. These overlapping networks (or information channels) facilitate the diffusion of information into each other’s networks, and, thus, increases the credibility of the threat of losing one’s informal risk insurance arrangement in case of default.
