The medical procedure began at 7:09a.m. EDT and ended at 7:29a.m. EDT. Bush woke up twenty minutes later, {{but did not}} resume his presidential powers and duties until 9:24a.m. EDT after the president's physician, Richard Tubb, conducted an overall examination. Tubb said he recommended the additional <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the sedative had no aftereffects. Unlike Reagan's 1985 letter, Bush's 2002 letter specifically cited Section 3 as the authority for the transfer of power.|$|E

He reclaimed his powers at 9:21am. EDT. In both cases, Bush specifically cited Section 3 when he transferred the Presidential powers to the Vice President and when he reclaimed those powers.|$|E

He urged fans to be patient, as most signings would happen during July. He was aiming for a minimum squad size of 23, and expected to retain Larsson and McFadden. The club decided to activate the one-year option on Tunisian midfielder Mehdi Nafti's contract, which had been due to expire in June. McLeish told Maik Taylor he would remain as first-choice goalkeeper if he agreed a new contract; Taylor signed a two-year deal a few weeks later. It was confirmed that Everton midfielder Lee Carsley would join Birmingham on a free transfer when his contract expired.|$|E

60|$|And {{he began}} to cross-question her about what she had done. Maria denied nothing, and when she had finished, the king said again, 'Follow me to the house, and there you shall pay the penalty.' As he spoke, he started for the house, looking back from time to <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that Maria had not run away. All of a sudden, when he glanced round, he found she had {{vanished}} completely, without leaving a trace of where she had gone. Search was made all through the town, {{and there was not}} a hole or corner which was not ransacked, {{but there was no sign}} of her anywhere. This so enraged the king that he became quite ill, and for many months his life was despaired of.|$|E
60|$|Away again, {{this time}} on foot, along the sun-baked pavements, through courts and alleys into a narrow, busy street in the {{neighbourhood}} of Shoreditch. He stopped at last before a factory and looked tentatively up at the windows. Through the opened panes came the constant click of sewing machines, the smell of cloth, the vision of many heads bent over their work. He stood where he was for a time and watched. The place was like a hive of industry. Row after row of girls were there, seated side by side, round-shouldered, bending over their machines, looking neither to the right nor to the left, struggling to keep up to <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> of the wage which was life or death to them. It was nothing to them that above the halo of smoke the sky was blue; or that away beyond the murky horizon, the sun, which here in the narrow street seemed to have drawn all life from the air, was shining on yellow cornfields bending before the west wind. Here there was simply an intolerable heat, a smell of fish and a smell of cloth.|$|E

60|$|He {{unwrapped}} {{his pack}} {{and the first}} thing he did was to count his matches. There were sixty-seven. He counted them three <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure.</b> He divided them into several portions, wrapping them in oil paper, disposing of one bunch in his empty tobacco pouch, of another bunch in the inside band of his battered hat, of a third bunch under his shirt on the chest. This accomplished, a panic came upon him, and he unwrapped them all and counted them again. There were still sixty-seven.|$|R
50|$|As the DHIII {{does not}} have wheels, it does not land like most {{airplanes}} do. It {{is important that the}} vehicle lands as close to horizontally as possible. To perform a proper skid landing, the operator must take into account, the angle of descent, the wind, and the terrain on which the vehicle is landing. The operator of the DHIII may bring the device around multiple <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the landing goes smoothly. The aircraft is designed to break apart on impact, to dissipate its kinetic energy without causing damage to the components so they can be reused.|$|R
6000|$|Another typical {{wrong to}} the old Rome, or rather to the not-yet Rome, was the building-up, beyond the Tiber, of the Quarter of the Fields, so called, where Zola in his novel of Rome has placed most of the squalor which he so lavishly employs in its contrasts. In these he shows himself the romanticist that he always frankly owned he was in spite of himself; but after I had read his book I made it my affair to visit the scenes of poverty and misery in the Quartiere dei Prati. When I did so I found that I had already passed through the quarter without noting {{anything}} especially poor or specifically miserable, and I went a third <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that I had not overlooked something impressively lamentable. But I did not see above three tenement-houses with the wash hung from the windows, and with the broken shutters of poverty and misery, in a space where on the East Side or the North Side in New York I could have counted such houses by the score, almost the hundred. In this quarter the streets were swept every morning as they are everywhere in Rome, and though toward noon they were beginning to look as slovenly as our streets look when they have just been [...] "cleaned," [...] I knew that the next morning these worst avenues of Rome would be swept as our best never have been {{since the days of}} Waring.|$|E
60|$|And lo!--on Christmas day Roche {{came back}} so drunk that his nurse Mignan {{took him to}} his bedroom and turned the key of the door on him. But you must not do this to a Breton {{fisherman}} full of drink and claustrophobia. It {{was one of those}} errors even Frenchmen may make, to the after sorrow of their victims. One of the female 'Powers,' standing outside, heard a roar, the crash of a foot against the panel of a door, and saw Roche, 'like a great cat' come slithering through the hole. He flung his arm out, brushed the 'Power' back against the wall, cried out fiercely: 'La boîte--je ne veux pas la boîte!' and rushed for the stairs. Here were other female 'Powers'; he dashed them aside and passed down. But in the bureau at the foot was a young Corporal of the 'Legion Etrangère'--a Spaniard who had volunteered for France--great France; he ran out, took Roche gently by the arm, and offered to drink with him. And so they sat, those two, in the little bureau, drinking black coffee, while the young Corporal talked like an angel and Roche like a wild man--about his mother, about his dead brother who had been sitting on his bed, as he said, about 'la boîte,' and the turning of that key. And slowly he became himself--or so they thought--and all went in to supper. Ten minutes later one of the 'Powers,' looking for the twentieth <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> he was eating, saw an empty place: he had slipped out like a shadow and was gone again. A big cavalryman and the Corporal retrieved him that night from a café near the station; they had to use force at times to bring him in. Two days later he was transferred to a town hospital, where discipline would not allow him to get drunk or climb trees. For the 'Powers' had reasoned thus: To climb trees is bad; to get drunk is bad; but to do both puts on us too much responsibility; he must go! They had, in fact, been scared. And so he passed away to a room under the roof of a hospital in the big town miles away--la boîte indeed!--where for liberty he must use a courtyard without trees, and but little tobacco came to his cheek; and there he eats his heart out to this day, perhaps. But some say he had no heart--only the love of drink, and climbing. Yet, on that last evening, to one who was paying him for a little net, he blurted out: 'Some day I will tell you something--not now--in a year's time. Vous êtes le seul--!' What did he mean by that, if he had no heart to eat?... The night after he had gone, a little black dog strayed up, and among the trees barked and barked at some portent or phantom. 'Ah! the camel! Ah! the pig! I had him on my back all night!' Grandpère Poirot said next morning. That was the very last of Flotsam....|$|E

50|$|Henckel von Donnersmarck was {{assisted}} by stunt coordinator Simon Crane who devised the boat action sequence. In the DVD director's commentary, Henckel von Donnersmarck recounts that the film's one action sequence was devised by Simon Crane {{to allow for}} the speed limitations imposed on boats in Venice.
