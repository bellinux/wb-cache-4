5|$|During the All Black tour of Australia, in {{the game}} against Metropolitan Union in Sydney on 5 August 1914, the news was posted on <b>the</b> <b>scoreboard</b> that the British Empire – and {{therefore}} New Zealand and Australia – had declared war. On the ship home, the players collectively decided to volunteer for military service. Three of them were killed, including Downing at Gallipoli, Bobby Black at the Somme and Jim McNeece at Messines.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} in the game came from special teams and turnovers. Virginia Tech turned the ball over three times, while Kansas turned the ball over just once. Kansas converted its three takeaways into 17points, giving the Jayhawks an enormous advantage on <b>the</b> <b>scoreboard.</b> Virginia Tech failed to convert its sole turnover recovery into any points.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, <b>the</b> Unitas Stadium <b>scoreboard</b> was {{replaced}} with a 16:9 full video <b>scoreboard.</b> <b>The</b> new <b>scoreboard</b> stands where <b>the</b> previous <b>scoreboard</b> was placed. <b>The</b> old incandescent light scoreboard was recycled and a new smaller LED scoreboard was installed in the opposite endzone.|$|R

5|$|A few {{controversial}} {{studies have}} linked performance to initials. However, McCullough and Williams {{found no evidence}} of a name-letter effect for the letter 'K' in baseball players striking out (shown on <b>the</b> <b>scoreboard</b> with a 'K'), despite an earlier study by Nelson and Simmons suggesting there was. Nelson and Simmons also found that students with first name initials C or D get lower grades than others with initials A or B.Again, McCullough and Williams criticized the statistical analysis used and found no evidence to support such a relation.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the mayor}} of Richmond granted the pair {{the freedom of the}} city. <b>The</b> <b>{{scoreboard}}</b> at Punt Road Oval, Richmond's home ground was named the Ring-Johnston scoreboard in honour of their feat. Johnston took match figures of 3/55 in the Fifth Test as Australia completed the series with a win. Johnston ended the season by taking a total of 7/86 in Victoria's innings win over South Australia. He ended the entire first-class season with 54 wickets at 20.63.|$|E
5|$|During the 1993 {{run for the}} {{national}} title, Smith used a method that was introduced to him {{at a conference in}} Switzerland. At the conference, Smith was presented a tape by a lecturer who used doctored images to achieve his goal of losing weight. The photos showed the lecturer what he would look like if he were thinner as motivation to reach his weight-loss goals. Smith took a picture of <b>the</b> <b>scoreboard</b> from the 1982 Championship, modified it to read 1993 and erased the name Georgetown, leaving that space blank. He proceeded to place copies of the doctored photo in all of the players' lockers.|$|E
25|$|The stadium {{control area}} {{is in the}} {{southwest}} area of the ground, between the South and West stands.

50|$|During the 1998-1999 hockey season, a new four-sided {{scoreboard}} {{was added}} {{to the center of the}} Field House, replacing <b>the</b> <b>scoreboards</b> on <b>the</b> eastern and western walls.|$|R
50|$|Both {{also worked}} in other fields: amongst his post-war {{projects}} were <b>the</b> electric <b>scoreboards</b> for <b>the</b> 1952 Davis Cup and the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. <b>The</b> Olympic <b>scoreboard</b> {{was made up}} of 10,000 light bulbs and could show all of the letters of the alphabet along with numerals. Along with <b>the</b> <b>scoreboards</b> two versions of a pen recorder were developed and produced by Both: one was used as Woomera for weapons research and the other was used for Antarctic Research, the CSIRO, universities, hospitals and medical and industrial research.|$|R
5|$|In that half, the Tech offense {{finally got}} rolling. The Hokies scored 14points {{in both the}} third and fourth quarters, ending the game on an uncontested 280 run. Alabama's offense was stifled {{throughout}} by effective pressure from Tech defensive end Corey Moore, and Tech was able to turn several fumbles and interceptions by the Crimson Tide into points on <b>the</b> <b>scoreboard.</b> The final 387 Virginia Tech victory was the biggest win in Virginia Tech bowl game history, and Moore was named the game's most valuable player. The two teams did not meet again until the 2009 Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game on September 5, 2009.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1981 season, Greer {{underwent}} {{a number of}} renovations including the addition of over 1,200box seats and over 1,000new general admission seats. Two wooden general admission seating areas were replaced by 2,000contoured seats. The original backstop which consisted of several steel poles was upgraded to a steel cable system, eliminating most of the poles. Other stadium upgrades included two new dugouts, three entrance and exit ramps, a new sound system, doubling {{the size of the}} reader panel on <b>the</b> <b>scoreboard,</b> and enlarging the ticket booth. The ballpark's attendance record was set on August 18, 1982, when 22,315people watched the Sounds play against the Columbus Astros.|$|E

5|$|The 1981 Peach Bowl {{kicked off}} on January 2, 1981 at Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. Unlike the 1966 Liberty Bowl, in which Virginia Tech scored first, it was Miami who {{dominated}} the game's early going. The Hurricanes scored a touchdown {{on the first}} drive {{of the game and}} tacked on another touchdown early in the second quarter. Tech was held scoreless in the early going, thanks to twoMiami interceptions at the goal line as Virginia Tech was threatening to score. Late in the second quarter, Tech was finally able to get on <b>the</b> <b>scoreboard</b> with a field goal, but at halftime, the Miami Hurricanes led 14–3.|$|E
5|$|The East Stand at Old Trafford was {{the second}} to be {{converted}} to a cantilever roof, following the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand. It is also {{commonly referred to as}} <b>the</b> <b>Scoreboard</b> End, as it was the location of <b>the</b> <b>scoreboard.</b> The East Stand can currently hold nearly 12,000fans, and is the location of both the disabled fans section and the away section; an experiment involving the relocation of away fans to the third tier of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand was conducted during the 2011–12 season, but the results of the experiments could not be ascertained in time to make the move permanent for the 2012–13 season. The disabled section provides for up to 170 fans, with free seats for carers. Old Trafford was formerly divided into sections, with each section sequentially assigned a letter of the alphabet. Although every section had a letter, it is the K Stand that is the most commonly referred to today. The K Stand fans were renowned for their vocal support for the club, and a large array of chants and songs, though many of them have relocated to the second tier of the West Stand.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of goals created a {{confusion}} over the correct scoreline. At {{the end of the}} match, <b>the</b> <b>scoreboard</b> at the stadium showed 32–0 and Thompson was credited with 14 goals. After the statistician did a recount, the 31–0 scoreline was announced, and Thompson's total goals count was reduced to 13. After the match, FIFA went on to release the official statistics after receiving the official report from the referee and match officials, which confirmed the 31–0 scoreline and Thompson's 13 goals.|$|E

5|$|The line {{score is}} {{displayed}} on the guitar's neck, while the ball/strike/out count, the batter's uniform number, and the hit/error indicator are all situated on the headstock. Six small advertising signs represent the tuning keys. The body of the guitar currently features only an LED display board for displaying messages. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>scoreboard</b> featured two matrix message boards: a low-resolution RGB color board on the left which featured advertising and animations, and a white-light monochromatic board on the right, which primarily featured statistical information and other text-based messages. The monochrome board was replaced by an orange-tinted LED display board in 2009 which served both purposes, while the color board was deactivated and covered with advertising signage. The Greer Stadium scoreboard has never {{had the ability to}} display video or any kind of high-resolution images. Between the two boards are an analog clock and a current temperature display. As of 2014, the temperature display is no longer active. Around the boards are four large spaces for advertising; the two on top are static, and the two on bottom rotate between three images each (the rotating spaces have been covered with static signage since 2009). High-tension nets cover the electronic sections to protect them from home run balls. Above the board is a circular advertising space. This space originally displayed the team's guitar-swinger logo, and at times has displayed other Sounds logos. Originally, when a home run was hit, the guitar-swinger logo would light up and perimeter lights around the entire scoreboard would begin flashing; it was also capable of shooting fireworks after each Sounds home run. By the mid-2000s, <b>the</b> <b>scoreboard</b> had fallen into a state of disrepair and obsolescence, and was only marginally functional. Many of the lights were no longer able to be lit, and replacement parts were becoming hard to find. When MFP Baseball purchased the team in late 2008, the organization made minor renovations to <b>the</b> <b>scoreboard,</b> rendering it once again fully functional, although not to its original specifications. It was also repainted black, red, yellow, and white over its original red, white, and blue color scheme to reflect the team's present colors.|$|E
5|$|The {{match on}} 15 June was {{played at the}} Agricultural Ground in front of 12,000 spectators. NSW soon put points on <b>the</b> <b>scoreboard</b> when O'Donnell marked and Verge kicked a goal. Queensland responded soon after with an {{unconverted}} try, and then, after some fast play, scored a second try, this one converted to put the visitors ahead 4–8. Verge then kicked a penalty goal to bring the difference to one point. The second half was a demonstration of good attacking play and strong defensive work on both sides. The only points scored were from a try for Queensland, giving them a 7–11 win.|$|E
5|$|Though Boston College {{lost the}} game on <b>the</b> <b>scoreboard,</b> it won almost every {{statistical}} category. Quarterback Matt Ryan outperformed both Hokie quarterbacks combined in passing yardage, throwing for 305yards. Ryan was extremely accurate through {{the air in the}} fourth quarter, throwing eight straight complete passes, an ACC Championship Game record. Ryan also was surprisingly successful on the ground, rushing for Boston College's touchdown of the gamea 14-yard sprint in the second quarter that put Boston College ahead 167.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> baseball-style <b>scoreboard</b> {{was created}} for {{televised}} games for audiences not familiar with <b>the</b> club <b>scoreboard.</b> <b>The</b> ends are marked by columns 1 through 10 (or 11 {{for the possibility of}} an extra end to break ties) plus an additional column for the total. Below this are two rows, one for each team, containing the team's score for that end and their total score in the right hand column.|$|R
50|$|The stadium got a {{substantial}} upgrade in 2014 {{with the addition}} of new scoreboards, pools, cabana seating and premium seating that includes 180 field-level seats. <b>The</b> <b>scoreboards</b> are 60 feet high and 362 feet long. <b>The</b> new <b>scoreboards</b> at EverBank Field are now the world's largest video boards. Two 25 feet by 12 feet pools were installed in the north and south end zones along with the cabana seating. The stadium upgrades were $63 million that owner Shahid Khan helped finance $20 million of the total cost.|$|R
500|$|The Cubs' then-owner Philip K. Wrigley {{ordered the}} {{reconstruction}} of the bleachers and the building of <b>the</b> manually operated <b>scoreboard</b> in 1937. <b>The</b> <b>scoreboard's</b> [...] "masthead" [...] was in place by 1938, displaying the American flag at the top and flags representing the eight clubs of the National League on the left and right strands of the masthead, four apiece.

5|$|With the {{momentum}} shifting in the Golden Bears' favor {{and a chance}} to take the lead, it took California three plays to earn a touchdown from its 34-yard line. Rodgers completed a 42-yard pass, then a 14-yard pass, and Adimchinobe Echemandu ran the ball in to the end zone from the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. The score gave California its first lead since the first drive of the game, and with 5:52remaining in the quarter, <b>the</b> <b>scoreboard</b> read 35–28, California. Following the touchdown, Virginia Tech received the ball and had its first three and out of the game. Tech was forced to punt after running three plays for four yards.|$|E
