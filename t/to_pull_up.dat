5|$|Yarbrough's 1937 {{tables were}} based on a Haldanean 3 {{compartment}} model with compartment half-times of 20, 40 and 70 minutes. Ascent rate was chosen to be 25ft per minute, which was a convenient rate <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> a diver in standard dress.|$|E
5|$|The storm made {{launching}} the lifeboats almost impossible. At about 3:00am, Captain Pearce ordered the two port lifeboats lowered, each with four crew on board. While being passed astern {{one of the}} boats broke the painter and became adrift. Her crew tried hard <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> to the ship's side, {{but it was impossible}} in the heavy squall. The other was accidentally let go and both boats, in heavy seas, were unable to be retrieved.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{told the}} men to load their weapons but not to fire unless fired upon, and then ordered them to advance. Laurie ordered the British {{companies}} guarding the bridge to retreat across it. One officer then tried <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> the loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance, but Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge. The Minutemen and militia from Concord, Acton {{and a handful of}} Westford Minutemen, advanced in column formation, two by two, led by Major Buttrick, Lt. Col. Robinson, then Capt. Davis, on the light infantry, keeping to the road, since it was surrounded by the spring floodwaters of the Concord River.|$|E

5|$|Lysacek {{began the}} 2007–2008 {{season at the}} 2007 Skate America. He underrotated and fell on an {{attempted}} quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop in the short program, receiving only one point for that element. He was in second place going into the free skate. He won the free skate, landing a clean quadruple jump, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> to first overall, due to Daisuke Takahashi's twelve point lead after the short program. He {{went on to the}} 2007 Cup of China, where he won the short program with a score of 81.55, improving his personal best by almost thirteen points. He placed second in the free skate after falling on his quadruple jump, and finished second overall to Johnny Weir.|$|E
5|$|The Bearded Man {{demands that}} Fassl kill Fain, beating him {{up when he}} doesn't comply. As she tends to Fassl, Fain first sees the Bearded Man in his place. While staking out Fain's house, the agents see the Bearded Man flee. Doggett pursues the Bearded Man while Reyes finds Fain alive. In the pursuit, Reyes falls through into a sewer, where she finds {{the remains of the}} Bearded Man's victims. After a {{struggle}} with the Bearded Man who is holding Doggett at knife point, Reyes shoots. The Bearded Man falls into the water and Doggett goes after him, only <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> Fassl, much to his confusion. Reyes tries to remind him that it does not matter as long as the case is solved.|$|E
5|$|Greathead had {{originally}} {{planned for the}} trains to be hauled {{by a pair of}} small electric locomotives, one at each end of a train, but the Board of Trade rejected this proposal and a larger locomotive was designed which was able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> to seven carriages on its own. Twenty-eight locomotives were manufactured in America by the General Electric Company (of which syndicate member Darius Ogden Mills was a director) and assembled in the Wood Lane depot. A fleet of 168 carriages was manufactured by the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company and the Brush Electrical Engineering Company. Passengers boarded and left the trains through folding lattice gates {{at each end of the}} carriages; these gates were operated by guards who rode on an outside platform. The CLR {{had originally}} intended to have two classes of travel, but dropped the plan before opening, although its carriages were built with different qualities of interior fittings for this purpose.|$|E

5|$|With all the walkers subdued from Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson)'s barn, Hershel demands Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and {{his group}} leave the farm. Rick confronts Shane (Jon Bernthal) {{regarding}} his actions leading to this, but Shane considers Rick as delusional as Hershel. The group decides to bury the walker bodies of Hershel's wife and stepson as well as Carol (Melissa McBride)'s daughter Sophia, while burning {{the rest of the}} walkers. They hold a makeshift memorial service for Sophia, but Carol refuses to attend. She falls into a deep depression, going off into the woods <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> flowers, including a Cherokee Rose that has been a sign of hope for her. Shane finds her and helps return her to the camp, apologizing to her that he had no idea Sophia was in the barn.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Thursday, and two on Saturday. The Thursday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Thursday morning and afternoon practice sessions were held in dry and hot weather conditions. Michael Schumacher set the fastest time in the first session, at 1 minute and 23.039 seconds, three-tenths of a second quicker than Häkkinen. Coulthard was third fastest, ahead of Fisichella and Frentzen. Alesi managed sixth despite suffering from gearbox issues which caused him <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> on the track. Eddie Irvine, Jenson Button, Barrichello and Salo completed the top ten fastest drivers in the session. Minardi's Gastón Mazzacane spun and lost his front right wheel in a crash at turn 17 and Ralf Schumacher made contact with the barrier at turn eight. In the second practice session, Häkkinen set the quickest lap of the day, a 1:21.387; Coulthard finished with the third fastest time. The McLaren drivers were separated by Michael Schumacher. Eddie Irvine was running quicker and was fourth fastest, in front of Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher. Alesi continued to encounter problems though he managed to be seventh quickest. de la Rosa, Trulli and Barrichello followed in the top ten. Both Nick Heidfeld and Pedro Diniz made contact with the barriers at turn 17 and Wurz crashed {{at the swimming pool}} complex.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{a fourth}} CH-21 {{returned}} to Ap Bac {{to attempt to}} rescue the downed helicopter crews, and it too was heavily damaged by ground fire and forced {{to land on the}} muddy rice field. The Viet Cong had set a new record: the battle was the first time they had either destroyed or downed five helicopters within a few hours. At 13:30, Ba's M113 formation finally closed in on the downed helicopters {{on the west side of}} Ap Bac. The M113s approached the landing zone in single file instead of in formation, and they were immediately fired upon by Viet Cong inside the hamlet who were able to concentrate their fire on one target at a time. The South Vietnamese M113 gun crews were exposed from the waist up, so they were easy targets for snipers; by the end of the day, 14 South Vietnamese M113 crewmen had been killed due to their exposure. The two leading M113s were able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> beside the downed helicopters, but one driver was killed while driving with his head outside of the hatch, and Ba was knocked unconscious inside his carrier.|$|E

25|$|Trains {{arriving}} at Kew were required <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> to {{end of the}} platform verandah. The crossover from 1 to 2 road was usually not in use by the 1950s, and a sleeve was placed across it to prevent its operation. The down home signal at Kew was usually set at proceed, unless required to be placed at stop to operate the interlocking frame.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century {{wine-growing}} became one of the mainstays of the local economy. For this reason the devastation caused by the dual scourge of mildew and phylloxera that hit the region in 1882 came as a particularly heavy blow. The extent of the damage was even greater because the wine-growers initially refused <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> their vines, trying instead to treat them with carbon disulfide, though without success.|$|E

25|$|Subsequent {{depositions}} {{revealed that}} Lt Wilson flew his B-34 {{level with the}} DC-3 and rocked his wings in greeting to First Officer Reppert. When Flight 28 did not respond in kind, the B-34 crossed over the airliner's line of flight and throttled back to allow the slower DC-3 to catch up. Lt Wilson flew close to the airliner to attempt a second greeting, but misjudged {{the distance between the}} aircraft, and when he tried <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up,</b> the B-34's right propeller sliced through the airliner's tail.|$|E
25|$|After a {{dramatic}} but successful {{delivery of the}} bulldozer to the purchasers, they return towards Longyearbyen. They report to Isfjord Radio {{to say they were}} caught in a storm, but deviate on their route back to avoid returning too early. They get caught in actual bad weather and decide <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> in a nearby island, Kjerulføya, north of Nordaustlandet. The following day they go ashore to find food but instead find a cable. They follow the cable until they find a Soviet bearing station. While at the station, they are discovered by the Russians. They return fire after being shot at, killing a Russian; Sverre is wounded.|$|E
25|$|While the {{fighting}} was underway, Air India Flight 224 (a Boeing 707) en route from Harare to Bombay carrying 13 crew and 65 passengers closed in to land for a scheduled refueling. The mercenaries, having just seized the control tower, gave permission for it to land. Berlouis was afraid that the plane might be carrying mercenary reinforcements. He ordered trucks to block the runway while flares were fired to direct the pilot to disengage. At that point the plane was too committed to the landing <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> and proceeded to land. Despite the lack of runway lighting, the pilot managed to maneuver the aircraft around the trucks, though it sustained superficial damage to its right wing.|$|E

25|$|The {{maintenance}} of the canal was {{a real problem for}} the descendants of Riquet. Despite many precautions, the canal silts up with silt from the water supply. In addition it fills with the branches and leaves of trees. Every winter, a period of closure allows the cleaning of the canal. It is necessary to re-dig the canal bed every year for two months. These works are expensive and two months is not always sufficient. Another problem is the invasion of the canal by weeds in the levels and spillways. There is no way to eradicate this scourge. In 1820 dredging was set up <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> the weeds and the mud layer.|$|E
25|$|On May 29 {{he faced}} Ralek Gracie, at the Saitama Super Arena in Dream 14. It {{would be the}} sixth time Sakuraba faced a Gracie, albeit {{this time with a}} deep age difference, given the Japanese (41) and the Brazilian (24)'s {{respective}} ages. During the match, the wrestler performed significantly against the young Gracie, but the latter kept dominating, evidencing a training specialized to counter Sakuraba's style. There was controversy {{towards the end of the}} fight, as Sakuraba seemed to have secured a kimura, only to the referee to pause the match <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> Ralek's pants. The pause allowed the Brazilian to come back with an armbar, which Kazushi escaped to meet a unanimous decision win for Gracie.|$|E
25|$|Denny Hamlin {{took the}} pole {{with a new}} track record, but Brad Keselowski led the most laps. Jimmie Johnson started 20th and worked up to 5th; however, his {{progress}} was stunted by a pit-road collision with Marcos Ambrose. Other contenders Tony Stewart and Kevin Harvick were done in by a pit road speeding penalty and a flat tire, respectively. Kasey Kahne was then taken out after being forced up into the wall by Kyle Busch, causing a crash that also involved Carl Edwards. After the final restart, Keselowski picked up {{a large piece of}} debris on his grill and got passed by Dale Earnhardt, Jr. while trying <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> behind the slower Danica Patrick to remove the debris. Earnhardt would continue to lead and pick up his first career victory at Pocono. The win was the fourth in a row for Hendrick Motorsports in 2014, and the fourth in a row for Hendrick at Pocono with four different drivers.|$|E

5000|$|Event 6 - Eliminator:Sonia led Lynda by {{four points}} {{giving her a}} two-second headstart.

Sonia almost made it up without hassle but tripped but grabbed on to the platform <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> herself <b>up</b> and rope swing through the rope paper and into the quarter finals while Lynda tripped and was downed but on the second go she almost made it up without hassle but tripped but grabbed on to the platform <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> herself <b>up</b> and rope swing through the paper.
