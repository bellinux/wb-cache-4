We use Hapke scattering theory and optical constants measured in this laboratory to examine the ability of mixtures {{of a number of}} organic solids and ices to reproduce the observed spectrum and phase variation. The primary materials considered are poly-HCN, kerogen, Murchison organic extract, <b>Titan</b> <b>tholin,</b> ice tholin, and water ice. In a computer grid search of over 10 million models, we find an intraparticle mixture of 15 % <b>Titan</b> <b>tholin,</b> 10 % poly-HCN, and 75 % water ice with 10 -micrometers particles to provide an excellent fit. Replacing water ice with ammonia ice improves the fits significantly while using a pure hydrocarbon tholin, Tholin alpha, instead of <b>Titan</b> <b>tholin</b> makes only modest improvements. All acceptable fits require <b>Titan</b> <b>tholin</b> or some comparable material to provide the steep slope in the visible, and poly-HCN or some comparable material to provide strong absorption in the near-infrared. A pure <b>Titan</b> <b>tholin</b> surface with 16 -micrometers particles, as well as all acceptable Pholus models, fit the present spectrophotometric data for the transplutonian object 1992 QB(sub 1). The feasibility of gas-phase chemistry to generate material like <b>Titan</b> <b>tholin</b> on such small objects is examined. An irradiated transient atmosphere arising from sublimating ices may generate at most a few centimeters of tholin over the lifetime of the Solar System, but this is insignificant compared to the expected lag deposit of primordial contaminants left behind by the sublimating ice. Irradiation of subsurface N 2 /CH 4 or NH 3 /CH 4 ice by cosmic rays may generate approximately 20 cm of tholin in the upper 10 m of regolith in the same time scale but the identity of this tholin to its gas-phase equivalent has not been demonstrated...|$|E

The lower CH 4 mixing ratio leads to a nitrogen-richer tholin (N/C greater than 1), probably including nitrogen heterocyclic compounds. Unlike <b>Titan</b> <b>tholin,</b> bulk Triton tholin is poor in nitriles. From high-pressure liquid chromatography, ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy, and molecular weight estimation by gel filtration chromatography, we conclude that (1) several H 2 O-soluble fractions, each with distinct UV and IR spectral signatures, are present, (2) these fractions are not identical in the two tholins, (3) the H 2 O-soluble fractions of Titan tholins do not contain significant amounts of nitriles, despite the major role of nitriles in bulk <b>Titan</b> <b>tholin,</b> and (4) the H 2 O-soluble fractions of both tholins are mainly molcules containing about 10 to 50 (C + N) atoms.

Tholin was accumulated for 5 hours in each experiment; the onset of tholin formation is in the range CH 4 /CO 2 = 0. 5 to 1. As the mixing ratio of CH, is increased, the production rate of the brownish tholin film increases.

40|$|We {{report the}} three {{dimensional}} fluorescence spectra of <b>Titan</b> <b>tholins</b> {{in water and}} acetonitrile, and separate some of the fluorescent components of tholins using twodimensional thin layer chromatography. In acetonitrile, tholins exhibit a broad fluorescence with a maximum at 471 nm, and an excitation maximum at 410 nm. The fluorescence spectrum of a water extraction displays a more complicated spectrum with multiple peaks. TLC results indicate the presence {{of at least three}} distinct fluorescent species. In addition, we obtained the two dimensional fluorescence spectrum of tholins in water ice at 77 K, close to the surface temperature of Titan. The fluorescence of tholins in a 77 K ice matrix is red-shifted in comparison to a water solution, and undergoes a further red-shift when the water solution is heated prior to freezing. These results suggest that a simple fluorescence probe could be used on the surface of Titan to identify sites where tholins have been mixed with water, and possibly reveal information about the extent of heating the tholin-water mixture has undergone.

40|$|Compositional {{interpretation}} of remotely obtained reflectance spectra of {{outer solar system}} surfaces is achieved {{by a variety of}} methods. These include matching spectral curves, matching spectral features, quantitative spectral interpretation, and theoretical modeling of spectra. All of these approaches rely upon laboratory measurements of one kind or another. The bulk of these laboratory measurements are obtained with the sample of interest at ambient temperatures and pressures. However, surface temperatures of planets, satellites, and asteroids in the outer solar system are significantly cooler than ambient laboratory conditions on Earth. The infrared spectra of many materials change as a function of temperature. As has been recently demonstrated it is important to assess what effects colder temperatures have on spectral properties and hence, compositional interpretations. <b>Titan</b> <b>tholin</b> is a solid residue created by energetic processing of H-, C-, and N-bearing gases.

40|$|We present {{laboratory}} {{measurements of}} the radiation yields of complex organic solids produced from N 2 /CH 4 gas mixtures containing 10 or 0. 1 % CH 4. These tholins are thought to resemble organic aerosols produced in the atmospheres of Titan, Pluto, and Triton. The tholin yields are large compared to the total yield of gaseous products: nominally, 13 (C + N) / 100 eV for <b>Titan</b> <b>tholin</b> and 2. 1 (C + N) / 100 eV for Triton tholin. High-energy magnetospheric electrons responsible for tholin production represent a class distinct from the plasma electrons considered in models of Titan's airglow. Electrons with E > 20 keV provide an energy flux approximately 1 x 10 (- 2) erg cm- 2 sec- 1, implying from our measured tholin yields a mass flux of 0. 5 to 4. 0 x 10 (- 14) g cm- 2 sec- 1 of tholin. (The corresponding thickness of the tholin sedimentary column accumulated over 4 Gyr on Titan's surface is 4 to 30 m.) This figure is in agreement with required mass fluxes computed from recent radiative transfer and sedimentation models. If, however, these results, derived from experiments at approximately 2 mb, are applied to lower pressure levels toward peak auroral electron energy deposition and scaled with pressure as the gas-phase organic yields, the derived tholin mass flux is at least {{an order of magnitude}} less. We attribute this difference to the fact that tholin synthesis occurs well below the level of maximum electron energy deposition and to possible contributions to tholins from UV-derived C 2 -hydrocarbons. We conclude that <b>Titan</b> <b>tholin,</b> produced by magnetospheric electrons, is alone sufficient to supply at least a significant fraction of Titan's haze [...] a result consistent {{with the fact that the}} optical properties of <b>Titan</b> <b>tholin,</b> among all proposed materials, are best at reproducing Titan's geometric albedo spectrum from near UV to mid-IR in light-scattering models...|$|E
40|$|Tholin {{is a word}} coined to {{describe}} the entire class of complex organic solids produced in laboratory experiments where pre-biotic gaseous chemicals are subject to bombardment by high energy. The atomic composition of <b>Titan</b> <b>tholin</b> produced from 10 percent CH 4 and 90 percent N 2 in a simulation of Titan atmosphere irradiated by charged particles trapped in the magnetosphere of Saturn gave 67 percent C and 33 percent N. Hydrolysis of <b>Titan</b> <b>tholin</b> with 6 N HCl produced a racemic mixture of biological and non-biological amino acids that was confirmed by GC/MS. Other tholins, that revealed the presence of amino acids, were UV tholin produced under possible primitive Earth conditions by irradiation of a mixture of gases (CH 4, C 2 H 6, NH 3, H 2 S and liquid H 2 O) with long-wavelength ultraviolet light, representing the most abundant useful energy source for prebiological organic synthesis; Spark tholin in a crude simulation of Jupiter atmosphere using electrical discharge through a mixture of CH 4, NH 3, and H 2 O vapor. Pyrolytic GC/MS of <b>Titan</b> <b>tholin</b> produced {{more than one hundred}} organic compounds including saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, substituted polycyclic aromatics, nitriles, amines, pyrroles, pyrazines, pyridines, pyrimidines, and the purine, adenine.

A range of two to four ring PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) in Spark as well as Titan tholins, some with one to four alkylation sites, were identified by two-step laser desorption/multiphoton ionization mass spectrometry and also confirmed by the synchronous fluorescence technique. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential for use of tholins as a source of carbon and energy by microbes. This paper describes studies that evaluate the potential for using different types of tholins as (a) a substrate for growing plants and (b) a source of carbon and nitrogen for plants.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first {{results of the}} solid phase analysis of the <b>Titan</b> <b>tholins</b> generated in the Titan Haze Simulation (THS) experiments. This study complements the gas phase analysis study that was presented in a previous publication introducing the THS capabilities. In the THS experiment, the chemistry is simulated by plasma in the stream of a supersonic jet expansion. With this unique design, the gas is jet-cooled to Titan-like temperature (∼ 150 K) before inducing the chemistry by plasma, and remains at low temperature in the plasma discharge (∼ 200 K). Here, we present and discuss the results of scanning electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy studies of THS solid aerosols produced in the four gas mixtures already studied by mass spectrometry in the gas phase: N_ 2 ── CH_ 4, N_ 2 ──CH_ 4 ──C_ 2 H_ 2, N_ 2 ──CH_ 4 ──C_ 6 H_ 6 and N_ 2 ──CH_ 4 ──C_ 2 H_ 2 ──C_ 6 H_ 6. Differences in the morphology of the grains and aggregates produced in {{the volume of the}} gas phase in the plasma cavity, depending on the initial precursors, have been observed by scanning electron microscopy, that appear to be linked to differences in the growth processes and might have an impact on microphysical models. The mid-infrared spectroscopic analysis highlights changes in the nitrogen chemistry, and the abundance of aromatic compounds, depending on the initial gas mixture. A preliminary study of the aging and degradation of the THS samples with time and exposure to air and light has shown the importance, for future studies of laboratory-generated planetary aerosol analogs, of collecting, storing and characterizing samples under controlled environment.

40|$|International audienceIn {{spite of}} {{numerous}} studies {{carried out to}} characterize the chemical composition of laboratory analogues of <b>Titan</b> aerosols (<b>tholins),</b> their molecular composition {{as well as their}} structuration are still little known. If Pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Pyr-GCMS) has been used for years to give clues about this composition, the highly disparate results obtained show that they {{can be attributed to the}} analytical conditions used, to differences in the nature of the analogues studied, or both. In order to have a better description of Titan's tholins molecular composition, we led a systematic analysis of these materials by pyr-GCMS, exploring the analytical parameters to estimate the biases this technique can induce. With this aim, we used the PAMPRE experiment, a capacitively coupled RF cold plasma reactor (Szopa et al. 2006), to synthetize tholins with 2 %, 5 % and 10 % of CH 4 in N 2. The three samples were systematically pyrolyzed in the temperature range 200 - 600 • C with a 100 • C step. The evolved gases were then injected into a GC-MS device for molecular identification. This systematic pyr-GC-MS analysis had two major objectives: (i) optimizing all the analytical parameters for the detection of a wide range of compounds and thus a characterization of the tholins composition as comprehensive as possible, and (ii) highlighting the role of the CH 4 ratio on the tholins molecular structure. About a hundred of molecules have been identified in the pyrolysis products. Although an identical major pattern of nitriles and ethylene appears clearly for the three samples, some discriminant signatures were highlighted. The samples mainly differ by the number of released compounds. The results show especially an increase in the hydrocarbonaceous chains when the CH 4 ratio increases. At the opposite, the formation of poly-nitrogenous compounds seems to be easier for lower CH 4 ratios. We also performed a semi-quantitative study on the best represented chemical family in our chromatograms – namely nitriles: the existence of a relation between the quantity of a released compound and its molecular mass is consistent with the quantification of nitriles in the PAMPRE gas phase done by Gautier et al., 2011. Moreover, numerous species are present both in tholins and in the gas phase. That allowed us to make out potential precursors of the solid organic particles. From all these results, we conclude that the optimal pyrolysis temperature for a GC-MS analysis of our tholins is 600 • C. This temperature choice results from the best compromise between the number of released compounds, the quality of the signal and the appearance of pyrolysis artefacts. Lastly, thanks to a review of pyr-GCMS studies carried out on <b>Titan</b> <b>tholins</b> since the first work of Khare et al.

Titan's aerosol appears to be well mixed between the surface and an altitude of 300 km, with a spectral shape that does not change with latitude or time. The aerosol exhibits an extremely broad emission feature with a spectral peak at 140 cm(exp - 1) (71 micron), which is not evident in laboratory simulated <b>Titan</b> aerosols (<b>tholin).</b> This low- energy aerosol emission feature may arise from low-energy molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and/or nitrogenated aromatics. Unlike the vertically well-mixed aerosol, Titan's condensate clouds are located in highly restricted altitudes in the lower stratosphere, ranging between 60 and 100 km at low and moderate latitudes, to between 150 and 165 km at high northern latitudes during northern winter. Such clouds are located at altitudes where nitrile vapors are expected to condense and appear {{to be dominated by}} HCN and HC 3 N, which are the two most abundant nitriles in Titan's atmosphere. Associated with this ice cloud is a broad emission feature that spectrally peaks near 160 cm(exp - 1) (62. 5 micron). This ice composite appears to chemically change with altitude and latitude, probably as a result of differences in vapor abundance and condensation temperature, and the ice cloud appears to be global in extent. Both CIRS and the Huygens Descent Imager and Spectral Radiometer (DISR) show evidence of cloud layering in Titan's lower stratosphere. The 15 km difference in cloud altitude indicated by the two instruments suggests a difference in ice composition. CIRS also indicates a second ice cloud that exists at isolated latitudes and is consistent with hydrocarbon condensation above the tropopause. This cloud exhibits an emission feature that spectrally peaks near 80 cm(exp - 1) (125 micron), possibly due to C 2 H 6 ice or dominated by an ethane-acetylene composite ice, given that CzH 6 then C 2 H 2 are the two most abundant hydrocarbons next to methane in Titan's atmosphere...|$|R

We apply vacuum deposition and spectroscopic techniques previously used on synthetic organic heteropolymers (tholins), kerogens, and meteoritic organic residues to the measurement of the optical constants of poly-HCN in the wavelength range 0. 05 - 40 micrometers. These measurements allow quantitative comparison with spectrophotometry of organic-rich bodies in the outer solar system. In a specific test of Matthews' hypothesis, poly-HCN fails to match the optical constants of the haze of the Saturnian moon, Titan, in the visible and near-infrared derived from astronomical observations and standard models of the Titan atmosphere. In contrast, a tholin produced from a simulated Titan atmosphere matches within the probable errors. Poly-HCN is much more N-rich than <b>Titan</b> <b>tholin...</b>|$|E
40|$|We have {{obtained}} visible and near infrared spectra of the Trans Neptunian object 2004 DW, {{a few days}} after its discovery, at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). 2004 DW belongs to the plutino dynamical class and has an estimated diameter of about 1600 km, that makes it the largest known object, except Pluto, in the plutino and classical TNO populations. Our data clearly show the 1. 5 and 2 μm bands associated to water ice, while the visible spectrum is nearly neutral and featureless. To interpret the available data we modelled the surface composition of 2004 DW with two different mixtures of organics (<b>Titan</b> <b>tholin</b> and kerogen), amorphous carbon and water ice.

40|$|International audienceAnalogues of Titan's {{aerosols}} are {{of primary}} {{interest in the}} understanding of Titan's atmospheric chemistry and climate, and in the development of in situ instrumentation for future space missions. Numerous studies have been carried out to characterize laboratory analogues of <b>Titan</b> aerosols (<b>tholins),</b> but their molecular composition and structure are still poorly known. If pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (pyr-GCMS) has been used for years to give clues about their chemical composition, highly disparate results were obtained with this technique. They {{can be attributed to the}} variety of analytical conditions used for pyr-GCMS analyses, and/or to differences in the nature of the analogues analyzed, that were produced with different laboratory set-ups under various operating conditions. In order to have a better description of Titan's tholin's molecular composition by pyr-GCMS, we carried out a systematic study with two major objectives: (i) exploring the pyr-GCMS analytical parameters to find the optimal ones for the detection of a wide range of chemical products allowing a characterization of the tholins composition as comprehensive as possible, and (ii) highlighting the role of the CH 4 ratio in the gaseous reactive medium on the tholin's molecular structure. We used a radio-frequency plasma discharge to synthetize tholins with different concentrations of CH 4 diluted in N 2. The samples were pyrolyzed at temperatures covering the 200 – 700 °C range. The extracted gases were then analyzed by GCMS for their molecular identification. The optimal pyrolysis temperature for characterizing the molecular composition of our tholins by GCMS analysis is found to be 600 °C. This temperature choice results from the best compromise between the number of compounds released, the quality of the signal and the appearance of pyrolysis artifacts. About a hundred molecules are identified as pyrolysates. A common major chromatographic pattern appears clearly for all the samples even if the number of released compounds can significantly differ. The hydrocarbon chain content increases in tholins when the CH 4 ratio increases. A semi-quantitative study of the nitriles (most abundant chemical family in our chromatograms) released during the pyrolysis shows the existence of a correlation between the amount of a nitrile released and its molecular mass, similarly to the previous quantification of nitriles in the plasma gas-phase. Moreover, numerous nitriles are present both in tholins and in the gas phase, confirming their suspected role in the gas phase as precursors of the solid organic particles...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the origin of}} the dunes on Titan, it is important to investigate the material properties of Titan's organic sand particles on Titan. The organic sand may behave distinctively compared to the quartz/basaltic sand on terrestrial planets (Earth, Venus, Mars) due to differences in interparticle forces. We measured the surface energy (through contact angle measurements) and elastic modulus (through Atomic Force Microscopy, AFM) of the <b>Titan</b> aerosol analog (<b>tholin).</b> We find the surface energy of a tholin thin film is about 70. 9 mN/m and its elastic modulus is about 3. 0 GPa (similar to hard polymers like PMMA and polystyrene). For two 20 μm diameter particles, the theoretical cohesion force is therefore 3. 3 μN. We directly measured interparticle forces for relevant materials: tholin particles are 0. 8 ± 0. 6 μN, while the interparticle cohesion between walnut shell particles (a typical model materials for the Titan Wind Tunnel, TWT) is only 0. 4 ± 0. 1 μN. The interparticle cohesion forces are much larger for <b>tholins</b> and presumably <b>Titan</b> sand particles than materials used in the TWT. This suggests we should increase the interparticle force in both analog experiments (TWT) and threshold models to correctly translate the results to real Titan conditions. The strong cohesion of tholins may also inform us how the small aerosol particles (∼ 1 μm) in Titan's atmosphere are transformed into large sand particles (∼ 200 μm). It may also support the cohesive sand formation mechanism suggested by Rubin and Hesp (2009), where only unidirectional wind is needed to form linear dunes on Titan. Comment: 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|PAHs are {{important}} {{components of the}} interstellar medium and carbonaceous chondrites, but have never been identified in the reducing atmospheres of the outer solar system. Incompletely characterized complex organic solids (tholins) produced by irradiating simulated Titan atmospheres reproduce well the observed UV/visible/IR optical constants of the Titan stratospheric haze. <b>Titan</b> <b>tholin</b> and a tholin generated in a crude simulation of the atmosphere of Jupiter are examined by two-step laser desorption/multiphoton ionization mass spectrometry. A range of two- to four-ring PAHs, some with one to four alkylation sites, are identified, with a net abundance of about 0. 0001 g/g (grams per gram) of tholins produced. Synchronous fluorescence techniques confirm this detection. Titan tholins have proportionately more one- and two-ring PAHs than do Jupiter tholins, which in turn have more four-ring and larger PAHs. The four-ringed PAH chrysene, prominent in some discussions of interstellar grains, is found in Jupiter tholins...|$|E
