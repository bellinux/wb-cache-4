2500|$|About 18 {{people on}} U.S. {{military}} bases in Kuwait have tested positive for swine flu, a U.S. Central Command spokeswoman said on 24 May 2009. They are the first cases reported in Kuwait. It remains unclear whether the virus has spread to the civilian population. The names and units of <b>the</b> <b>infected</b> <b>people</b> were not immediately available. [...] Maj. Kristi Beckman, speaking from Central Command headquarters in Tampa, said everyone who {{tested positive for the}} virus was quarantined in military health facilities approved by officials from the Kuwaiti Ministry of Health.

60|$|It {{must not}} be omitted that when I speak {{of those people who}} were really thus dangerous, I suppose them to be utterly ignorant of their own conditions; for if they really knew their {{circumstances}} to be such as indeed they were, they must have been a kind of wilful murtherers if they would have gone abroad among healthy people--and it would have verified indeed the suggestion which I mentioned above, and which I thought seemed untrue: viz., that <b>the</b> <b>infected</b> <b>people</b> were utterly careless as to giving the infection to others, and rather forward to do it than not; and I believe it was partly from this very thing that they raised that suggestion, which I hope was not really true in fact.|$|E
60|$|This {{made the}} watchmen be the less regarded, and perhaps occasioned the greater {{violence}} {{to be used}} against them. I mention it on this score to observe that the setting watchmen thus to keep the people in was, first of all, not effectual, but that the people broke out, whether by force or by stratagem, even almost {{as often as they}} pleased; and, second, that those that did thus break out were generally people infected who, in their desperation, running about from one place to another, valued not whom they injured: and which perhaps, as I have said, might give birth to report that it was natural to <b>the</b> <b>infected</b> <b>people</b> to desire to infect others, which report was really false.|$|E
50|$|The story {{starts out}} with {{survivors}} on two buses {{trying to make}} it to a safe zone. The first bus is attacked by <b>the</b> <b>infected.</b> <b>The</b> <b>people</b> in the second bus, including the main characters (Jack, Patrick, Emma and baby Lu) try to escape. While hiding, Emma is attacked by an infected and bitten.|$|R

25|$|In 1971, a far {{different}} version was produced, titled The Omega Man. It starred Charlton Heston (as Robert Neville) and Anthony Zerbe. Matheson had no influence on the screenplay for this film, and although the premise remains, it deviates from the novel in several ways, removing <b>the</b> <b>infected</b> <b>people's</b> vampiric characteristics, except their sensitivity to light. In this version, <b>the</b> <b>infected</b> are portrayed as nocturnal, black-robed, albino mutants, known as The Family. Though intelligent, they eschew modern technology, believing it (and those who use it, such as Neville) to be evil {{and the cause of}} humanity's downfall.|$|R
60|$|And I know it so well, {{and in so}} many several cases, that I {{could give}} several {{relations}} of good, pious, and religious people who, when they have had the distemper, have been so far from being forward to infect others that they have forbid their own family to come near them, in hopes of their being preserved, and have even died without seeing their nearest relations lest they should be instrumental {{to give them the}} distemper, and infect or endanger them. If, then, there were cases wherein <b>the</b> <b>infected</b> <b>people</b> were careless of the injury they did to others, this was certainly one of them, if not the chief, namely, when people who had the distemper had broken out from houses which were so shut up, and having been driven to extremities for provision or for entertainment, had endeavoured to conceal their condition, and have been thereby instrumental involuntarily to infect others who have been ignorant and unwary.|$|E
60|$|And this is {{the reason}} why it is {{impossible}} in a visitation to prevent the spreading of the plague by the utmost human vigilance: viz., {{that it is impossible to}} know <b>the</b> <b>infected</b> <b>people</b> from the sound, or that <b>the</b> <b>infected</b> <b>people</b> should perfectly know themselves. I knew a man who conversed freely in London all the season of the plague in 1665, and kept about him an antidote or cordial on purpose to take when he thought himself in any danger, and he had such a rule to know or have warning of the danger by as indeed I never met with before or since. How far it may be depended on I know not. He had a wound in his leg, and whenever he came among any people that were not sound, and the infection began to affect him, he said he could know it by that signal, viz., that his wound in his leg would smart, and look pale and white; so as soon as ever he felt it smart it was time for him to withdraw, or to take care of himself, taking his drink, which he always carried about him for that purpose. Now it seems he found his wound would smart many times when he was in company with such who thought themselves to be sound, and who appeared so to one another; but he would presently rise up and say publicly, 'Friends, here is somebody in the room that has the plague', and so would immediately break up the company. This was indeed a faithful monitor to all people that the plague is not to be avoided by those that converse promiscuously in a town infected, and people have it when they know it not, and that they likewise give it to others when they know not that they have it themselves; and in this case shutting up the well or removing the sick will not do it, unless they can go back and shut up all those that the sick had conversed with, even before they knew themselves to be sick, and none knows how far to carry that back, or where to stop; for none knows when or where or how they may have received the infection, or from whom.|$|E
50|$|The third superstition is that leprosy is {{a vicious}} infection. This disease has been present {{from the early}} times of Japanese history, but <b>the</b> <b>infected</b> <b>people</b> have been so minimal, {{revealing}} that its infectivity is very mild.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, General Murchison {{meets with}} several {{military}} officers and scientists at a hidden command bunker where they determine the attackers are contaminated humans whose skin and blood tissues have been mutated by radiation. They {{speculate that the}} scientist investigating the leak at the state nuclear power plant was apparently infected with high doses of radiation and that he <b>infected</b> others aboard <b>the</b> military transport plane leading to <b>the</b> outbreak. <b>The</b> <b>infected</b> <b>peoples</b> bodies, while capable of feats of strength, speed and reflexes beyond those of most humans, are unable to regenerate red blood cells, hence their appetite for blood. The only way that <b>the</b> <b>infected</b> can by killed is by destroying their programed brains by shooting them in their heads.|$|R
50|$|Due to <b>the</b> {{migration}} of <b>infected</b> <b>people</b> from Surat city, suspected plague spread to five states. A total of around 52 deaths were reported from India {{due to this}} suspected plague outbreak.|$|R
5000|$|Seven {{new cases}} were {{confirmed}} on 26 June. Two of <b>the</b> <b>infected</b> <b>people</b> {{came back from}} a trip to Mexico. The others were American students who were on a trip to Estonia with the U.S. Student Ambassador program, [...] "People to People".|$|E
50|$|The {{first known}} {{transmission}} of H5N1 {{to a human}} occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, when there was an outbreak of 18 human cases; 6 deaths were confirmed. None of <b>the</b> <b>infected</b> <b>people</b> worked with poultry. After culling all of the poultry in the area, no more cases were diagnosed. In 2006, the first human-to-human transmission likely occurred when 7 members of a family in Sumatra became infected after contact with a family member {{who had worked with}} infected poultry.|$|E
50|$|The expert said at {{the time}} that due to the region's remoteness, the disease killed more than half <b>the</b> <b>infected</b> <b>people.</b> The report also said that since the 1990s, there was a rise in plague cases in humans—from fewer than 10 in the 1980s to nearly 100 cases in 1996 and 254 in 2000. Official {{statistics}} posted on the Chinese Health Ministry's Web site showed no cases of plague in 2007 and 2008. In September 2008, two people in east Tibet died of pneumonic plague.|$|E

25|$|Electron microscopy, enzyme-immunoassay (ELISA), immunofluorescence, and {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} have all been used for detecting virus particle, antigens or viral nucleic acid in <b>the</b> stools of <b>infected</b> <b>people.</b> A method using real-time RT-PCR, which can detect all human astrovirus genotypes, has been reported.|$|R
50|$|Prevention is by {{not having}} sex, the use of condoms, or having sex with only one other person, who is not infected. Chlamydia can be cured by {{antibiotics}} with typically either azithromycin or doxycycline being used. Erythromycin or azithromycin is recommended in babies and during pregnancy. Sexual partners should also be treated and <b>the</b> <b>infected</b> <b>people</b> advised not to have sex for seven days and until symptom free. Gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV should be tested for in {{those who have been}} infected. Following treatment people should be tested again after three months.|$|E
50|$|The next day, Miller and Anna {{get out of}} {{the city}} and stop at a local filling station for fuel only to be {{attacked}} by a small group of infected at the area. Miller manages to make a Molotov cocktail and blows up the ambulance along with <b>the</b> <b>infected</b> <b>people</b> that have overrun it. Miller and Anna travel on foot and try to evade hordes of infected zombies now roaming the countryside. They take shelter in a local church, only to find the priest infected which Miller is forced to kill him.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an algorithm for syndromic surveillance of an epidemic outbreak formulated {{in the context}} of stochastic nonlinear filtering.
