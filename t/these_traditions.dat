5|$|Israel’s culinary traditions {{comprise}} {{foods and}} cooking methods that span three {{thousand years of}} history. Over that time, <b>these</b> <b>traditions</b> have been shaped by influences from Asia, Africa and Europe, and religious and ethnic influences {{have resulted in a}} culinary melting pot. Biblical and archaeological records provide insight into the culinary life of the region as far back as 968 BCE, {{in the days of the}} kings of ancient Israel.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian {{building}} traditions. While {{it may be}} {{too much}} to speak of a renaissance in traditional Norwegian architecture, more and more urban planning is affected by the need to preserve or restore <b>these</b> <b>traditions.</b> Examples include plans to renew the center of Oppdal and recent work at the Oslo neighborhood of Grünerløkka.|$|E
5|$|Hyderabad has {{continued}} with <b>these</b> <b>traditions</b> in its annual Hyderabad Literary Festival, held since 2010, showcasing the city's literary and cultural creativity. Organisations {{engaged in the}} advancement of literature include the Sahitya Akademi, the Urdu Academy, the Telugu Academy, the National Council for Promotion of Urdu Language, the Comparative Literature Association of India, and the Andhra Saraswata Parishad. Literary development is further aided by state {{institutions such as the}} State Central Library, the largest public library in the state which was established in 1891, and other major libraries including the Sri Krishna Devaraya Andhra Bhasha Nilayam, the British Library and the Sundarayya Vignana Kendram.|$|E

50|$|It is very unfortunate, {{that most}} of <b>these</b> <b>tradition</b> has almost all {{disappeared}} due to coming of more global and uniformed culture. Kethoprak, Kentrung, Angguk, Barongan and Reyog were {{used to be the}} expressions of thanks of the people during the wedding or other important ceremonies. Now they have been replaced either by video-movies, or by Dangdut concerts.|$|R
50|$|This festival {{had brought}} every year without fail until 2009, when he {{declared}} influenza pandemic AH1N1 when Zacatecas state authorities prohibit {{the making of}} any party bosses.

5|$|Regarded as a {{major event}} in British culture, the festival is {{inspired}} by the ethos of the hippie, counterculture, and free festival movements. It retains vestiges of <b>these</b> <b>traditions,</b> such as the Green Fields area, which includes sections known as the Green Futures and Healing Fields. After the 1970s, the festival took place almost every year and grew in size, {{with the number of}} attendees sometimes being swollen by gatecrashers. Michael Eavis hosted the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open-air Led Zeppelin concert at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} that oral traditions in general and poetry in particular was well placed to {{play a part in}} cultural resistance to apartheid. Music and poetry were more accessible to a large number of South Africans than written material (partly due to the restrictions placed by apartheid). Music, poetry, and storytelling also formed part of the everyday life of a number of South Africans, and protest songs emerged from <b>these</b> <b>traditions.</b> In addition, poetry was traditionally seen by some South Africans as a legitimate means of criticising authority, with poetic licence allowing artists to say things that would otherwise not be acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Some medieval rabbis {{claimed that}} today's Western Wall is a {{surviving}} {{wall of the}} Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts {{in a state of}} impurity. Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness. Most secular scholars believe however that <b>these</b> <b>traditions</b> originally pertained to a western wall of the Temple itself, and since the 1500s, were gradually applied to the surviving retaining Western Wall of the Mount.|$|E

5|$|The early {{eighteenth century}} {{was also a}} period of {{innovation}} in Gaelic vernacular poetry. Major figures included Rob Donn Mackay (1714–78) and Donnchadh Bàn Mac an t-Saoir (Duncan Ban MacIntyre) (1724–1812). The most significant figure in the tradition was Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (Alasdair MacDonald) (c. 1698–1770). His interest in traditional forms {{can be seen in}} his most significant poem Clanranald's Gallery. He also mixed <b>these</b> <b>traditions</b> with influences from the Lowlands, including Thompson's Seasons, which helped inspire a new form of nature poetry in Gaelic, which was not focused on their relations to human concerns.|$|E
5|$|Various folk traditions across Europe are analyzed, {{such as the}} Alpine Perchtenlaufen, {{where women}} broke social {{conventions}} by attacking men or engaging in lesbianism. Duerr compares <b>these</b> <b>traditions</b> to the benandanti of early modern Friuli, and to the Livonian werewolf, viewing them as representing the clash between order and chaos. Christian society in the Late Middle Ages began to construe the witch as a creature inside of society rather than outside it, which partly led to the witch trials of the early modern period. Duerr argues that the societies of European Christendom began to increasingly accept female nudity in art and fashion during the Late Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} {{discipline of}} sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic {{as a result}} of the contentions of classical social theory. In Randall Collins' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural (Simmel) and pragmatist (Mead, Cooley) theories of social interaction. Utilitarianism, also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with economics, is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by Raewyn Connell, a tradition that is often forgotten is that of Social Darwinism, which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily Herbert Spencer, Lester F. Ward and William Graham Sumner. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of <b>these</b> <b>traditions</b> and they are by no means mutually exclusive.|$|E

2500|$|In Southern Africa {{one finds}} ancient and {{widespread}} traditions of building in stone. Two broad categories of <b>these</b> <b>tradition</b> have been noted: 1. Zimbabwean style 2. Transvaal Free State style. North of the Zambezi one finds very few stone ruins.

25|$|Traditionally, {{the parents}} would often name their child after an older relative, so that his/her name would {{live on in}} the family. Today, however, these are not binding {{conditions}} and are often ignored: parents often pick a name without conforming with <b>these</b> <b>traditions,</b> however it is really up to the parents as still many of them continue to observe <b>these</b> <b>traditions.</b> Traditions to name a child after the parents' best man or maid of honor or the saint on whose name day the child is born also exist.|$|E

25|$|Many other {{cultures}} {{around the world}} have similar traditions of a day set aside to visit the graves of deceased family members. Often included in <b>these</b> <b>traditions</b> are celebrations, food, and beverages, in addition to prayers and remembrances of the departed.|$|E
25|$|All three Abrahamic {{religions}} {{were founded}} by men, so some scholars and psychologists have theorized {{that they may}} dramatize important themes around men's relationship with their fathers for the western world. Conversely, conservative theologians within <b>these</b> <b>traditions,</b> especially Christianity, see fatherhood itself modeled on God the Father.|$|E

50|$|Lykourgos had {{especially}} influenced Georgios Konstantinou, who {{proposed a}} notation for microtonal shifts (melodic attraction) and notated details, which {{had previously been}} part of oral tradition. The advantage of the oral tradition is that only those singers who had been introduced by their masters, followed a certain local tradition. The Balkans and the Orient are still rich of <b>these</b> local <b>traditions.</b> Lykourgos Angelopoulos was well known for his international collaborations, e.g. with Divna Ljubojević, and as a charismatic singer who had a large following. He had faced strong opposition among psaltes who belong to <b>these</b> local <b>traditions.</b>|$|R
