5|$|After the {{establishment}} of independent Czechoslovakia in 1918, the country kept the gun law of 1852 (see above), i.e. the citizens {{had the right to}} possess firearms and needed to obtain a permit {{in order to be able}} <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|No carry: Holders of A license (collection purposes) {{may only}} obtain and possess {{firearms}} (also those {{falling into the}} A – restricted guns category, subject to being granted a may-issue permit) and are not allowed <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>them</b> or shoot with them.|$|E
5|$|Dreadnoughts {{also carried}} lighter weapons. Many early dreadnoughts carried a {{secondary}} armament of very light guns designed {{to fend off}} enemy torpedo boats. The calibre and weight of secondary armament tended to increase, as the range of torpedoes and the staying power of the destroyers expected <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>them</b> also increased. From the end of World War I onwards, battleships had to be equipped with many light guns as anti-aircraft armament.|$|E

6000|$|Rousing himself, Clennam {{observed}} that the prison had awakened from its noontide doze, that the inmates were loitering about the shady yard, {{and that it was}} late in the afternoon. He had been thinking for hours. 'Your things is come,' said Mr Chivery, 'and my son is going <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>'em</b> up. I should have sent 'em up but for his wishing <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>'em</b> himself. Indeed he would have 'em himself, and so I couldn't send 'em up.

5|$|The Special Operations Executive were {{approached}} {{to see if}} its agents could destroy the dock gates. They decided that the mission was beyond their capabilities because the weight of explosives required would have needed too many agents <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>them.</b> The Royal Navy was also unable to mount an operation, as St Nazaire is 8km (5 miles) up the Loire estuary. Any naval ships large enough to cause sufficient damage would be detected well before they were within range.|$|E
5|$|As Strike Back is a {{military}} drama, the production crew used a vast catalogue of firearms, including side arms, assault and sniper rifles, as well as rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and other explosives. Cast members were first taught by carrying weights that mimicked {{the weight of the}} weapons so they could get used to carrying it during filming. Later, they were taught how <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>them</b> professionally, including how to disassemble and re-assemble them, as well as how to fire and reload. Though the majority were actually rubber, duplicates were sometimes used for some of the background characters. Three ex-SAS soldiers gave the cast weapons and tactical training, and were also on hand to oversee how cast members carried the weapons during filming sessions.|$|E
5|$|Investigation of shipwrecks in {{vicinity}} of Pedra Branca. Singapore had duties to investigate hazards to navigational safety and to publish information about such hazards in its capacity as a lighthouse operator, {{and under the}} United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea. Therefore, by investigating and reporting on shipwrecks and maritime hazards within Pedra Branca's territorial waters Singapore had acted in accordance with best practice and not à titre de souverain. The circumstances of the particular investigations also meant that Singapore's ability <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>them</b> out was not based on its sovereignty over the island.|$|E

5|$|Rapid forces, {{whether for}} an {{offensive}} or defensive purpose, {{were needed to}} deny vital locations to the enemy. Long before the Germans did, the French had contemplated using airborne troops to achieve speedy attacks. As early as 1936 the French had commissioned the design of light airborne tanks, but these plans had been abandoned in 1940, as they possessed no cargo planes large enough <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>them.</b> A naval division and an infantry division were earmarked to depart for Zealand to block the Western Scheldt against a German crossing. These would send forward forces over the Scheldt estuary into the Isles, supplied by overseas shipping.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the US Navy {{sought to}} acquire a nuclear strike capability, and the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air, Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford wanted them to operate from {{aircraft}} carriers. There were practical problems with this. Nuclear weapons at that time were bulky and required a large aircraft <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>them.</b> After Operation Crossroads, Radford asked Hayward if the Navy had such an aircraft, and Hayward suggested modifying the Lockheed P2V Neptune for carrier operations using jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) rocket boosters. It was an interim solution, as it a could not carry a Fat Man, but only the smaller Little Boy bomb; {{it could only be}} operated by the large Midway class aircraft carriers, which still had to be modified for the task; and initially had no tailhook, so it was unable to land on a carrier, and a mission would have to end with it either landing at a land base or ditching at sea.|$|E
5|$|An added {{difficulty}} for Killigrew {{and his sons}} Thomas and Charles was the political unrest of 1678–1684 with the Popish Plot and the Exclusion Bill crisis distracting potential audiences from things theatrical. This affected both the King's and the Duke's companies, {{but most of all}} the King's which had no profit margin <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>them</b> through the lean years. In 1682, the companies merged, or rather, the King's was absorbed by the Duke's. Led at the time by Thomas Betterton, the United Company, as it was now called, chose Drury Lane as their production house, leaving the Duke's Company's theatre in Dorset Garden closed for a time. In 1688 Betterton was removed from managerial control by Alexander Davenant, son of William Davenant, the original patent holder for the Duke's Company. Davenant's management (with Charles Killigrew) proved brief and disastrous, and by 1693 he was fleeing to the Canary Islands in the wake of embezzlement charges. The Theatre Royal found itself in the hands of lawyer Christopher Rich for the next 16 years.|$|E

5|$|New {{state laws}} prohibiting fast food {{restaurants}} in low-income neighborhoods {{result in the}} closure of all KFC eateries in Colorado, much {{to the dismay of}} Cartman, who is addicted to the food. When Randy Marsh learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical marijuana dispensary, he attempts to give himself cancer so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By irradiating his groin with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself testicular cancer, making his testicles so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>them.</b> Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to the point that he uses them as a space hopper for movement. Randy finds that larger testicles are attractive to women, including his wife, Sharon Marsh, so he encourages his friends to also get testicular cancer. The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes convinced that a recent change in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} {{scene in the}} aftermath of the Partition Sejm saw the rise of a conservative faction which was opposed to the Permanent Council, seeing it as a threat to their Golden Freedoms. This faction was supported by the Czartoryski family, but not by Poniatowski, who proved to be quite adept at making the Council follow his wishes; this marked the formation of new anti-royal and pro-royal factions in Polish politics. The royal faction was made up primarily of people indebted to the king, who planned to build their careers on service to him; few were privy to his plans for reforms, which were kept hidden from the conservative opposition and Russia. Poniatowski scored a political victory during the Sejm of 1776, which further strengthened the Council. Chancellor Andrzej Zamoyski was tasked with the codification of the Polish law, a project that became known as the Zamoyski Code. Russia supported some, but not all, of the 1776 reforms, and to prevent Poniatowski from growing too powerful, it supported the opposition during the Sejm of 1778. This marked the end of Poniatowski's reforms, as he found himself without sufficient support <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>them</b> through.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Germany, Emden {{was assigned to}} training duties once again. She continued in this role until June 1942, by which time a major overhaul was in order. The refit was completed in Wilhelmshaven, after which Emden returned to training cadets. In September 1944, she was deployed to Norway, where she served as the flagship of the minelaying forces there. While in Norway, she participated in several minelaying operations through October, when she was transferred to convoy escort duty; her primary task was to protect convoys {{in and out of}} Oslo. This lasted until December, when she ran aground in the Oslofjord off the island of Flateguri. Her guns were removed while repairs were partially effected in the Schichau-Werke. Before departing East Prussia, she took on the remains of Paul von Hindenburg and his wife <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>them</b> to mainland Germany. They had been disinterred to prevent them from falling {{into the hands of the}} advancing Soviet Army. The repair work on the ship was not yet completed, and so she was towed to Pillau, where the Hindenburgs' remains were taken off. Emdens engines were put back in working order, though she was incapable of reaching top speed, and her guns were reinstalled.|$|E

5000|$|On September 24, 1942, Zeitzler was {{promoted}} to General der Infanterie ("General of the Infantry") and simultaneously appointed Chief of the OKH General Staff, replacing Franz Halder. Hitler had been impressed by Zeitzler's optimistic and vigorous reports, and chose him over several higher-ranked and more senior officers. Albert Speer states Hitler wanted a reliable assistant who [...] "doesn't go off and brood on my orders, but energetically sees <b>to</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>them</b> out." ...|$|R

5|$|At {{the onset}} of war in Korea, No.77 Squadron was self-supporting, the largest flying unit in the RAAF. It {{comprised}} 299 officers and men, 40 Mustangs, 3 CAC Wirraways, 2 Douglas C-47 Dakotas and 2 Austers. The added burden of combat operations made this situation untenable after the squadron went into action in Korea, leading {{to the formation of}} No.391 (Base) Squadron at Iwakuni, {{at the same time as}} No.91 Wing headquarters. RAAF base squadrons were responsible for administrative, logistical, medical, communications and security functions. Staffed mainly by former No.77 Squadron members, in the first year of its existence No.391 Squadron had to try to overcome severe shortages of winter clothing and equipment. Further problems arose when No.77 Squadron converted to Gloster Meteors between April and July 1951, as spares for the British-made jet were harder to obtain than for the American Mustang. No longer could No.391 Squadron source parts from the US Fifth Air Force as it had up till this point. Disposal of the Mustangs and their spares also caused headaches; the process took two years, causing storage issues. The base squadron faced another challenge in January 1952, following a controversial change in role for the Meteors, from air-to-air combat to ground attack, which necessitated obtaining supplies of rockets and modification of the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
