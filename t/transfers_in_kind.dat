40|$|The catalytical {{role of the}} hydroxy {{amino acid}} in the "marker sequence" Asn-Xaa-Thr(Ser) for the N-glycosylation step of {{glycoprotein}} formation was investigated by using a series of hexapeptides derived from Tyr-Asn-Gly-Xaa-Ser-Val by substituting threonine, serine, cysteine, valine and O-methylthreonine respectively for Xaa. The results, which were obtained with calf liver microsomal fractions as enzyme source and dolichyl diphosphate di-N-acetyl [14 C] chitobiose as glycosyl donor showed that the threonine-, serine- and cysteine-containing derivatives could be glycosylated, although at very different rates, whereas the valine and O-methylthreonine analogues did not work as glycosyl acceptors. Replacement of threonine by serine resulted in a 4 -fold decrease in Vmax, and about a 10 -fold increase in Km for glycosyl transfer. Replacement of serine by cysteine again decreased acceptor activity 2 - 3 -fold. The various results, taken together, indicate an absolute requirement for a hydrogen-bond-donor function in the side chain of the hydroxy amino acid of the "marker sequence" and furthermore, point to a considerable influence {{of the structure of}} this amino acid on binding {{as well as on the}} glycosyl <b>transfer</b> itself. <b>In</b> order to explain the observed differences in the glycosyl-transfer rates, a model is proposed with a hydrogen-bond interaction between the amide of asparagine as the hydrogen-bond donor and the oxygen of the hydroxy group of the hydroxy amino acid as the hydrogen-bond acceptor.

30|$|To {{characterize}} the {{cyclically-adjusted budget deficit}} reduction, the model considers a single instrument on the revenue side, the tax burden, and three instruments on the expenditure side: final consumption, social <b>transfers</b> other than <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> and gross capital formation, as in European-Commission (2009). Figure  3 exhibits accordingly the cyclically-adjusted actual evolution {{of each of the}} four fiscal instruments. Spending was adjusted for the cyclical component by applying the elasticity of total expenditure (excluding interest rate) relative to the cycle to all items. Similarly, for the tax burden, we used the total government revenue elasticity. Elasticities were calculated from the AMECO Database series. During the whole consolidation process, we can see a decrease <b>in</b> social <b>transfers,</b> along with a slight increase in public investment. On the other side, the tax burden increased especially during the second-half part of the adjustment. Table  2 summarizes the initial (1996) and final (2007) values (% GDP) for each of the cyclically-adjusted primary deficit components and for the debt-to-output ratio.|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of observational projects for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) we obtained UV spectra of totally seven Wolf-Rayet stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The present research projects was dedicated to the analyses of those spectra. The model atmospheres which are required for that purpose, accounting for the radiation <b>transfer</b> <b>in</b> such <b>kind</b> of expanding stellar atmospheres, have been decisively improved (implementation of the so-called iron line blanketing). The more general unsettled questions concern {{the role of the}} WR stars in the scenario of stellar evolution, and the driving mechanism of these strong stellar winds. Summarizing, we performed the following steps successively: The seven WC stars in the LMC, for which we obtained HST data, have been analyzed quantitatively, and conclusions concerning stellar evolution have been drawn. The model atmospheres were considerably improved by the inclusion of iron line blanketing and now can reproduce the observed spectra much better. The radiative acceleration obtained by the model calculations is almost sufficient to account for the acceleration of the observed stellar winds, thus suggesting that WR winds are basically driven by radiation pressure.

40|$|L 1 {{transfer}} is {{generally regarded as}} an important characteristic of L 2 acquisition, {{also one of the}} sources of learners’ errors. One of the primary transfer between English and Chinese lies in the verb usage since verbs that are transitive in Chinese may be intransitive in English, or vice versa. In the previous studies, the investigation on the syntactic <b>transfer</b> <b>in</b> verb transitivity is only one part of the research focus and not all kinds of verb transitivity are put into analysis. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to investigate the nature of syntactic <b>transfer</b> <b>in</b> all <b>kinds</b> of verb transitivity from the interlanguage of Taiwanese EFL college students. The subjects were 56 juniors. The instruments included a demographic questionnaire, a translation test with prompts, and a retrospective report. The demographic questionnaire was used to understand the subjects’ personal learning background. The test measured four verb transitivities: complete verb transitivity, incomplete verb transitivity, complete verb intransitivity, and incomplete verb intransitivity. Test takers translated sentences from Chinese into English by using the prompts. When translating, they had to first mark their familiarity with the verb usage in order to explore the extent to which they employed syntactic knowledge or the guessing skills. Finally, each subject wrote a retrospective report to reflect the possible reasons why they made mistakes in the items whose translations resembled Chinese structures. The difficulty and familiarity level of each item and the percentages of using incorrect verb transitivity were calculated and analyzed. The results showed that the extent of syntactic <b>transfer</b> <b>in</b> verb transitivity is not as large as the previous studies. However, both negative and positive <b>transfers</b> were found <b>in</b> the learners’ interlanguage. It is interesting to note that for the verbs which the learners were confident with, they were not even aware that they made errors.
