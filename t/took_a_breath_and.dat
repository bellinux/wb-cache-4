500|$|Gaga first {{performed}} an acoustic-jazz {{version of the}} song at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria in May 15, 2011. During the song, she revealed that her record company had told her to keep new material to a minimum, {{but she said she}} wanted to air the track in full. Another piano version of the song was performed on May 21, 2011, on the season finale of Saturday Night Live, where Gaga wore a metallic black dress, knee-high boots and a semi-circular metallic headdress. The full version was first performed at the final show of American Idol season 10 on May 25, 2011, where she was joined by Clemons in person. Gaga appeared perched atop a mountain top on the [...] "Idol" [...] stage, dressed in a long cape and a bedazzled headpiece. A trio of dancers were {{at the base of the}} set performing choreographed dance steps while Gaga sang from the top. At the end of the performance, Gaga and a dancer embraced each other, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> then jumped off the edge of the stage, landing out of sight on a bed of fake rocks, as steam shot up high in the air. Len Melisurgo from The Star-Ledger felt that the performance was too [...] "sexually suggestive" [...] for the audience of American Idol and wondered whether Gaga [...] "went just a little too far for a family-oriented show that's geared toward a younger audience?" [...] Conversely, Adam Graham from MTV News listed it as one of Gaga's most memorable television performances. Monica Herrera from Billboard listed it as the fourth best performance of the night, and felt that Gaga [...] "channeled Bruce Springsteen" [...] in her personality.|$|E

When we saw you fall we just drew back, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> then shut our mouths, {{and went down}} for you {{just the same as}} if we'd been a groping for you under water. We got hold of you both, lifted you up, and carried you along as far as we could before we drew a breath again. You're sharp, Jack, but you don't know {{everything}} yet." [...] And Bill Haden chuckled to find that for once his practical experience taught him something that Jack had not learned from his books.|$|E

Of course, the stream took me up a long way. I only came up once, on my back, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> went down again, and the second time I was right under the bank and well out of sight, though I could hear them talking above me. It was just when I looked round, then, that I saw them throwing stones and firing {{into the middle of the}} river, two hundred yards lower down, and after that I had only to keep on swimming under water, close to the bank." ...|$|E

50|$|One {{objection}} {{that can}} be offered against Van Inwagen’s view is the vagueness of the category {{of life and the}} ambiguity of when something gets “caught up” in a life. For example, if <b>a</b> cat <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> inhales <b>a</b> carbon atom, it is unclear at what point that atom becomes officially incorporated into the cat’s body.|$|R
50|$|The defense {{pathologist}} {{testified that}} the 23- or 24-week fetus was stillborn, with lungs insufficiently developed to breathe, while the prosecution pathologist {{testified that the}} fetus was at 25 to 30 weeks and was born alive. The prosecutors used a widely discredited lung float test {{to determine whether the}} fetus took a breath after birth. The procedure tests the buoyancy of the lungs in the belief that lungs that float suggest that the fetus <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> the lungs in this case did float. Forensic experts discredit the use of such a test in criminal proceedings {{because of the number of}} false positives on record. The jury in Patel's case determined the fetus had been alive and found Patel guilty of child neglect.|$|E
5000|$|Bradley's command {{took the}} initial brunt {{of what would}} become the Battle of the Bulge. For {{logistical}} and command reasons, General Eisenhower decided to place Bradley's First and Ninth Armies under the temporary command of Field Marshal Montgomery's 21st Army Group on the northern flank of the Bulge. Bradley was incensed, and began shouting at Eisenhower: [...] "By God, Ike, I cannot be responsible to the American people if you do this. I resign." [...] Eisenhower turned red, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> replied evenly [...] "Brad, I—not you—am responsible to the American people. Your resignation therefore means absolutely nothing." [...] Bradley paused, made one more protest, then fell silent as Eisenhower concluded [...] "Well, Brad, those are my orders." [...] At least one historian has attributed Eisenhower's support for Bradley's subsequent promotion to (temporary) four-star general (March 1945, not made permanent until January 1949) to, in part, a desire to compensate him for the way in which he had been sidelined during the Battle of the Bulge. [...] Others point out that both Secretary of War Stimson and General Eisenhower had desired to reward General Patton with a fourth star for his string of accomplishments in 1944, but that Eisenhower could not promote Patton over Bradley, Devers, and other senior commanders without upsetting the chain of command (as Bradley commanded these people in the theater).|$|E

The client is asked to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> then initiate the movement of swallowing, followed by forcefully saying “boom”.

50|$|After drawing {{attention}} to the capsize by banging {{on the bottom of}} their boat, the kayaker who capsized waits upside down underwater until another kayak arrives to help. The capsized kayaker finds the other kayak, usually the bow, with their hand and uses this for support while they <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> perform <b>a</b> hip-flick to right their kayak. If the kayaker runs out of breath before managing to complete the eskimo rescue, as sometimes happens, they will exit their kayak by releasing their spray deck.|$|R

His wife is a descendant of Sarah Wildes, one of the condemned witches who was hanged in 1692. He {{took the opportunity to}} urge caution on a similar reaction to the then-recent September 11 attacks, stating, [...] "Sometimes when things like this happen we need to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> look at it.

Ought we be concerned that our rights to protest are being continually eroded {{under the guise of}} enhancing our safety? ... When you <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> look away from the spectacle it's amazing how absurd it seems when you look back.|$|R

5000|$|Digital Spy was {{hesitant}} in its review, {{praising the}} cast for their performances but felt {{the script and}} pacing needed to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> explore ideas in more depth, with Morgan Jeffery writing [...] "A fast pace is {{all well and good}} - in fact, it's essential to hold on to a younger audience - but at times, 'For Tonight, We Might Die' is racing so much that it trips itself up". Summarising the programme so far: [...] "Class is a bit like a hormonal teen - all over the place, with quite literal moodswings. But also like a teen, it's finding itself." ...|$|R

500|$|The Deluxe Complete Edition soundtrack was {{released}} on December 18, 2007. Depp's singing was described by a New York Times reviewer as [...] "harsh and thin, but amazingly forceful". Another critic adds that, though Depp's voice [...] "does not have much heft or power", [...] "his ear is obviously excellent, because his pitch is dead-on accurate... Beyond his good pitch and phrasing, the expressive colorings of his singing are crucial to the portrayal. Beneath this Sweeney’s vacant, sullen exterior is a man consumed with a murderous rage that threatens to burst forth every time he slowly <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> is poised to speak. Yet when he sings, his voice crackles and breaks with sadness." ...|$|R
50|$|Mark Visser {{has several}} {{specialised}} trainers who have developed programs {{for water and}} land consisting of exercises specific {{to the demands of}} big wave surfing. These exercises include training his body to cope potentially dangerous situations, such as extended periods of submersion without oxygen which has created interest from the U.S. Navy SEALs. Before submerging Mark does not <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> after expelling all the air in his lungs, he can sink {{to the bottom of the}} pool and wait for 1 minute and 30 seconds before swimming the length of a 50-meter Olympic swimming pool underwater (view training drill http://www.markvisser.net/videos/22). Visser can also hold his breath underwater for 6 minutes and 4 seconds.|$|R

5000|$|Precious Images {{features}} half-second-long splices {{from approximately}} 470 American films. Chuck Workman described the film's editing structure as [...] "a sprint. You <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> you go."“Of course, I {{had so many}} movies I wanted to include that the time constraint forced me to compress the film more and more. The cutting got faster and faster, but I realized that the film was still working. And I was moving things around, {{and it was still}} working. I started finding these wonderful little combinations of shots, the kind of edits that I’d been doing for years in other things, but suddenly in this film I wasn’t selling anything. It was a wonderful moment for me.” ...|$|R
