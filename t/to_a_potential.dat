5|$|Ions in ionic {{compounds}} {{are primarily}} {{held together by}} the electrostatic forces between the charge distribution of these bodies, {{and in particular the}} ionic bond resulting from the long-ranged Coulomb attraction between the net negative charge of the anions and net positive charge of the cations. There is also a small additional attractive force from van der Waals interactions which contributes only around 1–2% of the cohesive energy for small ions. When a pair of ions comes close enough for their outer electron shells (most simple ions have closed shells) to overlap, a short-ranged repulsive force occurs, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The balance between these forces leads <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> energy well with a minimum energy when the nuclei are separated by a specific equilibrium distance.|$|E
5|$|Sing's {{reputation}} {{resulted in}} a champion Turkish sniper, nicknamed 'Abdul the Terrible' by the Allied side, being assigned to deal with him. Tate alleges that the Turks were largely able to distinguish Sing's sniping from that of other ANZAC soldiers, and that only the reports of incidents believed to be Sing's work were passed on to Abdul. Through analysis of the victims' actions and wounds, Abdul concluded that Sing's position was at Chatham's Post. After several days, Sing's spotter alerted him <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> target, and he took aim, {{only to find the}} target—Abdul—looking in his direction. Sing prepared to fire, trying not to reveal his position, but the Turkish sniper noticed him and began his own firing sequence. Sing fired first and killed Abdul. Very shortly thereafter, the Turkish artillery fired on Sing's position—he and his spotter barely managed to evacuate from Chatham's Post alive.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, the Solar System {{is stable}} in {{that none of}} the planets are likely to collide with each other or be ejected from the system in the next few billion years. Beyond this, within fivebillion years or so Mars's {{eccentricity}} may grow to around 0.2, such that it lies on an Earth-crossing orbit, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> collision. In the same timescale, Mercury's eccentricity may grow even further, and a close encounter with Venus could theoretically eject it from the Solar System altogether or send it {{on a collision course with}} Venus or Earth. This could happen within a billion years, according to numerical simulations in which Mercury's orbit is perturbed.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{ran into}} trouble with Lawrence's harsh {{frugality}} while working on his cyclotron and was fired twice from the Radiation Laboratory.

He was later rehired at Luis Alvarez's urging, but melted an expensive pair of pliers while welding, and was fired again.

Performances promoting California began on May 14, 2016 with the group's surprise appearance at KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California. Prior {{to the main}} headlining tour, the group embarked on the We Are Pirates Tour, performing at several festivals and amphitheaters between May and July 2016. The festivals included X Games Austin 2016, Firefly Music Festival, Big Field Day, Amnesia Rockfest, and Kerfuffle 2016. Hoppus and Skiba also performed several acoustic sets in England in June 2016. The main tour behind California began on July 21 in San Diego and its North American leg concluded on October 7 in Irvine. The trek was supported by A Day to Remember, {{as well as the}} All-American Rejects, All Time Low, and DJ Spider. Afterwards, the group again performed acoustic sets in the U.K., and also performed at various festivals and events, including Not So Silent Night, Holiday Havoc, Wrex the Halls, and KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas. The band also played the AT Developer Summit and the Phoenix Open in early 2017.|$|E
