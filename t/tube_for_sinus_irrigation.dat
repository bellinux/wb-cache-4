Naegleria fowleri in unboiled or otherwise unsterilized water can cause the brain infection primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), which carries a 95% risk of fatality.|$|R
30|$|In many cases, obtaining an endosope is {{expensive}} {{and it seems}} impractical investing just {{for the use of}} such complications. Our technique provides office-based surgery and irrigation with minimal discomfort for the patient. When this procedure is compared with the treatment of other maxillary sinusitis such as Caldwell-Luc surgery, ESS, it has some advantages such as lower complication rates, less blood loss and operation time, and lower cost. Also, because the surgical procedure is not complicated, local clinics have an advantage in that it can be used under local anesthesia without difficulty. But, unlike other treatments, it is a blind technique that irrigation must be performed sufficiently with accurate anatomical knowledge of the maxillary sinus. This method is a patient friendly technique <b>for</b> <b>sinus</b> <b>irrigation</b> and highly recommended.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Lysozyme is {{an innate}} immune peptide with {{bactericidal}} and fungicidal activity (FA). Despite increased expression of lysozyme protein in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) sinus mucosa, CRS patients experience repeated bacterial and/or fungal infections. Commercial <b>sinus</b> <b>irrigation</b> solutions {{are often used}} to provide symptomatic relief. However, one of the mechanisms of action of lysozyme involves ionic interactions with the microbial cell wall, which may be inhibited by ionic solutions such as commercial <b>sinus</b> <b>irrigation</b> solutions. OBJECTIVE: Determine if the FA of lysozyme is reduced {{in the presence of}} solutions with increasing ionic strength and inhibited in the presence of commercial <b>sinus</b> <b>irrigation</b> solutions. METHODS: Using an in vitro colony-forming unit (CFU) assay, the FA of lysozyme (5 μM) was tested against a fungi commonly isolated from CRS patients, Aspergillus fumigatus, in solutions of increasing ionic strength or commercial <b>sinus</b> <b>irrigation</b> solutions. FA was presented as percent of control. RESULTS: FA of lysozyme against A. fumigatus was 95 % in a 21 -mM ionic strength solution. However, with increasing ionic strength, FA decreased and was abolished in a 46 -mM ionic strength solution. Commercial <b>sinus</b> <b>irrigation</b> solutions abolished the FA of lysozyme against A. fumigatus. CONCLUSION: The in vitro FA of lysozyme is dependent on the ionic strength of the solution. The use of <b>sinus</b> <b>irrigation</b> solutions should be further evaluated with regard to maintaining functional activity of cationic antimicrobial peptides involved in sinonasal innate immunity.

40|$|Bacterial biofilms {{are a major}} {{obstacle}} in management of recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis. NVC- 422 is a potent, fast-acting, broad-spectrum, nonantibiotic, antimicrobial with a new mechanism of action effective against biofilm bacteria in in vitro conditions. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the safety and efficacy of NVC- 422 as local antibiofilm treatment in a sheep model of rhinosinusitis. After accessing and occluding frontal sinus ostia in 24 merino sheep via staged endoscopic procedures, S. aureus clinical isolate was instilled in frontal sinuses. Following biofilm formation, ostial obstruction was removed and sinuses irrigated with 0. 1 % and 0. 5 % NVC- 422 in 5 mM acetate isotonic saline at pH 4. 0. Sheep were monitored for adverse effects and euthanized 24 hours after treatment. Frontal <b>sinuses</b> were assessed <b>for</b> infection and changes in mucosa after the treatment. S. aureus biofilms were identified with Baclight-confocal scanning microscopy protocol and the biofilm biomass assayed by applying the COMSTAT 2 program to recorded image stacks. After 2 irrigations with 0. 1 % NVC- 422, S. aureus biofilm biomass was reduced when compared to control sinuses (p = 0. 0001), though this effect was variable in samples. NVC- 422 0. 5 % solution irrigations reduced biofilm even more significantly and consistently over all samples (p < 0. 0001). NVC- 422 0. 5 % was also more effective than 0. 1 % NVC- 422, vehicle control, and normal saline <b>sinus</b> <b>irrigations</b> in reducing biofilm biomass (p < 0. 05 for all subgroups). No adverse events were observed in sheep after <b>sinus</b> <b>irrigations</b> with 0. 1 % and 0. 5 % NVC- 422 solutions. NVC- 422 is an effective topical agent against S. aureus biofilms, with dose-dependent efficacy in this animal model of biofilm-associated sinusitis.

40|$|Background: Maxillary sinus {{augmentation}} is {{a common}} method for increasing bone height for insertion of dental implants. In most cases, the graft is manually cut into a roughly appropriate shape by visual estimation during the operation; accordingly, {{the shape of the}} graft depends considerably on the experience of the surgeon. We have developed a computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technique to generate custom-made block grafts <b>for</b> <b>sinus</b> augmentation, and a customized cutting guide to precisely position the lateral wall and facilitate membrane elevation, using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods: Custom-made blocks of hydroxyapatite (HA) were preoperatively cut to the required shape, based on a three-dimensional (3 D) simulation, using CAD/CAM technology. The custom-made HA blocks were used <b>for</b> <b>sinus</b> augmentation. Results: Five patients underwent bilateral sinus elevation with custom-made HA blocks. Six months later, implants were placed. Two years after placement, all implants were in function. No clinical or prosthetic complications were encountered.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Effective {{treatment}} for recalcitrant rhinosinusitis requires unobstructed surgical marsupialization of sinus cavities {{and use of}} delivery systems that will topically penetrate the sinuses. AIMS: To {{determine the extent of}} sinus penetration achieved with nasal irrigation by varying the ostial size and head position. METHODS: Ten thawed fresh-frozen cadaver heads were dissected in a staged manner. After each stage of dissection, <b>sinus</b> squeeze-bottle <b>irrigations</b> were performed in three head positions, and endoscopes placed via external ports into the sinus cavities viewed the sinus ostia. An ordinal scale was developed to grade ostial penetration of irrigations. Three reviewers independently graded the outcomes. RESULTS: Irrigant entry into sinuses increased with ostial size (P <. 001) and the greatest differential of improvement in sinus penetration is obtained at an ostial size of 4. 7 mm. Stages 2 and 3 (larger sinus ostia) of maxillary and sphenoid dissections have statistically greater irrigant penetration relative to earlier stages. Frontal <b>sinus</b> <b>irrigation</b> is worse in vertex to ceiling head position. There {{does not appear to be}} any significant advantage to head position with maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the larger the sinus ostium, the better the penetration of irrigant into the sinus, with an ostium of at least 4. 7 mm allowing maximal penetration in the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. The same benefit was not noted in the frontal sinus. Head position was only relevant to the frontal sinus where less penetration was seen with the head neutral (vertex to ceiling) position when compared to forward angled positions.
