After several more minor releases throughout 2006 which mostly fixed bugs and made small {{adjustments to the}} modification, the next major release of Europa Barbarorum was version 0.80 in December 2006. Its changes included {{the addition of the}} Sabaean faction, new music, and the inclusion of a new military–industrial complex system. There were three more 0.8-series releases {{during the first half of}} 2007 which primarily made minor adjustments to the modification and fixed bugs. In total, over 135,000 downloads of the 0.80–0.81 versions were tracked.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{buildings}} are open <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>as</b> {{part of the}} Rancho Camulos Museum, {{all of which were}} built before 1930 and are still in their original locations.

Later buildings were designed in differing architectural styles, more representative of their period of construction. Landscaping features, such as lawns, flower gardens, ornamental trees, and walkways, separate the residential areas from the working portions of the ranch.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Universal's conduct {{amounted}} to {{an abuse of}} judicial process, {{and in that sense}} caused a longer harm <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>as</b> a whole. Depending on the commercial results, Universal alternatively argued to the courts, first, that King Kong {{was a part of the}} public domain, and then second, that King Kong was not part of the public domain, and that Universal possessed exclusive trademark rights in it. Universal's assertions in court were based not on any good faith belief in their truth, but on the mistaken belief that it could use the courts to turn a profit.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{long period}} of decline, the house was {{purchased}} in the 1980s by a group of local residents and restored as part of its conversion to offices. It became a focal point for Ickenham during the biennial Ickenham Festival when the grounds were used to host the main gala day, until the house's new owners restricted access in 2014.

Behind these structures lie the grand Borom Ratchasathit Mahoran Hall, which has been recently rebuilt. None of the rooms are open <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> <b>as</b> state functions are still carried out within. The changing of the guards occurs at the front courtyard every two hours.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in November 2004 {{engineers}} identified {{cracks in}} the terrace supporting the Memorial Gardens, and they were closed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>as</b> a potential hazard.

Lutyens's memorial was dismantled and cleaned, and reassembled {{at a higher level}} to be visible from the street; it was also rotated 180° to face City Hall, rather than the market. The terrace was strengthened, and the gardens were landscaped around a new sculpture by Paul de Monchaux on the original site of the memorial.|$|E
