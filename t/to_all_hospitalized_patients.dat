CDC recommends that influenza antiviral treatment be given <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients</b> with confirmed, probable, or suspected novel influenza A (H 1 N 1) and any patient with confirmed, probable or suspected novel influenza A (H 1 N 1) who is at higher risk for seasonal influenza complications. All hospitalized patients should be carefully monitored and treated with antiviral medications as soon as possible after admission, including patients who seek treatment more than 48 hours after onset of symptoms. The drugs recommended for treatment are either oseltamivir or zanamivir. The novel H 1 N 1 viruses are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine.

40|$|Hospitals are habitually {{thought of}} as places where people "recover from disease". But failure to control agents of disease in these {{institutions}} can create or worsen disease and infection; such nosocomial infections constitute a major threat <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients.</b> The German cockroach (Blattella germanica) {{can be an effective}} transmitter of nosocomial infections by virtue of its ubiquitous presence and its behavioral characteristics. This research is focused on nosocomial organisms in Imam Khomeini and Shariati hospitals (belonging to Tehran University of Medical Sciences) and may be a first step in devising effective infection control strategies. After recording data on the collection site, the collected cockroaches were transferred to a laboratory, where bacteria and fungi were isolated from the body surface and the digestive tube. The specimens were also subjected to insecticide sensitivity tests by the mortality and knock-down test methods. Cultures of the external body surface yielded a total of 77 fungal colonies (filamentous fungi, Actinomycetes, yeasts and yeast-like organisms), while those of the digestive tract produced 83 colonies. Notable among these isolates were the highly virulent Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus species. Bacterial studies showed that 100 % of the roaches carried rich bacterial floras, most commonly including Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Proteus, Citrobacter, Enterobacter and Serratia species. Many of these bacteria demonstrated antibiotic resistance, suggesting that the contaminants belonged to the hospital milieu. These results establish cockroaches as effective mechanical transmitters of multi-drug resistant bacteria. Mortality tests revealed a high degree of resistance to permethrin, tolerance to Aicon, and sensitivity to other insecticides. Knock-down tests showed high permethrin resistance, tolerance to Aicon and deltamethrin, and sensitivity to Sulfac...|$|E

40|$|Venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) complications are {{the leading}} cause of preventable in-hospital mortality and morbidity in the United States. Initiatives by the National Quality Forum, the Joint Commission, and the Surgical Care Improvement Project aim to improve the prevention of VTE and emphasize the need to recognize the risk of the condition in <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients.</b> In clinical practice, individual risk assessment using a validated scoring system provides patients with the best care in the prevention of VTE. This is accomplished by a weighted scoring of risk factors, selection of the most appropriate prevention strategy for patients at risk, and regular risk review across the continuum of care. All hospitals should have a local, written, care pathway which assesses inpatient risk of VTE as early as possible upon admission and identifies members of the health care team responsible for applying risk assessment. Venous thromboembolism risk should be regularly reassessed for any changes in the level of risk, with extended out-of-hospital prophylaxis considered for patients with continued risk factors, such as prolonged immobility or illness, treated at home, or in a long-term care facility. Finally, a mandatory alert system requiring the clinician {{to address the issue of}} prophylaxis before any orders are carried out by the nursing staff is one way <b>to</b> protect <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R

Patients and methods: Patients surviving severe TBI were identified from The Danish National Patient Registry and The Danish Head Trauma Database. Overall incidence rates of surviving severe TBI and incidence rates of admission to HS-rehabilitation after severe TBI were estimated and compared. Patient-related predictors of no admission to HS-rehabilitation among patients surviving severe TBI were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Results: The average incidence rate of surviving severe TBI was 2. 3 per 100, 000 person years. Incidence rates of HS-rehabilitation were generally stable around 2. 0 per 100, 000 person years. Overall, 84 % of all patients surviving severe TBI were admitted to HS-rehabilitation. Female sex, older age, and non-working status pre-injury were independent predictors of no HS-rehabilitation among patients surviving severe TBI. Conclusion: The incidence rate of <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients</b> surviving severe TBI was stable in Denmark {{and the majority of}} the patients were admitted to HS-rehabilitation. However, potential inequity in access to HS-rehabilitation may still be present despite a health care system based on equal access for all citizens.

40|$|Objective: Urinary {{catheterization}} {{is one of}} {{most common}} practices in medical centers and hospitals. Despite the advantages of catheterization, it might cause serious complications such as trauma, urinary tract infection and urinary incontinence. Therefore, improper insertion of the catheter is not only useless, but may also cause morbidity and mortality, cost of diagnosis and treatment and waste of time. Materials and Methods: In the retrospective study conducted during 2013 <b>to</b> 2014, <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients</b> in Infectious Disease ward of Sina hospital in Tabriz were examined and information in respective checklists was recorded. Finally data were analyzed by SPSS 16 software. Results: Among the 723 patients, 94 (13 %) who had undergone catheterization. Twenty-five patients who were catheterized before referring to emergency were excluded. Finally, 69 patients (9. 5 %) were studied. The mean age was 21. 85 ± 65. 39. Forty-seven patients (68. 1 %) were catheterized. Twenty-two patients (31. 9 %) were improperly catheterized. Causes of improper catheterization were: to make nursing easier and patient care with 9 people (40. 9 %), medical failure with 8 people (36. 4 %) and taking urine samples with 5 people (22. 7 %). Thirty percent of patients had complications such as hematuria, urinary incontinence and urinary tract infection.

MethodsA single-day snapshot was performed on 12 March 2009 in French public and privates hospitals. Investigators were encouraged <b>to</b> include <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients</b> with a diagnosis of AHF, irrespective {{of the time of}} admission. Planned hospitalizations and cardiac surgery setting were excluded. Relevant data was recorded about medical journeys and outcome was assessed after discharge. ResultsThe survey included 1817 patients (77 ± 13 y, 45 % females) in 170 centers from cardiology wards (58 %) as well intensive care units (18 %) and internal medicine (24 %). Before definitive admission at hospital, most patients were firstly examined by family doctors (41 %) or cardiologist (18 %). Mobile medical units were required in 33 % of cases and patients were admitted in cardiac intensive care unit in 41 % of cases. In-hospital mortality was 8. 8 %. Most survivors were discharged at home (66 %) or in rehabilitation centers (5 %) or in nursing homes (19 %). Patients were followed by family doctors in 63 % of cases, private cardiologists in 33 % and hospital doctors in 32 %; only 5 % were included in HF networks or ambulatory HF units. At 3 months, the rate of allcause death was 17. 8 % and the rate of hospitalization was 30. 9 %.

40|$|To {{describe}} antiviral {{use among}} older, hospitalized adults during six influenza seasons (2006 - 2012) in Davidson County, Tennessee, USA. Among adults ≥ 50 years old hospitalized with symptoms of respiratory illness or non-localizing fever, we collected information on provider-initiated influenza testing and nasal/throat swabs for influenza by RT-PCR {{in a research}} laboratory, and calculated the proportion treated with antivirals. We enrolled 1753 adults hospitalized with acute respiratory illness. Only 26 % (457 / 1753) of enrolled patients had provider-initiated influenza testing. Thirty-eight patients had a positive clinical laboratory test, representing 2. 2 % of total patients and 8. 3 % of tested patients. Among the 38 subjects with clinical laboratory-confirmed influenza, 26. 3 % received antivirals compared to only 4. 5 % of those with negative clinical influenza tests and 0. 7 % of those not tested (p< 0. 001). There were 125 (7. 1 %) patients who tested positive for influenza in the research laboratory. Of those with research laboratory-confirmed influenza, 0. 9 %, 2. 7 %, and 2. 8 % received antivirals (p=. 046) during pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic influenza seasons, respectively. Both research laboratory-confirmed influenza (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3. 04 95 %CI 1. 26 - 7. 35) and clinical laboratory-confirmed influenza (AOR 3. 05, 95 %CI 1. 07 - 8. 71) were independently associated with antiviral treatment.

40|$|Clot {{formation}} {{within a}} deep vein is called {{deep vein thrombosis}} (DVT). It occurs in about 100 persons per 100, 000 population {{each year in the}} United States and leads to about 600, 000 pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) cases and also causes 60, 000 deaths annually. For many years, unfractionated heparin (UFH) and warfarin have been used for treatment of DVT and prevention of PTE. This approach needs hospitalization and necessitates close monitoring by partial thromboplastin time (PTT) measurement. By development of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) the need for laboratory monitoring was resolved. In addition, some investigators also claimed that it is accompanied with less bleeding risk and better outcome. Accordingly, outpatient management of DVT became possible and nowadays American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) advocates outpatient therapy for DVT. This method {{has been shown to be}} safe and effective in presence of home adequacy criteria. Home adequacy is defined by ACCP as “well-maintained living conditions, strong support from family or friends, phone access, and ability to quickly return to the hospital if there is deterioration”. Yet, many physicians in Iran prefer <b>to</b> <b>hospitalize</b> <b>all</b> DVT <b>patients</b> because of their belief in the impossibility of outpatient treatment. </p...|$|R

Planned hospitalizations and cardiac surgery setting were excluded. Relevant data was recorded about whole hospitalizations as well as medical journeys before inclusion and after discharge. Outcome and change in treatments will be assessed during 12 months after discharge. ResultsThe survey included 1817 patients in 170 centers, (77 ± 13 y, 45 % females, LVEF > 50 % in 29 % of pts). IV diuretics and inotropic drugs were used in 86 and 14 % respectively. Non-invasive and invasive ventilation were used in 12 and 6 % of cases. Circulatory support devices were required in 1. 7 % of cases. Echographic examination and coronary angiography were performed in 83 and 21 % of cases respectively. At discharge, diuretics, ACE-I or ARB, betablockers and aldosterone blockers were prescribed in 84, 65, 53 and 17 % of all patients, and in 88, 73, 66 and 25 % of patients with LVEF ≤ 0. 40. In patients with reduced LVEF, variables independently and significantly associated with the lack of ACE-I or ARB were the absence of diabetes and female gender (X 2 = 9. 9 and 8. 5, respectively). Variables independently and significantly associated with the lack of betablockers were pulmonary disease, shock at admission, mental disorders, LVEF, severe renal failure and age (X 2 = 60. 2, 12. 9, 11. 0, 7. 1, 6. 9 and 5. 6, respectively).

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the accuracy of the recorded diagnosis coding of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) in the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR). Methods: The DNPR was used <b>to</b> identify <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients,</b> aged ≥ 15 years, with a first-time diagnosis of HSE according to the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD- 10), from 2004 to 2014. To validate the coding of HSE, we collected data from the Danish Microbiology Database, from departments of clinical microbiology, and from patient medical records. Cases were classified as confirmed, probable, or no evidence of HSE. We estimated the positive predictive value (PPV) of the HSE diagnosis coding stratified by diagnosis type, study period, and department type. Furthermore, we estimated the proportion of HSE cases coded with nonspecific ICD- 10 codes of viral encephalitis and also the sensitivity of the HSE diagnosis coding. Results: We were able to validate 398 (94. 3 %) of the 422 HSE diagnoses identified via the DNPR. Hereof, 202 (50. 8 %) were classified as confirmed cases and 29 (7. 3 %) as probable cases providing an overall PPV of 58. 0 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 53. 0 – 62. 9). For “Encephalitis due to herpes simplex virus” (ICD- 10 code B 00. 4), the PPV was 56. 6 % (95 % CI: 51. 1 – 62. 0). Similarly, the PPV for “Meningoencephalitis due to herpes simplex virus” (ICD- 10 code B 00. 4 A) was 56. 8 % (95 % CI: 39. 5 – 72. 9). “Herpes viral encephalitis” (ICD- 10 code G 05. 1 E) had a PPV of 75. 9 % (95 % CI: 56. 5 – 89. 7), thereby representing the highest PPV. The estimated sensitivity was 95. 5 %. Conclusion: The PPVs of the ICD- 10 diagnosis coding for adult HSE in the DNPR were relatively low.

However, concerns about serious adverse events such as infections, malignancies and death do exist. Objective: To evaluate the occurrence of serious events of infliximab during 9 years in a single-centre cohort of patients with IBD. Methods: Consecutive patients (> 18 years) with a proven diagnosis of 1131) who started treatment for 1131) with infliximab at our referral centre in the Netherlands, from June 1999 to October 2007, were included. Infusion data were collected prospectively and medical records were reviewed retrospectively. All serious events were recorded and scored in the following categories: events leading to hospitalization, infections, malignancies and death. Severity and relationship {{to the use of}} infliximab were assessed for every serious event. Results: 147 patients (33 % male, mean age at first infusion 38 years, standard deviation = 12) received a total number of 1924 infusions (median per patient = 10, range 1 - 70). A total of 89 patients (61 %) were hospitalized during follow-up, involving a total of 300 hospitalizations. Of these, 60 hospitalizations (20 %) were considered at least possibly related to the use of infliximab. In 21 hospitalizations, the occurrence of a serious infection was considered at least possibly related <b>to</b> infliximab. Of <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients,</b> 70 patients (79 %) underwent 139 surgical procedures, of which 70 surgeries (50 %) were gastrointestinal related. Nine patients (6 %) developed malignancies during follow-up: four colorectal carcinomas, one carcinoid tumour with another primary signet-ring cell carcinoma of the small bowel, one breast cancer, two skin cancers and one superficial melanoma.

The implementation of a computer-alert program helps physicians to assess each patient's thrombotic risk, leading to a better use of thromboprophylaxis, and a reduction in the incidence of VTE among <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients.</b> For the first time, an intervention aimed to improve VTE prophylaxis shows maintained effectiveness over time...|$|R
40|$|Background: Differences in {{clinical}} presentation and outcomes among patients infected with pandemic 2009 influenza A H 1 N 1 (pH 1 N 1) {{compared to other}} respiratory viruses have not been fully elucidated. Methodology/Principal Findings: A retrospective study was performed of <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients</b> {{at the peak of}} the pH 1 N 1 season in whom a single respiratory virus was detected by a molecular assay targeting 18 viruses/subtypes (RVP, Lumine...|$|R
40|$|Background: Tight glycemic control (TGC) {{is rapidly}} {{becoming}} {{a standard of}} care for <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients.</b> However, fear of hypoglycemia has proven a potent barrier to adoption of such initiatives by physicians and medical staff. Henry Ford Hospital has pursued aggressive glycemic control for all hospital patients. Because the initial standard TGC protocol (TGCP) was insufficient to improve glycemic control in our bariatric surgery patients, we hypothesized that a more intensive protocol {{would be necessary to}} improve glycemic control for this group...|$|R
40|$|A proper {{strategy}} for fighting hospital malnutrition should include nutritional screening of <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients,</b> adequate {{utilization of the}} Hospital facilities - such as Clinical Nutrition Services or Nutrition Teams - and an adequate algorithm for the adoption of proper nutrition support (oral, enteral or parenteral) with proper timing. The main aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the current policies of different non [...] intensive wards of our institution (a 1, 100 beds University Hospital) in terms of prevention of hospital malnutrition...|$|R
40|$|Hyponatraemia is common, {{affecting}} {{about one}} in five of <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients.</b> Minor degrees of chronic hyponatraemia cause cognitive and motor impairment, and severe hyponatraemia is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a common cause of hyponatraemia and is often poorly understood and inappropriately treated. Clinical evaluation and simple biochemical assessment should guide management. The introduction of vasopressin antagonists, or vaptans, into clinical practice heralds {{the beginning of a}} new and exciting era for this important group of disorders...|$|R
40|$|Background/PurposeExplaining {{the risks}} and {{benefits}} of recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (rtPA) to eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) within a few minutes is important but difficult. We examined whether a new thrombolysis program can decrease the door-to-needle (DTN) time when treating patients with AIS. MethodsA new rtPA thrombolysis program with video assistance was adapted for patients with AIS and their families. We retrospectively compared outcome quality before (2009 – 2011) and after (2012) the program began. Outcomes included DTN time, the percentage of rtPA thrombolysis within 3 hours of onset in <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients</b> with AIS who presented within 2 hours of onset (2 hr%) and the percentage of rtPA thrombolysis in <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients</b> with AIS (AIS%). ResultsWe recruited patients with AIS who had undergone thrombolytic therapy before (n =  18) and after (n =  14) the initiation of the new program. DTN time decreased (93  ±  24 minutes to 57  ±  14 minutes, p <  0. 001) and the AIS% increased (2 % to 5 %, p =  0. 010) after the program. The 2 hr% marginally significantly increased (18 % to 33 %, p =  0. 080). ConclusionA thrombolysis program with video-assisted therapeutic risk communication decreased DTN time and increased the treatment rate of patients with AIS...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{epidemiological}} characteristics of <b>hospitalized</b> burn <b>patients</b> in a tertiary burn centre in Tehran, Iran. A hospital-based cross-sectional study of <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients</b> with burn injuries was conducted in Motahari Burn and Reconstruction Center in Tehran from August to December 2010. Medical records of <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> burn <b>patients</b> were reviewed and pertinent information was captured. A total of 135 patients with severe burns requiring hospitalization were identified during the study period (68. 9 % males, mean age 33 yr). The most common cause of burns was flammable materials/ liquids (e. g. kerosene and gasoline) (56 / 135, 41. 5 %). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that sex (female) and total body surface area (TBSA) burned were the strongest predictors of survival in this cohort. Our findings showed that burn injury continued to be a significant public health problem in Iran, young people (26 - 35 yr) being the most affected. TBSA and sex (female) were found to be the most predictive factors of patient survival...|$|R
30|$|Patients and methods: It was a {{retrospective}} descriptive study, including <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients</b> in intensive care, between January 1 st, 2013 and April 1 st, 2017, with nosocomial enterococcus infections. We recorded demographic and clinical findings, severity scores IGS II, APACHE II, initial SOFA and SOFA {{at the time}} of infection, microbiological, therapeutic and outcome data. Patients infected with vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus (VSE) were compared to those having vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) + then we searched for independent risk factors for VRE. Finally, a multivariate logistic regression was conducted to investigate independent predictive mortality factors.|$|R
40|$|Background: Lactobacillus plantarum 299 v (LP 299 v) {{has been}} used in order to reduce {{gastrointestinal}} symptoms during antibiotic exposure. However, it remains controversial whether or not probiotics are effective in the prevention of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) among patients receiving antibiotics. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the CDI among patients receiving antibiotics and hospitalized in the period before and after starting routine use of LP 299 v as a prevention of this infection. Methods: Among 3533 <b>patients</b> <b>hospitalized</b> in the nephrology and transplantation ward during a two-year period, 23 patients with CDI were diagnosed and enrolled in this retrospective study. Since November 2013, prevention of CDI with oral use of LP 299 v was performed in all patients treated with antibiotics and who were at a high risk of developing CDI. The observation period was divided into two twelve-month intervals before and after initiation of the use of LP 299 v as a prophylactic against CDI. Results: A significant (p = 0. 0001) reduction of the number of cases of CDI was found after routinely using LP 299 v (n = 2; 0. 11 % of <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients)</b> compared with the previous twelve-month period of observation (n = 21; 1. 21 % of <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients).</b> Conclusions: Routine use of LP 299 v during treatment with antibiotics may prevent C. difficile infection in the nephrology and transplantation ward...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe CDC {{estimates}} that 12 – 25 % of <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients</b> receive a urinary catheter during their hospital stay. Foley catheter failure is uncommon and Foley catheter failure associated with iatrogenic urinary bladder rupture (IUBR) is extremely rare. Symptoms are often nonspecific and thus misdiagnosis and delayed treatment is common. In this case report, {{we present a}} case of IUBR in a woman from Foley catheter failure, which ultimately led to her demise. This case adds to the literature the importance of suspicion for IUBR in patients with indwelling Foley catheters presenting with lower abdominal pain, hematuria, and decreased urine output...|$|R
30|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} as a prospective observational cohort study. A detailed history of the poisoning and of the onset and dynamics of ocular and systemic toxicity was obtained in a prospective manner directly from the patients or from relatives of critically ill patients upon admission to hospital. The discharge reports of <b>all</b> <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patients</b> with a confirmed diagnosis of acute methanol poisoning and the results of neurological and ophthalmological examinations on admission, during hospitalization, and on discharge were collected and analyzed in the Czech Toxicological Information Center (TIC). The patients who died outside hospital and the patients treated without enhanced elimination methods were excluded from the study.|$|R
