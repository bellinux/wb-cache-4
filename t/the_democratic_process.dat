During general elections, Singaporeans still continue to elect MPs who best represent their interests, and NMPs do not feature in the equation. In other words, the NMP scheme has never compromised <b>the</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>process</b> of free elections.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{used the}} Ministry of Information's electoral {{education}} campaign as a partisan political tool. Instead of using it purely to explain <b>the</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>process,</b> {{the campaign was}} used to extol Diệm and his allies. After explaining what democracy was, a pamphlet outlined why Deposing a chief-of-state is a vital act. After elaborating on {{the powers of the}} head of state, the pamphlet went on to champion Diệm as an anti-communist who could defend people's freedom, while explaining why Bảo Đại was unfit to lead, saying {{that he did not have}} respect among the international community.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Hitler's release from prison, {{politics}} in Germany had become less combative and the economy had improved, limiting Hitler's opportunities for political agitation. As {{a result of the}} failed Beer Hall Putsch, the NSDAP and its affiliated organisations were banned in Bavaria. In a meeting with the Prime Minister of Bavaria Heinrich Held on 4 January 1925, Hitler agreed to respect the state's authority and promised that he would seek political power only through <b>the</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>process.</b> The meeting {{paved the way for the}} ban on the NSDAP to be lifted on 16 February. However, after an inflammatory speech he gave on 27 February, Hitler was barred from public speaking by the Bavarian authorities, a ban that remained in place until 1927. To advance his political ambitions in spite of the ban, Hitler appointed Gregor Strasser, Otto Strasser and Joseph Goebbels to organise and grow the NSDAP in northern Germany. Gregor Strasser steered a more independent political course, emphasising the socialist elements of the party's programme.|$|E

5|$|Parliamentary {{sovereignty}} {{means that}} Parliament can, if it chooses, legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights. The Human Rights Act 1998 will not detract from this power. The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal. But {{the principle of}} legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in <b>the</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>process.</b> In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume {{that even the most}} general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual. In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.|$|E

Following the murder of ANC activist Chris Hani, Mandela made a publicised speech to calm rioting, soon after appearing at a mass funeral in Soweto for Tambo, who {{had died of a}} stroke. In July 1993, both Mandela and de Klerk visited the US, independently meeting President Bill Clinton and each receiving the Liberty Medal. Soon after, Mandela and de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway. Influenced by Thabo Mbeki, Mandela began meeting with big business figures, and played down his support for nationalisation, fearing that he would scare away much-needed foreign investment. Although criticised by socialist ANC members, he had been encouraged to embrace private enterprise by members of the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist parties at the January 1992 World Economic Forum in Switzerland.|$|E

It addresses the following specific questions. What has been the role of state institutions in <b>the</b> <b>democratic</b> consolidation <b>process?</b> To what extent have the political parties and the de facto two-party system been institutionalized and what has been their contribution in <b>the</b> <b>democratic</b> consolidation <b>process?</b> How vibrant are civil society and interest groups and what has been their contribution in <b>the</b> <b>democratic</b> consolidation <b>process?</b> What are the challenges and constraints faced by state institutions, the institutionalized political parties and party system, as well as civil society and interest groups in contributing to <b>the</b> <b>democratic</b> consolidation <b>process?</b> What measures should be adopted {{to deal with these}} challenges and constraints? Focusing on the July 2012 presidential succession and the December 2012 general elections as case studies, the analysis in this thesis demonstrates that state institutions such as the Executive, Parliament, the Judiciary, the Electoral Commission and the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice, as well as an institutionalized political parties and party system and civil society and interest groups have made some contribution in <b>the</b> <b>democratic</b> consolidation <b>process.</b> However, <b>the</b> analysis also demonstrates that there are a few challenges and constraints {{that need to be addressed}} before Ghana can be considered a consolidated democrac...|$|R

He had campaigned throughout New York, visiting all 62 counties on several occasions, and had built strong support among political leaders and community groups. In addition, Benjamin received the majority of his financial support in small donations, with only $2,500 from Political Action Committees (PACs). Mills had raised $200,000 less than Benjamin, and a large portion of his campaign contributions came from PACs.|$|E
25|$|From a {{political}} perspective, Kemalism is anti-clerical {{in that it}} seeks to prevent religious influence on <b>the</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>process,</b> which was a problem even in the largely secular politics of the Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire, when even non-religiously affiliated political parties like the Committee of Union and Progress and the Freedom and Accord Party feuded over matters such as the Islamic piety of their candidates in the Ottoman elections of 1912. Thus, in the Kemalist political perspective, politicians cannot {{claim to be the}} protector of any religion or religious sect, and such claims constitute sufficient legal grounds for the permanent banning of political parties.|$|E
