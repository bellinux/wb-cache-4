The episodes {{received}} generally positive reviews from commentators, {{many of whom}} felt that the series was successfully able <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>up</b> its story arcs. Rosenbaum's return was met with critical applause; however, the artistic decision to not show Welling in the full Superman suit and instead to render Superman using computer-generated imagery (CGI) was met with negativity.|$|E
5|$|It was {{something}} we wanted <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>up</b> to a certain extent. It's a disservice to Rick's character {{to make him look}} like he's completely clueless. But this isn't really a resolution per se. It makes things a little bit more tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now the audience has one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s going to be fun waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E

On 2 April, {{he made his}} debut in their first match, replacing Robbie Findley for the final 12 minutes of a goalless home draw against FC Edmonton.

5|$|The {{police have}} little success with street-level arrests or with {{securing}} informants beyond Bubbles, a well known West Side drug addict. Eventually the investigation takes {{the direction of}} electronic surveillance, with wiretaps and pager clones to infiltrate the security measures taken by the Barksdale organization. This leads the investigation to areas the commanding officers had hoped to avoid, including political contributions. When an associate of Avon Barksdale is arrested by State Police and offers to cooperate, the commanding officers order the detail to undertake a sting operation <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>up</b> the case. Detective Kima Greggs is seriously hurt in the operation, triggering an overzealous response {{from the rest of}} the department. This causes the detail's targets to suspect that they are under investigation.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Cross employs story arcs, characters, {{and themes}} from , a Satellaview side story to Chrono Trigger {{released}} in Japan. An illustrated text adventure, Radical Dreamers was created <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>up</b> an unresolved plot line of Chrono Trigger. Though it borrows from Radical Dreamers in its exposition, Chrono Cross {{is not a}} remake of Radical Dreamers, but a larger effort to fulfill that game's purpose; the plots of the games are irreconcilable. To resolve continuity issues and acknowledge Radical Dreamers, the developers of Chrono Cross suggested the game happened in a parallel dimension. A notable {{difference between the two}} games is that Magus—present in Radical Dreamers as Gil—is absent from Chrono Cross. Director Masato Kato originally planned for Magus to appear in disguise as Guile, but scrapped the idea due to plot difficulties. In the DS version of Chrono Trigger, Kato teases the possibility of an amnesiac Magus.|$|E
