5|$|In {{the early}} years, Australia's athletes did poorly; only two athletes {{placed in the}} top half of their events before 1976, while the vast {{majority}} placed in the bottom quarter, including some who finished last. This lack of success was attributed to the Australian culture, climate and lack of snow, as well as <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the athletes—sports administrators regarded investment in winter sports as futile.|$|E

5|$|The Naval Academy's {{first ever}} {{football}} team was fielded in 1879. The squad was entirely student-operated, receiving no official support from Naval Academy officials. The team was entirely funded by {{its members and}} their fellow students. This would continue until 1892, when that season's team was led by coach Ben Crosby. The 1879 team participated in just one game, {{which resulted in a}} scoreless tie. It was played against the Baltimore Athletic Club, at most likely an unused drill field on the Naval Academy campus. Navy would not field a football team in 1880 or 1881, likely due to <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Clark {{finally left}} Fort Pitt in August 1781, he was {{accompanied}} by only 400 men, although he expected to meet Lochry and his Pennsylvanians at Fort Henry (present Wheeling, West Virginia).

5|$|According to Ellsworth P. Bertholf's biographer C. Douglas Kroll, {{the first}} {{evidence}} of a form of football at the United States Naval Academy came in 1857, but the school's cadets lost interest in the game shortly afterward. The Naval Academy's first ever football team was fielded in 1879. The squad was entirely student-operated, receiving no official support from Naval Academy officials. The team was entirely funded by its members and their fellow students. The 1879 team participated in just one game, {{which resulted in a}} scoreless tie. It was played against the Baltimore Athletic Club, apparently on the Academy superintendent's cow pasture. Navy would not field a football team in 1880 or 1881, due to <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> from officials. When football returned to the academy in 1882, the squad was led by player-coach Vaulx Carter, and won 8–0 in a match with Johns Hopkins, starting a seven-year rivalry between the schools. The 1883 season resulted in Navy's first ever loss, a 2–0 defeat by Johns Hopkins. Navy returned the favor the following year, defeating Hopkins in a close 9–6 game.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when they}} reached the American compound, Lownds refused to give them entry because he feared that North Vietnamese {{soldiers}} may have mingled with the crowd. Instead, Lownds ordered his soldiers to herd the civilians into bomb craters, disarmed the local soldiers, and kept them under guard even though North Vietnamese artillery shells continued to rain down on the base. No food or medical aid was given to the civilians as they were kept outside the wires of the American compound. Frustrated by <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> and poor treatment by the Americans, Phetsampou complained that his people were being treated more like an enemy. On 10 February, Laotian civilian refugees started walking back to Laos along Highway 9, because they feared for their lives and preferred to die in their own country. On February 15, through arrangements made by the Laotian embassy in Saigon, the Laotian commander and his soldiers were flown back to their country on a Royal Laotian Air Force C-47 transport aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In response, {{and hoping}} to win wider support for his government, Montfort summoned a new {{parliament}} for 20 January 1265 which continued until mid March that year. It was held at short notice, with the summons being issued on 14 December, leaving little time for attendees to respond. He summoned not only the barons, senior churchmen and two knights from each county, but also two burgesses {{from each of the}} major towns such as York, Lincoln, Sandwich, and the Cinque Ports, the first time this had been done. Due to <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for Montfort among the barons, only 23 of them were summoned to parliament, in comparison to the summons issued to 120 churchmen, who largely supported the new government; it is unknown how many burgesses were called. The event was overseen by King Henry, and held in the Palace of Westminster, London, which was the largest city in England, and whose continuing loyalty was essential to Montfort's cause.|$|E

5|$|The French, who {{had started}} {{construction}} on Fort Carillon in 1755, {{used it as a}} launching point for the successful siege of Fort William Henry in 1757. Despite that and other successes in North America in 1757, the situation did not look good for them in 1758. As early as March, Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, the commanding general responsible of the French forces in North America, and the Marquis de Vaudreuil, New France's governor, were aware that the British were planning to send large numbers of troops against them, and that they would have relatively little support from King Louis XV of France. <b>The</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> from France was in large part due to an unwillingness of the French military to risk the movement of significant military forces across the Atlantic Ocean, which was dominated by Britain's Royal Navy. This situation was further exacerbated by Canada's poor harvest in 1757, which resulted in food shortages as the winter progressed.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} record contains few details of Romulus' life. He {{was the son}} of Orestes, a Roman who once served as a secretary in the court of Attila the Hun before coming into the service of Julius Nepos in AD 475. In the same year he was promoted to the rank of magister militum, but then led a military revolt that forced Nepos to flee into exile. With the capital of Ravenna under his control, Orestes appointed his son, Romulus to the throne despite <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> from the eastern court in Constantinople. Romulus, however, {{was little more than a}} child and figurehead for his father's rule. After ten months in power, during which time his authority and legitimacy were disputed beyond Italy, Romulus was forced to abdicate by Odoacer, a Germanic foederatus officer who defeated and executed Orestes. After seizing control of Ravenna, Odoacer sent the former emperor to live in the Castellum Lucullanum in Campania, after which he disappears from the {{historical record}}.|$|E
5|$|The limited {{scope of}} the Instruments of Accession {{and the promise of}} a wide-ranging {{autonomy}} and the other guarantees they offered, gave sufficient comfort to many rulers, who saw this as the best deal they could strike given <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> from the British, and popular internal pressures. Between May 1947 and the transfer of power on 15 August 1947, the vast majority of states signed Instruments of Accession. A few, however, held out. Some simply delayed signing the Instrument of Accession. Piploda, a small state in central India, did not accede until March 1948. The biggest problems, however, arose with a few border states, such as Jodhpur, which tried to negotiate better deals with Pakistan, with Junagadh, which actually did accede to Pakistan, and with Hyderabad and Kashmir, which declared that they intended to remain independent.|$|E
5|$|The {{visit to}} the US was the high point in Diệm's {{relations}} with his primary sponsor. The Americans began to place increasing pressure on Diệm to carry out democratic reforms and liberalize the political system, particularly during ambassadorship of Elbridge Durbrow. Diệm resisted the calls to broaden {{the base of his}} government and continued to rig elections. Meanwhile in the US, his support among the AFV also declined, in part due to his ongoing authoritarianism, and also because of his persistent complaints to them about negative media depictions of his regime; many Vietnamese leaders of various persuasions did not understand that western governments did not control their own media. Pressure also increased on Diệm at home, as the communists intensified their insurgency against him. In November 1960, discontent in his own army prompted a failed coup attempt by paratroopers. Although Diệm eventually organized for loyalists to put down the coup, he was angered by Durbrow's calls for him to try to negotiate a settlement, regarding <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for his zero tolerance policy as a betrayal.|$|E

5|$|The year 1720 {{brought an}} end to {{external}} threats to Rogers' rule. With Spain and Britain at peace again, the Spanish made no further move against the Bahamas. Vane never returned, having been shipwrecked and captured in the Bay Islands—a year later, he was hanged in Jamaica. This did not end Rogers' problems as governor. Overextended from financing New Providence's defences, he received no assistance from Britain, and merchants refused to give him further credit. His health suffered, and he spent six weeks in Charleston, South Carolina, hoping to recuperate. Instead, he was wounded in a duel with Captain John Hildesley of HMS Flamborough (1707), a duel caused by disputes between the two on New Providence. Troubled by <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> and communication from London, Rogers set sail for Britain in March 1721. He arrived three months later to find that a new governor had been appointed, and his company had been liquidated. Personally liable for the obligations he had contracted at Nassau, he was imprisoned for debt.|$|E
5|$|To be {{inducted}} in the National Baseball Hall of Fame, a player must receive at least 75% {{of the vote}} from the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) or the Veterans Committee.
