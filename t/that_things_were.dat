5|$|WWE 2K16 {{details the}} {{historical}} career of Steve Austin, {{from his days}} at ECW when he was angry <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> {{not going to happen}} in a good sense for him to WCW when he and Brian Pillman began to become a strong tag team leading to Austin suffering injury and going through a rub shot in WWE as Stone Cold, an anti-hero that {{was not going to be}} tame into a corporate man. Video Packages contain commentary that was remixed from WWE '13 and WWE 2K14 with the exception of some not documented before. Through DLC, the WWE Hall of Fame showcase contains what if matches and some from WCW; these matches were announced on Oct 7th 2015 and to be released alongside the Deluxe Editions of the video game.|$|E
25|$|Back in Europe, {{interest}} in the new Technikum was kept high. In 1909 Dr. Chaim Weizmann, who would later become President of the State of Israel, reported to a Zionist conference in Manchester <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> going well with the “National Polytecnikum”. Wealthy Jews from many lands were already promising generous support.|$|E
25|$|Lock {{numbering}} {{changed over}} the years. As mentioned before, Guard Lock No. 2 was numbered Lock 24 for a time, which could cause confusion with Riley's Lock, No 24, upstream. For {{a period of time}} in the early days, the locks were called by letters but that was later changed to numbers. Oddly enough, many of the lock numbers correspond to the contour elevation, e.g. Lock 26 is at the 260 foot elevation line, and lock 30 is at the 300 foot mark, although it is doubted <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> planned that way, and many locks do not correspond to the elevation, e.g. Lock 72 is at the 580 foot mark.|$|E

25|$|Docker {{retired as}} a BSA {{director}} in 1912 and installed Lincoln Chandler on the BSA board as his replacement. Docker liked to draw a comparison between the BSA~Daimler merger he engineered {{and that of his}} 1902 merger of Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Company and Patent Shaft. However, there was not the integration of facilities in the BSA~Daimler case, nor was there a reorganisation of either BSA or Daimler. In view of the earlier criticism contained in the 1909 report of the investigation committee, BSA continued to produce cars of their own, using Daimler engines. In 1913, Daimler employed 5,000 workers to manufacture 1,000 vehicles, an indication <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> not well.|$|E
25|$|Worf avoided Ezri at first, {{confused}} {{about what to do}} about this new situation. Her quick posting to DS9 led to a number of awkward moments between her and Worf, since the new host carried all the memories of their former hosts but had its own distinct personality, despite their shared past. Also, it was considered taboo on Trill for new hosts to fraternize with former lovers. After a brief rekindling of their feelings for one another, they decided <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> just too different and, eventually, the two settled into a comfortable friendship, with Ezri eventually becoming romantically involved with Julian Bashir (who previously had feelings for Jadzia). This allowed Worf to accept 'his' Jadzia to have her place into Sto-Vo-Kor.|$|E
25|$|The {{winter of}} 194445 was {{especially}} difficult {{for most of}} the population. Inflation showed no sign of slowing down and food shortages were severe. The prime minister and the other Gaullists were forced to try to balance the desires of ordinary people and public servants for a return to normal life with pressure from Bidault's MRP and the Communists for the large scale nationalisation programme and other social changes that formed the main tenets of the CNR Charter. At the end of 1944 the coal industry and other energy companies were nationalised, followed shortly afterwards by major banks and finance houses, the merchant navy, the main aircraft manufacturers, airlines and a number of major private enterprises such as the Renault car company at Boulogne-Billancourt, whose owner had been implicated as a collaborator and accused of having made huge profits working for the Nazis. In some cases, unions, feeling <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> not progressing quickly enough, took matters into their own hands, occupying premises and setting up workers' committees to run the companies. Women were also allowed the vote for the first time, a new social security system was introduced to cover most medical costs, unions were expanded and price controls introduced to try to curb inflation. At de Gaulle's request, the newspaper Le Monde was founded in December 1944 to provide France with a quality daily journal similar to those in other countries. Le Monde took over the premises and facilities of the older Le Temps, whose independence and reputation had been badly compromised during the Vichy years.|$|E

500|$|Initially, the album's {{release date}} was {{reported}} to be November 4, 2008—meaning that it would coincide with the 2008 presidential election. Fall Out Boy later announced on October 13, 2008, that the early November date was in doubt, citing concerns over the planned election day tie-in. The band was stressed out and worked very hard on a tight deadline to get the album out on November 4. While on a promotional tour in Spain, the band realized <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> [...] "spinning out of control", and, in a rushed-out statement, explained: ...|$|E
500|$|Following George W. Bush's {{reelection in}} 2004, she urged {{her husband to}} run again for President, later saying: [...] "I {{literally}} wore black for a week.

I was so against the [...] And I said to Joe, 'You've got to change this, you have to change this.'" [...] During Joe Biden's 2008 campaign to be the Democratic nominee, she continued to teach during the week and would join him for campaigning on weekends. She said that she would have taken an activist role in addressing education as her chief focus of concern as a potential First Lady. She also said that she was basically apolitical and would not seek inclusion in Cabinet meetings.|$|E
500|$|When {{he began}} work on the score for A New Beginning, Manfredini created a theme just for the {{character}} of Tommy Jarvis. The idea was {{to suggest that there}} was [...] "madness afoot", which he believed helped to [...] "'point the finger' at various characters [...] to suggest <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> not as you might expect". For Jason Lives, Tom McLoughlin instructed Manfredini to create a score that would not alert the audience about what was happening or about to happen, [...] "but instead allow the audience to do it to themselves". McLoughlin took this idea from John Carpenter's 1978 film Halloween, which would always follow any shock in the film with Carpenter's [...] "Eeeeeeee!" [...] sound. McLoughlin wanted something more subtle, with a [...] "Gothic" [...] resonance.|$|E

500|$|Clark {{has said}} that he began to truly define his {{politics}} only after his military retirement and the 2000 presidential election, won by George W. Bush. Clark had a conversation with Condoleezza Rice in which she told him that the war in Kosovo would not have occurred under Bush. Clark found such an admission unsettling, as he had been selected for the SACEUR position because he believed more in the interventionist policies of the Clinton administration. He said he would see it as a sign <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> [...] "starting to go wrong" [...] with American foreign policy under Bush. Clark supported the administration's War in Afghanistan in response to the September 11, 2001, attacks but did not support the Iraq War. Clark continued to warn people as a commentator on CNN that he believed the United States was undermanned in Iraq. He said the war was [...] "never ... WMD or regime change" [...] and believes [...] "the connection to the War on Terrorism was not shown." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Enter Sandman" [...] was {{acclaimed}} by critics. Chris True of Allmusic {{declared it}} [...] "one of Metallica’s best moments" [...] and a [...] "burst of stadium level metal that, once {{away from the}} buildup intro, never lets up". According to him, the song's breakdown [...] "brilliantly utilizes that 'Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep' bedtime prayer {{in such a way}} as to add to the scary movie aspect of the song". Steve Huey, in Allmusic review of Metallica, described it as one of the album's best songs, with [...] "crushing, stripped-down grooves". Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone described [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] as [...] "possibly the first metal lullaby" [...] and wrote that the song [...] "tell the tale" [...] of the album's [...] "detail and dynamic, [...] song structures and impact of individual tracks". [...] Sid Smith from the BBC called the song [...] "psycho-dramatic" [...] and noted that the [...] "terse motifs served notice <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> changing" [...] with Metallica's new album. Blender magazine's Tim Grierson says that the lyrics [...] "juxtapose childhood bedtime rituals and nightmarish imagery" [...] and praises the [...] "thick bottom end and propulsive riff".|$|E
500|$|The {{feeling of}} urgency spread {{throughout}} Greenwich Village, even {{to people who}} had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing {{an opportunity to take}} action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picketing in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, called the Annual Reminder. Organizers Craig Rodwell, Frank Kameny, Randy Wicker, Barbara Gittings, and Kay Lahusen, who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties, and all marched quietly in organized lines. This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, [...] "None of that! None of that!" [...] Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches. Participant Lilli Vincenz remembered, [...] "It was clear <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> changing. People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered." [...] Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention. One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day.|$|E

500|$|The website Touch Arcade {{said that}} they loved the game, {{and that it was}} one of their {{favorite}} role-playing games on iOS. They did however think that the game was bad at explaining things, including the system of saving one's progress. Pocket Gamer, too, thought <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> not explained enough. For instance, they said that the game does not guide players from point A to point B, and often does not even let players know where to start looking for point B. RPGFan echoed this, and said that it is not uncommon for players to wander around, wondering where to go. Gamezebo said they did not think the battle system was particularly exciting, but appreciated how the conversation system and the demon fusion adds elements of risk and reward to the game. The British newspaper Metro found the game more entertaining than most role-playing games from its time. Gamezebo found the iOS version's touch screen-based virtual buttons clumsy to use, while Pocket Gamer found the interface to work [...] "reasonably well" [...] while using the landscape mode, and RPGFan found the interface to be excellent. Both Gamezebo and Touch Arcade wished the game had been a [...] "universal app", so that it could have been played on other devices than iPhone and iPod Touch without having the graphics upscaled.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, IGN {{named the}} Dreamcast the 8th {{greatest}} video game console of all time, giving {{credit to the}} innovations and software for the system. [...] According to IGN, [...] "The Dreamcast was the first console to incorporate a built-in modem for online play, and while the networking lacked the polish and refinement of its successors, {{it was the first}} time users could seamlessly power on and play with users around the globe." [...] In 2010, PC Magazines Jeffrey L. Wilson named the Dreamcast the greatest video game console, emphasizing that the system was [...] "gone too soon". In 2013, Edge named the Dreamcast the 10th best console of the last 20 years, highlighting innovations that it added to console video gaming, including in-game voice chat, downloadable content, and second screen technology through the use of VMUs. Edge explained the system's poor performance by stating, [...] "Sega's console was undoubtedly ahead of its time, and it suffered at retail for that reason... ut its influence can still be felt today." [...] Writing in 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, Duncan Harris noted [...] "One of the reasons that older gamers mourned the loss of the Dreamcast was that it signaled the demise of arcade gaming culture... Sega's console gave hope <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> not about to change for the worse and that the tenets of fast fun and bright, attractive graphics were not about to sink into a brown and green bog of realistic war games." [...] Parish, writing for USgamer, contrasted the Dreamcast's diverse library with the [...] "suffocating sense of conservatism" [...] that pervaded the gaming industry in the following decade. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer, discussing the Dreamcast's portrayal [...] "as a small, square, white plastic JFK", commented that the system's short lifespan [...] "may have sealed its reputation as one of the greatest consoles ever": [...] "Nothing builds a cult like a tragic demise". According to IGN's Travis Fahs, [...] "Many hardware manufacturers have come and gone, but it's unlikely any will go out with half as much class as Sega." ...|$|E
