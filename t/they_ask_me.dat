She derided her choreography skills, and elaborated: [...] "I was so nervous that day. I had to keep eating bread and toast because my stomach was so sick. But {{it was an interesting}} experience. It was definitely a challenge for me. Of course if <b>they</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to do it again, I would do it again. But I’m not going to go begging them for it." ...|$|E

500|$|Katherine Tina Valentine was {{introduced}} by former executive producer Edward J. Scott, born onscreen during the episode that aired July 30, 1990. She was portrayed by twins Darla and Sandra Greer from 1990 to 1991, with child actress Danielle Ryah taking over the role briefly in 1994. Upon the character's re-introduction as an adult by executive producer Maria Arena Bell on February 6, 2008, actress Elizabeth Hendrickson assumed the role. Hendrickson was previously known {{for her role as}} Maggie Stone on All My Children, one half of the iconic Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone lesbian supercouple. Having been offered the part in 2007 as a ten-episode guest stint, she was soon promoted to a contract status. Reflecting on her casting, Hendrickson described the process as a [...] "lovely surprise" [...] and said, [...] "I used to always watch Y when I was on AMC. I always liked {{the look and feel of}} the show, so I’ve always been a big fan. Chloe wasn’t even on the page when I came in for a chemistry audition." [...] As a result of the character's positive response, Bell decided to write Chloe's backstory which revealed her to be the daughter of long-running character Esther Valentine (Kate Linder) while also providing her with additional storyline. [...] "Everyone is so pleasant here and it's such a great, warm environment and it just feels really right. If <b>they</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to stay that would be a blessing," [...] Hendrickson said, before being offered a contract. In March 2014, following increased speculation, Hendrickson confirmed her exit from the series, stating: [...] "I need to stretch my wings and fly into the unknown. The one thing that remains true and what I will hold close to my heart as I embark on this new adventure is that I will ALWAYS have you." [...] She made her last appearance on May 27, 2014. Hendrickson reprised the role for one episode on October 14, 2014 to commemorate the passing of Chloe's daughter, Delia. In October 2015, Hendrickson also reprised the role of Chloe from October 12 to 28.|$|E

Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) {{regional}} governor Zaldy Ampatuan was the party's regional chairman. Andal Sr., {{the family}} patriarch, has been provincial governor since 1998; he has been elected three times, unopposed. Eighteen of the mayors in Maguindanao belong to the clan. The elder Ampatuan attributed his popularity to [...] "popular support," [...] adding [...] "Because I am so loved by the constituencies of the municipalities, <b>they</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to have my sons as representatives." [...] In the 2004 presidential elections, Arroyo won 69% of Maguindanao's vote; three years later, the party-backed coalition scored a 12–0 sweep of the senatorial elections in the province. Unable to run for a third term, he is currently grooming his son, Andal Jr., to succeed him as governor.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. <b>They</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E
