500|$|... "Jump" [...] is {{the overall}} seventh and final single off Unapologetic. It {{was written by}} Kevin Cossom and M. B. Williams {{together}} with its producers StarGate (Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen) and Chase & Status (Saul Milton and Will Kennard). The song samples elements of [...] "Pony" [...] (1996), as performed by Ginuwine and written by Elgin [...] "Ginuwine" [...] Lumpkin, Stephen Garrett and Timothy [...] "Timbaland" [...] Mosley. In an interview with MTV News Ginuwine stated: [...] "You know what? My management told me she wanted to use it, and Rihanna, I'm a fan of hers and I love what she's doing. You got to embrace it! You can't be a stickler... especially when an artist like Rihanna wants to use it". He further {{said that he is}} anxious <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> singer has done with the sample and hopes that it will do a good job for her, just as it did for him.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} opening couch gag shows a pastiche of {{the cover}} collage from The Beatles' 1967 album Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which was first used {{earlier in the season}} for [...] "Bart After Dark". Otherwise, the episode refers to other TV shows, including the syndicated couch gag featuring the Flintstone family, recycled from the season four episode [...] "Kamp Krusty", to mark The Simpsons surpassing The Flintstones as the longest-running animated series. Roy calls Homer and Marge Mr. and Mrs. S, which echoes Fonzie calling the Cunninghams [...] "Mr. and Mrs. C" [...] on Happy Days. Later, he decides to move in with [...] "two sexy ladies", recalling Jack Tripper in Three's Company. Homer hiding in the closet <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> network executives were planning to do with Poochie is a reference to Jay Leno reportedly eavesdropping on a conversation between NBC executives on whether he or David Letterman would replace Johnny Carson as the host of The Tonight Show.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Hibbert {{introduces}} a frail Ben Matlock {{to a crowd}} of excited seniors at the Grand Opening of the Center for Geriatric Medicine. After seeing his idol mobbed to the ground by fans, Grampa becomes aware of his mortality and gives the family their inheritances early. He leaves the family a box of old silver dollars that they decide to spend at the mall right away. At the mall, Lisa sees the new talking Malibu Stacy doll in a toy store. Throughout the trip home, Grampa constantly tells stories and spouts useless advice, making the family shun him. Back home, Lisa is anxious <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> talking Malibu Stacy has to say, but is disappointed with her sexist phrases (such as [...] "Don't ask me, I'm just a girl" [...] and [...] "Thinking too much gives you wrinkles"). Lisa is angry {{that no one else}} can see the ridiculousness of the doll. She and Grampa sit at the kitchen table, bemoaning how they are treated because of their age while both of them decide to change, Grampa to get a job, and Lisa to find Malibu Stacy's creator, Stacy Lovell.|$|E

60|$|The way it {{was done}} was this. The Queen ordered him to kneel, and then said that for playing so beautifully she would give him the wish of his heart. Then they all {{gathered}} round Peter <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> was <b>the</b> wish of his heart, but {{for a long time}} he hesitated, not being certain what it was himself.|$|R
2500|$|The Dixie Chicks {{paid tribute}} to Haggard by {{recording}} Darrell Scott's song [...] "Long Time Gone," [...] which criticizes Nashville trends: [...] "We listen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> radio <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what's</b> cookin’/But <b>the</b> music ain't got no soul/ Now they sound tired but they don’t sound Haggard," [...] with the following lines mentioning Johnny Cash and Hank Williams in the same vein.|$|R
500|$|Given {{the task}} of {{overhauling}} the Cardinals by owner Gussie Busch (and specifically to unload Templeton), Herzog was looking to trade Templeton when he was approached by Padres General Manager Jack McKeon at the 1981 baseball winter meetings. While McKeon had previously told Herzog that Smith was untouchable in any trade, the Padres were now so angry at Smith's agent Gottlieb that McKeon was willing to deal. [...] McKeon and Herzog agreed in principle to a six-player trade, with Templeton for Smith as the centerpiece. It was then that Padres manager Dick Williams informed Herzog that a no-trade clause had been included in Smith's 1981 contract. Upon learning of the trade, Smith's initial reaction was to invoke the clause and stay in San Diego, {{but he was still}} interested <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Cardinals had to say. While the deal for the players beside Templeton and Smith went through, Herzog flew to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas holiday. Smith later recalled that, [...] "Whitey told me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the pennant. He made me feel wanted, which was a feeling I was quickly losing from the Padres. The mere fact that Whitey would come all the way out there to talk to us was more than enough to convince me that St. Louis was the place I wanted to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{prosecutor}} wanted more from Hood and Washington, he pressed them further, and allegedly started {{to offer the}} two men cash for their support in bringing justice to the Charlotte Three for their presumed role in the burning of Lazy B Stables. Assistant Attorney General Robert C. Mardian [...] "approved a deal giving Hood and Washington cash payments of four thousand dollars each" [...] which was to help persuade the two men to say what {{the prosecutor}} wanted <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> <b>What</b> <b>the</b> prosecutor wanted was to be able obtain a conviction of the Charlotte Three who were all civil rights leaders and proponents for the end of racism in Charlotte. The three were indicted in January 1972 and this set off a racial firestorm.|$|E
2500|$|For their 1978 {{follow-up}} album, Brakara, Prima Vera {{decided to}} include [...] "Arne Belinda" [...] anyway, by slightly altering the song's melody so that Erik Bye {{could no longer}} be credited as composer. This move gave Prima Vera lots of publicity ahead of the release, and with rumors of Bye going to court to have the album stopped, people flocked to the music stores to secure a copy before the album was withdrawn from the market, and <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> fuss was all about. As a result, Brakara sold [...] copies in Norway, went platinum, and {{reached the top of the}} album chart, where it remained in the top five for 13 weeks. The rumored lawsuit from Erik Bye never came, but in his 2004 autobiography Falsk credits the [...] "Arne Belinda" [...] debacle as the single-biggest reason Brakara topped the charts, claiming this was [...] "the kind of publicity you couldn't buy with all the money in the world", and helped make Prima Vera a national phenomenon.|$|E
60|$|As for the council, {{its members}} were moved {{by more than}} {{ordinary}} curiosity <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> further <b>the</b> missionary might have to say, though all present succeeded admirably in suppressing the exhibition of any interest that might seem weak and womanly. After a decent delay, therefore, Bear's Meat intimated to the parson {{that it would be}} agreeable to the chiefs present to listen to him further.|$|R
5000|$|On August 16, 2011, Twista {{announced}} {{he had begun}} working on his ninth studio album, tilted The Dark Horse. In a May 2012, interview with AllHipHop, he spoke about where the album fits in with what he's done in the past, saying, [...] "I think it fits in perfectly. I {{look at it as}} a continuum, or a protocol. Everybody looks forward <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Twista’s next album will sound like, in the hopes that it sounds like the original material they’ve heard. And I feel like you can always do different projects and venture out, but I definitely feel like when I go down my lane to give them the next Twista album, that I need to make sure that I satisfy the fans, so they can be like ‘yeah!’ It’s going to be the hard music mixed with the melodic music for the radio." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1908 the Swiss {{mountain}} dog appeared for {{the first}} time in public. At a show in Langenthal, Switzerland, Franz Schertenleib [...] a breeder of the Berner [...] showed an extraordinarily strong, short-haired Berner Sennenhund. He had seen this dog and bought him as an oddity. He was eager <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Langenthal judge, Professor Heim, would say about this short-haired Berner. Bello vom Schlossgut was beautifully marked, [...] high, sturdy, and with attractive colors. Heim's first look saw the possibility of a new breed of Sennenhunde. He remembered having seen similar dogs in the 1860s in various parts of Switzerland. He said to Schertenleib, [...] "The dog belongs in a different category; he is too gorgeous and thoroughbred to push him aside as a poor example of a Berner. He is an example of the old-time, almost extinct, butcher dog." [...] Heim wrote in his judge’s notes: [...] "Bello is a marvelous, old Sennen (Butcher) hund of the large, almost extinct breed. Had he been entered under [...] "other breeds" [...] I would have recognized him as grossen Sennenhund and awarded him first prize with pleasure. Since he was entered among the Durrbachs, I cannot give this interesting dog more than second prize. This dog is out of place here." ...|$|E

60|$|At length brother Ned and Tim Linkinwater {{came back}} together, when Tim {{instantly}} {{walked up to}} Nicholas and whispered in his ear in a very brief sentence (for Tim was ordinarily a man of few words), {{that he had taken}} down the address in the Strand, and would call upon him that evening, at eight. Having done which, Tim wiped his spectacles and put them on, preparatory <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>what</b> more <b>the</b> brothers Cheeryble had got to say.|$|R

6000|$|...

6000|$|After a short space, Dr. May desired <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> were <b>the</b> deceptions <b>to</b> which Margaret had alluded, {{and made}} Norman tell {{what he knew}} of the affair of the blotted book.

PopMatters classifies it as a decent album, as it [...] "... maintains the level of quality that Scream Aim Fire had, but doesnt advance back to their prior level of excellence. ... There are more good songs than bad Pleasure and Pain and Dignity, but the bad songs are very seriously flawed, and will likely stand out more than {{the positive aspects of}} the good songs".|$|R
