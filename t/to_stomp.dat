5|$|Early {{into his}} fourth {{season with the}} Canucks, Kesler was {{cross-checked}} in the face by Flyers forward Jesse Boulerice. The cross-check was an immediate response to Kesler hitting Flyers defenseman Randy Jones and resulted in Kesler leaving {{the game with a}} sore jaw. Boulerice was subsequently suspended for 25 games, matching the then largest suspension in NHL history. Later in the season, Kesler was involved in another violent on-ice incident when Anaheim Ducks defenseman Chris Pronger used his skate blade <b>to</b> <b>stomp</b> on Kesler's calf. Kesler was not injured on the play. Although the NHL originally announced that Pronger would not receive a suspension on the play, he later received an eight-game suspension when new video emerged of the incident. Over the course of the season, Kesler established himself as a solid two-way center, scoring what was then a career high 21 goals and 37 points and playing a regular shutdown role against opposing teams' top players and on the penalty kill with linemate Alexandre Burrows.|$|E
25|$|Two {{versions}} of Kong's {{right hand and}} arm were constructed of steel, sponge rubber, rubber, and bearskin. The first hand was non articulated, mounted on a crane, and operated by grips for the scene in which Kong grabs at Driscoll in the cave. The other hand and arm had articulated fingers, was mounted on a lever to elevate it, and {{was used in the}} several scenes in which Kong grasps Ann. A non articulated leg was created of materials similar to the hands, mounted on a crane, and used <b>to</b> <b>stomp</b> on Kong's victims.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, though, Incognito began {{displaying}} the behavioral problems {{that would follow}} him throughout his career. During a practice early in the 2002 season, he hit walk-on lineman Jack Limbaugh from behind, prompting Limbaugh <b>to</b> <b>stomp</b> off the field in disgust. During his second game, against Troy State, {{he was accused of}} spitting on a Troy State player. Two weeks later, he was ejected for picking a fight in a blowout loss to Penn State. Per NCAA rules, he had to sit out {{the first half of the}} Huskers' next game, against Iowa State. In the second-to-last game of the season, against Colorado, he was flagged for a 15-yard personal foul penalty late in the game that largely contributed to the Huskers losing to the Buffaloes.|$|E
50|$|Advantages of the {{thresher}} include less physical labour {{and more}} efficiency (amount of grain thresher per amount of time).

Jasmine's character is hiding in a pot for her level therefore the player can hide and hop.|$|R

25|$|Moose often show {{aggression}} {{to other}} animals as well; especially predators. Bears are common predators of moose calves and, rarely, adults. Alaskan moose {{have been reported}} to successfully fend off attacks from black bears, brown bears and grizzlies. Moose have been known <b>to</b> <b>stomp</b> attacking wolves, which makes them less preferred as prey to the wolves. Moose are fully capable of killing bears and wolves. A moose of either sex that is confronted by danger may let out a loud roar, more resembling that of a predator than a prey animal. European moose are often more aggressive than North American moose, such as the moose in Sweden, which often become very agitated {{at the sight of a}} predator. However, like all ungulates known to attack predators, the more aggressive individuals are always darker in color.|$|E
25|$|The ninth {{match was}} a Bra and Panties match between Torrie Wilson and Stacy Keibler, and Trish Stratus and Lita with Mick Foley as the special guest referee. The match started with Lita and Stratus taking down Keibler and Wilson. Wilson dropkicked Stratus' back, and kicked {{her in the}} corner. Stratus fought back with a clothesline, and {{attempted}} to remove Wilson's shirt after a suplex. Keibler stopped her, and they attempted to double team, but Stratus performed a double clothesline. Lita tagged in, knocked Wilson off the apron, and removed Keibler's shirt after pulling her in. Keibler went outside the ring, and Lita chased after her. This allowed Wilson <b>to</b> <b>stomp</b> on Lita, and Keibler removed her shirt. Lita fought back with a snapmare, and attempted a diving crossbody. Wilson and Stratus tagged in, and performed a clothesline. Wilson fought back, and pulled Stratus up while stepping on her hair. She pulled down her top, but Stratus performed a roll-up, and removed Wilson's pants. Lita and Stratus then performed a Poetry in Motion, with Lita performing an aided clothesline to Wilson, before removing Wilson's shirt. Stratus then performed a bulldog to Keibler, and Lita performed a Litasault. They then removed Keibler's pants to win the match.|$|E

The organisation, at the time, adopted the [...] "open guard rule," [...] allowing fighters <b>to</b> <b>stomp</b> on each other. At {{the end of the third}} round, the fight was declared a draw, despite Mann feeling that he had the better of the fight, after a knockdown in the first round and a triangle choke attempt in the second round.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} article was published, an agent {{suggested}} that Ortved write a full book. They put together a proposal and shopped it to several publishers, before being signed by Faber and Faber. According to Ortved, [...] "When word of this got out, Brooks {{sent a letter to}} every current Simpsons employee, and all the former ones he thought mattered, asking them not to speak to me. The writers’ agents sent denial after denial for interview requests and eventually stopped responding altogether." [...] He added, [...] "There was one 'D'oh!' in James L. Brooks and the Gracie Films master plan: Many people don’t like James L. Brooks. [...] The book I ended up writing quotes more than 75 sources—some of them Simpsons staffers, former and current, who opened up because they considered his and Matt Groening’s attempt <b>to</b> <b>stomp</b> on my project very 'un-Simpsons.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Charles McDougall, his first credit for the series. According to Kinsey, McDougal, in order to set the characters' moods, would start every scene by saying [...] "everyone happy, Angela pissed!" [...] McDougal sought to bring movement to the Secret Santa scene, due to it being a largely stationary sequence. The cold opening was shot four different times, and almost every time, the ceiling tile that Michael displaces with a tree [...] "crashed through the ceiling and almost killed Steve Carell". The scene wherein Angela starts crying when the Christmas party descends into chaos {{was based on a}} deleted scene from the earlier season two episode [...] "The Fire", where Angela starts crying during a talking head due to the stress of the situation. The scenes featuring snow were created by a company that specialized in producing fake snow. Daniels was initially worried that the shots would look fake, but he was pleased with the final results. According to Fischer, {{on the last day of}} shooting, the cast had a snowball fight—a scene that is included in the episode—which she called a [...] "magic moment". Fischer later recounted that the prop egg nog and pigs in a blanket were kept out for three straight days, an act that she felt was revolting. In order to make her scenes more real Phyllis Smith forced herself to cry for [...] "30 minutes" [...] between takes. Many of the cast members asked her what was wrong, but Smith refused to speak to them, in order to stay in character. The series' writers researched local Pennsylvania laws and discovered one that states a liquor salesman must wear a tie. Thus, the show features a liquor store worker wearing a tie. Several of the scenes were improvised on the spot. During the sequence where Angela angrily throws Christmas bulbs at a wall, Angela Kinsey was unable to get them to break, so she decided <b>to</b> <b>stomp</b> on them. Kate Flannery improvised her line about not drinking only during the week while she was filming her talking head.|$|E

2500|$|Sally was {{diagnosed}} with type 1 diabetes in 1948. He wore an eye patch and had two prosthetic legs, which caused him to be widely referred to as [...] "Professor Pirate," [...] and [...] "The Math Pirate" [...] around the University of Chicago campus. [...] He was known to detest cell phones in class and has destroyed several {{over the years by}} inviting students <b>to</b> <b>stomp</b> on them or by throwing them out of a window.|$|E
2500|$|In 1875, French married Isabella Soundy, the {{daughter}} of a tradesman. Subalterns of that era were not expected to marry and French's first marriage may well have been kept secret from his regiment: his regiment is recorded incorrectly on the marriage certificate as [...] "12th Hussars", a regiment that did not exist at the time. They divorced in 1878 with Isabella as a co-respondent and said to have been paid off by French's wealthy brother-in-law, John Lydall. [...] The divorce could have ruined his career if widely known. Lydall had already paid off French's debts on a previous occasion, and later broke off relations with him when he attempted to borrow money again. [...] Later still, when French's name was seen on newspaper headlines (most likely during the Curragh incident), he was observed <b>to</b> <b>stomp</b> off down the street muttering [...] "sorry fellow, Jack French".|$|E
2500|$|Cheney later {{stated that}} he was trying to prove to critics that The Living End were not a band simply defined by their hit, [...] "Prisoner of Society", and the album showed this by {{displaying}} other influences, as well as their traditional fast-paced rockabilly music. Rolling Stone Jenny Eiscu compared it to The Clash's creative breakthrough, London Calling (December 1979), as they [...] "stomp all over the boundaries between punk, reggae, rockabilly and plain old rock & roll – and it still sounds like a revelation, twenty-two years after he Clash did it. The pupils don't quite outpace the masters here ... But the band is obviously having such a riotously good time that you'd be a sucker not <b>to</b> <b>stomp</b> your foot and join the party". Much of the style was comparable to 1980s hard rock and pub rock, as well as many tracks being obscure mixes of many ideas, resulting in 'procrastinating' structures. This defined the album's creativity.|$|E

2500|$|During John Howard's time {{as prime}} minister, Keating made {{occasional}} speeches strongly criticising his successor's social policies, and defending his own policies, {{such as those}} on East Timor. Keating described Howard as a [...] "desiccated coconut" [...] who was [...] "Araldited to the seat", and described him as [...] "... an old antediluvian 19th century person who wanted <b>to</b> <b>stomp</b> forever ... on ordinary people's rights to organise themselves at work ... he's a pre-Copernican obscurantist" [...] when criticising Howard's controversial WorkChoices policy. He described Howard's deputy, Peter Costello, as being [...] "all tip and no iceberg" [...] when referring to an alleged pact made by Howard to hand the leadership over to Costello after two terms. After Labor's landslide victory at the 2007 election, Keating {{said that he was}} relieved, rather than happy, that the Howard government had been removed. He claimed that there was [...] "relief that the nation had put itself back on course...relief that the toxicity of the Liberal social agenda, the active disparagement of particular classes and groups, that feeling of alienation in your own country, was over." ...|$|E
2500|$|The American {{historian}} Louise Young {{noted that}} one of the most striking aspects of Manchukuo was that many of the young Japanese civil servants who went to work in Manchukuo were on the left, or at least had once been. In the 1920s, much of the younger intelligentsia in Japan had rejected their parents' values, and had become active in various left-wing movements. Starting with the Peace Preservation Law of 1925, which made the very act of thinking about [...] "altering the kokutai" [...] a crime, the government had embarked on a sustained campaign <b>to</b> <b>stomp</b> out all left-wing thought in Japan. However, many of the bright young university graduates active in left-wing movements in Japan were needed to serve as civil servants in Manchukuo, which Young noted led the Japanese state to embark upon a contradictory policy of recruiting the same people active in the movements that it was seeking to crush. To rule Manchukuo, which right from the start had a very etatist economy, the Japanese state needed university graduates who were fluent in Mandarin Chinese, and the 1920s-30s, many of the university graduates in Japan who knew Mandarin were [...] "progressives" [...] involved in left-wing causes. The fact that young Japanese civil servants in Manchukuo with their degrees in economics, sociology, etc, who had once been active in left-wing movements helps explains the decidedly leftist thrust of social and economic policies in Manchukuo with the state playing an increasingly large role in society. Likewise, much of the debate between Japanese civil servants about the sort of social-economic policies Japan should follow in Manchukuo in the 1930s was framed in Marxist terms, with the civil servants arguing over whatever Manchuria prior to September 1931 had a [...] "feudal" [...] or a [...] "capitalist" [...] economy. The American historian Joshua Fogel wrote about the young servants of Manchuko: [...] "Tremendous debates transpired on such things as the nature of the Chinese economy, and the lingua franca of these debates was always Marxism". To resolve this debate, various research teams of five or six young civil servants, guarded by detachments from the Kwantung Army of about 20 or 30 men, went out to do field research in Manchukuo, gathering material about the life of ordinary people, to determine Manchukuo was in the [...] "feudal" [...] or [...] "capitalist" [...] stage of development. Starting in 1936, the Machukuo state launched Five Year Plans for economic development, which were closely modeled after the Five Year Plans in the Soviet Union.|$|E
