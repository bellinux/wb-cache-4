5|$|A {{scheme for}} an {{extension}} of the Avon Navigation was proposed in 1766, but canals did not reach the coalfield for almost another 50 years. In 1794 coal proprietors formed a committee to construct the Somerset Coal Canal with two branches into the Cam Brook and Wellow Brook Valleys, and from a junction at Midford, to join the proposed Kennet and Avon Canal at the Dundas Aqueduct near Bath. Coal was transported by the Somerset Coal Canal and later by the Bristol and North Somerset Railway and Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, which were accessed from the pits by a series of tramways. After 1854, when the first railway line was opened, the <b>tonnage</b> <b>carried</b> by the coal canal declined rapidly.|$|E
25|$|Bin Hai 293 {{was sold}} for {{breaking}} in late 2016. At the time, the vessel originally {{built for the}} Canadian Arctic had spent {{more than half of}} her 34-year-long career in the Bohai Sea under the Chinese flag. The decision to scrap the old icebreaker was likely related to the large fleet renewal program, which included ice-strengthened <b>tonnage,</b> <b>carried</b> out by China Oilfield Services.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{volumes of}} imports from Asia, which {{previously}} landed on U.S. West Coast ports, are now {{passing through the}} canal to the American East Coast. The total number of ocean-going transits increased from 11,725 in 2003 to 13,233 in 2007, falling to 12,855 in 2009. (The canal's fiscal year runs from October through September.) This has been coupled with a steady rise in average ship size and {{in the numbers of}} Panamax vessels passing through the canal, so that the total <b>tonnage</b> <b>carried</b> rose from 227.9 million PC/UMS tons in fiscal year 1999 to a then record high of 312.9 million tons in 2007, and falling to 299.1 million tons in 2009. Tonnage for fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015 was 320.6, 326.8 and 340.8 million PC/UMS tons carried on 13,660, 13,481 and 13,874 transits respectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tonnages</b> <b>carried</b> {{exceeded}} expectations, at over 58,000 tons {{annually and}} the company was financially very successful, with annual profits of over £2,000. Additional passing places were installed in 1831 and the wharves at Devoran were much extended.|$|R
50|$|In 1840 profits fell by 20%, {{though with}} {{increased}} <b>tonnages</b> <b>carried,</b> reflecting the downward pressure of rates. In the following year, a severe winter led to great difficulties with {{displacement of the}} stone blocks, and with embankment subsidence, costing considerable expenditure on repairs.|$|R
25|$|The {{ship had}} a {{deadweight}} <b>tonnage,</b> or <b>carrying</b> capacity, of approximately 81,000 tons, a measurement that {{put it at}} the small end of the Aframax class of tankers, smaller than most carriers of crude oil but larger than most carriers of refined products. It was classed by the American Bureau of Shipping and insured by the London Steam-Ship Owners' Mutual Insurance Association, a shipowners' mutual known as the London Club.|$|R
500|$|The {{completion}} of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894 transformed Partington into a major coal-exporting port. The canal was widened to [...] for three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) {{to allow for the}} construction of a coaling basin, equipped with four hydraulic coal hoists. Partington was the nearest port to the Lancashire Coalfields, and brought the south Yorkshire collieries [...] closer to the sea. Between 1898–1911, exports of coal accounted for 53.4 per cent of the total export <b>tonnage</b> <b>carried</b> by the ship canal. The coal trade in turn resulted in Partington becoming a major railway depot, and attracted a range of other industries, including the Partington Steel & Iron Company, which was encouraged by the availability of coal to construct a steelworks. The works became a part of the Lancashire Steel Corporation in 1930, and dominated the economy of nearby Irlam until their closure in 1976. After the Second World War, Partington was extended as an overspill estate.|$|E
500|$|Trade {{steadily}} grew. Three {{small private}} branches were built {{to serve the}} industries of the valley. Near {{the top of the}} canal, a branch was constructed in 1800, which ran towards Maesmarchog, and was connected to collieries by nearly [...] of tramroad. At Aberclwyd, a branch built in 1817 served the Cnel Bach limekiln on the river bank. Below Neath, a [...] branch left the main line at Court Sart to connect to a tramroad serving the collieries at Eskyn. Although there are no figures for the <b>tonnage</b> <b>carried,</b> apart from a mention of 90,000 tons of coal in 1810, receipts increased from £2,117 in 1800 to £6,677 in 1830. Subscribers had paid a total of £107.50 for their shares, and dividends were paid from 1806, rising from £2 in 1806 to £18 in 1840. Based on the receipts, {{it has been estimated that}} some 200,000 tons of coal were carried when trade was at its peak, supplemented by iron, ironstone and fire clay.|$|E
2500|$|In 1829, the {{government}} agreed to transfer both the ship canal and the Newry Canal {{to a private}} company, whose chairman was the Marquess of Downshire. The Directors General objected, as {{they had not been}} consulted, and felt that it was wrong to transfer an undertaking that had been built using public money to a private company. However, the company agreed to spend £80,000 on improvements over the following twenty years, and kept their word. By 1850, a new sea lock had been built, some [...] further down the estuary, which doubled the size of ships that could use it. The river had been dredged, and the Albert Basin had been constructed at Newry. The Newry Canal also benefitted, with receipts rising to £3,500 per year, resulting from the <b>tonnage</b> <b>carried</b> doubling to over 100,000 tons per year.|$|E
50|$|Many notable {{sea canals}} were {{completed}} in this period, {{starting with the}} Suez Canal (1869) - which <b>carries</b> <b>tonnage</b> many times that of most other canals - and the Kiel Canal (1897), though the Panama Canal was not opened until 1914.|$|R
50|$|During {{fiscal year}} 1902, there were 246 lockages transiting 48,240 {{registered}} <b>tonnage</b> of vessels, <b>carrying</b> 3,455 tons of freight, including 571 tons {{of sand and}} gravel shipped in to repair the locks. The railroads however lowered their rates to compete, and kept most of the shipping business.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the Great Eastern Railway (GER), wishing {{to compete with}} its rivals who were {{operating}} from the Kent coast to France and Belgium, obtained the rights to provide a cargo and cattle service to Rotterdam. After first using chartered <b>tonnage</b> they <b>carried</b> passengers with the paddle steamer Zealous 613 gt, built in 1864 on the Thames by J & W Dudgeon. Dudgeon also supplied the 1865 built Avalon, 670 gt, which was powered by a two-cylinder oscillating engine that gave a speed of 14 knots.|$|R
2500|$|With {{the threat}} of the {{railways}} taking trade from the canals, the Don Navigation Company decided to purchase the Barnsley Canal, and to lease the Dearne and Dove for a year, after which they would buy it. The agreement with the Dearne and Dove went ahead, with the River Don Navigation taking over the canal from 1 January 1846, and paying £210,000 for it on 2 January 1847, but they failed to reach agreement with the Barnsley Canal. Tolls were reduced by 60 per cent in 1846, with free passage for empty boats from 1847, with the result that much of the coal traffic which had previously used the Barnsley Canal now used the Dearne and Dove. The South Yorkshire, Doncaster & Goole Railway Company was authorised in 1847, and the Act of Parliament allowed them to amalgamate with the Don Navigation Company, and hence the Dearne and Dove, once they had raised half of their authorised capital. The amalgamation took place on 19 April 1850. The railway company opened their line from Doncaster to Swinton in November 1849, which was followed by a branch to Elsecar in February 1850, and another branch to Worsbrough in June 1850. At Elsecar, the canal basin was moved, and about [...] of the canal were filled in {{to make way for the}} railway. While the takeover was beneficial to traffic on parts of the Don Navigation, <b>tonnage</b> <b>carried</b> on the Dearne and Dove fell.|$|E
6000|$|The {{functions}} performed by railways {{in the system}} of production is [...] highly important. They {{are among the most}} influential causes [...] affecting the cost of producing commodities, particularly those [...] which satisfy the primary wants of man, of which food is the [...] chief. The amount of <b>tonnage</b> <b>carried</b> is enormous; and the cost of [...] this service to the producers and consumers of the United States [...] is a question of very great magnitude. The serious reduction in [...] the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to [...] all who have not followed the matter very closely; the more so, [...] that it has been brought about by natural causes, and independent [...] of legislation. Corn, meat, and dairy products form, it is said, [...] at least 50 per cent, and coal and timber about 30 per cent, of [...] the tonnage moved on all the railways of the United States. If a [...] lowered cost of transportation has come about, it has then cost [...] less to move the main articles of immediate necessity. Had the [...] charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869, [...] the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the United [...] States from $500,000,000 to $800,000,000 more than the charge [...] actually made, owing to the reductions by the railways. It seems, [...] however, that this process of reduction culminated about 1879. In [...] order to show the facts of this process, note the changes in the [...] following chart, No. V. The railways of the State of New York are [...] taken, but the same is also true of those of Ohio: ...|$|E
50|$|Annual <b>tonnage</b> <b>carried</b> for {{the years}} 1913 to 1926 {{inclusive}} 29,062 tons.|$|E
2500|$|This {{resulted}} in a top-heavy design, with severe stability problems, and the weight-control measures used by designers to fit as much armament as possible onto a ship of a given <b>tonnage</b> were <b>carried</b> to an extreme, which further contributed to the structural weaknesses of the ships of this period. This was graphically demonstrated when the torpedo boat [...] capsized in 1934 during heavy seas (the [...] "Tomozuru Incident") and when a typhoon ripped the bows off two Fubuki-class destroyers (the [...] "IJN 4th Fleet Incident") in 1935. As {{a result of these}} two incidents the Hatsuharu-class vessels had to be rebuilt (the first two completed had to be rebuilt twice) or modified while building to remedy their stability problems.|$|R
5000|$|Large {{volumes of}} goods were being shipped locally, in {{contrast}} to the canal's original purpose of transshipping imports to the Midlands. The opening of the London and Birmingham Railway in 1838 actually increased the <b>tonnage</b> of coal <b>carried</b> by the canal. However, by 1929, with the Midlands trade lost to the railways, and more deliveries made by road, the canal [...] - [...] and this basin [...] - [...] fell into a long decline.|$|R
25|$|During the 20th century, the Port of Duluth {{was for a}} {{time the}} busiest port in the United States, surpassing even New York City in gross <b>tonnage.</b> Lake freighters <b>carried</b> iron ore through the Great Lakes to {{processing}} plants in Illinois and Ohio. Ten newspapers, six banks and an 11-story skyscraper, the Torrey Building, were founded and built. As of 1905, Duluth {{was said to be}} home to the most millionaires per capita in the United States.|$|R
50|$|The annual <b>tonnage</b> <b>carried</b> {{increased}} {{more than}} eight-fold following the Nottingham Corporation assumption of control of part of the Trent Navigation.|$|E

50|$|International {{shipping}} to {{and from}} the Maldives is mainly operated by the private sector with {{only a small fraction of}} the <b>tonnage</b> <b>carried</b> on vessels operated by the national carrier, Maldives Shipping Management Ltd.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are plans}} for an iron ore railway, which however might be {{isolated}} from existing railways. The distance from the mine to the nearest likely port is about 500 km as the crow flies. A connection to the nearest Camrail line at Mbalmayo on the Nyong River would be 350 km long. Because of the heavy <b>tonnages</b> to be <b>carried,</b> this railway {{is likely to be}} [...] (standard gauge). The railway would run from mines near Mbalam to a port near Lolabe. The expected traffic is 35 million tonnes per year for 25 years.|$|R
50|$|The City Road Basin, {{the nearest}} to the City of London, soon eclipsed the Paddington Basin {{in the amount}} of goods carried, principally coal and {{building}} materials. These were goods that were being shipped locally, in contrast to the canal's original purpose of transshipping imports to the Midlands. The opening of the London and Birmingham Railway in 1838 actually increased the <b>tonnage</b> of coal <b>carried</b> by the canal. However, by the early twentieth century, with the Midland trade lost to the railways, and more deliveries made by road, the canal had fallen into a long decline.|$|R
50|$|Rather than run it down, the Great Western Railway ran {{the canal}} well, and it {{remained}} profitable until 1895, when losses were first reported, though it recovered a little between 1898 and 1902. The <b>tonnage</b> of coal <b>carried</b> on the canal was very high, with 385,000 tons transported down the canal to Swansea in 1888 alone. The last commercial cargo {{carried on the}} Swansea Canal was in 1931, when coal was conveyed from Clydach to Swansea. Boats continued to operate on the canal after that date but only for maintenance work, with horse-drawn boats last recorded at Clydach in 1958.|$|R
50|$|The Canal du Centre {{was opened}} to boats with a {{displacement}} of 1,350 tonnes in September 2002. Between 2000 and 2004 the annual ship transits increased from 1,531 to 4,041 while the <b>tonnage</b> <b>carried</b> increased from 282,000 to 1,513,000.|$|E
50|$|Bulk cargo {{constitutes}} {{the majority of}} <b>tonnage</b> <b>carried</b> by most freight railroads. Bulk cargo is commodity cargo that is transported unpackaged in large quantities. These cargo are usually dropped or poured, with a spout or shovel bucket, as a liquid or solid, into a railroad car. Liquids, such as petroleum and chemicals, and compressed gases are carried by rail in tank cars.|$|E

50|$|Britannia was a {{large ship}} for the period, 207 feet (63 m) long and 34 feet (10.3 m) across the beam, with three masts. She had paddle wheels and her {{two-cylinder}} side-lever engine (from Robert Napier) had a power output of about 740 indicated horsepower. She was relatively fast for the time: her usual speed was about 8.5 kn, but she could do better if the winds and currents were favourable. She had a <b>tonnage,</b> or <b>carrying</b> capacity, of 1,154 tons (by the Builder's Old Measurement). She was capable of carrying 115 passengers with a crew of 82. On her maiden voyage, starting on 4 July 1840, she made Halifax, Nova Scotia, from Liverpool, England, in 12 days and 10 hours, continuing on to Boston, Massachusetts. The Britannia transported numerous types of cargo alongside its passengers. The cargo included 600 tons of coal; mail due across the Atlantic; livestock for food and milk; and cats to control the rat population. There were 115 first class passengers, with 89 crew members on board.|$|R
50|$|The SS Catalonia {{was built}} in 1881 in Glasgow by J. & G. Thomson & Co. The Cunard Line {{returned}} the SS Abyssinia after its last voyage in 1880 as payment toward {{the building of the}} SS Catalonia and the SS Servia. SS Catalonia launched on May 14, 1881 and took its maiden voyage on August 6 from Liverpool to Queenstown to New York City. Until 1899, the ship operated between Liverpool and Boston, with the exception of two other trips to New York (besides the maiden voyage). The ship measured 429.6 feet by 43 feet with 4,481 gross <b>tonnage</b> and could <b>carry</b> 200 first-class passengers and 1,500 third-class passengers.|$|R
5000|$|The Lamco Railway {{was built}} as a single track [...] {{standard}} gauge line, and had eight intermediate stations with passing loops. It {{was one of the}} first iron ore railways to be designed specifically for use by long trains, and to be fitted with modern aids to operation, including centrally controlled signalling. Trains on the Lamco Railway were normally made up of three [...] locomotives hauling ninety ore cars. When loaded, they carried a total of 10530 LT of ore. As at 1980, the maximum <b>tonnage</b> of ore <b>carried</b> was 13000000 LT per annum, and the rolling stock fleet comprised 14 locomotives and 510 ore cars.|$|R
50|$|The B&GlosR {{company had}} opened its line in 1835, and this {{resulted}} in considerable abstraction from the A&GR line <b>tonnage</b> <b>carried</b> had reduced to less than half. Suggestions were made of improper favouritism of the B&GlosR line as the destination for coal produced, although the reduction may simply {{have been the result}} of a cheaper route to market. The A&GR reduced some tonnage rates, and inevitably their income suffered.|$|E
50|$|Rail freight, {{which is}} cheaper—only {{roughly half the}} cost of road transport—safer, and more environmentally-friendly than road transport, {{accounted}} for only 1.4 percent of freight <b>tonnage</b> <b>carried</b> in 2015. SRT aims to boost its share of cargo transport to six percent with its double track expansion by 2022. Expansion of SRT's freight service, which could earn more money than the heavily subsidized passenger service, has been neglected for decades in favour of Thailand's roads.|$|E

50|$|In August 1948, 10 C-54s {{arrived in}} Germany to begin airlift service. In addition, {{civilian}} DC-4s were loaned to the Air Force for airlift duty. The United States Navy provided 21 R-5Ds, {{their version of}} the C-54 as well. The airfields at Rhein-Main and Wiesbaden began to fill to capacity with planes, and {{the decision was made}} to also use Royal Air Force airfields at Celle and Faßberg. The U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, and the British Royal Air Force together airlifted more than 2.3 million tons of food, fuel and medical supplies. Most of the <b>tonnage</b> was <b>carried</b> by the U.S. Air Force. The Berlin Airlift taxed existing USAF resources of cargo aircraft, aircraft engines, skilled aircrews, and maintenance personnel.Strategic Air Command reassessed its B-29 forward deployments after the Berlin crisis arose. After initial forward deployments to Goose Bay Air Base in Newfoundland, and consideration of basing the bombers in Germany, it was decided to send them to Royal Air Force bases in Britain where they would be less vulnerable. The 28th and 307th Bombardment Groups were deployed to the newly activated station at RAF Marham.|$|R
500|$|Writing in 2012, {{historian}} Robert C. Stern {{stated that}} it is difficult to determine how many ships were sunk during Operation Leader as some of the vessels which were run ashore were possibly refloated and repaired. He assessed that five ships (Cap Guir, La Plata, Rabat, Skramstad and Vaagan) were probably destroyed, with these vessels having a total of approximately 19,000 gross register <b>tonnage</b> of <b>carrying</b> capacity. In contrast, Norwegian sources pre-dating Stern's claims by decades state that two ships (Rabat and Vaagan) were sunk, and three ships (La Plata, Skramstad and Topeka) were damaged beyond repair. The German naval historian Jürgen Rohwer also lists the ships destroyed by aircraft in Operation Leader as La Plata, Rabat, Skramstad, Topeka, and Vaagan. Cap Guir, assessed by Stern as probably destroyed, is listed by Rohwer as having survived the damage inflicted by the American aircraft at Bodø. The ship was eventually sunk by Soviet torpedo bombers in the Baltic in April 1945. In his 1974 book Deutschlands Handelsschiffe 1939–1945, the German maritime historian [...] gives the same list as Rohwer for German ships destroyed in Operation Leader. Schwadtke states that La Plata and Rabat were the German vessels lost off the Bodø area on 4 October 1943, and lists Cap Guir as sunk in 1945.|$|R
25|$|The VOC {{existed for}} almost 200 years from its {{founding}} in 1602, when the States-General of the Netherlands granted it a 21-year monopoly over Dutch operations in Asia until its demise in 1796. During those two centuries (between 1602 and 1796), the VOC sent almost a million Europeans {{to work in the}} Asia trade on 4,785 ships, and netted for their efforts more than 2.5 million tons of Asian trade goods. By contrast, the rest of Europe combined sent only 882,412 people from 1500 to 1795, and the fleet of the English (later British) East India Company, the VOC's nearest competitor, was a distant second to its total traffic with 2,690 ships and a mere one-fifth the <b>tonnage</b> of goods <b>carried</b> by the VOC. The VOC enjoyed huge profits from its spice monopoly through most of the 17th century.|$|R
