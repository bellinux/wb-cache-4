5|$|As {{a result}} of her {{suffrage}} and publishing work, Gordon was well-known in California political circles, and even received 200 votes for State Senate in 1871. This positioned her, along with fellow suffragette Clara Shortridge Foltz, to manage the lobbying campaign for the Woman Lawyer's Bill, which granted women the right to practice law in California in January 1878.

Two goals from Robin van Persie, after Liverpool had scored {{in the first half}} meant that Liverpool lost 2–1 and were 10 points behind the team in 4th place, which would ensure {{qualification}} for the UEFA Champions League the following season. Liverpool's league form continued to falter {{after the final}}; they won four of their last thirteen matches and ended the season in eighth place. Despite their poor league form, Liverpool reached the final of the FA Cup against Chelsea. But they were unable to win a second trophy and lost 2–1. Cardiff played West Ham United in their first match after the final, which they lost 2–0. Despite the loss, they only needed to win one more in their remaining thirteen matches to finish in 6th place and qualify for the Championship playoffs. They faced third placed West Ham United, in the playoffs, which were contested over two-legs, with one at each team's home ground. Cardiff were unable to secure a second Wembley final, as West Ham United won 5–0 on aggregate.|$|E

Our two-stage study of 18 - to 25 -year-old college students {{suggests that many}} of the advertising dollars consumer goods firms spend on Facebook are likely wasted. This study highlights that, <b>in</b> addition <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with friends and relatives, Facebook users are primarily motivated by three desires: (1) to voyeuristically peer into others’ lives, (2) to create a distinctive identity for themselves, and (3) to act on their inner narcissistic tendencies. These motivations also make them poor prospects for advertisers, as users seem disinterested in Facebook ads and disengaged from marketers’ attempts to build brands. Herein, we discuss challenges for marketers, as well as opportunities for building brands and driving sales via Facebook...|$|R

25|$|The {{attempt to}} prove that Hitler had a fully {{developed}} psychosis in a clinical sense has only occasionally been made. An example is the book Hitler, Steiner, Schreber (1966) by the Freiburg psychiatrist Wolfgang Treher. Treher explains that both Rudolf Steiner (whose anthroposophy he attributes to mental illness) and Hitler suffered from schizophrenia. He writes that both managed <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with reality because they {{had the opportunity to}} create their own organizations (Steiner: the Anthroposophical Society; Hitler: the NSDAP and its many subdivisions) that they could influence according to their delusions – and therefore avoid the, normally expected, “schizophrenic withdrawal”.

25|$|A two-year Massey University {{survey of}} 30,000 people, {{published}} in 2003, indicated 50 percent of Māori in Iwi Radio Network broadcast areas listened to an iwi station. The results {{were consistent with}} those of similar surveys by individual stations, and countered the misconception that iwi stations reached small and specific audiences. According to the research, iwi stations were often associated with old music and interviews with elders, but many Māori listeners used it <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with their culture, family history, spirituality and community, and maintain their language skills. Further Auckland University of Technology research in 2009 suggested the potential audience of iwi radio stations would increase due to the growth of New Zealand's Māori and Pacific population.|$|E

When I applied to physics and visited Caltech, I took a break to wander over to Robinson Hall and meet some astronomers. Richard Ellis happened to be in his office, door ajar. This was very lucky for me. I left amazed by the breadth of interesting projects he was working on and his pure excitement about everything. (I also got a reprint of the Nature cover by Richard Massey, which looked really cool.) That enthusiasm was the main reason I came to Caltech. Being Richard’s student is truly a privilege. I’m thankful that he’s been such an excellent mentor, always supportive and available to talk or read a paper draft, and inspiring in his depth and versatility as a scientist. Richard taught me to focus on the important things: keep the big picture in mind, always work on questions that are interesting, and remember to have fun doing it. I owe so much to Tommaso Treu for his guidance over the last five years. Tommaso was always there to talk, brainstorm, encourage me, and give great advice (and not only about science—also where to eat in seemingly any city!). Throughout he’s been unfailingly positive. Looking back, I realize how much of my perspective on science comes from him. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the humor and hospitality of Tommaso and his wife, Stefania Tutino, and look forward <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch...</b>|$|R
