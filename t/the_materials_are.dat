25|$|The {{materials}} {{used to make}} the baskets—including but not limited to, swamp canes, saguaro cactuses, rye grass, black ash, willow shoots, sedge roots, the bark of redbud, the root of bulrush, and the root of the gray pine—were harvested annually. After being picked, <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> dried, cleaned, split, soaked, and dyed. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> also boiled over a fire and set in the sun to dry.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> said to {{be taken}} almost wholly from Aristotle's Meteorologica, {{from the work of}} Theophrastus, On Weather Signs, and from Hesiod. Nothing is said in either poem about Hellenistic astrology.|$|E
25|$|Impurities usually {{enter the}} solder {{reservoir}} by dissolving the metals {{present in the}} assemblies being soldered. Dissolving of process equipment is not common as <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> usually chosen to be insoluble in solder.|$|E
50|$|The {{polarity}} of this Hall voltage indicates <b>the</b> type of <b>material</b> <b>the</b> sample <b>is</b> made of; if it <b>is</b> positive, <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> P-type, {{and if it}} <b>is</b> negative, <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> N-type.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that before}} the thermal arrest <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> a liquid and after it <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> a solid; during the thermal arrest <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> {{converting}} from a liquid to a solid. Also, note that the greater the superheat the more time there <b>is</b> for <b>the</b> liquid <b>material</b> to flow into intricate details.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>materials</b> <b>were</b> closed until 2003, {{when they}} were opened to public access. In 2012, a {{substantial}} portion of <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>were</b> made available online.|$|R
25|$|The {{structural}} elements guiding the systemic forces through <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> not only {{such as a}} connecting rod, a truss, a beam, or a column, but also a cable, an arch, a cavity or channel, and even an angle, a surface structure, or a frame.|$|E
25|$|About 80 {{percent of}} <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> re-used, {{including}} 16,000 tons {{of steel and}} 1,200 tons of copper from the power cars' traction motors. Compared to buying new trains, the program saves about 1.3 billion Euro. About 35,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions were avoided as well as about 500,000 tons of industrial waste.|$|E
25|$|Specialty polyols include {{polycarbonate}} polyols, polycaprolactone polyols, polybutadiene polyols, and polysulfide polyols. <b>The</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> used in elastomer, sealant, and adhesive {{applications that}} require superior weatherability, {{and resistance to}} chemical and environmental attack. Natural oil polyols derived from castor oil and other vegetable oils are used to make elastomers, flexible bunstock, and flexible molded foam.|$|E
2500|$|ΔL is {{the amount}} by which {{the length of the}} object changes (ΔL <b>is</b> {{positive}} if <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> stretched , and negative when <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> compressed); ...|$|R
50|$|There are two {{mechanisms}} to generate waves through magnetic field interaction. One is Lorentz force when <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> conductive. <b>The</b> other <b>is</b> magnetostriction when <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> ferromagnetic.|$|R
50|$|According to the {{properties}} of <b>the</b> <b>material</b> that <b>are</b> used to modulate the light beam, modulators are divided into two groups: absorptive modulators and refractive modulators. In absorptive modulators the absorption coefficient of <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> changed, in refractive modulators the refractive index of <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> changed.|$|R
25|$|Filler metal (electrode material) {{improperly}} {{chosen for}} the environmental conditions can make them corrosion-sensitive as well. There are also issues of galvanic corrosion if the electrode composition is sufficiently dissimilar to the materials welded, or <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> dissimilar themselves. Even between different grades of nickel-based stainless steels, corrosion of welded joints can be severe, despite that they rarely undergo galvanic corrosion when mechanically joined.|$|E
25|$|ELC2 {{also carried}} MISSE-7, an {{experiment}} that will expose {{a variety of}} materials and coatings being considered for future spacecraft to the extreme conditions outside the space station. <b>The</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> being evaluated {{for the effects of}} atomic oxygen, ultraviolet, direct sunlight, radiation, and extremes of heat and cold. The experimental findings will benefit better understanding, development and to test new materials suitable to better withstand the rigors of space environments with applications in the design of future spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|MOFs are {{composed}} of two major components: a metal ion or cluster of metal ions and an organic molecule called a linker. For this reason, <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> {{often referred to as}} hybrid organic–inorganic materials; however, this terminology has recently been explicitly discouraged. The organic units are typically mono-, di-, tri-, or tetravalent ligands. The choice of metal and linker dictates the structure and hence properties of the MOF. For example, the metal's coordination preference influences {{the size and shape of}} pores by dictating how many ligands can bind to the metal and in which orientation.|$|E
50|$|When UHMWPE <b>is</b> annealed, <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> {{heated to}} 135 °C to 138 °C in an oven or a liquid bath of {{silicone}} oil or glycerine. <b>The</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> then cooled {{down at a}} rate of 5 °C/h to 65 °C or less. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> wrapped in an insulating blanket for 24 hours to bring to room temperature.|$|R
50|$|Heat resistance: <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> heat {{resistant}} up to 100 °C (212 °F), {{but can be}} damaged by excess heat. DuPont recommends the use of trivets when <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> installed in kitchens.|$|R
50|$|The name of <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> that of Worbla AG, {{a former}} {{synthetics}} manufacturer in Worblaufen, Switzerland, {{now part of}} the Gurit group. <b>The</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> marketed by <b>the</b> German company Cast4Art Vertriebsgesellschaft.|$|R
25|$|Among {{the most}} plunderable portables from the Etruscan tombs of Etruria are the finely {{engraved}} gemstones set in patterned gold to form circular or ovoid pieces intended {{to go on}} finger rings. Of the magnitude of one centimeter, they are dated to the Etruscan floruit from {{the second half of}} the sixth to the first centuries BC. The two main theories of manufacture are native Etruscan and Greek. <b>The</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> mainly dark red carnelian, with agate and sard entering usage from the third to the first centuries BC, along with purely gold finger rings with a hollow engraved bezel setting. The engravings, mainly cameo, but sometimes intaglio, depict scarabs at first and then scenes from Greek mythology, often with heroic personages called out in Etruscan. The gold setting of the bezel bears a border design, such as cabling.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} use emergy (spelled with an m) analysis, for example, {{budgets for}} the amount of energy of one kind (exergy) that is required to make or transform things into another kind of product or service. Emergy calculations take into account economics which can alter pure physics based results. Using emergy life-cycle analysis researchers have concluded that materials with large refining costs have the greatest potential for high recycle benefits. Moreover, the highest emergy efficiency accrues from systems geared toward material recycling, where materials are engineered to recycle back into their original form and purpose, followed by adaptive reuse systems where <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> recycled into a different kind of product, and then by-product reuse systems where parts of the products are used to make an entirely different product.|$|E
25|$|The {{work of the}} Archives of Republika Srpska {{comprises}} professional archival, cultural, administrative, {{research and}} service activities. It is regulated by the Law on Archival Activity (Zakon o arhivskoj djelatnosti) passed by the National Assembly of Republika Srpska, {{as well as by}} regulations and instructions issued by the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Government of Republika Srpska. According to the law, the Archives' mission is to collect, sort, process, research, preserve and protect public documentary and archival materials, as well as to publish and provide access to them. In this way, one of the tasks of the Archives is to protect both the interests of Republika Srpska and the personal rights of its individual citizens. The documentary and archival materials that the Archives collects come from legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government, public institutions, business organisations, civic associations, and other legal entities, as well as individuals, whose work and actions are considered to be of lasting importance for Republika Srpska in social, cultural, scientific, legal, and other matters. The sources of <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> called the creators and owners of archival materials, and they are divided into three groups regarding their importance for the society of Republika Srpska within their respective fields of activity. The Archives is entitled to supervise the protection of archival materials while they are still kept by their creators and owners, before their ultimate transfer to the Archives.|$|E
50|$|Below the Curie temperature, {{the atoms}} are aligned and parallel, causing {{spontaneous}} magnetism; <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> ferromagnetic. Above <b>the</b> Curie temperature <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> paramagnetic, as <b>the</b> atoms lose their ordered magnetic moments when <b>the</b> <b>material</b> undergoes a phase transition.|$|R
50|$|In bulk <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> semi-metallic, {{but as a}} {{monolayer}} it is a semiconductor. The conductivity of <b>the</b> bulk <b>material</b> <b>is</b> 620,000 S/m.|$|R
40|$|A <b>material</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} to absorb hydrogen during its production {{in a final}} repository. <b>The</b> absorption <b>material</b> consists of electrolytically prepared MnO$_{ 2 }$ catalytically activated by Ag$_{ 2 }$O. The preparation technique of <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>was</b> optimized. <b>The</b> kinetics of hydrogen absorption was investigated.

500|$|There are {{two main}} types of glass fiber {{manufacture}} and two main types of glass fiber product. [...] First, fiber is made either from a direct melt process or a marble remelt process. [...] Both start with the raw materials in solid form. [...] <b>The</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> mixed together and melted in a furnace. [...] Then, for the marble process, the molten material is sheared and rolled into marbles which are cooled and packaged. [...] The marbles are taken to the fiber manufacturing facility where they are inserted into a can and remelted. [...] The molten glass is extruded to the bushing to be formed into fiber. [...] In the direct melt process, the molten glass in the furnace goes directly to the bushing for formation.|$|E
500|$|The {{definition}} and the criteria {{have changed since}} {{the introduction of the}} term. These archaeological materials adhere to the current definition, and have been designated national treasures since the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties came into effect on June 9, 1951. The items are selected by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology based on their [...] "especially high historical or artistic value". The list presents 46 materials or sets of materials from ancient to feudal Japan, spanning a period from about 4,500BC to 1361AD. The actual number of items is more than 46 because groups of related objects have been combined into single entries. Most of the items have been excavated from tombs, kofun, sutra mounds or other archaeological sites. <b>The</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Lenses with {{different}} replacement schedules {{can be made}} of the same material. Although <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> alike, differences in the manufacturing processes determine if the resulting lens will be a [...] "daily disposable" [...] or one recommended for two or four week replacement. However, sometimes manufacturers use absolutely identical lenses and just repackage them {{with different}} labels.|$|E
5000|$|Złodzieje zapalniczek - Pidzama Porno's fourth studio album, {{released}} in 1997 by S.P. Records. <b>The</b> <b>material</b> <b>was</b> recorded in Studio CZAD in Swarzedz.

50|$|If χ <b>is</b> positive, a <b>material</b> can <b>be</b> para{{magnetic}}. In this case, {{the magnetic}} field in <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> strengthened by <b>the</b> induced magnetization. Alternatively, if χ <b>is</b> negative, <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> diamagnetic. In this case, {{the magnetic field}} in <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> weakened by <b>the</b> induced magnetization. Generally, non-magnetic <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> said to be para- or diamagnetic {{because they do not}} possess permanent magnetization without external magnetic field. Ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, or antiferromagnetic materials have positive susceptibility and possess permanent magnetization even without external magnetic field.|$|R
50|$|Below the Curie {{temperature}} {{the atoms}} of each ion are aligned anti-parallel with different momentums causing a spontaneous magnetism; <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> ferrimagnetic. Above <b>the</b> Curie temperature <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> paramagnetic as <b>the</b> atoms lose their ordered magnetic moments as <b>the</b> <b>material</b> undergoes a phase transition.|$|R
2500|$|Lower quality {{materials}} that use cheaper deposition processes are being researched as well. [...] These devices {{are not as}} efficient, but the price, size and power combined {{allow them to be}} just as cost effective. [...] Since the processes are simpler and <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> more readily available, the mass production of these devices is more economical.|$|E
2500|$|Most vinyl {{products}} contain plasticizers which dramatically {{improve their}} performance characteristic. The most common plasticizers are derivatives of phthalic acid. [...] <b>The</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> selected on their compatibility with the polymer, low volatility levels, and cost. [...] These materials are usually oily colourless substances that mix {{well with the}} PVC particles. About 90% of the plasticizer market, estimated to be millions of tons per year worldwide, is dedicated to PVC.|$|E
2500|$|Materials {{are made}} of atoms that are {{normally}} electrically neutral because they contain equal numbers of positive charges (protons in their nuclei) and negative charges (electrons in [...] "shells" [...] surrounding the nucleus). The phenomenon of static electricity requires a separation {{of positive and negative}} charges. When two materials are in contact, electrons may move from one material to the other, which leaves an excess of positive charge on one material, and an equal negative charge on the other. When <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> separated they retain this charge imbalance.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two basic}} {{categories}} of etching processes: wet etching and dry etching. In <b>the</b> former, <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> dissolved when immersed in a chemical solution.

30|$|The minimum UCT determines <b>the</b> <b>material</b> {{deformation}} {{and removal}} mechanism with {{a decrease of}} UCT. When the UCT is considerably larger than the minimum UCT, <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> removed by shearing mechanism. When the UCT is smaller than or similar as the minimum UCT, <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>is</b> removed by extruding. For further decreasing the UCT, rubbing happens and no <b>material</b> <b>is</b> removed.|$|R
