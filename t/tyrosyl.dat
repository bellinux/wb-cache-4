In the key steps of the {{catalytic cycle}}, a cooperative Brønsted-basic ligand-site deprotonates the alcohol, and subsequently the oxygen atom of the tyrosinyl radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alpha-CH functionality of the coordinated alkoxide substrate.

50|$|Two {{electrons}} {{are passed}} from two cytochrome c's, through the CuA and cytochrome a sites to the cytochrome a3- CuB binuclear center, reducing the metals to the Fe2+ form and Cu+. The hydroxide ligand is protonated and lost as water, creating a void between the metals that is filled by O2. The oxygen is rapidly reduced, with two electrons {{coming from the}} Fe2+cytochrome a3, which is converted to the ferryl oxo form (Fe4+=O). The oxygen atom close to CuB picks up one electron from Cu+, and a second electron and a proton from the hydroxyl of Tyr(244), which becomes a <b>tyrosyl</b> radical: The second oxygen is converted to a hydroxide ion by picking up two electrons and a proton. A third electron arising from another cytochrome c is passed through the first two electron carriers to the cytochrome a3- CuB binuclear center, and this electron and two protons convert the <b>tyrosyl</b> radical back to Tyr, and the hydroxide bound to CuB2+ to a water molecule. The fourth electron from another cytochrome c flows through CuA and cytochrome a to the cytochrome a3- CuB binuclear center, reducing the Fe4+=O to Fe3+, with the oxygen atom picking up a proton simultaneously, regenerating this oxygen as a hydroxide ion coordinated {{in the middle of}} the cytochrome a3- CuB center as it was at the start of this cycle. The net process is that four reduced cytochrome c's are used, along with 4 protons, to reduce O2 to two water molecules.|$|E

The degree of availability of the <b>tyrosyl</b> groups in native insulin, and of the 0 -acetyltyrosyl groups in the acetylated insulin was studied by the above kinetic studies. Two <b>tyrosyl</b> residues were acetylated at a rate sufficiently more fast than the remaining two so that a diacetyl derivative could be isolated. This preparation was fully active. The completely acetylated insulin was only thirty percent as active as native insulin in the mouse convulsion test. Native and acetylated insulin were inactivated by seventy percent on treatment with hydroxylamine. These and other findings lead to the conclusion that {{one or both of the}} slowly acetylated <b>tyrosyl</b> residues of insulin are involved in the mechanism of action of the hormone. In order to determine the location of the two acetylated <b>tyrosyl</b> residues, the diacetyl derivative of insulin was oxidized and the A and B chains isolated were assayed for acetyl groups. The diacetyl derivative was also digested separately with trypsin and chymotrypsin, and each core was also assayed for acetyl groups.
