5|$|Once he is released, Samuel {{returns to}} his {{ministry}} and attempts to heal {{a woman in a}} wheelchair. However, she suffers a seizure and dies, which leads to Samuel's second arrest. An autopsy reveals the woman died of cyanide poisoning, whilst Mulder and Scully find evidence that the swarm of locusts, which were actually common grasshoppers, was guided by someone to the courtroom through the building's ventilation system. Mulder believes Samuel <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>innocent.</b> However, the local sheriff, Maurice Daniels, allows two of his men to beat Samuel to death in his cell.|$|E
5|$|Catherine's father, Tom Miller (Ken Pogue), tells Black {{about two}} {{friends of his}} whose son was convicted of killing his wife. The father, C. R. Hunziger, is dying of {{pancreatic}} cancer, but maintains his distance from his son over the crime; his wife Adele, however, still believes her son <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>innocent.</b> Black visits the terminal Hunziger, hoping to change his mind, but the elderly man holds his position. Adele gives Black a folder full of documents relating to the case, which Black reviews. His knowledge of offender profiling leads him {{to believe that the}} convicted man, Malcom, is innocent; however the conviction was secured with a substantial level of physical evidence.|$|E
5|$|Keseberg {{brought a}} {{defamation}} suit against {{several members of}} the relief party who accused him of murdering Tamsen Donner. The court awarded him $1 in damages, but also made him pay court costs. An 1847 story printed in the California Star described Keseberg's actions in ghoulish terms and his near-lynching by the salvage party, reporting that he preferred eating human flesh over the cattle and horses that had become exposed in the spring thaw. Historian Charles McGlashan amassed enough material to indict Keseberg for the murder of Tamsen Donner, but after interviewing Keseberg he concluded that no murder occurred. Eliza Donner Houghton also believed Keseberg <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>innocent.</b>|$|E

5|$|Thomas filmed a twelve-minute teaser for his {{new concept}} and {{presented}} it to The CW. The teaser was later released on the Veronica Mars third season DVD and the internet. The clip begins in medias res with Veronica, {{pretending to be a}} high schooler, talking to a teacher. The teaser flashes back to her first FBI meeting, and the viewers discover that she is investigating the teacher for sexual abuse allegations. She successfully catches the teacher on camera, and at the FBI, she runs into a former acquaintance named Seth. She investigates a potential bomber with another novice agent, and they speak to a man who appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>innocent.</b> However, he points a gun at Veronica's partner as the clip ends.|$|E

25|$|Opinion polls at {{the time}} of Corby's arrest in 2004 found that most Australians {{believed}} her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>innocent.</b> Subsequently, an ACNielsen poll published in June 2005, a week after the verdict, found that opinion was divided whether Corby was guilty but there was a perception that the trial had not been carried out fairly. A Morgan poll at the same time found that 51 per cent of Australians believed she was not guilty. However, an August 2010 Nielsen poll found that 1 in 10 respondents believed Corby <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>innocent,</b> 41 per cent thought she was guilty, and 48 per cent did not know. Forty per cent of Australians believed Corby should have had her 20-year prison sentence reduced.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, the Tsarist {{government}} officially {{recognized the}} Karaim as being of Turkic, not Jewish, origin. Because the Karaim were judged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>innocent</b> {{of the death}} of Jesus, they were exempt from many of the harsh restrictions placed on other Jews. They were, in essence, placed on equal legal footing with Crimean Tatars. The related Krymchak community, which was of similar ethnolinguistic background but which practiced rabbinical Judaism, continued to suffer under Tsarist anti-Jewish laws.|$|E

25|$|After Jesus' {{return from}} Herod's court, Pilate {{publicly}} declares that he finds Jesus <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>innocent</b> of the charges, {{but the crowd}} insists on capital punishment. The universal rule of the Roman Empire limited capital punishment strictly to the tribunal of the Roman governor and Pilate decided to publicly wash his hands as not being privy to Jesus' death. Pilate thus presents himself as an advocate pleading Jesus' case {{rather than as a}} judge in an official hearing, yet he orders the crucifixion of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|Five {{years after}} the trial, former Lord Advocate, Lord Fraser, who issued the arrest {{warrants}} in 1991, was alleged to have {{said that he was}} not entirely happy with the evidence presented against Megrahi during his trial in 2000, and in his subsequent appeal in 2002. However, {{he made it clear that}} this did not mean that he believed Megrahi <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>innocent.</b> According to The Sunday Times of 23 October 2005, Lord Fraser allegedly cast doubt upon the reliability of the main prosecution witness, Tony Gauci.|$|E

In November 2008, Hobbs sued Maines and the Dixie Chicks for defamation {{as a result of her}} statements.

Stotesbury, {{to come to the}} defense of Grace Fortescue, Edward J. Lord, Deacon Jones, and Thomas Massie, Fortescue's son-in-law, who were accused of murdering Joseph Kahahawai. Kahahawai had been accused, along with four other men, of raping and beating Thalia Massie, Thomas's wife and Fortescue's daughter; the {{resulting}} 1931 case ended in a hung jury (though the charges were later dropped and repeated investigation has shown them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>innocent).</b> Enraged, Fortescue and Massie then orchestrated the murder of Kahahawai in order to extract a confession and were caught by police officers while transporting his dead body.|$|E
25|$|Miller's {{experience}} with the HUAC affected him throughout his life. In the late 1970s he became {{very interested in the}} highly publicized Barbara Gibbons murder case, in which Gibbons' son Peter Reilly was convicted of his mother's murder based on what many felt was a coerced confession and little other evidence. City Confidential, an A Network series, produced an episode about the murder, postulating that part of the reason Miller took such an active interest (including supporting Reilly's defense and using his own celebrity to bring attention to Reilly's plight) was because he had felt similarly persecuted in his run-ins with the HUAC. He sympathized with Reilly, whom he firmly believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>innocent</b> and to have been railroaded by the Connecticut State Police and the Attorney General who had initially prosecuted the case.|$|E

500|$|Hodgson is Britain's longest serving inmate known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>innocent.</b> He may be {{eligible}} for up to £1million in compensation, although this could increase if a plan to sue the FSS goes ahead.

The piece, titled My Mummy Was Beautiful, was {{dedicated}} to Lennon's mother, Julia, who had died when he was a teenager.
