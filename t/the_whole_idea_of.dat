25|$|Episode 32 of MythBusters {{investigates the}} urban legend of an {{affordable}} jet pack or rocket pack {{that can be}} built from plans purchased on the Internet. Extensive modifications {{were made by the}} MythBusters team due to vagueness in the plans and because of the infeasibility of the specified engine mounting system. The jet pack produced by the MythBusters had two ducted fans powered by ultralight-type piston engines. (Fans complained that the use of piston engines destroyed <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the pack's being truly based on jets, by which, presumably, they meant self-contained gas turbines.) They found it was not powerful enough to lift a person off the ground, and was expensive to build. The plans specified a Rotax 503 ultralight engine, but they intended to use the more powerful and lighter Rotax 583 engine before a similar lighter unnamed engine was substituted.|$|E

Additionally, Winchester was the {{beneficiary}} of 25% of a substantial estate of her maternal great uncle, Levi Merrick Stewart (born December 10, 1827 in Corinna, Maine; died May 3, 1910 in Minneapolis, Minnesota). Following these inheritances, in 1922 Winchester provided the funds to build a home for Wiley at Northwest Nazarene College. According to Ingersol, Throughout her tenure at Northwest Nazarene, Winchester taught her specialties: Biblical language and literature. But she also grew interested in <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> religious education in the local church, and at Northwest Nazarene she developed and taught the initial courses in religious education. She spurred further interest in that emerging discipline by contributing frequent articles on religious education to church papers and curriculum resource manuals.|$|E

However, some historians reject <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>of</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southern expedition by Calicut. According to them, some land and Hindu temple rights {{were transferred to}} Calicut during an official visit to Quilon by the ruler of the Calicut. The nominal reason for the military expedition was {{to protect the rights}} of the Brahmins in Quilon. Quilon had earlier opposed the expansion Calicut supremacy south of Cochin (former Perumpadappu kingdom). However, the Calicut forces advanced by Chetwai and Kanhur River, the Zamorin crossed the backwater at Vypin, marching through Chiranganad Karappuram, Payattukad, Alleppey, Trikunnappuzha and Kartikappally, and entered Odanad. Soon, the ruler of Quilon propitiated Calicut by paying the expenses of the battles, ceding the lands known as Munjiramukkattam (Munjiramukkattam was later transferred by the Calicut to the temple of Padmanabha or to Mathappuram shrine). Quilon also agreed to send annual tribute along with the flag of fealty to Tirunavaya for the Mamankam festival.|$|R

[...] Asked why television news favored Bush's performance over Colbert's, Elizabeth Fishman, an assistant dean at the Columbia School of Journalism and a former 60 Minutes producer, told MTV that the [...] "quick hit" [...] for television news shows would have been to use footage of Bush standing beside his impersonator.

I think that exceeded expectations. There was no right-wing conspiracy or left-wing conspiracy." [...] Time columnist Ana Marie Cox dismissed allegations of a deliberate media blackout, because Colbert's performance received coverage in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the major wire services.

I still feel like I'm falling in love with my wife." [...] Hoppus considered common topics he wrote about to be [...] "miscommunication, loss of identity and questioning of identity which is a process we went through just by being in the studio, writing a new Blink record and having a new iteration of Blink." [...] Though in the past he preferred to ruminate on his lyrics for days on end, Feldmann's speedy process gave Hoppus little time to process them. Despite this, he felt he wrote [...] "some of the best lyrics I've written in a long time for this record, because I didn't have a chance to go and overthink things." [...] Hoppus's self-doubt on his own creative process is referenced in the opening lyrics of [...] "Cynical". [...] "I start every song with this fear, thinking I'm never going to write another good song," [...] he told Upset. Skiba said {{that at the time of}} writing the album, he and Hoppus were both reading books such as , Blood Meridian, and The Revenant, and he felt the prose impacted their lyrics: [...] "there were a lot of rushing rivers and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> using metaphors to describe loneliness, just like settler, Native American and Southern Gothic influence of literature, that was kind of our rhyming dictionary." ...|$|E

The purpose of the package was mainly to widen the Commonwealth's legislative powers {{for the purposes of}} post-war reconstruction. The widening of powers would sunset after five years. One of the measures in the package was to extend Section116 so that it prohibited the states, not merely the Commonwealth, from making the laws proscribed by the section. The package's 14 measureswhich included diverse matters such as powers to provide family allowances and legislate for [...] "national health"were bound together in a single question. H. V.

The conservative Coalition, then in opposition and led by Robert Menzies, campaigned against the package. Arthur Fadden, leader of the Country Party (the junior member of the Coalition), claimed a [...] "yes" [...] vote would permit the government to implement a [...] "policy of socialisation". The package was rejected: the national [...] "yes" [...] vote was less than 46 per cent, and there was majority support for the package only in South Australia and Western Australia. One reason for the rejection was the bundling of multiple controversial proposals into one question: voters could not vote in favour of the measures they supported and against those they opposed, giving them reason to vote against the entire package.|$|E
40|$|Densification {{is one of}} {{the urban}} visions for {{sustainable}} development - a vision that has {{become a part of the}} solution to the unsustainable sake dilemma. With the dense city land will be saved, energy consumption reduced and social cohesion improved. The dense city is considered to be ecologically, economically and socially sustainable. Applying an urban design concept has thus proven to be problematic. Density has been found to be a complex concept which is far more complicated than measuring how much built surface that needs to be covered. It is also not disputed what different degrees of densification mean and whether densification in itself is sustainable. Yet the policies that interpret sustainability continue to advocate exploitation of high density. On <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the dense city has become powerful rhetoric. A strong argument for building high density cities is, among others, that they will be socially beneficial. This work will thus be focusing on the social elements of densification. It will theoretically examine whether densification really is likely to be socially beneficial. Malmö will be examined against the rethoric of densification.

[...] Homer's fellow tutors are drunks, incompetents and down-and-outs, adult education is therefore presented as an amateur business staffed by the dregs of society." [...] The writers of the book thought <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> storytelling and building on experience that Homer uses, and that many adult education tutors uses in real life, is represented in the episode [...] "simply as an excuse for gossip and prurient curiosity". They also thought that statements like [...] "I can't believe I paid ten thousand dollars for this course. What the heck was the lab fee for?" [...] imply that adult education is [...] "exploitative and poor value for money, and that the students themselves contribute to this by demanding an essentially recreational service."
