5|$|Noether spoke quickly—reflecting {{the speed}} of her thoughts, many said—and demanded great {{concentration}} from her students. Students who disliked her style often felt alienated. Some pupils felt that she relied too much on spontaneous discussions. Her most dedicated students, however, relished the enthusiasm with which she approached mathematics, especially since her lectures often built on earlier work <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> together.|$|E
5|$|With {{characteristic}} caution, {{the brothers}} first flew the 1902 glider as an unmanned kite, as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> {{with their two}} previous versions. Rewarding their wind tunnel work, the glider produced the expected lift. It also had a new structural feature: a fixed, rear vertical rudder, which the brothers hoped would eliminate turning problems.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, the {{intersection}} was handling 30,000 drivers a day, from increasingly developed Cornwall, Newburgh and New Windsor. NYSDOT expanded {{the intersection}} with middle-turn lanes and overhead signs on all approaches. Many drivers still felt it was a confusing intersection and that the confusion slowed traffic down as much as the many cars' stopping to enter and exit nearby businesses. In 2001 state officials said <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> everything possible to improve traffic flows through the Five Corners. Continuing congestion was attributable to insufficient or nonexistent planning.|$|E

5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{a sacrament}} {{signifying}} the baptized person's union with Christ, or {{becoming part of}} Christ and being treated as if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> everything Christ had. Sacraments, along with preaching of God's word, are means of grace through which God offers Christ to people. Sacraments {{are believed to have}} their effect through the Holy Spirit, but these effects are only believed to be beneficial to those who have faith in Christ.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into threeparts. In the first 20-minute period, cars finishing 16th or lower were eliminated. The second qualifying period lasted for 15minutes, {{at the end of}} which the fastest ten cars went into the final period, to determine their grid positions for the race. Cars failing to make the final period were allowed to be refuelled before the race but those competing in it were not, and so carried more fuel than <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> in the earlier qualifying sessions.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 IIHF World Championship rosters {{consisted}} of 393 players on 16 national ice hockey teams. Run by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), the Ice Hockey World Championships is the sport's highest-profile annual international tournament. The 2007 IIHF World Championship was the 71st {{edition of the}} tournament and was held in Moscow and Mytischi, Russia. Canada won the Championship, the 24th time <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> so.|$|E

5|$|The fifth fort to fall, Fort Michilimackinac (present Mackinaw City, Michigan), was {{the largest}} fort taken by surprise. On June 2, 1763, local Ojibwas staged a game of stickball (a forerunner of lacrosse) with visiting Sauks. The {{soldiers}} watched the game, as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> on previous occasions. The ball was hit through the open gate of the fort; the teams rushed in and were given weapons which Native women had smuggled into the fort. The warriors killed about 15 of the 35-man garrison in the struggle; later they killed five more in ritual torture.|$|E
5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939 {{and the ensuing}} outbreak of the Second World War, the Netherlands hoped to remain neutral, as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> during the First World War 25 years earlier. To ensure this neutrality, the Dutch army was mobilised from 24 August and entrenched. Large sums (almost 900 million guilders) were spent on defence. It proved very difficult to obtain new matériel in wartime, however, especially as the Dutch had ordered some of their new equipment from Germany, which deliberately delayed deliveries. Moreover, a considerable part of the funds were intended for the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), much of it related to a plan to build three battlecruisers.|$|E

5|$|Although {{she was a}} {{previously}} published novelist and had a successful Broadway play, Rand had difficulty finding a publisher for The Fountainhead. Macmillan Publishing, which had published We the Living, rejected the book after Rand insisted they provide more publicity for her new novel than <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> for the first one. Rand's agent began submitting the book to other publishers; in 1938, Knopf signed a contract to publish the book. When Rand was only a quarter done with the manuscript by October 1940, Knopf canceled her contract. Several other publishers rejected the book. When Rand's agent began to criticize the novel, Rand fired the agent and decided to handle submissions herself. Twelve publishers (including Macmillan and Knopf) rejected the book.|$|E
5|$|As <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> on More, {{the band}} saw {{a rough cut}} of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch. From this, they created a number of pieces that they felt could be {{cross-faded}} at various points in the final cut of the film. They were not worried about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable {{without the need for}} any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create a whole series of well-structured songs. Drummer Nick Mason recalls that the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.|$|E
5|$|Haywood {{observed}} {{how the government}} frequently took the side of business to defeat the tactics and the aspirations of the miners. During an 1899 organizing drive in Coeur d'Alene, with pay cuts as a motivating issue, the company hired spies and then fired organizers and pro-union miners. Some frustrated miners responded with violence and when two men were killed, martial law was declared. As <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> in a strike in Coeur d'Alene seven years earlier, soldiers acted as strike breakers. They rounded up hundreds of union members without formal charges {{and put them in}} a filthy, vermin-infested warehouse without sanitation services for a year. They were so crowded that the soldiers locked the overflow of prisoners in boxcars. One local union leader was imprisoned for 17 years.|$|E

5|$|Hess died on 17 August 1987 {{at the age}} of 93 in {{a summer}} house that had been set up in the prison garden as a reading room. He took an {{extension}} cord from one of the lamps, strung it over a window latch, and hanged himself. Death occurred by asphyxiation. A short note to his family, thanking them for all <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> was found in his pocket. The Four Powers released a statement on 17 September ruling the death a suicide. Initially buried at a secret location to avoid media attention or demonstrations by Nazi sympathisers, Hess was re-interred in a family plot at Wunsiedel on 17 March 1988, and his wife was buried beside him when she died in 1995. Spandau Prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, 1956, the Republican National Committee {{announced}} that Chotiner {{would have no}} role in the upcoming campaign. On June 6, a House subcommittee disclosed that the California attorney had written to President Eisenhower asking the President to intercede on behalf of Stanley Weiss's low-cost charter line North American Airlines (NAA) before the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). The attorney admitted inquiring of White House aides concerning the case, but denied using any influence on behalf of any client. White House officials said that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> no more than ask the CAB when a decision might be expected in NAA's case, and that NAA had lost before the CAB anyway.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2009–10 season, it was {{reported}} that Schroeder intended to leave the University of Minnesota and join the Everett Silvertips, a team in the major junior Western Hockey League. This was denied by Schroeder, who wanted to spend at least another year with the Golden Gophers. The Golden Gophers finished the season with a losing record, the first time <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> so in more than 10years, and lost in the first round of the playoffs, the second time in the past 33 years that had happened. Schroeder finished with 9 goals and 28 points in 37 games, tied for the team lead in points, the lowest for the team's leading scorer since 1962.|$|E

5|$|Protected against double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam {{struck a}} deal with Look {{magazine}} in 1956 to tell their story to journalist William Bradford Huie for between $3,600 and $4,000. The interview took place in the law firm of the attorneys who had defended Bryant and Milam. Huie did not ask the questions; Bryant and Milam's own attorneys did. Neither attorney had heard their clients' accounts of the murder before. According to Huie, the older Milam was more articulate and sure of himself than the younger Bryant. Milam admitted to shooting Till and neither of them believed they were guilty or that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> anything wrong.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei II was {{developed}} by Atlus for the Super Famicom. It was directed by Koji Okada, produced by Hideyuki Yokoyama, and written by Ryutaro Ito, with music composed by Tsukasa Masuko. Kazuma Kaneko designed the game's characters, but was also involved in the planning phase. During the game's pre-production, the development staff visited Hariti's temple in Zōshigaya and Taira no Masakado's grave to cleanse themselves. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> this before, first during {{the development of the}} first Shin Megami Tensei; after one of the staff members got robbed, they decided to do it regularly. The inspiration to do this came from Go Nagai, who was said to have exorcised a spirit with the help of Hariti while writing the manga Devilman.|$|E
5|$|Smashed was {{conceived}} by James Ponsoldt and Susan Burke {{after they had}} a conversation about things <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> while drunk. Some of the story's details were based on Burke's own experience; she was an alcoholic until she was 24 years old, when she started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Burke felt that her experiences with alcoholism had not been represented on film before, and so she decided to write about a young woman deciding to become sober. Burke and Ponsoldt discussed the story, characters and tone in detail before they began to write the script. Since they lived {{on opposite sides of}} the United States, they communicated by email, dividing the script into 15-page installments which they wrote alternately. The entire writing process took six months.|$|E

At the present moment, the world owes them large improvements in dynamics, and in the new uses of steam and iron.
