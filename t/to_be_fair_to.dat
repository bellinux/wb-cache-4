25|$|After the Aloha special, Parker made a {{deal that}} would later be used in court {{to prove that he}} had not acted in the best {{interests}} of Presley. He offered RCA the opportunity to buy Presley's entire back catalog for a mere $5.4 million. At the time, Presley's back catalog was not considered that important and RCA initially calculated it at being worth much less, but in later years it would become one of the most valuable catalogs in the music business. The sale of the catalog to RCA meant that after his death Presley's estate would not receive any royalties for his songs prior to 1973. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> Parker, however, Presley had asked him to raise funds to pay for his upcoming divorce settlement. Presley, who was never one to know the full ins and outs of the music business, would have probably had no idea how important his back catalogue was, and therefore would have trusted Parker's judgment on the matter. Parker, too, could have never known how valuable the catalog would become.|$|E
25|$|In {{selecting}} {{their team}} for Australia the MCC selectors (Sir Pelham Warner, Harry Altham, Gubby Allen, Les Ames, William Findlay, Tom Pearce, Walter Robins, Brian Sellers and Bob Wyatt) {{made the mistake}} on relying on experience {{on one hand and}} youth on the other, but with little between. In this they were not helped by the hole left in English cricket by the Second World War, but only three players (Godfrey Evans, Trevor Bailey and Reg Simpson) were aged between 26 and 31 and could be said to be at their prime; nine of the players were 32 or more and six 26 or less. The captain Freddie Brown had last toured Australia in 1932-33 with Douglas Jardine and Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Denis Compton, Doug Wright, Alec Bedser and Godfrey Evans in 1946-47 under Wally Hammond; {{the rest of the team}} had never travelled down under. Bill Edrich who had made a gutsy 462 runs (46.20) in 1946-47 and would tour Australia again in 1954-55, but was out of favour at Lord's (he was being divorced, and such things counted in the 1950s) and had had an injury-struck season. The two biggest wicket-takers of 1950 were the top spinners Jim Laker and Johnny Wardle. Laker had taken an astounding 8/2 in the 1950 Bradford Test Trial, but his brand of off-spin was deemed too slow for the hard Australian pitches and he was not chosen for the 1954-55 tour either. In the 1956 Ashes series he took 46 wickets (9.60) including 19/90 at Old Trafford and when he finally toured Australia in 1958-59 he took 15 wickets (21.20). The Yorkshireman Johnny Wardle was also left behind, but would finish with 102 Test wickets (20.39) with his combination of Slow Left Arm bowling and Chinamen. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> the selectors Laker had only taken 32 Test wickets (37.34) at the time and Wardle just 2 (56.50). The MCC were committed to a youth policy that consistently failed them. In 1950 they relied overly on young undergraduates from Cambridge University and had lost 3-1 to the West Indies as a result. A continuation of this policy was unlikely to succeed in Australia, but John Dewes, David Sheppard and John Warr were chosen for the tour along with the young professionals Brian Close, Gilbert Parkhouse and Bob Berry. They all failed when faced with real class and only served to increase the burden on the senior players. Remembering his torrid time in 1946-47 Cyril Washbrook declined to tour when selected, but was later flown out with Roy Tattersall and Brian Statham. Washbrook's fears were full realised, Tattersall failed and Statham would not make his Test debut until the party reached New Zealand. Freddie Brown was the selector's third choice to lead the tour, after Norman Yardley of Yorkshire and George Mann of Middlesex both declined the job and he was only chosen as Lord's was determined to have an amateur captain. It was a thankless job as even with the retirement of the great Don Bradman it was clear that Australia were the stronger team and would be hard to beat on their own ground. They had defeated Wally Hammond 3-0 in 1946-47 and Yardley 4-0 in 1948 and England had not won a Test against them in twelve years.|$|E

40|$|Randomization {{is often}} {{recommended}} above self-selection when allocating participants into intervention or control groups. One source of confounding in non-randomized studies is the participants’ attitudes towards the intervention. Because randomized workplace interventions {{are not always}} feasible, it <b>is</b> important <b>to</b> investigate differences between study groups in readiness for change. To meet this aim, we used data from an intervention study {{of the effects of}} work-time control. The study design entailed both self-selection (i. e. non-random) and random allocation into intervention and control groups. Some team leaders rejected randomization because they considered it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fairest</b> <b>to</b> increase work-time control among employees in most need. Others accepted randomization arguing that it <b>was</b> <b>fairer</b> <b>to</b> allocate a potential benefit by random. We found no difference in readiness for changes when comparing the self-selected intervention and control groups. In contrast, the randomized intervention group reported higher readiness for change when compared with both the randomized control group and the self-selected intervention group. This suggests that self-selection into intervention and control groups may reflect the local leaders’ rather than the employees’ readiness for changes and that randomization may influence the participants’ attitude towards the intervention perhaps by evoking an experience of ‘winning or losing in the lottery’...|$|R

2500|$|Even Australia's {{collapse}} {{gave them}} a lead of 52 on a wicket which had dried out and looked a lot better for batting, but the England openers failed again. Peter Richardson was brilliantly caught and bowled by Richie Benaud who had relieved Alan Davidson. Peter May sent in Trevor Bailey—"The Barnacle"—at number three, a very negative move given his reputation as England should have been looking to runs. He was soon joined by Tom Graveney when Milton was caught by Wally Grout off Davidson at 34/2. The stylish Graveney was often criticised for getting out carelessly, but he survived two l.b.w. appeals in an over from Benaud, who beat the bat twice more without success. They took the score to 92/2 {{by the end of}} the day, a lead of 40 runs, with only 122 runs coming in the day. On the fourth day Graveney was halfway down the wicket going for an easy single when Bailey sent him back and he was run out for 36 after staying in for nearly three hours. May was soon out to Benaud (4/66), but Colin Cowdrey (28) stuck in for over two hours before he was caught by Lindsay Kline at grass level. Umpire McInnes was unsighted, but after a nod from Umpire Hays at square-leg umpire gave Cowdrey out, even though he was briefly called back by Harvey, who doubted that the ball had carried. [...] "The Boil" [...] remained glued to the crease for 357 minutes making the slowest 50 by an Englishman in Tests. [...] "Trevor was apt to enjoy playing a character part. 'Barnacle Bailey' as a sobriquet had stuck all too firmly...to the infinite frustration of the crowds—which here at Brisbane showed their feeling by simply staying away" [...] wrote E.W. Swanton, who questioned [...] "whether victory, if it should come, is worth the cost in terms of sterile, boring play that makes one sick at heart to watch". <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> Bailey he had [...] been hailed as a saviour playing in this fashion in 1953 and 1954–55 and was unlikely to change his style at the end of his career. Benaud did not help as he set the field to cut off the stonewaller's limited repertoire of strokes, with Meckiff bowling down the leg side. One pressman roused himself to ask when Bailey had last scored a run, [...] "Twenty minutes past two" [...] answered the England scorer George Duckworth, [...] "Today or yesterday?" [...] was the reply. Just before stumps Bailey suddenly rushed down the pitch to take a swipe at Mackay, missed and was bowled for 68. It was a strangely reckless end as a few more minutes would have allowed Peter May the use of the heavy roller in the morning to break up the wicket for his bowlers. Bailey had batted for 458 minutes and scored from only 40 of the 427 balls he faced. Only 106 runs were made in a full day's play, the lowest in an Ashes Test.|$|E
