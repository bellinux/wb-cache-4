5|$|Amtrak assumed {{control of}} almost all private sector {{intercity}} passenger rail service in the United States on May 1, 1971, with a mandate to reverse decades of decline. It retained approximately 184 of the 440 trains which had run the day before. To operate these trains, Amtrak inherited a fleet of 300 locomotives (electric and diesel) and 1190 passenger cars, most of which dated from the 1940s–1950s. These cars were aging, in need of maintenance, {{and in many cases}} incompatible with each other. The company recognized <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>and</b> opportunity to standardize on a single design.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} anxieties and consternation over government inactivity {{throughout the}} crisis could be deflected and resolved by rescuing {{a handful of}} children.

Penal courts of first instance (or simply penal courts, asliye ceza) are courts with a single judge deciding on minor cases. There is one in every city and in every district, sometimes divided into several branches according to <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>and</b> population.

25|$|In the 1840s {{the major}} {{challenge}} for the Catholic Church was keeping the loyalty of the very poor Catholic arrivals during marches. The fear was that Protestants might use their material needs as a wedge for evangelicalization. In response the Church built a network of charitable institutions such as hospitals, schools, boarding homes, and orphanages, to meet <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>and</b> keep people inside the faith. The Catholic church was less successful in dealing with tensions between its French and the Irish clergy; eventually the Irish took control.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the mid-19th}} century, most fire engines were maneuvered by men, but the {{introduction}} of horse-drawn fire engines considerably improved the response time to incidents. The first self-propelled steam pumper fire engine was built in New York in 1841. Unfortunately for the manufacturers, some firefighters sabotaged the device and its use of the first engine was discontinued. However, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>and</b> the utility of power equipment ensured {{the success of the}} steam pumper well into the twentieth century. Many cities and towns around the world bought the steam fire engines.|$|E
25|$|The countback {{method is}} used in Malta, four Australian jurisdictions (the Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia), and Cambridge, Massachusetts. Casual {{vacancies}} are filled re-examining the ballot papers data from the previous election.

25|$|Passion {{begins with}} a long {{introductory}} foray into the Western philosophical tradition of human nature before moving onto a four-part meditation of human experience and expression. In part one, he sets out to define passion as the noninstrumental dealings that we have with others; they organize and are organized around <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>and</b> danger {{that is at the}} heart of our relations with others. This definition is developed out of the argument that the individual is in constant conflict in the world: at once attempting to assert the self as individual and establish difference, but at same time to gain acceptance by others. We are thus defined by the mutual need and reliance upon each other, and the mutual fear of each other in acceptance or rejection. Passion {{is at the heart of}} this reciprocal and infinite terror and longing for each other.|$|E

His incredible generosity (he would give the shirt off his back if he saw <b>the</b> <b>need,</b> <b>and</b> did so frequently), his deep love for his family and friends, the heart-felt music he composed and played as naturally as he breathed, all speak of a man committed to his desire to live life fully and without restraints. J.P. had a rascally sense of humor, though; another story he loved to tell was of the Romany Gypsy family that lived in the flat above the Pickens in San Francisco in early 1963. The father of the family would {{go out at night}} with a crowbar and smash fenders on cars parked along the street, then come along the next morning to offer to do the bodywork repairs. J.P. thought this was hilarious and told the story often with great relish.|$|E
500|$|In response, Congress debated <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>and</b> {{importance}} of teaching Indians {{regard for the}} rule of law. Further, it was argued that if an Indian committed a crime he could be tried under the laws of the United States. [...] Congress ultimately passed an addendum to the Indian Appropriations Act of March 3, 1885, more commonly known as the Major Crimes Act, claiming exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government to prosecute Indians for seven major crimes anywhere in the nation, if the land is in Indian country, including Indian reservations. [...] The seven original crimes included in the 1885 act (the list is now 15 crimes) were murder, manslaughter, rape, assault with intent to kill, arson, burglary, and larceny.|$|E

Minor operations by individual French ships and small squadrons continued, but the losses of 1805 and 1806, combined with the barring of Spanish ports after the Dos de Mayo Uprising and the seizure of much of the French West Indies in 1809, reduced both <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>and</b> the ability of the French to operate on a large scale in the Atlantic: Lord Barham recognised this when he commented on hearing the news of the victory at San Domingo that it [...] " [...] puts us out off all fear from another predatory war in the West Indies".|$|E
