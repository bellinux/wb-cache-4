5|$|Access to {{the park}} by {{tourists}} improved {{in the early years}} of the park, and conditions in the Valley were made more hospitable. Tourism significantly increased after the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, but the long horseback ride to reach the area was a deterrent. Three stagecoach roads were built in the mid-1870s to provide better access for <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> visitors to Yosemite Valley.|$|E
5|$|As {{the park}} is a {{national}} nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest, all dog owners are required to keep their dogs under control while in the park. This includes not allowing their dog to disturb other park users or disrupt wildlife. In 2009, after some incidents leading {{to the death of}} wildfowl, the park's dogs-on-leads policy was extended. Park users are said to believe that the deer are feeling increasingly threatened by <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> dogs using the park and Royal Parks advises against walking dogs in the park during the deer's birthing season.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Dartmouth College {{president}} William Jewett Tucker decided to explore the possibility of establishing a school of business to educate <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Dartmouth alumni entering the commercial world. Turning to his former roommate from his undergraduate years at Dartmouth, Tucker enlisted the support of Edward Tuck, who had since become a wealthy banker and philanthropist. Tuck donated $300,000 in the form of preferred stock shares in a Minnesota railroad company as the capital to found the school. It was named the Amos Tuck School of Administration and Finance, after Edward Tuck's father and Dartmouth alumnus Amos Tuck.|$|E
5|$|In April 1923, Kongō gave {{transportation}} to Emperor Hirohito during his official {{visit to the}} Japanese possession of Taiwan. In November 1924, Kongo docked at Yokosuka, where modifications were made to her main armament, increasing the elevation of her main guns and improving her fire-control systems. In 1927, Kongō underwent major modifications to her superstructure, rebuilding it into the pagoda mast style to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> fire-control systems for her main guns. In May 1928, her steering equipment was upgraded, before she was placed in reserve in preparation for major modifications and reconstruction in 1929–31.|$|E

5|$|With the 19th century rise of {{nationalism}} and romanticism and <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> translations of the sagas, {{interest in the}} battle of Svolder increased outside of Iceland. Around 1830, the Faroese poet Jens Christian Djurhuus composed a ballad on the battle titled Ormurin langi, following Snorri's account. The ballad was well received and remains among the most popular and well-known Faroese ballads. In 2002, a heavy metal version by the band Týr gained some following abroad.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s onwards, {{homosexuality}} gained {{much wider}} mainstream acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional speculative fiction stories. Works emerged that went beyond simple representation of homosexuality to explorations of specific issues {{relevant to the}} LGBT community. This development was helped by <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> openly gay or lesbian authors and their early acceptance by speculative fiction fandom. Specialist gay publishing presses {{and a number of}} awards recognising LGBT achievements in the genre emerged, and by the twenty-first century blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable by most readers of speculative fiction. There was a concurrent increase in representation of homosexuality within non-literary forms of speculative fiction. The inclusion of LGBT themes in comic books, television and film continues to attract media attention and controversy, while the perceived lack of sufficient representation, along with unrealistic depictions, provokes criticism from LGBT sources.|$|E

5|$|In November 2012 Transport for London (TfL) {{presented}} {{a proposal to}} abolish the Greener Vehicle Discount that benefited, among others, vehicles with small diesel engines that avoid the charge because their engines produce emissions of less than 100g per km of CO2. Approved by Mayor Boris Johnson in April 2013, the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) went into effect on 1 July 2013. The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limit the free access to the congestion charge zone to all-electric cars, some plug-in hybrids, and any car or van that emits 75g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 emission standards for air quality. The measure was designed to curb <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> diesel vehicles on London's roads. About 20,000 owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three-year sunset period before {{they have to pay}} the full congestion charge. The sunset period ended on 24 June 2016.|$|E
5|$|Making {{necessary}} arrangements {{each year}} for <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pilgrims poses a logistic challenge for the government of Saudi Arabia, which has, since the 1950s, spent more than $100 billion to increase pilgrimage facilities. Major issues like housing, transportation, sanitation, and health care have been addressed and improved greatly by the government by introducing various development programs, {{with the result that}} pilgrims now enjoy modern facilities and perform various rites at ease. The Saudi government often sets quota for various countries to keep the pilgrims' number at a manageable level, and arranges huge security forces and CCTV cameras to maintain overall safety during Hajj. Various institutions and government programs, such as the Haj subsidy offered in India or the Tabung Haji based in Malaysia assist pilgrims in covering the costs of the journey. For 2014 Hajj, special Hajj information desks were set up at Pakistani airports to assist the pilgrims.|$|E
5|$|Skagen's {{first school}} was the Latinskole, a grammar school, {{which was in}} {{operation}} from 1549 until 1739. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, three schools had been established in Skagen: one in Vesterby, another in Østerby and a third in Højen. As a result of evolving legislation, a new public primary school (Borgerskolen) designed by A. Haunstrup was completed in 1901. A gymnasium was added in 1909 but in 1924 it was converted into classrooms to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pupils. A secondary school (Realskolen) was opened in 1904 behind the former local authority building on Sct. Laurentii vej. The secondary school was later moved next to the primary school and in 1948 the buildings were extended. An additional two-storey wing was completed in 1969.|$|E

5|$|The mounted police {{assisted}} {{in the construction of}} the Canadian Pacific Railway, including relocating indigenous communities living along the route. The force established a wide network of posts and patrols, enabling them to protect and assist the ranchers who created huge cattle businesses across the prairies. The living conditions of the police on the prairies were spartan and often uncomfortable, and only slowly improved over the course of the century. Meanwhile, the railway enabled more settlers to migrate west, creating new towns and industries, while the force restricted the First Nations to the reservations. The mounted police faced challenges in adapting to the changing situation, especially when applying the unpopular prohibition laws to the white community. The force also became drawn into <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> industrial disputes between organised labour and company owners.|$|E
5|$|The new Italian trend {{combined}} with existing national traditions {{to create a}} particular local Renaissance art. Acceptance of Renaissance art was furthered by the continuous arrival of humanist thought in the country. Many young Hungarians studying at Italian universities came closer to the Florentine humanist center, so a direct connection with Florence evolved. <b>The</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Italian traders moving to Hungary, specially to Buda, helped this process. New thoughts were carried by the humanist prelates, among them Vitéz János, archbishop of Esztergom, {{one of the founders}} of Hungarian humanism. During the long reign of emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg the Royal Castle of Buda became probably the largest Gothic palace of the late Middle Ages. King Matthias Corvinus (r. 1458–1490) rebuilt the palace in early Renaissance style and further expanded it.|$|E
5|$|At E3 2013, Sakurai {{stated that}} the {{tripping}} mechanic introduced in Brawl was removed, with him also stating that the gameplay was between the fast-paced and competitive style of Melee and the slower and more casual style of Brawl. While the games didn't feature cross-platform play between the Wii U and 3DS, due to each version featuring certain exclusive stages and gamemodes, there is an option to transfer customized characters and items between the two versions. The game builds upon the previous game's third-party involvement {{with the addition of}} third-party characters such as Capcom's Mega Man and Bandai Namco's Pac-Man, as well as the return of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog. This involvement expands beyond playable characters, as other third-party characters, such as Ubisoft's Rayman, are also included in the game as trophies. The addition of Mii characters was made in response to <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> requests from fans to have their dream characters included in the game. To prevent potential bullying, as well as to maintain game balance online, Mii Fighters cannot be used in online matches against strangers. The decision to release the Wii U version at a later date from the 3DS version was made to allow each version to receive a dedicated debugging period. Hardware limitations on the Nintendo 3DS led to various design choices, such as the removal of mid-match transformations, the absence of the Ice Climbers, and the lack of Circle Pad Pro support.|$|E

5|$|By 1852, the {{congestion}} at Somerset House {{had increased}} thanks to <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Fellows. Therefore, the Library Committee asked the Council to petition Her Majesty's Government {{to find new}} facilities, with the advice being to bring all the scientific societies, such as the Linnean and Geological societies, under one roof. In August 1866, the government announced their intention to refurbish Burlington House and move the Royal Academy and other societies there. The Academy moved in 1867, while other societies joined when their facilities were built. The Royal Society moved there in 1873, taking up residence in the East Wing. The top floor was used as accommodation for the Assistant Secretary, while the library was scattered over every room and the old caretaker's apartment was converted into offices. One flaw {{was that there was}} not enough space for the office staff, which was then approximately eighty. When, for example, the Society organised the British contribution to the International Geophysical Year in 1954, additional facilities had to be found for the staff outside Burlington House.|$|E
5|$|Critics in the 1990s such as J. R. Harris, Steven Pinker and Jerome Kagan were {{generally}} {{concerned with the}} concept of infant determinism (nature versus nurture), stressing the effects of later experience on personality. Building on the work on temperament of Stella Chess, Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory's cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was far more important than the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan's argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child's temperament. Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in peer groups. H. Rudolph Schaffer concluded that parents and peers had different functions, fulfilling distinctive roles in children's development.|$|E
5|$|Further {{discussion}} on altering the law {{took place in}} 1899, when several prominent cricketers supported an amendment similar to the 1888 proposal: the batsman would be out if the ball would have hit the wicket, where it pitched was irrelevant. At a Special General Meeting of the MCC in 1902, Alfred Lyttelton formally proposed this amendment; the motion was supported by 259 votes to 188, but failed to secure the two-thirds majority required to change the laws. A. G. Steel was the principal opponent of the change, as he believed {{it would make the}} task of the umpires too difficult, but he later regretted his stance. Lyttelton's brother, Robert, supported the alteration and campaigned {{for the rest of his}} life to have the lbw law altered. As evidence that pad-play was increasing and needed to be curtailed, he cited <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> wickets which were falling lbw: the proportion rose from 2% of dismissals in 1870 to 6% in 1890, and 12% in 1923. In 1902, the proposed new law was tried in the Minor Counties Championship, but deemed a failure. An increase in the size of the stumps was one of several other rejected proposals at this time to reduce the dominance of batsmen over bowlers.|$|E
