40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factor}} (FGF) receptors (FGFRs) are membrane-spanning {{tyrosine}} kinase receptors that mediate regulatory signals for cell proliferation and differentiation {{in response to}} FGFs. We have previously determined that the Lys 650 [...] >Glu mutation in the activation loop of the kinase domain of FGFR 3, {{which is responsible for}} the lethal skeletal <b>dysplasia</b> <b>thanatophoric</b> dyplasia type II (TDII), greatly enhances the ligand-independent kinase activity of the receptor. Here, we demonstrate that expression of this construct induces a c-fos promoter construct approximately 10 -fold but does not lead to proliferation or morphological transformation of NIH 3 T 3 cells. In contrast, the isolated kinase domain of activated FGFR 3, targeted to the plasma membrane by a myristylation signal, is able to stimulate c-fos expression by 40 -fold, induce proliferation of quiescent cells, and morphologically transform fibroblasts. This result suggests that the extracellular and transmembrane domains of FGFRs exert a negative regulatory influence on the activity of the kinase domain. Targeting of the activated kinase domain to either the cytoplasm or the nucleus does not significantly affect biological signaling, suggesting that signals from FGFR 3 resulting in mitogenesis originate exclusively from the plasma membrane. Furthermore, our novel observation that expression of a highly activated FGFR 3 kinase domain is able to morphologically transform fibroblasts suggests that dysregulation of FGFR 3 has the potential {{to play a role in}} human neoplasia...|$|R

50|$|Advanced {{paternal}} age may {{be associated}} with a higher risk for certain single-gene disorders caused by mutations of the FGFR2, FGFR3, and RET genes. These conditions are Apert syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome, achondroplasia, <b>thanatophoric</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b. The most significant effect concerns achondroplasia (a form of dwarfism), which might occur in about 1 in 1,875 children fathered by men over 50, compared to 1 in 15,000 in the general population. However, the risk for achondroplasia is still considered clinically negligible. The FGFR genes may be particularly prone to a paternal age effect due to selfish spermatogonial selection, whereby the influence of spermatogonial mutations in older men is enhanced because cells with certain mutations have a selective advantage over other cells (see § DNA mutations).|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{presence}} of a thin-walled, multicystic structure posterior to the fetal head and neck with an intact vertebral column {{is known as a}} cystic hygroma. <b>Thanatophoric</b> <b>dysplasia</b> is the most lethal skeletal dysplasia. <b>Thanatophoric</b> <b>dysplasia</b> (TD) is an autosomal dominant disorder with two phenotypes. TD type I is characterized by a normal shaped skull with bowed femurs and micromelia, while TD type II is characterized by straight femurs with a clover-leaf deformity of the skull and micromelia. We report here a case of <b>thanatophoric</b> <b>dysplasia</b> type I associated with cystic hygroma, this association needs further evaluation. Case history: A 30 year old woman was referred at 26 weeks of gestation because of marked polyhydramnios. Ultrasonographic examination of the fetus revealed a narrow chest, protuberant abdomen, short curved femur, normal shaped skull with accidentally cystic hygroma were present. No other anomalies were detected. We explained to the patient the nature and severity of the anomaly and the patient preferred the termination of pregnancy. Induction of abortion was done successfully. Conclusion: This case report has highlighted the association between cystic hygroma and <b>thanatophoric</b> <b>dysplasia</b> type I. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature reporting the association of cystic hygroma and <b>thanatophoric</b> <b>dysplasia</b> type I.

Fetuses with a confirmed diagnosis of <b>thanatophoric</b> <b>dysplasia</b> were ascertained, records reviewed, sonographic features and measurements determined. Charts of fetal size were then constructed using the LMS (lambda-mu-sigma) method and compared with charts used in normal pregnancies and those complicated by achondroplasia.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} the paper {{was to assess the}} morphometric {{parameters}} to improve the specificity of the ultrasound (US) signs for the early differential diagnosis between two lethal dysplasias, as <b>thanatophoric</b> <b>dysplasia</b> (TD) and osteogenesis imperfecta type 2 (OI- 2). METHOD: The diaphyseal length and the bowed shape of long bones associated with vertebral body dimension assessment were investigated in a group of 14 pregnancy terminations carried out in the time period 2007 - 2013. The definitive diagnosis was established after pregnancy termination by means of skeletal standardized X-rays, histopathology and gene analysis. RESULTS: TD and OI- 2 long bones were significantly shorter than controls. No significant differences were observed between the two dysplasias. The bowing angle was higher in OI- 2; a true angulation or eventually axial displacement was present only in the latter. Furthermore, they did not show any evidence of vertebral collapse. The <b>thanatophoric</b> <b>dysplasia</b> presented less bowed long bones, and never true angulation. The spine was steadily characterized by flattened anterior vertebral bodies. CONCLUSION: Long bone shortening is not a sufficient and accurate sign for early sonographic differential diagnosis between TD and OI- 2. Angled diaphysis, axial diaphyseal displacement and a conserved vertebral body height in the prenatal period support the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta type 2, while moderately regular bowed diaphysis associated with platyspondyly that of <b>thanatophoric</b> <b>dysplasia...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Thanatophoric</b> <b>dysplasia</b> is {{a lethal}} {{chondrodysplasia}} caused by heterozygous fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR 3) missense mutations. Mutations {{have been identified}} in several domains of the receptor. The most frequent mutations (p. R 248 C, p. S 249 C, p. Y 373 C) create a cysteine residue within the extracellular domain, whereas the others eliminate the termination codon (p. X 807 R, p. X 807 C, p. X 807 G, p. X 807 S, p. X 807 W). Here, we report a unique patient with <b>thanatophoric</b> <b>dysplasia</b> and a double de novo FGFR 3 mutation, located on the same allele, (c. [1620 C>A; 1454 A>G]), which corresponds to p. [N 540 K;Q 485 R]. The p. N 540 K mutation is associated with 60 % of patients with hypochondroplasia and the p. Q 485 R mutation is a novel mutation located in a highly conserved domain of FGFRs. Evidence for the structural impact of the two concurrent missense mutations was achieved using protein alignments and three-dimensional structural prediction, in agreement with our modeling of the FGFR 3 structure.

In these disorders, spinal canal and foramen magnum stenosis can cause serious neurologic complications. Here, we provide evidence that FGFR 3 and MAPK signaling in chondrocytes promote synchondrosis closure and fusion of ossification centers. We observed premature synchondrosis closure in the spine and cranial base in human cases of homozygous achondroplasia and <b>thanatophoric</b> <b>dysplasia</b> {{as well as in}} mouse models of achondroplasia. In both species, premature synchondrosis closure was associated with increased bone formation. Chondrocyte-specific activation of Fgfr 3 in mice induced premature synchondrosis closure and enhanced osteoblast differentiation around synchondroses. FGF signaling in chondrocytes increases Bmp ligand mRNA expression and decreases Bmp antagonist mRNA expression in a MAPK-dependent manner, suggesting a role for Bmp signaling in the increased bone formation. The enhanced bone formation would accelerate the fusion of ossification centers and limit the endochondral bone growth. Spinal canal and foramen magnum stenosis in heterozygous achondroplasia patients, therefore, may occur through premature synchondrosis closure. If this is the case, then any growth-promoting treatment for these complications of achondroplasia must precede the timing of the synchondrosis closure...|$|E
