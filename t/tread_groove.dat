40|$|Background: Prevention of {{slipping}} accidents requires {{provision of}} adequate friction {{through the use}} of suitable combinations of footwear and underfoot surfaces. Shoe sole <b>tread</b> <b>groove</b> is one of the important factors on friction coefficient during walking. Objective: To measure the effect of different shoe sole <b>tread</b> <b>groove</b> depths and different surfaces on the required quotient of friction (Q), heel strike velocity and occurrence time of ground reaction forces (GRF) in stance phase during walking on slippery and dry surfaces. Methods: In this semi-experimental study, 22 healthy men were studied under different conditions. The studied independent variables were shoe groove depths (included 1, 2. 5 and 5 mm) and type of walking surface (dry and slippery). Biomechanical gait analysis was carried out with 396 single steps. Data were collected by motion analysis system and two force platform. Results: The occurrence time of GRF was significantly faster on dry surface than slippery surface (p< 0. 01). Q was significantly lower on slippery surface and with groove depths of 1 and 2. 5 mm. The highest value of Q was observed with the deepest groove depth of 5 mm. Heel strike velocity did not differ significantly in the 6 conditions tested. Conclusion: <b>Tread</b> <b>groove</b> depth is a significant factor affecting the Q at the shoes-surface interface on dry and slippery floors. It seems that deeper groove is more appropriate for maintaining the stability during walking. The walking surface affects the occurrence time of GRF; the force components occur sooner on the dry than slippery surface. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} of utilizing geometric interaction between runway asperities and tire pattern design is discussed, and a theoretical basis is presented for substantial enhancement of frictional effects by this process. Test data confirming this is given. First order analytical expressions are {{given for the}} increased friction coefficients and for the engagement distances required. High speed friction data on a 7. 00 x 8 aircraft tire is presented confirming this. Example design geometries are shown for the tire <b>tread</b> <b>groove</b> pattern, and designs and materials are discussed for the asperity grid and its attachment system...|$|E
40|$|A gait {{experiment}} was conducted under two shoe sole and three floor conditions. The shoe soles and floors {{were characterized by}} the <b>tread</b> and <b>groove</b> designs on the surface. The coefficients of friction (COF) {{on the floor in}} the target area were measured. The subjects were required to walk on a walkway and stepping on a target area covered with glycerol. The motions of the feet of the subjects were captured. Gait parameters were calculated based on the motion data. Among the 240 trials, there were 37 no-slips, 81 microslips, 45 slides, and 77 slips. It was found that the condition with shoe sole and floor had both <b>tread</b> <b>grooves</b> perpendicular to the walking direction had the highest COF, the shortest slip distance, and the lowest percentages of slide and slip. The condition with shoe sole and floor had both <b>tread</b> <b>grooves</b> parallel to the walking direction had the lowest COF and the longest slip distance among all experimental conditions. The Pearson’s correlation coefficients between slip distance and slip velocity, time to foot flat, foot angle, and compensatory step length were 0. 8...|$|R

5000|$|Wear bars (or wear indicators) {{are raised}} {{features}} {{located at the}} bottom of the <b>tread</b> <b>grooves</b> that indicate the tire has reached its wear limit. When the tread lugs are worn to the point that the wear bars connect across the lugs, the tires are fully worn and should be taken out of service. Most wear bars indicate a remaining tread depth of 1.6 mm and are tires are deemed [...] "worn out" [...] when the tread is worn down to that point.|$|R
50|$|Sticky {{materials}} such as mud may adhere to the smooth outer tire surface, while smooth loose objects such as stones can become temporarily embedded in the <b>tread</b> <b>grooves</b> as the tire rolls over the ground. These materials can be ejected {{from the surface of}} the tire at high velocity as the tire imparts kinetic energy to the attached objects. For a vehicle moving forward, the top of the tire is rotating upward and forward, and can throw objects into the air at other vehicles or pedestrians in front of the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Other changes {{required}} cars not {{be allowed}} to race on, previously used, slicks (smooth tires), requiring profiled (<b>treaded</b> or <b>grooved)</b> tires. Also, the driver was required to sit more upright with a seating angle of, at most, 27 degrees.|$|R
50|$|All {{prefecture}}s of Japan, {{except for}} the southernmost prefecture of Okinawa, require the motorized vehicles to be fitted with winter tires or tire chains if the road is icy or slushy. If <b>tread</b> <b>grooves</b> of snow tires are worn off for more than 50% of its original depth, tires must be replaced to meet the legal requirements. Drivers will be fined for failing {{to comply with the}} snow tire or tire chains requirements. Nationwide studded tire restrictions for passenger vehicles came in effect in April 1991, followed by restrictions for commercial trucks in 1993. Studded tires are technically still legal in Japan, but the usage is restricted by environmental law and it is a criminal offence to operate a vehicle fitted with studded tire on dry asphalt or concrete.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{completely}} slick tyres are outlawed on most roads due {{to their}} inability to handle wet pavement, the [...] "cheater slick" [...] became a popular item in the hot rod world in the 1960s; a typical slick type tyre, but engraved with the absolute minimal amount of <b>tread</b> <b>grooves</b> required to satisfy legal requirements. Since then, however, tyre development has progressed greatly, so that today's hot rod street cars typically use wide, grooved tyres which perform better than the slicks of the past; while the cheater slicks available today, both for nostalgic appearance of street cars and for competition use in classes where DOT approved street tyres are required, have followed their own line of development, diverging from true slick tyre construction to become a distinct tyre design in themselves.|$|R
5000|$|The {{steering}} is power-assisted and the tubeless tiresfeature {{a special}} high-pressure inner tire tube, {{which provides a}} built-in backup in case air pressure is lost from the main tire itself, {{as well as providing}} lateral support to eliminate leakage from the tire beadduring high speed cornering. The tires are self-cleaning, meaning mud and other materials are flung free from the <b>tread</b> <b>grooves</b> by centrifugalforce, rather than sticking to the tire (more commonly known as a [...] "mud tire"). Disc brakes are fitted on all four wheels. The electrical system is 24V DC,and two batteries with a capacity of 45 Amp/Hr are provided. The alternator is of the integral rectifier and regulator type. The XR311 isprovided with a heavy duty towing pintle as well as a trailer wiring harness receptacle. It is air-transportable and can be air-dropped.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects that different basketball shoe outsole tread patterns have on the amount of slip and therefore the performance of the individual while undergoing normal basketball transitions. <b>Tread</b> <b>grooves</b> and therefore patterns must exist on the outsole of a basketball shoe because the chances of contamination and for practical durability. With the existence of so many basketball shoes with varying tread patterns and characteristics it presents the question of whether or not varying patterns affect traction, slip, and therefore athletic performance. This study evaluated the amount of slips of two pairs of basketball shoes with human participants running basketball drills on a hardwood basketball floor at Wartburg College. The results indicated that one shoe with a much more unique tread pattern performed better with fewer slips, and fewer severe slips, especially when considering lateral movements than the other shoe which had a tread pattern with similar tread characteristics to many other currently available market shoes...|$|R
50|$|The main {{changes to}} the Nuna 5 from its {{predecessor}} the Nuna 4 was the diminished battery weight, changing from 30 kg in 2007 to 25 kg.Other changes required cars {{not be allowed to}} race on previously used slicks (smooth tires), instead requiring profiled (<b>treaded</b> or <b>grooved)</b> tires. Also, the driver was required to sit more upright with a seating angle of, at most, 27 degrees. It finished second.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of various factors affecting {{the severity of}} runway debris lofting mechanisms was investigated by performing numerical simulations and drop weight impact experiments to assess {{the likelihood of a}} stone impact. Geometrical characterisation of stones collected from airfields led to a generic model of a tyre rolling over stones of various shape with different overlaps, orientations, and densities. In numerical simulations of a 0. 4 m diameter aircraft tyre rolling at 70 m/s, a 10 mm diameter spherical stone was lofted at a maximum vertical speed of 35 m/s. For equivalent mass prolate spheroid stones, the loft speeds were 11 to 34 % lower depending on the stone orientation. Objects with flat surfaces exhibited different lofting mechanisms and lower angular velocities. The conditions most conducive to stone lofting were very stiff, small diameter, sharp cornered tyres rolling on ground with a high friction coefficient over spherical stones such that just under half the stone diameter was covered by the tyre. The stone loft speed was approximately proportional to the square root of the tyre tread stiffness. Finally, tyre <b>tread</b> <b>grooves</b> could throw stones upwards at the tyre-ground separation speed, which was 17 m/s for the conditions mentioned earlier...|$|R
50|$|Tire <b>tread</b> block shapes, <b>groove</b> configurations, and sipes affect {{tire noise}} pattern and {{traction}} characteristics. Typically, wide, straight grooves {{have a low}} noise level and good water removal. More lateral grooves usually increase traction. Sipes are small grooves that are cut across larger tread elements. Up to a point, more sipes give more traction in snow or mud.|$|R
50|$|The word tread {{is often}} used casually {{to refer to the}} pattern of grooves molded into the rubber, but those grooves are {{correctly}} called the tread pattern, or simply the pattern. The grooves are not the tread, they are in the tread. This distinction is especially significant in the case of racing slicks, which have a lot of <b>tread</b> but no <b>grooves.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Supermoto uses motocross bikes {{converted}} for racing on tracks consisting three sections, flat dirt, dirt obstacles, and paved road. The bikes {{have special}} road-racing tires with <b>grooved</b> <b>tread</b> to grip both {{the pavement and}} dirt. Some tracks for these race events have jumps, berms, and whoops like motocross tracks. For special events, the Supermoto track may incorporate metal ramps for jumps that can be disassembled and taken to other locations. [...] Supermoto races may take place at modified go-kart tracks, road racing tracks, or even street racing tracks. There are also classes for kids such as the 85cc class.|$|R
25|$|Results {{have been}} mixed as the lack of {{mechanical}} grip {{has resulted in the}} more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip– pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn has resulted in less overtaking as these devices tend to make the wake behind the car 'dirty' (turbulent), preventing other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track. The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the <b>grooved</b> <b>tread</b> blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to study the effect of grooved runway configurations on aircraft tire braking traction on flooded runway surfaces. The investigation was performed, utilizing size 49 x 17, type VII, aircraft tires with an inflation pressure of 170 lb per square inch at ground speeds up to approximately 120 knots. The results of this investigation indicate that when the runway is flooded, grooved surfaces provide better braking traction than an ungrooved surface and, in general, the level of braking traction was found to improve as the tire bearing pressure was increased because {{of an increase in}} the groove area of either the surface or the tire <b>tread.</b> Rounding the <b>groove</b> edges tended to degrade the tire braking capability from that developed on the same groove configuration with sharp edges. Results also indicate that braking friction coefficients for the test tires and runway surfaces decreased as ground speed was increased because of the hydroplaning effects...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the deaths}} of Senna and Ratzenberger, the FIA has used safety {{as a reason to}} impose rule changes that otherwise, under the Concorde Agreement, would have had to be agreed upon by all the teams — most notably the changes {{introduced}} for 1998. This so-called 'narrow track' era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip. There were to be four grooves on the front (three in the first year) and rear that ran through the entire circumference of the tyre. The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and to produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tyre and track. This, according to the FIA, was to promote driver skill and provide a better spectacle.Results have been mixed as the lack of mechanical grip has resulted in the more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip — pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn has resulted in less overtaking as these devices tend to make the wake behind the car 'dirty' (turbulent), preventing other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track.
