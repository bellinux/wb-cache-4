5|$|It is {{not certain}} that the slaves were a {{homogeneous}} group {{under the leadership of}} Spartacus.

Certainly other slave leaders are mentioned—Crixus, Oenomaus, Gannicus, and Castus—and it cannot be told from the historical evidence whether they were aides, subordinates, or even equals leading groups of their own and traveling in convoy with Spartacus' people.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the features of}} AMCOMP, a CAD environment conceived to manage the computation of <b>the</b> <b>Added</b> Masses of bodies moving in an infinite fluid. A methodology already published in literature has been implemented in a CAD environment and its features are exploited to perform the evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>Added</b> Masses. These include the importing of the model in STL file format and the computation of <b>the</b> complete <b>Added</b> Mass matrix and non-dimensional terms. The CAD has been validated by computing <b>the</b> <b>Added</b> Masses values of bodies whose exact formulation was found in literature. The validated tool {{has been applied to}} more complex case studies where <b>the</b> <b>Added</b> Masses values were guessed using empirical laws or the equivalent ellipsoid approximation. Significant differences have been found between approximated methods and computations on real shapes. It is shown that the precision in <b>the</b> <b>Added</b> Masses computation and the computational time depend on the meshing quality of the model and power of the PC on which the software runs. Several tools have been merged to obtain a model useful for <b>the</b> <b>Added</b> Masses computation and to assess the errors arising from using approximated formulas instead of the real shape of the body...|$|R

5|$|Stephen Báthory's reign {{marks the}} end of szlachta's reform movement. The foreign king was skeptical of the Polish {{parliamentary}} system and had little appreciation for what the execution movement activists had been trying to accomplish. Batory's relations with Sienicki soon deteriorated, while other szlachta leaders had advanced within the nobility ranks, becoming senators or being otherwise preoccupied with their own careers. The reformers managed to move in 1578 in Poland and in 1581 in Lithuania the out-of-date appellate court system from the monarch's domain to the Crown and Lithuanian Tribunals run by the nobility. The cumbersome sejm and sejmiks system, <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> hoc confederations, and the lack of efficient mechanisms for the implementation of the laws escaped the reformers' attention or will to persevere. Many thought that the glorified nobility rule had approached perfection.|$|E
