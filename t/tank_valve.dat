40|$|In {{the study}} {{presented}} in this paper a single-cylinder Scania D 12 diesel engine has been converted to work as a pneumatic hybrid. During pneumatic hybrid operation the engine {{can be used as a}} 2 -stroke compressor for generation of compressed air during vehicle deceleration and during vehicle acceleration the engine can be operated as an air-motor driven by the previously stored pressurized air. The compressed air is stored in a pressure tank connected to one of the inlet ports. One of the engine inlet valves has been modified to work as a <b>tank</b> <b>valve</b> in order to control the pressurized air flow to and from the pressure tank. In order to switch between different modes of engine operation there is a need for a VVT system and the engine used in this study is equipped with pneumatic valve actuators that uses compressed air in order to drive the valves and the motion of the valves are controlled by a combination of electronics and hydraulics. This paper describes the introduction of new <b>tank</b> <b>valve</b> geometry to the system with the intent to increase the pneumatic hybrid regenerative efficiency. The new <b>tank</b> <b>valve</b> has a larger valve head diameter than the previously used setup described in [1], in order to decrease the pressure drop over the <b>tank</b> <b>valve.</b> In order to ensure <b>tank</b> <b>valve</b> operation during high in-cylinder pressures the valve is combined with an in-house developed pneumatic valve spring which makes the <b>tank</b> <b>valve</b> pressure compensated.

However, this mode of operation led to an increase in feed pressure. Hence, later on, the experiment was repeated with a new set of membranes where the feed pressure was maintained constant by controlling the brine valve (V# 3) as shown in Fig.  2. Towards the end of the trial, a higher concentration of salt (up to 24  %) was used with daily dosing for a period of 2  min. This experiment was also repeated with a new set of membranes as there was a sudden unexpected increase in permeate conductivity during the second trial.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Volatiles {{are easily}} {{accessible}} and {{widely used in}} a form of liquid petroleum gas. Death {{as a consequence of}} inhalation of volatiles can be either accidental or suicidal. Case Outline We present a 62 -year-old men who committed suicide by placing a plastic bag over the head and inhaling propane-butane mixture from a domestic gas tank. A rubber hose was attached to the <b>tank</b> <b>valve</b> and connected with the plastic bag. The body of the deceased showed signs of advanced postmortal changes. A suicidal note was found at the scene. Conclusion Propane-butane mixture, i. e. liquified petroleum gas leads to the depletion of oxygen in the air consequently causing hypoxia and anoxia, and therefore, unconsciousness and eventual death. The mechanisms of death in cases of volatile inhalation include cardiac arrhythmias, reflex cardiac vagal inhibition, and/or central nervous system depression. Similar mechanisms occur in cases of asphyxiation with a plastic bag. The reconstruction of the event in this case was based, not so much on autopsy findings (because of significant putrefaction changes), but on the police investigation and traces found at the scene. ...|$|E

40|$|Architectures for {{extended}} duration missions often include an on-orbit replenishment {{of the space}} vehicle's cryogenic liquid propellants. Such a replenishment could be accomplished via a tank-to-tank transfer from a dedicated tanker or a more permanent propellant depot storage tank. Minimizing the propellant loss associated with transfer line and receiver propellant tank thermal conditioning is essential for mass savings. A new methodology for conducting tank-to-tank transfer while minimizing such losses has been demonstrated. Charge-Hold-Vent is the traditional methodology for conducting a tank-to-tank propellant transfer. A small amount of cryogenic liquid is introduced to chill the transfer line and propellant tank. As the propellant absorbs heat and undergoes a phase change, the tank internal pressure increases. The tank is then vented to relieve pressure prior to another charge of cryogenic liquid being introduced. This cycle is repeated until the transfer lines and tank are sufficiently chilled and the replenishment of the propellant tank is complete. This method suffers inefficiencies due to multiple chill and vent cycles within the transfer lines and associated feed system components. Additionally, this system requires precise measuring of cryogenic fluid delivery for each transfer, multiple valve cycling events, and other complexities associated with cycled operations. To minimize propellant loss and greatly simplify on-orbit operations, an alternate methodology has been designed and demonstrated. The Vented Chill / No Vent Fill method is a simpler, constant flow approach in which the propellant tank and transfer lines are only chilled once. The receiver tank is continuously vented as cryogenic liquid chills the transfer lines, tank mass and ullage space. Once chilled sufficiently, the receiver <b>tank</b> <b>valve</b> is closed and the tank is completely filled. Interestingly, the vent valve can be closed prior to receiver tank components reaching liquid saturation temperature. An incomplete fill results if insufficient energy {{is removed from the}} tank's thermal mass and ullage space. The key to successfully conducting the no vent fill is to assure that sufficient energy is removed from the system prior to closing the receiver tank vent valve. This paper will provide a description of the transfer methodology and test article, and will provide a discussion of test results...|$|E

During deceleration, the energy previously used {{to accelerate the}} vehicle is mainly wasted on heat generated by the friction brakes. If this energy that is wasted in traditional IC engines could be saved, the fuel economy would improve. Today there are several solutions {{to meet the demand}} for better fuel economy {{and one of them is}} the pneumatic hybrids. The idea with pneumatic hybridization is to reduce the fuel consumption by taking advantage of the, otherwise lost, brake energy. In the work presented in this study a heavy duty Scania D 12 engine has been converted to work as a pneumatic hybrid. During pneumatic hybrid operation the engine can be used as a 2 ‐stroke compressor for generation of compressed air during vehicle deceleration (compressor mode) and during vehicle acceleration the engine can be operated as an air‐motor driven by the previously stored pressurized air (air‐motor mode). The compressed air is stored in a pressure tank connected to one of the inlet ports. One of the engine inlet valves has been modified to work as a <b>tank</b> <b>valve</b> in order to control the pressurized air flow to and from the pressure tank. In order to switch between different modes of engine operation there is a need for a fully variable valve actuation (FVVA) system. The engine used in this study is equipped with pneumatic valve actuators that use compressed air in order to drive the valves and the motion of the valves are controlled by a combination of electronics and hydraulics. Since the pneumatic VVA system, used in the work presented in this thesis, was still under development, the need to evaluate the system before any extensive use was more than necessary. The evaluation of the pneumatic VVA system verified its potential and a stable function was noticed together with great flexibility to manipulate both valve timing and valve lift to fit the desired purpose. Initial testing concerning the different pneumatic hybrid engine modes of operation was conducted. Both compressor mode (CM) and air‐motor mode (AM) were executed successfully. Optimization of CM and AM with regards to valve timing and valve geometry has been done with great improvements in regenerative efficiency which is defined as the ratio between the energy extracted during AM and the energy consumed during CM...|$|E
