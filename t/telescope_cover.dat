40|$|The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is {{the latest}} {{addition}} to the suite of missions on or orbiting Mars {{as part of the}} NASA Mars Exploration Program. Launched on 12 August 2005, the orbiter successfully entered Mars orbit on 10 March 2006 and finished aerobraking on 30 August 2006. Now in its near-polar, near-circular, low-altitude (approximately 300 km), 3 p. m. orbit, the spacecraft is operating its payload of six scientific instruments throughout a one-Mars-year Primary Science Phase (PSP) of global mapping, regional survey, and targeted observations. Eight scientific investigations were chosen for MRO, two of which use either the spacecraft accelerometers or tracking of the spacecraft telecom signal to acquire data needed for analysis. Six instruments, including three imaging systems, a visible-near infrared spectrometer, a shallow-probing subsurface radar, and a thermal-infrared profiler, were selected to complement and extend the capabilities of current working spacecraft at Mars. Whether observing the atmosphere, surface, or subsurface, the MRO instruments are designed to achieve significantly higher resolution while maintaining coverage comparable to the current best observations. The requirements to return higher-resolution data, to target routinely from a low-altitude orbit, and to operate a complex suite of instruments were major challenges successfully met in the design and build of the spacecraft, {{as well as by the}} mission design. Calibration activities during the seven-month cruise to Mars and limited payload operations during a three-day checkout prior to the start of aerobraking demonstrated, where possible, that the spacecraft and payload still had the functions critical to the science mission.

40|$|The Kepler Mission is {{designed}} to survey our region of the Milky Way galaxy to discover hundreds of Earth-sized and smaller planets {{in or near the}} habitable zone. The Kepler photometer is an array of 42 CCDs (charge-coupled devices) in the focal plane of a 95 -cm Schmidt camera onboard the Kepler spacecraft. Each 50 x 25 -mm CCD has 2, 200 x 1, 024 pixels. The CCDs accumulate photons and are read out every six seconds to prevent saturation. The data is integrated for 30 minutes, and then the pixel data is transferred to onboard storage. The data is subsequently encoded and transmitted to the ground. During End-to-End Information System (EEIS) testing of the Kepler Mission System (KMS), there was a need to verify that the pixels requested by the science team operationally were correctly collected, encoded, compressed, stored, and transmitted by the FS, and subsequently received, decoded, uncompressed, and displayed by the Ground Segment (GS) without the outputs of any CCD modules being flipped, mirrored, or otherwise corrupted during the extensive FS and GS processing. This would normally be done by projecting an image on the focal plane array (FPA), collecting the data in a flight-like way, and making a comparison between the original data and the data reconstructed by the science data system. Projecting a focused image onto the FPA through the telescope would normally involve using a collimator suspended over the telescope opening. There were several problems with this approach: the collimation equipment is elaborate and expensive; as conceived, it could only illuminate a limited section of the FPA (. 25 percent) during a given test; the <b>telescope</b> <b>cover</b> would have to be deployed during testing to allow the image to be projected into the telescope; the equipment was bulky and difficult to situate in temperature-controlled environments; and given all the above, test setup, execution, and repeatability were significant concerns. Instead of using this complicated approach of projecting an optical image on the FPA, the Kepler project developed a method using known defect features in the CCDs to verify proper collection and reassembly of the pixels, thereby avoiding the costs and risks of the optical projection approach. The CCDs composing the Kepler FPA, as all CCDs, had minor defects. At ambient temperature, some pixels look far brighter than they should. These ghot h pixels have a higher rate of charge leakage than the others due to manufacturing variations. They are usually stable over time, and appear at temperatures above 5 oC. The hot pixels on the Kepler FPA were mapped before photometer assembly during module testing. Selected hot pixels were used as target gstars h for the purposes of EEIS testing. gDead h pixels are permanently off, producing a permanently black pixel. These can also be used if there is some illumination of the FPA. During EEIS testing, Dark Current Full Frame Images (FFIs) taken at room temperature were used to create the hot pixel maps for all 84 Kepler photometer CCD channels. Data from two separate nights were used to create two hot pixel maps per channel, which were cross-correlated to remove cosmic ray events which appear to be hot pixels. These hot pixel maps obtained during EEIS testing were compared to the maps made during module testing to verify that the end-to-end data flow was correct...|$|E

There were four <b>telescope</b> front <b>covers</b> and seven motorized detector covers on the EUVE science payload. The EUVE satellite was launched into orbit in June 1992 and all the covers operated successfully after launch. This success {{can be attributed to}} high design margins and extensive testing at each level of assembly. This paper described the design of the <b>telescope</b> front <b>covers</b> and the motorized detector covers. This paper also discusses some of the many design considerations and modifications made as performance and reliability problems became apparent from each phase of testing...|$|R

To ensure precise positioning of the fibers, a metrology camera {{is designed to provide}} the fiber position information within 5 μm error. The final positioning accuracy of PFS is targeted to be better than 10 μm. The metrology camera will locate at the Cassegrain focus of Subaru <b>telescope</b> to <b>cover</b> the whole focal plane. The PFS metrology camera will also serve for the existing multi-fiber infrared spectrograph FMOS. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures; Ground-based and Airborne Instrumentation for Astronomy IV, Proc.

40|$|New {{generation}} Cherenkov <b>telescopes</b> <b>cover</b> a {{wide range}} of longitudes (137 °E to 110 °W) allowing continuous observations to follow transient sources. Given the close match in longitude of the MAGIC (17. 9 °W) and H. E. S. S. (16 °E) sites, simultaneous observations at greatly differing zenith angles are also feasible. The measurable energy range can thus be extended beyond what is accessible to individual instruments. The planning and coordination of world-wide observations is challenging and requires close interaction between the different collaborations. The potential of Global Network of Cherenkov Telescopes (GNCT) campaigns for blazar physics and studies of the energy dependent absorption of very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays on the extragalactic background light are discussed. Also, first results from a joint H. E. S. S. and MAGIC observation of Mkn 421 in 2004 are presented...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a prototype solar telescope system successfully and performed the first observation of the sun capturing beautiful images of the sun 2 ̆ 7 s surface. The system contains three kinds of solar telescopes with different instrumental feature. The main telescope is refraction telescope with a diameter of 15 cm and with a focal length of 1, 100 mm that enables us to observe detail structures of the solar photosphere with white light. The other two telescopes are H-alpha telescope and CaK telescope {{both of which are}} also refraction telescopes with a focal length of 500 mm. These <b>telescopes</b> <b>cover</b> the whole area of the sun. Utilizing these three telescopes with different wavelength and different area coverage on the sun 2 ̆ 7 s surface, we shall perform a variety of scientific observation in near future...|$|R
50|$|A feeder is {{most often}} used to feed {{granulated}} sugar or sugar syrup at {{times of the year}} when no, or not enough, nectar flow is available from natural sources to meet the hive's needs. There are various styles. Division board feeders have a shape {{similar to that of the}} frame, and hang inside the hive body in the same manner as a frame. Entrance feeders are wedged into the hive entrance on the bottom board with an inverted container of feed. Hive-top feeders have the same footprint as the hive body and are placed on top of the hive, but underneath the <b>telescoping</b> <b>cover.</b> Other hive-top feeders consist of an inverted container with small holes in the lid, which are placed either directly on top of the frames, or on top of the hole in the inner cover.|$|R
