25|$|More {{recently}} DCC {{has been}} characterized as a dependence receptor, and many hypotheses have been put forward that have revived interest in DCCs candidacy as a <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene,</b> {{as it may be}} a ligand-dependent suppressor that is frequently epigenetically silenced.|$|E
25|$|The first direct {{evidence}} for DCC as a <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> {{was published in}} 1995. Researchers found that addition of DCC to an immortalized cell line suppressed tumorigenicity rather definitively. However no mechanism for this suppression was obvious, and it took several years to propose one.|$|E
25|$|Since it {{was first}} {{discovered}} in a colorectal cancer study in 1990, DCC {{has been the focus}} of a significant amount of research. DCC held a controversial place as a <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> for many years, and is well known as an axon guidance receptor that responds to netrin-1.|$|E
40|$|Aims—Loss of {{heterozygosity}} (LOH) {{at specific}} chromosomal regions strongly suggests {{the existence of}} <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> at the relevant segment. Frequent LOH on chromosome 5 q {{has been reported in}} a wide variety of human tumours, including those of the lung. The aim of this study was to screen for LOH and to clarify the location of putative <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> on chromosome 5 implicated in the genesis and/or development of non-small cell lung carcinoma...|$|R
40|$|Background: With the {{advances}} in high throughput technologies, {{increasing amounts of}} cancer somatic mutation data are being generated and made available. Only {{a small number of}} (driver) mutations occur in driver genes and are responsible for carcinogenesis, while the majority of (passenger) mutations do not influence tumour biology. In this study, SomInaClust is introduced, a method that accurately identifies driver genes based on their mutation pattern across tumour samples and then classifies them into oncogenes or <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> respectively. Results: SomInaClust starts from the observation that oncogenes mainly contain mutations that, due to positive selection, cluster at similar positions in a gene across patient samples, whereas <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> contain a high number of protein-truncating mutations throughout the entire gene length. The method was shown to prioritize driver genes in 9 different solid cancers. Furthermore it was found to be complementary to existing similar-purpose methods with the additional advantages that it has a higher sensitivity, also for rare mutations (occurring in less than 1 % of all samples), and it accurately classifies candidate driver genes in putative oncogenes and <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the identified genes belong to known cancer signalling pathways, and that the distinction between oncogenes and <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> is biologically relevant. Conclusions: SomInaClust was shown to detect candidate driver genes based on somatic mutation patterns of inactivation and clustering and to distinguish oncogenes from <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> The method could be used for the identification of new cancer genes or to filter mutation data for further data-integration purposes...|$|R
40|$|Since {{cancer is}} one of the leading causes of death worldwide, there is an urgent need to find better treatments. Currently, the use of {{chemotherapeutics}} remains the predominant option for cancer therapy. However, one of the major obstacles for successful cancer therapy using these chemotherapeutics is that patients often do not respond or eventually develop resistance after initial treatment. Therefore identification of genes involved in chemotherapeutic response is critical for predicting tumour response and treating drug-resistant cancer patients. A group of genes commonly lost or inactivated are <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes,</b> which can promote the initiation and progression of cancer through regulation of various biological processes such as cell proliferation, cell death and cell migration/invasion. Recently, mounting evidence suggests that these <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> also play a very important role in the response of cancers to a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs. In the present review, we will provide a comprehensive overview on how major <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> [Rb (retinoblastoma), p 53 family, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, BRCA 1 (breast-cancer susceptibility gene 1), PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10), Hippo pathway, etc. ] are involved in chemotherapeutic drug response and discuss their applications in predicting the clinical outcome of chemotherapy for cancer patients. We also propose that <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> are critical chemotherapeutic targets for the successful treatment of drug-resistant cancer patients in future applications...|$|R
25|$|Chromosome 18 LOH {{tends to}} occur in clusters. One major cluster is at 18q21, which agrees with the {{location}} of DCC. This cluster includes the marker D18S51, and is flanked by the D18S1109 and D18S68 loci. This segment spans 7.64cM, which is a relatively large section of DNA that could easily encompass more than one <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene.</b>|$|E
25|$|DCC can be {{considered}} a conditional <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> as well as a conditional oncogene. When DCC is present and not activated by netrin it is proapoptotic, and represses tumour formation. When DCC is present and netrin-activated it promotes cell survival, acting as an oncoprotein. Netrin-activated DCC is known to activate the CDC42-RAC1 and MAPK1/3 pathways, both of which are activated in cancer and promote tumour development.|$|E
25|$|DCC in a {{receptor}} for netrin-1 and {{is currently}} believed {{by some to be}} a conditional <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene,</b> meaning that it normally prevents cell growth when in the absence of netrin-1. DCC elimination is not believed to be a key genetic change in tumour formation, but one of many alterations that can promote existing tumour growth. DCC's possible role in migration of cancerous cells {{is in the process of}} being characterized.|$|E
40|$|Genetic aberrations {{frequently}} {{occurring in}} a specific tumour type are thought {{to play an important}} role in the development of these tumours. Losses of specific chromosomal regions may point to regions containing <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes,</b> whereas amplified regions may point to regions containing oncogenes. In renal cell tumours (RCT) loss of the short arm of chromosome 3 is detected frequently, which suggests the presence of (a) <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene(s)</b> involved in the development of these specific tumours.

25|$|Direct {{benefits}} of epigenomic mapping include probable advances in cloning technology. It {{is believed that}} failures to produce cloned animals with normal viability and lifespan result from inappropriate patterns of epigenetic marks. Also, aberrant methylation patterns are well characterized in many cancers. Global hypomethylation results in decreased genomic stability, while local hypermethylation of <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> promoters often accounts for their loss of function. Specific patterns of methylation are indicative of specific cancer types, have prognostic value, and can help to guide {{the best course of}} treatment.|$|E
25|$|Early {{studies of}} {{colorectal}} tumours found that allelic deletions of segments of chromosome 18q {{occur in a}} very high percentage of colorectal cancers. DCC was initially cloned out {{of the region and}} put forth as a putative <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene,</b> though nothing was known about its function at the time. The DCC gene was examined for the genetic changes found with most other tumour suppressor genes, but it was found to have a comparatively low frequency of somatic mutation. Several years later DCC was shown to encode a transmembrane receptor protein that mediated the effects of netrin-1 on axon outgrowth.|$|E
25|$|Several drug therapies {{are being}} {{developed}} based on p53, the <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> that protects the cell in response to damage and stress. It is analogous to deciding {{what to do with}} a damaged car: p53 brings everything to a halt, and then decides whether to fix the cell or, if the cell is beyond repair, to destroy the cell. This protective function of p53 is disabled in most cancer cells, allowing them to multiply without check. Restoration of p53 activity in tumours (where possible) has been shown to inhibit tumour growth and can even shrink the tumour.|$|E
50|$|These {{large scale}} projects, {{involving}} about 350 {{different types of}} tumour, have identified ~130,000 mutations in ~3000 genes that have been mutated in the tumours. The majority occurred in 319 genes, of which 286 were <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> and 33 oncogenes.|$|R
50|$|As well {{as leading}} the Ovarian Cancer Programme at Imperial, his {{laboratory}} {{is involved in}} trying to understand the role of <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> in ovarian cancer, particularly how OPCML regulates networks of receptor tyrosine kinases and how WWOX acts to regulate taxane sensitivity.|$|R
50|$|In 1969, Harris {{showed that}} when {{malignant}} cancer cells were fused with normal fibroblasts, the resulting hybrids were not malignant, thus demonstrating {{the existence of}} genes that {{had the ability to}} suppress malignancy. Work on these <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> has become a worldwide industry.|$|R
25|$|Two {{forms of}} {{retinoblastoma}} were noticed: a bilateral, familial form and a unilateral, sporadic form. Sufferers {{of the former}} were 6 {{times more likely to}} develop other types of cancer later in life. This highlighted the fact that mutated Rb could be inherited and lent support to the two-hit hypothesis. This states that only one working allele of a <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> is necessary for its function (the mutated gene is recessive), and so both need to be mutated before the cancer phenotype will appear. In the familial form, a mutated allele is inherited along with a normal allele. In this case, should a cell sustain only one mutation in the other RB gene, all Rb in that cell would be ineffective at inhibiting cell cycle progression, allowing cells to divide uncontrollably and eventually become cancerous. Furthermore, as one allele is already mutated in all other somatic cells, the future incidence of cancers in these individuals is observed with linear kinetics. The working allele need not undergo a mutation per se, as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is frequently observed in such tumours.|$|E
25|$|The pRb {{protein is}} inactivated by E7 in HPV+OPC, but in HPV-OPC {{it is the}} p16 tumour {{suppressor}} part of the pRb tumour suppressor network that is inactivated. Also the pRb pathway is inactivated by E7 instead of Cyclin D1 amplification. CDKN2A is a <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> that encodes a tumor suppressor protein, p16 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) and inhibits the kinase activity of the cyclin-dependant kinases CDK4 and CDK6, which in turn induce cell cycle arrest. p16 expression is cell cycle dependent and is expressed focally in only about 5–10% of normal squamous epithelium. Like most HPV+ cancers, HPV+OPC express p16 but the latter does not function as a tumour-suppressor, because the mechanism by which this is achieved, pRb, has been inactivated by E7. p16 is upregulated (over-expressed) due to E7-related loss of pRB with reduced negative feedback, whereas it is downregulated in up to 90% of HPV-OPC. This diffuse over-expression in the tumour cells provides a diagnostic marker for HPV involvement. Although HPV E6 and E7 reduce tumour suppressor activity, they do so less than genetic and epigenetic processes do in HPV-OPC.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> NF1 encodes a Ras-GAP [...] its {{mutation}} in neurofibromatosis {{will mean that}} Ras {{is less likely to}} be inactivated. Ras can also be amplified, although this only occurs occasionally in tumours.|$|E
50|$|Sequentially ordered {{mutations}} {{accumulate in}} driver <b>genes,</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes,</b> and DNA repair enzymes, resulting in clonal expansion of tumour cells.

40|$|Cancer is a multistep {{process that}} {{involves}} mutations and other alterations in oncogenes and <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> Genome sequencing studies {{have identified a}} large collection of genetic alterations that occur in human cancers. However, the determination of which mutations are causally related to tumorigenesis remains a major challenge. Here we describe a novel CRISPR/Cas 9 -based approach for rapid functional investigation of candidate genes in well-established autochthonous mouse models of cancer. Using a Kras[superscript G 12 D]-driven lung cancer model, we performed functional characterization of a panel of <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> with known loss-of-function alterations in human lung cancer. Cre-dependent somatic activation of oncogenic Kras[superscript G 12 D] combined with CRISPR/Cas 9 -mediated genome editing of <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> resulted in lung adenocarcinomas with distinct histopathological and molecular features. This rapid somatic genome engineering approach enables functional characterization of putative cancer genes in the lung and other tissues using autochthonous mouse models. We anticipate that this approach {{can be used to}} systematically dissect the complex catalogue of mutations identified in cancer genome sequencing studies.

A flaw in the APC gene means APC is not as effective as it should be, and over time it is likely that some cells that should have been controlled by APC will not be, and will instead continue to develop and become cancerous.

40|$|Epigenetic {{silencing}} of <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> is {{an important}} mechanism involved in cell transformation and tumour progression. The Set and RING-finger-associated domain-containing protein UHRF 1 might be an important link between different epigenetic pathways. Here, we report that UHRF 1 is frequently overexpressed in human prostate tumours and has {{an important role in}} prostate cancer pathogenesis and progression. Analysis of human prostate cancer samples by microarrays and immunohistochemistry showed increased expression of UHRF 1 in about half of the cases. Moreover, UHRF 1 expression was associated with reduced overall survival after prostatectomy in patients with organ-confined prostate tumours (P< 0. 0001). UHRF 1 expression was negatively correlated with several <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> and positively with the histone methyltransferase (HMT) EZH 2 both in prostate tumours and cell lines. UHRF 1 knockdown reduced proliferation, clonogenic capability and anchorage-independent growth of prostate cancer cells. Depletion of UHRF 1 resulted in reactivation of several <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> Gene reactivation upon UHRF 1 depletion was associated with changes in histone H 3 K 9 methylation, acetylation and DNA methylation, and impaired binding of the H 3 K 9 HMT Suv 39 H 1 to the promoter of silenced genes. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed direct interaction between UHRF 1 and Suv 39 H 1. Our data support the notion that UHRF 1, along with Suv 39 H 1 and DNA methyltransferases, contributes to epigenetic gene silencing in prostate tumours. This could represent a parallel and convergent pathway to the H 3 K 27 methylation catalyzed by EZH 2 to synergistically promote inactivation of <b>tumour</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> Deregulated expression of UHRF 1 is involved in the prostate cancer pathogenesis and might represent a useful marker to distinguish indolent cancer from those at high risk of lethal progressio...|$|R
