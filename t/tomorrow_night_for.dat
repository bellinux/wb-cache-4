The Linking Ring, a publication of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, highlighted him in their 1951 February issue. Talk show host Dick Cavett wrote about his first meeting with Slydini in a New York Times column, [...] "Doug Henning said to me, ‘Tony’s doing a special demonstration <b>for</b> some magicians <b>tomorrow</b> <b>night</b> at Vesuvio restaurant. Come.’ <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>night</b> finally came. <b>For</b> the magicians, sitting for nearly two hours at that table, sudden gasps and intakes of breath abounded. It was like seeing a man walk up a wall. Nothing prepared you for it. Right at the start, a solid, heavy silver dollar, held before my eyes, vanished into thinnest air. And by no method I knew of. Certainly no sleeves. The two hours flew too quickly." ...|$|R

All the girls are pissed that New York returned to the house, because a lot of them don't like or get along with New York. Flav leaves the girls alone and New York asks the girls about each other and Bootz lets New York know that she doesn't like her and doesn't want her there and that she's just another bitch trying to steal her man. New York and Bootz get into an argument, where New York calls Bootz a [...] "dreamer" [...] meaning she's just dreaming of Flav being her man. The next day, the girls wake up and are told to go to a photoshoot for URB Magazine. New York is in charge of how the women look. New York is yelling at everybody because they were late and screams to them to come down stairs. New York gets into an argument with Bootz when Bootz is late coming downstairs for the evaluation. New York has rude things to say to all of them except Deelishis and Beautful.|$|R
