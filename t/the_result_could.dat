5|$|Returning to {{differential}} equations, Hamming studied {{means of}} numerically integrating them. A popular approach {{at the time}} was Milne's Method, attributed to Arthur Milne. This had the drawback of being unstable, so that under certain conditions <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>could</b> be swamped by roundoff noise. Hamming developed an improved version, the Hamming predictor-corrector. This was in use for many years, but has since been superseded by the Adams method. He did extensive research into digital filters, devising a new filter, the Hamming window, and eventually writing an entire book on the subject, Digital Filters (1977).|$|E

25|$|Diagnostic testing: Diagnostic {{testing is}} used to {{diagnose}} or rule out a specific genetic or chromosomal condition. In many cases, genetic testing {{is used to}} confirm a diagnosis when a particular condition is suspected based on physical mutations and symptoms. Diagnostic testing can be performed {{at any time during}} a person's life, but is not available for all genes or all genetic conditions. The results of a diagnostic test can influence a person's choices about health care and the management of the disease. For example, people with a family history of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) who experience pain or tenderness in their abdomen, blood in their urine, frequent urination, pain in the sides, a urinary tract infection or kidney stones may decide to have their genes tested and <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>could</b> confirm the diagnosis of PKD.|$|E
25|$|The {{first report}} of {{mycorrhizal}} inhibition of decomposition was in 1971 and came from ectomycorrhizal Pinus radiatia plantations in New Zealand. Authors show that excluding roots and mycorrhizal fungi resulted in net carbon loss, and that <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>could</b> {{not be explained}} by soil disturbance effects. The mechanism presented is that ectomycorrhizal fungi can compete with free-living decomposers for nutrients, and thereby limit the rate of total decomposition. Since then {{there have been several}} other reports of ectomycorrhizal fungi reducing activity and decomposition rates of free-living decomposers and thereby increasing soil carbon storage. A theoretical ecosystem model recently demonstrated that greater access to organic nitrogen by mycorrhizal fungi should slow decomposition of soil carbon by free-living decomposers by inducing nutrient limitation. It should be noted however, that Koide and Wu (2003) made a strong case that the effect of ectomycorrhizal fungi on reducing decomposition may {{have more to do with}} competition for soil water than soil nutrients.|$|E

25|$|February: The {{new manager}} {{continued}} attempting {{to strengthen the}} squad throughout February, with loan signings Albert Jarrett and Luke Medley from Lincoln and Mansfield respectively, though neither had a large impact on the team with {{only a handful of}} appearances between them. Holdsworth also signed former Shots goalkeeper Mikhael Jaimez-Ruiz, who made 62 appearances in a previous spell at the club. On the pitch, Aldershot went on a run of five consecutive draws, the first away to league leaders Chesterfield who required a later equaliser to rescue a point. An away stalemate at Morecambe was followed by consecutive home draws against Macclesfield and Lincoln. After a further draw against Northampton the Shots were finally beaten by a strong Port Vale side pushing for promotion, though <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>could</b> have been different if Anthony Charles hadn't missed a penalty.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{outbreak}} of the English Civil War in 1642, no English troops were available to put down the uprising and the rebels were left in control of most of Ireland. The Catholic majority briefly ruled the country as Confederate Ireland (1642–1649) during the subsequent Wars of the Three Kingdoms in Britain and Ireland. The Confederate regime allied themselves with Charles I and the English Royalists, though they did not sign a formal treaty with them until 1649. Had the Royalists won the English Civil War, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>could</b> have been an autonomous Catholic ruled Ireland. However, the Royalists were defeated by the Parliamentarians, Charles I was executed and Oliver Cromwell re-conquered Ireland in 1649–1653 on behalf of the English Commonwealth. The Cromwellian conquest of Ireland was marked by atrocities, such as the massacre of the Royalist garrison at the Siege of Drogheda in 1649. Another policy implemented by the Cromwellian regime was the deportation of prisoners of war to the West Indies. Even worse was a scorched earth policy carried out by Parliamentarian commanders to subdue Irish guerrilla fighters, which caused famine throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|Next (or in {{the opinion}} of some, first) in {{importance}} stand the memoirs on celestial mechanics, in which he proved himself a worthy successor to Pierre-Simon Laplace. The most important of these are his memoirs Sur les inégalités séculaires des moyens mouvements des planètes, Sur la variation des constantes arbitraires dans les questions de mécanique, both published in the Journal of the École Polytechnique (1809); Sur la libration de la lune, in Connaissance des temps (1821), etc.; and , in Mémoires de l'Académie (1827), etc. In the first of these memoirs, Poisson discusses the famous question of the stability of the planetary orbits, which had already been settled by Lagrange to the first degree of approximation for the disturbing forces. Poisson showed that <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>could</b> be extended to a second approximation, and thus made an important advance in planetary theory. The memoir is remarkable inasmuch as it roused Lagrange, after an interval of inactivity, to compose in his old age one of the greatest of his memoirs, entitled Sur la théorie des variations des éléments des planètes, et en particulier des variations des grands axes de leurs orbites. So highly did he think of Poisson's memoir that he made a copy of it with his own hand, which was found among his papers after his death. Poisson made important contributions to the theory of attraction.|$|E

25|$|To Spain and the Teutonic {{countries}} of Europe {{we look for}} the most important object of church decoration, the retable; the Reformation accounting for the absence in England of any work of this iec kind. The magnificent altar-piece in Schleswig cathedral was carved by Hans Bruggerman, and consists, like many others, {{of a number of}} panels filled with figures standing some four or five deep. The figures in the foremost rows are carved entirely separate, and stand out by themselves, while the background is composed of figure work and architecture, etc., in diminishing perspective. The panels are grouped together under canopy work forming one harmonious whole. The genius of this great carver shows itself in the large variety of the facial expression of those wonderful figures all instinct with life and movement, In France few retables exist outside the museums. In the little church of Marissel, not far from Beauvais, there is a retable consisting of eleven panels, the crucifixion being, of course, the principal subject. And there is a beautiful example from Antwerp in the Muse Cluny, Paris; the pierced tracery work which decorates the upper part being {{a good example of the}} style composed of interlacing segments of circles so common on the Continent during late Gothic times and but seldom practised in England. ln Spain the cathedral of Valladolid was famous for its retable, and Alonso Cano and other sculptors frequently used wood for large statuary, which was painted in a very realistic way with the most startlingly lifelike effect. Denmark also possessed a school of able wood-carvers who imitated the great altar-pieces of Germany. A very large and well-carved example still exists in the cathedral of Roskilde. But besides these great altarpieces tiny little models were carved on a scale the minuteness of which staggers the beholder. Triptychs and shrines, etc., measuring but a few inches were filled in with tracery and figures that excite the utmost wonder. In the British Museum there is such a triptych (Flemish, I 511); the center panel, measuring an inch or two square, is crowded with figures in full relief and in diminishing perspective, after the custom of this period. This rests on a semicircular base which is carved with the Lord's Supper, and is further ornamented with figures and animals. The whole thing inclusive measures about 9 in. high, and, with the triptych wings open, 5 in. wide. The extraordinary delicacy and minuteness of detail of this microscopic work baffle description. There is another such a piece, also Flemish, in the Wallace collection, which rivals that just referred to in rni& applied talent. For, marvellous as these works of art are, they fail to satisfy. They make ones eyes ache, they worry one as to how <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>could</b> ever have been obtained, and after the first astonishment one must ever feel that the same work of art on a scale large enough for a cathedral could have been carved with half the labor.|$|E
500|$|Writer and {{academic}} Thomas Owens stated that characteristics of Silver's solos were: [...] "the short, simple phrases that all {{derive from the}} three-beat figure ♩ ♩ | ♩, or a variant of it; the pianist's 'blue fifth' (those rapid slurs up to [...] ); and the low tone cluster used strictly as a rhythmic punctuation". He also employed blues and minor pentatonic scales. Music journalist Marc Myers observed that [...] "Silver's advantage was pianistic grace and a keen awareness that by resolving dark, minor-passages in airy, ascending and descending major-key chord configurations, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>could</b> produce an exciting and uplifting feeling." [...] In his accompanying of a soloing saxophonist or trumpeter, Silver was also distinctive: [...] "Rather than reacting to the soloist's melody and waiting for melodic holes to fill, he typically plays background patterns similar to the background riffs that saxes or brasses play behind soloists in big bands." ...|$|E
500|$|Game four {{was played}} in Vancouver. Team Canada was {{surprised}} to find that the crowd booed Canada during the warm-up and cheered louder for the Soviets during the game's introduction. The game started with two consecutive penalties by Bill Goldsworthy and Boris Mikhailov scored power play goals on both penalties to give the Soviets a 2–0 lead. Goldsworthy, who had started in place of Wayne Cashman, wanted to replace Cashman's truculence, but only hurt his team and was criticized privately by Sinden. In the second, Gilbert Perreault scored on a Soviet own-goal to get Canada within one goal, but Blinov scored less than a minute later to restore the two-goal lead. Rod Gilbert scored a questionable goal that was disallowed and Canada's protests went unheeded. To Sinden, that was the turning point of the game, and <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>could</b> have been different had the goal been allowed, although Sinden admitted that it was [...] "a beating." [...] Vikulov scored to put the Soviets ahead 4–1 after two periods. In the third, Goldsworthy made partial amends to get Canada to 4–2, but Shadrin scored to put the game out of reach. Dennis Hull scored in the final minute to make it closer, but it was too late.|$|E

2500|$|While {{continuing}} to choose her subjects from her immediate urban environment, Fish changed her approach roughly {{at the turn}} of the century. Closely observed objects such as sections of floor tile and asphalt siding gave way to abstractly rendered thresholds, stairs and stair landings, a light fixture, and floor plans of rooms in her home. Like her earlier work, these paintings, she said, were impressed on the surface of the canvas in a way that approximated the experience of seeing the same things over and over, day after day. She came to see transitions as the subject of her work, the sense of walking across a threshold, moving from room to room; or the sense of light moving through a room during the day and into it from a wall fixture at night. She understood such transitions to be both actual and metaphorical. The visual elements she put on her canvases were meant to convey physical objects but also her own motion through the spaces they represented and the light that came from fixtures in the rooms and through the windows. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>could</b> be seen, as one reviewer said, [...] "as a thoughtful meditation on the nature of occupancy within a domestic environment, exactingly rendered in multiple paint layers." ...|$|E

Warner {{played a major role in}} organising cricket during the war as, with other MCC staff joining the services, he took on the Secretary's duties under the title of [...] "Deputy Assistant Secretary". His first priority was to work with the Royal Air Force (RAF) who occupied most of the Lord's estate including the practice ground and all buildings. The playing area was unaffected and the pavilion and the stands were always available for cricket; Warner paid tribute to the RAF authorities for their considerable help in enabling him to organise matches. Numerous ad hoc clubs and teams were formed, mostly based on the services.
