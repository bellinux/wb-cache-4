5000|$|Before the {{widespread}} use of non-linear editing systems, the initial editing of all films was done with a positive copy of the film negative called a film workprint (cutting copy in UK) by physically cutting and pasting together pieces of film. Strips of footage would be hand cut and attached together with tape and then later in time, glue. Editors were very precise; if they made a wrong cut or needed a fresh positive print, it cost them money for the lab to reprint the footage and push the editing process back farther. With the invention of a splicer and <b>threading</b> <b>machine</b> with a viewer such as a Moviola, or [...] "flatbed" [...] machine such as a K.-E.-M. or Steenbeck, the editing process sped up a little bit and cut came out cleaner and more precise.|$|E

Given this graph, one can assess for two emails what is the likelihood that one caused or triggered the other. Finally, using the causality graph, we find the most likely thread structure for each user’s inbound mail stream.

These traces show how a request is processed as it passes through several modules which may be processes, <b>threads,</b> <b>machines,</b> or devices.

5000|$|Dominant - The element or {{stimulus}} {{that determines}} all subsequent and subordinate elements or stimuli. For films that implement Montage Theory, these dominant elements are determined prior to shooting and inform {{the script and}} editing process. Not all dominants are singular elements (lighting, allusion, timing, etc.) but can be the product or sum total of all stimulants. For example, in The General Line, Eisenstein determined dominant stimulants based on the composition of single shots [...] "by the method of 'democratic' equal rights for all the stimulants, viewed together as a complex". This was Eisenstein's attempt to parallel Japanese Kabuki theater, which composed movement in a simultaneously fragmented but hierarchal fashion. More frequently, however, dominants took overt and singular form. In Man with a Movie Camera, Vertov constructs one sequence- scarcely definable as a “scene”- through the dominant movement of circularity, displaying industrial <b>threading</b> <b>machines</b> and human movements that performed circularly.|$|R

50|$|Typically, an {{electric}} motor is mechanically connected to rotate a lead screw. A lead screw has a continuous helical <b>thread</b> <b>machined</b> on its circumference running along the length (similar to the thread on a bolt). Threaded onto the lead screw is a lead nut or ball nut with corresponding helical threads. The nut is prevented from rotating with the lead screw (typically the nut interlocks with a non-rotating part of the actuator body). Therefore, when the lead screw is rotated, the nut will be driven along the threads. The direction of motion of the nut depends on the direction of rotation of the lead screw. By connecting linkages to the nut, the motion {{can be converted to}} usable linear displacement. Most current actuators are built for high speed, high force, or a compromise between the two. When considering an actuator for a particular application, the most important specifications are typically travel, speed, force, accuracy, and lifetime. Most varieties are mounted on dampers or butterfly valves.|$|R
