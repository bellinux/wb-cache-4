2500|$|On one occasion, as Stephen was mopping {{the kitchen}} floor with a cloth, Rose accidentally stepped into the bowl of water he had been using to perform this task. In response, Rose smashed the boy {{over the head with}} the bowl, then {{repeatedly}} kicked him in the head and chest as she shouted: [...] "You did that on purpose, you little swine!" [...] On another occasion, Rose became hysterical at a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting light scour marks to Mae's chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae had screamed, [...] "No, Mum! No, Mum!" [...] as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing. Even Fred occasionally became the recipient of Rose's violence. On one occasion in the late 1970s, Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand, although Fred was able to slam shut the door of the room into which he had run as Rose plunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and Rose's fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them from her hand. In response, Rose calmly wrapped her hand in a towel and said: [...] "Look what you done, fella. You've got <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hospital now." ...|$|E

60|$|Richard {{came back}} as we {{finished}} exchanging these hurried words {{and gave me}} his arm <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coach.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she answered, looking gravely at his tousled {{hair and}} {{blinking}} gray eyes. [...] "Have you come <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Hugson's Ranch?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, what is it, Louis?" [...] I asked. [...] "Are you repenting of your offer already? Don't {{you want}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> this other place?" ...|$|R
60|$|But they've come <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of Mount Royal, {{it being}} a cold, dry, sunny, {{magnificent}} day. Going in a sleigh.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{have come}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flower-show," [...] she said. [...] "One word, mamma, before I go. I have not distressed you, have I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Park," [...] Miss Fancourt {{observed}} to Overt with elation {{as they passed}} along the corridor {{that led to the}} street.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not half enough!" [...] Emily answered. [...] "Your story leaves {{off just}} at the {{interesting}} moment. I want you <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Sir Jervis's house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of one's being married, of course,--I {{suppose you}} know what that is. No one must know {{anything}} about it. I want you <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Europe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{declared}} Black, thickly. [...] "Couldn't {{strike a}} job nohow when I left them. British Columbia played out--and I {{had no money}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> California." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the morning}} of my {{departure}} I stood on the porch with old Peter waiting {{for the arrival of}} the mail driver, who was <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearest railroad town.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Violet, [...] "if you won't go to Lady Baldock's {{or to the}} Zoo, we must confine {{ourselves}} to Laura's drawing-room;--unless, indeed, you like <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the Monument." ...|$|E
60|$|But now my {{mind was}} filled with only one thought. The three men {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Darbyville jail. I was to be ignominiously dragged back to the prison from which I had escaped.|$|E
5000|$|In another {{outburst}} on 22 December, Bainimarama {{demanded that}} civil servants like Korovavala and Jale {{stop trying to}} [...] "intimidate" [...] the military. [...] "Jale and Korovavala have been trying <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> task," [...] he said. [...] "I challenge them <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> task {{in front of the}} Public Service Commission. Go ahead and make my day," [...] the Fiji Times reported. In the same press conference, the commander reiterated that the military would do all in its power to prevent the Unity Bill from becoming law.|$|R
6000|$|Letta {{was puzzled}} by this reply. She raised her bright eyes inquiringly into Robin's honest face, and said, [...] "But you've promised <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> her, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{not sell}} me, but ask the king <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> his stable, and feed me there; then his other horses will become just as {{beautiful}} as I.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what's {{so funny}} in you, you start {{laughing}} just when one doesn't expect you to. And if I make you that unhappy why d'you want <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pavilion? I'm {{quite ready to}} go home." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{what good}} will that do, when--Tom, Tom, we must move Heaven and earth for petitions. I'll take them up myself, and get George Rivers <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Home Secretary. Never fear, while there's justice in Heaven.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I want you, Miss Emily, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British Museum. Don't let me startle you! When I called here {{earlier in}} the day, I was told that you {{had gone to the}} reading-room. Is your reading a secret?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And, while I live, if I {{do my best}} to lead a good life, and if my last prayer <b>to</b> God is <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> heaven, shall I be heard?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] she said, abruptly. [...] "I {{want you}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Olympia's--Olympia Johns' flat. I've been reading all the Balzac there is. I want to talk. Can you come?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Hurd {{is going}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> some friends of his," [...] she answered. [...] "You {{see it was}} his fault, so he has promised to see mother and explain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I got Mrs. Twemlow <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> museum {{while you}} were talking to the butler. It was dreadful to feel that it was lying there in the open waiting for {{somebody}} to take it, {{and not be able to}} do anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{performed}} that promise. He {{showed me}} the clothing, which I resolutely put on; the letters, which I put into my pocket. He made no objection, then {{took me to the}} commandant, who heard my story and coldly ordered Briscoe <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> guardhouse. On the way I said: ...|$|E
60|$|Smalleyville {{was a good}} {{ten miles}} from the {{misplaced}} bridge, and in a soaking rain such a distance was too far to walk. Perhaps I might get a carriage <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spot. I supposed the cost would be several dollars, but decided not to stand on that amount.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Polly, hastening to explain; [...] "you see, my aunt Maria {{has been}} so good as <b>to</b> offer <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> live with her and put <b>me</b> <b>to</b> school." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have the}} magic belt, you know," [...] said the little girl. [...] "If I buckled it {{around my waist}} and {{commanded}} it <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Uncle Henry, wouldn't it do it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad you}} like it, for I want you <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{one of the}} new concerts some night. I really need some music <b>to</b> put <b>me</b> in tune. Will you, please?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Invisible Presence read my thought. I felt my lips touched, as my husband's lips used {{to touch}} them when he kissed me. And that was my answer. A thought came to me again. I would have said, if I could have spoken: [...] "Are you here <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> better world?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{knew from}} the {{direction}} of our march that they were taking me to Phutra. Once there I did not need much of an imagination to picture what my fate would be. It was the arena and a wild thag or fierce tarag for me--unless the Mahars elected <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pits.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Mr. Conant, [...] "I merely {{wanted to}} get the car in shape. You are <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station on Monday morning. Under the {{circumstances}} we will not use Morrison's car for pleasure rides, but only for convenience in getting from here to the trains and back. He surely cannot object to that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Go away, you yellow devil. I {{know you}} have come <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> hell, but you are too soon, and if my hands were loose I would twist your head off your shoulders.' ...|$|R
60|$|ANN. [pouncing on {{her mother}} joyously] Oh, mamma, what do you think! Jack is going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Nice in his motor car. Isn't it lovely? I am the happiest person in London.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean to be}} cool;--I'm always cool. The cab will be here <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{dinner in}} a very few minutes. I hope you will not think I am running away from you?" ...|$|R
