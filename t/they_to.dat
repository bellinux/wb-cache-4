25|$|In Pushkin's time, {{the early}} 19th century, duels were very {{strictly}} regulated. A second's primary duty was {{to prevent the}} duel from actually happening, and only when both combatants were unwilling to stand down were <b>they</b> <b>to</b> {{make sure that the}} duel proceeded according to formalised rules. A challenger's second should therefore always ask the challenged party if he wants to apologise for his actions that have led to the challenge.|$|E

25|$|Rivalries {{between the}} zaque and the zipa were taken {{advantage}} of by the Spaniards as they conquered {{the heart of what}} would be Colombia. Some of them, such as Sebastián de Belalcázar, Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, and Nicolás de Federman, interested in locating El Dorado, discovered the rich plains of Cundinamarca and Boyacá. The presence of the Spaniards gave hope to both sovereigns that, were <b>they</b> <b>to</b> prevail in a war against the Spaniards, could make one Confederation. But the Spaniards prevailed.|$|E

25|$|After these insults, the {{government}} passed the Renunciation Act of 1944, {{a law that}} made it possible for Nisei and Kibei to renounce their American citizenship. A total of 5,589 internees opted to do so; 5,461 of these were sent to Tule Lake. Of those who renounced US citizenship, 1,327 were repatriated to Japan. Those persons who stayed in the US faced discrimination from the Japanese-American community, both during and after the war, for having made that choice of renunciation. At the time, they feared what their futures held were <b>they</b> <b>to</b> remain American, and remain interned.|$|E

They were joined in the first episode by two of Foreman's schoolteachers, Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell), from contemporary 20th century England. This remained the line-up of the series for the entire first season, but over time the regular line-up would change regularly as the Doctor's various companions left him to return home, having found new causes on worlds they had visited and elected to stay there, or even occasionally being killed off. However, he would always quickly find new travelling companions. Such characters were used by the production team to relate {{the point of view}} of the viewers at home, asking questions and furthering the stories by getting into trouble.|$|E

She rejected all claims of non-perceptual or a priori knowledge, including [...] "'instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing. Rand argued that the requirements of cognition determine the objective criteria of conceptualization, which she summarized {{in the form of a}} philosophical razor. Known as [...] "Rand's razor," [...] it states that [...] "concepts are not to be multiplied beyond necessity—the corollary of which is: nor are <b>they</b> <b>to</b> be integrated in disregard of necessity". [...] In her Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic–synthetic dichotomy.|$|E
500|$|Garrett's 11-year-old son Richard was an eyewitness. In later years, {{he became}} a Baptist {{minister}} and widely lectured on the events of Booth's demise at his family's farm. In 1921, Garrett's lecture {{was published in the}} Confederate Veteran as the [...] "True Story of the Capture of John Wilkes Booth." [...] According to his account, Booth and Herold arrived at the Garretts' farm, located on the road to Bowling Green, around 3p.m. on Monday afternoon. Confederate mail delivery had ceased {{with the collapse of the}} Confederate government, he explained, so the Garretts were unaware of Lincoln's assassination. After having dinner with the Garretts that evening, Booth learned of the surrender of Johnston's army, the last Confederate armed force of any size. Its capitulation meant that the Civil War was unquestionably over and Booth's attempt had failed to save the Confederacy by Lincoln's assassination. The Garretts also finally learned of Lincoln's death and the substantial reward for Booth's capture. Booth, said Garrett, displayed no reaction other than to ask if the family would turn in the fugitive should they have the opportunity. Still not aware of their guest's true identity, one of the older Garrett sons averred that they might, if only because they needed the money. The next day, Booth told the Garretts that he intended to reach Mexico, drawing a route on a map of theirs. Biographer Theodore Roscoe said of Garrett's account, [...] "Almost nothing written or testified in respect to the doings of the fugitives at Garrett's farm can be taken at face value. Nobody knows exactly what Booth said to the Garretts, or <b>they</b> <b>to</b> him." [...] Garrett was present at the time and was more likely to know the facts than later biographers.|$|E
