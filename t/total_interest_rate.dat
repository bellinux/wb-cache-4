Despite the presumed rigidity of currency boards, the currency premium is almost always positive and at times very large. Its term structure is usually upward sloping, but flattens out or even becomes inverted at times of turbulence. The premium and its term structure depend on domestic and global factors, related to devaluation expectations and risk perceptions...|$|E

5000|$|Keynes {{argued that}} {{employment}} depends on total spending, which {{is composed of}} consumer spending and business investment in the private sector. Consumers only spend [...] "passively", or according to their income fluctuations. Businesses, on the other hand, are induced to invest by the expected {{rate of return on}} new investments (the benefit) and the <b>rate</b> of <b>interest</b> paid (the cost). So, said Keynes, if business expectations remained the same, and government reduces <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> (the costs of borrowing), investment would increase, and would have a multiplied effect on <b>total</b> spending. <b>Interest</b> <b>rates,</b> in turn, depend on the quantity of money and the desire to hold money in bank accounts (as opposed to investing). If not enough money is available to match how much people want to hold, <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> rise until enough people are put off. So if the quantity of money were increased, while the desire to hold money remained stable, <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> would fall, leading to increased investment, output and employment. For both these reasons, Keynes therefore advocated low <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and easy credit, to combat unemployment.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a first attempt at {{evaluating}} the determinants of the <b>total</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> differentials on government bonds between high yielders, namely Italy, Spain, Sweden and Germany. In particular we {{address the question of}} the relative importance of local and global factors in the determination of such spreads. We identify and measure two components of total yield differentials: one due to expectations of exchange rate depreciation [...] which we call the exchange rate factor [...] another which reflects the market assessment of default risk. We propose and discuss a measure of the exchange rate factors and of the default risk premium based on interest rate swaps. Overall our investigation provides strong evidence in favor of the existence of a common trend for the Italian and Spanish spreads on Bunds, which is not shared by the Swedish spread. Such a trend is driven by international factors and is independent from country- specific shocks. Country-specific shocks are only relevant in explaining short term cycles around the common stochastic trend. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} mainly {{motivated}} {{by the fact that}} there is a lack of research on interest rate risk of the property/liability (P/L) insurance industry. Unexpected changes in interest (or inflation) rates may severely jeopardize insurers ’ survivability. Unless they properly manage their assets and liabilities, the potential impact of changes in interest rates on P/L insurer’s investment revenue, profitability, and surplus may be so large that insurers may become insolvent. To measure IRRs, a <b>total</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity taking account of duration and convexity is operationalized. Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a security’s price to interest rate changes, and convexity is the change in duration with respect to changes in interest rates. The result of the investigation of the sample insurers’ surplus sensitivity shows that the sample insurers in general do not adopt surplus immunization management. Given the asset and liability sensitivities, the sample insurers may not be able to practice surplus immunization management. The results of regression analyses provide evidence for some systematic relationships between surplus sensitivity and firm characteristics...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse, in a contingent-claims framework, {{one of the}} most common life {{insurance}} policies sold in Italy during the last two decades. The policy, of the endowment type, is initially priced as a standard one, given a mortality table and a technical interest rate. Subsequently, at the end of each policy year, the insurance company grants a bonus, which is credited to the mathematical reserve and depends on the performance of a special investment portfolio. More precisely, this bonus is determined in such a way that the <b>total</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> credited to the insured equals a given percen-tage (participation level) of the annual return on the reference portfolio and anyway does not fall below the technical rate (minimum interest rate guaran-teed, henceforth). Moreover, if the contract is paid by periodical premiums, it is usually stated that the annual premium is adjusted at the same rate of the bonus, and thus the benefit is also adjusted in the same measure. In such policy the variables controlled by the insurance company (control-variables, henceforth) are the technical rate, the participation level and, in some sense, the riskiness of the reference portfolio measured by its volatility. However, as it is intuitive, not all sets of values for these variables give rise to a fair contract, i. e. to a contract priced consistently with the usual assump-tions on financial markets and, in particular, with no-arbitrage. We derive then necessary and sufficient conditions under which each control-variable is determined by a fair pricing of the contract, given the remaining two ones...|$|E

40|$|Prices of U. S. Treasury {{securities}} vary {{over time}} and across maturities. When the market in Treasurys is sufficiently complete and frictionless, these prices may be modeled by a function time and maturity. A cross-section of this function for time held fixed is called the yield curve; the aggregate of these sections is {{the evolution of the}} yield curve. This dissertation studies aspects of this evolution. ^ There are two complementary approaches to the study of yield curve evolution here. The first is principal components analysis; the second is wavelet analysis. In both approaches both the time and maturity variables are discretized. In principal components analysis the vectors of yield curve shifts are viewed as observations of a multivariate normal distribution. The resulting covariance matrix is diagonalized; the resulting eigenvalues and eigenvectors (the principal components) are used to draw inferences about the yield curve evolution. ^ In wavelet analysis, the vectors of shifts are resolved into hierarchies of localized fundamental shifts (wavelets) that leave specified global properties invariant (average change and duration change). The hierarchies relate to the degree of localization with movements restricted to a single maturity at the base and general movements at the apex. Second generation wavelet techniques allow better adaptation of the model to economic observables. Statistically, the wavelet approach is inherently nonparametric while the wavelets themselves are better adapted to describing a complete market. ^ Principal components analysis provides information on the dimension of the yield curve process. While there is no clear demarkation between operative factors and noise, the top six principal components pick up 99 % of <b>total</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> variation 95 % of the time. An economically justified basis of this process is hard to find; for example a simple linear model will not suffice for the first principal component and the shape of this component is nonstationary. ^ Wavelet analysis works more directly with yield curve observations than principal components analysis. In fact the complete process from bond data to multiresolution is presented, including the dedicated Perl programs and the details of the portfolio metrics and specially adapted wavelet construction. The result is more robust statistics which provide balance to the more fragile principal components analysis. ...|$|E

While these bank characteristics are important in explaining bank risk we also find that civil-law country banks tend to be less risky than common-law country banks over the period of the study. Finally there is evidence of a decrease in importance of bank charter value and an increase in the importance of off-balance sheet activities for bank risk in the post- EMU period. These results are robust to various estimation specifications...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the paper is to {{estimate}} market, <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and exchange rate risk of Greek financial institutions and to explore the relationship between market-based measures of risk and accounting variables {{before and after the}} adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in order to examine whether IFRS introduction enhances the information content of accounting data. Empirical results reveal that all banks are exposed to market risk while <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and exchange rate risk affect them occasionally. Moreover, the IFRS introduction reinforces the explanatory ability of accounting data, on systematic and non-systematic risks. Concerning the risk-relevance of accounting ratios, liquidity measures, credibility, earnings per share and provisions for credit loss are inversely related to systematic and non-systematic risks under IFRS. Moreover, loans to <b>total</b> assets ratio, <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> spread and income diversification are directly associated with market measures of risk, while bank size is negatively related to both risk measures under IFRS. Our findings imply that the fair value orientation of IFRS is responsible for the higher risk-relevance of fundamentals as opposed to the historically oriented Greek Accounting Standards (GAS).

Targeting inflation directly requires that the central bank (SARB) form forecasts of the likely path of prices {{paying close attention to}} a variety of indicators that shows the predictive power of inflation in the past periods. Inflation indicators might be cointegrated with the rate of inflation to predict the future inflation rates.
