40|$|The study {{identified}} {{practical skills}} possessed by woodwork graduates of Niger state technical colleges in using woodworking machines, hand tools and consumables. Three research questions were answered and two hypotheses tested at 0. 05 level of significance. A survey research design was adopted for the study. A structured questionnaire {{was used to}} gather data from one hundred and two respondents. Simple random sampling was applied to identify the study sample. Mean rating was used to answer research questions, t- test statistics {{was used to test}} the hypotheses. Cronbach Alpa Formula was used to determine reliability coefficient of the instrument. The reliability coefficient of the instrument was found to 0. 81. The findings of the study showed that Woodwork graduates of technical colleges in Niger State used all the woodworking machines listed except band saw machine, <b>tenoning</b> <b>machine,</b> mortiser and thicknesser. They used all the hand tools such as hammer, screw driver, hand plane, electric jig saw, scraper, pincer, plier, try square and spanner. It was recommended that State Government should provide modern machines for improving practical skills of woodwork students and Woodwork teachers should teach students how to apply formica on wood surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”TENON {{machining}} is {{an important}} and major processing for aero-engine precision forging blade. Traditional processing methods for <b>TENON</b> <b>machining</b> cannot meet the modern aero-engine performance, efficiency and environmental protection needs. In the paper, a "hard " clamping process method to <b>machine</b> blade <b>TENON</b> is proposed, and the key technologies of the method, fixture layout optimization and deformation controlling, are discussed in detail. Finally, we introduce specific scheme that designed a set of hydraulic special fixture with adaptive auxiliary support to realize "hard " clamping processing.

40|$|Rectangular {{mortise and tenon}} joints {{have been}} widely used in barns and other {{building}} constructions in this country and other countries for centuries. Round mortise and tenon joints differ from these essentially only in the geometry of the joints, but information is lacking concerning their use in building frame construction. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the use of round mortise and tenon joints in light timber frame construction and to demonstrate potential applications. In order to achieve desired objectives, a low cost <b>tenon</b> cutting <b>machine</b> with steel pipe framework was developed to produce different size and diameter tenons. A simple piece of equipment was also built to trim excess material away from the seats of the tenons. ^ Included with the study were design, development, and testing of mortise and tenon joints, development of a modular construction prototype building frame and, finally an evaluation of the performance characteristics of a small light timber frame constructed with squared timbers and round mortise and tenon joints. ^ Results of the study showed that round mortise and tenon joint construction provides a simple straightforward method of constructing building frames. Erection techniques are simple and only basic tools are needed. Furthermore, standard parts can be manufactured locally by cottage level industry or regionally by major producers. ^ In conclusion, round mortise and tenon joinery provides a means of utilizing waste wood and small diameter material in the construction of useful building frames. Some of the these building frames might be used to satisfy the simple needs for backyard storage sheds in developed countries while others might be used to provide the basic framework for shelters, small farm buildings, and light industrial buildings in developing countries. ...|$|R
