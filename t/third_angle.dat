This allows determination of {{the measure of the}} <b>third</b> <b>angle</b> of any triangle given the measure of two angles. An exterior angle of a triangle is an angle that is a linear pair (and hence supplementary) to an interior angle. The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of {{the measures}} of the two interior angles that are not adjacent to it; this is the exterior angle theorem. The sum of the measures of the three exterior angles (one for each vertex) of any triangle is 360 degrees.|$|E

50|$|Precession is {{a change}} in the {{orientation}} of the rotational axis of a rotating body. In an appropriate reference frame it can be defined as a change in the first Euler <b>angle,</b> whereas the <b>third</b> Euler <b>angle</b> defines the rotation itself. In other words, if the axis of rotation of a body is itself rotating about a second axis, that body is said to be precessing about the second axis. A motion in which the second Euler angle changes is called nutation. In physics, {{there are two types of}} precession: torque-free and torque-induced.|$|R
