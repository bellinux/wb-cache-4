5|$|The Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile <b>Threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, {{also called}} the Rumsfeld Commission, was an {{independent}} commission formed by the US Congress to evaluate the ballistic missile threat posed to the United States.|$|E
5|$|The final {{catalyst}} {{for the expansion of}} the investigation was the Seattle General Strike, which began the day before the Senate passed Resolution 439. This confluence of events led members of Congress to believe that the alleged German-Bolshevist link and Bolshevist <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States were real.|$|E

His {{job was to}} monitor the health and physical fitness of the American troops stationed there. Berg, along with several other OIAA agents, left in June 1943 because they thought South America posed little <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, {{and they wanted to}} be someplace where their talents would be put to better use.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Katrina, 150,000people and 120,000head of cattle in central Cuba were evacuated, {{according to a}} broadcast by Havana radio. As a result, Cuban Civil Defense officers issued a storm alert for five provinces. A hurricane watch was declared for the central and eastern Bahamas. Along the southeast coast of Florida, small craft were advised to remain close to port. However, the storm was not expected to, and did not, pose a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{was partly}} {{demolished}} {{just after the}} war on Churchill's direct orders (and to the great annoyance of the French, who were not consulted), as it was still seen as a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom. It was later reopened by private owners, first in 1969 {{to serve as a}} mushroom farm and subsequently as a museum in 1984. A nature conservation organisation acquired the Fortress of Mimoyecques in 2010 and La Coupole, a former V-2 rocket base turned museum near Saint-Omer, took over its management. It continues to be open to the public as a vast underground museum complex.|$|E

5|$|On 22 June, Germany {{launched}} Operation Barbarossa {{the invasion}} of the Soviet Union; this attack all but removed the German <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom. The British still had to consider the threat of an invasion, due the possibility that the Soviet Union could collapse under the German onslaught, after which Germany could easily transfer troops back to the west. With the arrival of winter in late 1941, the threat of invasion subsided. This, coupled with the production of new equipment for the British army, allowed the War Office to begin steps to better balance the army, due to the large number of infantry units formed during the preceding year and a half; as part of this reform, the County Divisions were disbanded.|$|E

25|$|This {{committee}} was originally concerned with investigating pro-German sentiments in the American liquor industry. After World War I ended in November 1918 and the German threat lessened, the committee began investigating Bolshevism, which had {{appeared as a}} threat during the First Red Scare after the Russian Revolution in 1917. The committee's hearing into Bolshevik propaganda, conducted February 11 to March 10, 1919, had a decisive role in constructing {{an image of a}} radical <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States during the first Red Scare.|$|E

Among his most noteworthy positions was Chairman of the nine-member Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile <b>Threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States from January to July 1998.

In his memoirs, Kennan argued that containment did not demand a militarized U.S. foreign policy. [...] "Counterforce" [...] implied the political and economic defense of Western Europe against the disruptive effect of the war on European society.

500|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the absence of a perceived <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States came drastic cuts in the defense budget. The high cost of maintaining and operating battleships as part of the United States Navy's active fleet became uneconomical; as a result, Wisconsin was decommissioned on 30 September 1991 after 14 total years of active service, and joined the Reserve Fleet at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. [...] She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register (NVR) on 12 January 1995, then on 15 October 1996, she was moved to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, and on 12 February 1998, she was restored to the Naval Vessel Register. On 7 December 2000, the battleship was towed from Portsmouth, Virginia and berthed adjacent to Nauticus, The National Maritime Center in Norfolk. On 16 April 2001 the battleship's weather decks were opened to the public by the Hampton Roads Naval Museum, a U.S. Navy museum charged with Wisconsins interpretation and public visitation. The ship was still owned by the Navy and was considered part of the mothball fleet.|$|E
500|$|As the French Revolution and its {{perceived}} <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom gained momentum, so did Garrow's career; he prosecuted {{in most of}} {{the state}} trials, and as he increased in experience was left to manage many of them himself, coming up against leading barristers such as Thomas Erskine, James Mingay and James Scarlett. In May 1794 the Government suspended habeas corpus, in 1795 outlawed all public meetings, in 1797 outlawed secret organisations and in 1799 outlawed all societies interested in reforming the way the United Kingdom was run. The Government planned a series of 800 arrests, with 300 execution warrants for high treason made out and signed, making a particular effort to prosecute Thomas Hardy and John Horne Tooke. Hardy was the first to be tried, with the prosecution arguing that he sought a revolution in England similar to that in France. With Garrow prosecuting and Erskine defending, the trial lasted eight days instead of the normal one, and the foreman of the jury was so tense that he delivered the verdict of [...] "not guilty" [...] in a whisper and then immediately fainted. Tooke was then prosecuted; again, the jury found him not guilty, with the result that the other 800 trials were abandoned.|$|E
500|$|Bush {{publicly}} condemned Kim Jong-il of North Korea, naming North Korea one {{of three}} states in an [...] "axis of evil", and saying that [...] "the United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons." [...] Within months, [...] "both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.–DPRK Agreed Framework of October 1994." [...] North Korea's October 9, 2006, detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bush's foreign policy, which centered for both terms of his presidency on [...] " [...] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world". Bush condemned North Korea's position, reaffirmed his commitment to [...] "a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula", and stated that [...] "transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities {{would be considered a}} grave <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States", for which North Korea would be held accountable. On May 7, 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account. This was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the United States and including China. On September 2, 2007, North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all of its nuclear programs by the end of 2007. By May 2009, North Korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack South Korea.|$|E
