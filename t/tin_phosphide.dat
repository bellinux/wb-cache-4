40|$|The {{preparation}} and electrochemical structural transformation of a fully reversible new lithium intercalation compound, SnP 0. 94, which exhibits an excellent life-cycle performance, are discussed. The synthesis of such teardrop-shaped <b>tin</b> <b>phosphide</b> particles, {{is based on}} the reaction of tin acetate in a mixed solution of trioctyl phosphine (TOP) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO). Several different shapes of nanoscale metal phosphide particles, such as nanospheres, nanorods, and nanowires, can be formed by controlling the amount and ratio of TOP/TOPO. It was observed that the Li-ion positioning in the interlayer leads to local structural modification around the central Sn atom and prevents the scattering interaction between the central Sn atom and neighboring Sn atom. This material with high reversible capacity, and low average working potential, can be a good candidate to be used as anode material for high-capacity Li secondary batteries. close 343...|$|E
40|$|The binary metal phosphides (M-P, M= Cu, Fe, Sn, Sb) {{compounds}} are {{of great}} interest as negative electrode materials for high energy density lithium-ion batteries. However, the morphology and structural changes at the nanoscale upon electrochemical (de) lithiation are not clear yet, which require further detailed investigation. In-situ neutron scattering technique was utilized to investigate and compare the morphological changes of copper phosphide and <b>tin</b> <b>phosphide</b> during the initial cycle. By coupling with SEM investigation, the surface activities of the electrodes at different electrochemical state, including the SEI formation, swelling and recovering, cracks appearance and stripping at nanoscale of the material particles are evaluated. With in-situ XRD measurement, the energy storage mechanism was further explained. This work demonstrates useful techniques to analyze the detailed fatigue mechanisms of the active material, and provides new insights of the nanostructural changes of anode materials reacting with lithium via conversion and alloying...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} chemical {{vapour deposition}} (APCVD) of <b>tin</b> <b>phosphide</b> thin films was achieved on glass substrates from the reaction of SnCl 4 or SnBr 4 with R-N PH 3 -N (R = Cyc(hex) or phenyl) Lit 500 - 600 degreesC. These coatings show good uniformity and surface coverage. They are reasonably adherent, passing the scotch tape test. The films were largely opaque in appearance with regions of birefringence. The films were X-ray amorphous. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed surface morphologies consistent with an island growth mechanism. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) binding energy shifts for SnP 1. 00 were 487. 2 eV for Sn 3 d(5 / 2) and 133. 6 eV for P 2 rho(3 / 2). Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) and electron probe studies gave elemental ratios that were in agreement indicating slightly tin rich and stoichiometric films, with negligible chlorine or bromine incorporation (SuP(1. 33) -SnP 0. 40). No Raman scattering was observed. Sheet resistance measurements indicated the films were insulating. Optically the films showed very poor reflectance (approxiinately 2 %) and 5 - 20 % total transmissions from 300 to 800 nm. Contact angle measurements were in the range 70 - 80 degrees, and showed little change after 60 -min irradiation at 254 nm. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|This {{work was}} {{performed}} with the view of elucidating the behavior of indium <b>tin</b> oxide/indium <b>phosphide</b> (ITO/InP) solar cells prepared by RF and ion beam sputtering. It was found that using RF sputter deposition of the ITO always leads to more efficient devices than ion beam sputter deposition. An {{important aspect of the}} former technique is the exposure of the single crystal p-InP substrates to a very low plasma power prior to deposition. Substrates treated in this manner have also been used for ion beam deposition of ITO. In this case the cells behave very similarly to the RF deposited cells, thus suggesting that the lower power plasma exposure (LPPE) is the crucial process step...|$|R
40|$|The {{conditions}} for the in situ planar etching of (100) indium phosphide in the In/PCl 3 system for both hydrogen and nitrogen ambients have been established. Epitaxial layers grown on substrates vapour etched under these conditions show an improved flatness. The electrical properties of silicon and <b>tin</b> doped indium <b>phosphide</b> layers obtained using mixtures of dichlorosilane and stannic chloride in hydrogen are compared with results from sulphur doped material. Both silicon and tin demonstrate a PCl 3 concentration dependence and all three dopants demonstrate 77 K Hall mobilities which imply strong compensation when compared with published theoretical calculations...|$|R
40|$|Complexes (THF) ₀-₂E[P₃Nb(ODipp) ₃]₂ (E = Sn, Pb; Dipp = 2, 6 -iPr₂C₆H₃) were {{prepared}} and characterized as potential precursors to new tetrel phosphides. Treatment of (THF) Sn[P₃Nb(ODipp) ₃]₂ with pyridine-N-oxide effected {{the formation of}} ONb(ODipp) ₂(py) ₂ and a new <b>tin</b> <b>phosphide,</b> [(THF) SnP₆]x, characterized using a multitude of techniques. Additionally, P₃Nb(ODipp) ₂(py) ₂, prepared from [Na(THF) ₃][[P₃Nb(ODipp) ₃] {{in the presence of}} pyridine and salts of coordinating cations, was found to successfully produce AsP₃ upon treatment with AsCl₃ Dimer [P₂Nb(ODipp) ₃]₂ has been obtained via a novel " 2 (3 - 1) " synthetic strategy. The mononuclear diphosphorus complex P₂Nb(ODipp) ₃ proposed to be generated transiently by formal P- abstraction from previously reported [Na(THF) ₃][P₃Nb(ODipp) ₃] undergoes irreversible dimerization to form the [P₂Nb(ODipp) ₃]₂ complex, and is alternatively trapped reversibly by a 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene (CHD) to form in situ C₆H₈P₂Nb(ODipp) ₃ Unprotected dibenzo- 7 [lambda]³A 3 -phosphanorbornadiene derivatives RPA (A= C₁₄H₁₀ or anthracene; R = tBu, dbabh, HMDS, iPr₂N, cis-Me₂ Pip, Cy₂N, Me₂N) were synthesized by treatment of the corresponding phosphorus dichloride RPCl₂ with MgA- 3 THF. Thermolysis of RPA benzene-d₆ solutions leads to anthracene extrusion. Experimental and computational thermodynamic activation parameters suggest this process occurs through the intermediacy of a singlet phosphinidene for the iPr₂N derivative. The [RP] unit could be transferred to CHD, a carbene and an ortho-benzoquinone, with formation of the corresponding anti- 7 -phosphanorbornene, phosphaalkene and phospholane. The anthracene diphosphorus adduct P₂A₂ was synthesized from Me₂NPA, through isolated intermediates CIPA and [P₂A₂Cl][AlCl₄]. P₂A₂ was found to transfer P₂ efficiently to N-₃ CHD, 1, 3 -butadiene and (C₂H₄) Pt(PPh₃) ₂ to form 1, 2 -cyclo-[P₂N₃]-, P₂(CHD) ₂, P₂(BD) ₂ and (P₂) [Pt(PPh₃) ₂]₂. A complete kinetic and computational study of the P₂(CHD) ₂ formation from P₂A₂ suggests P₂ is a productive intermediate in solution. Additionally, a molecular beam mass spectrometry study on the thermolysis of solid P₂A₂ reveals the direct detection of molecular fragments of only P₂ and anthracene thus establishing a link between solution-phase P₂-transfer chemistry and production of gas-phase P₂ by mild thermal activation of a molecular precursor. The HCP precursor Ph₃PC(H) PA was synthesized directly from C 1 PA. The activation of P₄ with [Na][SnPh₃] and sodium naphthalenide led to the synthesis of phosphide compounds [Na(benzo- 15 -crown- 5) ][P(SnPh₃) ₂], P(SnPh₃) ₃, (XL) ₂InP(SnPh₃) ₂, (Ph₃P) AuP(SnPh₃) ₂, P₇(SnPh₃) ₃ and P 7 (SiMe₃) ₃, characterized using a variety of techniques. by Alexandra Velian.
