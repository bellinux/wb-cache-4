5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{estimate of}} the <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> outer space was by the Swiss physicist Charles É. Guillaume in 1896. Using the estimated radiation of the background stars, he concluded that space must be heated to a <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> 5–6K. British physicist Arthur Eddington made a similar calculation to derive a <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> 3.18K in 1926.

40|$|The paper {{reports a}} study <b>of</b> <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> phase {{transitions}} of nine samples of real grades of low-alloyed steels, including one sample of pure iron, using differential thermal analysis. <b>Temperatures</b> <b>of</b> phase transitions were {{measured in the}} low-temperature interval (20 – 1000 °C).

It follows from the results that differences, sometimes considerable ones, still exist between experimental and theoretical data, which implies the necessity for further systematic research in this area...|$|R
