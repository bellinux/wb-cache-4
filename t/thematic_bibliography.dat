40|$|A <b>thematic</b> <b>bibliography</b> has {{the dual}} {{function}} of research summation and discipline boundary-demarcation. When a discipline is still forming, and its patterns are still pliable, a bibliography {{could have a}} stabilizing effect, laying the foundation for future scholarship. The admittance of entries {{from a variety of}} relevant fields into the bibliography establishes them as the scholarly canon, and they become the core around which subsequent research clusters. This function is apparent in particular in this bibliography of Jewish folklore...|$|E

40|$|Focus of {{the project}} are the great {{opportunities}} related to the spreading of knowledge through IT solutions: still inaccessible a few years ago, today the first engine for cultural initiatives. The digital storage of information, more and more diffused in PA environments {{as well as in}} accounting business, has grown till involving even library collections and allowing on line access to periodicals and editorial works. On this basis, the authors describe a large project aiming to the digital reproduction and storing of the whole collection of «Bollettino della Società Geografica Italiana», that means more than 50. 000 text and image files derived from the articles edited between 1873 and 2002, the last year in which production has been only on paper. From this date on, the bulletin is also consultable on the official site www. societageografica. it. The project was conceived by the academic professor Tullio D’Aponte, and then developed by Daniela La Foresta at the Department of Environmental and Territorial Dynamics Analysis of Federico II University of Naples, supported by internal engineers and students. The project was then defined in it’s final details together with Franco Salvatori, President of the Italian Geographic Society. This digital edition of the bulletin allows the building of interactive queries to find the articles of interest and then printing them entirely or in part. It is also possible to realize a <b>thematic</b> <b>bibliography</b> of selected articles and then export or print it separately. The software for indexing and search has been realized in the same University Department under the guide of Tullio D’Aponte and is free from commercial copyright...|$|E

Since summer 2011, EAHR facilitates opportunities for critical engagement with issues of ethnic and cultural representation within the visual arts in Canada. EAHR fosters creation and exchange through {{a wide range of}} activities including public talks, symposiums, curatorial projects, research residencies, workshops and publications. EAHR’s file at Artexte is a reflection of ongoing collective inquiry and contribution to the field of ethnocultural research. The file consists of a range of critical documents encompassing exhibition catalogues, essays, and <b>thematic</b> <b>bibliographies.</b> Additionally, it includes ephemera such as promotional posters, pamphlets, press releases, and event programs, that constitute the material traces of the everyday operations of an active student group. Documents produced between 2011 and 2017 were collected and organized {{in the context of the}} residency “EAHR@Artexte: Celebrating 5 years of student-led research” in Winter 2017. The residency sought not only to commemorate EAHR’s practice but also to share its insights in the field of ethnocultural arts and serve as a template for other student-centered research groups. A spreadsheet lists the documents available digitally through e-artexte and on-site in a physical file at Artexte.

40|$|The Encyclopedia of the Life Course and Human Development {{examines}} {{three key}} life stages from a sociological perspective, exploring how enduring experiences, {{as well as}} transitions and events such as childcare, education, stress, marriage, career, addiction, friendship, parenthood, disease, spirituality, and retirement influence the individual?s life course. The nearly 400 entries in this three-volume set are organized by life stage: Childhood and Adolescence; Adulthood; and Later Life. Included in each is an overview essay that features a detailed discussion of that stage of human development, followed by signed entries that apply sociological as well as economic, biological, psychological, and educational perspectives {{to a range of}} topics. Also covered are sociological theories and their significance to life course study; the impact of social and government policies; and racial, gender, and geographic patterns of many life course phenomena. Entries are heavily illustrated with photos, graphs, charts, and tables.

40|$|While Soviet and Russian cinema {{was rather}} understudied until the {{collapse}} of the USSR, since the early 1990 s there has been a rise in publications and scholarship on the topic, reflecting an increase in the popularity of film and cultural studies in general. However, different periods of Soviet cinema have been covered quite unevenly in scholarship. Largely, {{this has to do with}} the accessibility of films: whereas films of the Soviet avant-garde have been widely available?many of the early Soviet films were shown in film clubs and film societies around the world at the time of their making?from the 1930 s onward the Soviet Union cut its ties with the West, and films of the Stalinist era remained isolated in their own culture. With the Cold War and the subsequent Thaw, that situation changed, and once again a number of Soviet films became available through festivals and limited distribution. However, it was not until glasnost and perestroika that an interest in Soviet cinema sparked and led to television screenings and releases of new or unshelved films. Strangely, English-language scholarship has continued to focus on the ?big? names, those directors whose films were released and distributed abroad, while the works of filmmakers both of auteur cinema (e. g., Kira Muratova) and popular cinema (e. g., Leonid Gaidai and Eldar Riazanov) often remain understudied. Nevertheless, scholars in the Slavic field have engaged more and more with film and visual art, making a huge contribution to the field of Russian film studies. It is often a tightrope walk to classify texts written by leading film scholars with limited access to original sources because of the language barrier, and texts by Slavic scholars with expertise in the culture but a philological background. Yet this ?dilemma? also means that the spectrum of scholarship is wide-ranging and engages with a number of different approaches and perspectives on Russian cinema?from historical to political and ideological, from visual and aesthetic to narrative, from theoretical to <b>thematic.</b> This <b>bibliography</b> includes English-language publications only and follows Library of Congress transliteration (without diacritics) outside the citations...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{title was}} published on an influential Italian newspaper, La Stampa, on November 7, 2013. "Tra i tesori della 2 ̆ 7 Letteratura Grigia 2 ̆ 7 un 2 ̆ 7 Eneide in napoletano del 2 ̆ 7600 ". The article {{is about the}} presentation of the "Fondo De Mauro" on the Italian Network of Popular Culture: this fund originates from a private collection built up in several decades and donated to the Network by Tullio De Mauro and his wife Silvana Ferreri in 2011; it is made up of thousands of books, brochures, pamphlets relating to Italian dialects and minority languages. In the field of healthcare, while browsing on the web, we found the title of a PhD thesis of last year: "Letteratura Grigia nelle meta-analisi delle prove ripartite con scelta casuale degli interventi di sanit?". In the legal environment, the title of a Seminar at the University of Siena emerges from the web: "La "centralit?" della legge e la letteratura grigia. Profili di politica del diritto in Italia tra Otto e Novecento". From these findings, the idea of a survey on the wide variety of grey material available on Italian web portals arises. A first analysis shows that this material is available in different forms and dissemination is carried out through various means such as <b>thematic</b> <b>bibliographies,</b> newspapers articles, various types of documents published in pdf format or simple descriptions on web sites. The following are a few examples excerpted from some home pages belonging to our corpus: ? Collection of grey literature. The Historical Archive of Women candidates for becoming the repository where the memories about these themes will be stored [...] . ? Grey literature [...] . Master copies ? Reprints ? Unreleased copies ? Grey Literature. Archives for the history of Education [...] . ? Grey literature. The high quality brand of parks [...] . ? [...] . International grey literature; national and international legislative data on the topic of drug addiction and related themes; documentary archive [...] . ? Besides literature in German, there is literature in other languages and grey literature as well - in particular catalogues of museums and exhibitions [...] . ? It is about a few thousand of books, brochures and documents of grey literature concerning two topics, Italian dialects and minority languages [...] . Given this scenario, the research aims at verifying whether - and eventually how much - the grey literature available on the web is actually structured, accessible or even managed by systems dealing with its organization and aiming at its retrieval and storing. The utmost goal is to build up a map of non-academic communities and their mechanisms for managing, presenting and disseminating this type of material: a sort of journey among the streams of the web which channel meeting minutes, invites, manifests, fliers, pictures, newspapers articles, journalistic services and audio/video material on various topics. These "grey" products - by conveying basic information about social and popular culture - store, represent and spread knowledge. Significant examples could be identified in the web sites presenting the following matters: history of women 2 ̆ 7 s culture and of their movement in some specific Italian regions; projects dealing with the sustainability of urban environment with respect to childhood and adolescence; parks and other natural protected environments; archaeological documentation such as draft reports, diaries from the site, letters and miscellaneous documentation; nursing and health-related disciplines which produce guidelines, diagnostic and therapeutic courses, informative material for patients and their families. Also the theatrical culture is nourished by "grey products" as video archives, collections of music LPs and CDs, brochures, scripts, autograph manuscripts (i. e [...] letters, correspondences, fliers, musical scores). In substance, a heterogeneous set of material which could reveal especially interesting to both researchers, scientists, professionals and simple fans and lovers of the various subjects if ever made available and usable. Focus Analysis of the documentation and production of taxonomies finalized at the creation of a map of non-academic communities and stakeholders involved in the management of grey material. Material and methods The survey examines the several disciplines, the typology, the institutional nature and the fields to which these grey communities belong, noticing as well the variety of documentation provided, the structure of information and the presentation and access modalities through the following steps: 1) Selection of the web portals as resulted from the query "letteratura grigia" OR "letteratura non convenzionale" OR "documentazione grigia" OR "materiale grigio". 2) Creation of a corpus made up of 28, 000 occurrences. 3) Analysis of the various communities and of the grey material retrieved. 4) Statistical elaboration of the data. Conclusions: reflections on the communities and stakeholders involved in the management of grey literature and on the various ways of presenting the documentation provided by the web sites selected for this survey...|$|R
