5|$|Located on Southwest Washington Street between Third and Fourth avenues in {{downtown}} Hillsboro, {{the station is}} decorated with dark red bricks. Overhead is a steep-pitched roof, with the station's floor in the vestibule built of concrete planks in homage to the cedar-planked roads that formerly existed in the town. Designed by the architectural firm OTAK Inc., the station is {{the largest of the}} MAX stations on the westside line as it extends most of the length of the block between Third and Fourth avenues. Hillsboro Central sits on the same site of the old Oregon Electric Railway station for the Hillsboro area and has a station building that is designed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old railroad station with features similar to those at a Grand Central Station type of facility.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it was not}} {{immediately}} obvious to the men on Bellone, the new arrival was Plampin's Powerful, which had arrived in Indian waters on 13 June 1806. Finding no trace of Willaumez, who had elected {{to remain in the}} Atlantic, Plampin briefly anchored at Madras and subsequently cruised off Ceylon. There, following intelligence sent by Pellew, he captured the 20-gun French privateer Henriette near Trincomalee after an 11-hour chase. From information possibly supplied by prisoners removed from Henriette or possibly from a merchant ship sailing from Colombo, Plampin learned of Perroud's operations and had arranged to meet Rattlesnake off the Little Basses Reef. In the hope of luring the privateer into a confrontation, he disguised his large warship <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> East Indiaman. Perroud rapidly saw through the disguise, and also noticed that while the wind remained strong off the coast, Powerful was further out to sea and appeared becalmed. Realising that his only option was to sail between Powerful and the shore, Perroud turned eastwards, but the wind gradually strengthened for Powerful and by 17:00 the ship of the line was within range of Bellone with her bow chasers.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, Edward Hall {{presented}} the trilogy as a two-part series at the Watermill Theatre in Newbury. Hall followed the Jackson/Seale structure, combining 1 Henry VI and 2 Henry VI into one play {{that all but}} eliminated 1 Henry VI, and following this with an edited version of 3 Henry VI. This production was noted for how it handled {{the violence of the}} play. The set was designed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> abattoir, but rather than attempt to present the violence realistically (as most productions do), Hall went in the other direction, presenting the violence symbolically. Whenever a character was decapitated or killed, a red cabbage was sliced up whilst the actor mimed the death beside it.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fifth}} book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the Ministry of Magic has been waging a smear {{campaign}} against Harry and Dumbledore, disputing their claims that Voldemort has returned. Harry is made <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> attention-seeking liar, and Dumbledore a trouble-maker. A new character is introduced when the Ministry of Magic appoints Dolores Umbridge {{as the latest}} Hogwarts' Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor (and Ministry spy). Because the paranoid Ministry suspects that Dumbledore is building a wizard army to overthrow them, Umbridge refuses to teach students real defensive magic. She gradually gains more power, eventually ousting Dumbledore and seizing control of the school. As a result, Harry's increasingly angry and erratic behaviour nearly estranges him from Ron and Hermione.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, the director's wishes {{were for}} it <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> actual mutated fish-like creature, {{rather than have}} a more fantastical design. In the opening scenes of the film, two {{fishermen}} presumably encounter the creature whilst it is still {{small enough to fit}} in one of their cups; suggestive of its humble, more realistic origins. The monster also exhibits frontal limbs similar to amphibians' legs. This element of its design seems to have been more a choice of functionality on the designers' part as the monster needed to be able to run and perform certain acrobatic movements during the film. For a genre film monster, the creature's size is rather small, only {{about the size of a}} truck. Also unlike in many other monster-themed films, the creature is fully visible from early on in the film, sometimes for large stretches of time and even in broad daylight, which earned the film some critical praise.|$|E
