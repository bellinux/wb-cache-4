25|$|There is some {{indication}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> may be pursuing {{a new approach}} to development, one moving away from military-led development projects and toward a more independent USAID that will include in its new strategy an effort to reduce poor governance.|$|E

25|$|In early December, ad-lib {{comments}} by the White House spokesman were initially ambiguous.

5000|$|Culture of Corruption: Obama and His Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks, and Cronies is a {{book written}} by {{conservative}} author Michelle Malkin. <b>The</b> book claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Barack <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> has had dozens of instances of corruption.

25|$|According to the San Francisco Chronicle, {{the speech}} {{may have played}} some role in the June 2009 Iranian Presidential {{election}} between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his rival Mir Hossein Mousavi, spurring on reformist public opinion. The paper also stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> would probably be loath {{to talk about this}} publicly in fear of sparking an Iranian backlash. About a week later, some unnamed Obama administration officials did make that case to the Washington Post.|$|E
25|$|On 21 April 2014 the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal overtuned the {{above-mentioned}} December 2012 ruling by U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon and ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> must release documents justifying its drone-killings of Americans and foreigners. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal released on 23 June 2014 a Juli 2010 memo by then U.S. Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel David Barron which outlined {{the rationale for}} killing the American Citizen Anwar al-Aulaqi.|$|E
25|$|Following Holder's {{announcement}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>Administration</b> {{would no}} longer defend DOMA Section 3 in court, on March 16, 2011, Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced the Respect for Marriage Act in the Senate again and Nadler introduced it in the House.

2500|$|As of 2010, {{there were}} 678 {{authorized}} district court judgeships.

5000|$|In 2006, Jaffer filed a case {{challenging}} the Bush administration's refusal {{to issue a}} visa to Tariq Ramadan, a well-known Islamic thinker.

A federal appeals court sided with Jaffer and his clients in 2009, finding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> exclusion of Professor Ramadan was unconstitutional. [...] After <b>that</b> ruling, <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> reversed <b>the</b> exclusion of Dr. Ramadan and issued him a visa.|$|R
25|$|Questions {{have been}} {{subsequently}} raised, however, over the continued presence of U.S. nuclear weapons, reportedly {{stationed at the}} air base during the Cold War {{as part of the}} NATO nuclear sharing programme, after recent parliamentary debates in Belgium and Germany called for the removal of weapons stationed there under the same programme. Bilkent University Professor Mustafa Kibaroğlu speculates <b>that</b> if <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> presses for <b>the</b> withdrawal of these weapons, which Turkey wishes to maintain, then Turkey-U.S. relations may be strained.|$|R
25|$|On September 4, Attorney General Eric Holder, as {{required}} by law, notified Speaker of the House John Boehner <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> had determined {{that it should not}} enforce the federal statutes that define spouse in a way that excludes same-sex spouses. He cited Windsor and the decision in Cooper-Harris the previous week as well as BLAG's withdrawal from litigation challenging the statutes in question. Advocates for same-sex spouses of veterans welcomed the announcement, but noted that the question of the rights of such spouses remained uncertain if they live in states that do not recognize their marriage.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{tension between}} India and Pakistan who both possess nuclear weapons. This {{conflict}} has been ongoing since August 1947 after the Partition of India. Recent developments {{in this conflict}} involve the Kashmir region with Pakistan controlling the northwest portion, India controlling the central and southern portion and the People's Republic of China controlling the northeastern portion of Kashmir. Criticism had been leveled at the Obama administration for its apparent lack of an early response to U.S. foreign policy with India. The former director for South Asia in the National Security Council in the Bush administration, Xenia Dormandy claims that India is America's indispensable ally {{in the region and}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> should take steps to improve relations with India.|$|E
25|$|The US force {{level will}} drop to between 10,000 and 20,000 troops {{according}} to the Long War Journal. They will consist of Special Forces, counterterrorism forces, and military training personnel. They will be deployed to {{a small number of}} bases around the country. US/ISAF troops will continue their training of Afghan National Security Forces soldiers. Counterterrorism forces will concentrate mostly on high-value targets. U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated on 12 November 2012 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>Administration</b> will cease combat operations by the end of 2014, but it is still refining its timeline for withdrawing the remaining 68,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The administration was also debating how many trainers, Special Operations forces and military assets it will keep in the country after that to support Afghanistan’s army and police.|$|E
5000|$|Shlaes {{responded to}} Krugman in the Wall Street Journal <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bureau of Labor Statistics series {{she had used}} [...] "intentionally did not include {{temporary}} jobs in emergency programs - because to count a short-term, make-work project as a real job was to mask the anxiety of one who really didn't have regular work with long-term prospects".

[...] The EPA is one of <b>the</b> federal agencies <b>that</b> advised <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> on <b>the</b> proposed pipeline, [...] "a project that would carry millions of barrels of bitumen a week from Alberta's carbon-intensive oilsands to the U.S. Gulf Coast".|$|R
2500|$|On November 26, 2009, in an {{interview}} with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, President Hamid Karzai said there is an [...] "urgent need" [...] for negotiations with the Taliban, and made it clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> had opposed such talks.

2500|$|After Vice President Joe Biden said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> {{would not}} release Jonathan Pollard [...] "over my dead body", Cain {{publicly}} disagreed with Biden's stance {{and said that}} as a supporter of Israel, he personally sympathizes with Pollard.

5000|$|Turse {{has carried}} out {{extensive}} {{investigations of the}} U.S. military's most elite troops. Turse uncovered that in 2014, elite U.S. troops were dispatched to 70% of the countries on the planet and were carrying out missions in 80 to 90 nations each day. [...] In a 2015 article for The Nation, Turse revealed <b>that</b> under <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration,</b> U.S. special operations forces deployed to 147 countries that year.

40|$|Much of the {{discussion}} about the hunt for and killing of Osama bin Laden {{has focused on the}} remarkable abilities of the U. S. Special Operations Forces who carried out the raid.

40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview both of <b>the</b> considerable makeover <b>that</b> relations between <b>the</b> United States and Myanmar have undergone since Naypyidaw ushered in a programme of wide-ranging reforms, and of the main policy areas in relation to which Washington remains keen to induce further change. The article also aims to explain why, notwithstanding the significant improvement in bilateral relations and <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> administration’s interest in also pursuing military engagement, progress in this field has remained rather limited. Focusing {{on the politics of}} US policymaking on Burma, <b>the</b> article argues <b>that</b> while <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> was able to take the initiative on recalibrating US Burma policy, congressional resistance in particular, amid wider concerns shared by non-governmental organisations, has so far constrained the administration vis-à-vis US–Myanmar military-to-military relations...|$|R
