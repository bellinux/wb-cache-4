The aim of this thesis is to identify opportunities for controled leisure physical activities in children with mental, visual and DEF disability aged 8 - 15 years in Central and South Bohemia Region. These methods were used: content analysis, questioning method, comparative method and statistical data analysis. It was found {{that there are more}} children with disability in the Central Bohemia Region than in South Bohemia Region. There are better conditions for children with visual disability in Central Bohemia Region, which would be expected, given the larger population and better access to Prague. Surprisingly, in schools are better conditions in South Bohemia Region. It can be concluded that the situation for children with mentioned disability is not optimal.

40|$|SCALE-UP (Student-Centered Activities for Large Enrollment Undergraduate Programs) is a {{specialized}} active learning format that relies largely upon social interaction among students, instructor, and learning assistants. The instructor and learning assistants serve as facilitators of guided inquiry by asking students leading questions {{as they work}} through class assignments. On-going, real time formative assessments ensure that the instructor is constantly aware of which students are mastering the material and which are struggling. The SCALE-UP format is currently used at our institution in the General Engineering program (all sections {{of the first year}} courses), Math Sciences (all sections of first year calculus, and one section of second year calculus), Civil Engineering (one section of engineering statics), Mechanical Engineering (all sections of engineering statics and dynamics), as well as in courses in Horticulture, Nursing, English, and Computer Science. This special session focuses on strategies for successful implementation of this pedagogical innovation.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. The study {{investigated}} {{the attitudes of the}} instructors of English currently working at Karadeniz Technical University School of Foreign Languages Department of Basic English towards project work as an alternative assessment and as an instructional approach and their knowledge about project work. In this study administrators’ views on implementation of project work in the program is also investigated. Data were collected through interviews and questionnaires. First the instructors were given a questionnaire. Second interviews conducted both with administrators and volunteer instructors. The results of data analysis revealed that both instructors and administrators working for Karadeniz Technical University School of Foreign Languages Department of Basic English have positive attitudes towards project work as an alternative assessment and as an instructional tool. Most of the instructors found using project assessments more satisfying and acceptable than using traditional pencil-paper tests such as multiple-choice or short answer tests. However, the analysis interviews revealed that some of the instructors have difficulties in implementing projects in their classroom. The results of the interviews conducted with administrators also revealed {{that there is a need}} for in-service <b>training</b> <b>for</b> <b>instructors</b> in respect to use of projects. Moreover, the results of this study suggest that participants have some concerns about current implementation of project work at KTU and a variety of suggestions for possible improvements. This study suggests that if the instructors are given enough training about use of projects, the benefits of project work may be maximized in the curriculum. Gökçen, Ramazan AlparslanM. S...|$|E

40|$|University {{instructors}} {{can improve}} how they promote critical {{thinking in the}} classroom by fostering reflective writing habits with students. Midwest University requires all undergraduate students to complete 2 capstone courses, which are framed around a critical thinking curriculum. The skills of analyzing and reflecting on experiences are important components of critical thinking. Despite this acknowledged importance of critical thinking, there is currently no structured <b>training</b> <b>for</b> <b>instructors</b> of the capstone course on how to develop critical thinking abilities among adult students. The purpose of this case {{study was to examine}} the perceptions of the instructors of the capstone courses and their approaches to promoting critical thinking. Literature on critical thinking and reflective writing provided the framework for this study. Participants included 5 instructors with experience teaching one of the capstone courses. Data collection included semi-structured interviews, classroom observations, and reflective journals. Analysis was inductive using open coding and constant comparison to identify emergent themes. Findings indicated that a common practice to promote critical thinking was through probing questions and deep discussions, that a challenge to promoting a critical thinking curriculum was student engagement, and that more importance should be placed on assessing critical thinking in the grading rubrics. Results prompted the creation of a professional development workshop to offer training to instructors that included the experience of progressing through reflective activities and deep discussion to better guide their students through the same process in an effort to strengthen critical thinking development. University instructors may glean best practices from this study to guide students in developing the capacity to think from a more critical and global perspective...|$|E
40|$|Pick {{up almost}} any {{shipping}} related newspaper or journal published currently {{and there will}} inevitably be included a tragic tale of a shipping casualty. The efforts to reduce the casualty statistics are immeasurable as are the theories and approaches to the management of safety in our industry. There has already been much debate about the purpose, function and effectiveness of the IMO’s STCW code and convention but whatever our individual opinions, it is the code by which the industry must abide. In its foreword it mentions “minimum global standards of knowledge, understanding, experience and professional competence”. The current status of the <b>Training</b> <b>for</b> <b>Instructors</b> course is that as mentioned as a reference in Section A-I/ 6 of the STCW Code, it “may be of assistance in preparation of courses”. The existing requirements of trainers and educators of the code might be loosely interpreted as having knowledge of a subject and have received guidance on how to deliver training. Is this requirement sufficient? In the trade press, alongside the tales of woe relating to avoidable accidents, there are almost as many articles associated with apparently innovative approaches to training and management, directed not only at reducing these accidents but also endeavouring to improve performance. So can we ask the question, to which standards are our seafarers trained? Is it a standard which merely complies with the regulatory standard, inducing a ‘culture of compliance’? Or is it a standard well over and above mere regulatory requirements, where tasks are completed efficiently and cost-effectively, as well as safely, in order to present a commercially competitive organisation. This paper discusses, argues and counter-argues the contention and concludes with the proposal that at very least, the debate should be re-opened. ...|$|E
40|$|Distance {{education}} {{has the potential}} to offer a meaningful alternative for students with disabilities. Colleges and universities have opportunities to provide quality online courses to students with disabilities; yet data show these students may often choose to discontinue higher education pursuits. Little is currently known about how students with disabilities experience the distance learning environment or how institutions of higher education. This phenomenological study focuses {{on the quality of the}} learning experiences and learner satisfaction of students with disabilities in distance education courses. The purpose of this study is to investigate 1) how online learning is experienced by students with disabilities, 2) what factors facilitate or inhibit their online learning, and 3) how what instructors do to facilitate online learning is perceived by students with various disabilities. This study examines how students with various disabilities assess the quality of distance education coursework in terms of three constructs: course interaction, structure, and support. Data was gathered via interviews with consenting participants who had affirmatively responded to a study participation solicitation email and completed a brief survey. Sadly, discussions of topics related to students with disabilities experiences are still rare in the distance education literature. These interview data suggest that, despite having many tasks to which they must attend, more <b>training</b> <b>for</b> <b>instructors</b> is needed on how to work with students with disabilities. The Offices of Students with Disabilities Services and instructors should develop a way to work together, rather than separately, in a proactive rather than reactive fashion, to better serve the needs of students with disabilities. Further research in this area may allow students with disabilities with online courses in higher education to become more vocal about their needs from their individual perspectives and in their own words, and pave the way for improving the quality of the online learning environment for them...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the current training and practices implemented at the Midwest Police Academy to prepare recruits to police in racially and ethnically diverse communities. In this study, I adopted a critical race theory lens, which considered White privilege, dominant White male ideology, and color-blind racial ideology, when examining {{the training and}} practices at the academy. This study examined what the training looks like by providing {{detailed description of the}} training atmosphere as well as classroom instruction. The recruits??? racial attitudes were examined {{at the beginning and end}} of the training to explore potential changes. The instructors??? and administrators??? racial attitudes were also examined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Midwest Police Academy???s ability to prepare recruits to police in racially and ethnically diverse communities by: (a) examining what the training at the Midwest Police Academy looks like in terms of the training atmosphere, curriculum, and classroom interaction; (b) investigating the racial beliefs and attitudes of recruits entering the academy and see if there are any changes at the end of training; (c) and investigating the racial beliefs and attitudes of instructors and administrators. This was a summative evaluation with the ultimate goal of this study being to search for ways to improve training and practices at the academy in terms of better preparing recruits to police in a racially and ethnically diverse society. 	In this study, I adopted a mixed methods approach, collecting data via interviews with instructors and recruits, classroom observations, and written documentation. Participants also completed the Color Blind Racial Attitudes Scale (CoBRAS) (Neville, Lilly, Lee, Duran, & Brown, 2000) to measure racial attitudes. Findings of the study indicated that current training and practices show indications of White privilege, White male ideology, and color-blind racial ideology. There were no significant changes in racial attitudes and beliefs of recruits. Recommendations included: (a) make racial and ethnic diversity training part of the mission statement and vision of MPA; (b) provide racial and ethnic diversity <b>training</b> <b>for</b> <b>instructors</b> and administrators; (c) integrate racial and ethnic diversity training throughout the curriculum, including within the scenario-based training; (d) find ways to create more class participation for racial and ethnic diversity related topics; (e) implement a course on the historical context of policing which includes police-minority relations; (f) include critical race theory and color-blind racial ideology in the curriculum which should include counter-storytelling; (g) recruit more racial and ethnic minority instructors and role players; and (h) involve the community in the training...|$|E
