30|$|In this Section we {{extract from}} the above goals <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> of <b>the</b> envisioned home {{management}} system, focusing on six major areas: <b>the</b> general architectural <b>requirements,</b> <b>the</b> coordination <b>requirements,</b> <b>the</b> configuration <b>requirements,</b> <b>the</b> GUI <b>requirements,</b> <b>the</b> main functional <b>requirements,</b> and <b>the</b> gamification <b>requirements.</b> Later in this paper (Section Implementation), we will discuss whether and to which extent they can be met with the available technologies.|$|R
40|$|Updating <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> {{specification}} when software systems evolve is {{a manual}} task that is expensive and time consuming. Therefore, maintainers usually apply {{the changes to}} the code directly and leave <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> unchanged. This results in <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> rapidly becoming obsolete and useless. In this paper, we propose an approach that supports the maintainer in keeping <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> specification consistent with the implementation, by identifying <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> that are impacted whenever the code is changed. Our approach works as follows. First, we analyze {{the changes that have}} been applied to the source code and detect if they are likely to impact <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> or not. Second, we trace the requirements-impacting changes back to <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> specification to identify the parts that might need to be modified. The output of the tracing is a list of requirements that are sorted according to their likelihood of being impacted. Automatically identifying the parts of <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> specification that are likely to need maintenance reduces the effort needed for keeping <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> up-to-date and thus makes the task of the maintainer easier. When applying our approach in three cases studies, 70 % to 100 % of <b>the</b> impacted <b>requirements</b> were identified within a list that includes less than 20 % {{of the total number of}} <b>requirements</b> in <b>the</b> specification...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{success of}} any {{projects}} {{can be affected}} by requirements changes. We define <b>requirements</b> elicitation as <b>the</b> activity of adding, deleting, and modifying requirements. We here refer to <b>the</b> completion of <b>requirements</b> elicitation of a software component as <b>requirements</b> maturation. <b>The</b> <b>requirements</b> of <b>the</b> component will never be changed after 100 % maturation. We introduce <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> maturation efficiency (RME) in order to estimate <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> maturation period for the component. The RME of <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> represents how quickly <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> of a component reach 100 % maturation. The goal {{of this paper is}} to define a method of estimating the RME of each component. Since requirements analysts (RAs) elicit requirements by accessing requirement sources and stability is one of <b>the</b> characteristics of <b>requirements,</b> we can assume that the RME of a component must be derived from the accessibility of <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> source and <b>the</b> stability of <b>the</b> <b>requirements.</b> We model accessibility as the number of information flows from the source of <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> to <b>the</b> RA and model stability with <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> maturation index (RMI). The results from multiple regression analysis for two cases indicate that RME can be derived by these two factors with a significant level of 5 %. We also discuss a method by which to estimate <b>the</b> period for <b>requirements</b> maturation. Keywords-requirements accessibility; requirements stability; requirements maturation I...|$|R

40|$|D. Ing. (Engineering Management) <b>The</b> <b>requirements</b> {{discipline}} {{is at the}} heart of systems engineering, software engineering and business analysis. When a solution needs to be developed, built or bought that will be useful to the users and that will achieve the intended business goals, the problem needs to be understood before a possible solution can be developed. This process of understanding the problem that needs to be solved and what the solution should achieve is referred to as <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> process. <b>Requirements</b> are <b>the</b> input to the solution development process. If <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> are incorrect, <b>the</b> developed solution will not be useful. The purpose of this study was to discover the social behaviour of practitioners that causes the communication breakdowns during <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> engineering process. <b>Requirements</b> emerge from <b>the</b> social interaction and communication between <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> practitioner and <b>the</b> various stakeholders. The main problems with <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> engineering process are communication and coordination breakdowns, as well as the lack of domain knowledge or understanding of the problem. These challenges are all related to the social interaction during <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> engineering process that impacts <b>the</b> quality of <b>requirements.</b> Researchers have made significant progress in the development of methodologies. Tools and techniques are available for improving <b>the</b> quality of <b>requirements.</b> However, in practice, requirements are still produced with errors which then leads to unsuccessful solutions to problems. <b>The</b> <b>requirements</b> engineering process is executed within a social context. These social elements should be taken into consideration to improve quality. Based on the results collected from real-world practice as well as people’s behaviour in the real world, a complete understanding of the influence on <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> process was derived. This understanding was used to identify the social elements required during <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> engineering process. A socio-technical view is provided of the social and the technical activities that should be facilitated by <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> engineering process. This framework integrates the required communicative activities with <b>the</b> traditional <b>requirements</b> activity. This socio-technical framework for <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> engineering process was developed based on a survey. The aim of this framework is to overcome the social behaviour that causes communication breakdowns and impacts on the quality of <b>the</b> <b>requirements.</b> <b>The</b> research contributes to <b>the</b> existing <b>requirements</b> knowledge base. <b>The</b> socio-technical framework developed for <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> process concerns <b>the</b> communication breakdowns continuously highlighted as a contributing factor to poor <b>requirements,</b> by providing <b>the</b> social activities required during <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> process as guidance. Secondly, the knowledge acquired provides adequate data on requirements practice for future research. Specific focus areas for practitioners and managers on how to improve <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> engineering process without the adoption of any new tools or methodologies are also included in the results. Additionally, practitioners’ behaviour was determined. By determining these interaction and relationship patterns, communication can be improved and made more effective...|$|R
