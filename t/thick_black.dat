5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow (Aimophila ruficeps) {{is a small}} American sparrow. This {{passerine}} {{is primarily}} found across the Southwestern United States {{and much of the}} interior of Mexico, south to the transverse mountain range, and to the Pacific coast to the southwest of the transverse range. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often being isolated from each other. Twelve subspecies are generally recognized, though up to eighteen have been suggested. This bird has a brown back with darker streaks and gray underparts. The crown is rufous, and the face and supercilium are gray with a brown or rufous streak extending from each eye and a <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> malar streak.|$|E
5|$|According to Noon, talk had {{circulated}} about adding extra {{characters that}} {{were not in the}} film. As the Sheng Long hoax and Akuma's debut in Super Street Fighter II Turbo were fairly recent at the time, the designers asked for Capcom's permission to add both characters into the game. Capcom approved the addition of Akuma, but denied the inclusion of Sheng Long. However, Capcom later unexpectedly approved the addition of Sheng Long. Noon designed Sheng Long's appearance for the title, giving him black gi pants and a long, green, padded/quilted, sleeveless Gi style top which was tied off with a black beltmandarin style, long white braided hair, Fu Manchu moustache, a <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> ribbon over his eyes due to being blinded by Akuma and one hand taking the form of a dragon's claw, described {{as a result of his}} power being so advanced, that he began to physically manifest dragon like attributes. Capcom approved the design, and Luis Mangubat an artist from the development team posed as Sheng Long. However, the character was left unfinished because of time constraints.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 8:45am. While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly {{up the side of}} the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.|$|E

50|$|Like other Fenders of the time, the Fender VI had a 7.25-inch {{fingerboard}} radius. The Fender VI, {{along with}} the Jaguar, the Jazzmaster and the Electric XII, was given a bound fretboard with rectangular block inlays in 1967, followed by a <b>thicker</b> <b>black</b> CBS-style headstock decal and polyester finishes instead of nitrocellulose lacquer in 1968.|$|R
25|$|Muncie {{was one of}} {{the first}} players to wear glasses or goggles while playing. He began wearing glasses at Arizona Western, when he wore them at {{practice}} one day and realized they improved his nearsightedness. Muncie wore <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> frames throughout his career, switching to sports goggles late in his career. While with the Saints, he was featured in a full-page ad by glassmaker PPG for shatter-resistant glasses.

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that among the eight differently colored ground traps tested in the greenhouse, black colored traps were the most effective compared with the performances of brown, yellow, red, grey, blue, white, and green traps. In the present study, efficiency of ground traps with different shades of <b>black</b> (<b>black</b> <b>thick,</b> pure <b>black,</b> mix black and black medium) were evaluated in the greenhouse for the capture of Hylotrupes bajulus. <b>Black</b> <b>thick</b> colored traps caught significantly higher H. bajulus than traps with other shades of <b>black.</b> Therefore, <b>black</b> <b>thick</b> colored ground traps are recommended to use for monitoring and mass trapping H. bajulus in museums and human dwellings...|$|R
25|$|In the oil sands, this <b>thick,</b> <b>black</b> gunk {{is mixed}} with sand and many {{chemical}} impurities such as sulfur; these must {{be separated from the}} bitumen for the oil to be useful. This can be done by surface mining and processing and by underground in situ techniques.|$|E

25|$|The {{formation}} {{is named after}} John W. Barnett, who settled in San Saba County during the late 19th century, where he named a local stream the Barnett Stream. In the early 20th century during a geological mapping expedition, scientists noted a <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> organic-rich shale in an outcrop close to the stream. The shale was consequently named the Barnett Shale.|$|E

50|$|The thin, bottommost layer lies {{below the}} chemocline and {{contains}} fewer organisms than the slightly <b>thicker</b> <b>black</b> layer. The gray color {{is due to}} the presence of pyrite. Here, the empty shells of diatoms can be found. Microbial species here are dominated by methylotrophic methanogens which generate the methane observed in the salt marsh. This layer is not active year round; the organisms are largely dormant in the winter.|$|R
25|$|Then a torpedo struck Attack {{amidships}} {{and blew}} her into two pieces, {{both of which}} sank with five to seven minutes. The explosion ruptured Attacks bunkers, spilling tons of <b>thick,</b> <b>black</b> bunker fuel oil into the sea as she sank.

25|$|From 22 September 1944 {{to the end}} of the war, {{there was}} gas {{available}} only two hours per day. Electricity stopped on 9 October. The German occupiers built a <b>thick,</b> <b>black</b> wall through the Haarlemmerhout (in the south of the city), as well as at the Jan Gijzenvaart in the evacuated area. The wall was called Mauer-muur and was meant to help defend the city.|$|E
25|$|On 6 October 2013, {{at least}} 57 {{were killed and}} 393 injured across the country when anti-coup protesters and {{security}} forces clashed amid celebrations of the 40th anniversary of {{the start of the}} 1973 Mideast war with Israel. Pitched battles were fought for hours in some Cairo neighborhoods, where 48 of the 57 fatalities occurred.

25|$|After {{finishing}} his work, Harding departed by taxi {{for a local}} hotel, l'Eau Berge in downtown Lac-Mégantic, for the night. En route, the engineer told the taxi driver that he felt unsafe leaving a locomotive running while it was spitting oil and <b>thick,</b> <b>black</b> smoke. He {{said he wanted to}} call the US office of MMA (in Hermon, Maine) as {{they would be able to}} give him other directives. Taxi driver André Turcotte described the engineer as covered in droplets of oil, which also covered the taxi's windscreen.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species are}} ‘half-barks’ or ‘blackbutts’ {{in which the}} dead bark is {{retained}} in {{the lower half of}} the trunks or stems — for example, E. brachycalyx, E. ochrophloia, and E. occidentalis — or only in a <b>thick,</b> <b>black</b> accumulation at the base, as in E. clelandii. In some species in this category, for example E. youngiana and E. viminalis, the rough basal bark is very ribbony at the top, where it gives way to the smooth upper stems. The smooth upper bark of the half-barks and that of the completely smooth-barked trees and mallees can produce remarkable colour and interest, for example E. deglupta.|$|E

25|$|Eruptions at Krakatoa {{started again}} around 16 June with loud explosions and a <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> cloud {{covering}} the islands for five days. On 24 June, a prevailing east wind cleared the cloud, and two ash columns {{could be seen}} issuing from Krakatoa. The seat of the eruption {{is believed to have}} been a new vent or vents that formed between Perboewatan and Danan. The violence of the ongoing eruptions caused tides in the vicinity to be unusually high, and ships at anchor had to be moored with chains. Earthquakes were felt at Anyer, Banten, and ships began to report large pumice masses to the west in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 8:45am. While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold.

25|$|On {{reaching}} the Indian Ocean, Kormoran was immediately diverted to refuel the whaling ship Adjutant and supply ship Alstertor; refuelling {{was carried out}} between 13 and 17 May. Although originally confined to waters northeast of latitude 20°S and longitude 80°E, the raider's area of operations expanded on 1 June to encompass the entire ocean. The ship's disguise was altered again on 5 June, with Kormoran taking {{the identity of the}} Japanese merchant ship Kinka Maru, as the owners of Sakito Maru rarely operated in the western Indian. After patrolling around the Maldives without success, Kormoran sailed towards the Bay of Bengal with plans to lay mines in the approaches to Madras and Calcutta. Although a target was spotted en route on 15 June, the raider's smoke generator malfunctioned and started to produce <b>thick,</b> <b>black</b> smoke, which scared off the merchantman. On 24 June, while approaching Madras, the raider was spotted and shadowed by what the Germans assumed was a British auxiliary cruiser. The suspicious ship later resumed her original course without incident, but Detmers decided to postpone the mine-laying operation and leave the area, as Allied forces would become suspicious when the 'Japanese' ship failed to reach port.|$|E
60|$|But {{there is}} no need to ask any questions. There was the smoke coming up, <b>thicker</b> and <b>blacker,</b> from the edges of the hatch.|$|R

50|$|Millidge's art is {{primarily}} photo-referenced and extremely realistic. It is also entirely {{in black and}} white, {{with the exception of}} the painted covers. For the first half of the run, the majority of the art was done in basic inks, and the progression can be seen of Millidge's art from simple linework in issue one to the more complex crosshatching and computer-aided shading in later issues. From issue 13 onwards, Millidge's art changed completely to resemble an entirely painted look, with <b>thicker</b> <b>black</b> outlines around characters and more subtle shading.|$|R
