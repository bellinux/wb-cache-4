For such a common species, relatively {{little is known}} about its reproduction: It appears to be a hermaphrodite and oogenesis has been reported as occurring in a very narrow <b>timeband</b> within a single population although exceptions have been observed.|$|E
40|$|Complex {{real-time}} systems must integrate {{physical processes}} with digital control, human operation and organisational structures. New scientific foundations {{are required for}} specifying, designing and implementing these systems. One key challenge is {{to cope with the}} wide range of time scales and dynamics inherent in such systems. To exploit the unique properties of time, with the aim of producing more dependable computer-based systems, a <b>timeband</b> framework has been developed. In this paper we review this framework and report on modifications, extensions and applications that have been undertaken in funded research that completed in 2011. ...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{studies of}} over 100 impact sites on {{aluminium}} foils and mesh supports of the <b>Timeband</b> Capture Cell Experiment (TiCCE) on the European Retrievable Carrier (EuReCa) spacecraft {{were conducted with}} scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray spectrum analyser. Chemical elements of residues {{in and around the}} perforations and craters were examined to identify the origin of impactors. 73 % of the impacts were classified; the minimum of 15 % was due to natural particle impacts and the rest indicated high silicon presence. Possible origins of these silicon profiles were discussed. For micrometeoroid craters, the depths to diameter ratios were compared with those of meteoroid and orbital debris impacts on the Solar Maximum Mission satellite...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of {{hypervelocity}} impact fluxes (in both {{thick and}} thin targets) detected by the University of Kent at Canterbury's <b>Timeband</b> Capture Cell Experiment (TiCCE) (flown on ESA's Eureca spacecraft) are presented. The foil perforations are used to derive the ballistic limit values, or the maximum thickness of Al perforated, for the impacting particles. This data is then combined with the thick target data to derive a unified ballistic limit flux. A significant enhancement in the observed large particle flux compared with LDEF is found, possibly due to the pointing history of Eureca compared to the Earth's orbital direction. Comparisons are also made to predictions from ESABASE modelling. Preliminary results of a study of perforation morphology are also presented, providing insight into particle shape, density and directionality...|$|E
40|$|Visual evoked {{potentials}} (VEPs) {{were recorded}} from the vertex to 5 intensities of light flashes. Measures were taken of peak-to-trough, prestimulus baseline-to-peak, and <b>timeband</b> amplitude for P 1, N 1, and P 2 waveforms. Augmenting/reducing {{was defined by}} traditional (amplitude/intensity slope, monotonicity) and non-traditional (strength of the nervous system, combined amplitude response) criteria. In support of Connolly and Gruzelier [(1982) Psychophysiology, 19 : 599 - 608], analyses showed that data collected by traditional methods contravened assumptions underlying VEP augmenting/reducing methodology. Specifically, 20 % of total peaks occurred outside designated timebands, amplitude/intensity slopes explained only 30 - 46 % variance, and levels of agreement between different definitions were low. Researchers ought to ensure that VEPs are admissible before using them or consider employing non-traditional criteria to avoid rejecting large numbers of inadmissible data...|$|E
40|$|On {{retrieval}} from Low Earth Orbit (LEG), {{the solar}} arrays from the European Retrievable Carrier(EuReCa) and one solar array {{wing of the}} Hubble Space Telescope (HST) were inspected for micrometeoroid and space debris impact damage. 703 and 814 impact sites respectively were analysed in detail. Interpretation of particle parameters from this large data set can yield a useful measurement of the micrometeoroid and debris flux in LEG. Due to similar orbital parameters, this then provides a flux measurement complimentary to those measured by the <b>Timeband</b> Capture Cell Experiment (TiCCE) of the EuReCa spacecraft and detectors and exposed surfaces on the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF). To allow comparison of data from the space retrieved solar cells to previous data, solar cell material, glass and aluminium targets were impacted for inter-calibration using the University of Kent's Light Gas Gun (LGG). An average of 20 impact sites on each target material per shot were measured. It was decided to consider only non-perforations of the 150 micron thick CMX cover glass, common to both EuReCa and HST solar cells. Trends in crater morphology of the laboratory impacts are discussed and compared to those from space impacts. The effects of impact angle and crater scaling with particle size are investigated and a conversion from appropriate solar cell crater parameters to the ballistic limit in aluminium is presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{densities of}} interplanetary micrometeoroids have been {{inferred}} by various techniques in the past; a valuable (albeit indirect) technique {{has been the}} study of the deceleration profile of radar meteor trails, for example. Impacts on the thin foils of the Micro-Abrasion Package on NASA's LDEF satellite and the <b>Timeband</b> Capture Cell Experiment on ESA's Eureca satellite now provide direct in situ measurement of the cross-sections diameters of impacting micrometeoroids and also of space debris particles. Combining these data with impact data from thick-target impact craters, where the damage is mass-dependent, and where such targets have experienced a statistically identical flux, leads to a measure of the impactor density which is only weakly affected by the assumed impact velocity. Comparing the space result with those from simulations shows that the density distribution of interplanetary particles in space has a more significant low density component than the distributions obtained by most other recent methods and that the mean density is in the range 2. 0 to 2. 4 g cm(- 3) for masses of 10 (- 15) to 10 (- 9) kg. The characteristic density - namely, the single value which would characterize the impact behavior of the distribution-is 1. 58 cm(- 3). Perforation profiles reveal that a large fraction of the largest particles impacting the satellites are nonspherical but that typical aspect ratios are mostly in the range 1. 0 - 1. 5. Flux distributions of the meteoroid population incident on the Earth at satellite altitudes are derived in terms of mass and mean diameter. (C) 1998 Academic Press...|$|E
40|$|The Small Particles Intact Capture Experiment (SPICE) {{will develop}} {{technologies}} and engineering techniques necessary to capture nearly intact, uncontaminated cosmic and interplanetary dust particles (IDP's). Successful capture of such particles {{will benefit the}} exobiology and planetary science communities by providing particulate samples that may have survived unaltered since {{the formation of the}} solar system. Characterization of these particles may contribute fundamental data to our knowledge of how these particles could have formed into our planet Earth and, perhaps, contributed to the beginnings of life. The term 'uncontaminated' means that captured cosmic and IDP particles are free of organic contamination from the capture process and the term 'nearly intact capture' means that their chemical and elemental components are not materially altered during capture. The key to capturing cosmic and IDP particles that are organic-contamination free and nearly intact is the capture medium. Initial screening of capture media included organic foams, multiple thin foil layers, and aerogel (a silica gel); but, with the exception of aerogel, the requirements of no contamination or nearly intact capture were not met. To ensure no contamination of particles in the capture process, high-purity aerogel was chosen. High-purity aerogel results in high clarity (visual clearness), a useful quality in detection and recovery of embedded captured particles from the aerogel. P. Tsou at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) originally described the use of aerogel for this purpose and reported laboratory test results. He has flown aerogel as a 'GAS-can Lid' payload on STS- 47 and is evaluating the results. The <b>Timeband</b> Capture Cell Experiment (TICCE), a Eureca 1 experiment, is also flying aerogel and is scheduled for recovery in late April...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{benefit of}} {{accurately}} quantifying and characterizing the space environmental effects on materials is longer instrument and spacecraft life. Knowledge {{of the limits}} of materials allows the designer to optimize the spacecraft design so that the required life is achieved. Materials such as radiator coatings that have excellent durability result in the design of smaller radiators than a radiator coated with a lower durability coating. This may reduce the weight of the spacecraft due to a more optimum design. Another benefit of characterizing materials is the quantification of outgassing properties. Spacecraft which have ultraviolet or visible sensor payloads are susceptible to contamination by outgassed volatile materials. Materials with known outgassing characteristics can be restricted in these spacecraft. Finally, good data on material characteristics improves the ability of analytical models to predict material performance. A flight experiment was conducted on the European Space Agency's European Retrievable Carrier (EuReCa) as part of the <b>Timeband</b> Capture Cell Experiment (TICCE). Our main objective was to gather additional data on the dust and debris environments, with the focus on understanding growth as a function of size (mass) for hypervelocity particles 1 E- 06 cm and larger. In addition to enumerating particle impacts, hypervelocity particles were to be captured and returned intact. Measurements were performed post-flight to determine the flux density, diameters, and subsequent effects on various optical, thermal control and structural materials. In addition to these principal measurements, the experiment also provided a structure and sample holders for the exposure of passive material samples to the space environment, e. g., the effects of thermal cycling, atomic oxygen, etc. Preliminary results are presented, including the techniques used for intact capture of particles...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{and plans}} for orbital capture of cosmic dust and interplanetary dust {{particles}} (IDP's) looked very bright {{with the advent of}} space station Freedom (SSF) and formal selection of Cosmic Dust Collection Facility (CDCF) as an attached payload in 1990. Unfortunately it has been downhill since its selection, culminating in CDCF being dropped as attached payload in the SSF redesign process this year. This action was without any input from the science or cosmic dust communities. The Exobiology Intact Capture Experiment (Exo-ICE) as an experiment on CDCF was also lost. Without CDCF, no facility-class instrument for cosmic dust studies is available or planned. When CDCF (and Exo-ICE) was selected as a SSF attached payload, an exercise called the small particle intact capture experiment (SPICE) was started for Exo-ICE to develop an understanding and early testing of the necessary expertise and technology for intact capture of cosmic dust and IDP's. This SPICE activity looks to fly small, meter square or less, collection area experiments on early orbital platforms of opportunity such as EURECA, MIR, WESTAR, and others, including the shuttle. The SPICE activity has focused on developing techniques and instrument concepts to capture particles intact and without inadvertent contamination. It began with a survey and screening of available capture media concepts and then focused on the development of a capture medium that can meet these requirements. Evaluation and development of the chosen capture medium, aerogel (a silicon oxide gel), has so far lived up to the expectations of meeting the requirements and is highlighted in a companion paper at this workshop. Others such as McDonnell's <b>Timeband</b> Capture Cell Experiment (TICCE) on EuReCa and Tsuo's GAS-CAN lid experiments on STS 47 and 57 have flown aerogel, but without addressing the contamination issue/requirement, especially regarding organics. Horz, Zolenskym and others have studied and have also been advocates for its development. The SPICE instrument's experiment design builds on the knowledge gained from these efforts to meet the intact capture, noncontamination requirements. An overview of a possible SPICE experimental instrument concept using the MIR space station as a host platform for cosmic dust collection is provided in this paper. The SPICE concept is nonplatform-specified and can fly on any platform that provides a mode for experiment recovery...|$|E
