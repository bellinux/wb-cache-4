Through a cooperative agreement with CDC, the Graduate School of Public Health at San Diego State University is assessing the relationship of personnel qualifications and laboratory performance. We have used in-depth interviews and have adapted a method of task assessment as steps in our efforts to understand technical competence. The task analysis project seeks to understand the knowledge, skills, abilities and other traits (KSAOs) that are essential to perform a sample laboratory test, in this case Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) testing for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody, in a competent versus superior manner. A standard industrial task analysis method was modified for use. Ten subject matter experts rated each of 60 selected tasks for its frequency, criticality, and difficulty. These experts then met in a facilitated focus group to identify the mental and physical behaviors and KSAOs for the five top-rated (most important) tasks. Eight KSAOs were common to all of the five top-rated tasks. The challenges of understanding personnel competence {{in the context of a}} complex <b>technology-dependent</b> <b>industry</b> are discussed. KSAOs believed essential for superio...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{research}} on nursery and grow-out rearing of prawn conducted by the SEAFDEC Aquaculture Department {{for over a decade}} are reviewed. Different rearing facilities designed to accommodate hatchery-produced prawn fry are presented with corresponding data on growth, survival and production. Studies on stocking density, fertilization/natural food production, water management, feeds and feeding schemes and harvest/post-harvest handling are evaluated and viable technology identified. Diseases, pests and predators and other factors considered as production constraints are also mentioned. The success in hatchery operation for prawn coupled by the gradual emergence of nursery and grow-out rearing technology have triggered off a <b>technology-dependent</b> prawn <b>industry.</b> When SEAFDEC AQD was established in 1973, there were very few commercial prawn monoculture ventures in the country. Prawn pond production was mostly an incidental crop in milkfish culture. At present, various prawn grow-out techniques ranging from extensive, semi-intensive and intensive culture systems are in practice. SEAFDEC AQD focused its research on the extensive and semi-intensive culture systems which are within the reach of most farmers in contrast to the intensive system that is highly capital-intensive. There have been much work done in nursery and grow-out operations, but much remains to be done in research, among which are the development of nutritionally-efficient and low-cost feed, control of diseases, etc...|$|R
