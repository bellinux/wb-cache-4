500|$|For {{the first}} time {{under the auspices of}} the Marylebone Cricket Club, an English team {{travelled}} to Australia for the 1903–04 season to contest the Ashes. Contrary to expectations before the tour, the English won the series and the Ashes three Tests to two. Hill trailed Trumper and Noble in the series averages, making 276runs at 27.60 without ever getting to 100 in an innings. In the First Test, Hill was at the centre of what Wisden described as a [...] "very regrettable and indeed disgraceful [...] demonstration". Batting with Trumper, Hill had run well past the stumps at the bowler's end for a fourth run. [...] The English return gave the Australian pair an opportunity for an overthrow. [...] Hill had to run the entire length of the pitch. [...] Albert Relf at mid-on gathered and threw to the wicket-keeper, Dick Lilley who removed the bails and appealed for the run out. [...] Umpire Bob Crockett gave Hill out. [...] Hill could not believe the decision as the ball had passed behind him when he slid his bat to make his ground. The crowd were also convinced that Hill was not out and began <b>to</b> <b>hoot,</b> chanting [...] "Crock!, Crock!, Crock!" [...] Bottles were thrown onto the surrounding cycle track and the English captain Plum Warner threatened to take his team from the ground. [...] At the end of the day, Crockett required a police escort when leaving the ground. Hill's best performance of the series was at his home town, Adelaide, in the Third Test. [...] Hill scored 88 before being dismissed by Ted Arnold, caught by the wicket-keeper. Australia won the Test by 216runs.|$|E
60|$|They began <b>to</b> <b>hoot</b> and hiss, calling Checco foul names, {{accusing him}} of causing all their troubles, naming him tyrant and usurper. Checco stood looking at them, {{trembling}} with rage. Niccolo stepped forward once more.|$|E
60|$|The sun had set; an owl began <b>to</b> <b>hoot</b> in the wood. There {{were many}} {{unpleasant}} things lying about that had much better have been buried; rabbit bones and skulls, and chickens' legs and other horrors. It was a shocking place, and very dark.|$|E
5000|$|The {{commonly}} heard call is {{distinctly different}} from that of other pygmy owls in the region: a hoo hoo lasting about two seconds, with five to fifteen seconds between double hoots. This species occasionally begins a bout of <b>hooting</b> with up <b>to</b> five <b>hoots</b> in series. It may also utter [...] "a rapid, slightly quavering huhuhu…" [...] that may lead <b>to</b> <b>hooting.</b>|$|R

60|$|In {{the turn}} of a hand public opinion had veered round. Forgetting that a while ago they were ready <b>to</b> <b>hoot</b> and mock the prisoner, the men now were equally {{prepared}} to make a rush for the bar and drag him away from that ignominious place, which they suddenly understood that he never should have occupied.|$|E
60|$|The night wore on, and Wade plodded {{under the}} {{rustling}} aspens. The insects ceased to hum, the owls <b>to</b> <b>hoot,</b> the wolves to mourn. The {{shadows of the}} long spruces gradually merged {{into the darkness of}} night. Above, infinitely high, burned the pale stars, wise and cold, aloof and indifferent, eyes of other worlds of mystery.|$|E

One man, at least, whom I know of, felt his old blood as hot for the minute as a four-year-old's. The foul curs! And <b>to</b> <b>hoot</b> her, after all! Oh that I may have one good hour's hewing at them before I die!' ...|$|E

50|$|The jocotoco antpitta {{is a large}} (150-200 g) antpitta with a {{striking}} head pattern showing tufts of white plumes beneath the eyes. It has a song similar <b>to</b> the <b>hooting</b> of the rufous-banded owl.|$|R
60|$|In {{front of}} it a fringe of elms, of all trees the tree of most {{established}} principle, bordered the stretch of turf between the gravel drive and road; and these elms were the homes of rooks of all birds the most conventional. A huge aspen--impressionable creature--shivered and shook beyond, apologising for appearance among such imperturbable surroundings. It was frequented by a cuckoo, who came once a year <b>to</b> <b>hoot</b> at the rules of life, but seldom made long stay; for boys threw stones at it, exasperated {{by the absence of}} its morals.|$|E
6000|$|The mob {{answered}} with a roaring jeer of laughter, and fresh cries of [...] "Jezebel! Jezebel!" [...] My lord only laughed the more: he was a languid gentleman: nothing seemed to excite him commonly, though I have seen him cheer and halloo the hounds very briskly, and his face (which was generally very yellow and calm) grow quite red and cheerful during a burst over the Downs after a hare, and laugh, and swear, and huzzah at a cockfight, of which sport he was very fond. And now, when the mob began <b>to</b> <b>hoot</b> his lady, he laughed with something of a mischievous look, as though he expected sport, and thought that she and they were a match.|$|E
6000|$|No {{one really}} {{believed}} Reddy Fox, {{for every one}} knows that he seldom tells the truth, but when Jimmy Skunk came mournfully down the Crooked Little Path and {{said that it was}} true, they had to believe it. Then everybody began to talk about Unc' Billy and say nice things about him and tell how much they had enjoyed having him live in the Green Forest since he came up from [...] "Ol' Virginny." [...] That is, everybody but Reddy Fox said so. Reddy said that it served Unc' Billy right, because he was of no account, anyway. Then everybody began <b>to</b> <b>hoot</b> and hiss at Reddy until he was glad enough to slink away.|$|E

6000|$|A {{little while}} later and another owl began <b>to</b> <b>hoot</b> in the distance, whereat the three head porters nudged each other. Perhaps {{they had heard}} such owls hoot before at night, and perhaps they knew that Jeekie, who had [...] "passed Bonsa," [...] could only be harmed by the direct command of Bonsa {{speaking}} through {{the mouth of the}} Asika herself. Still they might have been interested in the nocturnal conversation of those two owls, which, as is common with such magical fowl in West Africa, had transformed themselves into human shapes, the shape of Jeekie and the shape of an Asiki priest, who was, as it happened, a blood relation of Jeekie.|$|E

60|$|It was September 1429; {{the weather}} had fallen sharp; a flighty piping wind, laden with showers, beat about the township; and the dead leaves ran riot along the streets. Here and there a window was already lighted up; and the noise of men-at-arms making merry over supper within came forth in fits and was {{swallowed}} up and carried away by the wind. The night fell swiftly; the flag of England, fluttering on the spire-top, grew ever fainter and fainter against the flying clouds--a black speck like a swallow in the tumultuous, leaden chaos of the sky. As the night fell the wind rose, and began <b>to</b> <b>hoot</b> under archways and roar amid the tree-tops in the valley below the town.|$|E

60|$|Happily, timely {{diversion}} {{was made}} at this point by the bursting into the room of Jarman, who upon perceiving Mrs. Peedles, at once gave vent <b>to</b> a <b>hoot,</b> supposed <b>to</b> be expressive of Scottish joy, and without a moment's hesitation commenced to dance a reel.|$|R
60|$|Then an owl hooted again {{immediately}} {{beneath the}} fence and Jeekie, blowing out the candle, opened the flap of the tent and tapped the head porter, who stood outside, on the shoulder. He crept in and between them they lifted the senseless Aylward and bore him to the V-shaped entrance of the boma which was immediately opposite to the tent and, oddly enough, half open. Here the two other porters with whom Jeekie had performed some ceremony, chanced to be on guard, {{the rest of their}} company being stationed at a distance. Jeekie and the head porter went through the gap like men carrying a corpse to midnight burial, and presently in the darkness without two owls began <b>to</b> <b>hoot.</b>|$|E
60|$|They were fat as two aldermen; and no wonder. Placed {{around the}} edge of the big nest were a red squirrel, a rat, a chicken, a few frogs' legs, and a rabbit. Fine fare that, at eighty feet from the ground. Kookooskoos had had good hunting. All the game was partly eaten, showing I had {{disturbed}} their dinner; and only the hinder parts were left, showing that owls like the head and brains best. I left them undisturbed and came away; for I wanted to watch the young grow--which they did marvelously, and were presently learning <b>to</b> <b>hoot.</b> But I have been less merciful to the great owls ever since, thinking of the enormous destruction of game represented in raising two or three such young savages, year after year, in the same swamp.|$|E
60|$|The rabble {{of men and}} boys, more {{inclined}} <b>to</b> <b>hoot</b> at the soldier and torment him than to receive or inflict any serious wounds, gave way at the approach of signori with drawn swords, and the French soldier was interrogated. He and his companions had simply brought their prisoners into the city that they might beg money for their ransom: two of the prisoners were Tuscan soldiers taken in Lunigiana; the other, an elderly man, was with a party of Genoese, with whom the French foragers had come to blows near Fivizzano. He might be mad, but he was harmless. The soldier knew no more, being unable to understand a word the old man said. Tito heard so far, but he was deaf to everything else till he was specially addressed. It was Tornabuoni who spoke.|$|E

"You {{will not}} wonder, my lord," [...] resumed Douglas, [...] "that, when my almoner had {{read to me}} the {{contents}} of so insolent a scroll, I caused one of my squires to pluck down a trophy so disgraceful to the chivalry and nobility of Scotland. Where upon, it seems some of these saucy burghers took license <b>to</b> <b>hoot</b> and insult the hindmost of my train, who wheeled their horses on them, and would soon have settled the feud, but for my positive command that they should follow me in as much peace as the rascally vulgar would permit. And thus they arrived here {{in the guise of}} flying men, when, with my command to repel force by force, they might have set fire to the four corners of this wretched borough, and stifled the insolent churls, like malicious fox cubs in a burning brake of furze." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{most current}} and {{probable}} story, however, observes that Tom Walker grew so {{anxious about the}} fate of his wife and his property that he sat out at length to seek them both at the Indian fort. During a long summer's afternoon he searched about the gloomy place, but no wife was to be seen. He called her name repeatedly, but she was no where to be heard. The bittern alone responded to his voice, as he flew screaming by; or the bull-frog croaked dolefully from a neighboring pool. At length, it is said, just in the brown hour of twilight, when the owls began <b>to</b> <b>hoot</b> and the bats to flit about, his attention was attracted by the clamor of carrion crows that were hovering about a cypress tree. He looked and beheld a bundle tied in a check apron and hanging in the branches of a tree; with a great vulture perched hard by, as if keeping watch upon it. He leaped with joy, for he recognized his wife's apron, and supposed it to contain the household valuables.|$|E
60|$|The mistral blew in the city. The {{first day}} of that wind, {{they say in the}} {{countries}} where its voice is heard, it blows away all the dust, the second all the stones, and the third it blows back others from the mountains. It was now come to the third day; outside the pebbles flew like hail, and the face of the river was puckered, and the very building-stones in the walls of houses seemed to be curdled with the savage cold and fury of that continuous blast. It could be heard <b>to</b> <b>hoot</b> in all the chimneys of the city; it swept about the wine-shop, filling the room with eddies; the chill and gritty touch of it passed between the nearest clothes and the bare flesh; and the two gentlemen at the far table kept their mantles loose about their shoulders. The roughness of these outer hulls, for they were plain travellers’ cloaks that had seen service, set the greater mark of richness on what showed below of their laced clothes; for the one was in scarlet and the other in violet and white, like men come from a scene of ceremony; as indeed they were.|$|E
