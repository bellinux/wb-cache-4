5|$|Another coup in June 1966, the {{so-called}} Argentine Revolution, brought Juan Carlos Onganía to power. Ongania appointed Adalbert Krieger Vasena {{to head the}} Economy Ministry. His strategy implied a very active role for the public sector in guiding the process of economic growth, calling for state control over the money supply, wages and prices, and bank credit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector.</b>|$|E
5|$|A second auction was held, with {{bids for}} natural gas given equal weight to those wishing to {{transfer}} crude oil, although any natural gas bidder would be obliged to maintain the oil pumping stations {{for use in a}} national emergency. Ten bids were received and on February 8, 1947, the Texas East Transmission Corporation (TETCO) was declared successful. Its bid of $143,127,000 would make the disposal the largest sale of war-surplus property <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> following World War II.|$|E

5|$|The {{increasing}} role of {{the private}} sector forms an important trend in the ADF's logistics arrangements. During the 1990s many of the ADF's support functions were transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> to improve the efficiency with which they were provided. Since these reforms most of the 'garrison' support services at military bases have been provided by private firms. The reforms also led to many of the ADF's logistics units being disbanded or reduced in size. Since this time private firms have increasingly been contracted to provide critical support to ADF units deployed outside Australia. This support has included transporting equipment and personnel and constructing and supplying bases.|$|E
5|$|Howe's {{impatience with}} the {{necessity}} for parliamentary debate of his proposals won him few friends, and he was often accused of dictatorial conduct by the Opposition. As the Liberal government entered its third decade, it and Howe {{came to be seen}} as arrogant. The Government's attempt to impose closure in the 1956 Pipeline Debate led to major controversy in the House of Commons. In the 1957 election, Howe's actions and policies were made an issue by Opposition leader John Diefenbaker. Howe faced a serious challenge in his riding, but was expected to make speeches elsewhere as a major Liberal leader. Howe lost his seat in the election, and Diefenbaker became Prime Minister, ending almost 22years of Liberal rule. Howe returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector,</b> accepting a number of corporate directorships. The former minister died suddenly {{of a heart attack in}} December 1960.|$|E
5|$|Meyer is {{challenged}} {{in the general}} election by Southern Senator Bill O'Brien. The election ends in an Electoral College tie, but with Meyer having won the popular vote. After an ambiguous result in Nevada, the Meyer camp successfully campaigns for a recount. The recount backfires, and O'Brien keeps Nevada as a victory, as well as overtakes the popular vote. Congress must then decide who will be the President. After the House of Representatives fails to elect the President, Meyer agrees to be Vice President for her running mate Tom James, however the Senate instead elects O'Brien's running mate Laura Montez as Vice President. Due to the tied vote in the House, the office of the President is left vacant, meaning that now as Vice President, Montez immediately ascends to the presidency. As a result, James makes plans to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> while Meyer, now completely out of office, contemplates her future.|$|E

40|$|Contracting out {{of health}} {{services}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sectors</b> has been <b>the</b> subject of extensive debate and discussion among health personnel and policymakers. Outsourcing is now considered as a useful management tool for health care managers in the public sector. Outsourcing increases efficiency and service quality, reduces costs, focuses on core processes, improves skills, enhances the overall competitive advantages of the organization, and creates effective occupations in <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector.</b> <b>The</b> present study aimed <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> present status of outsourcing hospital services (i. e. radiology, laboratory, nursing, and nutrition) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sectors</b> and <b>the</b> propensity of <b>the</b> managers <b>to</b> outsourcing services in six hospitals affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The {{study was conducted in}} six hospitals of Shiraz, Iran in 2012. The study population included all hospitals managers and the sample size was 24. The findings of the study revealed that nutrition, radiology and laboratory services were being outsourced by <b>the</b> hospitals <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sectors.</b> None of <b>the</b> hospitals outsourced the nursing services. Nutrition service was outsourced by five of the six hospitals, and radiology and laboratory services were outsourced by only one hospital. The highest propensity for outsourcing services among the studied hospital managers were nutrition (87 %) followed by laboratory (73. 9 %), radiology (62. 2 %) and nursing services (43. 3 %).
