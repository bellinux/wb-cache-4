5|$|IV. Allegro. This {{movement}} {{is written in}} 6/8 and in tarantella style, and is characterised by a relentless galloping rhythm calling on demanding pianistic effects with frequent hand-crossing and leaps across registers. It employs the three-key exposition, a recurrent element in Schubert's style. The first theme shifts from C minor to C major – another Schubertian feature, and contains many allusions to D-flat major, which finally becomes established in a climactic reference to the Adagio's characteristic plagal cadence. The second theme, proceeding with <b>the</b> <b>enharmonic</b> parallel minor of this cadence (C-sharp minor), further develops the cadence in its alternation of tonic and subdominant tonalities. After a series of modulations, the exposition ends in the traditional relative major, E-flat. The development section begins in C-flat with a new theme, derived from the last bars of the exposition. Later on, additional material from the exposition is developed, gradually building up towards a climax. The recapitulation is also written in three keys; the first theme is drastically shortened, {{and this time the}} second theme veers to B-flat minor, the result being that the closing section appears in the traditional tonic. The coda begins with a long anticipatory passage which stresses A-flat, the submediant, and then reintroduces the first theme, restoring the most of the music omitted from its reprise. This last passage is characterized by sweeping arpeggios with violent dynamic contrasts - a series of subito fortissimo decaying to piano, following {{the rise and fall of}} the melody. On the last iteration, the melody hits triple forte at the zenith of its register and then plunges four octaves in a descending arpeggio, poco a poco diminuendo al pianissimo. An emphatic cadence then concludes the piece.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{his music}} is in the most {{advanced}} style of the time. His four-part vocal music usually has a highly ornamented and expressive melodic line; the differentiation of the melodic line from the others {{is one of the}} defining features of the early Baroque. Sometimes he experimented with <b>the</b> <b>Enharmonic</b> scale, or enharmonic chromaticism which required microtonal tunings; apparently he built a special pipe organ in the 1590s for playing this kind of music.|$|E
25|$|In {{approximately}} 1604/5 Valentini {{was appointed}} as organist of the Polish court chapel under Sigismund III Vasa; his first published works are dated 1609 and 1611, {{when he was}} still in Poland. In 1614 Valentini was employed by Ferdinand II (who was then the Archduke of Styria) and moved to Graz. The Graz court's music chapel used enharmonic instruments extensively, which was of considerable importance for the development of Valentini's style; a contemporary account of 1617 praises him as a virtuoso performer on <b>the</b> <b>enharmonic</b> clavicymbalum universale, seu perfectum, which had a keyboard of 77 keys spanning four octaves.|$|E

(<b>The</b> <b>enharmonic</b> genus, {{consisting}} of quarter tone, quarter tone, and major third, was rarely {{used in the}} 16th century, although Italian theorist and composer Nicola Vicentino constructed an instrument allowing it {{to be used in}} performance.)

2500|$|Modulations, {{changing}} key in {{the course}} of a piece, is another style characteristic where Bach goes beyond what was usual in his time. Baroque instruments vastly limited modulation possibilities: keyboard instruments, prior to a workable system of temperament, limited the keys that could be modulated to, and wind instruments, especially brass instruments such as trumpets and horns, about a century before they were fitted with valves, were tied to the key of their tuning. Bach pushed the limits: he added [...] "strange tones" [...] in his organ playing, confusing the singing, according to an indictment he had to face in Arnstadt, and Louis Marchand, another early experimenter with modulation, seems to have avoided confrontation with Bach because the latter went further than anyone had done before. In the [...] "Suscepit Israel" [...] of his 1723 Magnificat, he had the trumpets in E-flat play a melody in <b>the</b> <b>enharmonic</b> scale of C minor.|$|E

5000|$|Nevertheless, the {{terminology}} of the Hagiopolites somehow suggested that nenano and nana as phthorai [...] "destroy" [...] {{one or two}} diatonic degrees used within one tetarchord of a certain echos, so that <b>the</b> chromatic and <b>enharmonic</b> genera were somehow subordinated and excluded from the diatonic octoechos.
