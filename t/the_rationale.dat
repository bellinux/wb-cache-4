The final plans for the route were passed by parliament in 1968, and construction started in 1971. <b>The</b> <b>rationale</b> for {{the building of the}} station was that Frogner was to be developed as a dense, commercial district. However, to cut costs with the Oslo Tunnel, it was decided that parts of Nationaltheatret would not be built yet, and that Elisenberg Station would not open until after the tunnel was completed. By 1978, the platform area had been built, but the access way had not. The investments cost 30 million Norwegian krone (NOK), 75 mill. of 1998 standard. The Oslo Tunnel opened, without Elisenberg Station, on 1 June 1980.|$|E

I argue that the empirical and principled rationales are unfounded and that <b>the</b> ideological <b>rationale</b> is reactionary.

In relation to <b>the</b> principled <b>rationale,</b> <b>the</b> impetus for domestic violence legislation was based on isolation and inequality, which are not experienced in particular by the category of associated persons when taken as a whole. With regard to <b>the</b> ideological <b>rationale,</b> it is worrying that intimacy and equality are emerging as the touchstones of a newer rationale for domestic violence legislation, which rightly {{has more to do}} with isolation and inequality than intimacy and equality...|$|R

Eleven participants, mostly university-based science educators, were interviewed and their comments were analyzed using the methods of grounded theory (constant comparative analysis). <b>The</b> <b>rationales</b> <b>the</b> participants gave for the goal of scientific literacy for all can be grouped into at least four categories: Social Benefits of Science, Personal Benefits of Science, Promoting Humanity, and Control of Science. There are tensions between these categories because they have different implications for policy, programs and practices. There is little empirical evidence for any of <b>the</b> <b>rationales</b> discussed here; <b>the</b> participants seem to feel rationales represent philosophical or value statements, {{and they are not}} concerned by the lack of research into whether or how scientific literacy actually benefits people.

40|$|THEME This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with a commercial development of Norwegian universities, and analyzes {{some of the most}} essential forces that influence this process. With the current development it is vital to question to what extent the global commercialization of higher education affect Norwegian universities as cultural institutions. Relevant questions in addressing these issues are: - What role do the economic and <b>the</b> cultural <b>rationale</b> play in <b>the</b> justification of universities? - What forces influence the development of universities, and how do they relate to the economic and <b>the</b> cultural <b>rationale?</b> - How do stakeholders facilitate the continuance of Norwegian universities as cultural institutions? - How can universities defend their legitimacy without being either a cultural or a commercial institution? ANALYSIS Many stakeholders and processes are crucial in the development of independent research universities, and the analysis of these will be structured in four separate parts, ranging over four chapters. The first part, in chapter two, briefly touched upon the historical development of universities before some of <b>the</b> <b>rationales</b> that currently give legitimacy to universities are explored. <b>The</b> economic <b>rationale</b> is increasing its dominance in legitimizing universities compared to <b>the</b> other <b>rationales,</b> a development that can be seen in relation to global economy and policy. <b>The</b> cultural <b>rationale</b> is applied in the thesis to contrast aspects emphasized by <b>the</b> economic <b>rationale</b> in <b>the</b> justification of universities. The second part, in chapter three, examines the influence from global and international structures on the development of higher education, assuming that what concerns higher education also includes universities. The third part, in chapter four, is on two out of three coordinating forces of universities; the state and the market, mainly analyzed in relation to <b>the</b> economic <b>rationale.</b> <b>The</b> last part of the analysis, in chapter five, will explore the third university coordinating force, academic professional coordination, and its links to <b>the</b> cultural <b>rationale.</b> DISCUSSION <b>The</b> discussion, in chapter six, {{is concerned with}} strengths and weaknesses in the economic and <b>the</b> cultural <b>rationale.</b> <b>The</b> emphasis on <b>the</b> economic <b>rationale</b> spurs commercialization of universities, and <b>the</b> cultural <b>rationale</b> seems insufficient in reversing this process. Moreover, both <b>rationales</b> lack <b>the</b> capacity to secure democracy. Introducing a democratic rationale can secure and improve universities as democratic institutions concerned with free knowledge, a constructive alternative to commercialized universities driven by academic capitalism...|$|R

5|$|However, Thio Li-ann {{believes}} that it is undesirable that {{the law does not}} impose a timeframe for the calling of by-elections. If a by-election is not called promptly upon a parliamentary seat falling vacant, the electors in the GRC in question will be represented to a lesser extent. This is particularly pertinent where more than one MP vacates his or her seat or when the seat vacated is that of a minority candidate. Should the latter situation arise, <b>the</b> <b>rationale</b> behind the GRC scheme â€“ to guarantee minority representation in Parliament â€“ would be defeated.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Ministry of Justice {{considered}} reorganizing {{the search}} and rescue services, and looked into moving the 330 Squadron from Banak to Hammerfest Airport. <b>The</b> <b>rationale</b> was the proximity to Hammerfest Hospital and a typical 40-minute shorter flight time to the coast. However, such a location would give longer travel time to the inner parts of Finnmark. The plans were hindered by opposition from the Air Force, {{as they would have}} to establish a military station at Hammerfest. The Norwegian Armed Forces announced in 2007 that they would carry out a major restructuring and decrease of activity in Finnmark, with the long-term plan to close the Garrison of Porsanger.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{to ensure}} that the number of SMCs kept pace with the {{increase}} in voters and hence the number of MPs, the EBRC's terms of reference would state that there should be at least 12 SMCs. <b>The</b> <b>rationale</b> given for these changes was that the GRC scheme would work better and the link between voters and their MPs would be strengthened. In the 2011 general election, SMCs returned to Parliament 12 MPs and 15 GRCs a total of 75 MPs.|$|E

Several years later, Governor Don Sancho Fernando de Angulo y Sandoval beganâ€”without authorization from the war councilâ€”construction of a new fortress with <b>the</b> <b>rationale</b> that the San Antonio de la Eminencia castle {{did not meet the}} city's defensive requirements, as it is located on a hilltop far from the city and the coast.

5|$|Over 50% of MS {{patients}} may use complementary and alternative medicine, although numbers vary greatly {{depending on the}} definition of alternative medicine used.

The evidence for effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Examples of treatments used by patients include dietary supplementation and regimens such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin B12, and antioxidants. <b>The</b> <b>rationale</b> behind the use of Vitamin D supplementation is that studies show an association between vitamin D deficiency and increasing progression of MS, as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the court}} had no {{capacity}} to review {{the merits of the}} decision and conclude whether Jehovah's Witnesses were a threat to public order, it was sufficient that the Minister had made Order 179 with the view that the existence of Jehovah's Witnesses, which forbade national service, was contrary to public peace, welfare and good order.

USA Todays Kevin Allen placed Brodeur in a group including Roy and Sawchuk as the leading NHL goalie, noting that Brodeur had the advantage in wins.

Sportsnet's Chris Boyle, after running a statistical analysis, placed Brodeur eighth in his all-time goaltending list; he offered <b>the</b> <b>rationale</b> that Brodeur's teammates helped him achieve his major records, while goalies such as Roy and HaÅ¡ek had superior stats in their best seasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{antibiotics}} neomycin and metronidazole {{are other}} antibiotics {{used to treat}} hepatic encephalopathy. <b>The</b> <b>rationale</b> of their use {{was the fact that}} ammonia and other waste products are generated and converted by intestinal bacteria, and killing these bacteria would reduce the generation of these waste products. Neomycin was chosen because of its low intestinal absorption, as neomycin and similar aminoglycoside antibiotics may cause hearing loss and kidney failure if used by injection. Later studies showed that neomycin was indeed absorbed when taken by mouth, with resultant complications. Metronidazole, similarly, is less commonly used because prolonged use can cause nerve damage, in addition to gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E
