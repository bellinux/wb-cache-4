On February 15, 2013, Bosh was picked as an All-Star starter over the injured Rajon Rondo by coach Erik Spoelstra. <b>The</b> <b>Heat</b> achieved the league's best record and {{swept through the}} first round of the playoffs against the Milwaukee Bucks before defeating the Chicago Bulls in five games, with Bosh scoring 20 points to go with 19 rebounds in a crucial Game 3 win in Chicago. Bosh averaged 12.1 points per game throughout the playoffs, as <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> advanced to the NBA Finals to face the San Antonio Spurs following a grueling seven-game series against Indiana. <b>The</b> <b>Heat</b> and Spurs split the first two games before the Spurs blew out Miami in Game 3 to take a 2–1 series lead. In Game 4, Bosh scored 20 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to complement Wade's 32 points and James' 33 points to bolster the Heat's win, tying the series. San Antonio would bounce back in Game 5 to force <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> to win the final two games at home. In the final seconds of Game 6, James missed a three-pointer, and Bosh grabbed the offensive rebound and found a wide open Ray Allen in the corner. Allen hit the shot to tie the game, and in overtime <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> had a three-point lead with seconds left. San Antonio inbounded the ball to Danny Green, who attempted a corner three, but Green's shot was blocked by Bosh to secure the Heat's victory. Bosh was held scoreless in Game 7 by Tim Duncan, but <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> still won the game and the series to claim their second consecutive NBA Championship.|$|E

5000|$|Balancing loop - A {{balancing}} loop {{is a type}} of a feedback loop, where {{a positive}} increase of variable A causes a decrease in variable B, which in turn causes a positive increase in variable A. The behavior of such a system leads to the system finding stable state over time. Consider the behavior of a thermometer. The thermometer is a very simple device in its core. If the measured temperature exceeds a certain preconfigured value, <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> is turned off. Otherwise <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> is turned on. <b>The</b> <b>heating</b> in turn influences the temperature, forcing the thermometer to reevaluate its behavior periodically. Since there is a delay in the system (it takes a while for <b>the</b> room to <b>heat</b> up after <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> has been turned on), the temperature in the room will oscillate around the preconfigured value. This happens because when <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> is turned on, it doesn’t have an immediate effect (<b>the</b> body emitting <b>heat</b> must warm up first), causing the temperature to fall below desired level. The same effect is in play when the temperature exceeds the desired value and <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> is turned off, since it takes a while for <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> body to cool down, causing further undesired temperature increases. This behavior could be potentially mitigated by setting two separate temperature thresholds, a lower one as a signal for <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> to activate and a higher one as a signal for <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> to deactivate.|$|R
