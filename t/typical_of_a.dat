5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{description}} of a Norfolk Spaniel had changed slightly, The Spaniel Club breed standard for a Norfolk Spaniel in 1897 was for the animal to have a coat of either black and white or liver and white which was not curly, a reasonably heavy body and legs which are longer than other field spaniels but shorter than the Irish Water Spaniel, a deep chest with long sloping shoulders and strength in the back and loins, as well as features <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spaniel such as lobular ears. This standard also included the requirement for the tail to be docked. In brief, the standard described the Norfolk as simply looking like a large cocker spaniel.|$|E

5|$|Eastern South Dakota {{is home to}} most of the state's population, and the area's {{fertile soil}} is used to grow a variety of crops. West of the Missouri, {{ranching}} is the predominant agricultural activity, and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending. Most of the Native American reservations are in West River. The Black Hills, a group of low pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux, are in the southwest part of the state. Mount Rushmore, a major tourist destination, is there. South Dakota has a temperate continental climate, with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from moderate in the east to semi-arid in the west. The state's ecology features species <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> North American grassland biome.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota has a humid {{continental}} climate {{in the east}} and in the Black Hills, and a semi-arid climate in the west outside of the Black Hills, featuring four very distinct seasons, and the ecology of the state features plant and animal species <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> North American temperate grassland biome. A number of areas under the protection of the federal or state government, such as Badlands National Park, Wind Cave National Park, and Custer State Park, are located in the state.|$|E
5|$|The Parson is {{a feisty}} and {{energetic}} type of Terrier. They can excel in dog {{sports such as}} flyball or agility and require vigorous exercise {{in order to prevent}} them from becoming bored and potentially destructive in the home. They can be suited to live with children but as they have a typical Terrier temperament, they will not tolerate rough handling. The AKC describes them as being single minded, tenacious and courageous when at work, while at home they can be exuberant, playful and affectionate. However, it is unusual for dogs of this breed to be involved in work, such as fox hunting, <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small white terrier, as they are more adapted to the show bench.|$|E

Kathleen Turner guest starred in the episode as Stacy Lovell, creator of Malibu Stacy. It features cultural references to action figures such as Ken and G.I. Joe. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 11.6, and was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
5|$|Although {{observations}} of living goblin sharks are scant, its anatomy suggests its lifestyle is inactive and sluggish. Its skeleton is reduced and poorly calcified, the muscle blocks along its sides (myomeres) are weakly developed, and its fins {{are soft and}} small. Its long caudal fin, held at a low angle, is also <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> slow-swimming shark. The long snout {{appears to have a}} sensory function, as it bears numerous ampullae of Lorenzini that can detect the weak electric fields produced by other animals. Due to the snout's softness, it is unlikely to be used for stirring up prey from the bottom as has been proposed. Vision seems to be less important than other senses, considering the relatively small optic tectum in the shark's brain. Yet unlike most deep-sea sharks, it can change the size of its pupils, thus probably does use its sight in some situations. Goblin sharks may fall prey to the blue shark (Prionace glauca). Parasites documented from this species include the copepod Echthrogaleus mitsukurinae, and the tapeworms Litobothrium amsichensis and Marsupiobothrium gobelinus.|$|E
5|$|Although the low {{initially}} exhibited features <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> monsoon trough, surface observations {{suggested that}} surface pressures {{in the vicinity}} of the low began to fall on September4. Consequently, the TFCA was re-issued at 10:00UTC. Eight hours later, Dvorak intensity estimates for the storm reached T2.0/, prompting the JTWC to upgrade the system into a tropical depression, although post-storm analysis from the agency indicated that the system attained tropical depression status at 00:00UTC on September4 and tropical storm intensity at 18:00UTC that day. At 06:00UTC on September5, the JMA followed suit and classified Gerald as a tropical storm. Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Neneng. The JTWC initially expected Gerald to re-curve east of the Philippines; however, the storm's circulation remained quite shallow and embedded within the monsoon trough, causing Gerald to meander. The JMA upgraded Gerald into severe tropical storm during the evening hours of September5.|$|E

5|$|Belgrade has wildly varying {{architecture}}, {{from the}} center of Zemun, <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Central European town, to the more modern architecture and spacious layout of New Belgrade. The oldest architecture is found in Kalemegdan Park. Outside of Kalemegdan, the oldest buildings date only from the 18th century, due to its geographic position and frequent wars and destructions. The oldest public structure in Belgrade is a nondescript Turkish türbe, while the oldest house is a modest clay house on Dorćol, from late 18th century. Western influence began in the 19th century, when the city completely transformed from an oriental town to the contemporary architecture of the time, with influences from neoclassicism, romanticism, and academic art. Serbian architects took over the development from the foreign builders in the late 19th century, producing the National Theatre, Old Palace, Cathedral Church and later, in the early 20th century, the National Assembly and National Museum, influenced by art nouveau. Elements of Neo-Byzantine architecture are present in buildings such as Vuk's Foundation, old Post Office in Kosovska street, and sacral architecture, such as St. Mark's Church (based on the Gračanica monastery), and the Temple of Saint Sava.|$|E
5|$|Between the two buffer regions {{there is}} an end-point, or {{equivalence}} point, at about pH 3. This end-point is not sharp and is <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diprotic acid whose buffer regions overlap by a small amount: pKa2 − pKa1 is about three in this example. (If the difference in pK values were about two or less, the end-point would not be noticeable.) The second end-point begins at about pH  6.3 and is sharp. This indicates that all the protons have been removed. When this is so, the solution is not buffered and the pH rises steeply on addition of {{a small amount of}} strong base. However, the pH does not continue to rise indefinitely. A new buffer region begins at about pH 11 (pKw − 3), which is where self-ionization of water becomes important.|$|E
5|$|During the afternoon, {{satellites}} {{revealed that}} Laura {{had developed a}} deep warm core, a characteristic of a tropical cyclone, but the wind field remained subtropical in nature. By the nighttime hours, the radius of the strongest winds contracted to 80mi (130km), much smaller than what is <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subtropical cyclone. However, Laura was still {{under the influence of}} an upper-level low and cloud tops remained shallow. However, the cloud tops became colder overnight and Laura {{was on the verge of}} becoming a tropical cyclone by the morning of September30, but strong interaction with the upper-level low meant it was still subtropical. Despite moving over colder waters, a water vapor satellite image determined that Laura had separated itself from the upper-level low, signifying it had developed into a tropical cyclone. Laura was re-classified as a tropical storm at a relatively high latitude, 40.6°N. Not long after being declared tropical, early signs of an extratropical transition appeared. Cold air began to enter the storm on the west side and forecast models showed Laura becoming extratropical the next morning and non-tropical later the next day.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{comes from}} frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring {{long periods of}} precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures. Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool. Occasionally, warm air masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. These warm air masses can bring sunny weather, particularly during the afternoon when {{they come from the}} north or northwest {{as a result of a}} trough located in central Argentina. On the other hand, warm air masses from Brazil bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with high cloud cover that is <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime air. These warm air masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the warmest air masses, leading to the warmest temperatures. Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in warm and tropical air from the north is weaker in winter due to lower insolation, leading to the winds from the north being less intense and shorter lived.|$|E
5|$|On {{its first}} advisory, there was {{disagreement}} among forecast models regarding its eventual track, with projected tracks deviating from a Georgia landfall to a track northeastward out to sea. Alpha {{was also a}} climatological outlier at the time; the NHC HURRAN model, {{which was based on}} previous storms with similar characteristics, found no analogs for the storm. Subtropical Storm Alpha was initially well-defined as it moved southwestward. The very small center was located along {{the eastern edge of the}} convection, while low-level cloud bands formed east of the center. At the time, the temperature structure was more <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> winter storm, although it was expected to become more like a subtropical storm typical during the summer months. The winds decreased steadily as it turned more westward on May 27, and the heavy rainfall persisted mostly to the north and west of the center.|$|E
5|$|The {{species of}} Psittacosaurus vary {{in size and}} {{specific}} features of the skull and skeleton, but share the same overall body shape. The best-known—P. mongoliensis—can reach 2metres (6.5ft) in length. The maximum adult body weight was most likely over 20kilogrammes (44lb) in P. mongoliensis. Several species approach P. mongoliensis in size (P. lujiatunensis, P. neimongoliensis, P. xinjiangensis), while others are somewhat smaller (P. sinensis, P. meileyingensis). The smallest known species, P. ordosensis, is 30% smaller than P. mongoliensis. The largest are P. lujiatunensis and P. sibiricus, although neither is significantly larger than P. mongoliensis. Psittacosaurus postcranial skeletons are more <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 'generic' bipedal ornithischian.
