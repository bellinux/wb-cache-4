You may say that you go to work with bright hopes, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be discouraged by the slowness of your progress; for you have to recover not only what has been lost in transplanting the Negro race from its native soil to this continent, but you must reach higher levels than your ancestors ever had attained.|$|E

500|$|At dawn on {{the morning}} of 6 November 1914, in cold, foggy and bleak weather, Lody was fetched from his cell by the Assistant Provost-Marshal, Lord Athlumney. He asked, [...] "I suppose <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> care to shake hands with a German spy?", to which the reply came, [...] "No. But I will shake hands with a brave man." [...] A small {{procession}} formed up for the short journey to the rifle range, comprising Lody and his armed escort, the Tower's Chaplain and the eight-man firing squad.

500|$|Elizabeth's senior adviser, William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, died on 4 August 1598. His {{political}} mantle {{passed to}} his son, Robert Cecil, who soon became {{the leader of}} the government. One task he addressed was to prepare the way for a smooth succession. Since Elizabeth would never name her successor, Cecil was obliged to proceed in secret. He therefore entered into a coded negotiation with James VI of Scotland, who had a strong but unrecognised claim. Cecil coached the impatient James to humour Elizabeth and [...] "secure the heart of the highest, to whose sex and quality nothing is so improper as either needless expostulations or over much curiosity in her own actions". The advice worked. James's tone delighted Elizabeth, who responded: [...] "So trust I <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> doubt but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as my thanks cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them to you in grateful sort". In historian J. E. Neale's view, Elizabeth may not have declared her wishes openly to James, but she made them known with [...] "unmistakable if veiled phrases".|$|E
500|$|In late January 1567, Mary {{prompted}} {{her husband}} to return to Edinburgh. He recuperated from his illness in a house belonging to the brother of Sir James Balfour at the former abbey of Kirk o' Field, just within the city wall. Mary visited him daily, so that it appeared a reconciliation was in progress. On the night of 9–10 February 1567, Mary visited {{her husband in the}} early evening and then attended the wedding celebrations of a member of her household, Bastian Pagez. In {{the early hours of the}} morning, an explosion devastated Kirk o' Field, and Darnley was found dead in the garden, apparently smothered. There were no visible marks of strangulation or violence on the body. Bothwell, Moray, Secretary Maitland, the Earl of Morton and Mary herself were among those who came under suspicion. Elizabeth wrote to Mary of the rumours, [...] "I should ill fulfil the office of a faithful cousin or an affectionate friend if I did not... tell you what all the world is thinking. Men say that, instead of seizing the murderers, you are looking through your fingers while they escape; <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> seek revenge on those who have done you so much pleasure, as though the deed would never have taken place had not the doers of it been assured of impunity.

[...] Unless there is a particularly good reason, I hope <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> abandon him. [...] As to my Zhangsun clan, many of them enjoy high salaries and high positions on account of our marriage, not because of their great virtues, and therefore they can crumble easily. [...] In order to preserve the Zhangsuns, I hope <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> put them in powerful positions, and that they would be satisfied with seeing you at imperial gatherings the first and 15th day of each month.

2500|$|In 1333–4, a {{group of}} {{students}} and tutors from Merton and Brasenose Colleges, dissatisfied with conditions at their university, left Oxford to establish a rival college at Stamford. Oxford and Cambridge universities petitioned Edward III, and the King ordered the closure of the college and the return of the students to Oxford. Oxford MA students were obliged to swear the following: [...] "You shall also swear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> read lectures, or hear them read, at Stamford, as in a University study, or college general", an oath which remained in place until 1827.

2500|$|Gasparri {{approached}} Ratti before voting {{began on}} the third day and told him he would urge his supporters to switch their votes to Ratti, who was shocked to hear this. When it became clear that neither Gasparri nor del Val could win, the cardinals approached Ratti, thinking him a compromise candidate not identified with either faction. Cardinal Gaetano de Lai approached Ratti and was believed to have said: [...] "We will vote for Your Eminence if Your Eminence will promise <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> choose Cardinal Gasparri as your secretary of state". Ratti is said to have responded: [...] "I hope and pray that among so highly deserving cardinals the Holy Spirit selects someone else.

The whole thing is utterly impossible and utterly fascinating. It is the most baffling mystery that Agatha Christie has ever written, and if any other writer has ever surpassed it for sheer puzzlement the name escapes our memory. We are referring, of course, to mysteries that have logical explanations, as this one has. It is a tall story, to be sure, but it could have happened." ...|$|E
