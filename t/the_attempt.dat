5|$|A classic {{error is}} <b>the</b> <b>attempt</b> {{to use the}} equals {{operator}} = {{in combination with the}} keyword NULL to find rows with Nulls. According to the SQL standard this is an invalid syntax and shall lead to an error message or an exception. But most implementations accept the syntax and evaluate such expressions to UNKNOWN. The consequence is that no rows are found - regardless of whether rows with Nulls exist or not. The proposed way to retrieve rows with Nulls is the use of the predicate IS NULL instead of = NULL.|$|E

5|$|After the {{generally}} failed assaults on the bridges, the German divisions began crossing attempts over the rivers IJssel and Maas.

At most places a secondary bombardment destroyed the pillboxes and the infantry divisions crossed the river after building pontoon bridges; but at some, as Venlo, <b>the</b> <b>attempt</b> was aborted.

5|$|Appalachian State {{continued}} their drive but {{were forced to}} punt after being stopped on 3rd down. Michigan began their drive at the Appalachian State 34-yard line, but a Henne pass was intercepted by Mountaineer defender Leonard Love on the fourth play of the drive. Love returned the ball 26-yards, and Appalachian State began the drive at their own 41-yard line, but were forced to punt after going three-and-out. Michigan got the ball at their own 24-yard line and mounted a nine-play, 43-yard drive to the Appalachian State 33-yard line. On the final play, a fourth and five, Henne's pass fell incomplete, turning the ball over to Appalachian State, who were again quickly forced to punt. After returning the punt to their own 46-yard line, Hart ran the ball 54yards for a touchdown, giving Michigan the lead 32–31 with 4:36 left. Michigan chose to go for two, but the conversion attempt failed. Edwards was picked off on the first play of the ensuing drive, giving Michigan control of the ball at the Appalachian State 43-yard line. Michigan ran five plays before attempting a 43-yard field goal. <b>The</b> <b>attempt</b> was blocked, however, giving Appalachian State control of the ball with 1:37 left. With no timeouts left, the Mountaineers drove 69yards down the field in just over a minute in game time, setting up a Rauch field goal from 24yards out with 26seconds left. <b>The</b> <b>attempt</b> was good, giving Appalachian State a 34–32 lead. Michigan regained control of {{the ball on the}} ensuing kickoff, and a 46-yard pass from Henne to Mario Manningham gave the Wolverines a 37-yard field goal attempt with six seconds left on the clock. <b>The</b> <b>attempt</b> was blocked by Corey Lynch, securing a 34–32 win by the Mountaineers.|$|E
5|$|Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu was {{released}} on 14 January 1959, during the Makar Sankranti festival season.

5|$|Braun herself {{attempted}} suicide on 10 or 11 August 1932 by shooting {{herself in the}} chest with her father's pistol.

After Braun's recovery, Hitler became more committed to her {{and by the end}} of 1932 they had become lovers. She often stayed overnight at his Munich apartment when he was in town. Beginning in 1933, Braun worked as a photographer for Hoffmann. This position enabled her to travel—accompanied by Hoffmann—with Hitler's entourage as a photographer for the Nazi Party.
