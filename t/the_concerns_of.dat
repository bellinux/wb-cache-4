5|$|Although {{the most}} {{powerful}} individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> the plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. In 28BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.|$|E

5|$|At 21:30 Forte and the {{captured}} merchant ships were visible from Sybille, Forte brilliantly illuminated {{in the tropical}} night. Cooke brought Sybille westwards {{in order to take}} the weather gage before wearing and bearing down on the French ship, under a light wind from the southwest. Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles sails were clearly identified on Forte but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: he seems to have thought that the sails belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> his officers, or that he wished to lure Sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, Victorian {{scholars}} such as William Stubbs, James Ramsay, and William Hunt {{sought to}} understand how the English political system had evolved under Henry. They explored the emergence of Parliamentary institutions during his reign, and sympathized with <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> the chroniclers over the role of the Poitevins in England. This focus carried on into early 20th-century research into Henry, such as Kate Norgate's 1913 volume, which continued to make heavy use of the chronicler accounts and focused primarily on constitutional issues, with a distinctive nationalistic bias.|$|E
5|$|Calvert, {{a former}} high {{official}} {{in the government of}} King James I, asked the Privy Council for permission to build a colony, to be called Carolina, on land south of the Virginia settlements in area of the modern-day North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Claiborne arrived soon afterwards and expressed <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> Virginia that its territorial integrity was being threatened. He was joined in his protests by a group of London merchants who planned to build a sugar colony in the same area. Claiborne, still intent on his own project, received a royal trading commission through one of his London supporters in 1631, one which granted him the right to trade with the natives on all lands in the mid-Atlantic where there was not already a patent in effect.|$|E

5|$|Feminism was {{challenged}} by various minority groups for not entirely addressing {{the needs of}} minority populations. It was suggested that 'mainstream' feminism was upper caste and Hindu in its orientation and did not address <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> minority women. This {{led to the formation of}} the Awaaz-e-Niswaan (The Voice of Women) in 1987 in Mumbai in largely Muslim part of the city. The Muslim community has personal laws that often were considered harmful to the rights of Muslim women. The Muslim personal law allows Polygamy but not Polyandry.|$|E
5|$|In June 1816, the French frigate Méduse {{departed}} from Rochefort, {{bound for the}} Senegalese port of Saint-Louis. She headed a convoy of three other ships: the storeship Loire, the brig Argus and the corvette Écho. Viscount Hugues Duroy de Chaumereys had been appointed captain of the frigate despite having scarcely sailed in 20years. After the wreck, public outrage mistakenly attributed responsibility for his appointment to Louis XVIII, though his was a routine naval appointment made within the Ministry of the Navy and far outside <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> the monarch. The frigate's mission was to accept the British return of Senegal {{under the terms of}} France's acceptance of the Peace of Paris. The appointed French governor of Senegal, Colonel Julien-Désiré Schmaltz, and his wife and daughter were among the passengers.|$|E

Though he gave his consent, his father was disappointed that his second son did not do more to advance <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> Coburg.

In the early career of the Company, Van Rensselaer was one of its mainstays, placing several of his vessels at its disposal and twice advancing money to save its credit.

He oversaw a $1.32billion total budget, 700employees, and 26,000volunteers. The federal government provided approximately $400million to $600million of that budget, much of it a result of Romney's having aggressively lobbied Congress and federal agencies. It was a record level of federal funding for the staging of a U.S. Olympics. An additional $1.1billion of indirect federal funding came to the state in the form of highway and transit projects.|$|E

5|$|Teaneck {{was created}} on February19, 1895 by {{an act of}} the New Jersey Legislature from {{portions}} of Englewood Township and Ridgefield Township, both of which are now defunct (despite existing municipalities with similar names), along with portions of Bogota and Leonia. Independence followed the result of a referendum held on January14, 1895, in which voters favored incorporation by a 46–7 margin. To address <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> Englewood Township's leaders, the new municipality was formed as a township, rather than succumbing to the borough craze sweeping across Bergen County at the time. On May3, 1921, and June1, 1926, portions of what had been Teaneck were transferred to Overpeck Township.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s {{ushered in}} a period of wide-ranging social and {{political}} changes, stemming largely from <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> the French speaking majority about the conservation of their culture and language, given the traditional predominance of the English Canadian minority in the business arena. The October Crisis and the 1976 election of the Parti Québécois, supporting sovereign status for Quebec, resulted in the departure of many businesses and people from the city. In 1976 Montreal was the host of the Olympics. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Montreal experienced a slower rate of economic growth than many other major Canadian cities.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} refined further by {{director}} Val Guest, who cut 30 pages from Landau's script. One of Guest's key {{contributions to the}} script was to tailor the dialogue to suit the brusque style of star Brian Donlevy. With an American actor cast as Quatermass, Guest reverted Briscoe to a British character and reinstated Quatermass's title of professor. Guest also adapted some sections of the script in response to <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> the BBFC. Further stylistic changes were sought by the BBC who retained a script approval option after {{the sale of the}} rights and asked Nigel Kneale to work on their suggested changes, much to his indignation. Kneale was tasked with rewriting any scenes featuring BBC announcers to match the BBC's news reporting style.|$|E

5|$|There {{was also}} {{increased}} environmental {{concern in the}} Soviet Union. In the mid-1950s, Soviet scientists began taking regular radiation readings near Leningrad, Moscow, and Odessa and collected data on the prevalence of strontium-90, which indicated that strontium-90 levels in western Russia approximately matched those in the eastern US. Rising Soviet concern was punctuated in September 1957 by the Kyshtym disaster, which forced the evacuation of 10,000 people after an explosion at a nuclear plant. Around the same time, 219 Soviet scientists signed Pauling's antinuclear petition. Soviet political elites did not share <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> others in Soviet Union, however; Kurchatov unsuccessfully called on Khrushchev to halt testing in 1958.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the thirteenth century, the Bilwis is less and less {{frequently}} treated as the personification of a supernatural power but becomes increasingly identified as a malevolent human being, a witch. Still later, with the rise of the witch persecution {{at the end of the}} Middle Ages, the Bilwis was demonized; she becomes an incarnation of the devil for the witch and sorcerer. A final development has taken place since the sixteenth century, especially in northeast Germany, the Bilwis has been conceived of as a grain spirit bringing wealth; yet this latest manifestation of the Bilwis has its harmful side, the Bilwis-cutter, who is blamed for the unexplained patterns that are formed among the rows of standing grain. The cutter is a sorcerer or witch that cuts down the corn with sickles that are fastened to its feet. He is classified as an essentially malevolent Corn Spirit. Thus, the Bilwis is exceedingly polymorphous, taking on many appearances and meaning in all German-speaking areas throughout the Middle Ages. The Bilwis is one of the strangest and most mysterious beings in all folklore; its varying forms reflect <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> a farm culture, and it serves to explain the eerie appearance of turned-down rows of plants in cornfields.|$|E
5|$|Fermi's Chicago Pile-1 reactor, {{constructed}} {{under the}} west viewing stands {{of the original}} Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, went critical on December 2, 1942. This graphite-moderated reactor only generated up to 200 W, but it demonstrated that k was higher than anticipated. This not only removed most of the objections to air-cooled and water-cooled reactor designs, it greatly simplified {{other aspects of the}} design. Wigner's team submitted blueprints of a water-cooled reactor to DuPont in January 1943. By this time, <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> DuPont's engineers about the corrosiveness of water had been overcome by the mounting difficulties of using helium, and all work on helium was terminated in February. At the same time, air cooling was chosen for the reactor at the pilot plant. Since it would be of a quite different design from the production reactors, the X-10 Graphite Reactor lost its value as a prototype, but its value as a working pilot facility remained, providing plutonium needed for research. It was hoped that problems would be found in time to deal with them in the production plants. The semiworks would also be used for training, and for developing procedures.|$|E
