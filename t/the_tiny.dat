5|$|After passing Land's End {{the path}} {{continues}} further south past Pordenack Point and Mill Bay before turning fully eastward at Gwennap Head. Beyond <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> village of Porthgwarra lies St Levan. The next bay lies below Porthcurno. It is overlooked by the open-air Minack Theatre and {{is where the}} Eastern Cable Company's cable came ashore, the first telegraph link with India. Climbing out of the bay the path passes the precarious Logan Rock.|$|E
5|$|Among myriapods, millipedes have {{traditionally}} been considered most closely related to <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> pauropods, although some molecular studies challenge this relationship. Millipedes can be distinguished from the somewhat similar but only distantly related centipedes (class Chilopoda), which move rapidly, are carnivorous, and have only {{a single pair of}} legs on each body segment. The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.|$|E

5|$|Antlion larvae require loose soil, not {{necessarily}} but often sand. The larvae prefer dry places {{protected from the}} rain. When it first hatches, <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> larva specialises in very small insects, but as it grows larger, it constructs larger pits, and thus catches larger prey, sometimes much larger than itself.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{usually have}} a single {{circular}} chromosome, {{with as many as}} 5,751,492base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans, the largest known archaeal genome. <b>The</b> <b>tiny</b> 490,885base-pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans is one-tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, are also found in archaea. Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact, in a process that may be similar to bacterial conjugation.|$|E
5|$|As the RSPB's busiest reserve, Titchwell Marsh has a {{significant}} economic impact on its locality. A 2002 survey reported that an estimated 137,700 visitors spent £1.8million locally in 1998. <b>The</b> <b>tiny</b> village of Titchwell has two three-star hotels and a shop selling telescopes and binoculars, although {{it does not have}} a general store or a public house.|$|E

5|$|Ayer {{has been}} a major {{railroad}} interchange since the Fitchburg Railroad opened through South Groton in 1845, followed by the Stony Brook Railroad, Worcester and Nashua Railroad, and Peterborough and Shirley Railroad in 1848. The original depot was replaced with a union station with a large trainshed in 1848. Land speculation and industrial development spurred by the railroad access expanded <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> farm village into the independent town of Ayer.|$|E
5|$|Gaming {{peripheral}} company Hori produced PlayStation 2 controllers {{modeled after}} <b>the</b> <b>Tiny</b> Bee guns Yuna uses in Final Fantasy X-2. These controllers were released only in Japan. They were re-released {{in a new}} silver box {{to coincide with the}} release of Final Fantasy X-2: International+Last Mission. They also released a vertical stand for the console with a Final Fantasy X-2 logo that lights up in blue color when plugged into a powered console.|$|E
5|$|Gas bubbles with a radius {{greater than}} 1 micron should float {{to the surface}} of a {{standing}} liquid, whereas smaller ones should dissolve rapidly due to surface tension. <b>The</b> <b>Tiny</b> Bubble Group has been able to resolve this apparent paradox by developing and experimentally verifying a new model for stable gas nuclei.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the Minoan eruption, {{the walls of the}} caldera formed a nearly {{continuous}} ring of islands with the only entrance lying between Thera and <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> island of Aspronisi. This cataclysmic eruption was centered on a small island just north of the existing island of Nea Kameni in the centre of the then-existing caldera. The northern part of the caldera was refilled by the volcanic ash and lava, then collapsed again.|$|E

5|$|Inflorescences (clusters of flowers) of {{at least}} 60plant {{families}} are eaten by lemurs {{ranging in size from}} <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> mouse lemurs to the relatively large ruffed lemurs. If the flowers are not exploited, sometimes the nectar is consumed (nectarivory) along with the pollen (palynivory). At least 24native species from 17plant families are targeted for nectar or pollen consumption.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} sundews are self-fertile; their flowers will often self-pollinate upon closing. Often, {{numerous}} seeds are produced. <b>The</b> <b>tiny</b> black seeds germinate {{in response to}} moisture and light, while seeds of temperate species also require cold, damp, stratification to germinate. Seeds of the tuberous species require a hot, dry summer period followed by a cool, moist winter to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Minnie Island State Park offers {{opportunities}} for picnicking and fishing to visitors who reach it by boat. Though the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection lists boating as an activity, which is redundant because {{the island is}} accessible by boat. The Oh Ranger website advises visitors of <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> island to use a kayak to access the island because the island is heavily wooded {{and it is difficult}} to find a spot to dock.|$|E

5|$|Special springs can {{be found}} {{near the top of}} certain acts. By jumping onto these springs, the player can reach a special stage, where they are sent falling down a tube on a {{snowboard}} while trying to collect enough rings to meet the target amount. By completing the stage, the player receives a Chaos Emerald. Collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds unlocks the game's true ending. The game also features a minigame called <b>the</b> <b>Tiny</b> Chao Garden, in which players can raise Chao. Players can transfer their Chao between <b>the</b> <b>Tiny</b> Chao Garden and the Chao Garden from the GameCube versions of Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2. The game also features a competitive multiplayer mode, where up to four owners of the game can race {{to the end of a}} level or search for Chao.|$|E
5|$|The Fitchburg Railroad {{main line}} opened on an east-west {{alignment}} through <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> village of South Groton in Groton, Massachusetts in December 1845. Following a town vote the previous year, Groton station was established at Flannigan's Crossing (Groton-Harvard Road).
