About a decade after delivery, the train type experienced a notable <b>technical</b> <b>accident</b> on 1 May 2009 when a wheel broke at station Kaulsdorf. An investigation showed that the wheels were built too lightly and the brakes were not properly dimensioned according to {{state of the art}} - this led to a plan to replace all wheel sets on all trains of this type. The operator reconstructed a repair shop to do it but the replacement works were running too slow so that inspection intervals were run over regularly (where intervals had been shortened due to the wheel problem). When the acceptable margin was overrun as well, the federal regulator dropped the allowance for operation for 100 rail cars which led to serious transport problems in Berlin rapid transit in 2010. Further problems came up at the height of winter 2011 leading again into transport problems requiring further reconstruction of motors and sanding equipment.|$|E

40|$|The key {{question}} {{addressed by the}} literature on money and growth {{is whether or not}} changes in the rate of monetary expansion have real effects on the growth path of the economy. This question is usually phrased in terms of the superneutrality of money. Superneutrality is distinguished from the more commonly used term of neutrality by the former’s reference to monetary growth rates, as distinct from one-shot changes in the money stock; superneutrality is thus a dynamic concept of neutrality. Superneutrality has also appeared in the literature in the guise of the natural rate of interest. The idea of a natural rate of return on capital, determined solely by real factors and thereby invariant to monetary behaviour is an attractive concept. The proposition is usual attributed to Wicksell although its recent popularization owes much to Friedman’s influential 1968 Presidential address. The early contributions to the literature, based on descriptive analysis, unanimously rejected superneutrality. They argued that money and capital are substitutes in the eyes of portfolio holders. A change in the rate of monetary expansion chnages the rate of inflation and thus the rate of return on real money balances. In principle this should set in motion a complex interaction of income and substitution effects which would alter the equilbrium of the economy. This view was largely overthrown by Sidrauski who put forward a model based on explicit optimization in which the real economy was invariant to the rate of monetary expansion. The accepted interpretation of his model is that far-sighted individuals “see through” the veil of money, and choose a pattern of behaviour that will set the economy on an optimal real expansion path. Sidrauski’s work appeared {{at the same time that}} Friedman was expounding his views on the natural rate of interest, and between them they have dominated thinking on this topic for a decade or more. Recently, however, several economists have expressed doubts about some of Sidrauski’s assumptions. The main objective of this paper is to determine whether Sidrauski’s results depend on unrealistically restrictive assumptions, and if so, whether anything can be said about the likely direction of any real effects associated with a change in the monetary growth rate. The essence of Sidrauski’s model is utility-maximization over time by an immortal household. The household has preferences over consumption in each period and real money balances. The apparent weak links in his model are: (i) the infinite horizon of the individuals involved (ii) the assumption that all individuals are identical and have the same rate of time discount (iii) the assumption that the individuals like consumption in all periods equally except for the use of the time discount rate to weight current consumption higher than future consumption (iv) the assumption that the production process is independent of money balances held by firms and (v) the assumption that money yields a return to the individual that varies with the amount held. Using an overlapping-generations framework in which individuals live for a finite length of time, but are still linked to the future by concern for their children it is possible to replicate Sidrauski’s superneutrality result. The advantage of this approach is that, unlike Sidrauski’s original model, the overlapping generations model allows a much wider range of alternative assumptions. Indeed, it is shown that superneutrality requires all five of the assumptions listed above. Superneutrality has little to do with the long-sightedness of Sidrauski’s household. It is more accurately described as a <b>technical</b> <b>accident</b> of combining certain types of assumptions. When any one of these assumptions is abandoned, monetary growth has real effects. What are these real effects? From the assumptions listed above it should be apparent that superneutrality requires two types of restrictions on the productive process and on the behaviour of individual consumers. Real effects can be generated by relaxing either of these two sides of the model. In general the effects will be an indeterminate mixture of income and substitution effects. There are, however, two cases in which an unambiguous outcome can be predicted. The first, due to Dornbusch and Frenkel arises when we relax the production side of the model to allow money to affect production directly as an input. In this case, an increase in the monetary growth rate will decrease the real growth rate of output provided cross-effects are positive (that is, an increase in the price of one good increases the demand for all other goods) and own-effects are dominant (that is, the demand (supply) for each good responds more to movements in its own price than it does to movements in the prices of other goods). The essence of this result is that since money and capital are usually hypothesised to be complementary inputs in production, a decrease in the rate of return on money will lead to a reduction in the use of money and, through complementarity, a reduction in the use of capital. The second arises when we relax the restrictions on the consumer (e. g. assumptions (i) -(iii), and (v) above). In this case an increase in the rate of monetary growth will increase the real rate of growth of output if money is held at the margin purely for its properties as an asset. If this is the case, the financial returns on money and capital will be forced into alignment. A decrease in the rate of return on money will decrease the rate of return on capital thereby implying a higher capital-labour ratio. ...|$|E

30|$|Enhancement of {{technology}} and techniques for drilling deep directed oil and gas bore hole {{is one of the}} most important problems of the current petroleum industry. Not infrequently, the drilling of these bore holes is attended by occurrence of extraordinary situations associated with <b>technical</b> <b>accidents.</b> Among these is the Eulerian loss of stability of a drill string in the channel of a curvilinear bore hole. Methods of computer simulation should play a dominant role in prediction of these states. In this paper, a new statement of the problem of critical buckling of the drill strings in 3 D curvilinear bore holes is proposed. It is based on combined use of the theory of curvilinear elastic rods, Eulerian theory of stability, theory of channel surfaces, and methods of classical mechanics of systems with nonlinear constraints. It is noted that the stated problem is singularly perturbed and its solutions have the shapes of localized harmonic wavelets. The calculation results showed that the friction effects lead to essential redistribution of internal axial forces, as well as changing the eigenmode shapes and sites of their localization. These features make the buckling phenomena less predictable and raise the role of computer simulation of these effects.|$|R
40|$|Following {{a drought}} period (1995 - 2010) in the Matruh region in Egypt and an {{increase}} in feed prices, traditional Bedouin sheep production systems based on transhumance on rangelands have incurred a reduction in flocks by 50 to 80 %. Recently, a strong development of broiler production was observed. It is based on intensive medium-scale production, with a constant technical model of 5000 broilers in 600 m² poultry sheds of local conception. In 10 years the production around MM raised from almost zero to more than 20 million birds / year (illustrated in Figure 1). It already represents more than 2 % of the total Egyptian poultry production. Feed factories have been built, while day-old chicks still come from Alexandria or Cairo. Short-term profitability of poultry production is high, thanks to limited investment (15, 000 USD/building) well controlled production costs and low manpower costs. Under good conditions, the return on investment is obtained in less than a year. However, the economic model is highly sensitive to uncontrolled factors such as high feed prices, low broiler selling prices, or even to <b>technical</b> <b>accidents</b> such as high mortality rates in summer. This example shows how modern poultry farming is a small scale family activity which is a way to adapt to the drought conditions of the last 15 years in a context where animal production was previously more extensive and traditional. It is however difficult to estimate its sustainability in this type of environment...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} occurrence of natural disasters, humanitarian emergency situations and civil endangerment, {{there is a growing}} need for timely information on rapidly evolving events. Satellite imagery can provide valuable information in emergency, crisis or disaster situation. Having recognized this need, an increasing number of space agencies are developing and operating infrastructures and services to offer earth observation resources to provide information for disaster management and humanitarian relief efforts. Experiences and results from that work are reported. It is described how data flows, analysis methods and information networks can be improved to allow better and faster access to remote sensing data and information in order to support the management of crisis situations effectively. This refers to all phases of a crisis or disaster situation, including pre¬paredness, response and recovery. Above the infrastructure and information flow elements, example cases of different crisis situations in the context of natural disasters, humanitarian relief activities and civil security are pre¬sented and discussed. This builds on the experiences gained during the last six years.
