50|$|In {{order to}} print, thermo-sensitive paper is {{inserted}} between the thermal {{head and the}} platen. The printer sends an electric current to the heating elements of the thermal head, which generate heat. The heat activates the thermo-sensitive coloring layer of the <b>thermosensitive</b> <b>paper,</b> which changes color where heated. Such a printing mechanism {{is known as a}} thermal system or direct system. The heating elements are usually arranged as a matrix of small closely spaced dots—thermal printers are actually dot-matrix printers, though they are not called such.|$|E
40|$|Certain leuco dyestuffs {{are known}} to exhibit a {{brilliant}} color by reaction with a phenolic developer; 2 -[(4 -hydroxyphenyl) sulfonyl]-phenol (BPS) is a well-known developer for black leuco dyes such as 6 -(diethylamino) - 3 -methyl- 2 -(phenylamino) - spiro[isobenzofuran- 1 (3 H), 9 -[9 H]-xanhen]- 3 -one (ODB) in <b>thermosensitive</b> <b>papers.</b> Although BPS is a small molecule (molecular weight: about 250), it is thermally stable as characterized by a high melting point of about 184 °C. Furthermore, the stability of BPS is also extended to the 1 : 1 “leuco/developer” system. In this connection, structure analysis of BPS {{has been carried out}} in order to elucidate the stability of BPS itself as well as its leuco/developer system. Then, we found that one BPS molecule is hydrogen bonded to four different neighboring ones, forming an OH¯O two-dimensional hydrogen-bond network. This ensures a high thermal stability of BPS. On the other hand, in the ODB/BPS system, only one of the four hydrogen bonds in BPS is used for the formation of the 1 : 1 ODB/BPS colorant while the remaining three hydrogen bonds keep the network. As for the tinctorial strength in spin-coated ODB/BPS, the color intensity is found to be limited to about 70 % of the maximum available value. This is because there is a fraction of ODB molecules, whose lactone ring is still closed owing to the steric hindrance...|$|R
