To answer this question, we have compared the relative growth performance of 14 “tourism countries ” within a sample of 143 countries, observed during the period 1980 - 95. Using standard OLS cross-country growth regressions, we have documented that the <b>tourism</b> <b>countries</b> grow significantly faster than all the other sub-groups considered in our analysis (OECD, Oil, LDC, Small). Moreover, we have shown that the reason why they are growing faster is neither that they are poorer than the average; nor that they have particularly high saving/investment propensities; nor that they are very open to trade. In other words, the positive performance of the <b>tourism</b> <b>countries</b> is not significantly accounted for by the traditional growth factors of the Mankiw, Romer and Weil type of models. Tourism specialization appears to be an independent determinant. A corollary of our findings is that the role played by the tourism sector should not be ignored by the debate about whether smallness is harmful for growth (e. g.

40|$|International data on per-capita income show that, in {{the last}} few years, growth in some <b>countries</b> {{specialized}} in <b>tourism</b> was faster than in the average country included in the World Bank-World Development Indicators. Fast growth in <b>tourism</b> <b>countries</b> might be due to fast, unsustainable exploitation of a given endowment of natural resources, or to a more robust and sustainable phenomenon (due for instance to the existence of a favourable trend in the terms of trade between tourism and other activities). To date, little analytical or empirical studies are available to explain such a performance and the underlying mechanisms. This is unfortunate. For instance, {{a better understanding of the}} above issues is crucial to assess the role tourism can play in less developed countries and regions. The main objective of our paper is to fill this gap in the current literature. We address the following questions: (i) What are the economic mechanisms capable to generate fast growth in tourism countries' (ii) How empirically robust is the positive relationship between faster growth and tourism specialization? (iii) Is the growth path associated to tourism specialization sustainable? We use a two-sector endogenous growth model to address question (i). In particular, we define the conditions required for small countries to specialise in tourism and to enter the faster growth path. Our suggestion is that what matters is, first, a country 2 ̆ 019 s relative endowment of the natural resource, and, second, a low elasticity of substitution between tourism services and other consumption goods, so that the terms of trade move fast enough in favour of the <b>tourism</b> <b>countries.</b> Question (ii) is addressed by means of standard cross-section and panel growth regressions aimed at testing whether specialisation in tourism is robustly associated with faster than average per capita growth in international dataset over the last twenty years.

For this purpose, two models of growth and trade are constructed to represent the trade relations between two countries. One of the countries is large, rich, has an own source of sustained growth and produces a tradable capital good. The other is a small poor economy, which {{does not have an}} own engine of growth and produces tradable tourism services. The poor country exports tourism services to and imports capital goods from the rich economy. In one model tourism is a luxury good, while in the other the expenditure elasticity of tourism imports is unitary. Two main results are obtained. In the long run, the <b>tourism</b> <b>country</b> overcomes decreasing returns and permanently grows because its terms of trade continuously improve. Since the tourism sector is relatively less productive than the capital good sector, tourism services become relatively scarcer and hence more expensive than the capital good. Moreover, along the transition the growth rate of the tourism economy holds well above the one of the rich country for a long time. The growth rate differential between countries is particularly high when tourism is a luxury good. In this case, there is a faster increase in the tourism demand. As a result, investment of the small economy is boosted and its terms of trade highly improve. High growth, Small tourism countries, Terms of trade, Luxury good, Dynamic general equilibrium. ...|$|E

Also the Lebanese culture is a combination of various civilizations and religions which provide the country with a unique culture. However, Lebanon was under the shadow of civil war for almost 15 years, this destroyed the economy of the country. It led to a rapid drop of more than 50 % of the GDP and resulted in Lebanon losing its position as the preferred port that links Middle East to the western countries. Also Lebanon was known as the Middle East banking centre. In the current scenario Lebanon is in the process of re-establishing itself which opens up new opportunities for new businesses especially in the tourism and service sectors. These two sectors are considered to have the highest contribution to the Lebanese economy. This has led to an increase in the importance of the foodservice sector. Lebanese people are very sociable and always like to try different kinds of food and experience new things. And since Lebanon is a <b>tourism</b> <b>country,</b> this makes the restaurants business very attractive and at the same time makes the foodservices industry in Lebanon very competitive. So due to the vast options of restaurants for customers, restaurants’ management should always be up to date and provide them with new experiences. Most of the restaurants in Lebanon are known for their high standard of quality and mostly all the cuisines are available. However, what distinguishes a restaurant from another is the service offered. The restaurants’ owners insist on hiring highly qualified management with significant experience in managing such organizations.

40|$|Europe has for a {{long time}} paid the great {{attention}} on the protection of the rights and interests of consumers which is shown in the field of tourism through the development of a series of decrees and laws to strict regulations on the liability of travel business operator in order to achieve the protection on the interests and the rights of the travel consumers. No matter The International Convention about the Travel Contract in Brussels or the European uniform directive on the tourism, all of them have focused on making the liability of travel business operator specific and strict, and its prominent feature is that the package travel organizers of the package travel contract need not only to be responsible for the whole package travel product but also need to be charge of various single tourism services composed of the package tourism products no matter whether it is provided by the package travel organizers. The package travel organizers can no longer free themselves from the liability like before with the reason that he is not the providers of the tourism service. So this can be seen as to conduct a comprehensive basis for the protection the rights and interests of tourism consumers and this spirit has been accepted by the EU member states in the following procession to adjust their national laws in accordance with EU directive. With this starting point it gradually forms a relatively complete system of the liability of the package travel organizers through the ways such as the enactment of tourism law and accordingly added to a large number of lega l norms to adjust the liability of the package travel organizers in the travel law and civil law. Although the individ ual EU member States develop their national travel laws in different patterns, but their starting point is the same - to provide a legal basis {{for the protection of the}} rights and interests of the travel consumer and constantly improve it. With regards to the level of protection has not been limited to the provided package tourism product itself; it also includes the ultimate goal of the package tour the spiritual enjoyment. Originally it was supported only in the judicial practice and later was incorpor ated into the formal legal provisions by some EU countries; today it has been accepted by more EU member states which expresses the advancement of the entire European region in the protection of the rights and interests of travel consumers and makes its l iability system of the package travel organizers in the forefront of the world. Therefore, tracing the source of the European region in the first part is for the purpose to find the reasons and methods for China to learn from it well. Many countries and regions in Asia have inser ted the Europe's successful experience and theoretical learning into their own construction of the liability regime of package travel organizers. They are engaged in the practice of the different legislative mode and content of the EU countries according to the characteristics themselves. Japan learning the model of French to develop their own independent travel Basic Law to adjust the liability of the package travel organizers, China's Taiwan region in accordance with the German model set up a chapter about the travel contract in the civil law to regulate the liability of the package travel organizers, and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China has also kept the case law model of British. Although they are different in the content and model, but they all find their own suitable patterns with the integration of its own characteristics forming their unique style in the course of learning and drawing on the European advanced theories. The detailed discussion about the construction of the liability system of the package travel organizers of these Asian countries in the second part is for the purpose of exploring the absorbing process of these Asian countries and then gives rise to the thought: How can China find the appropriate model of their own country to form its liability system of the package travel organizers in learning and drawing on the European experience. China's tourism industry developed rapidly after the reform and opening-up of 1978, but the problems associa ted with the development of tourism has gradually become apparent in tourism activity, in particular, the issue of the infringement of the legitimate rights and interests of tourists has bee paid attention by a vast number of legislators. Because the relevant laws and regulations in China are very imperfect, China has no travel Basic Law adjusting the liability of the package travel organizers, and in contract law, the travel contract is still taken as a nameless contract, and it can only be applicable to the genera l principles of Civil Law, Contract Law, and Consumer Protection law which leads to the court often make different decisions under the different legal basis for the same or similar cases about the travel contract and which makes the interests rights of tourists can not be protected reasonably and effectively and seriously impede the healthy development of the tourism industry. Therefore, the third part of the article is mainly from two aspects, theory and practice, to discuss China's current legislative status and shortcomings and the breakthrough of judicial practice for the laws about the liability system of the package travel organizers. The study on the liability system of the package travel organizers has {{for a long}} time been a rather weak area in the domestic legal research. It is not coordinate with the booming tourism market of China and is not incompatible with an orderly, sound and legal environment after China enters into the WTO under the international standards. Speeding up the construction of the liability system of the package travel organizers in China is not only related to the healthy development of the entire tourism industry, but also affects the protection of the rights and interests of the entire consumer groups. So it plays an important role in socio-economic development of China. In all, the advanced theories and models of the Europe, particularly Italy as well as the learning process in various Asian countries has given us a good example. China has developed into a big <b>tourism</b> <b>country,</b> because tourism becomes an integral part of Chinese living, the various relationships causes by tourism have been throughout the whole of society, the tourism legislation should be a social legislation and its adjustment scope is the entire community, rather than a particular industry, therefore, in order to regulate the liability of the package travel organizers, we must firstly establish a sound tourism legislative system in China and at the same time we must also see that China has its own historical and cultural traditions. In such background how to find a model suitable for China is still firstly considered in the tourism legislation. But anyway, the protection of the rights and interests of tourism consumers and the protection of the rights and interests of consumers as a whole is our persistent goal...|$|E
