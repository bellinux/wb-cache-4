25|$|Giant, segmented, insect-like, {{antennae}} {{rise over}} a distant mountain range. There is no direct {{connection between the}} antennae and the aliens, but the newly discovered race is named Ark Megaforms. The demonstration of the antennae {{appears to be an}} act of intimidation. It soon becomes apparent that Ark Megaforms want the humans to leave the planet as soon as possible. The Megaforms use the Kid as their negotiator with the humans. The Kid visits the base of ER-2 several times. He allows the humans <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him</b> and question him about his foster parents in exchange for the promise to leave. The communication does not proceed smoothly as the Kid exhibits the mixture of human and alien psychological traits. His very way of thought seems inconceivable to humans. Though he can speak, most of the questions he is either unable or unwilling to answer. Moreover, there is a conflict of interest as the humans want to find out about Ark Megaforms as much as possible while the Kid just wants them to leave.|$|E
2500|$|He [...] had {{a little}} Wild West {{aggregation}} that visited the camps and did a tremendous business. I did some roping and riding, and Jack, {{who was one of}} the smartest showmen I ever knew, took a great interest in me. It was he who gave me the idea for my original stage act with my pony. I learned a lot about the show business from him. He could do a bum act with a rope that an ordinary man couldn't get away with, and make the audience think it was great, so I used <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him</b> by the hour, and from him I learned the great secret of the show business—knowing when to get off. It's the fellow who knows when to quit that the audience wants more of.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Fallout", Claire's father reveals {{that he knew}} about her powers long before {{she was aware of}} them. He {{acknowledges}} doing things he was not proud of to keep her safe, and tells Claire that Sylar had been taken care of, but that she must keep silent about her powers because she is in danger from others like him. Bennet later meets with Sylar, confined in a prison cell, and tells him that the cell is keeping his powers suppressed. Sylar taunts Bennet telling him that Bennet is just like him. [...] In their next confrontation Bennet turns the taunt back at Sylar telling him how they plan <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him</b> to determine what makes him [...] "tick." [...] Sylar boasts that he would escape and kill Claire, taking her healing abilities. Eden suggests using her powers to persuade Sylar to kill himself, but Bennet declines (though briefly tempted), as he takes orders from someone higher up. Bennet later takes Claire to the police station, where she is interviewed about Jackie's murder. Officer Parkman is unable to read the thoughts of Claire or her father, since the Haitian is hiding behind a nearby corner. Afterwards, Bennet orders the Haitian to wipe the memories of his son and Claire's friend, Zach. [...] When Claire finds out {{that the two of them}} have lost all memory of her powers she rings her father in a panic. [...] It is left open whether it is only then that he orders the Haitian to wipe Claire's memories or whether he has already done so.|$|E
50|$|A Paris society, Les Amis de Louis Pergaud, {{is devoted}} <b>to</b> <b>study</b> of <b>him</b> and his works.|$|R
50|$|Türünz is {{considered}} a master oud-maker, and has people travel from countries such as Palestine <b>to</b> <b>study</b> with <b>him.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 2001 - Invitation by Plácido Domingo <b>to</b> <b>study</b> with <b>him,</b> {{after hearing}} his voice at [...] "Prayer for America." ...|$|R
60|$|As for {{the third}} man, I took no pains <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him,</b> for I saw at once that he was nothing but an interpreter.|$|E
60|$|Dag Daughtry chuckled to himself, as Michael, advancing, sniffed his trousers' legs {{long and}} earnestly. And the man took {{advantage}} of his nearness <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him</b> some more, lighting his pipe and running over the dog's excellent lines.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} was wise. I don't expect to get much out of the man except an interview, with a chance <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him</b> at close range. Also I'm anxious to see what that mysterious office looks like." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1813, Hamilton {{completed}} his {{catalogue of the}} Bibliothèque Nationale manuscripts. Following {{the end of the}} Napoleonic wars many German scholars came <b>to</b> <b>study</b> with <b>him,</b> notably Franz Bopp, Othmar Frank and August Wilhelm Schlegel.|$|R
50|$|When Master Dong retired, Yin {{took over}} as the {{supervisor}} of the security guards, working for the emperor in the Forbidden City. The Empress Dowager liked his skill and even wanted <b>to</b> <b>study</b> with <b>him.</b>|$|R
25|$|James McKeen Cattell, {{a student}} of Wilhelm Wundt who had been reading Galton's articles, decided he wanted <b>to</b> <b>study</b> under <b>him.</b> He {{eventually}} built a professional relationship with Galton, measuring subjects and working together on research.|$|R
6000|$|... “Wait a minute,” said Patsy, {{and ran up}} to her room, leaving Beth {{to confront}} the ranchero and <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him</b> with her dark, clear eyes. But she said nothing until her cousin {{returned}} and thrust a small kodak print into Miguel’s hand.|$|E
60|$|Every one {{who knows}} the philosophic {{writings}} of Mr. John Stuart Mill, will be familiar with this opinion. But {{to those who have}} no leisure <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him,</b> I should recommend the reading of Professor Huxley's third lecture on the origin of species.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was visiting}} {{him at this}} place to shoot and fish. A part of my purpose, however, was <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him,</b> and his odd, solitary way of life. He seemed a good model for a {{character}} in fiction. I sometimes write stories." ...|$|E
60|$|The dark {{young lady}} {{had never taken}} her dark eyes off him, but seemed <b>to</b> be <b>studying</b> <b>him</b> with almost tragic exactitude. At {{the end of her}} {{scrutiny}} she had something like the shadow of a smile, and she sat down in a chair.|$|R
50|$|Herkner was {{originally}} a Marxist who later evolved towards realist views. Alexandra Kollontai went <b>to</b> Zürich <b>to</b> <b>study</b> under <b>him,</b> but {{found he had}} become a “revisionist” and spent much of her time at the university contesting his views.|$|R
50|$|In 1959, Ip Man is {{settling}} into his low-profile life in Hong Kong. His elder son, Ip Chun, has returned <b>to</b> Foshan <b>to</b> <b>study,</b> leaving <b>him</b> with his younger son Ip Ching {{and his wife}} Cheung Wing-sing in Hong Kong.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would like}} to know," [...] she said, [...] "what cause there could {{possibly}} be for your wanting to become acquainted {{with a man who}} had been engaged to the lady you wished to marry, if you didn't intend <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him</b> up, and try to do better yourself." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{this should}} justify his course {{we do not}} pretend. A good churchman in his place would have bethought him of his duty to the Master whose Vicar he was, and would have aimed at the sorely needed reform. But we are not {{concerned}} <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him</b> as a good churchman. It {{is by no means}} clear that we are concerned <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him</b> as a churchman at all. The Papacy had by this time become far less of an ecclesiastical than a political force; the weapons of the Church were there, but they were being employed for the furtherance not of churchly, but of worldly aims. If the Pontiffs in the pages of this history remembered or evoked their spiritual authority, it was but to employ it as an instrument for the advancement of their temporal schemes. And personal considerations entered largely into these.|$|E
60|$|Mary {{was aware}} that some {{sinister}} change had come over him, and she paused <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him</b> keenly. The tremulous quality of his voice and action had passed away. He was hard, stern, self-contained, and she (without being a coquette) determined that his mood should give way to hers. He set himself hard against the charm of her lovely presence and the dainty room. Mary ceased to smile, but her brows remained level.|$|E
50|$|At age 18 Schiffmann sent a {{handwritten}} letter to Krishnamurti and was accepted <b>to</b> <b>study</b> with <b>him</b> in Brockwood Park, England. He deepened his practice of yoga with Desikachar and Iyengar in India, and with Dona Holleman and Vanda Scaravelli in Europe.|$|R
50|$|Enrique el Cojo {{taught for}} many years in a small studio on the side street, Espiritu Santo. Among his {{students}} were the famous dancers Lola Flores, Cristina Hoyos, and Manuela Vargas. Students came {{from as far away as}} Japan <b>to</b> <b>study</b> with <b>him.</b>|$|R
25|$|According {{to local}} {{tradition}} in modern Azamgarh, Durvasa's Ashram or hermitage, where many disciples used <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>study</b> under <b>him,</b> was {{situated in the}} area, at {{the confluence of the}} Tons River and Majhuee rivers, 6 km north of the Phulpur Tehsil headquarters.|$|R
60|$|At {{the time}} fixed in the morning, {{he went to}} the Occidental and was shown into a room where a number of gentlemen {{occupied}} a table. One or two were smoking and the others talked in low voices, but when Lister came in and the secretary indicated a chair they turned as if <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him.</b> Duveen sat next a man {{at the end of the}} table and gave Lister a nod. Somehow Lister thought he was amused.|$|E
6000|$|The mirth of {{the little}} party, however, came to a sudden pause as they met the minister. Mara clung tight to the Captain's neck, and looked out slyly under her curls. But the little Moses made a step forward, and fixed his bold, dark, {{inquisitive}} eyes upon him. The fact was, that the minister had been impressed upon the boy, in his few visits to the [...] "meeting," [...] as such a grand and mysterious reason for good behavior, that he seemed resolved to embrace the first opportunity <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him</b> close at hand.|$|E
60|$|Such a philosopher, whom no prison can {{dispossess}} of {{his peace}} of mind, and whom no danger can deprive of his simple pleasures, deserves more consideration than the naturalists have ever given him. I resolved {{on the spot}} <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him</b> more carefully. As if to discourage all such attempts and make himself a target for my rifle, he nearly spoiled my canoe the next night by gnawing a hole through the bark and ribs for some suggestion of salt that only his greedy nose could possibly have found.|$|E
50|$|The phenomenal {{success of}} some of his pupils, such as Jan Kubelík, Jaroslav Kocián, Efrem Zimbalist, Juan Manén, Marie Hall, Victor Kolar and Erika Morini brought to him {{students}} {{from all parts of the}} world. Petrowitsch Bissing traveled from Hays, Kansas <b>to</b> <b>study</b> under <b>him.</b>|$|R
50|$|He had {{hundreds}} of students - learning kamancheh, setar, tar (lute), radif (Persian repertoire), Persian singing, Persian classical poetry - who came <b>to</b> <b>study</b> with <b>him</b> {{from all over the}} world. He also provided many opportunities for his students to meet and work with other masters of Persian music.|$|R
50|$|During this time, Honey {{also earned}} a BA degree in Chinese. He became a {{valuable}} source {{of knowledge about}} Southeast Asia and its cultures, languages, and politics. Many students from Australia and from the United States came <b>to</b> <b>study</b> with <b>him.</b> The British Foreign Office sought his advice about Vietnam.|$|R
60|$|The Yaqui was {{tenacious}} of life. He {{was still}} holding his own. For the first time Gale really looked at the Indian <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him.</b> He had a large head nobly cast, and a face that resembled a shrunken mask. It seemed chiseled in the dark-red, volcanic lava of his Sooner wilderness. The Indian's eyes were always black and mystic, but this Yaqui's encompassed all the tragic desolation of the desert. They were fixed on Gale, moved only when he moved. The Indian was short and broad, and his body showed unusual muscular development, although he seemed greatly emaciated from starvation or illness.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not even}} hear or see a tall young woman enter the church, clad in summer white, no, not when she was within five pace and, {{becoming}} suddenly aware of his presence, had stopped <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him</b> with the acutest interest. In a flash Isobel knew who he was. Of course he was much changed, for Godfrey, who had matured early, as those of his generation were apt to do, especially if they had led a varied life, was now a handsome and well-built {{young man with a}} fine, thoughtful face and a quite respectable moustache.|$|E
60|$|This {{confirmed}} Grahame's suspicion, {{and he felt}} uneasy. He did {{not want}} Gomez <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>him,</b> {{and he would not}} have come in to dinner only that he must warn Sarmiento. If he and his friends were to succeed in their undertaking, their connection with Don Martin must remain unknown; for it would not be difficult to catch them landing arms should their object be suspected. He wondered where Macallister was, for the engineer could be trusted in an emergency, and presently he saw him coming in. There was no vacant place near Grahame, and Macallister sat down some distance off.|$|E
50|$|During {{his younger}} years, Owen showed promise as an {{aspiring}} classical pianist, winning a piano competition {{when he was}} 14 and attracting the attention of Solomon who invited Owen <b>to</b> <b>study</b> under <b>him.</b> After realising Owen's medical ambitions, Solomon urged Owen to choose to concentrate on either music or medicine.|$|R
50|$|He {{wrote in}} Arabic. He was most {{famous for his}} works of poetry than as a physician. He was also held in high esteem by his {{students}} who would travel <b>to</b> <b>study</b> with <b>him.</b> He was employed at 'Adud al-Dawla's dīwān. His approach to religion {{has been described as}} open-minded.|$|R
6000|$|... "Celia wants to. I shall go to college, so I don't mind. George {{is going}} to help the old {{minister}} here and see how he likes it. I'm <b>to</b> <b>study</b> with <b>him,</b> and if he is as pleasant as he used to be we shall have capital times,--see if we don't." ...|$|R
