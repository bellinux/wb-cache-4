5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>John</b> is {{significantly}} different from the synoptic gospels, with major variations in material, theological emphasis, chronology, and literary style. There are also some discrepancies between John and the synoptics, some amounting to contradictions.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{commonly}} {{understood as}} Gnostic, many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully argued that <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>John</b> has elements {{in common with}} Gnosticism. Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it. To say John's gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed to a level that required the author to respond to it. Bultmann, for example, argued that the opening theme of <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>John,</b> the pre-existing Logos, was actually a Gnostic theme. Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown {{have argued that the}} pre-existing Logos theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the Book of Proverbs, and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by Philo Judaeus.|$|E
5|$|According to Pentecostal biblical interpretation, <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>John</b> 20:22 {{shows that}} the disciples of Jesus were already born again before the Holy Spirit fell at Pentecost. They then cite biblical {{examples}} in the Book of Acts 2, 8, 10, and 19 {{to show that it}} was common in the New Testament for Spirit baptism to occur after conversion. In following the biblical pattern, they argue, Christians today should also pray for this baptism which results in greater power for ministry and witness.|$|E
5|$|All {{three letters}} of John were likely written {{within a few}} years of each other, and {{internal}} evidence indicates that they were written after <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>John,</b> placing them {{in the second half of}} the first century. This dating makes sense given their allusions and opposition to Gnostic and docetic teaching, which denied the full humanity of Jesus, and which was gaining ascendancy at the end of the first century.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>John</b> is anonymous, Christian {{tradition}} {{historically has}} attributed it to John the Apostle, son of Zebedee {{and one of}} Jesus' Twelve Apostles. The gospel is so closely related in style and content to the three surviving Johannine epistles that commentators treat the four books, along with the Book of Revelation, as a single corpus of Johannine literature, albeit not necessarily written by the same author.|$|E
5|$|As the Word, Jesus was {{eternally}} {{present with}} God, active in all creation, {{and the source}} of humanity's moral and spiritual nature. Jesus is not only greater than any past human prophet but greater than any prophet could be. He not only speaks God's Word; he is God's Word. In <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>John,</b> Jesus reveals his divine role publicly. Here he is the Bread of Life, the Light of the World, the True Vine and more.|$|E
5|$|The gospel {{has been}} {{depicted}} in live narrations and dramatized in productions, skits, plays, and Passion Plays, {{as well as}} in film.

5|$|The Third Epistle of John, often {{referred}} to as Third John and written 3 John, is the antepenultimate book of the New Testament and attributed to John the Evangelist, traditionally thought to be the author of <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>John</b> and the other two epistles of John. The Third Epistle of John is a private letter composed to a man named Gaius, recommending to him a group of Christians led by Demetrius, which had come to preach the gospel in the area where Gaius lived. The purpose of the letter is to encourage and strengthen Gaius, and to warn him against Diotrephes, who refuses to cooperate with the author of the letter.|$|E
5|$|Many modern {{scholars}} {{question the}} idea that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, seeing the biblical stories not as historical accounts but as symbolic narratives invented to present the birth as fulfillment of prophecy and imply {{a connection to the}} lineage of King David. The Gospel of Mark and <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>John</b> do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in Archaeology magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence of evidence for the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Galilee. In a 2011 article in Biblical Archaeology Review magazine, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor argues for the traditional position that Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The extant book {{contains}} preliminary matter, {{the complete}} {{text of the}} Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, and <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>John</b> through John 17:13. The remainder of John and an unknown amount of the preliminary matter is missing and was perhaps lost when the book was stolen early in the 11th century. The remaining preliminary matter consists of two fragmentary lists of Hebrew names contained in the Gospels, Breves causae (Gospel summaries), Argumenta (short biographies of the Evangelists), and Eusebian canon tables. It is probable that, like the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Books of Durrow and Armagh, part of the lost preliminary material included the letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus I beginning Novum opus, in which Jerome explains the purpose of his translation. It is also possible, though less likely, that the lost material included the letter of Eusebius to Carpianus, in which he explains {{the use of the}} canon tables. Of all the insular Gospels, only the Lindisfarne manuscript contains this letter.|$|E

25|$|The three Synoptic Gospels {{refer to}} just one {{passover}} during his ministry, while <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>John</b> refers to three passovers, suggesting {{a period of about}} three years.
