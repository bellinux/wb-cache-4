Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for RASSF 1 A, TSLC 1, quantitative real-time PCR analysis of EBV DNA were performed on matched T, P, Z <b>tissues</b> (n = 28) as well as chronic nasopharyngitis <b>tissues</b> (n = 8). Hypermethylated RASSF 1 A was frequently detected in the T (82 %), P <b>tissues</b> (75 %), but less frequently in Z <b>tissues</b> (46 %). The average quantities of EBV DNA (copies/Î¼g DNA) in matched T, P, Z <b>tissues</b> were 673, 000, 90, 000, 7000.

5|$|Another study corroborated {{the latter}} study's results but found {{the growth rate}} to be much faster, finding it to be around 1800 {{kilograms}} (4000lbs). Although these results were much higher than previous estimations, the authors noted that these results significantly lowered the great difference between its actual growth rate and the one which would be expected of an animal of its size. The sudden change in growth rate {{at the end of}} the growth spurt may indicate physical maturity, a hypothesis which is supported by the discovery of medullary <b>tissue</b> in the femur of a 16 to 20-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex from Montana (MOR 1125, also known as B-rex). Medullary <b>tissue</b> is found only in female birds during ovulation, indicating that B-rex was of reproductive age. Further study indicates an age of 18 for this specimen. In 2016, it was finally confirmed by Mary Higby Schweitzer and Lindsay Zanno et al that the soft <b>tissue</b> within the femur of MOR 1125 was medullary <b>tissue.</b> This also confirmed the identity of the specimen as a female. The discovery of medullary bone <b>tissue</b> within Tyrannosaurus may prove valuable in determining the sex of other dinosaur species in future examinations, as the chemical makeup of medullary <b>tissue</b> is unmistakable.

5|$|Connective tissues are fibrous {{and made}} up of cells {{scattered}} among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix. Connective <b>tissue</b> gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective <b>tissue,</b> adipose <b>tissue,</b> fibrous connective <b>tissue,</b> cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, {{as well as in}} many of those less developed.|$|E

40|$|Effects of indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) on the {{mechanical}} properties of cell walls and structures of cell wall polysaccharides in outer and inner <b>tissues</b> of segments of dark grown squash (Cucurbita maxima Duch.) hypocotyls were investigated. IAA induced the elongation of unpeeled, intact segments, {{but had no}} effect on the elongation of peeled segments. IAA induced the cell wall loosening in outer <b>tissues</b> as studied by the stress-relaxation analysis but not in inner <b>tissues.</b> IAA-induced changes in the net sugar content of cell wall fractions in outer and inner <b>tissues</b> were very small. Extracted hemicellulosic xyloglucans derived from outer <b>tissues</b> had a molecular weight about two times as large as in inner <b>tissues,</b> and the molecular weight of xyloglucans in both outer and inner <b>tissues</b> decreased during incubation. IAA substantially accelerated the depolymerization of xyloglucans in outer <b>tissues,</b> while it prevented that in inner <b>tissues.</b> These results suggest that IAA-induced growth in intact segments is due to the cell wall loosening in outer <b>tissues,</b> and that IAA-accelerated depolymerization of hemicellulosic xyloglucans in outer <b>tissues</b> is involved in the cell wall loosening processes...|$|R

5|$|Exipulum is a {{term used}} to refer to the <b>tissue</b> or tissues {{containing}} the hymenium of an ascomycete fruit body. The ectal excipulum (outer <b>tissue</b> layer) is thin (20â30Âµm thickness), made of a <b>tissue</b> type known as texura porrecta, consisting of more or less parallel hyphae all in one direction, with wide lumina and non-thickened walls. The medullary exipulum (middle <b>tissue</b> layer) is thick (200â600Âµm) and made of textura intricata, a <b>tissue</b> layer made of irregularly interwoven hyphae with distinct spaces between the hyphae. The asci (filamentous structures in which the ascospores develop) are cylindrical with gradually tapering bases, eight-spored, and measure 240â280 by 12â15Âµm. The ascospores have ellipsoidal to roughly cylindrical shapes, usually with blunt ends, and measure 19â22 by 10â12Âµm. They have smooth surfaces and usually contain two large oil drops. The paraphyses (sterile, filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium) are cylindrical, 2â3Âµm thick, barely enlarged at their apices, straight, and mostly unbranched above. They may sometimes anastomose, but do not form a conspicuous network. The paraphyses contain numerous red granules.|$|E

Although primo <b>tissues</b> have been observed in various <b>tissues</b> isolated {{from a number of}} animal species, including mice, rats, and rabbits, very few reports on the histological characteristics of primo <b>tissues</b> from different body parts are available. This study was designed to compare the histological characteristics of primo <b>tissues</b> isolated from different body parts of rats. Methods: Rats were anesthetized and operated on, to locate primo <b>tissues.</b> The primo <b>tissues</b> were searched at the all organsâ surface and in lymphatic vessels using suitable finding methods.

Moreover, primo <b>tissues</b> could be differentiated from those with a similar structure, such as lymphatic vessels and blood vessels, by immunostaining against a-LYVE- 1 and a-CD 31, and can be observed by specific immunostaining against the Von Willebrand factor (vWF).

5|$|If {{granulation}} <b>tissue</b> grows {{over the}} injured site, {{it can cause}} stenosis of the airway, after a week to a month. The granulation <b>tissue</b> must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung <b>tissue</b> distal to a completely obstructed bronchiole often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this <b>tissue</b> remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially obstructed bronchiole. Infected lung <b>tissue</b> distal to a stricture can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause bronchiectasis, in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of lung function may be permanent.|$|E
