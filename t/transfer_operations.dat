25|$|Inside ISS, around 12:00 UTC a {{false smoke}} and fire alarm {{triggered}} by the Japanese Kibo laboratory sounded for about 4 minutes. Mission Control in Houston concluded that stirred up dust particles due to <b>transfer</b> <b>operations</b> aboard the station might have sounded the alarm. This was the third false station alarm during the STS-129 mission. The two previous alarms originated in the new Russian Poisk module.|$|E

25|$|The {{crew had}} {{some help from}} the station crew of Andrey Borisenko, Sergei Volkov and Satoshi Furukawa in the <b>transfer</b> <b>operations.</b> Crew members also opened the Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA-3), {{attached}} to the Tranquility node, and stored some of the material from Raffaello there. Station lead flight director Chris Edelen said at an afternoon briefing that about 50% of the cargo had been moved from Raffaello and the shuttle's middeck to the space station.|$|E
25|$|The two crews {{continued}} <b>transfer</b> <b>operations,</b> and Finke and Pettit {{worked together}} to reconfigure the Urine Processing Assembly (UPA) to try to dampen any vibration that may be contributing to the unit's shutting down prematurely. The unit has continued to operate sporadically, shutting itself down after {{two to three hours}} of operations, and the engineers on the ground are still evaluating the possible causes and solutions. Managers on the ground would make a decision Monday on whether to extend Endeavours mission by one docked day, to help with the troubleshooting of the Water Recovery System (WRS). The Endeavour crew had several hours of off-duty time, and participated in media interviews.|$|E
25|$|The Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981 {{compelled}} Conrail to <b>transfer</b> <b>operations</b> of all passenger and commuter {{services to}} local transit authorities, resulting in Conrail ceasing all subsidized passenger rail services. B won the {{contract for the}} southside lines; for the first time, all Boston commuter service was operated by one entity. After bankruptcy, B continued to operate trains {{under the protection of}} the federal bankruptcy court, in the hopes that a reorganization could make it profitable again. It emerged from the court's protection when Timothy Mellon's Guilford Transportation Industries (GTI) bought it in 1983. GTI let the contract expire in 1987, after a bitter strike had shut down most of the northside lines in 1986.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the effect of transfer of genes for bacterial evolutionary algorithm. The bacterial operation in the Pseudo-Bacterial Genetic Algorithm (PBGA) is efficient in improving local portions of chromosomes. In the experiments presented in this paper a gene <b>transfer</b> <b>operation</b> is introduced in the place of the crossover operation in the PBGA. The gene <b>transfer</b> <b>operation</b> allows the chromosomes to directly transfer information to the other counterparts in the population. The gene transfer is inspired by the phenomenon of transfer of strands of genes between bacteria that occurs in nature. By means of this mechanism, one bacterium can rapidly spread its genetic information to other cells. Numerical experiments were performed to show the effectiveness of the PBGA with the gene <b>transfer</b> <b>operation.</b> The obtained results show the benefits that can be obtained with the newly introduced operation. 1. Introduction Genetic Algorithms (GA) represent a class of optimization te [...] ...|$|R
25|$|On the station, {{the crews}} {{continued}} to work on <b>transfer</b> <b>operations,</b> and continued work on the water reclamation system. During the Mission Status Briefing, lead ISS Flight Director Ginger Kerrick noted that a sample {{was taken from the}} Water Processor Assembly that contained 10% urine and 90% condensate, and would be returned to the ground with the shuttle. Kerrick noted that if activation of the system continued on schedule, a sample from the potable water dispenser would be taken on flight day eleven. The ground crew continued to troubleshoot the Urine Processor Assembly, looking at whether there is a sensor touching part of the system’s centrifuge as it rotates, which might be causing it to slow down.|$|E
25|$|Flight day six {{was devoted}} to <b>transfer</b> <b>operations,</b> and the two crews worked through the morning to {{complete}} all the rack transfers. Magnus and Chamitoff successfully installed the two crew quarters racks into the Harmony node, and installed a rack with equipment {{to be returned to}} Earth into the MPLM. During the Mission Status briefing, Lead ISS Flight Director Ginger Kerrick noted that all the racks were now on station, and about 25% of the cargo transfers had been completed, which was slightly ahead of schedule. The two crews also began working on activating the Water Recovery System, so that samples of water from two areas could be taken and returned to Earth with Endeavour. The system's initial checkout was initiated, and water samples would be taken after several days of operation. Later in the day, the two crews reviewed procedures for the mission's second EVA, and Stefanyshyn-Piper and Kimbrough would sleep in the station's airlock as part of the pre-EVA campout procedure.|$|E
2500|$|On flight day 11 the MPLM Leonardos hatches {{were closed}} at 07:38 UTC (03:38 EDT) and the MPLM was unberthed from the nadir or earth facing port of the Harmony node at 20:24 UTC (16:24 EDT). It {{was placed in}} a low hover, about [...] above shuttle Discoverys payload bay. This was done because the MPLM was unberthed from Harmony later than planned. The delay in {{unberthing}} was caused by a set of bolts on the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) getting stuck due to a broken pin. The crew will finish putting Leonardo in the payload bay on flight day 12, prior to the docked late inspection. The crews conducted some <b>transfer</b> <b>operations</b> between the ISS and shuttle mid-deck, which brings the overall <b>transfer</b> <b>operations</b> to ninety-four percent complete for the mission.|$|E
