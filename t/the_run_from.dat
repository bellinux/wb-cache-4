Pursuing her, Kisuke fights both Torahime and undead soldiers loyal to her family.

Dying from his wounds, the spirit of Senju Oboroya, the creator of the Oboro Style that controls the Demon Blades, fused with Kisuke to save his life and pass on the Oboro Style to someone who would use it for good.
