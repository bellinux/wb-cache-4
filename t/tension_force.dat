5|$|Tension {{forces can}} be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be {{combined}} with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object {{is accompanied by a}} force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object {{through the use of a}} set-up that uses movable pulleys, the <b>tension</b> <b>force</b> on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the <b>tension</b> <b>force</b> in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.|$|E
5|$|Crystalline solids {{cohesion}} {{is obtained}} by a metallic or chemical bond which is formed between the constituent atoms. Chemical bonds can be grouped into two types consisting of ionic and covalent. To form an ionic bond, either a valence or bonding electron separates from one atom and becomes attached to another atom to form oppositely charged ions. The bonding in the static position {{is when the}} ions occupy an equilibrium position where the resulting force between them is zero. When the ions are exerted in <b>tension</b> <b>force,</b> the inter-ionic spacing increases creating an electrostatic attractive force, while a repulsing force under compressive force between the atomic nuclei is dominant.|$|E

A mathematical model has been developed to account for convec-tion and temperature distributions in sta-tionary arc w eld pools driven by buoyan-cy, electromagnetic and surface <b>tension</b> <b>forces.</b> It is shown that the electromag-netic and surface <b>tension</b> <b>forces</b> domi-nate the flow behavior.

2500|$|The {{classical}} {{theory of}} contact {{focused primarily on}} non-adhesive contact where no <b>tension</b> <b>force</b> is allowed to occur within the contact area, i.e., contacting bodies can be separated without adhesion forces. [...] Several analytical and numerical approaches {{have been used to}} solve contact problems that satisfy the no-adhesion condition. [...] Complex forces and moments are transmitted between the bodies where they touch, so problems in contact mechanics can become quite sophisticated. [...] In addition, the contact stresses are usually a nonlinear function of the deformation. [...] To simplify the solution procedure, a frame of reference is usually defined in which the objects (possibly in motion relative to one another) are static. They interact through surface tractions (or pressures/stresses) at their interface.|$|E
