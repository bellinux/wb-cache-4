5|$|Brezhnev was {{adept at}} the {{politics}} within the Soviet power structure. He {{was a team}} player and never acted rashly or hastily; unlike Khrushchev, he did not make decisions without substantial consultation from his colleagues, and was always willing <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> opinions. During the early 1970s, Brezhnev consolidated his domestic position. In 1977, he forced the retirement of Podgorny and became once again Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, making this position equivalent to that of an executive president. While Kosygin remained Premier until {{shortly before his death}} in 1980 (replaced by Nikolai Tikhonov as Premier), Brezhnev was the dominant driving force of the Soviet Union from the mid-1970s to his death in 1982.|$|E
5|$|In Islam: The Untold Story, Holland {{deals with}} {{the origins of the}} {{religion}} Islam. Travelling to Saudi Arabia, he visits Arabian Bedouins <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> orthodox Islamic accounts of the religion's origins. Holland then talks to Seyyed Hossein Nasr, a practising Muslim who teaches Islamic studies at the George Washington University, Washington D.C., and Patricia Crone, a non-Muslim historian of Islamic history at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. The former defends the orthodox Islamic account of the faith's history, citing its development within oral history, but Crone challenges the reliability of oral history, and therefore the traditional account.|$|E
5|$|Jharokha Darshan was a daily {{practice}} {{of addressing the}} public audience (darshan) at the balcony (jharokha) at the forts and palaces of medieval kings in India. It was an essential and direct way of communicating face-to-face with the public, and was a practice which {{was adopted by the}} Mughal emperors. The balcony appearance in the name of Jharokha Darshan also spelled jharokha-i darshan was adopted by the 16th-century Mughal Emperor Akbar, even though it was contrary to Islamic injunctions. Earlier, Akbar's father Emperor Humayun had also adopted this Hindu {{practice of}} appearing before his subjects at the jharokha <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> public grievances.|$|E
5000|$|Buck is {{generally}} regarded as [...] "one of the most heavily criticized" [...] announcers in sports, with various fans complaining that he is biased on his calls towards or against particular teams. Buck attributes this {{to the fact that}} most fan bases, especially Major League Baseball fans, are used <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> local announcers and not those working national broadcasts: [...] "Fans are used <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>their</b> hometown guys. When you come at it objectively, people aren't used to it." ...|$|R

5|$|On June 24, 1832, {{a supply}} wagon loaded with meat and lead bars from Galena arrived at Apple River Fort around noon. Around this time, Black Hawk and his 200-man war party also {{en route to}} the fort, had {{gathered}} at a gap in Terrapin Ridge. Black Hawk's forces were able to elude detection until the time they opened fire. At around 4 p.m. four couriers from Galena bound for the army camp at Dixon's Ferry arrived at the fort. The fort's occupants were eager <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> news from Galena and of the conflict with Black Hawk.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} days of the shutdown, many {{programs}} requested that their funding continue, especially social service organizations that relied on state funding. <b>To</b> <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> pleas, the courts appointed retired State Supreme Court judge Kathleen Blatz as a special master. Dayton and State Attorney General Lori Swanson also both submitted petitions to the Ramsey County District Court when the shutdown began, asking for the court to clarify whether some programs could continue. Judges Kathleen Gearin and Bruce W. Christopherson issued their rulings on July 7, finding that some programs could start again, including criminal background checks, public schools, and local government aid. Gearin complained that the governor and legislature should have been responsible for making decisions about which services could stay open. Gearin had previously heard a case from the Minnesota Zoo, which asked to remain open despite the shutdown, and another from the Canterbury Park horse racing track in Shakopee. While both pay for themselves at least during the summer, Gearin determined that only the Zoo was allowed to operate without legislative appropriations, so she allowed the Zoo to open on July 2 but ordered Canterbury Park to remain closed the same day.|$|E

25|$|Cubans {{have never}} been content <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> music {{described}} as salsa, {{even though it is}} crystal clear that this was a label for their music. Since the early 1990s Timba has been used to describe popular dance music in Cuba, rivaled only lately by Reggaetón. Though derived from the same roots as salsa, Timba has its own characteristics, and is intimately tied to the life and culture of Cuba, and especially Havana.|$|E

The informateur then reports to the King and advises him about the appointment of a formateur. However, the King can also decide to appoint a second informateur or appoint a royal mediator.|$|E
25|$|A {{party that}} is aggrieved by a {{decision}} of the NLRB can seek review by petitioning in the Court of Appeals.

The NLRB, as a matter of policy, only petitions in the Circuit in which the hearing was held.|$|E
25|$|The judge {{consequently}} postponed {{the next}} hearing until December 2011, as the prosecution requested a new {{assessment of the}} book {{by a panel of}} three professors of Kemerovo State University, including linguist Michael Osadchy, psychologist Sergei Dranishnikov, and religious studies expert Alexei Gorbatov. They were divided on the issue: two found signs of extremism in the text and one did not. Following a plea by ISKCON advocate Mikhail Fralov to seek a statement of the Russian Human Rights Committee on the Bhagavad Gita As It Is and on the right of religious minorities, the Judge agreed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> opinion and postponed the final verdict until December 28, 2011.|$|E

25|$|Aged 14, Khalid bin Abdulaziz {{was sent}} by King Abdulaziz as his {{representative}} to the desert tribes <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> concerns and problems. In 1932, Prince Khalid was named as viceroy of the Hejaz, replacing Prince Faisal in the post, who was named minister of foreign affairs. Prince Khalid's term as viceroy of Hejaz lasted until 1934. Prince Khalid joined the Saudi army led by his older brother Prince Faisal and fought against Yemeni forces in 1934. After the war, Prince Khalid served {{as the chairman of}} the Saudi delegation at the Taif Conference with Yemen in 1934. This was a diplomatic move that led to the Taif Treaty later that year.|$|E
25|$|The {{cocktail}} party effect is the phenomenon {{that a person}} hears his or her name even when not attending to the conversation. To study this, a screening measure for attentional control was given that tested a person’s ability {{to keep track of}} words while also doing math problems. Participants were separated into two groups---low and high span attentional control ability groups. They listened to two word lists read simultaneously by a male and a female voice and were told to ignore the male voice. Their name was read by the “ignored” male voice. Low span people were more likely <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> name compared to high span people. This result suggests that people with lower attentional control ability have more trouble inhibiting information from the surrounding environment.|$|E
25|$|The band's {{personal}} {{goal for}} Documentaly was to achieve 100,000 copies sold {{and to be}} able to perform at the 9,000-capacity Makuhari Messe event hall. After achieving this goal, Sakanaction decided to extend this goal for their next album: 200,000 copies sold and two days performing at the Makuhari Messe. In order for the band to meet this goal, they realized they would need to reach out to a much wider audience, by agreeing to more commercial tie-ups, which they saw as a challenge for the band to do new things. Furthermore, they felt that they would need to consider a new audience: people with no prior interest in the band, who would happen <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> music as they watched television, as well as a younger audience.|$|E

25|$|Killer {{whales are}} able to capture both young and adult belugas. They live in all the seas {{of the world and}} share the same habitat as belugas in the sub-Arctic region. Attacks on belugas by killer whales have been {{reported}} in the waters of Greenland, Russia, Canada, and Alaska. A number of killings have been recorded in Cook Inlet, and experts are concerned the predation by killer whales will impede the recovery of this subpopulation, which has already been badly depleted by hunting. The killer whales arrive at the beginning of August, but the belugas are occasionally able <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> presence and evade them. The groups near to or under the sea ice have a degree of protection, as the killer whale's large dorsal fin, up to 2 m in length, impedes their movement under the ice and does not allow them to get sufficiently close to the breathing holes in the ice.|$|E
25|$|During {{the same}} decade she was legal advisor to and a {{founding}} member of the Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform. She left this position in 1979 to join RTÉ as a journalist and presenter during one period as a reporter and presenter for their Today Tonight programme. However, in RTÉ she and Alex White (then TV producer and now Labour Party TD) were attacked and criticised by a group led by Eoghan Harris associated with the Workers' Party over what they perceived as her bias towards Republican groups in the North. McAleese was critical of the Provisional IRA but believed it was important <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> side of the story; she opposed the Harris faction's support for Section 31 which she believed was an attack on free speech. In 1981, she returned to the Reid Professorship, but continued to work part-time for RTÉ for a further four years. In 1987, she returned to Queen's University to become Director of the Institute of Professional Legal Studies. She stood, unsuccessfully, as a Fianna Fáil candidate in the Dublin South-East constituency at the 1987 general election, receiving 2,243 votes (5.9%).|$|E
25|$|It is {{said that}} the city of Cholula has 365 churches, either one for {{each day of the}} year or one for each pre-Hispanic temple that used to be there. In reality, there are only thirty seven churches; 159, if all the small chapels {{including}} those on local haciendas and ranches are counted. One legend states that the first chapel to be built in Cholula was in the San Miguelito neighborhood on what is now the outskirts of the city. It was the first structure with a red tile roof, and it was dedicated to the Archangel Michael. It is said to have contained an image of the angel, which contained inside a small demon tied to a post. As people venerated the image of the archangel, they also acknowledged the demon, in case the angel decided not <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> pleas. This eventually gave the chapel an evil reputation as more came to ask for favors from the demon, favors that one would not ask of a saint or angel. The demon began to be blamed for misfortunes that befell in the area, as, the legend said, when they occurred, the demon image would be found untied. Eventually, the image of the archangel with the demon inside was taken away and eventually disappeared.|$|E
