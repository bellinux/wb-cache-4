25|$|His {{personal}} impact, however, was twofold: {{his image}} as a warm, gentle and kind man captivated the whole world. This image was immediately formed when he {{was presented to the}} crowd in St. Peter's Square following his election. <b>The</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> presence made him a much-loved figure before he even spoke a word. The media in particular fell under his spell. He was a very skilled orator.|$|E
500|$|James survived two conspiracies in {{the first}} year of his reign, despite the {{smoothness}} of the succession and <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> welcome: the Bye Plot and Main Plot, which led to the arrest of Lord Cobham and Sir Walter Raleigh, among others. Those hoping for a change in government from James were disappointed at first when he kept Elizabeth's Privy Councillors in office, as secretly planned with Cecil, but James soon added long-time supporter Henry Howard and his nephew Thomas Howard to the Privy Council, as well as five Scottish nobles.|$|E
500|$|Having {{returned}} {{to live in}} London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula's encouragement, became much more active socially and in pro bono publico activities. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music, and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the US once again, having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> reception. Kennedy describes it as [...] "like a musical state occasion".|$|E
60|$|John's eyes {{ran over}} her beauties, as with palpitating bosom and varying color she sat {{confused}} at <b>the</b> unusual <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> language and manner.|$|R
60|$|They walked home. Carol took Erik's arm. Through {{her thin}} linen sleeve {{she could feel}} <b>the</b> crumply <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{familiar}} brown jersey coat. She observed that there were purple and red gold threads interwoven with the brown. She remembered {{the first time she}} had seen it.|$|R

'They {{are good}} children, Sir Jasper, all of them, even the poor boy {{that is in}} trouble out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> heart; but 'tis Richard {{who would be the}} credit to you, if you would lend him the helping hand. Where is the boy, Kally?' ...|$|R
500|$|Descriptions of Farmer's playing style {{typically}} stress his lyricism and <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sound. The Los Angeles Times obituary writers {{noted that}} his playing had [...] "a sweetly lyrical tone and a melodic approach to phrasing, {{neither of which}} minimized his capacity to produce rhythmically swinging phrases". The equivalent comments in The Guardian were that [...] "Farmer avoided the bright, penetrating sound of orthodox trumpet playing and {{was influenced by the}} more reserved articulation of Miles Davis and Kenny Dorham", and that, although he could seem more restrained than Davis or Lee Morgan, [...] "Farmer was in his way a true original. His phrasing was always distinctive, letting the beat run ahead of him rather in the manner of Billie Holiday's vocals".|$|E
500|$|Large has {{commented that}} despite the colour and vigour of the music, there is little by way of characterisation, except {{in the cases of}} Kecal and, to a lesser extent, the loving pair and the unfortunate Vašek. The two sets of parents and the various circus folk are all {{conventional}} and [...] "penny-plain" [...] figures. In contrast, Kecal's character [...] that of a self-important, pig-headed, loquacious bungler [...] is instantly established by his rapid-patter music. Large suggests that the character may have been modelled on that of the boastful Baron in Cimarosa's opera Il matrimonio segreto. Mařenka's temperament is shown in vocal flourishes which include coloratura passages and sustained high notes, while Jeník's good nature is reflected in <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> music, generally in the G minor key. For Vašek's dual image, comic and pathetic, Smetana uses the major key to depict comedy, the minor for sorrow. Large suggests that Vašek's musical stammer, portrayed especially in his opening Act II song, was taken from Mozart's character Don Curzio in The Marriage of Figaro.|$|E

6000|$|For {{three days}} {{the two friends}} avoided each other, and then Prothero went to Benham's room. Benham was smoking cigarettes--Lady Marayne, in <b>the</b> first <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> filial devotion, had {{prohibited}} his pipe--and reading Webb's INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY. [...] "Hello!" [...] he said coldly, scarcely looking up, and continued to read that absorbing work.|$|R

6000|$|... "I am hurt;--I am hurt," [...] he continued. And she was {{surprised}} by <b>his</b> look <b>of</b> pain even more than by <b>the</b> unaccustomed <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> words.

60|$|Simon sped away; and the Prince, when {{left alone}} with Richard, put no {{restraint}} upon <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> feelings, and his tears fell fast and freely.|$|E
60|$|He {{took her}} hand in his, and bent his lips to it, and with <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> kiss upon it, she felt a {{moisture}} like a tear.|$|E
6000|$|He spoke, in <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> indignation, {{loud enough}} for Grace to hear him. [...] "What is there monstrous in it?" [...] she asked, {{advancing}} a step toward him, defiantly.|$|E
5000|$|Billy Dukes of Taste of Country {{gave the}} song a {{favorable}} review, writing that [...] "Young’s R&B influences {{come out in}} <b>the</b> sincerity and <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> delivery, not <b>the</b> sonic nature of this mostly acoustic jam." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{accordingly}} settled that Mr. Tupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass, {{should all}} wear fancy-dresses. Thus Mr. Pickwick {{was led by}} <b>the</b> very <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own good feelings to give his consent to a proceeding from which his better judgment would have recoiled--a more striking illustration <b>of</b> <b>his</b> amiable character {{could hardly have been}} conceived, even if the events recorded in these pages had been wholly imaginary.|$|R

The {{rest of the field}} was spread-eagled over several hours, some even having stopped for warm baths en route!" ...|$|R
60|$|His {{consciousness}} {{had quite}} returned ere an instant was over. He embraced her with <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> old affection, uttering many brief words of love, kindness, and tenderness, such as men speak when strongly moved.|$|E
60|$|All my old {{love for}} him reawakened. I wanted to say yes--to feel his strong arms about me, and <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> love enfolding and {{guarding}} me. In my weakness I yearned for his strength.|$|E
6000|$|... “That wouldn’t {{make it any}} easier. I’m not at {{all sure}} of that. But if so it can’t be a very idealistic sentiment. All <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> idealism is {{concentrated}} upon a certain ‘Américain, Catholique et gentil-homme. [...] . ’” ...|$|E
5000|$|The Persian {{text of the}} Tarikh-i-rashidi {{says that}} Mansur went so that by looking at her kind face his grief for the loss <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father might be mitigated. The Bible Society's Turk! version reads: [...] "Being {{prompted}} there to by <b>the</b> extreme <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> affection for her." [...] Both statements illumine her character. The second seems the more appropriate, {{since the death of}} Sultan Ahmad Khan took place in 1503 and Mansur's visit in 1520.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the midst}} of these warlike preparations, however, they {{received}} the chilling news that the colony of Massachusetts refused to back them in this righteous war. It seems that the gallant conduct of Peter Stuyvesant, <b>the</b> generous <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> vindication, and <b>the</b> chivalrous spirit <b>of</b> <b>his</b> defiance, though lost upon the grand council of the league, had carried conviction to the general court of Massachusetts, which nobly refused to believe him guilty of the villainous plot laid at his door.[43] ...|$|R

The previous two films had also been scripted or co-scripted by Thai writer Prabda Yoon. Chareon said he wanted Pen-Ek {{to return to his}} screenwriter-director roots and [...] "come up with a project that had <b>the</b> personal <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> early films like 6ixtynin9 and Monrak Transistor." ...|$|R
60|$|He put {{her inside}} his {{overcoat}} and his coat. She {{came to his}} warm breast with a sharp intaking of delight and fear; she tried to make her hands meet in <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoulders, tried to clasp him.|$|E
60|$|The {{first man}} he met {{shook hands with}} him in the most {{friendly}} manner, congratulating him upon the service he had done, and so did every one he saw, until he was absolutely astounded at <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> reception.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Lady Anna," [...] {{said the}} rector, as he offered her {{his arm to}} lead her out to dinner. It was but a mild {{corrective}} to <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nephew. The lord lingered a moment with his aunt in the library.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Arabin {{certainly}} did not go {{the right way to}} win such a woman as Eleanor Bold. Just as her wrath was evaporating, as it was disappearing before <b>the</b> true <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> untold love, he rekindled it by a most useless repetition <b>of</b> <b>his</b> original sin. Had he known what he was about, he should never have mentioned Mr. Slope's name before Eleanor Bold, till he had made her all his own. Then, and not till then, he might have talked of Mr. Slope with as much triumph as he chose.|$|R
60|$|The {{door was}} opened {{by a young}} man. His face at first wore the melancholy expression, almost despondency, of one who travels a wild and bleak road at nightfall and alone, but soon brightened up when he saw <b>the</b> kindly <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> reception. He felt his heart spring forward to meet them all, from the old woman who wiped a chair with her apron to the little child that held out its arms to him. One glance and smile placed the {{stranger}} on a footing of innocent familiarity with the eldest daughter.|$|R
60|$|Dawn {{broke and}} merged into day. It {{was cold and}} clear. Sixty below zero was Morganson's {{estimate}} of the frost. Not a breath stirred the chill Arctic quiet. He sat up suddenly, his muscular tensity increasing the hurt of the scurvy. He had heard the far sound of a man's voice and the faint whining of dogs. He began beating his hands back and forth against his sides. It was a serious matter to bare the trigger hand to sixty degrees below zero, and against that time he needed to develop all <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> which <b>his</b> flesh was capable.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{was lying}} in his arms, kept alive by <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> big, steady heart.

60|$|Brooks {{was shown}} {{into a private}} room at the Queen's Hotel, and he {{certainly}} had no cause to complain of <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> welcome. Lady Sybil, in fact, made room for him by her side, and he fancied {{that there was a}} gleam of reproach in her eyes as she looked up at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] I replied, feeling {{anything}} but comfortable. At {{times when he}} was facetious {{as he had been}} this morning I was wont to {{lose sight of the fact}} that with Farrar the manner was not the man, and to forget <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friendship. I was again to be reminded of this.|$|E
50|$|Binks in {{the title}} is an aside to the Star Wars CGI {{character}} who was poorly received, the title gives voice to the extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>his</b> negative critics had over the controversy raised by Binks' characterization {{and what it was}} felt to engender.|$|R
