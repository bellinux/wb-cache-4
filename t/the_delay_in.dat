5|$|Both Pavilions were {{scheduled}} to be unveiled on June 19, 2009. However, the Pavilion by Hadid endured construction delays and a construction team change, which led to nationwide coverage of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> publications such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Only its skeleton was availed to the public on the scheduled date, and the work was completed and unveiled on August 4, 2009.

5|$|By 1970 these {{differences}} {{had not been}} resolved, and Brezhnev postponed the 24th Party Congress and the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1971–1975). <b>The</b> <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> resolving these issues led to rumours circulating in Soviet society that Kosygin, or even Brezhnev, would lose their posts to Podgorny.

5|$|Following the 2005 {{purchase}} of the original Colross site by a real estate development company, an archaeological excavation was undertaken between March and June that year {{at the behest of}} the city of Alexandria. Archaeologists uncovered an underground domed brick cistern and evidence of slave outbuildings, in addition to the foundations of the estate's peripheral walls and several ancillary structures. The excavation of the Colross site resulted in 79 condominium buyers abandoning their purchase agreements because of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> construction of a luxury Monarch Condominium project.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{store their}} entire genomes {{in the form}} of RNA, and contain no DNA at all. Because they use RNA to store genes, their {{cellular}} hosts may synthesize their proteins as soon as they are infected and without <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> waiting for transcription. On the other hand, RNA retroviruses, such as HIV, require the reverse transcription of their genome from RNA into DNA before their proteins can be synthesized. RNA-mediated epigenetic inheritance has also been observed in plants and very rarely in animals.|$|E

5|$|After the Canadian {{government}} withdrew promised {{financial support}} for the expedition, <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> finding replacement funding ate into the Arctic sailing season. Shackleton, not wanting to delay departure any longer than he had to, decided to go south instead and attempt a circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent. The expedition, known as the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (John Rowett, {{an old friend of}} Shackleton's, was the main sponsor), would also attempt to discover sub-Antarctic islands and spend the southern winter in the Pacific islands. The expedition included several Endurance veterans in addition to Worsley; Frank Wild was again second in command, and Leonard Hussey was the meteorologist. Worsley was the master of the Quest, but would also be the expedition's hydrographer.|$|E
5|$|Australias keel {{was laid}} at John Brown & Company's Clydebank yard on 23 June 1910, and was {{assigned}} the yard number 402. The ship was launched by Lady Reid on 25 October 1911, {{in a ceremony}} which received extensive media coverage. Australias design was altered during construction to incorporate improvements in technology, including the newly developed nickel-steel armour plate. While it was intended that the entire ship be fitted with the new armour, manufacturing problems meant that older armour had {{to be used in}} some sections: <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> sourcing the older armour plates set construction back half a year. Despite this, John Brown & Company delivered the ship £295,000 under budget.|$|E
5|$|Between 1859 and 1860, Frewin Hall {{housed the}} future Edward VII whilst he {{attended}} Christ Church. The chapel and old kitchen were planned to {{form part of}} a new, third, quadrangle for Brasenose. The valuable rents that the shops {{on the south side}} of Brasenose earned the college provided the most significant reason for <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> further expansion, which only began in 1886 when work on the west side was started. It was finally completed in 1911, the last work having been done to the High Street frontage. Frewin Hall was reconstructed between 1887 and 1896, as were the chapel and antechapel. It had been in 1886 that Cradock had died and was replaced by Albert Watson.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{digital circuit}} {{can be viewed}} as a network of {{transistors}} switching between low and high voltages. These transistors and the wires interconnecting them cause <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> signal propagation. In most cases, designers aim to minimize <b>the</b> <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> order to increase processing speed. Nevertheless, some applications such as delay lines, time to digital converters, asynchronous logic and others require the ability to precisely control a delay between two points in a circuit. This paper proposes a novel way to control <b>the</b> <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> an FPGA by dynamically configuring the routing matrices to build a path with <b>the</b> required <b>delay</b> and to calibrate <b>the</b> <b>delays.</b> Such lowlevel configuration is possible with a dynamic reconfiguration library we developed for Xilinx FPGAs. Our experiments on Virtex-II Pro devices show that any differential <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> a range of 947 ps can be reached with a precision of +/- 18 ps. I...|$|R

5|$|Both pavilions were {{scheduled}} to be unveiled on June 19, 2009.

5|$|Both sides {{introduced}} new tactics, {{units and}} equipment based on Western models, but the Polish-Lithuanian forces proved more adept with these innovations than the Russians. However, the main factors {{that kept the}} Russians from winning were <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> moving siege artillery to Smolensk and the severe disruption of Russian supply lines by Polish cavalry. A scapegoat was nevertheless needed: Mikhail Shein was accused of treason and, together with his second-in-command Artemy Izmaylov and the latter's son Vasily, executed in Moscow on April 28, 1634. Learning from this defeat, the Russians would adopt new and more successful tactics in the Polish-Russian War (1654-1656).|$|E
5|$|First World {{commentators}} {{had already}} speculated that Brezhnev had {{died when he}} failed to sign a message of congratulations to José Eduardo dos Santos, the President of Angola, for the Angolan Independence Day.

Burns was a longtime friend of the Rothbard family and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building. It was only after Burns went on leave from the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors that Rothbard's thesis was accepted and he received his doctorate. Rothbard later stated that all of his fellow students there were extreme leftists and {{that he was one of}} only two Republicans on the Columbia campus at the time.|$|E
