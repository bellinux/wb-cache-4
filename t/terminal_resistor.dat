The fault of the fieldbus, in principle, comes from the physical layer, whose lay-out directly affects the fieldbus’s reliability.

The photodiode {{is connected to}} a part bias connection (9) for the supply with a blocking voltage. A bias connection (11) {{is connected to the}} resistor for controlling the potential at the signal output. The capacitor is provided for the high-frequency-technological earthing of the resistor. The capacitor lies between the bias connection and an earth line. The resistor is connected between the bias connection and the signal output. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for operating a photoreceiver. USE - Photoreceiver arrangement.

The antenna is composed of two pairs of Gaussian tapered slotline which have the same structure printed {{on both sides of}} the PCB, two metallic via arrays positioned along the slot edges, and two <b>terminal</b> <b>resistors.</b> The metallic via arrays are used to reduce the characteristic impedance of the conventional slotline which form a post-wall slotline and thus can be fed by a coaxial connector directly.

5000|$|To {{overcome}} {{the problems of}} these undesirable resistances (known as 'parasitic resistance'), very low value resistors and particularly precision resistors and high current ammeter shunts are constructed as four <b>terminal</b> <b>resistors.</b> These resistances have a pair of current terminals {{and a pair of}} potential or voltage terminals. In use, a current is passed between the current terminals, but the volt drop across the resistor is measured at the potential terminals.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the uniqueness of the solution of lossy lines with frequency-dependent parameters terminated with non-linear resistors. Several solutions that satisfy the same initial conditions may exist if the <b>terminal</b> <b>resistors</b> are locally active. In these cases the uniqueness of solution is assured adding parasitic capacitances in parallel to the voltage controlled resistors and parasitic inductances in series to the current controlled resistors. In this way, among all the possible solutions, the only one that assures the time continuity of the current and voltage waveforms at the ends of the line is captured. In the light of these results, the properties of numerical models of these distributed circuits based on convolution techniques have been studied, and conditions assuring the uniqueness of the numerical solution have been found. Numerical simulations, when based on qualitative information of this type, enable us to obtain the quantitative properties in an efficient manner.

In particular if the <b>terminal</b> multiport <b>resistors</b> are strictly locally passive, then the normal form exists and the solution is unique.

40|$|The work {{reported}} here {{has focused on}} the influence of substrate dissolution during the high temperature firing on the electrical properties of ruthenium dioxide-lead borosilicate thick film resistors. A resistor 25 (mu) m thick that is fired for 10 minutes at 840 (DEGREES) C will dissolve 4 (mu) m of the substrate surface. The presence of the alumina in the glass phase retards the growth of the resistor microstructure or chains of conducting particles by increasing the glass viscosity and slightly decreasing the solubility of RuO(, 2). These physical changes brought about measurable changes in the electrical properties. ^ Four glasses were made: a standard glass with 63 w/o PbO: 25 w/o B(, 2) O(, 3) : 12 w/o SiO(, 2); 4 w/o 614 AlSiMag substrate and 96 w/o standard glass; 6 w/o substrate and 94 w/o standard glass; 10 w/o substrate and 90 w/o standard glass. These glasses were powdered and mixed with 5 w/o RuO(, 2) powder then blended with screening agents. Four <b>terminal</b> <b>resistors</b> were fired onto 614 AlSiMag substrates under various conditions of time and temperature. The sheet resistance, hot (+ 125 (DEGREES) C) and cold (- 55 (DEGREES) C) temperature coefficients of resistance, normalized resistance versus temperature (- 55 to + 125 (DEGREES) C), and noise index were measured. As predicted, resistors with increasing amounts of substrate in the glass phase demonstrated slower development of electrical properties. It took about 14 minutes at 800 (DEGREES) C for a 10 w/o substrate resistor to reach its minimum sheet resistance compared to only 8 minutes for the standard glass resistor. ^ The hot and cold TCR 2 ̆ 7 s increased from large negative values (3 ̆c - 400 ppm/(DEGREES) C) for short firing times or low firing temperatures to near-zero values at longer firing times or higher firing temperatures. The noise index, in general, decreased with increasing firing time or temperature from about 40 dB down to 5 dB. With increasing weight percent substrate, the noise index increased. ^ A second group of experiments was performed to determine conduction mechanisms in thin films of the standard and 10 w/o substrate glasses. The glass was rf sputtered onto gold-coated, oxidized silicon wafers, then counter-electrodes of gold were evaporated on these films. Both ac and dc measurements were made. The parallel capacitance was a slowly decreasing function of frequency from 10 (2 ̆ 72) to 10 (2 ̆ 75) Hz. The conductivity increased linearly with frequency while the dissipation factor often showed a broad maximum implying the presence of an ionic impurity relaxation. The dielectric constants were found to be 11. 5 and 11. 2 for the standard and 10 w/o substrate glasses, respectively. The dielectric breakdown voltages were 2. 6 x 10 (2 ̆ 76) V/cm for the standard glass and 5. 5 x 10 (2 ̆ 76) V/cm for the 10 w/o substrate glass. The dc measurements indicate the conduction mechanism in the glass films is Schottky emission with an activation energy of approximately 0. 38 eV. ^ Using the normalized resistance versus temperature data for the thick film resistors, a unit model consisting of sintered particles of RuO(, 2) and non-sintered contacts with RuO(, 2) particles separated by a thin layer of the glass phase has been proposed. The temperature dependence of the theoretical unit has been derived and related to the experimental data by a curve-fitting process. ...|$|R

However, magnetic levitation trains use regenerative braking and plugging braking as opposed to normal trains using regenerative braking and air braking. Regenerative braking is used when the speed of the motor exceeds the synchronous speed. When this happens, the motor changes current flow so that the motor brakes.

30|$|In {{the last}} few decades, Energy {{problems}} are increased rapidly due to fast depletion of the fossil fuel and its highly cost, thus renewable energy plays an alternative way in order to overcome the expected power crisis. Wind energy {{is one of the}} renewable energy sources, where it is clean, plentiful, environmentally friendly, and widely distributed. Also, it reduces the toxic atmospheric and not producing greenhouse gas emissions [1]. Wind energy conversion system converts the wind energy into mechanical energy based on the principle of aerodynamic through the turbine, then the mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy based on the principle of electromagnetic induction through the generator [2, 3]. The usage of DFIG is receiving high attention regarding wind turbines connected to electrical grid. The DFIG is an induction machine with a wound rotor, where the stator windings are connected to grid and the rotor windings are connected to bidirectional converters, thus the stator and rotor windings are connected to grid bus, hence the derived term of ‘doubly fed’ [4, 5]. The DFIG is sensitive to voltage dips during grid fault, subsequently the high current is passing through the power electronic converters [6]. This situation needs special attention to block converters and disconnect DFIG from the grid to avoid any risks [7 – 9]. The fault ride through (FRT) or low voltage ride through (LVRT) is a term that refers to the wind turbines must be remain connected to grid during faults [10]. Also, all requisites for safe operation of DFIG components is required, because of rotor current will become very large during grid faults [11]. Therefore, DFIG requires a protection system called crowbar techniques that usually adopted for limiting the high currents in order to improve the fault handling capacity and protection requirements [12]. The crowbar protection technique is necessary to avoid a disconnecting of DFIG wind turbines during grid faults. Many researches introduce different crowbar protection techniques such as series crowbar resistors connected with stator windings, parallel crowbar resistors connected with rotor windings, and outer crowbar resistors connected between the DFIG terminals and electrical grid [10 – 18]. Traditionally, the parallel crowbar is engaged to rotor windings, where the converters are disabled and the DFIG is converted to a singly fed induction generator. Therefore, the usage of traditional parallel rotor crowbar technique is unsatisfactory for LVRT grid requirements. Recently, this problem is solved by using the outer crowbar technique that designed in [14, 15]. Typically, only 5 % of the faults occurrences in power systems are a three-phase fault with or without ground. Regarding the unbalanced faults, 80 % are single-phase to ground fault and 15 % are double-phase faults with or without ground, where these faults often can be deteriorated to three-phase fault [19, 20]. It is clear that, the single-phase to ground fault is most frequently fault type that occurs in electrical power system. Most researchers concentrate on the studying of DFIG wind turbine behaviours in case of three-phase to ground fault [9 – 18]. This paper proposes a novel controllable CBFT protection technique driven by ANFIS for studied DFIG wind turbines. The ANFIS is a type of artificial intelligent algorithms that involves the two algorithms of fuzzy logic system and neural network system [21 – 23]. Moreover, the ANFIS can be designed and employed to get the benefits of both fuzzy logic and neural structure in one scheme [24, 25]. The proposed protection technique is structured as a combination of three crowbar resistors that connected to wind turbine generator <b>terminals.</b> The combination <b>resistors</b> are connected in different ways which they are controlled by ANFIS networks. The accuracy of proposed CBFT protection technique is studied for different fault types of symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults such as single-phase, double-phase, and three-phase to ground faults. In addition, the behaviours of studied DFIG wind turbines equipped with classical outer crowbar and proposed ANFIS CBFT protection techniques during different fault types are investigated. Also, a comparison with traditional parallel rotor crowbar protection technique as introduced in [10 – 14] is added to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. Moreover, the impacts of different crowbar resistor values on the accuracy of proposed protection technique equipped with studied system are investigated. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the description of DFIG wind energy conversion system. Section 3 describes the structure of ANFIS network. Section 4 introduces the Methods, where the methodology of classical outer crowbar and proposed CBFT protection techniques are driven by ANFIS networks. In Section 5, the simulation results are demonstrated to show the effectiveness of proposed technique. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 6.|$|R
