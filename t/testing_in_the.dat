5|$|Nuclear weapons testing, {{uranium mining}} and export, {{and nuclear power}} have often {{been the subject of}} public debate in Australia, and the anti-nuclear {{movement}} in Australia has a long history. Its origins date back to the 1972–73 debate over French nuclear <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific and the 1976–77 debate about uranium mining in Australia.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of natural circadian rhythms on retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF; Anderson et al. in J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn 20 : 1063 - 1087, 1994). Individuals tested at optimal times (i. e., morning persons <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning and evening persons <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening) showed a significantly greater RIF effect than individuals tested at non-optimal times (i. e., morning persons <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening and evening persons <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning). Thus, the limited quantity of resources available to allocate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inhibitory activity during non-optimal times produced a significant decrement in RIF. These findings are compatible with the inhibitory account of RIF and {{with the notion of}} a resource-demanding process underlying this memory phenomenon. © 2013 Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
5|$|The {{presence}} of certain signs, termed red flags, indicate {{the need for}} further testing to look for more serious underlying problems, which may require immediate or specific treatment. The {{presence of}} a red flag does not mean that there is a significant problem. It is only suggestive, and most people with red flags have no serious underlying problem. If no red flags are present, performing diagnostic imaging or laboratory <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first four weeks after the start of the symptoms has not been shown to be useful.|$|E
5|$|Beagles are the {{dog breed}} {{most often used}} in animal testing, due to their size and passive nature. Beagles are used {{in a range of}} {{research}} procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals or the environment. Of the 8,018 dogs used in <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%). In the UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved. In 2005 beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%). Most dogs are bred specifically for this purpose, by companies such as Harlan. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.|$|E
5|$|He {{delivered}} the inaugural Oscar Mendelsohn lecture in 1971 at Monash University and advocated policies for Australia such as population control, prevention of war, long-term {{plans for the}} management of the environment and natural resources, Aboriginal land rights, socialism, recycling, advertising bans on socially harmful products, and more regulation of the environment. He angrily denounced French nuclear <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific, and after consistently voting for the ruling Liberal Party coalition as it ruled for the past few decades, signed an open letter backing the opposition Labor Party of Gough Whitlam, which took power in 1972. However, he soon spoke out against Whitlam's lack of action against tobacco advertising and French nuclear tests. Burnet often found himself frustrated with the refusal of politicians to base policy on long-term objectives, such as the sustainability of human life.|$|E

40|$|Behavioral {{evidence}} suggests that the attention-based ability to regulate distraction varies across <b>the</b> day <b>in</b> synchrony with a circadian arousal rhythm that changes across the life span. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we assessed whether neural activity in an attention control network also varies across the day and with behavioral markers. We <b>tested</b> older adults <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning or afternoon and younger adults <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon using a 1 -back task with superimposed distractors, followed by an implicit test for the distractors. Behavioral results replicated earlier findings with older adults <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning better able to ignore distraction than those <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon. Imaging results showed that time of testing modulates task-related fMRI signals in older adults and that age differences were reduced when older adults are tested at peak times of day. In particular, older adults <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning activated similar cognitive control regions to those activated by young adults (rostral prefrontal and superior parietal cortex), whereas older adults <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon were reliably different; furthermore, the degree to which participants were able to activate the control regions listed above correlated with the ability to suppress distracting information...|$|R

5|$|In April 1993, Sega {{announced}} the Sega Channel service, which would utilize cable television services to deliver content. National <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States {{for the service}} began in June, and deployment across the United States began in December, with a complete U.S. release in 1994. By June 1994, Sega Channel had gained a total of 21 cable companies signed up to carry the service. Fees in the United States for the service varied depending on location, but were approximately US$15 monthly, plus a $25 activation fee, which included the adapter. The Sega Channel expanded into Canada in late 1995, with an approximately Can$19 monthly fee. During the planning stages of the service, Sega looked {{to capitalize on the}} rental market, which had seen some success with the Sega CD being rented through Blockbuster, Inc., and was looking to base the service's offering of games and demos to help sell more cartridges.|$|E
5|$|She left Soda Creek for {{her first}} trip {{upstream}} on May 23, leaving at the break of day and arriving in Quesnel at 11 am. Captain Browne made semi-weekly trips between Quesnel and Soda Creek until June 23 when he decided that the BX was ready for <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two canyons between Quesnel and Fort George, the Cottonwood Canyon and the Fort George Canyon. He left Quesnel at 1pm and upon arriving at the Cottonwood Canyon, offloaded the passengers and lined through using the steam capstan. However, Browne soon realized that the light and powerful BX {{did not need to}} line through and could run the canyons unaided. By law passengers were forced to disembark and walk around any canyon that a steamer was lining through and be picked up on the other side. However, by the fall of 1910, the federal steamboat inspector decided that the BX was allowed to keep her passengers on board. This gave her a huge advantage over her rivals, all of which had to line through both canyons, wasting time and fuel as well as inconveniencing the passengers.|$|E
5|$|Starting on 1 May, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} a three-day test at the Mugello Circuit in Italy {{ahead of the}} Spanish Grand Prix. The test gave teams the opportunity to assess major aerodynamic upgrades before racing them. HRT elected not {{to take part in}} the test, instead choosing to concentrate on establishing themselves at their new headquarters in Madrid. Both Lotus's trackside operations director Alan Permane and Red Bull Racing driver Mark Webber questioned the value of testing at the Mugello circuit as the characteristics of the circuit were unlike any of the circuits the championship was due to visit after the test, while Caterham driver Vitaly Petrov was critical of the choice of Mugello as a testing venue as he felt it was not safe enough for Formula One. Petrov's comments came shortly after Fernando Alonso crashed on the final morning of the test. Red Bull Racing and Lotus team principals Christian Horner and Éric Boullier were also critical of the test as they felt that the costs of conducting in-season testing outweighed any benefits, with Horner stating his opposition to continuing mid-season <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future.|$|E

5|$|The 1972–73 {{debate over}} French nuclear <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific mobilised several groups, {{including}} some trade unions. In 1972 the International Court of Justice {{in a case}} launched by Australia and New Zealand, and advocated by Dr Helen Caldicott, ordered that the French cease atmospheric nuclear testing at Mururoa atoll. In 1973 Australia's concerns {{saw it as a}} champion and an early adopter of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and around this time, the Government ratified the Seabed Arms Control Treaty. Shortly after this, the Government negotiated with the International Atomic Energy Agency to put in safeguards to ensure Australia could mine and export nuclear material but not breach the intent of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.|$|E
5|$|The longest-lived of the {{radioactive}} isotopes of iodine is iodine-129, {{which has a}} half-life of 15.7millionyears, decaying via beta decay to stable xenon-129. Some iodine-129 was formed along with iodine-127 before {{the formation of the}} Solar System, but it has by now completely decayed away, making it an extinct radionuclide that is nevertheless still useful in dating the history of the early Solar System or very old groundwaters, due to its mobility in the environment. Its former presence may be determined from an excess of its daughter xenon-129. Traces of iodine-129 still exist today, as it is also a cosmogenic nuclide, formed from cosmic ray spallation of atmospheric xenon: these traces make up 10−14 to 10−10 of all natural iodine. It also occurs from open-air nuclear testing, and is not hazardous because of its incredibly long half-life, the longest of all fission products. At the peak of thermonuclear <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s and 1970s, iodine-129 still made up only about 10−7 of all natural iodine. Excited states of iodine-127 and iodine-129 are often used in Mössbauer spectroscopy.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., {{the numbers}} of rats and mice used is {{estimated}} to be from 11 million to between 20 and 100 million a year. Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils. Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species because of their size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast reproduction rate. Mice are widely considered to be the best model of inherited human disease and share 99% of their genes with humans. With the advent of genetic engineering technology, genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can provide models for a range of human diseases. Rats are also widely used for physiology, toxicology and cancer research, but genetic manipulation is much harder in rats than in mice, which limits the use of these rodents in basic science. Over 500,000 fish and 10,000 amphibians were used in the UK in 2016. The main species used is the zebrafish, Danio rerio, which are translucent during their embryonic stage, and the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Over 20,000 rabbits were used for animal <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK in 2004. Albino rabbits are used in eye irritancy tests (Draize test) because rabbits have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack of eye pigment in albinos make the effects easier to visualize. The numbers of rabbits used for this purpose has fallen substantially over the past two decades, in 1996, there were 3,693 procedures on rabbits for eye irritation in the UK, in 2016 this number was just 128. Rabbits are also frequently used for the production of polyclonal antibodies.|$|E
