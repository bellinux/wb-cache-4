500|$|We had a {{marvelous}} antagonist, so omnipotent <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to defeat it or even communicate with it, or {{have any kind}} of relationship with it, made the initial concept of the story false. Here's this gigantic machine that's a million years further advanced than we are. Now, how the hell can we possibly deal with this? On what level? As the story developed, everything worked until the very end. How do you resolve this thing? If humans can defeat this marvelous machine, [...] it's really not so great, is it? Or if it really is great, will we like those humans who do defeat it? Should they defeat it? Who is the story's hero anyway? That was the problem. We experimented with all kinds of approaches...we didn't {{know what to do with}} the ending. We always ended up against a blank wall.|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

The company helps devoted customers advertise its brand by selling souvenir clothing with the In-N-Out logo. Celebrity fans and free endorsements in mass media also promote the business. When Heisman Trophy winner and Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith raved about In-N-Out cheeseburgers during a press conference before the 2007 BCS National Championship Game, a senior executive said, [...] "It does not get much better than <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> We're kind of a small company, {{and we do not}} have any celebrity endorsers.

2500|$|In 1908 Wilbur Wright finally visited Europe and in August made {{a series}} of flight demonstrations which convincingly {{demonstrated}} the superiority of their aircraft, particularly its ability to make controlled banked turns, to the European aviation community. [...] The first flight only lasted 1 minute 45 seconds, in which two circles were flown, but the effect was profound, Louis Blériot saying [...] "I consider <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> in France, and everywhere, a new era in mechanical flight has commenced. [...] I am not sufficiently calm after the event to thoroughly express my opinion. My view can be best conveyed in the words, 'It is marvellous!'" [...] Leon Delagrange simply said [...] "We are beaten". [...] Following these demonstrations, Henri Farman fitted his Voisin biplane with ailerons in order to achieve the full controllability demonstrated by Wilbur Wright: following a falling-out with Gabriel Voisin he then started his own aircraft manufacturing business. [...] His first design, the Farman III (the Farman I and II were Voisin designs that he owned) {{was one of the most}} successful aircraft designs of the pioneer era, and was widely copied by other manufacturers, including one soon-to-be-prominent British firm.|$|E
