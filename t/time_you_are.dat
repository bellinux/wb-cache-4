He went to audition {{for the role of}} Albert Wesker, a role previously played by Jason O'Mara. Describing the character Roberts said, [...] " [...] Chairman of the Umbrella Corporation. He is in a position of power. He pretty much runs the world, and Alice is an annoyance. It's a whole process: I get to set and wardrobe gives me this big, long black jacket, and props comes over and gives me the dark glasses and the gloves. By the <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> all dressed you stand a little straighter, you walk a little differently. He's got everything going for him—he's super fast, super strong, has the ability to regenerate—it's all the elements from the game. That was one thing we all agreed on from the start: this character has to be for the fans." [...] Sienna Guillory reprises her role as Jill Valentine, who was last seen in Resident Evil: Apocalypse.

[...] "Perhaps the next <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in a supermarket you will look for club soda, one out of {{the tens of thousands of}} items available, and then not touch it until months later when a particular substance and a particular object accidentally come together.

2500|$|Mark Kanarick of All Game Guide {{also gave}} Virtual Springfield a {{three out of}} five rating. He praised the game for its {{references}} to the television series, noting that [...] "The inside jokes and story-lines alone make the game worth it for those that are fans. For casual viewers and non-viewers, however, {{there is not enough}} here to warrant purchase of The Simpsons: Virtual Springfield." [...] Kanarick further wrote that while exploring Springfield was fun at times, [...] "it is also very tedious. Reading the map can be a problem, especially for younger kids. If you do not utilize the map to its full extent, you will most likely find yourself lost in the town and unsure of where to go next. Although it is a full town, you do at times feel very constricted, as you can only change directions at certain corners. The rest of the <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> just moving where the computer is telling you to." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's William Abner scored it 75 out of 100, {{writing that}} the game [...] "isn't a {{complete}} product. It's close. And parts of it are just as fun, if not more so, than the earlier games, but {{a laundry list of}} bugs, hardware glitches, and severe multiplayer issues keep the game from reaching its potential." [...] He praised the single-player campaign and the storyline. However, he cited numerous bugs, including no support for Windows 95, despite the box claiming otherwise, and compatibility issues with Windows XP. He was also critical of the absence of Vengeance, despite the box stating it was included, and the fact that multiplayer mode had only five maps and no TCP/IP support. He concluded [...] "If you need your new Myth fix and can't wait for a patch, then the best option is to buy the game from a store that accepts returns in case the game doesn't like your particular system setup. If you can play it, focus your efforts on the campaign - it's fun, {{and for the most part}} works as advertised. Hopefully, by the <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> finished with Connacht's tale, a patch to fix the many multiplayer issues will be ready." ...|$|E
