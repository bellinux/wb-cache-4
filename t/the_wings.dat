5|$|After {{completing}} his fourth season with <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> in 2011–12, Daavettila signed his first European contract {{as a free}} agent, agreeing to a one-year deal with Frederikshavn White Hawks of the Danish AL-Bank Ligaen on June 13, 2012. However {{a little over a}} month later, due to personal reasons, Daavettila sought a release from his contract and was granted on July 30, 2012. On September 13, Daavettila agreed to remain in the ECHL, defecting from <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> to fellow competitor the Colorado Eagles on a one-year deal.|$|E

5|$|Each of <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> {{consists}} of a thin membrane supported by a system of veins. The membrane is formed by two layers of integument closely apposed, while the veins are formed where the two layers remain separate; sometimes the lower cuticle is thicker and more heavily sclerotized under a vein. Within each of the major veins there is a nerve and a trachea, and, since the cavities of the veins are connected with the hemocoel, hemolymph can flow into <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b>|$|E
40|$|The canard had {{an exposed}} area of 28. 0 percent of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> {{reference}} area and {{was located in}} the chord plane of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> or in a position 18. 5 percent of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> mean geometric chord above or below <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> chord plane. <b>The</b> canard leading edge sweep was 51. 7 deg and <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> leading-edge sweep was 60 deg. The {{results indicated that the}} direct canard downwash effects on <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> loading are limited to the forward half of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> directly behind <b>the</b> canard. <b>The</b> <b>wing</b> leading-edge vortex is located farther forward for <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> in <b>the</b> presence of the canard than for the wing-alone configuration. The wake, from the canard located below <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> chord plane, physically interacts with <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> inboard surface and produces a substantial loss of <b>wing</b> lift. For <b>the</b> Mach number 0. 70 case, the presence of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> increased <b>the</b> loading on the canard for the higher angles of attack. However, at Mach numbers of 0. 95 and 1. 20, the presence of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> had <b>the</b> unexpected result of unloading the canard...|$|R
50|$|Placing engines on <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> {{provides}} beneficial wing bending {{relief in}} flight. The further the engines are {{away from the}} fuselage <b>the</b> greater <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> bending relief so engines buried in <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> root provide little relief. Almost all modern large jet airplanes use engines in pods located a significant distance from <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> root for substantial <b>wing</b> bending relief. <b>The</b> pods are in front of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> to help avoid flutter of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> which, in turn, allows a much lighter <b>wing</b> structure. Locating <b>the</b> pod below <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> provides each engine with air undisturbed by <b>the</b> fuselage or <b>wing.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{lower air}} {{pressure}} {{on the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> generates a smaller downward force on the top of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> than <b>the</b> upward force generated by the higher air {{pressure on the}} bottom of <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> Hence, a net upward force acts on <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> This force is called the [...] "lift" [...] generated by <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|R

5|$|In all {{butterflies}} (with {{the exception}} of male Euschemoninae) and in Bombycoidea moths (with {{the exception of}} the Sphingidae), there is no arrangement of frenulum and retinaculum to couple <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b> Instead, an enlarged humeral area of the hindwing is broadly overlapped by the forewing. Despite the absence of a specific mechanical connection, <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> overlap and operate in phase. The power stroke of the forewing pushes down the hindwing in unison. This type of coupling is a variation of frenate type but where the frenulum and retinaculum are completely lost.|$|E

50|$|Also in 1957, <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> {{converted}} to Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars.

50|$|While {{the overall}} mission {{remained}} unchanged, <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> reorganized on 3 February 1992. <b>The</b> <b>wing</b> became <b>the</b> 8th Fighter Wing.

5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has played}} an enormous role in refining <b>the</b> <b>wings,</b> control and sensory systems, {{and anything else}} that affects aerodynamics or kinematics. One noteworthy trait is wing twist. Most insect wings are twisted, as are helicopter blades, with a higher angle of attack at the base. The twist generally is between 10 and 20 degrees. In addition to this twist, the wing surfaces are not necessarily flat or featureless; most larger insects have wing membranes distorted and angled between the veins {{in such a way that}} the cross-section of <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> approximates an airfoil. Thus, the wing's basic shape already is capable of generating a small amount of lift at zero angle of attack. Most insects control their wings by adjusting tilt, stiffness, and flapping frequency of <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> with tiny muscles in the thorax (below). Some insects evolved other wing features that are not advantageous for flight, but play a role in something else, such as mating or protection.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>wing</b> also flew KC-135 jet tankers. The 918th and 921st Air Refueling Squadrons were {{assigned}} to <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> from October to December 1960.

On 25 June 1965 the 11th Air Refueling Squadron was assigned to <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> In 1968, <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> began phasing out its B-52s. This was completed by mid year. On 2 July 1968, <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> was redesignated <b>the</b> 11th Air Refueling Wing. <b>The</b> <b>wing's</b> new designation was short lived, for it was inactivated on 25 March 1969.|$|R

5000|$|An {{aerodynamic}} twist can {{be introduced to}} <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> with <b>the</b> leading edge near <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> tip twisted downward. This is called washout and causes <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> root to stall before <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> tip. This makes the stall gentle and progressive. Since the stall is delayed at <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> tips, where <b>the</b> ailerons are, roll control is maintained when the stall begins.|$|R
5000|$|The Gouge flap [...] "consists of a sharp nosed aerofoil, {{which in}} the closed position, forms part of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> profile [...] <b>The</b> flap tapers with <b>the</b> <b>wing,</b> i.e. <b>the</b> width of the flap at any point is a {{constant}} proportion of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> chord at that point; when open the extended portion also varies with the chord. All sections through the flapped portion of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> are similar in shape and proportion. The flap moves on tracks, rotating conically about an imaginary axis below <b>the</b> <b>wing,</b> nearly parallel to the trailing edge. When open, the flap increases <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> chord and <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> area." ...|$|R
2500|$|For a wing {{to produce}} [...] "lift", {{it must be}} {{oriented}} at a suitable angle of attack relative to the flow of air past <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> When this occurs <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> deflects <b>the</b> airflow downwards, [...] "turning" [...] the air as it passes <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> Since <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> exerts a force on the air to change its direction, the air must exert a force on <b>the</b> <b>wing,</b> equal in size but opposite in direction. This force manifests itself as differing air pressures at different points {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|R
5|$|The main {{veins and}} the crossveins form the wing venation pattern. The venation {{patterns}} {{are different in}} different species. There may be very numerous crossveins or rather few. The Australian Flatwing Damselfly's wings {{are one of the}} few veins patterns. The venation pattern is useful for species identification. Almost all Anisoptera settle with <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> held out sideways or slightly downward, however most Zygoptera settle with <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> held together, dorsal surfaces apposed. The thorax of Zygoptera is so oblique that when held in this way <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> fit neatly along the top of the abdomen. They do not appear to be held straight up as in butterflies or mayflies. In a few zygopteran families <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> are held horizontally at rest, and in one anisopteran genus (e.g. Cordulephya, Corduliidae) <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> are held in the typical damselfly resting position. Adult species possess two pairs of equal or subequal wings. There appear to be only five main vein stems. A nodus is formed where the second main vein (subcosta) meets the leading edge of the wing. In most families a conspicuous pterostigma is carried near the wing tip. Identification as Odonata can be based on the venation. The only likely confusion is with some lacewings (order Neuroptera) which have many crossveins in <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b> Until the early years of the 20th century Odonata were often regarded as being related to lacewings and were given the ordinal name Paraneuroptera, but any resemblance between these two orders is entirely superficial. In Anisoptera the hindwing is broader than the forewing and in both wings a crossvein divides the discoidal cell into a Triangle and Supertriangle.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the forewing is super-hydrophobic; it is covered with minute waxy cones, blunt spikes that create a {{water-repellent}} film. Rain rolls across the surface, removing dirt in the process. In the absence of rain, dew condenses on <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b> When the droplets coalesce, they leap several millimetres into the air, which also serves to clean <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b> It {{has been found that}} bacteria landing on the wing surface are not repelled, rather their membranes are torn apart by the nanoscale-sized spikes, making the wing surface the first-known biomaterial that can kill bacteria.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wings</b> lie flat on {{the body}} and are very {{variable}} in size between species, being reduced in size in some crickets and missing in others. The fore wings are elytra made of tough chitin, acting as a protective shield for the soft {{parts of the body}} and in males, bear the stridulatory organs for the production of sound. The hind pair is membranous, folding fan-wise under the fore wings. In many species, <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> are not adapted for flight.|$|E

5|$|Two {{groups of}} {{relatively}} large insects, the Ephemeroptera (mayflies) and the Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) have the flight muscles attached directly to their wings; <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> can beat no {{faster than the}} rate at which nerves can send impulses to command the muscles to beat. All other living winged insects fly using a different mechanism, involving indirect flight muscles which cause the thorax to vibrate; <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> can beat faster than {{the rate at which}} the muscles receive nerve impulses. This mechanism evolved once, and is the defining feature (synapomorphy) for the infraclass Neoptera.|$|E

5000|$|Washout {{refers to}} a feature of wing design to {{deliberately}} reduce the lift distribution across the span of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> of an aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>wing</b> is designed so that the [...] angle of incidence is greater at <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> roots and decreases across the span, becoming lowest at <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> tip. This is usually to ensure that, at the stall speed, <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> root stalls before <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> tips, providing <b>the</b> aircraft with continued aileron control and some resistance to spinning. Washout may {{also be used to}} modify the spanwise lift distribution to reduce lift-induced drag.|$|R
50|$|The {{crack in}} the {{underside}} of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> grew in length until <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> was so weakened it was unable to support the flight loads during the accident flight, and <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> separated.
