Consistent with previous studies (Bruine de Bruin et al. 2007; Strough et al. 2008, 2011), individuals that committed the sunk-cost fallacy tended to be younger than <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not. Additionally, they reported being significantly more bothered by emotional problems, and reported waiting longer to seek medical attention when they were feeling ill, than individuals <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not commit the sunk-cost fallacy. Moreover, individuals that committed the sunk-cost fallacy had significantly lower incomes. Examining {{the data from the}} BSI- 18, individuals that committed the sunk-cost fallacy displayed more signs of depression than <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not. This relation, however, was not observed for somatization, or either of the two anxiety subscales.

5|$|Many solitary wasps are parasitoids. As adults, <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> feed {{typically}} {{only take}} nectar from flowers. Parasitoid wasps are extremely diverse in habits, many laying their eggs in inert stages of their host (egg or pupa), sometimes paralysing their prey by injecting it with venom through their ovipositor.

The review found that fossil birds from this period generally closely resemble a modern species or genus, and <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not can usually be placed in a modern family with a fair degree of confidence.|$|E
5|$|George's {{arrangement}} remained current until 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia. They {{also published}} B.subg.

They were not ready, however, to tender an infrageneric arrangement encompassing Dryandra, so as an interim measure they transferred Dryandra into Banksia at series rank. This minimised the nomenclatural {{disruption of the}} transfer, but also caused George's rich infrageneric arrangement to be set aside. Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele, B.sessilis is placed in B.subg. Banksia, ser. Dryandra.|$|E

5|$|Infant {{mortality}} is often high among ruffed lemurs, {{but can also}} be highly variable. In some seasons, as many as 65% are unable to reach three months of age, possibly due to falls and related injuries, although in some seasons infant {{mortality is}} as low as 0%. For <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> survive to adulthood, sexual maturity is attained at 18 to 20 months in females and 32 to 48 months in males. Sexual maturity may take longer to reach in the wild compared to captivity. For females, the inter-birth interval, or time between successive offspring, is typically one year, and in captivity, females can remain reproductively active {{until the age of}} 23. The life expectancy for both species of ruffed lemur is estimated at 36 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Like the lanthanides, the {{actinides}} form {{a family}} of elements with similar properties. Within the actinides, there are two overlapping groups: transuranium elements, which follow uranium in the periodic table—and transplutonium elements, which follow plutonium. Compared to the lanthanides, which (except for promethium) are found in nature in appreciable quantities, most actinides are rare. The majority {{of them do not}} even occur in nature, and of <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>do,</b> only thorium and uranium do so in more than trace quantities. The most abundant, or easily synthesized actinides are uranium and thorium, followed by plutonium, americium, actinium, protactinium, neptunium, and curium.|$|E
5|$|Previous authors (Kristjánsson cites Joel Feinberg, Alan Wertheimer and Robert Nozick) {{provided}} {{moral and}} statistical analyses of various thought experiments {{to determine whether}} the proposals they involve are threats or offers. On Kristjánsson's account, by contrast, all of the thought experiments considered are throffers. Instead, he argues, the previous thinkers' analyses attempted to differentiate offers that limit freedom from <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not. They conflate two tasks, that of differentiating threats and offers and that of differentiating freedom-restricting threats from non-freedom-restricting threats. He concludes that the thinkers' methods are also inadequate for determining the difference between freedom-restricting and non-freedom-restricting threats, for which a test of moral responsibility would be required.|$|E

5|$|Sunspots {{are visible}} as dark patches on the Sun's photosphere, and {{correspond}} to concentrations of magnetic field where the convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a result, sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere, and, so, they appear dark. At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none {{can be seen}} at all. <b>Those</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> appear are at high solar latitudes. As the solar cycle progresses towards its maximum, sunspots tend form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as Spörer's law. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.|$|E
5|$|Tessellation or tiling in two {{dimensions}} {{is a topic}} in geometry that studies how shapes, known as tiles, can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are {{that there must be}} no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another. The tessellations created by bonded brickwork do not obey this rule. Among <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>do,</b> a regular tessellation has both identical regular tiles and identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile. There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the equilateral triangle, square, and regular hexagon. Any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a plane with no gaps.|$|E
