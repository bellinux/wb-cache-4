Scattered-near objects are <b>those</b> <b>whose</b> orbits are non-resonant, non-planetary-orbit-crossing and have a Tisserand parameter (relative to Neptune) less than 3. Scattered-extended objects have a Tisserand parameter (relative to Neptune) greater than 3 and have a time-averaged eccentricity greater than 0.2.|$|E

Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the final}} {{decision}} on {{the location of the}} new capital territory, the local landowners and residents of Queanbeyan looked favourably on the possibility of having the territory located nearby. Such a result, it was hoped, would bring improvements to local infrastructure, increase the demand for local goods and services, and raise land values. It was assumed that the existing freehold arrangements would remain, and that <b>those</b> <b>whose</b> land was not required for the city itself would {{be in a position to}} capitalise on the new circumstances.|$|E
