5|$|The 2010–11 Australian Baseball League {{season was}} the inaugural Australian Baseball League (ABL) season, and was held from 6November 2010 to 13February 2011. It came 12years after the old Australian Baseball League ceased {{and is the}} {{successor}} of the mostly amateur Claxton Shield competition that has been played since 1934. The season consisted of six teams competing in a 40-game schedule, followed by a three-round finals series to determine <b>the</b> <b>ABL</b> champion.|$|E
5|$|All but 4 of the {{scheduled}} 120 games were played. The four games {{that were not}} played were the series scheduled between the Brisbane Bandits and the Canberra Cavalry at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground for the ninth round. Flooding in Brisbane had resulted in the Exhibition Ground being used as an evacuation centre for affected residents. Initially <b>the</b> <b>ABL</b> postponed the series, leaving a {{decision as to whether}} the games would be rescheduled to a later time. Just prior to the final round of scheduled games, it was announced that the games would go ahead in the form of two doubleheaders, but that only games that would affect the playoffs would be played. When Brisbane lost the final game of their series against the Adelaide Bite, both they and Canberra were eliminated from contention for the playoffs; hence, the makeup games were not played.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the regular}} season games {{resulted}} in a tie, which is unusual in baseball given the provision in {{the rules of the game}} to play extra innings to determine a winner. The game between the Sydney Blue Sox and the Melbourne Aces at Blacktown Olympic Park was the second game of a makeup doubleheader as a result of rain earlier that weekend washing out two games, and so had been shortened to seven innings. A rain delay during the first game of the day forced the second game to a later start. Under a provision in <b>the</b> <b>ABL</b> rules that is modeled on the International Baseball Federation's tiebreaker rule, in any extra inning that starts within an hour of the curfew time for the game—a time set to allow the visiting team time to meet travel schedules to return home at the end of a series—each team starts with runners at first and second base with nobody out. In addition, no new inning may start within 15minutes of the curfew time. The game was scoreless at the end of the regulation seven innings, and was tied at 1–1 at the end of the eighth inning, which ended at the curfew time. Though the game was an official game, the result did not count towards the season standings.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Australian Baseball League (ABL) {{started in}} 1989 with Adelaide {{represented by the}} Adelaide Giants. <b>The</b> <b>ABL</b> ran from 1989 until it folded in 1999 with the Giants playing all of their home games at Norwood Oval with most being under lights. During their time in <b>the</b> <b>ABL</b> the Giants were affiliated, as were every other team in the league, with a team from Major League Baseball. In a massive coup the Giants managed to get themselves affiliated with the 1988 World Series champions the Los Angeles Dodgers with the team receiving 3-4 'import players' a season from the Dodgers Minor League system to complement their array of 'local' talent. Unfortunately during <b>the</b> <b>ABL</b> the Giants never made the ABL's championship series.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>ABL</b> did not {{burn through}} or {{disintegrate}} its target. It heated the missile skin, weakening it, causing failure from high speed flight stress. The laser used chemical fuel similar to rocket propellant {{to generate the}} high laser power. Plans called for each 747 to carry enough laser fuel for about 20 shots, or {{perhaps as many as}} 40 low-power shots against fragile TBMs. To refuel the laser, YAL-1 would have to land. The aircraft itself could have been refueled in flight, which would have enabled it to stay aloft for long periods. Preliminary operational plans called for <b>the</b> <b>ABL</b> to be escorted by fighters and possibly electronic warfare aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>ABL</b> aircraft would likely have had to orbit near potential launch sites (located in hostile countries) for long periods, flying a figure-eight pattern that allows the aircraft to keep the laser aimed toward the missiles.|$|E
25|$|The {{winner of}} the {{championship}} series is named <b>the</b> <b>ABL</b> Champion for that season, and is awarded the Claxton Shield; the prize given to the top Australian baseball team since 1934.|$|E
50|$|The Quest {{played their}} home {{games at the}} Greater Columbus Convention Center in Battelle Hall. Despite being the league's most {{successful}} team, they had the lowest average attendance per game for <b>the</b> entire <b>ABL</b> for <b>the</b> three consecutive years of <b>the</b> <b>ABL's</b> existence.|$|R
50|$|In 1925, Carr {{was one of}} {{the moving}} forces behind the {{formation}} of the American Basketball League (<b>ABL),</b> <b>the</b> first attempt to create a major professional basketball league in the United States. At <b>the</b> <b>ABL's</b> organizational meeting, held in Cleveland in April 1925, Carr was elected as <b>the</b> <b>ABL's</b> president and secretary. In three years as the league's president, he helped establish clubs in Brooklyn, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, Rochester, Cleveland, Fort Wayne and Chicago, and negotiated with the operators of the Philadelphia Arena and Madison Square Garden to install professional basketball teams in those facilities.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> 2013 <b>ABL</b> Playoffs is <b>the</b> postseason of <b>the</b> 2013 <b>ABL</b> Regular Season {{which began}} on Saturday, 23 May 2013, and {{concluded}} on 12 June 2013 when the San Miguel Beermen were crowned <b>the</b> 2013 <b>ABL</b> Finals Champions after sweeping the Indonesia Warriors in <b>the</b> 2013 <b>ABL</b> Finals. <b>The</b> four teams {{with the best}} regular season record qualified for the playoffs; {{the team with the}} higher seed was awarded the home court advantage.|$|R
25|$|In August 2010 it was {{announced}} {{that there would be a}} new Australian Baseball League and that Coopers Stadium would be the home ground of Adelaide Bite, the team representing Adelaide in <b>the</b> <b>ABL.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Asia Series {{is held in}} November, {{which would}} {{otherwise}} create a conflict for <b>the</b> <b>ABL</b> champion team as the following season would have already commenced. To avoid this, the League announced that during the 2011–12 season, the Perth Heat—2010–11 champions—would be scheduled to have a bye while competing in Taiwan.|$|E
50|$|Most {{recently}} Wyatt {{worked as}} the play-by-play caller for SEN Digital's A-League football games and for <b>the</b> <b>ABL's</b> Melbourne Aces baseball club.|$|R

50|$|After <b>the</b> 2009-10 <b>ABL</b> Season concluded, coach Frank Arsego {{announced}} that he would be departing the club after spending two years in Singapore. Singaporean Neo Beng Siang, who was assistant coach to Arsego during <b>the</b> 2009-10 <b>ABL</b> Season, was chosen to take charge of the team from <b>the</b> 2010-11 <b>ABL</b> Season onwards.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{collapse}} of <b>the</b> <b>ABL</b> after 1999 and the short lived International Baseball League of Australia (IBLA) which ran from 1999-2000 until the 2002 the Claxton Shield was revived in 2003 with South Australia playing their games at the Thebarton Oval before moving back to Norwood Oval in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Because the ABL's season {{takes place}} from November through February, <b>the</b> <b>ABL</b> {{is one of}} baseball's {{recognised}} winter leagues (although it is summer in Australia when the season takes place), where often minor league prospects in North America are assigned as an English-speaking alternative to the primary Spanish-speaking Latin America-based winter leagues.|$|E
25|$|Axitinib, a drug used {{to treat}} renal cell carcinoma, {{has been shown to}} be {{effective}} at inhibiting <b>the</b> <b>Abl</b> kinase activity in patients with BCR-ABL1(T315I). The T315I mutation in the fusion gene confers resistance to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, however axitinib has been successfully been {{used to treat}} a patient with ALL carrying this mutation, as well as CML cells in culture.|$|E

50|$|Tân Bình Stadium played {{host for}} <b>the</b> <b>ABL's</b> first ever Hoops Fest, an annual mid-season {{showcase}} of the league, {{which was held}} 15 March 2013 to 17 March 2013.|$|R
25|$|In the league's second season, it was {{announced}} that an All-Star Game would take place, to be held in Perth on 21 December 2011. Like the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, it would be held midway through the regular season, and would feature {{the best players in the}} league. Rather than the teams in the All-Star Game being made up of players from certain teams, the game would be contested by Team Australia and a team of World All-Stars, selected from the import or international players participating in <b>the</b> <b>ABL</b> at the time.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the season}} started, the Cleveland Rebels, Detroit Falcons, Pittsburgh Ironmen and Toronto Huskies folded, leaving the BAA with only seven teams. The Baltimore Bullets joined the league from <b>the</b> <b>ABL,</b> and were {{assigned}} to the Western Division along with the Washington Capitols to even the divisions. Prior {{to the start of the}} season, the league held its inaugural college draft on July 1, 1947. Each team played 48 regular season games. The Eastern Division was won by the Philadelphia Warriors, the West by the St. Louis Bombers.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>ABL</b> is jointly {{owned by}} MLB (75%) and the ABF (25%). Rather than {{following}} more traditional {{models of the}} franchises being owned privately by individuals or organisations, the league {{is the owner of}} each team. One of the rationales for this structure is to closely manage the financial situation, helping to ensure that all teams are equally viable. It is expected that this arrangement will continue for at least the first five seasons: the period of time covered by the financial commitment made by MLB and the ABF.|$|E
40|$|The {{dependency}} of {{the atmospheric}} boundary layer (<b>ABL)</b> characteristics on <b>the</b> <b>ABL's</b> height is investigated by using large eddy simulations (LES). <b>The</b> impacts of <b>ABL's</b> height on <b>the</b> wind turbine (WT) power production are also investigated by simulating two subsequent wind turbines using the actuator line method (ALM). The results show that, {{for the same}} driving pressure forces and aerodynamic roughness height, the wind velocity is higher at deeper <b>ABL,</b> while <b>the</b> wind shear and the wind veer are not affected by the depth. Moreover, the turbulence intensity, kinetic energy, and kinematic shear stress increase with <b>the</b> <b>ABL's</b> height. Higher power production and power coefficient are obtained from turbines operating at deeper ABL...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> 2013 <b>ABL</b> Playoffs {{started on}} 23 May 2013 and {{concluded}} with the San Miguel Beermen sweeping the Indonesia Warriors in <b>the</b> 2013 <b>ABL</b> Finals {{to claim the}} team's first ever ABL title.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> 2012 <b>ABL</b> Playoffs is <b>the</b> postseason of <b>the</b> 2012 <b>ABL</b> Regular Season. <b>The</b> {{four teams}} {{with the best}} regular season record qualify for the playoffs; {{the team with the}} higher seed is awarded the home court advantage.|$|R
25|$|Imatinib {{is quite}} {{selective}} for bcr-abl, {{though it does}} also inhibit other targets mentioned above (c-kit and PDGF-R), as well as ABL2 (ARG) and DDR1 tyrosine kinases and NQO2 - an oxidoreductase. Imatinib also inhibits <b>the</b> <b>abl</b> protein of non-cancer cells, but these cells normally have additional redundant tyrosine kinases, which allows them to continue to function even if abl tyrosine kinase is inhibited. Some tumor cells, however, have a dependence on bcr-abl. Inhibition of the bcr-abl tyrosine kinase also stimulates its entry in to the nucleus, where it is unable to perform any of its normal anti-apoptopic functions, leading to tumor cell death.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the central {{ownership}} of the teams, all players are paid by the league. This is to ensure that no team receives an unfair advantage over any other with regards to financial success. The payscale has set a number of tiers which group players of similar experience levels, with all players in the same tier receiving the same pay. <b>The</b> <b>ABL</b> has considered the possibility of having one or two marquee players paid above the standard scale, though no final decision has been made with regard to this. One concern about high rates of pay expressed by the ABF was that it was a contributing factor, if not the main factor, in the failure of the previous Australian Baseball League. ABF management has also expressed the concern that if this league were to fail, there may never be another opportunity for professional baseball in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Basketball {{remains a}} popular sport in Springfield's {{sporting}} landscape. Prior to the 2014–15 season, Springfield {{was home to}} the Springfield Armor of the NBA Development League, which began play in 2009 at the MassMutual Center. Beginning in the 2011–12 season, the Armor was the exclusive affiliate of the Brooklyn Nets. For many years, the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Classic has been the semi-official start to the college basketball season, and the NCAA Division II championships are usually held in Springfield. The Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference will play its championships in Springfield from 2012 to 2014. The New England Blizzard of <b>the</b> <b>ABL</b> played its first game in Springfield, and several minor pro men's and women's teams have called the city home, including the Springfield Fame of the United States Basketball League (the league's inaugural champion in 1985) and the Springfield Hall of Famers of the Eastern Professional Basketball League.|$|E
