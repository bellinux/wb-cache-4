5|$|Crystals, though long {{admired for}} their {{regularity}} and symmetry, were not investigated scientifically until the 17th century. Johannes Kepler hypothesized {{in his work}} Strena seu de Nive Sexangula (A New Year's Gift of Hexagonal Snow) (1611) that the hexagonal symmetry of snowflake crystals was due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> packing of spherical water particles.|$|E

The Celtics earned another post-season appearance, where they defeated the Syracuse Nationals 4–1 in the Eastern Division Finals. The Celtics made {{good use of}} the fact that the Los Angeles Lakers had exhausted St. Louis in a long seven-game Western Conference Finals, and the Celtics convincingly won in five games.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after the execution, the ten {{condemned}} prisoners who had had their sentences commuted to twelve months' imprisonment were transported to the prison hulk Justitia, moored at Woolwich on the River Thames. Such ships were used as holding areas prior to convicts being transferred <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> vessel for penal transportation to, at this time, Australia. Residents of Ely tried to hold meetings to complain at this apparent extension of the prisoners' sentences. Despite, or because of, media attention—newspapers of the time took sides depending whether they supported the government or not—the prisoners were returned to Ely gaol; it may all have been a simple mistake by the clerk of the assizes.|$|E
5|$|As IRO expanded, it coordinated its {{activities}} {{more with the}} Bucharest-based BRCC. On Levski's initiative, a general assembly was called between 29 April and 4 May 1872. At the assembly, the delegates approved a programme and a statute, elected Lyuben Karavelov as the organisation's leader and authorised Levski as the BRCC executive body's only legitimate representative in the Bulgarian lands. After attending the assembly, Levski returned to Bulgaria and reorganised IRO's internal structure in accordance with BRCC's recommendations. Thus, the Lovech Central Committee was reduced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> local committee, and the first region-wide revolutionary centres were founded. The lack of funds, however, precipitated the organisation into a crisis, and Levski's one-man judgements on important strategic and tactical matters were increasingly questioned.|$|E
5|$|Chester {{station is}} served by the Bloor-Danforth line which {{operates}} between Kennedy and Kipling stations.

The 300 Bloor-Danforth Night Bus operates on Danforth from 1:30-5:30 a.m. after the line is shut down for nightly maintenance.|$|E

5|$|Rangers played {{its first}} match in May 1872, on Glasgow Green. The club then played home matches on public pitches across Glasgow, first moving <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> home ground at Burnbank in 1875. A year later, Rangers {{played at the}} Clydesdale cricket ground in Kinning Park. This ground was {{improved}} to give a capacity of 7,000, {{but it was not}} owned by Rangers. After hints by the landlords that they wished to develop the site, Rangers left in February 1887. The club shared Cathkin Park with Third Lanark {{for the remainder of the}} 1886–87 season.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL has {{suffered}} from serious morale and disciplinary problems since its establishment. These problems have been driven by uncertainty over the F-FDTL's role, poor conditions of service due to limited resources, tensions arising from FALINTIL's transition from a guerrilla organisation <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> military and political and regional rivalries. The F-FDTL's morale and disciplinary problems have resulted in large numbers of soldiers being disciplined or dismissed. The East Timorese Government was aware of these problems before the 2006 crisis but did not rectify the factors that were contributing to low morale.|$|E
5|$|With {{help from}} American colleagues, Znaniecki {{obtained}} {{an extension of}} his appointment at Columbia University through mid-1940. He then moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and in 1942 obtained American citizenship, allowing him to transition from a visiting <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> professorship. He taught at the University of Illinois until his retirement, deciding not {{to return to the}} communist People's Republic of Poland, established in the aftermath of World War II (despite the offer of a chair at Poznań University). In 1950 he retired, becoming a professor emeritus.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of the IPO, {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of the share offering. Although the share prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed that much of the money would go directly to the Glazers. Furthermore, holders of class A shares would not be entitled <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> dividend, and the structure of the share issue meant that the Glazers' class B shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares, essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in the share price from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total sale value of $233million (£150million).|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{underwear}} {{are described as}} bikini underwear and designed for men and women. For women, bikini or bikini-style underwear is underwear that is similar in size and form <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> bikini. It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the midriff than traditional underwear, panties or knickers, especially suited to clothing such as crop tops. For men, bikini briefs are undergarments that are smaller and more revealing than men's regular briefs. Men's bikini briefs can be low- or high-side that are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of thighs. String bikini briefs have front and rear sections that meet in the crotch {{but not at the}} waistband, with no fabric {{on the side of the}} legs.|$|E
5|$|Men {{were to be}} enlisted {{into the}} Force by a {{specific}} county association {{and as part of}} a specific corps; if that corps contained multiple units, he was to be posted to one of his choosing. As with the Regular Army, men were not permitted to be transferred from one corps to another or <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> unit without their consent. Periods of service were not to exceed four years, and could be extended for a further four years {{at the end of that}} period. If the Force was called out for permanent service when the time for a man's discharge came due, he could be required to prolong his service by up to twelve months. A member of the Force could buy his discharge before the end of his term by giving three months notice and paying a sum of up to five pounds, except in times of embodiment for service, and could be discharged for disobedience to orders or misconduct as judged by his commanding officer. First appointments to the lowest grade of officer in any Territorial Force unit were to be given to persons recommended by the association president, provided they fulfilled all the necessary qualifications.|$|E
