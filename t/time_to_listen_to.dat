500|$|Celia Larkin, {{writing on}} 12 February 2012 in the Irish Sunday Independent, said [...] "There was {{something}} very satisfying about Heather Mills finally having her voice heard above {{the roar of the}} Red Tops. If you actually take the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> Mills, I mean listen, not just read what's written about her, you'll see she is a strong, sincere, independent woman. She didn't lie down under the weight of McCartney's fame and wealth, she continued to plough her own furrow, campaigning for her charities, maintaining a strong individuality. And that, it seems, is the greatest sin of all. Is it any wonder she was reduced to tears in the October 2007 GMTV interview? Did we feel sympathy for her then? No. 'Heather Mills has Melt Down' screamed the headlines, so now she had lost her marbles to boot. And if that wasn't enough, Carole Malone of the Sunday Mirror, one of the papers that was relentless in its attacks on Mills, accused her of staging an act on live TV in order to further her cause in the upcoming divorce hearing. How cruel can you get?" ...|$|E

When asked for his thoughts on the nomination, King revealed {{that he did not}} [...] "even care", and noted that Slayer fans [...] "don't give a shit and that's {{the most important thing to}} me". The interviewer expressed his surprise at the nomination given Slayer's [...] "inflammatory" [...] lyrics, to which King replied, [...] "That would be the coolest thing, you know? To win with the shit we write about." [...] The ceremony was held on February 11, 2007, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, with Slayer competing against Mastodon, Lamb of God, Ministry and Stone Sour. Slayer won the Best Metal Performance Grammy award, although the band was unable to attend because of a conflicting North American headlining tour. Araya commented about the win from a hotel room in Columbus, Ohio: [...] "Jeff [...] and I put a lot into 'Eyes of the Insane' so we're thrilled that the Grammy voters took the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> it, and then vote for it. We're out here on the road and we're all really, really happy." [...] King disagreed, deeming the song [...] "one of the poorest representations of us [...] on the record [...] ". He further said that, if given the decision, he would have chosen the controversial track [...] "Jihad" [...] to represent Slayer from their ninth album Christ Illusion. Critical of the Recording Academy, King said, [...] "Realistically, I think people on the academy who vote pick the household name ... And that's what we are." ...|$|E

During the Edinburgh run, he contributed to The Guardian newspaper's podcasts, despite his new show containing {{a song about}} a Guardian critic who once gave his show a negative review. Responding to the song, which contains graphic violence, the critic laconically remarked {{that he had not}} yet had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> it: [...] "Life's too short and I've already done my bit by sitting through that show in Edinburgh." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Rula Jebreal, a Palestinian {{journalist}} {{and foreign policy}} analyst, Ayaan Hirsi Ali's criticism applies mostly to [...] "Wahhabism", the strain of Islam most familiar to Hirsi Ali, and not to Islam as a whole. Jebreal added that Ali's [...] "outbursts" [...] are originated from her own pains, [...] "physical scars inflicted on her body during childhood," [...] which were justified by a radical version of the religion into which she was born. Jebreal wrote: [...] " [...] To endorse Hirsi Ali so unabashedly is to insult and mock a billion Muslims". [...] "It's <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> {{what is being said}} by the Muslim voices of peace and tolerance. Ayaan Hirsi Ali is not one of them," [...] she added. Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, condemned her [...] "one of the worst of the worst of the Islam haters in America, not only in America but worldwide." ...|$|E

Almost every participant wondered which part of them was “real”. Emma indicated a similar concern, describing {{the feeling of a}} “work mask” coming back on in the field. It was striking how tiring it felt at <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> these narratives, which triggered memories from my own career of just how emotionally and physically draining it is to live with this kind of fragmentation, a reality supported by Horney (1972) in her classic psychoanalytic study of the emotional toll of inner conflicts.|$|R

"Find Your Love" [...] {{was written}} and co-produced by rapper Kanye West, making it his fourth {{collaboration}} with Drake after directing the video for [...] "Best I Ever Had", appearing in Jamie Foxx's song, [...] "Digital Girl" [...] along with The-Dream and featuring on [...] "Forever". When speaking to MTV News in 2009, Drake called the song's co-producer and rapper Kanye West, [...] "the most influential person on his sound", stating, [...] "Before I ever {{got the chance}} to meet him, Kanye West shaped a lot of what I do, as far as music goes, We always, always, always took the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> Kanye's music and appreciate it beyond. We searched the samples and find out where his inspiration came from, because he has one of the best ears in music, period. He knows how to recognize great music that's not his. He knows how to utilize great sounds and great music. So before I met him, I had the utmost respect for Kanye West. I'd even go as far as to say he's the most influential person, as far as a musician, that I'd ever had in my life." ...|$|E

It also stated it was [...] "carefully observing" [...] events in the east and south of Ukraine, and again called for [...] "real constitutional reform" [...] that would turn Ukraine into a federation. In a 7 April opinion piece that appeared in The Guardian, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov wrote that it was Europe and the United States, and not Russia, that was guilty of destabilising Ukraine and that [...] "Russia is doing all it can to promote early stabilisation in Ukraine". The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a stern condemnation of the [...] "criminal order" [...] by Kiev for armed aggression against Donetsk: [...] "The Kiev authorities, who self-proclaimed themselves {{as a result of a}} coup, have embarked on the violent military suppression of the protests," [...] demanding that [...] "the Maidan henchmen, who overthrew the legitimate president, to immediately stop the war against their own people, to fulfill all the obligations under the Agreement of 21 February." [...] Russian president Vladimir Putin compared the siege of the DPR and LPR-controlled cities of Donetsk and Luhansk to the Siege of Leningrad during the Second World War: [...] "Sadly, it reminds me of World War II, when German fascist forces surrounded our cities, like Leningrad, and shelled population centres and their residents".|$|E

This fiction has been kept up during the whole voyage, and on dark nights at the beginning of the seal-fishing it was only with great difficulty that men could be induced to do their spell.
