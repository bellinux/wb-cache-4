5|$|At {{the same}} time as the early nuclear arms control work, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Nathan F. Twining, sent a memorandum, in August 1959, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> Defense, Neil McElroy, which {{suggested}} that the Strategic Air Command (SAC) formally be assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear target list, and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting as in, for example, the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going to a deeper target. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagreed on the policy during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide the policy.|$|E

Heavy rains were reported in southwest and south central Mexico, particularly in Michoacan. High waves were reported along the coast from Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, to Acapulco, Guerrero. In Guerrero, rain caused at least 24landslides, blocking state highways in several locations. Precipitation {{as a result of the}} storm system also resulted in flooding in the port city of Acapulco. Storm flooding damaged 50homes, mainly due to the overflown streams of the Tlapa River. In Colima, coastal flooding induced by a storm surge damaged 34 tourist facilities, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State Economic Development.

5|$|In 1942, Robinson {{was drafted}} and {{assigned}} to a segregated Army cavalry unit in Fort Riley, Kansas. Having the requisite qualifications, Robinson and several other black soldiers applied for admission to an Officer Candidate School (OCS) then located at Fort Riley. Although the Army's initial July 1941 guidelines for OCS had been drafted as race neutral, few black applicants were admitted into OCS until after subsequent directives by Army leadership. As a result, the applications of Robinson and his colleagues were delayed for several months. After protests by heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis (then stationed at Fort Riley) and the help of Truman Gibson (then an assistant civilian aide <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> War), the men were accepted into OCS. The experience led to a personal friendship between Robinson and Louis. Upon finishing OCS, Robinson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in January 1943. Shortly afterward, Robinson and Isum were formally engaged.|$|E
