40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between freshmen retention and selected student services in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). A review of literature revealed that student 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of student services are related to student 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in the academic and social systems of the college, which are closely and strongly linked to student retention. The results from this study will help student services 2 ̆ 7 administrators to effectively lead HBCUs in their retention efforts. This study utilized quantitative methods to determine the relationships between freshmen retention and student services. Questionnaires were administered to 2000 students enrolled in freshmen orientation classes at the sampled institutions, 1014 were returned correctly. The dependent and independent variables were analyzed using Pearson Correlation coefficient and Multiple Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) statistical tools. The 0. 05 level of significance was used to test the null hypotheses.

5|$|Fonseca and the navy's {{high command}} {{were faced with}} two {{extremely}} unpalatable choices. They could use the government-controlled ships to attack and possibly destroy the rebel ships, but doing so would mean destroying three incredibly expensive ships that had received significant global attention and were—in their eyes—a crucial part of refashioning Brazil as a serious international power. Worse, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> chance that the remaining Brazilian ships, {{all of which were}} smaller and much older than the ships controlled by the mutineers, would lose if it came to open combat. But by folding and giving into the rebel's list of demands—that is, demands from the underclass and broadly black naval crews—the elites would suffer an incredible embarrassment.|$|E

The inhabitants of Upper Mesopotamia were made up of Sunni Muslim Kurds and Turks, although <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> Yazidi minority in that region as well. Jews were spread throughout the Islamic world and most Ayyubid cities had Jewish communities due to the important roles Jews played in trade, manufacture, finance, and medicine. In Yemen and some parts of Syria, Jews also lived in rural towns. The Ayyubid emir of Yemen in 1197–1202, al-Malik Mu'izz Isma'il, attempted to forcibly convert the Jews of Aden, but this process ceased {{after his death in}} 1202. Within the Jewish community, particularly in Egypt and Palestine, there existed a minority of Karaites.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the Second World War <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> economic and population decline in Salford.

The city status of the new district was confirmed by additional letters patent issued on the same day. Since the early 1990s, the decline has slowed.|$|E
5|$|Sawmills and gristmills {{were built}} in the {{watershed}} in the early 1800s and there was a mill on the creek by 1788. A large number of small mills producing grist, cider, woolens, and lumber were once on North Branch Buffalo Creek. There was a log school on Buffalo Creek in the 1830s. By the late 1800s, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> lumbering industry. This also caused railroads to be built in the watershed. The lumbering industry became less prominent in the early 1900s. In the late 1800s, the area along North Branch Buffalo Creek was heavily settled and known as Jonestown. A county road paralleled the creek here. In the late 1800s or early 1900s, a locomotive crashed into Buffalo Creek while crossing it.|$|E

5|$|The linen {{industry}} was {{widespread in the}} Fylde during the 18thcentury and Poulton's importation of flax was essential. There were large warehouses at Skippool and Wardleys, owned by linen merchants from Kirkham. By the 19thcentury, craftsmen in Poulton were {{an important part of}} the industry. In the early part of the 19thcentury, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> decline in the craft industries because of increased mechanisation, as well as increased demand for labour. In contrast to neighbouring Kirkham, Poulton appeared to suffer from a lack of enthusiasm for new industrial techniques and opportunities among its industry leaders.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} {{agricultural}} production {{was determined by}} the land and climate. The cold and wet climate meant that more oats and barley were grown than corn. The evidence of bones indicates that cattle were by far the most important domesticated animal, followed by pigs, sheep and goats, while domesticated fowl were very rare. Bone evidence indicates that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> growth in the fish trade around 1000. This increased marine exploitation of the Highlands and Islands may have been {{as a result of the}} arrival of Scandinavian settlers in this period.|$|E
5|$|The {{success and}} {{expansion}} of Islam brought it into contact with different cultures, societies and traditions, {{such as those of}} Byzantines and Persians.

Moreover, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> distance between Medina, the Islamic capital, and the Muslims on the periphery on the Islamic state. Thus far off jurists had to find novel Islamic solutions without the close supervision of the hub of Islamic law (back in Medina).

The attempt was unsuccessful, however, and Tavares was forced to wait until 2009 to participate in the League Entry Draft. In October 2007, however, it was reported that then-Toronto Maple Leafs General Manager John Ferguson, Jr., had offered the 17-year-old Tavares a spot with the team's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Toronto Marlies. Like the NHL, however, the AHL declined to amend its by-laws, and Tavares subsequently returned to the OHL.|$|E
5|$|Following the deindustrialisation of Greater Manchester in the mid-20th century, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> {{economic}} and population {{decline in the}} region, particularly in Manchester and Salford. Vast areas of low-quality squalid terraced housing that were built throughout the Victorian era {{were found to be}} in a poor state of repair and unsuited to modern needs; many inner-city districts suffered from chronic social deprivation and high levels of unemployment. Slum clearance and the increased building of social housing overspill estates by Salford and Manchester City Councils lead to a decrease in population in central Greater Manchester. During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the population of Greater Manchester declined by over 8,000inhabitants a year. While Manchester's population shrank by about 40% during this time (from 766,311 in 1931 to 452,000 in 2006), the total population of Greater Manchester decreased by only 8%.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Białystok {{has been}} a {{destination}} for internal and foreign immigration, especially from Central and Eastern Europe.

Białystok's pre-World War II Jewish population constituted about 63 percent of the city's total population of 107,000. World War II changed all of this, in 1939, around 107,000 people lived in Białystok, but in 1946 – only 56,759, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of the city's history. Currently the city's population is 97% Polish, 2.5% Belarusian and 0.5% of a number of minorities including Russians, Lipka Tatars, Ukrainians and Romani. Most of the modern-day population growth is based on internal migration within Poland and urbanization of surrounding areas.|$|E
