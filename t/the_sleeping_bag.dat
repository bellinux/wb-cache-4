5|$|Strong winds {{prevented}} Mawson {{from continuing}} for two days. Instead, he prepared for travelling alone, removing the rearmost half from the sledge, and rearranging its cargo. To save having to carry excess kerosene for the stove, he boiled {{the remainder of}} the dog meat. Dragging Mertz's body in <b>the</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag</b> from the tent, Mawson constructed a rough cairn from snow blocks to cover it, and used two spare beams from the sledge to form a cross, which he placed on the top. The following day he read the burial service.|$|E
25|$|Looking for {{the murder}} site, a detective {{canvassing}} hotels heard about a man driving a blue Cadillac who cruised the area. Trying to track the man down with this information, women were located who led them, not to a hotel, but to a residence where a blue Cadillac was seen. The registration was obtained, and the car was registered to Shulman's brother. Trying to get information about <b>the</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag</b> in which Bunting was found, detectives learned Sears was the only manufacturer. Sears was contacted {{to see if the}} brother had purchased one with a credit card. Sears said the brother had no card, but pointed out that Shulman had a card. This was how police were initially pointed towards Shulman as a possible culprit. Women later identified him as the man cruising in the Cadillac, and cadaver dogs signaled the possibility of dead remains having been present in the Cadillac. Police searched Shulman's work place and found trace evidence matching that found on the body. Shulman was arrested on 6 April 1996. After interrogation, Shulman confessed to the three murders. (Shulman confessed to the earliest two murders at a later date.) A search of his room revealed hundreds of bloodstains scattered over almost every surface.|$|E
2500|$|Believing he {{had killed}} Stottor, Nilsen seated the youth in his armchair, then noted his mongrel dog, Bleep, licking Stottor's face. Nilsen {{realised}} the tiniest thread of life still clung in the youth: he rubbed Stottor's limbs and heart to increase circulation, covered the youth's body in blankets, then lay him upon his bed. When Stottor regained consciousness, Nilsen embraced him; he then explained to Stottor he had almost strangled himself on the zip of <b>the</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag,</b> {{and that he had}} resuscitated him. Over the following two days, Stottor repeatedly lapsed in and out of consciousness. When Stottor had regained enough strength to question Nilsen as to his recollections of being strangled and immersed in cold water, Nilsen explained he had become caught in the zip of <b>the</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag</b> following a nightmare, and that he had placed him in cold water as [...] "you were in shock". Nilsen then led Stottor to a nearby railway station, where he informed the youth he hoped they might meet again before he bade him farewell.|$|E

2500|$|Uemura {{wrote that}} he almost gave up twice during his 1978 North Pole trip. On the fourth day of his trek, a polar bear invaded his camp, ate his supplies, and poked his nose against <b>the</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag</b> where Uemura lay tense and motionless. When the bear {{returned}} the next day, Uemura was ready and shot him dead. On the 35th day of the trip, Uemura had hunkered down on an ice floe with his malamutes, when there was the roar of breaking ice and the floe cracked into pieces. He and his dogs were stranded on a tossing island of ice. After a night of terror, Uemura found a [...] ice bridge and raced to safety.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1982, Nilsen {{encountered}} Carl Stottor, a 21-year-old homosexual, as {{the youth}} drank at the Black Cap pub in Camden. Nilsen engaged Stottor in conversation, discovering the youth was depressed following a failed relationship. After plying the youth with alcohol, Nilsen invited Stottor to his flat, assuring his guest {{he had no}} intention of sexual activity. At Nilsen's flat, Stottor consumed further alcohol before falling asleep upon an open sleeping bag; he later awoke to find himself being strangled with Nilsen loudly whispering [...] "Stay still". In his subsequent testimony at Nilsen's trial, Stottor stated he initially believed Nilsen was trying to free him from the zip of <b>the</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag,</b> before he returned to a state of unconsciousness. He then vaguely recalled hearing [...] "water running" [...] before realising he was immersed in the water and that Nilsen was attempting to drown him. After briefly succeeding in raising his head above the water, Stottor gasped the words, [...] "No more, please! No more!" [...] before Nilsen again submerged Stottor's head beneath the water.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a collage of}} encounters with people and <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags</b> in West Yorkshire, UK. The encounters begin to highlight broader and deeper phenomena of consumption and disposability of textiles in daily life {{and its relationship to}} their social highs and lows. Barber Swindells observe (both as artists and teachers) the complexities, delights and contradictions of textile use; a recycling unit for unwanted textiles (a concern that 'recycled' textiles are destined for Tanzanian landfill), a music festival where <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags</b> and tents are commonly abandoned or burnt, and a textile art curator and students who volunteer with the Hope Centre, Bradford to recycle <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags</b> to help <b>the</b> homeless during the UK winter months. As artists we record, document and discuss this phenomena; in response we develop ideas in the studio and make work for the biennial. As teachers we integrate these encounters into the University curriculum, involving timetables, workshops and socially related projects. The staff, students and their family members work with the Hope Centre, crafting <b>the</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags</b> in a variety of ways. Barber Swindells recognize their position is multi-faceted - they are participants and observers of the situation and recognize we are all complicit to the era of disposability. The encounters also highlight complex contradictions and beautiful generosity; the students go to Leeds Music Festival and take part in buying tents, <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags</b> to possibly discard. However, the students also volunteer to recycle <b>the</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags</b> and invest their skill, time and care into making 'crafted' interventions for each <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag.</b> <b>The</b> intention is to insert homeliness and individuality into each bag. We see all of this as giving something more than charity; we are interested in the crafted gift and time spent beginning to form small acts of resistance to the dominant flow of globalised sensibilities...|$|R
