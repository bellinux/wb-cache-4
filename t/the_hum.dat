5|$|Yoshimura first {{pitched the}} show to the Homicide: Life on the Street {{production}} team in May 1997 at the San Francisco production center of executive producer Barry Levinson. The episode was discussed and well-received during a round-table discussion involving Levinson, executive producer Tom Fontana, producer David Simon, supervising producer Julie Martin, and consulting producer Gail Mutrux. During that meeting, Markin suggested that the transit authority should pressure the police to resolve the homicide case quickly and get the trains moving again, an element which Yoshimura eventually added to the script. Levinson suggested ending the episode with the detectives {{walking back to the}} surface, then feeling <b>the</b> <b>hum</b> and vibration of the train starting back up under their feet. This suggestion, however, did not appear in the final episode.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a fourth}} type of pickup under a P-90 cover, {{referred}} to as a large mini-humbucker. These, however, are not intended to mimic the sound of a P-90. Like all side-by-side humbuckers, they have lower hum levels. This configuration operates {{in the same way as}} a humbucker: both coils individually respond to string vibrations, but since the two coils have a reversed magnetic polarity, the signal from both coils is added, while <b>the</b> <b>hum</b> is effectively canceled. Consequently, these types of pickups sound more like a humbucker than a P-90.|$|E
25|$|The new {{generation}} Zero-Hum P-90 Hx by Kinman has an authentic P-90 sound and appearance but {{is far more}} complex with some 202 individual parts. Sonically destructive magnetic coupling between the coils is negated by highly efficient magnetic shields around the upper coil. The lower coil is wound with much thicker wire and far fewer turns onto a unique laminated steel bobbin which imparts ultra high efficiency; thus, <b>the</b> <b>hum</b> voltage {{is the same as}} the upper coil and cancels hum perfectly. Kinman advertise their P-90 Hx as having a sonically transparent 600-Ohm hum sensor which is remarkable considering the large amount of hum that P-90s put out.|$|E

500|$|Another {{symbolic}} {{sound is}} <b>the</b> <b>hum</b> of a mosquito. Although his producer insists that these parasites don't live in Los Angeles (since [...] "mosquitos breed in swamps; {{this is a}} desert"), its distinctive sound is heard clearly as Barton watches a bug circle overhead in his hotel room. Later, he arrives at meetings with mosquito bites on his face. The insect also figures prominently into the revelation of Audrey's death; Barton slaps a mosquito feeding on her corpse and suddenly realizes she's been murdered. The high pitch of the mosquito's hum is echoed in the high strings used for the movie's score. During filming, the Coens were contacted by an animal rights group who expressed concern about how mosquitoes would be treated.|$|E

[...] Sam Steele called the lyrics [...] "a stream of received imagery: scraps of media information, interspersed with lifestyle ad slogans and private prayers for a healthier existence.

500|$|The Bulgarians lost Braničevo and Belgrade to Hungary in {{the late}} 1230s. Hungarian crusaders fought in Bosnia between 1235 and 1241. Serbia was never {{directly}} attacked by the Hungarians. However, the Hungarian crusaders did directly threaten Serbian Hum; they may have even occupied parts of it. In 1237, Coloman of Galicia-Lodomeria attacked Hum, but {{it is unclear whether}} they attacked Serbian Hum (Eastern), or western Hum, between the Neretva and Cetina rivers, where the Serbs held no territory at the time. The northern part, which was held by Vladislav's relative, Toljen II, fell quickly, but Vladislav dispatched an army to regain the region. The crusaders were pushed to the border, and Vladislav pursued them as far as the Cetina River, but there were no major encounters. After the incident, the Serbs asserted their possession of <b>the</b> <b>Hum</b> region, and Vladislav added [...] "Hum" [...] to his title.|$|E
500|$|Walton's {{works of}} the 1920s, while {{he was living in}} the Sitwells' attic, include the {{overture}} Portsmouth Point, dedicated to Sassoon and inspired by the well-known painting of the same name by Thomas Rowlandson. It was first heard as an entr'acte at a performance in Diaghilev's 1926 ballet season, where The Times complained, [...] "It is a little difficult to make much of new music when it is heard through <b>the</b> <b>hum</b> of conversation." [...] Sir Henry Wood programmed the work at the Proms the following year, where it made more of an impression. The composer conducted this performance; he did not enjoy conducting, but he had firm views on how his works should be interpreted, and orchestral players appreciated his [...] "easy nonchalance" [...] and [...] "complete absence of fuss." [...] Walton's other {{works of the}} 1920s included a short orchestral piece, Siesta (1926) and a Sinfonia Concertante for piano and orchestra (1928), which was well received at its premiere at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert, but has not entered the regular repertory.|$|E
500|$|While the JNA {{planned the}} {{offensive}} to pre-empt a Croatian attack on Serb-held territory, Croatia saw the moves {{as a prelude}} to JNA attacks on southern Croatia, specifically aimed at the Port of Ploče and possibly Split. To counter the perceived threat, the HV deployed additional troops to the area redesignated as the [...] "Southern Front". HV General Janko Bobetko, appointed to command the Southern Front, reorganised the HVO command structure and assumed command of the HVO in the area to stop the expected JNA/VRS offensive and regain the lost territory along the Neretva River. In late May, Bobetko launched an attack along the Adriatic coast, and in its immediate hinterland, towards besieged Dubrovnik linking up with the HV force in the city and breaking the JNA encirclement of the city by 1 June. The attack coincided with a JNA withdrawal towards Dubrovnik Airport in Konavle and positions within Bosnia and Herzegovina borders, [...] away from the coast. On 23 May, the HV/HVO captured <b>the</b> <b>Hum</b> Mountain south of Mostar.|$|E

500|$|The {{experiment}} {{consisted of}} making audio recordings of a Toyota Prius and combustion engine Honda Accord approaching from two directions at [...] {{to assure that}} the hybrid car operated only with its electric motor. Then test subjects in a laboratory listened to the recordings and indicated when they could hear from which direction the cars approached. Subjects could locate <b>the</b> <b>hum</b> of the internal combustion engine car at [...] away, but could not identify the hybrid running in electric mode until it came within , leaving just less than two seconds to react before the vehicle reached their position. In a second trial, the background sounds of two quietly idling combustion engine cars were added to the recordings to simulate the noise of a parking lot. Under this condition, the hybrid needed to be 74 percent closer than the conventional car before the subjects could hear from which direction the cars approached. Subjects could correctly judge the approach of the combustion car when it was about [...] feet away. This result means that under closer to normal environmental noise, a pedestrian {{would not be able to}} correctly determine the hybrid's approach until it was one second away.|$|E
500|$|Tvrtko was {{the elder}} son of Vladislav Kotromanić and Jelena Šubić, and was likely born {{within a year}} of their marriage, which was celerated in 1337. His father was the brother of the Bosnian ban Stephen II, and his mother the {{daughter}} of the Croatian lord George II Šubić of Bribir. Tvrtko was most likely raised as a Roman Catholic; his mother belonged to the Roman Catholic Church, and his uncle Stephen joined it shortly after Tvrtko's birth. Stephen died in September 1353, leaving behind no sons. Although Vladislav was still alive, Stephen's title passed directly to Tvrtko; the reason for Vladislav's exclusion from the Kotromanić succession is unclear. Tvrtko, however, was only about fifteen years old at the time, so his father governed as regent. Soon after his accession, Tvrtko traveled with his father throughout the realm, to settle relations with his vassals. Jelena replaced Vladislav as regent upon his death in 1354. She immediately traveled to Hungary to obtain consent to Tvrtko's accession from King Louis I, his overlord. Following her return, Jelena held an assembly (stanak) in Mile, with mother and son confirming the possessions and privileges of the noblemen of [...] "all of Bosnia, Donji Kraji, Zagorje, and <b>the</b> <b>Hum</b> land".|$|E
