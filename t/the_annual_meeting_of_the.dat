5|$|As the {{prestige}} of winning the Cup grew, so did the need to attract top players. Only nine months after winning the Cup, in March 1906, the Montreal Wanderers pushed through a resolution at <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) that would allow professional players to play alongside amateurs. Because the ECAHA was the top hockey league in Canada at the time, the Cup trustees agreed to open the challenges to professional teams. The first professional competition came one month later during the Wanderers' two-game, total goals challenge series, which they won 17goals to 5.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, at <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Association for the Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality, DeLee {{spoke out}} {{against the use of}} {{midwives}} for childbirth. DeLee said that midwives stunted the progress of the obsetrical profession and said that he refused {{to take part in the}} education of a provider that lowered the standards of the profession. If obstetrics were seen as dignified work that could draw more than the menial fees charged by midwives, DeLee said, many young physicians would be willing to deliver the patients that were then under the care of midwives.|$|E
5|$|In August and September 1940 the Congress became {{split between}} Ansar and Khatmiyya supporters. At first the Ansar were dominant, but they lost this {{position}} {{by the end}} of 1942. Many of Abd al-Rahman's supporters saw him as a source of financial backing and admired his advocacy of an independent Sudan, but did not follow him as a religious leader and were not members of the Ansar movement. By the end of 1942 the government had decided the Congress had no political value. The Mahdists had split into rival camps, other factions had emerged, and the attendees at <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congress included artisans, merchants and illiterates.|$|E

5|$|The Linguistic Society of America (LSA) {{is governed}} by three {{officers}} and an executive committee. The three officers—president, vice-president, and secretary-treasurer—are elected {{by the members of}} the LSA. The President, elected to a one-year term, serves as the chair of the executive committee, as well as presiding over <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Society. The president is first elected to the vice-presidency for a one year-term, which also carries the title of president-elect, and then assumes the presidency {{at the conclusion of the}} annual meeting. The Secretary-Treasurer is nominated by the Executive Committee and elected by the membership to a five-year term. They serve as the Chief Financial Officer of the LSA. Larry Hyman currently serves as President for 2017, with Penny Eckert as Vice-President. The current Secretary-Treasurer, having taken office in January 2013, is Patrick Farrell who will serve until at least 2018.|$|E
5|$|Shamrock Rovers F.C. is a members' club {{owned by}} the Shamrock Rovers Members Club. The Shamrock Rovers Members Club was {{originally}} formed as the 400 Club in November 2002, by the then privately owned football club's board of directors, to raise funds through the fan base, with {{the sole purpose of}} facilitating a mortgage {{for the development of the}} stalled stadium project in Tallaght. The monthly membership fee was set at €40. However, it became apparent to the members that the funds raised were being used for purposes outside of the stated objective. As a result, the membership took control of the 400 Club, adopted a transparent structure and constitution, and declared itself totally independent of the then board of Shamrock Rovers. The 400 Club consortium played a crucial role in the survival of Shamrock Rovers when the club entered examinership in April 2005. They paid off a portion of the club's debts and assumed responsibility for running it. After the successful acquisition of the club through the examinership process, the 400 Club Trustees became the Board of Directors of Shamrock Rovers Football Club and began the process of building a sustainable club through sensible business practices. Numerous clubs and supporters groups subsequently sought their advice with regard to using the model of the 400 club elsewhere. At <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 400 Club in 2006, the members voted to rename it as the SRFC Members Club, reflecting the reality of their ownership of the football club. At the 2008 meeting, the monthly membership fee was increased to €50. In January 2012, there were more than 400 members of the club. Membership is open to all.|$|E
