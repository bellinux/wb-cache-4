50|$|This {{specialized}} type of <b>tee</b> <b>fitting</b> is {{used primarily}} in pressurized hydronic heating systems, to divert {{a portion of}} the flow from the main line into a side branch connected to a radiator or heat exchanger. The diverter tee is designed to allow flow to continue in the main line, even when the side branch is shut down and not calling for heat. Diverter tees have directional markings which must be heeded; a tee installed backwards will function very poorly.|$|E
50|$|The {{cheap and}} simple water {{aspirator}} {{is the most}} common type of aspirator. It is used in chemistry and biology laboratories and consists of a <b>tee</b> <b>fitting</b> attached to a tap and has a hose barb at one side. The flow of water passes through the straight portion of the tee, which has a restriction at the intersection, where the hose barb is attached. The vacuum hose should be connected to this barb. While previously common for low-strength vacuums needed in chemistry benchwork, they use a lot of water, and depending on what the vacuum is being used for, i.e. solvent removal, they can violate environmental protection laws such as RCRA by mixing these potentially hazardous solvents into the water stream, then flushing them down a drain that often leads directly to the municipal sewer.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to ascertain the condition of braze joints and cooling water hardware from an accelerator section after prolonged use. Metallographic analysis was used to examine critical sites on an accelerator section that had been in use for more than 30 years. The end flange assembly showed no internal operational damage or external environmental effects. The cavity cylinder stack showed no internal operational damage however the internal surface was highly oxidized. The internal surface of the cooling water tubing was uniformly corroding at a rate of about 1 mil per year and showed no evidence of pitting. <b>Tee</b> <b>fitting</b> internal surfaces are corroding at non-uniform rates due to general corrosion and pitting. Remaining service life of the cooling water jacket is estimated to be about 20 years or year 2027. At this time, water supply pressure will exceed allowable fitting pressure due to corrosion of tubing walls...|$|E
50|$|The hyperbass flute {{is made of}} PVC and wood. There {{appear to}} be wide tone holes, made from {{standard}} <b>tee</b> <b>fittings,</b> but without keys; these are covered with the palms of the hands.|$|R
50|$|Remedial {{measures}} for impingement attack include {{modifications to the}} system to reduce the average water velocity, e.g. by using larger diameter tubes or, if appropriate, to lower the pump speed, and/or to redesign {{the part of the}} installation concerned to eliminate the cause of local turbulence, e.g. by using slow or swept bends and <b>tee</b> <b>fittings</b> rather than elbows and square tees. It is important to minimise the possibility of any local turbulence occurring by ensuring that the ends of tubes cut with a tube cutter are deburred and that the tubes are inserted fully to the stops in the fitting before the joints are made, as referred to earlier in this section. In some cases, where the above approaches are not possible, the length of copper tube affected can sometimes be replaced by materials more resistant to corrosion-erosion, e.g. 90/10 copper-nickel (BS Designation CN102) using appropriate fittings, or stainless steel to BS 4127:1994.|$|R
50|$|For a given HVAC system, {{the term}} {{ductwork}} {{refers to the}} set of ducts and <b>fittings</b> (<b>tees,</b> reducers, bends, etc.) {{that are used to}} supply the air to or extract the air from the conditioned spaces. It does not include components such as air handlers, heat recovery units, air terminal devices, coils. Attenuators, dampers, access panels, etc. {{are a part of the}} ductwork but have more functions than conveying the air and are therefore also referred to as technical ductwork products.|$|R
40|$|One of OPG thermal {{station was}} {{designed}} for a stand-by situation to supply within 10 minutes 2, 000 MW to the grid during the summer/winter peaks. These starts-stops led to a high stress on economizer piping welds. Fatigue cracks filled with oxides were developed at the toe root and in the counterbores. Finite element stress analysis (FESA), supported by operating experience data, predicted the life of these welds based on cracks located namely in the counterbore areas (see Figure 1). Periodic and inservice inspections, including TOFD, were performed during a 20 + years of service and the crack growth was monitor based on ISI results. ECA team was asked OPG-Inspection and Maintenance Services (IMS) to detect and size fatigue cracks in the counterbore area of carbon steel boiler feedwater piping welds (OD x t = 324 mm x 38 mm) of a thermal station. A sizing accuracy of Â± 1 mm for the outer ligament was required. It was documented the fatigue cracks could be branched, change the morphology (from oxide-filled wide width to hair-tight aspect); they are tilt at different angles and the cracks have different shapes, with the crack starting location eroded by water and oxide products (see Figure 2). Weld cap may not be totally removed {{in the field and}} access from <b>fitting</b> (<b>Tee)</b> side is limited. The technique must be validated on open and blind trials on retired-for-cause samples with service-induced cracks wit...|$|R
