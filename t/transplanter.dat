25|$|Arable land {{in small}} {{alluvial}} flats of most rural river valleys in South Korea {{are dedicated to}} paddy-field farming. Farmers assess paddy fields for any necessary repairs in February. Fields may be rebuilt, and bund breaches are repaired. This work is carried out until mid-March, when warmer spring weather allows the farmer to buy or grow rice seedlings. They are transplanted (usually by rice <b>transplanter)</b> from the indoors into freshly flooded paddy fields in May. Farmers tend and weed their paddy fields through the summer until {{around the time of}} Chuseok, a traditional holiday held on 15 August of the Lunar Calendar (circa mid-September by Solar Calendar). The harvest begins in October. Coordinating the harvest can be challenging because many Korean farmers have small paddy fields in a number of locations around their villages, and modern harvesting machines are sometimes shared between extended family members. Farmers usually dry the harvested grains in the sun before bringing them to market.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the plants}} are about [...] tall, they are transplanted into the fields. Farmers {{used to have to}} wait for rainy weather to plant. A hole is created in the tilled earth with a tobacco peg, either a curved wooden tool or deer antler. After making two holes to the right and left, the planter would move forward two feet, select plants from his/her bag, and repeat. Various {{mechanical}} tobacco planters like Bemis, New Idea Setter, and New Holland <b>Transplanter</b> were invented in the late 19th and 20th centuries to automate the process: making the hole, watering it, guiding the plant in — all in one motion.|$|E
50|$|A rice <b>transplanter</b> is a {{specialized}} <b>transplanter</b> fitted to transplant rice seedlings onto paddy field. Mainly {{two types of}} rice <b>transplanter</b> i.e., riding type and walking type. Riding type is power driven and can usually transplant six lines in one pass. On the other hand, walking type is manually driven and can usually transplant four lines in one pass.|$|E

50|$|Planting also {{requires}} specialized planting equipment. The most common planting equipment is a waterwheel type <b>transplanter.</b> The waterwheel <b>transplanter</b> utilizes a rotating drum or drums with spikes at set intervals. The drum or drums have a water supply that continuously fills the drum with water. The <b>transplanter</b> rolls the spiked drum {{over the bed}} of plastic. As the drum presses a spike into the plastic a hole is punched a water flows into the punched hole. A rider on the <b>transplanter</b> can then place a plant in the hole. These drums can have multiple rows and varied intervals to create the desired spacing for that particular crop.|$|E

50|$|The {{benefits}} from using plastic mulch {{come at a}} higher cost than planting in bare soil. These costs include equipment, the plastic film used as the mulch, <b>transplanters</b> designed for plastic beds, and additional labor during installation and removal of mulch films. Specialized Mulch Application equipment must be used to install plastic mulch beds into a field. These machines shape the soil and apply the plastic to the prepared soil. <b>Transplanters</b> designed for plastic mulch {{can be used to}} plant the desired crop. Hand transplanting is an option but this is rather inefficient. The removal of plastic mulch also contributes to a higher cost through additional labor and equipment needed.

50|$|Abraham ibn Ezra, {{who in his}} wanderings visited Narbonne in 1160, {{must have}} met Joseph.

Both scholars worked at the same time and along the same lines to popularize Judæo-Arabic science among the Jews of Christian Europe by excerpting from and translating Arabic works. Although Ibn Ezra was Ḳimḥi's superior in knowledge, the latter can rightly claim to have been the first successful <b>transplanter</b> of Judæo-Arabic science in the soil of Christian Europe. His diction is elegant and lucid, the disposition of his material scientific, his treatment of his subject even and without digressions; so that his works are much better adapted for study than those of Ibn Ezra, which lack all these qualifications.|$|E

5000|$|Amos's second book, Minutes in Agriculture, {{appeared}} in August 1804 (with a reissue in June 1810). His stated {{intention was to}} settle the issue of which varieties of grass were most suitable for graziers to use, and his book contained advice on this accompanied by illustrations and dried grass specimens. The more theoretical botanical sections of the work were derivative and on publication attracted largely hostile comment (though later commentators recognised {{the usefulness of the}} practical recommendations). But Amos also added details in his book about the construction and use of a variety of farming implements. These included his own designs for a horse-drawn thistle cutter, sward-dresser and compound roller, and (less well-received because of doubts about its practicality) his own version of a tree <b>transplanter.</b> Moreover, he added his voice to those of fellow improvers by calling for the removal of 'obstacles that oppose the promoting, improving and extending' of agriculture, and he castigates 'gentlemen of landed property' for ignoring the proper management of their land.Amos's other published writings span the years 1798-1816 and chiefly take the form of essays and letters in agricultural journals, covering a variety of topics from potato cultivation to his plans to design a workable reaping machine (in which endeavour, however, he later acknowledged he had been unsuccessful). He won a gold medal from the Board of Agriculture for two of these essays. Of broader appeal, and attracting more interest, were his [...] "Essays on Agricultural Machines" [...] as published in the Board of Agriculture's Communications of 1810. These covered: a new design for a dynanometer (his spelling of dynamometer) for measuring the relative resistances of ploughs or the weight needed to draw them forward; {{the construction of a new}} roller and set of harrows; the breaking of horses and oxen; and the construction of carriage wheels 'upon a new principle'. The most important of these essays, however, was [...] "On the Mathematical Construction of a Plough" [...] in which he offered an original and practical solution to the problem of efficient plough design with special reference to the mouldboard. It was in the course of this essay that he challenged Thomas Jefferson's claim to have discovered the mathematical principles for constructing a mould-board of least resistance. This prompted one of Jefferson's nineteenth-century admirers to vilify Amos posthumously, though less partisan American critics subsequently declared Jefferson's design to be badly flawed. Amos's approach to plough construction, though it built on the work of others, particularly of John Bailey (1750-1819), earned him a place in the history of plough design.|$|E
