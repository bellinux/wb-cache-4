5|$|ENZO (Enzyme Kinetics) is a {{graphical}} interface {{tool for}} building kinetic models of enzyme catalyzed reactions. ENZO automatically generates the corresponding differential equations from a stipulated enzyme reaction scheme. These differential equations are processed by a numerical solver and a regression algorithm which fits <b>the</b> <b>coefficients</b> of differential equations to experimentally observed time course curves. ENZO allows rapid evaluation of rival reaction schemes {{and can be}} used for routine tests in enzyme kinetics.|$|E
5|$|In {{physical}} terms the function is {{represented as a}} superposition of sine waves and <b>the</b> <b>coefficients</b> give information about the function's frequency spectrum. A complex-number form of Fourier series is also commonly used. The concrete formulae above are consequences of a more general mathematical duality called Pontryagin duality. Applied to the group R, it yields the classical Fourier transform; an application in physics are reciprocal lattices, where the underlying group is a finite-dimensional real vector space endowed with the additional datum of a lattice encoding positions of atoms in crystals.|$|E

5|$|Several methods {{exist for}} the {{calculation}} of Taylor series {{of a large number}} of functions. One can attempt to use the definition of the Taylor series, though this often requires generalizing the form of <b>the</b> <b>coefficients</b> according to a readily apparent pattern. Alternatively, one can use manipulations such as substitution, multiplication or division, addition or subtraction of standard Taylor series to construct the Taylor series of a function, by virtue of Taylor series being power series. In some cases, one can also derive the Taylor series by repeatedly applying integration by parts. Particularly convenient is the use of computer algebra systems to calculate Taylor series.|$|E
5|$|Systematic {{interest}} in the letter preference began in 1959 with brand-preference studies by researchers Mecherikoff and Horton.
