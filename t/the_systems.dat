50|$|Rowing is a cyclic (or intermittent) form of {{propulsion}} {{such that}} in the quasi-steady state the motion of <b>the</b> <b>system</b> (<b>the</b> <b>system</b> comprising <b>the</b> rower, the oars, and the boat), is repeated regularly. In {{order to maintain the}} steady-state propulsion of <b>the</b> <b>system</b> without either accelerating or decelerating <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> <b>the</b> sum of all the external forces on <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> averaged over <b>the</b> cycle, must be zero. Thus, the average drag (retarding) force on <b>the</b> <b>system</b> must equal <b>the</b> average propulsion force on <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> <b>The</b> drag forces consist of aerodynamic drag on the superstructure of <b>the</b> <b>system</b> (components of <b>the</b> boat situated above the waterline), as well as the hydrodynamic drag on the submerged portion of <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> <b>The</b> propulsion forces are the forward reaction of the water on the oars while in the water.
