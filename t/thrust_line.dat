2500|$|The Griffon IIB which powered the Mk IV was a {{single-stage}} {{supercharged engine}} of 1,735hp (1,293kW). Stronger main longerons {{were needed to}} cope with the weight of the Griffon and it required a bigger radiator and oil cooler, although it kept the asymmetric under-wing radiator layout of the single stage Merlin marks. The new engine had a lower thrust-line than the Merlin and was set with 2 degrees of downthrust. The lower <b>thrust</b> <b>line</b> and larger capacity of the new engine meant that the contours of the engine cowling were completely changed, with more prominent blisters over the cylinder heads, plus a third tear-drop shaped blister on the upper forward cowling to clear the magneto, and a deeper curve down to the spinner, which was much longer than previous types. The lower cowling lost its [...] "pigeon-chested" [...] appearance, with a shallower curve up to the spinner. A four blade Rotol propeller of 10ft 5 in (3.1 m) was used. Apart from these differences the Mk IV airframe was closely related to that of the Merlin-powered Mk III. One feature of the Griffon engine which was to catch a lot of pilots out was that the propeller rotated in the opposite direction to that of the Merlin; i.e.,: to the left, from the pilot's perspective, rather than to the right. This meant that the powerful slipstream swung the Spitfire to the right on the ground, requiring the rudder to be deflected to the left during takeoff.|$|E

An examination is undertaken to establish whether the integral of relevant characterising domains can represent an interactive measure of the level of robustness. The approach is applied to case studies, one of which is the Ponte della Musica in Rome, Italy (by the architect Kit Powell-Williams and engineers C. Lotti & Associati and BuroHappold).

5000|$|Eight Maybach VL-II [...] {{gasoline}} engines were mounted {{inside the}} hull. Each engine turned a two-bladed, 16 ft diameter, fixed pitch, wooden propeller via a driveshaft and bevel gearing which allowed the propeller to swivel from the vertical plane to the horizontal. With the engines ability to reverse, this allowed thrust {{to be applied}} forward, aft, up or down. It appears from photographs that the four propellers on each side were contra-rotating, each one turning the opposite way to the one ahead of it. Thus {{it would appear that}} the designers were aware that running the propellers in the air disturbed by the one ahead was not ideal. While the external engine pods of other airships allowed the <b>thrust</b> <b>lines</b> to be staggered, placing all four engine rooms on each side of the ship along the lower keel resulted in the Akrons propellers all being in line. This was to prove problematical in service, inducing considerable vibration, especially noticeable in the emergency control position in the lower fin. By 1933, the Akron had two of her propellers replaced by more advanced, ground-adjustable, three-bladed, metal propellers. These promised a performance increase and were adopted as standard for the Macon.|$|R

40|$|Geometrical domains characterising {{the degrees}} of freedom of a {{structural}} system {{within the context of}} Maxwell’s reciprocal representation of force and geometry are likely to provide indicators of the constitutive elements of structural robustness. Structural robustness is defined as the “insensitivity to local failure”. This definition emphasises the structure’s capacity for force redistribution and the possibility of finding alternative load paths in a structure. Features linked to resistance and the redistribution of forces are likely to be modelled by load path, struts and ties or <b>thrust</b> <b>lines,</b> close to geometrical thinking. Since most methods proposed today for assessing the robustness of structures are based on probabilistic approaches, they are of limited interest for the design phase. Of the few approaches that have adopted a deterministic formulation, all provide a type of survey that is based on an in-depth analysis of the structure once it has been designed, according to specific scenarios. A central challenge should be to manage the issue of robustness earlier during the design process, or even to be able to interact with a model of the future structure in order to adjust the features of robustness. This paper explores the ability of geometrical domains to assess some of the relevant elements of structural robustness in terms of design in order to characterise the capacity of structures to redistribute forces. It compares indicators linked to the area of these domains. Based on case studies, this quantification of the structural provision is then compared with indices of deterministic and energetic criteria currently proposed in literature to quantify structural robustness...|$|R
