25|$|Wyden is {{critical}} of the estate tax, which he feels is inefficient, and has voted repeatedly to abolish it. He co-authored the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act, which bans internet taxes in the United States. He has also voted with Republicans to lower the capital gains tax, to encourage {{the study of the}} flat tax, and to require a 3/5 majority to raise taxes. However, Wyden voted against the Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. He has also voted against <b>the</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> <b>amendment.</b>|$|E

He was sharply critical of the bill and certain Democrats who crossed party lines to support it.|$|E

50|$|Article V of the Constitution {{specifies}} {{that if the}} legislatures of {{two-thirds of}} the states apply to Congress {{for a constitutional amendment}} by means of an amendment-proposing convention, then Congress must call that convention. A total of 44 states have submitted applications for a <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> <b>amendment,</b> at some time in the past. However, they were not outstanding simultaneously as some have expired or been rescinded. As of 27 December 2016, there were 28 outstanding applications according to <b>the</b> <b>Balance</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Amendment</b> Task Force which advocates for such an amendment. On 24 February, 2017, Wyoming became the 29th state to call for a convention to pass a <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> <b>amendment.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Three main planks of his {{platform}} were a {{call for}} a constitutional convention to ratify <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Amendment,</b> a promise to increase funds for the space program as a [...] "first step in bringing us toward a solar-powered space satellite to provide solar energy for this planet", and, {{in the wake of}} the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, opposition to nuclear power. On the subject of the 1979 energy crisis, Brown decried the [...] "Faustian bargain" [...] that he claimed Carter had entered into with the oil industry, and declared that he would greatly increase federal funding of research into solar power. He endorsed the idea of mandatory non-military national service for the nation's youth and suggested that the Defense Department cut back on support troops while beefing up the number of combat troops.|$|E
2500|$|Hurt cosponsored <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Amendment,</b> {{which did}} not pass the House of Representatives in November 2011. Hurt said of the bill, “By passing a Balanced Budget Amendment, Congress will be {{required}} to spend no more than it takes in, reining in out of control spending once and for all” Hurt also sponsored the Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act that would exempt private equity funds advisers from certain registration and reporting standards. In July, 2011 Hurt sponsored the Market Transparency and Taxpayer Protection Act which would “protect the taxpayers of the United States by requiring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to sell or dispose of the assets of such enterprises that are not critical to their missions.” [...] However, because very little political leverage was used to pass this legislation, it most likely will die in committee. Hurt’s position on Government regulation is clear in his statement that “By reducing the unnecessary government regulations that hinder small businesses, keeping taxes low and allowing people to keep more of what they make, and cutting spending to get our fiscal house in order, the private sector will gain the confidence necessary to expand and create the jobs that the people of the 5th District need and deserve.” ...|$|E

40|$|While most Americans {{have long}} favored a <b>balanced</b> federal <b>budget,</b> not all do. This paper uses {{cross-sectional}} differences among respondents to two {{public opinion polls}} to try to discriminate among competing hypotheses about why Americans want <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>balanced.</b> Logit models are fit to data from two different public opinion polls : a Gallup poll and a CBS/New York Times poll conducted, respectively, in March and April of 1980, a time when <b>the</b> proposed <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> <b>amendment</b> to <b>the</b> Constitution {{was very much in}} the news. In each case, a large majority favored a <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> requirement. However, they favor it for a smorgasbord of reasons and at unclear price. It appears that political affiliation, ideology and personal circumstances are far less important determinants of the choice than economic rationales. ...|$|R
5000|$|Historically as a {{political}} issue, the deficit, national debt, and <b>the</b> proposed <b>Balanced</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Amendment</b> have ebbed and flowed in levels of discussion and the proposed amendment has varied greatly in level of support. The modern discussion of the issue {{seems to have been}} started by the Republican Party in response to the [...] "guns and butter" [...] policies of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who simultaneously announced his desires for [...] "Great Society" [...] social programs while prosecuting the Vietnam War. Johnson also pushed for Congressional enactment of a surtax as well as other tax increases which allowed him to leave office in 1969 with a <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> (plus a small surplus) on the books. This was the last time the United States would see a <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> until FY 1998.|$|R
50|$|In the House, Capito {{voted for}} <b>the</b> Constitutional <b>Balanced</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Amendment</b> of 2011.

He {{was a prominent}} supporter of the TARP bailout legislation, declaring that he would give up his seat by voting for the bill, which he believed to be essential to avoid a second Great Depression. This issue became a centerpiece of both Marshall's successful 2008 re-election and his unsuccessful 2010 campaign. As a senior Democrat on the Agriculture subcommitte regulating futures and derivatives, Marshall was a moderating voice in the regulation of derivatives during the formulation of the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation.

40|$|Since the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s ratification, {{members of}} Congress, {{following}} Article V, have proposed approximately twelve thousand amendments, and states have filed several hundred petitions with Congress for the convening {{of a constitutional}} convention. Only twenty-seven amendments have been approved in 225 years. Why do members of Congress continue to introduce amendments at a pace of almost two hundred a year? This book is a demonstration of how social reformers and politicians have used the amendment process to achieve favorable political results even as their proposed amendments have failed to be adopted. For example, the ERA 2 ̆ 2 failed 2 ̆ 2 {{in the sense that}} it was never ratified, but the mobilization to ratify the ERA helped build the feminist movement (and also sparked a countermobilization). Similarly, the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s ban on compulsory school prayer led to a barrage of proposed amendments to reverse the Court. They failed to achieve the requisite two-thirds support from Congress, but nevertheless had an impact on the political landscape. The definition of the relationship between Congress and the President in the conduct of foreign policy can also be traced directly to failed efforts to amend the Constitution during the Cold War. Roger Hartley examines familiar examples like <b>the</b> ERA, <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> <b>amendment</b> proposals, and pro-life attempts to overturn Roe v. Wade, but also takes the reader on a three-century tour of lesser-known amendments. He explains how often the mere threat of calling a constitutional convention (at which anything could happen) effected political change. [URL]...|$|R
