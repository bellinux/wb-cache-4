This article describes a VR training and assessment system in laparoscopic rectum surgery. Methods: To give a realistic visual performance {{of interaction between}} membrane tissue and surgery <b>tools,</b> a generalized <b>cylinder</b> based collision detection and a multi-layer mass-spring model are presented. A dynamic assessment model is also designed for hierarchy training evaluation. Results: With this simulator, trainees can operate on the virtual rectum with both visual and haptic sensation feedback simultaneously. The system also offers surgeons instructions in real time when improper manipulation happens. The simulator has been tested and evaluated by ten subjects. Conclusions: This prototype system has been verified by colorectal surgeons through a pilot study. They believe the visual performance and the tactile feedback are realistic.

40|$|The present authors {{attempted}} to bore a glass plate using free-abrasives and a conventional drilling machine. Scratching and cracking action {{caused by the}} moving abrasives {{was applied to the}} working of the glass. The boring <b>tool</b> was a <b>cylinder</b> of 10 mm diameter, having a drilled hole of 6 mm diameter in the center and a cross slit of 2 mm width. The drilled hole was filled with abrasives and water. The rotating boring tool set in the drill chuck was pressed against the glass plate in the casing(or holder). The casing prevents the abrasives and water working in the contact interface between the tool and the work from dispersing. The effect of the abrasives and tool material on the boring was investigated. The abrasives used were Green Carborundum (GC), Carborundum(C) and Alumina (A).

40|$|Cutting tools get {{worn out}} due to wear and are ground {{in order to}} use them again. This wear may be due to {{abrasive}} wear, diffusion wear, fatigue wear, adhesive wear. Wear of tool steels leads to shortening of the length, so small that the tool bits are no more usable. These waste and thrown away tool bits were collected which may include steel waste, pig iron, molybdenum iron, chromium iron, vanadium iron, tungsten iron and other waste material. This mixture was melted in induction furnace at temperature about 1600 o C to 1700 o C. After that the casting of the melt was done through the centrifugal route at speeds of 200 rpm and 250 rpm. The cast obtained is in the shape of <b>tool</b> steel <b>cylinder.</b> Then the samples were prepared for the hardness test, machinability test and SEM analysis. The hardness was measured across the radius of the cast cylinder by using Rockwell hardness test machine in C-scale. The machinability test specimens were taken from the outer zone of the cast cylinder and the test was carried out in Lathe by keeping the variables such as rotation speed (420 rpm), feed rate (0. 15 KM), rack angle (10 0) material to be machined (mild steel) and time of machining (5 minutes 40 seconds) constant. The machinability of the centrifugally cast samples were compared with the as-cast samples. SEM micrographs were taken for the outer region of the cast cylinder and a comparative study was made with the as-cast samples. We found that there is an increase in hardness values with the distance from the centre to the outer periphery of the cast samples also the hardness values are higher for speed 250 rpm than 200 rpm.

40|$|Objective: {{dimensional}} {{guidelines for}} bedrails {{have been developed}} to minimise the risk of patient entrapment within the bed. We examined whether bedrails in a large Irish teaching hospital complied with these standards. Design and setting: survey of 60 accessible beds in six hospital wards. Methods: a specialised cone and <b>cylinder</b> <b>tool</b> that mimics the size and weight of a small adult neck and head was used to determine gaps in the four zones most associated with entrapment. Results: the number of failures for each zone was 15 beds for zone 1 (any space between the perimeters of the rail); 42 beds for zone 2 (the space under the rail); 41 beds for zone 3 (the space between the inside surface of the bedrail and the mattress) and 13 beds for zone 4 (the space between the mattress and rail {{at the end of the}} rail). Failures were more common with hydraulic adjusted than with electric profiling beds. Mattresses that were the wrong size (usually too narrow) or too soft and bedrails that were loose or were poorly maintained accounted for many failures. Conclusion: many beds used in our hospital did not comply with dimensional standards to minimise entrapment risks. This emphasises the need for careful selection of patients for whom bedrails are to be used as well as the need for monitoring and maintenance of bed systems...|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary Swedish {{companies}} {{have a relatively}} small domestic market that quickly becomes saturated. For those companies who are dependent on increased sales {{in order to survive}} or have the ambition to grow internationalization is the one option. Traditionally {{companies have}} ex- panded internationally by first exporting to countries with a short geographical as well as cultural distance. With increased experience the companies have entered markets farther and farther away, culturally as well as geographically. Eventually {{it might be possible to}} for example start production abroad. With today’s increasingly internationally competitive market it becomes more frequent that companies establish business in foreign countries at a more rapid pace. The choice was to study PMC Cylinders, a Swedish medium sized company that has been operating internationally for approximately thirty years. This company ́s internationaliza- tion processes have been analyzed in order to understand factors that might bridge these distances to other countries. These distances can be bridged by for instance existing customers, consultants, sister com- panies with complementary resources or employees with host country origin. Further the way of establishing foreign operations can contribute. With shorter distance there is no big issue. For example Norway was perceived almost like selling in Sweden. When the per- ceived distance is medium, here Germany serves as an example, it becomes more compli- cated. Existing British customer relationships made it possible to enter the German market. It was not enough to use an agent which was the case at an earlier failed attempt. Relation- ships with different actors and ways of entering foreign markets become even more impor- tant when this distance is long. Here China can serve as an example; the country is far away geographically as well as culturally. Together with a customer production was established in the Chinese market. This was also seen as an opportunity by a sister company to follow one of their customers. Thus the efforts of the companies were combined. PMC Cylinders also used employees with technical, cultural and language knowledge to bridge the distance. Thus there were a number of factors making the establishment in China possible. By the study of PMC Cylinders internationalization processes certain patterns were found. The outcome of these patterns is a structured model with a number of steps. This model implies that with increased geographical and or cultural distance the importance of connec- tions and ways of entering the market grows. The model is a decision tree which can be seen as an internationalization <b>tool</b> for PMC <b>Cylinders.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In future {{aviation}} {{and particularly}} in hypersonic systems new propellants will be used, such as liquid hydrogen, liquid methane and possibly liquid oxygen. Previous FP 7 funded studies in Europe such as FAST 20 XX, ATLLAS or LAPCAT investigated advanced vehicles with these fuels for passenger transport like the SpaceLiner or Lapcat A 2 {{and some of their}} constituent materials and associated propulsion challenges. The question of cryogenic propellant storage inside an airliner – although of critical importance but by far not yet mastered – had not been addressed in Europe in comparable detail. The need for more detailed investigations on liquid hydrogen or methane tanks in future airliners is not only urgent in hypersonic aviation, but is also essential for environmental reasons in subsonic aviation. New materials and design concepts are required, such as fiber based composite materials, {{in order to reduce the}} tank weight and to increase the structural performance. This is particularly important if the tank has load carrying functions. Different to current rocket launch systems, the durability through hundreds or even thousands of flight cycles must be assured. Tank liners are another essential element of a tank design in order to assure the material compatibility over long durations. The Cryogenic Hypersonic Advanced Tank Technologies (CHATT) project addressed these challenges within a comprehensive and multifold approach. The focus has been on sophisticated experimental material research campaigns, culminating in the development, manufacturing and testing of four different demonstrator tank structures, each involving individual technologies or design philosophies. On the material research level various CFRP material and layup combinations as well as liner material and CFRP/liner combinations have been evaluated in order to assess their applicability for future advanced hydrogen tank structures. Special attention has been paid on material behavior in cryogenic temperature environments, including micro-crack initiation, thermal cycling, and fatigue. Based on these results, suitable material systems have been selected and utilized for manufacturing of the four tank structures. The largest tank built is a cylindrical vessel with approximately 3 m in length and 1 m in diameter, utilizing a CFRP shell design wound on a polymer liner. Another, smaller cylindrical vessel has been manufactured with innovative dry-wind technology. A third vessel employs a liner-less design, while the fourth tank has been designed and manufactured as a multi-bubble tank suited for non-circular fuselage cross-sections. Testing of the tank structures involved pressurization and mechanical loading tests, as well as cryogenic fluid fill and drain experiments using liquid nitrogen. The material research and tank manufacturing campaigns in CHATT have been complemented by comprehensive system investigations for different types of hypersonic vehicles. These not only provided the reference environmental and load conditions for material and tank research, but also included related topics such as propellant management, propellant cross-feed designs for parallel staged vehicles, cabin environment control and power generation by using cryogenic fluids, and flight control under presence of fluid movement. In particular the propellant sloshing problem has been addressed on a theoretical as well as experimental level. High-fidelity CFD codes have been improved enabling detail investigations of sloshing phenomena. Simultaneously, approximate analytic models were assessed on how far the impact of sloshing on flight vehicle control could be simulated in a fast way. Via coupled analysis, also the impact of sloshing on vehicle aero-elastics and structural sizing could be assessed. Furthermore, analytical and/or numerical analysis <b>tools</b> for <b>cylinder,</b> multi-lobe, and multi-bubble tanks including insulations were developed. These codes have been coupled with high-order optimization suites for overall optimization of tanks. Further associated topics to cryogenic tanks have been investigated as well, theoretically and experimentally, such as ceramic heat exchanger technologies, roughness induced boiling, aerogels for insulation applications, or tank structural health monitoring. One of the central findings of the CHATT-project supported by manufacturing and material tests is the very promising potential of thin-ply CFRP technologies for cryogenic tank applications. Extensive material research and demonstrator tube testing campaigns proved the superior performance of thin-ply approaches for delaying or even preventing cryogenic temperature induced micro-cracking. The results indicate that liner-less and ultra-lightweight cryogenic tank systems could be realized using thin ply approaches...|$|R
