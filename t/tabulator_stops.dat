5000|$|The word tab {{derives from}} the word tabulate, which means [...] "to arrange data in a tabular, or table, form." [...] When a person wanted to type a table (of numbers or text) on a typewriter, {{there was a lot}} of {{time-consuming}} and repetitive use of the space bar and backspace key. To simplify this, a horizontal bar was placed in the mechanism called the tabulator rack. Pressing the tab key would advance the carriage to the next tabulator stop. The original <b>tabulator</b> <b>stops</b> were adjustable clips that could be moved from place to place on the tabulator rack. Fredric Hillard filed a patent application for such a mechanism in 1900.|$|E
