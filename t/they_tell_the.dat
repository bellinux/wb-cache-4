Then <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> truth at unexpected and unfortunate times, sometimes destroying themselves in the process. They are unpredictable." [...] Norton states that the difficulties in reporting on the group cause most writers, including herself, to focus on the [...] "small groups of hackers who stole the limelight from a legion, defied their values, and crashed violently into the law" [...] rather than [...] "Anonymous’s sea of voices, all experimenting with new ways of being in the world".|$|E
