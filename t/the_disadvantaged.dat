5|$|The {{political}} {{freedom of the}} American republic exerted a similar pull.

The clash between Swedish liberalism and a repressive monarchist regime raised political awareness among <b>the</b> <b>disadvantaged,</b> many of whom looked to the U.S. to realize their republican ideals.|$|E
5|$|As Grameen {{bank has}} {{developed}} and expanded {{in the years}} since its beginning, it continues to operate on those same two principles. Today, Grameen bank still assumes that when individuals are provided credit, {{they will be able to}} initiate upward social mobility for themselves through entrepreneurial endeavours. As a result, Grameen differs from many other social justice efforts in that it does not include intensive rehabilitation training programs for <b>the</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> persons it serves. Instead, Grameen gives its borrowers freedom to pursue a better future using the skills they already possess in the best way they can with membership in a five-person support group being the only requirement.|$|E
40|$|A {{conference on}} rehabilitating <b>the</b> {{culturally}} <b>disadvantaged</b> {{was held at}} Mankato College in 1967. The purposes were to provide the trainees (1) the essential information relative to the characteriQtics and problems of. {{as well as the}} methods for. rehabilitating the culturally deprived; (2) an opportunity to cooperatively develop criteria for utilization by state vocational rehabilitation agencies in diagnosing cultural deprivation; and (3) an opportunity to delineate and develop procedures for increasing the provision of vocation rehabilitation services to <b>the</b> culturally <b>disadvantaged.</b> <b>The</b> four sections of the report deal with the following areas: (1) rehabilitating the culturally deprived. (2) approaches to rehabilitating the culturally deprived. (3) representative rehabilitation programs for <b>the</b> culturally <b>disadvantaged.</b> and (4) summary reports of workshop sessions. Topics discussed include: (1) preparing diagnosticians for working with <b>the</b> culturally <b>disadvantaged.</b> (2) communicating with <b>the</b> culturally <b>disadvantaged.</b> (3) approaches in rehabilitating the Indian. and (4) The Minnesota Rampac Project.

5|$|During {{his tenure}} as leader of La Familia Michoacana, Moreno González {{reportedly}} gave loans to farmers, funded schools and churches, financed drainage projects, and carried out several aid campaigns to help out <b>the</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> {{in the state of}} Michoacán. This, along with the manpower of the organization, allowed him get the support of several rural sectors in the state, where many served as informants and collaborators for the cartel. His wife was also known for organizing several self-help seminars in Apatzingán. The support of La Familia Michoacana is rooted in family connections and local communities in Michoacán, and in the supposed exploitation of its citizens by the government.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Bamber {{was born}} on 24September 1899 at 23 Zante Street, Liverpool, the eldest {{daughter}} of Hugh Bamber, a bookbinder, and his wife Mary, née Little. Mary had come to Liverpool as a child when her father, a well-to-do Edinburgh lawyer, abandoned his family after his descent into alcoholism and poverty. Liverpool in the late 19th century suffered extremes of deprivation, and had the highest infant mortality rate in the country. Mary became a trade union organiser and campaigner against deplorable social conditions, and established a reputation as an outstanding platform speaker. She was the dominant early influence on her daughter Elizabeth, who formed a lifelong determination to represent and fight for <b>the</b> <b>disadvantaged.</b>|$|E

40|$|The paper {{provides}} compelling {{new evidence}} from the Legal Australia-Wide (LAW) Survey demonstrating the lower legal capability of multiply <b>disadvantaged</b> people. <b>The</b> most <b>disadvantaged</b> respondents {{were found to be}} significantly more likely to take no action in response to their legal problems. In addition, when they did take action, they were significantly less likely to use self-help resources, and significantly more likely to use not-for-profit legal services, than those less disadvantaged. Further, despite their greater use of not-for-profit legal services, <b>the</b> most <b>disadvantaged</b> group had significantly lower awareness of such services. Implications for policy and effective legal assistance services are discussed. The findings clearly signal the vital role of not-for-profit legal services in extending access to justice to <b>the</b> most <b>disadvantaged</b> members of <b>the</b> Australian community. In addition, given the high use of health or welfare advisers by <b>the</b> most <b>disadvantaged</b> group, <b>the</b> results also point to collaboration between these advisers and public legal services as a key strategy to enhance access to justice for <b>the</b> most <b>disadvantaged...</b>|$|R

30|$|The third panel shows {{results by}} {{socioeconomic}} status. The estimated effects on flagship enrollment are larger in magnitude {{for students who}} are not economically disadvantaged and range from 9 - 13 percentage points.

The estimates for total semesters of flagship enrollment also are larger for <b>the</b> not economically <b>disadvantaged</b> sample, and <b>the</b> estimates for <b>the</b> economically <b>disadvantaged</b> sample are small in magnitude and statistically insignificant. For both groups, we find negative and statistically significant effects on private or out-of-state enrollment in the bandwidth of 10 specification, and for <b>the</b> non-economically <b>disadvantaged</b> sample <b>the</b> estimate for the IK specification is even larger in magnitude (although not statistically significant).|$|R
