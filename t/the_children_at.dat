5|$|Lukić {{notes that}} the {{mortality}} rate among <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> Jastrebarsko was much {{lower than that of}} children at Stara Gradiška and Sisak for two reasons. Firstly, that almost half <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> Jastrebarsko were older children more able to cope with the harsh conditions. More importantly, that from the end of July, twenty-six volunteer nurses from the teachers' school at Rude near Samobor, along with several doctors and other medical personnel, under the leadership of Marinić, began to intervene with the camp administration and Ustaše guards to improve the health of the children. The Ustaše propaganda soon took advantage of the improved condition of the children.|$|E
5|$|Lindenwood University traces {{its roots}} back to George Champlin Sibley, an early 19th-century American explorer, soldier, Indian agent, and politician, {{and his wife}} Mary Easton Sibley, an educator. In 1808, Acting Governor and friend Frederick Bates {{promoted}} Sibley {{to the position of}} chief factor at Fort Osage in western Missouri, near present-day Kansas City, Missouri. While at Fort Osage, Sibley immediately set to work creating relationships with the neighboring Osage tribes. He also Mary Easton, the daughter of Rufus Easton, a prominent St. Louis attorney and Missouri's second Attorney General. The couple were married in 1815. During the Sibleys' time at Fort Osage, Mary began teaching <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> the fort.|$|E
5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} to check on <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting {{to him that he}} had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.|$|E
50|$|Children {{under age}} 18 must be covered for serious suicidal {{symptoms}} or other life-threatening self-destructive behaviors, significant psychotic symptoms, behavior caused by emotional disturbance that places <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>at</b> risk of causing personal injury or significant property damage, or behavior caused by emotional disturbances that place <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>at</b> substantial risk of removal from the household.|$|R
50|$|Except where <b>the</b> <b>child</b> is {{registered}} <b>at</b> {{a school}} for {{children with special needs}} no permission is required from the school or local authority to deregister <b>the</b> <b>child</b> (section 2.4). Parents can deregister a <b>child</b> from <b>the</b> school system by the simple means of notifying the school in writing (section 3.8). There is no action, notification or deregistration process for those children who have never been to school. When a <b>child</b> reaches <b>the</b> age of five parents can choose to register <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>at</b> a school or continue to educate <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>at</b> home as they have been doing since <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> birth.|$|R

5|$|Blyton's {{father taught}} her to play the piano, which she {{mastered}} well {{enough for him to}} believe that she might follow in his sister's footsteps and become a professional musician. Blyton considered enrolling at the Guildhall School of Music, but decided she was better suited to becoming a writer. After finishing school in 1915 as head girl, she moved out of the family home to live with her friend Mary Attenborough, before going to stay with George and Emily Hunt at Seckford Hall near Woodbridge in Suffolk. Seckford Hall, with its allegedly haunted room and secret passageway provided inspiration for her later writing. At Woodbridge Congregational Church Blyton met Ida Hunt, who taught at Ipswich High School, and suggested that she train as a teacher. Blyton was introduced to <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> the nursery school, and recognising her natural affinity with them she enrolled in a National Froebel Union teacher training course at the school in September 1916. By this time she had almost ceased contact with her family.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1942, over 1,000 {{children}} {{that had been}} rounded up during the Kozara Offensive were being held at the Stara Gradiška concentration camp, itself a sub-camp of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex. Information {{about the plight of}} these children was passed to concerned citizens in the NDH capital, Zagreb, one of whom was Diana Budisavljević, an Austrian. Budisavljević approached an Ustaše-appointed {{member of the board of}} the Croatian Red Cross, Kamilo Brosler, and told him about <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> Stara Gradiška. Brosler was horrified, and with the support of representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross began to place pressure on the NDH government to release the children. Budisavljević also used her contacts with the German Army to intervene with the Ustaše regime on behalf of the children.|$|E
5|$|During the happenings of the episode, a man playing Santa at a Christmas-themed ranch {{is shown}} videotaping <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> his ranch. Billie later tells Mulder {{that she saw}} a vision of her {{daughter}} in her room and that she said the number 74. Mulder decides he cannot finish the case and wants {{to take time off}} because he's too close to make any sound judgment. On their way to the airport, Scully comes across the Santa park (situated off of California State Route 74) and decides to stop because of the reference to Santa Claus in the notes. Here they find the videotape setup and tapes dating {{all the way back to}} the '60s, including one of Amber Lynn LaPierre. The man who runs the park is promptly arrested, and Mulder finds graves of children all over his ranch.|$|E

25|$|Working bees {{were held}} at Christmas time to make gifts for the children: {{worn-out}} clothing was cut up and sleeves, collars, and hems were cut from clothing still in use to provide materials for soft toys. More robust toys, such as scooters, carts, swords, and guns were made from materials such as barbed wire and the wood of rubber trees {{in and around the}} compounds. The nuns provided food and gifts for each child. The Japanese officers also gave sweets and biscuits to <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> Christmas. A concert was organised for Christmas 1942, as well as inter-compound games; another less lavish Christmas concert took place in 1943, and a concert party was briefly established before disbanding due to the illness and death of its members.|$|E
25|$|Frederick Wellington {{was born}} in Tara, Ontario, the second son and fourth of five {{children}} to Archie and Mary Taylor. Archie, the son of Scottish immigrants, was a traveling salesman who sold farm equipment. Mary, a devout Methodist, stayed at home and raised <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> <b>At</b> the age of six, Taylor moved {{with his family to}} Listowel, a town fifty miles south of Tara. In Listowel he played for the junior and intermediate teams in the Ontario Hockey Association. In the 1904–05 season, he joined a team in Thessalon, Ontario led by Grindy Forrester when a dispute broke out as to which team held his OHA rights. The OHA, led by secretary W. A. Hewitt, refused to grant Taylor a change of residence permit and banned him from playing in the OHA. He applied for reinstatement, but was denied, and remained in Thessalon through the winter. According to some sources, Hewitt wanted Taylor to play for the Toronto Marlboros and blocked his attempts to play for other teams.|$|E

500|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> {{the talent}} show {{performs}} the song [...] "My Ding-a-Ling" [...] by Chuck Berry. According to Jean, {{it was a}} [...] "huge difficulty" [...] to clear the rights for the song {{so that it could}} be used on the show. John Boylan, who produced the album The Simpsons Sing the Blues, personally appealed to Berry to clear the song for them. The lyrics to [...] "My Ding-a-Ling", with their sly tone and innuendo, caused many radio stations to ban the song. This is parodied in the episode when Principal Skinner rushes the child off the stage before he is able to finish the first line of the refrain. The man who owns the music shop Homer visits is based on actor Wally Cox.|$|E
500|$|Foster's 11-year-old son Kile Glover, Usher's former stepson, was {{declared}} brain dead on July 8, 2012, after {{being struck by}} a personal water craft on Lake Lanier the previous day. Glover died on July 21, 2012, after being removed from life support. Just over a year later, on August 5, 2013, Usher's eldest son, Usher V, was hospitalized in the ICU after he became stuck in a drain while swimming in a pool at Usher's home. The next day, Foster filed a request for an emergency custody hearing in Fulton County Superior Court, seeking temporary primary custody and citing Usher V's [...] "near-death accident" [...] as evidence {{of a lack of}} supervision of <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> <b>At</b> the hearing on August 9, 2013, the case was dismissed and Usher retained primary custody of their two sons.|$|E
500|$|Joint legal custody grants parents joint {{decision-making}} {{rights for}} important {{decisions that affect}} their minor children.

This generally means that both parents must be involved for major legal matters concerning their children, but that ordinary [...] "day-to-day" [...] matters and issues are left to the discretion of the parent who is providing physical care for <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> the time the decision is made.

500|$|At the time, {{a career}} in music in Ukraine meant having an {{unstable}} income, causing Leontovych to seek employment wherever he could find it. Leontovych worked in Kiev, Yekaterinoslav, and Podolia guberniyas {{over the next few}} years in order to remain gainfully employed. His first position after graduating was in a secondary school in the village of Chukiv (present-day Vinnytsia Oblast) as a vocal and math teacher. During this time Leontovych continued to transcribe and arrange folk songs. He completed his [...] "First compilation of songs from Podolia" [...] and began working on his second compilation. He also inspired <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> the school to sing in the choir and play in the orchestra.

500|$|At Tobolsk, she and {{her sisters}} sewed jewels into their {{clothing}} in hopes of hiding them from their captors, since Alexandra had written to warn them that she, Nicholas and Maria had been searched upon arriving in Yekaterinburg, and had items confiscated. Their mother used predetermined code words [...] "medicines" [...] and [...] "Sednev's belongings" [...] for the jewels. Letters from Demidova to Tegleva gave the instructions. Pierre Gilliard recalled his last sight of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> Yekaterinburg: [...] "The sailor Nagorny, who attended to Alexei Nikolaevitch, passed my window carrying the sick boy in his arms, behind him came the Grand Duchesses loaded with valises and small personal belongings.

Tatiana Nikolayevna came last carrying her little dog and struggling to drag a heavy brown valise. It was raining and I saw her feet sink into the mud at every step. Nagorny tried to come to her assistance; he was roughly pushed back by one of the commisars..." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{women and}} {{children}} contributed {{to a sense of}} normality as their presence provided conventional social, family, and gender relations. [...] The internees believed the children's presence made them less selfish, as it forced them to think of the latter's welfare. The women organised Christmas and birthday celebrations. Other diversions such as musicals, plays, recitals, and variety shows were also staged. Although the camp lacked books and educational supplies, the teachers and educational administrators amongst the internees were able to provide lessons for <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> the primary and secondary levels. Additionally, extensive educational opportunities were available for the adults: language courses for Chinese, Malay, and French, and also lectures on photography, yachting, journalism, and poultry-keeping. In addition to the personal diaries kept by internees, many of them now held by the Imperial War Museum, a record of life in the camp was created using a double bed sheet. The Day Joyce Sheet was embroidered and appliquéd with 1100 names, signs and figures including a diary in code.|$|E
