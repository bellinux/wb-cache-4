5|$|Vavilovian mimicry {{is found}} in weeds that come to share {{characteristics}} with a domesticated plant through artificial selection. It is named after Russian botanist and geneticist Nikolai Vavilov. Selection against <b>the</b> <b>weed</b> may occur either by manually killing <b>the</b> <b>weed,</b> or by separating its seeds {{from those of the}} crop by winnowing.|$|E
5|$|A case {{somewhat}} similar to Batesian mimicry {{is that of}} mimetic weeds, which imitate agricultural crops. In weed or Vavilovian mimicry, <b>the</b> <b>weed</b> survives by having seeds which winnowing machinery identifies as belonging to the crop. Vavilovian mimicry is not Batesian, because man and crop are not enemies.|$|E
5|$|Alligator weed was {{introduced}} to the United States from South America. It takes root in shallow water, interfering with navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The alligator weed flea beetle and two other biological controls were released in Florida, greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant. Another aquatic weed, the giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) is a serious pest, covering waterways, reducing water flow and harming native species. Control with the salvinia weevil (Cyrtobagous salviniae) and the salvinia stem-borer moth (Samea multiplicalis) is effective in warm climates, and in Zimbabwe, a 99% control of <b>the</b> <b>weed</b> was obtained over a two-year period.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the possibility of}} reducing of weeding operations to facilitate {{the development of a}} low-cost silviculture system. The study area was located in the Takakuma Experimental Forest of Kagoshima University. The operational time of weeding at a young sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) stand were recordrd during four growing seasons. The stand was divided into five sections, with different weeding schedules used in each section: weeding four times during the 4 -year period (every year), three times, or twice (alternate years). The mean heights of the herbaceous and woody coppices and the degrees of visibility of neighbor planted trees in the stand were measured because these values could affect the efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>weeding</b> operation. <b>The</b> following results were obtained: The operational time per hectare of <b>the</b> <b>weeding</b> twice operations were 30 - 57 % shorter than <b>the</b> <b>weeding</b> four times it, on the other hand <b>the</b> <b>weeding</b> three times operation was 20 % shorter or 5 % longer than <b>the</b> <b>weeding</b> four times it. If <b>the</b> <b>weeding</b> operation frequencies were reduced to half or three fourths, the operational time of weeding didn't reduced by half or three fourths. <b>The</b> reduced <b>weeding</b> schedules caused <b>the</b> herbaceous and woody coppices to grow thickly the following year, which resulted in the need for more <b>weeding</b> <b>the</b> following year...|$|R

5|$|Deliveries of 1972 stock enabled 1938 {{stock to}} be withdrawn, and several cars were {{converted}} {{for use as}} ballast motor cars. The task was more complicated than for earlier stock, as 1938 units had compressors mounted on the trailer cars. The motor cars therefore had to be fitted with compressors, and the couplings were changed from Wedgelock to Ward type. The first four were numbered L140 to L143, and the conversion was carried out at Acton Works in 1972. Another six were converted, two in 1975, two in 1976, and the final two in 1977, which were numbered L144 to L149. L151 and L152 were converted in 1978, and were additionally fitted with weed killing equipment. Another four were added in the same year, numbered L153 to L156. Although the ballast motor cars were normally worked in pairs, some engineering trains had a ballast motor car {{at one end and}} a battery locomotive at the other. One advantage of the ballast motor cars over battery locomotives was that the interiors could be used by personnel and for storing small tools, although they were less powerful, and could only work when the traction current was switched on.

25|$|In {{the period}} {{following}} the initial {{construction of the}} dam in the late 1970s, the lake began to deteriorate due to low rainfall and poor water flows, which saw lake weed overtake the swimming areas.

In an effort to control the problems, signs were erected banning access to the dam wall, and basic handrailing was put up to prevent public access. The lake was subject to regular draining in an effort to control <b>the</b> <b>weed</b> and to flush out the stale, stagnant water. While this did slightly improve the situation in the short term, people were warned not to swim in it. The lake is undergoing a major cleaning project {{so that it can be}} used in the future.
