25|$|When a thread—or in some cases, {{an entire}} forum—becomes unstable, {{the result is}} usually {{uncontrolled}} spam {{in the form of}} one-line complaints, image macros, or abuse of the report system. When the discussion becomes heated and sides do nothing more than complain and not accept each other's differences in point of view, the discussion degenerates into what is called a flame war. To flame someone means to go off-topic and attack the person rather than their opinion. Likely candidates for flame wars are usually religion and socio-political topics, or topics <b>that</b> <b>discuss</b> pre-existing rivalries outside the forum (e.g., rivalry between games, console systems, car manufacturers, nationalities, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Tan Malaka's best-known written work is his autobiography, Dari Pendjara ke Pendjara.

Volume three has an especially loose narrative structure, containing commentary on Marxist historiography, his positions on the ongoing fight with the Netherlands over Indonesia's independence, and reprints of sections of key documents related to the struggle. Dari Pendjara ke Pendjara {{is one of a}} very small number of autobiographies set in colonial Indonesia. The translated book, From Jail to Jail (1991), attracted the English speaking labor movement's attention.|$|E

Fly patterns {{may or may not have}} an image or drawing of the finished fly to guide the tyer. Historically, fly patterns have been included in texts <b>that</b> <b>discuss</b> fishing with a particular genre of fly, fly-fishing technique or fly-fishing for specific species or genre of gamefish. There are, however, texts that are pure fly pattern and tying references with little or no instruction on how to fish them.|$|E

25|$|The Talmud (Menachot 30a) {{says that}} the last eight verses of the Torah <b>that</b> <b>discuss</b> the death and burial of Moses {{could not have been}} written by Moses, as writing {{it would have been a}} lie, and that they were written after his death by Joshua. Abraham ibn Ezra and Joseph Bonfils {{observed}} that phrases in those verses present information that people should only have known after the time of Moses. Ibn Ezra hinted, and Bonfils explicitly stated, that Joshua wrote these verses many years after the death of Moses. Other commentators do not accept this position and maintain that although Moses did not write those eight verses it was nonetheless dictated to him and that Joshua wrote it based on instructions left by Moses, and that the Torah often describes future events, some of which have yet to occur.|$|E
