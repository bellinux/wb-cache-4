The paper also stated that the Obama administration would probably be loath <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> publicly in fear of sparking an Iranian backlash.

500|$|During Kwaśniewski's {{visit to}} Russia in September 2004, Russian {{officials}} {{announced that they}} were willing to transfer all the information on the Katyn massacre to the Polish authorities as soon as it became declassified. In March 2005 the Prosecutor-General’s Office of the Russian Federation concluded a decade-long investigation of the massacre. Chief Military Prosecutor Alexander Savenkov announced that the investigation was able to confirm the deaths of 1,803 out of 14,542 Polish citizens who had been sentenced to death while in three Soviet camps. He did not address the fate of about 7,000 victims who had not been in POW camps, but in prisons. Savenkov declared that the massacre was not a genocide, that Soviet officials who had been found guilty of the crime were dead and that, consequently, [...] "there is absolutely no basis <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> in judicial terms". 116 out of 183 volumes of files gathered during the Russian investigation were declared to contain state secrets and were classified.|$|E
500|$|Bilheimer {{accepted}} Costa's proposition, {{and subsequently}} wrote, produced, and directed Not My Life {{as an independent}} film. Bilheimer, who had received an Academy Award nomination for The Cry of Reason, said that [...] "the unrelenting, unpunished, and craven exploitation of millions of human beings for labor, sex, and hundreds of sub-categories thereof is simply the most appalling and damaging expression of so-called human civilization we have ever seen." [...] Bilheimer's wife, Heidi Ostertag, is Worldwide Documentaries' Senior Producer, and she co-produced Not My Life with him. She said that she found making a film about human trafficking difficult because [...] "people do not want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> issue." [...] Bilheimer found that the connections he had made during the production of A Closer Walk were also useful when producing Not My Life because {{the poor and the}} outcast are at the greatest risk of both HIV/AIDS and human trafficking; there is, for this reason, much overlap between the groups victimized by these two afflictions. Bilheimer attempted to fashion the film {{in such a way that}} every part of it would illustrate a statement made by Abraham Lincoln: [...] "If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong." ...|$|E

There's a thing called heterosexual privilege that the heterosexual community doesn't know about. It's the ability to move freely in the world in a way that assumes that heterosexuality is natural. You don't have people asking you questions about how you got to be that way. You don't have to watch your back when you hold your lover's hand in public." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 2005, the Polish Sejm {{unanimously}} requested Russia {{to classify}} the Katyn massacre, {{the execution of}} over 21,000 Polish POW's and intellectual leaders by Stalin's NKVD, as a crime of genocide.

[...] In March 2010, Memorial called upon Russian president Dmitry Medvedev to denounce the massacre as a crime against humanity. On November 26, 2010, the Russian State Duma issued a declaration that archival material “not only unveils the scale of his horrific tragedy but also provides evidence that the Katyn crime was committed on direct orders from Stalin and other Soviet leaders." ...|$|E
