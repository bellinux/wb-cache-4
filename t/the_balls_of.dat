5|$|The next morning, Mulder shows Scully some tracks by {{the front}} door of the house that appear to be human. Based on the weight distribution, however, the assailant evidently travels on <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> its feet rather than from heel to toe. Additionally, that the {{creature}} lured the mother out of the house in order to get to Louis suggests to Mulder that the creatures are paranormal in nature.|$|E
5|$|Another style {{the dance}} {{industry}} created {{in response to}} hip-hop was jazz-funk. This style was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called In Living Color. The resident dance troupe, The Fly Girls, opened and closed every show with a hip-hop and jazz performance choreographed by Rosie Perez. Jazz-funk (also called street-jazz) is a hybrid of hip-hop and jazz dance. R singer Beyoncé uses this style. Korean dance crew Prepix also uses this style. They have choreographed for K-pop singers Jay Park and G.NA {{as well as for}} K-pop boy bands 2PM and B2ST. Although jazz-funk borrows from hip-hop dance, it is not considered a style of hip-hop because the foundational movements are jazz. In hip-hop—even in lyrical hip-hop—there are no pirouettes or arabesques and dancers do not perform on relevé (on <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> the feet). However, these methods are used in jazz-funk and in jazz dance in general.|$|E

50|$|The {{canonical}} Gaussian cylinder set {{measure on}} an infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space H does {{not correspond to}} a true measure on H. The proof is quite simple: <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> radius r (and center 0) has measure at most equal to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> radius r in an n-dimensional Hilbert space, and this tends to 0 as n tends to infinity. So <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> radius r has measure 0; as the Hilbert space is a countable union <b>of</b> such <b>balls</b> it also has measure 0, which is a contradiction.|$|R

25|$|Maria is {{described}} as a success in her social role as Empress, loved to dance at <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> high society and became a popular socialite and hostess of the Imperial balls; her daughter Olga commented, “Court life had to run in splendor, and there my mother played her part without a single false step.”, and a contemporary remarked on her success: “of the long gallery of Tsarinas who have sat in state in the Kremlin or paced in the Winter Palace, Marie Feodorovna was perhaps the most brilliant”. She longed for the balls and gatherings in the Winter Palace. These also occurred at Gatchina. Alexander used to enjoy joining in with the musicians, although he would end up sending them off one by one. When that happened, Maria knew the party was over.|$|E

In his book, Walking to Victory, Adam Gilchrist described it as [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> the tournament."

2500|$|The {{stance is}} the {{position}} in which a batsman stands to have the ball bowled to him. An ideal stance is [...] "comfortable, relaxed and balanced", with the feet [...] apart, parallel and astride the crease. Additionally, the front shoulder should be pointing down the wicket, the head facing the bowler, the weight equally balanced and the bat near the back toe. As the ball {{is about to be}} released, the batsman will lift his bat up behind up in anticipation of playing a stroke, and will shift his weight onto <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> his feet. By doing this he is ready to move swiftly into position to address the ball once he sees its path out of the bowler's hand.|$|E
2500|$|Wide heels do not {{necessarily}} offer more stability, and any raised heel with too much width, such as found in [...] "blade-heeled" [...] or [...] "block-heeled" [...] shoes, induces unhealthy side-to-side torque to the ankles with every step, stressing them unnecessarily, while creating additional impact on <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> the feet. Thus, the best design for a high heel is one with a narrower width, where the heel {{is closer to the}} front, more solidly under the ankle, where the toe box provides room enough for the toes, and where forward movement of the foot in the shoe is kept in check by material snug across the instep, rather than by the toes being rammed forward and jamming together in the toe box or crushed into the front of the toe box.|$|E
