40|$|Malignant {{cells are}} known to display a {{distinctive}} argyrophilic nucleolar organizer region (Ag-NOR) protein distribution compared with distribution in their benign counterparts. In this study, Ag-NOR staining was applied <b>to</b> <b>smears</b> from reactive and malignant serous effusions. The smears were either unstained or had been previously stained with the Papanicolaou or May-Grünwald-Giemsa (MGG) technique. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the feasibility and usefulness of Ag-NOR staining in diagnostic cytopathology and to set up a procedure that could be used on prestained smears in retrospective studies. The one-step silver staining method was applied <b>to</b> prestained <b>smears</b> after a weak destaining step in trichloracetic acid and <b>to</b> unstained <b>smears</b> after a postfixation step in Carnoy's fluid. Positive results were observed on both destained and unstained preparations, MGG-stained smears showing a better visualization of the silver deposits than Papanicolaou-stained smears. Major differences in size, shape, and distribution patterns of the Ag-NOR-positive granules were observed between neoplastic and reactive cells. Furthermore, the mean number of silver-stained dots per cell was significantly higher in malignant cells (33. 32 +/- 2. 23) than in reactive mesothelial cells (9. 71 +/- 0. 66). These data indicate that this Ag-NOR technique can be profitably applied <b>to</b> prestained cytologic <b>smears</b> <b>to</b> assist in the diagnosis of malignancy and that the technique has the advantage that cellular morphology and silver staining can be evaluated on the same slide...|$|R

25|$|As {{the system}} was being developed, a further {{improvement}} was introduced that allowed for continuous following as opposed to periodic re-setting.

If the signal was properly nulled, the two upper signals would mix and produce a single bright blip on the upper trace, while the lower trace would be nulled, as before. If the signal was not nulled, a faint second blip would appear <b>to</b> <b>smear</b> out the upper trace, noticeable even before the blip on the lower trace became visible.|$|E

25|$|D {{note that}} the {{internal}} energy, , of a solution is lowered by the electrical interaction of its ions, but that this effect can't be determined by using the crystallographic approximation for distances between dissimilar atoms (the cube root of the ratio of total volume {{to the number of}} particles in the volume). This is because there is more thermal motion in a liquid solution than in a crystal. The thermal motion tends <b>to</b> <b>smear</b> out the natural lattice that would otherwise be constructed by the ions. Instead, D introduce the concept of an ionic atmosphere or cloud. Like the crystal lattice, each ion still attempts to surround itself with oppositely charged ions, but in a more free-form manner; at small distances away from positive ions, one is more likely to find negative ions and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Although Lackawanna Steel {{had moved}} to New York in part to avoid unionization, the unions {{followed}} the company. An attempt to unionize the company was made in 1919 by the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers. Lackawanna's Democratic mayor, John Toomey, was supported financially by the Lackawanna Steel Co. Toomey initiated a vicious red-baiting campaign <b>to</b> <b>smear</b> the union organizing effort as communist-inspired and led. The company fired hundreds of workers {{in the summer and}} fall of 1919 for being union members or union sympathizers. Nonetheless, by 1919 more than 18,000 steelworkers at Lackawanna Steel and five other, smaller metallurgical firms in the area were organized by the American Federation of Labor (although Lackawanna officials estimated there were far fewer union members). Lackawanna Steel officials, fearing that immigrant union members would become violent, asked for and received protection from the New York State Police. The Lackawanna Steel organizing drive was part of a nationwide organizing effort by the union, and the union resolved to launch a nationwide strike in the fall of 1919 to organize the entire steel industry. The strike began on September 22, with the union claiming 8,000 of the plant's 9,000 workers had struck and the company asserting only half the workers had walked out. The same day, three riots broke out in the city. Late in the afternoon, during the shift change, a crowd of 7,000 pro-union strikers and supporters began throwing rocks, bottles and debris at the company's guards, and city police were called in to break up the disturbance.|$|E
