40|$|Pressure {{and flow}} {{pulsations}} in the fetal heart propagate through the precordial vein and <b>the</b> ductus venosus (<b>DV)</b> but are normally not transmitted into the umbilical vein (UV). Pulsations in the umbilical vein do occur, however, in early pregnancy and in pathological conditions. Such transmission into the umbilical vein {{is not well}} understood. In particular, {{the effect of the}} impedance changes in <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> due to its tapered geometry is not known. This paper presents a mathematical model that we developed to study the transmission of pulsations, originating in the fetal heart, through <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> to <b>the</b> umbilical vein. In our model, the tapered geometry of <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> was found to be of minor importance and the only effective reflection site in <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> appears to be at <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> inlet. Differences between <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> inlet and outlet flow were also found to be minor for medium to large umbilical vein-DV diameter ratios. Finally, the results of a previously proposed lumped model were found to agree well with the present model of the DV-umbilical vein bifurcation...|$|R

40|$|Ductus venosus (<b>DV)</b> sparing means <b>the</b> {{maintenance}} of blood flow through <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> following reduction of liver venous blood supply during fetal hypoxia. The present study compared {{the reactions of}} the isthmic portion of <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> and intrahepatic veins (IHVs) to catecholamines in vitro. Vessel rings of 1 mm width and 3 mm diameter were obtained from 17 fetal sheep (88 – 136 days gestational age, median 120 days). The immunohistochemical examination of <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> and IHV was performed in eight cases using an antibody against α-smooth muscle actin and an antibody against α-adrenergic receptors. Five vessel rings of <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> in early gestation (median 95 days) {{did not respond to}} KCl-induced depolarisation. Force development in response to KCl of both vessel types increased with gestational age (P < 0. 05). The IHV required 4. 1 ± 0. 8 min (mean ±s. e. m.) and <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> 14. 5 ± 4. 0 min to reach the maximum tension in response to KCl, which was 5. 0 ± 4. 0 mN in the IHV and 2. 2 ± 1. 9 mN in <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> (n = 12, P < 0. 05). The maximum forces developed in response to noradrenaline (norepinephrine; 42 μm, n = 9) and adrenaline (epinephrine; 100 μm, n = 12) were about sixfold higher in the IHV rings than in <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> rings (P < 0. 05). The EC 50 values of <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> and <b>the</b> IHV rings to noradrenaline were 5. 9 ± 1. 3 μm and 5. 0 ± 1. 3 μm, respectively (P = 0. 03). The EC 50 values of the adrenaline responses were 2. 5 ± 0. 5 μm for <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> and 2. 2 ± 0. 7 μm for the IHV (not significant). The α-adrenergic receptors were present in the well-structured media of IHVs, but were less distinctive in the wall of <b>the</b> <b>DV.</b> DV sparing can be attributed to an increased resistance of IHVs to catecholamines compared with <b>the</b> <b>DV.</b> <b>The</b> different responses can be explained by different anatomical and functional properties of the two vessel types...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Recent {{findings}} {{have suggested that}} ductus venosus blood flow in the first trimester {{may be influenced by}} fetal gender. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate further the influence of fetal gender on ductus venosus (DV) pulsatility index (PI) and diameter at gestational age 17 - 37 weeks. Material and Method: This was a cross-sectional study. Three measurements were made for each <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> PI and diameter in each fetus during fetal quiescence. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 14. 0 software was used to create nomograms for <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> PI and diameter against gestational age in each gender group. <b>The</b> <b>DV</b> PI and diameter were compared between fetal genders using independent Student’s t-test. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> PI and diameter between fetal sexes. Conclusion: Fetal gender does not influence <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> PI and diameter at gestational age 17 - 37 weeks...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>DV</b> (digestive vacuole) of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, is {{the site}} of Hb (haemoglobin) {{digestion}} and haem detoxification and, as a consequence, the site of action of CQ (chloroquine) and related antimalarials. However, the precise pH of <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> and <b>the</b> endocytic vesicles that feed it has proved difficult to ascertain. We have developed new methods using EGFP [enhanced GFP (green fluorescent protein) ] to measure the pH of intracellular compartments. We have generated a series of transfectants in CQ-sensitive and -resistant parasite strains expressing GFP chimaeras of <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> haemoglobinase, plasmepsin II. Using a quantitative flow cytometric assay, <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> pH was determined to be 5. 4 – 5. 5. No differences were detected between CQ-sensitive and -resistant strains. We have also developed a method that relies on the pH dependence of GFP photobleaching kinetics to estimate the pH of <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> compartment. This method gives a pH estimate consistent with the intensity-based measurement. Accumulation of the pH-sensitive probe, LysoSensor Blue, in <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> confirms <b>the</b> acidity of this compartment and shows that the cytostomal vesicles are not measurably acidic, indicating that they are unlikely to be the site of Hb digestion or the site of CQ accumulation. We show that a GFP probe located outside <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> reports a pH value close to neutral. The transfectants and methods that we have developed represent useful tools for investigating the pH of GFP-containing compartments and should be of general use in other systems...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{diversity}} visa (<b>DV)</b> lottery {{was created}} {{as part of}} a larger immigration bill in 1990 in order to diversify an immigrant pool that has favored Asian and Hispanic immigrants since the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Traditional research on the national security ramifications of immigration policy has focused on highly publicized issues, such as illegal immigration and asylum and amnesty programs, to the exclusion of the risks of fraud and terrorism inherent in <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> lottery. <b>The</b> purpose of this qualitative single case study was to explore the national security vulnerabilities of <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> lottery. Open-ended interviews were conducted with a snowball sample of 10 foreign service officers who adjudicate lottery visas for U. S. immigration from nations designated as state sponsors of terror. Guided by the framework of systems theory and the theory of constraints, content analysis was employed to reveal patterns and themes in the data. The findings were consonant with the framework, revealing the barriers and vulnerabilities of <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> lottery. Other findings showed both that <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> lottery has a negative impact on U. S. national security and fraud remains a serious concern, and yet there was no consensus on the scope and origin of potential terrorist threats. Recommendations include increasing collaboration and integration among agencies implementing <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> lottery, developing information-sharing agreements with other countries, and taking measures to eliminate fraud. The implications for social change include informing the public, immigration agencies, academics, and policy makers about the vulnerability of <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> lottery to fraud and misrepresentation; enhancing the debate about balancing immigration policies and national security; and possibly ending <b>the</b> <b>DV</b> lottery...|$|R
