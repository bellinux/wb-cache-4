5|$|Browne's {{interest}} in Amazing declined when the project <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> slick magazine was derailed. Although he stayed involved with Fantastic Adventures, another Ziff-Davis magazine, {{he left the}} editing work on Amazing to William Hamling and Lila Shaffer. In December 1950, when Ziff-Davis moved their offices from Chicago to New York, Hamling stayed behind in Chicago, and Browne revived his involvement with the magazine.|$|E

5|$|After a {{long night}} of drinking, Homer and Grampa awaken and {{discover}} that they bought the pub from Tom O'Flanagan during the previous night's binge, much to their shock and dismay. They rename the bar and try to continue running it but get no business and {{have to find a}} way to market their unwelcoming business. Homer gets help from Moe Szyslak, who suggests that they allow people to do illegal things in their pub. They find out that smoking is now banned from Irish pubs and Moe urges the Simpsons <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> smokeasy. They do a roaring trade, but are closed down by the Irish authorities. As a punishment, Homer and Grampa are deported back to America and have to pay a small fine. Chief Wiggum arrives to bring them back to the U.S., but accidentally hits himself with his nightstick and then Maces and Tasers himself.|$|E
5|$|Coastal erosion {{remained}} a problem. By {{the middle of}} the century, the tides had reached the southern edge of the castle, and a 1866 report stated that the walls had been undermined by the sea. Despite protective piles being driven around the castle, it was badly affected by flooding in 1875 and 1878, creating serious fissures in the stonework. The high costs of maintaining the property, combined with its dwindling utility, encouraged the government to sell the castle to the South Eastern Railway company in 1888, who intended <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> railway station. It was then sold to private owners and a small museum was created in the castle, which was sometimes opened to the public for an entry price of one penny.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} {{immediate}} ideas for redevelopment of the base was <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> federal prison, something which had been done previously at the former Carswell AFB in Texas when the Federal Medical Center, Carswell was opened on its grounds. Many other former Air Force facilities have had prisons opened up on their grounds as well. From the outset, there was some reluctance in the town about turning it into creating a prison culture in Limestone, but this was lessened once the government decided {{that it did not}} want to build a federal prison {{on the grounds of the}} former air base.|$|E

5|$|The Palladium cinema {{was opened}} as the Empire in 1913 in a {{building}} which had previously been a brewery. It closed in 1993 and various attempts were made <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> club and shop, before Wetherspoons announced in January 2015 that they had acquired the site and intended to seek planning and licensing permission to convert it to a pub. The town was left without cinema for almost two decades. Cinema was {{brought back to the}} town under the Palladium name in 2012 with a new community cinema at the Town Hall. In 2013, permanent cinema equipment was installed in the building and there are now regular film screenings of both modern and classic films.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} encouraged Gaunt {{to further}} expand Dunstanburgh's defences {{over the next}} two years. A wide range of work was carried out {{under the direction of the}} constable, Thomas of Ilderton, and the mason Henry of Holme, including blocking up the entrance in the gatehouse <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> keep. In 1384 a Scottish army attacked the castle but they lacked siege equipment and were unable to take the defences. Gaunt lost interest in the property after he gave up his role as the Lieutenant of the Marches. Dunstanburgh Castle remained part of the Duchy of Lancaster, but the Duchy was annexed to the Crown when Gaunt's son, Henry IV, took the throne of England in 1399.|$|E
5|$|The {{governors}} remained {{without an}} official residence until 1919 {{when the state}} purchased a home located at 101 East 27th St., Indianapolis, for $65,000 and furnished it for an additional $20,000. It was built by Henry Kahn in 1908 and had the design of an English country house. The home had a Gothic interior with high, beamed ceilings and luxurious Wilton carpeting. After a brief renovation, the home was inhabited by the governor starting in 1919 and remained so until 1945. The building was sold {{by the state to}} the Marott Hotel, which intended <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> clubhouse, but eventually demolished it in 1962 to clear land for a parking lot.|$|E

5|$|The {{international}} {{success of}} Xenosaga Episode I prompted Namco to offer then more support, with Namco's then-Vice President Yoichi Haraguchi {{to name the}} company as a valuable development partner alongside Namco Tales Studio. A manga adaptation was written by Atsushi Baba and published through Monthly Comic Zero Sum. The manga was released by the comic's publisher Ichijinsha across three volumes between 2004 and 2006. Following the release of Episode I, a supplementary disc was created titled Xenosaga Freaks. Released on April 28, 2004, Freaks is split into four segments; a visual novel segment featuring multiple characters from the game, a minigame dubbed XenoPitten, a dictionary that explains the game's terminology, and a demo for the game's official sequel. Freaks {{was part of a}} movement with the Xenosaga series <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> multimedia franchise, with the project growing substantially larger than previously planned.|$|E

25|$|The {{complete}} {{concept and}} story {{has never been}} entirely announced by the band, and this is likely due to Wilson's intentions of attempting <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> movie, {{and not wanting to}} spoil any portions of the story.|$|E

The city's initial intent was <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> museum of Puerto Rican music. The Museum of Puerto Rican Music, however, was eventually established elsewhere in the city.|$|E
