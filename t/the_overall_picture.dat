5|$|Logarithms {{have many}} {{applications}} {{inside and outside}} mathematics. Some of these occurrences {{are related to the}} notion of scale invariance. For example, each chamber of the shell of a nautilus is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor. This gives rise to a logarithmic spiral. Benford's law on the distribution of leading digits can also be explained by scale invariance. Logarithms are also linked to self-similarity. For example, logarithms appear in the analysis of algorithms that solve a problem by dividing it into two similar smaller problems and patching their solutions. The dimensions of self-similar geometric shapes, that is, shapes whose parts resemble <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>picture</b> are also based on logarithms.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham and Rawnsley {{were soon}} ordered to staff positions. It was a {{compulsory}} order for fighter pilots {{even when the}} men considered themselves fit for operational duties. Before they departed Middle Wallop and 604, {{they had a chance}} to test the new 4-inch (10 cm) AI Mk. VIII radar which had a range of two or three miles (3–5 kilometres). The new radar was a radical improvement. All the information was displayed on a single tube. The ground echo was reduced but could still be seen on screen when flying low, but it did not interfere with <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>picture.</b> Cunningham was to take over as director of all training units from Rory Chisholm who left 604 to become a staff officer at group headquarters. Rawnsley was due to take an instructors job at 62 Operational Training Unit (OTU) at Usworth. Cunningham managed to persuade the CAS to deploy him to headquarters at No. 81 Group RAF, the training organisation for RAF Fighter Command. Rawnsley was also promoted to squadron leader and was awarded the DFC and Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM). The pair remained grounded for six months until January 1943.|$|E

40|$|Archaeologically, Jerusalem {{is one of}} {{the most}} intensively {{researched}} cities in the world. Nevertheless, the architectural history of the city resembles a puzzle of which only a fraction of the pieces are known, which, in addition, belong to different historical levels. Since 1838, numerous archaeological investigations have taken place. The most important breakthrough discoveries were made by the excavations of Kathleen Kenyon, Benjamin Mazar, Nahman Avigad and Yigal Shiloh. Although all four have only published preliminary, roughly sketched initial reports, on the basis of their results an <b>overall</b> <b>picture</b> of <b>the</b> pre-Hellenistic history of the city was developed in the 1970 s and 1980 s, possessing an almost canonical status for a long time. The final excavation reports have only been published in recent years – still incomplete – and show findings which do not fit into <b>the</b> established <b>overall</b> <b>picture.</b> Added to this, there have been new excavations, especially by Ronny Reich, Eli Shukron, Doron Ben-Ami, and Yana Tchekhanovets, which are likely to call <b>the</b> current <b>overall</b> <b>picture</b> into question even further. Therefore not only survey-archaeological investigations into the settlement history of the western Jordanian hillcountry and the readjustment of pottery chronology, but also and especially these new findings in Jerusalem itself make a revision of <b>the</b> conventional <b>overall</b> <b>picture</b> necessary.

Catholics, however, were still more likely than Protestants to be unemployed and there were emerging areas of Protestant under-representation in the public sector, most notably in health and education at many levels including professional and managerial.

25|$|JPEG uses a lossy form of {{compression}} {{based on}} the discrete cosine transform (DCT). This mathematical operation converts each frame/field of the video source from the spatial (2D) domain into the frequency domain (a.k.a. transform domain). A perceptual model based loosely on the human psychovisual system discards high-frequency information, i.e. sharp transitions in intensity, and color hue. In the transform domain, the process of reducing information is called quantization. In simpler terms, quantization is a method for optimally reducing a large number scale (with different occurrences of each number) into a smaller one, and the transform-domain is a convenient representation of the image because the high-frequency coefficients, which contribute less to <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>picture</b> than other coefficients, are characteristically small-values with high compressibility. The quantized coefficients are then sequenced and losslessly packed into the output bitstream. Nearly all software implementations of JPEG permit user control over the compression-ratio (as well as other optional parameters), allowing the user to trade off picture-quality for smaller file size. In embedded applications (such as miniDV, which uses a similar DCT-compression scheme), the parameters are pre-selected and fixed for the application.|$|E

25|$|Within close {{proximity}} of Wentbridge reside several notable landmarks relating to Robin Hood. One such place-name location {{occurred in a}} cartulary deed of 1422 from Monkbretton Priory, which makes direct reference to a landmark named Robin Hood's Stone, which resided upon {{the eastern side of}} the Great North Road, a mile south of Barnsdale Bar. The historians Barry Dobson and John Taylor suggested that on the opposite side of the road once stood Robin Hood's Well, which has since been relocated six miles north-west of Doncaster, on the south-bound side of the Great North Road. Over the next three centuries, the name popped-up all over the place, such as at Robin Hood's Bay near Whitby Yorkshire, Robin Hood's Butts in Cumbria, and Robin Hood's Walk at Richmond Surrey. Robin Hood type place-names occurred particularly everywhere except Sherwood. The first place-name in Sherwood does not appear until the year 1700. The fact that the earliest Robin Hood type place-names originated in West Yorkshire is deemed to be historically significant because, generally, place-name evidence originates from the locality where legends begin. <b>The</b> <b>overall</b> <b>picture</b> from the surviving early ballads and other early references indicate that Robin Hood was based in the Barnsdale area of what is now South Yorkshire, which borders Nottinghamshire.|$|E
500|$|Although angler {{effects are}} {{sometimes}} disregarded in <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>picture</b> today, recent population {{studies have shown}} that while all year classes are well represented up to the minimum legal angling size (now 60centimetres in most states), above that size, numbers of fish are dramatically reduced {{almost to the point of}} non-existence in many waters. Some emphasis has been made of the results of two small surveys which suggested a majority of Murray cod are released by anglers. However, there are valid questions as to the representativeness of these surveys, these surveys do not explain the dramatic disappearance of large numbers of young Murray cod at exactly the minimum size limit, and most importantly, any emphasis on these surveys miss the fundamental point — as a large, long-lived species with relatively low fecundity and delayed sexual maturity wild Murray cod populations are extremely vulnerable to overfishing, even with only modest angler-kill. A tightening of fishing regulations for wild Murray cod, as referred to above, and a switch by fishermen to a largely catch and release approach for wild Murray cod would alleviate this problem. Recognising these issues, in late 2014 the New South Wales and Victorian fishery departments amended their regulations so that a slot limit of 55 to 75cm now applies in these states. (I.e. Only Murray cod between 55 and 75cm may be taken; those above and below this size range or [...] "slot" [...] must be released.) This measure should have positive effects for the Murray cod population by protecting and increasing the proportion of large breeding Murray cod.|$|E

2500|$|The key {{parameter}} {{which allows}} one to calculate the effects of BBN is the baryon/photon number ratio, which is {{a small number of}} order 6 x 10−10. This parameter corresponds to the baryon density and controls the rate at which nucleons collide and react; from this it is possible to calculate element abundances after nucleosynthesis ends. Although the baryon per photon ratio is important in determining element abundances, the precise value makes little difference to <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>picture.</b> Without major changes to the Big Bang theory itself, BBN will result in mass abundances of about 75% of hydrogen-1, about 25% helium-4, about 0.01% of deuterium and helium-3, trace amounts (on the order of 10−10) of lithium, and negligible heavier elements. [...] That the observed abundances in the universe are generally consistent with these abundance numbers is considered strong evidence for the Big Bang theory.|$|E
