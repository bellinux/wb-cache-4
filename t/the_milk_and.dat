25|$|The {{classical}} rabbis only considered {{milk and}} meat cooked together biblically forbidden, but Jewish {{writers of the}} Middle Ages also forbade consumption of anything merely containing the mixed tastes of milk and meat. This included, for example, meat that had been soaked in milk for an extended period. The prohibition against deriving benefit, on the other hand, was seen as being more nuanced, with several writers of the late Middle Ages, such as Moses Isserles and David Segal, arguing that this restriction only applied to <b>the</b> <b>milk</b> <b>and</b> meat of g'di, not to the much wider range of milks and meats prohibited by the rabbis; other prominent medieval rabbis, like Solomon Luria, disagreed, believing that the prohibition of deriving benefit referred to mixtures of all meats and milks.|$|E

2500|$|Women's {{historians have}} debated {{the impact of}} the Industrial Revolution and {{capitalism}} generally on the status of women. Taking a pessimistic view, Alice Clark argued that when capitalism arrived in 17th century England, it made a negative impact on the status of women as they lost much of their economic importance. Clark argues that in 16th century England, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms, and in operating some trades and landed estates. For example, they brewed beer, handled <b>the</b> <b>milk</b> <b>and</b> butter, raised chickens and pigs, grew vegetables and fruit, spun flax and wool into thread, sewed and patched clothing, and nursed the sick. Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labor with the husband taking paid labor jobs outside the home, and the wife reduced to unpaid household work. Middle-class women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on more powerful women. In a more positive interpretation, Ivy Pinchbeck argues that capitalism created the conditions for women's emancipation. [...] Louise Tilly and Joan Wallach Scott have emphasized the continuity and the status of women, finding three stages in European history. In the preindustrial era, production was mostly for home use and women produce much of the needs of the households. The second stage was the [...] "family wage economy" [...] of early industrialization, the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members, including husband, wife and older children. The third or modern stage is the [...] "family consumer economy," [...] in which the family is the site of consumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption.|$|E
