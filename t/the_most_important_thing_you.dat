A thing is what it is, it is itself. There can be no contradictions. In reality, contradictions cannot exist. To believe in them you must abandon <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> possess: your rational mind. The wager for such a bargain is your life.

There is many a thing which I would {{rather die than}} do--then you would answer like valiant and righteous folk; and may God give you grace to keep in the same mind, and to hold your good {{resolution}} to the last. But you, too, will agree that, except doing your duty, life is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> have. The mother, when she sacrifices her life to save her child, shews thereby how valuable she holds the child's life to be; so valuable that she will give up even her own to save it.|$|E

5000|$|This {{innovative}} form {{of self-defense}} combined street fighting, some martial arts techniques, {{and a great}} deal of non-physical strategy that pre-figured Medea’s conflict resolution theories. That strategy was based on both her street fighting experiences and her martial arts training. Medea's focus on analyzing a conflict situation has remained at the forefront of her work throughout her career. As she later said in an interview in the Chicago Reader, [...] "The basic mentality behind Chimera is you think and you keep thinking and you do not let someone psych you out. You need physical skills, but your brain is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> have." [...] Against Rape was the primary text for the self-defense courses of Chimera, Inc., for more than a decade. The Chimera program expanded to six states and trained upwards of 50,000 students.|$|E

To believe in a contradiction is to abdicate your belief in the {{existence}} of the world around you {{and the nature of the}} things in it, to instead embrace any random impulse that strikes your fancy - to imagine something is real simply because you wish it were. A thing is what it is, it is itself. There can be no contradictions. Faith is a device of self-delusion, a sleight of hand done with words and emotions founded on any irrational notion that can be dreamed up. Faith is the attempt to coerce truth to surrender to whim. In simple terms, it is trying to breath life into a lie by trying to outshine reality with the beauty of wishes. Faith is the refuge of fools, the ignorant, and the deluded, not of thinking, rational men. In reality, contradictions cannot exist. To believe in them you must abandon <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> possess: your rational mind. The wager for such a bargain is your life.

If so, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> should do *NOW * is start maintaining an “AboutMe” document that is nothing but a giant list of your qualifications (or a reminder of the gaps in your qualifications that need attention). This is not a resume. An “AboutMe” document is for your own record keeping, so don’t worry about fancy formatting. Simply enter information (with dates) as you proceed through your education and career. When you need to write a resume, you can refer to your “AboutMe ” document {{to make sure that you}} don’t forget anything that is important to your prospective employer. If you start collecting this information only a month or two before you need a job, it will be too late. Frequently update your “AboutMe ” document, and take corrective action if you’re weak in any category. Your “AboutMe ” document should cover the areas listed below (adapted from the 2009 National Defense Fellowship Application as well as numerous employment application forms). When you add items in each section, you should list them in reverse chronological order (i. e., most recent first) since that’s the way that they should be listed in a résumé.
