Remix" [...] of the song was released as the third single on August 23, 1999.

It also omits the lines [...] "Lovin' you means so much more, more <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> ever loved before". The music video was directed by Nigel Dick, and featured actors Melissa Joan Hart and Adrian Grenier.|$|E
500|$|Cobain {{said the}} song was {{inspired}} by documentaries about children with cancer. He told biographer Michael Azerrad, [...] "Anytime I think about it, it makes me sadder <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> can think of." [...] Azerrad asserted in his biography [...] that despite Cobain's explanation, the song actually appeared to be about Courtney Love. Charles Cross wrote in his Kurt Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven that with the lyric [...] "I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black", the frontman [...] "sang in {{what has to be}} the most convoluted route any songwriter undertook in pop history to say 'I love you'". After a performance of the song by singer Lana Del Rey in 2012, Courtney Love asserted on Twitter that the song is about her vagina. The tweets were deleted shortly after. Cobain said that the song's chorus of [...] "Hey/Wait/I've got a new complaint" [...] was him giving an example of how he was perceived by the media.|$|E
500|$|The reviews {{have stood}} the test of time and the season still remains a huge {{critical}} favorite. Entertainment Weekly reviewing the tenth season of the show acknowledged that, [...] "the second season is still the show’s best season to date." [...] The site added, [...] "I do want to talk about what season 10 could learn from what I believe is the show’s best season to date: season 2." [...] calling in all the signature elements of the show that it did the best with listing all the best moments from the season, [...] "the elevator", [...] "the walkway", [...] "Joe’s bar, [...] " [...] Meredith’s [...] "Pick me" [...] speech". and the [...] "memorable patients" [...] adding, [...] " [...] I want two people stuck on a pole (Into You Like a Train) or two Amish best friends having to say goodbye, and I want those stories to be given ample time to resonate.

500|$|Executive Producer Sara Colleton {{said it was}} {{difficult}} to kill off a long-standing character, but they felt [...] "this is where Dexter needed to be taken". She also felt the motives for Arthur killing Rita were deliberately made to be open to various interpretations, including that Arthur may have killed her [...] "in a bizarre way to trigger Dexter to deal with who he really is".s Season 5 Jump Ahead in Time? |work=TV Guide |date=December 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 20, 2009}} When asked whether Arthur told Rita about Dexter's secret life before killing her, Phillips said the answer had not been determined because the fifth season was not yet planned, but he added, [...] "I would think that he did not tell her". Michael C. Hall called the ending a [...] "really bold stroke" [...] that would reset the stage of the series just as the Dexter Morgan character began to feel he could live with an emotional connection to his wife and family. Hall also said of the ending, [...] "More <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> felt for the audience. I think {{this is the kind of}} thing that's really going to tie people in knots." ...|$|E
500|$|However, some reviewers {{felt the}} film relied {{too heavily on}} gadgets and special effects, with the plot being neglected. James Berardinelli of Reelviews.net said, [...] "This is a train wreck of an action film – a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to {{force-feed}} James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs." [...] Of the action sequences, he said, [...] "Die Another Day {{is an exercise in}} loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects. The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> have seen in a major motion picture. Coupled with lousy production design, Die Another Day looks like it was done on the cheap. Gary Brown of the Houston Community Newspapers also described the weak point of the film as [...] "the seemingly non-stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string." [...] Roger Moore remarked, [...] "I thought it just went too far – and that’s from me, the first Bond in space! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage? Please!" ...|$|E
500|$|The final {{took place}} on August 16, at 10:10 CST. Before the race, Milorad Čavić made {{headlines}} by saying {{in an interview that}} it would be better for swimming if he beat Phelps. Phelps' coach Bob Bowman used the quote to provide motivation to his protégé. In an interview, Phelps said that doubters like Čavić [...] "fires me up more <b>than</b> <b>anything,</b> <b>I</b> always welcome comments. It definitely motivates me even more." [...] Almost immediately after the race started, Čavić took the lead with Phelps getting off to a slow start. At the turn, Čavić was first, followed by Ian Crocker, while Phelps made the split in seventh place, just 0.62 seconds behind Čavić. As the two approached the finish, Čavić tried to coast to the wall on one last stroke, while Phelps, who had misjudged the end, took an extra half-stroke, causing both competitors to touch the wall at almost exactly the same time. It turned out that Phelps had actually finished one one-hundredth of a second ahead of Čavić, with a time of 50.58 seconds. Phelps even admitted that, at first, he thought the extra stroke he took had cost him the gold medal, until he looked at the scoreboard displaying the results. Andrew Lauterstein won the bronze medal, also beating Crocker by one one-hundredth of a second.|$|E

500|$|Singapore was a {{critical}} race in the championship as all five drivers {{had a chance to}} take the lead with a victory. The situation was made difficult for Alonso as he had used his allocation of eight engines following the Italian Grand Prix, and to replace one would incur a ten-place grid penalty. His rivals each had at least one untouched engine in reserve; Webber had two. Nevertheless, Alonso set himself the target to score points in Singapore. He also acknowledged that his car was not the fastest in the field and felt he needed five podiums in the season's five remaining races. Webber stated that he was expecting Singapore to be a tough weekend for him after he had retired from the event in 2008 and 2009, but felt there was still some time before a driver clinched the championship. [...] After crashing out of the first lap of the Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton said he would push hard to stay in the running for the championship: [...] "I'll take each race as it comes, but I'll also be making sure I get to the finish of the next five races, that's more important <b>than</b> <b>anything.</b> <b>I</b> go to Singapore to win." [...] Hamilton felt Alonso was the favourite to win the Singapore Grand Prix and viewed the Spanish driver as his main rival for the Drivers' Championship which was shared by Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. Button himself believed Alonso would have an extra advantage as the Spaniard's teammate Massa was out of contention for the title.|$|E
500|$|Heigl, who portrayed Stevens, was {{particularly}} critical of her character's relationship with O'Malley, deeming it [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl further explained her outlook on {{the progression of}} her character, [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now." [...] Former The Star-Ledger columnist Alan Sepinwall expressed a negative perspective on the episode, deeming it childish and ridiculous. He disliked Rhimes' conception of the story arc involving Stevens, elaborating, [...] "If there's a doctor on this show who should be forced to repeat their intern year, if only to prevent them from being allowed to influence younger doctors, it's Izzie, not George. She proves her unfitness for this role with her first patient of the day, the deer. Not cute, not character-illuminating, just dumb." [...] Also criticized was Torres, whose regression from a [...] "cool, rocking, outgoing, cofident and full of life" [...] role was highlighted, receiving negative feedback from Sepinwall, who wrote [...] "Now the character exists entirely so the writers can dump on her, in a devolution far worse <b>than</b> <b>anything.</b> <b>I</b> just don't get it, and it pains me to watch any scene with Callie in it. Despite expressing a negative outlook on Meredith's story arc which dealt with Shepherd, noting that the [...] "constant break-ups and reunions are as silly as if Shonda Rhimes had just kept them apart for three seasons before letting them kiss", Sepinwall was favorable of Lexie's arrival at Seattle Grace, feeling that [...] "she's still being written as Meredith circa season one in an attempt to make us like her, but I didn't mind the manipulation, if only because there are so few characters left on this show to like." [...] The Buzzsugar television reviewer was mainly critical of the episode, describing it as a departure from [...] "the old show". However, Lexie's introduction was praised in the Buzzsugar review.|$|E

2500|$|Harris {{described}} Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin, as a {{major influence}} on the characters of Uncle Remus and the Little Boy.

[...] Interpreting Uncle Tom's Cabin as a [...] "wonderful defense of slavery," [...] Harris argued that Stowe's [...] "genius took possession of her and compelled her, in spite of her avowed purpose, to give a very fair picture of the institution she had intended to condemn."

[...] Martin Gottfried wrote: [...] "The concept behind 'Follies' is theater nostalgia, representing the rose-colored glasses through which we face the fact of age ... the show is conceived in ghostliness. At its very start, ghosts of Follies showgirls stalk the stage, mythic giants in winged, feathered, black and white opulence. Similarly, ghosts of Twenties shows slip through the evening as the characters try desperately to regain their youth through re-creations of their performances and inane theater sentiments of their past." ...|$|E

Pacquiao, who has himself been known to be supportive of the Arroyo government, said that he was persuaded to run by local officials of General Santos City, who hoped he would act as a bridge between their interests and the national government.

The band leader and arranger Marl Young who worked at the club recognised her talent and signed her under contract to the then famous Club DeLisa.

She was better <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> had heard so far. She came across like a country girl, provided with a headscarf and a basket in her hand and so on; but she could sing the blues better than anyone I've heard to date. That night I asked her if I could record a record with her. We then played Kansas City and a few other blues numbers and the song So Long. She had such a wonderful sound and I remember how I always thought, 'Oh my God, and I have no record company; I can make the drive just for myself.'"
