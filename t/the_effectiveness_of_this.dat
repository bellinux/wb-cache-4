5|$|Although {{these laws}} were relaxed over time, Emperor Wu renewed the state's {{persecution}} of merchants when in 119 BCE {{he made it}} illegal for registered merchants to purchase land. If they violated this law, their land and slaves would be confiscated by the state. <b>The</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> law is questionable, since contemporary Han writers mention merchants owning huge tracts of land. A merchant who owned property worth a thousand catties of gold—equivalent to ten million cash coins—was considered a great merchant. Such a fortune was one hundred {{times larger than the}} average income of a middle class landowner-cultivator and dwarfed the annual 200,000 cash-coin income of a marquess who collected taxes from a thousand households. Some merchant families made fortunes worth over a hundred million cash, which was equivalent to the wealth acquired by the highest officials in government.|$|E
5|$|With only 4:25 {{remaining}} and a lead well in hand, Stanford {{began running}} down the clock by executing running plays, which keep the game clock running {{as long as the}} ball carrier is downed in the field of play. Three rushes gained Stanford 16yards, but <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> strategy was undermined by a 15-yard personal foul penalty against Stanford that prevented the Cardinal from gaining a first down. Stanford also accepted a delay of game penalty in order to squeeze as much time as possible from the clock before punting back to Virginia Tech. The final drive of the game began from the Tech 11-yard line with 2:10 remaining, and quarterback Taylor controlled the ball on all of its five plays. Taylor completed a five-yard pass to Coale, then ran for 18yards and a first down. He was then sacked for a 15-yard loss, but gained much of that back with an 11-yard run. On the game's final play, Taylor completed a 17-yard first-down pass to Wilson, who was tackled as the last second ticked off the clock and Stanford clinched a 40–12 victory.|$|E

25|$|The anti-convulsant drugs {{gabapentin}} and pregabalin {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} pain. Gabapentin may be of significant benefit for pain relief in about 35% of people with fibromyalgia.

Approximately 6/10 people who take gabapentin to treat pain related to fibromyalgia experience unpleasant side effects such as dizziness, abnormal walking, or swelling from fluid accumulation. Pregabalin demonstrates a substantial benefit in about 9% of people. Pregabalin reduced time off work by 0.2 days per week.|$|E
25|$|Color {{selection}} was {{by using the}} difference in the levels of three Optical filters, in order to capture these color limits: u-r ≤ 2.5 (1), r-i ≤ -0.2 (2), r-z ≤ 0.5 (3), g-r ≥ r-i + 0.5 (4), u-r ≥ 2.5 (r-z) (5).

25|$|Paradoxical {{intention}} is a cognitive reframing technique where the insomniac, instead {{of attempting to}} fall asleep at night, makes every effort to stay awake (i.e. essentially stops trying to fall asleep).

This technique has been shown to reduce sleep effort and performance anxiety and also lower subjective assessment of sleep-onset latency and overestimation of the sleep deficit (a quality found in many insomniacs).|$|E

40|$|Use of {{acupuncture}} {{to treat}} multiple sclerosis (MS) is fairly common, but little literature exists which studies its <b>effectiveness.</b> <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{paper is to}} review {{the literature on the}} use of acupuncture to treat MS. A literature search resulted in twelve peer-reviewed articles on the subject that examined the use of acupuncture to treat MS related quality of life (QoL), fatigue, spasticity, and pain. The majority of the studies were poorly designed—without control, randomization, or blinding. Description of the subjects, interventions, and outcome measures as well as statistical analysis was often lacking or minimal. Although many of the studies suggested that acupuncture was successful in improving MS related symptoms, lack of statistical rigor and poor study design make it difficult to draw any conclusions about <b>the</b> true <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> intervention in <b>the</b> MS population. Further studies with more rigorous designs and analysis are needed before accurate claims can be made as to <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> acupuncture in <b>this</b> population...|$|R

25|$|Triangular {{movement}}: This is {{a movement}} tactic that allows a safe and quick shifting of the offensive flanks while maintaining control of the ball. In a triangular play the ball is passed between three players to form a triangle. The triangle is then shifted to a different position when a new player is added. Many triangles can be created with various combinations of players {{with the intention of}} slowly moving the ball forward and never really compromising possession. This tactic works well when trying to gain control in the midfield. However, it can also be used for pure attacking purposes. <b>The</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> tactic {{lies in the fact that}} defenders are unable to quickly 'adapt' to the other attacker's style of play.|$|E

25|$|As a result, in 1763 local Delawares and Shawnees {{took part}} in Pontiac's Rebellion, an effort to drive the British out of their territory. The Indians' siege of Fort Pitt began on June 22, 1763, but the fort was too strong to be taken by force.

25|$|Even Gowen's {{anthracite}} combination, {{successful at}} maintaining profitable market prices even as depression set in, {{was not able}} to continue long in unity. Internecine squabbles and continued deteriorating business conditions all around undermined <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> pooling effort, and coal prices and revenues fluctuated year by year. The combination unraveled in August 1876, with Gowen angrily denouncing erstwhile coal pool member Asa Packer by name. Meanwhile, earlier in the year the Coal & Iron Company's retail marketing operation at Port Richmond was transferred to an independent concern. As the Philadelphia coal market continued to decline, Schuylkill County mine operators sent Thomas Baumgardner, who had given Franklin Gowen his first introduction to the coal and iron businesses during his apprenticeship, as part of a committee to get a read on Gowen's intentions. Still out of sorts over the larger anthracite combination's falling apart, Gowen would not commit to any new price-fixing arrangement.|$|E

In September–October 1943, a series of discussions occurred {{over the issue of}} beginning production of the T26E1, which was advocated by the head of the Armored Force, General Jacob Devers. Ordnance favored the 76mm gun, electrical transmission T23. Theater commanders generally favored a 76mm gun medium tank such as the T23, and were against a heavy 90mm gun tank. However, testing of the T23 at Fort Knox had demonstrated reliability problems in the electrical transmission of which most army commanders were unaware. The new 76mm M1A1 gun approved for the M4 Sherman seemed to address concerns about firepower against the German tanks. All participants in the debate were, however, unaware of the inadequacy of the 76mm gun against the frontal armor of the Panther tank, as they had not researched <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> gun against the new German tanks, which had already been encountered in combat.|$|E
