5|$|Like her {{predecessor}} Rudd, Gillard {{had said}} <b>that</b> <b>health</b> {{is a priority}} in her agenda. She announced during the 2010 election, {{that there would be}} an increase of 270 placements for emergency doctors and nurses and 3,000 extra nursing scholarships over the following 10 years. She also said mental health would be a priority in her second term, with a $277million suicide-prevention package which would target high-risk groups. As the election delivered a hung parliament, a $1.8billion package was given to rural hospitals, which was agreed to by the independents to support her re-election.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the McGill University Health Centre, McGill has been directly partnered with many teaching hospitals for decades, and also {{has a history of}} collaborating with many hospitals in Montreal. These cooperations allow the university to graduate over 1,000 students in health care each year. McGill's contract-affiliated teaching hospitals include the Montreal Children's Hospital, the Montreal General Hospital, the Montreal Neurological Hospital, the Montreal Chest Institute and the Royal Victoria Hospital which are all now part of the McGill University Health Centre. Other hospitals <b>that</b> <b>health</b> care students may use include the Jewish General Hospital, the Douglas Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital Center.|$|E

25|$|They {{also argue}} <b>that</b> <b>health</b> {{locus of control}} is better at {{predicting}} health-related behavior if studied in conjunction with health value (the value people attach to their health), suggesting <b>that</b> <b>health</b> value is an important moderator variable in the health locus of control relationship. For example, Weiss and Larsen (1990) found an increased relationship between internal health locus of control and health when health value was assessed. Despite the importance Norman and Bennett attach to specific measures of locus of control, there are general textbooks on personality which cite studies linking {{internal locus of control}} with improved physical health, mental health and quality of life in people with diverse conditions: HIV, migraines, diabetes, kidney disease and epilepsy.|$|E

25|$|This was not {{a uniquely}} Australian phenomenon. Worldwide, medical {{practice}} was shifting focus onto hospitals with the expansion of pharmaceuticals and medical and surgical interventions.

US GPs increasingly felt <b>that</b> <b>health</b> care was becoming fragmented and weakening doctor patient relationships.|$|E
40|$|Bridging the gaps: can we {{afford not}} to invest in global health? This journal, {{although}} having the prefix Scandinavian, wants to convey to its readers a contemporary global perspective on public <b>health.</b> We suggest <b>that</b> this means that we should also reflect on public health developments outside Scandinavia (which are certainly not unrelated to the development within) as well as share public health lessons from within the Scandinavian countries with the international public health community. The past year has seen a promising commitment to address the overriding public <b>health</b> issue- <b>that</b> of the <b>health</b> gap.
