We are now asked not only to acknowledge the King of England's claim to be King of Ireland, but we are asked to swear allegiance and fidelity in virtue of that claim ...

In this talk I will explain the problems, together with some things that have been tried in the past and some new ideas for their solution. Types of conceptual problems. A conceptual problem is not one which is formulated in precise technical terms and which calls for a definite answer. For this reason, there are no clear-cut criteria for their solution, but one can bring some criteria to bear. These will vary from case to case. There are three general types of conceptual problems in mathematics of which the ones that I will discuss today are examples. These are: 1 ffi<...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, {{regulatory}} thought in the UK has not fitted the strict deregulatory and regulatory dichotomy and has taken a more mature approach that is apparent in the adoption of recommendations by the Better Regulation Task Force. Therefore, we can <b>talk</b> <b>here</b> <b>about</b> a certain evolution. However, certain path dependence elements have still been present. Regulation has not been free from populist initiatives that occurred before this period, especially {{in the area of}} enforcement, nor from overreliance on previously successful solutions. An interesting aspect of regulatory initiatives adopted over this period is that they are both of an ‘integrative’ and ‘diffusive’ in character. It is difficult to speculate which theme has dominated. There are certain specific characteristics of regulation in the UK that have been preserved, but in general, regulation has often been consistent with regulatory themes in other countries, but not with academic thought. This has particular dynamics.

To motivate the research, we will address a competitive practical case in the field of telecommunications.

In this paper we propose a new objective metric to evaluate the visual quality between a mesh with a perfect quality called reference mesh and its distorted version. The proposed metric uses a chosen statistical distribution to extract parameters of two random variable sets, the first set is the dihedral angles related to the reference mesh, while the second set is the dihedral angles related to the distorted mesh. The perceptual distance between two meshes is computed as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two sets of variables. Experimental results from two subjective databases (LIRIS masking database and LIRIS/EPFL general purpose database) and comparisons with seven objective metrics cited in the state-of-the-art demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed metric in terms of the correlation to the mean opinion scores across these databases...|$|R
40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{definitions}} of control of a pest. One of the competing definitions, and probably the most common even if not accepted in advanced circles, is to kill off the pest.

A survival rate is just the complement of the mortality rate - if survival is 80 percent, then mortality is 20 percent. It happens to be more generally useful in studying populations to deal with survival rates, so I hope I may be excused not having translated everything to mortality rates as I might have done. All animals are mortal, so left to themselves their populations would dwindle to nothing except for their rates of reproduction. It is necessary to know what the natural rates of survival are in order to avoid confusing the natural decline of populations during periods of low reproduction with the supposed effect of some control measure. The trials described here are simple in concept. We have measured survival both with and without control measures with the primary purpose of comparing rates under the two conditions and then judging the efficacy of treatment from the changes in survival rates...|$|R

40|$|Although MOOCs have {{received}} the most attention in higher education this year, another issue is affecting colleges and universities and the IT community on a much broader scale: {{the perception that the}} higher education business model is “broken. ” This isn’t an IT problem by definition, but IT leaders have not contributed effectively to a solution. At least not yet. So what can we, as IT leaders, do individually and collectively to change the outcome? The answer is clear. We have to collaborate. Substantially. And in ways that are far-reaching and very challenging. We have to change our core processes and our default approach, and we have to take some calculated risks. Our institutions, and perhaps our IT community, have largely resisted these changes to this point. Something has to give, and that something is our very expensive cultural heritage of maintaining uniqueness where it doesn’t matter.

40|$|Arguably one of {{the most}} {{important}} activities of a university is to provide environments where students develop the wide variety of social and intellectual skills necessary for giving and receiving feedback. We are not <b>talking</b> <b>here</b> <b>about</b> the kinds of activity typically associated with the term “feedback ”- such as that which occurs through individual course evaluation questionnaires or more universal systems such as the National Student Survey, but the profoundly creative and human act of giving and receiving feedback in order validate, challenge and inspire. So as to emphasise we are talking about this kind of feedback, we coin the term “creative feedback ” to distinguish it from the pre-conceived rather dreary compliance-inflected notions of feedback and set out in this paper to characterise its qualities. In order to ground and motivate our definition and use of “creative feedback ” we take a historical look at the two concepts of creativity/creative and feedback. Our intention is to use this rich history to motivate both the choice two words, and the reason to bring them together. In doing so we wish to emphasise the characteristics of an educational philosophy underpinned by social interaction. By describing those qualities necessary to characterise creative feedback this paper sets out an educational philosophy for how schools, communities and universities could develop their learning environments. What we present here serves not only as a manifesto for designing learning environments generally but as a driver for designing technologies to support online social learning. Technology not only provides us with new opportunities to support such learning but also to investigate and evidence the way in which we learn and the most effective learning environments...|$|E
40|$|I {{argue that}} it would be crucial to have as many {{channels}} as possible to understand the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) in nextgeneration collider experiments. A historic example of the parity violation and the V − A interaction is used to make this point. An e − e − option offers us a new channel in this respect. The usefulness of this channel is exemplified for the case of supersymmetry and of the strongly coupled EWSB sector. 1. Why are we here? So, here is another workshop on collider physics. Specifically on a rather exotic collider option, e − e − collider. Why are we doing this, after all? The answer to this question is quite simple. We believe that the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) is the most pressing question in particle physics. And {{it is going to be}} a challenging task to completely reveal all secrets of EWSB. It will take substantial experimental and theoretical efforts to understand it. For this aim, having as many possible channels as possible will probably be necessary. Why multi-channel? We heard about the complementarity of hadron and lepton machines so many times. Maybe enough of it. And we are <b>talking</b> <b>here</b> <b>about</b> yet another possible collider option. Why bother? I would like to remind you of an example in the history of particle physics where it was crucial to attack the same problem from many different channels. It is the V − A form of the charged-current weak interaction. a The first hint for parity violation came from a purely hadronic process.

40|$|Numerous {{papers in}} the past {{indicate}} that experimental- regression obtained- alphas may {{do not have a}} physical meaning when they contradict theory. This paper will show that the key to the problem is the basic equation applied. If both the theoretical and experimental basic equations are the same then experimental alphas will have the same physical meaning. Actually, experimental alphas based on standards should have more meaning than theoretical alphas. Besides, theoretical alphas are dependent on coefficients that must be determined experimentally. So why use the left hand to reach into the right pocket when a more direct route is available. It has been shown in that for some models the alphas can be expressed as ratios of corresponding regression coefficients. In practice theoretical physicists are frequently forced back to the “drawing board ” when their theories cannot be experimentally confirmed. Besides, physicists usually use least squares fitting to link theory with experiment. One is <b>talking</b> <b>here</b> <b>about</b> the linearity in coefficients that have to be determined, and because of that, one can utilize a logarithmic scale or any other mathematical transformation prior to applying multiple linear regression.
