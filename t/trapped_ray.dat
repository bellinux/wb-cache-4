40|$|In the {{geometrical}} optics approximation, stable and unstable manifolds of periodic orbits, invariant tori, and hyperbolic invariant manifolds are shown to exist and produce trapping of bundles of light rays near {{the axis of}} a translation-invariant, axisymmetric optical fiber whose squared refractive index is a parabolic function of squared radius. Periodic symmetry-breaking perturbations in the refractive index are shown to destroy this <b>ray</b> <b>trapping</b> and to produce homoclinic tangles, through which nearby <b>trapped</b> <b>rays</b> may escape, and untrapped rays may become at least temporarily trapped. Melnikov's technique is used {{to prove that the}} perturbations cause the stable and unstable manifolds of the unperturbed periodic orbits, invariant ori, and hyperbolic invariant manifolds to develop transverse intersections and therefore, to form homoclinic tangles. These tangles imply either homoclinic haos by the Smale horseshoe mechanism and the Poincar 6 -Birkhoff-Smale theorem, or Arnol'd diffusion. In both situations, lobe dynamics will dominate phase space transport, seen here as a flux of (initially) untrapped rays passing through the trapping region. 1...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on long-time {{existence}} for quasilinear wave equations with small initial data in exterior domains.

The corresponding lifespan bound in the boundaryless case is due to Lindblad, and Du and Zhou first proved such long-time existence exterior to star-shaped obstacles.

40|$|We {{exhibit the}} form of the ``radiation field,'' {{describing}} the large-scale, long-time behavior of solutions to the wave equation on a manifold with no <b>trapped</b> <b>rays,</b> as a Fourier integral operator. We work in two different geometric settings: scattering manifolds (a class which includes asymptotically Euclidean spaces) and asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds. The canonical relation of the radiation field operator is a map from the cotangent bundle of the manifold to a cotangent bundle over the boundary at infinity; it is associated to a sojourn time, or Busemann function, for geodesic rays. In non-degenerate cases, the symbol of the operator can be described explicitly in terms of the geometry of long-time geodesic flow. As a consequence of the above result, we obtain a description of the (distributional) high-frequency asymptotics of the scattering-theoretic Poisson operator, better known as the Eisenstein function in the asymptotically hyperbolic case...|$|R

40|$|Localized energy {{estimates}} {{have become}} a fundamental tool when studying wave equations {{in the presence of}} asymptotically at background geometry. <b>Trapped</b> <b>rays</b> necessitate a loss when compared to the estimate on Minkowski space. A loss of regularity is a common way to incorporate such. When trapping is sufficiently weak, a logarithmic loss of regularity suffices. Here, by studying a warped product manifold introduced by Christianson and Wunsch, we encounter the first explicit example of a situation where an estimate with an algebraic loss of regularity exists and this loss is sharp. Due to the global-in-time nature of the estimate for the wave equation, the situation is more complicated than for the Schrödinger equation. An initial estimate with sub-optimal loss is first obtained, where extra care is required due to the low frequency contributions. An improved estimate is then established using energy functionals that are inspired by WKB analysis. Finally, it is shown that the loss cannot be improved by any power by saturating the estimate with a quasimode. Comment: 18 page...|$|R
