2500|$|Wittgenstein {{was quite}} vocal about his {{depression}} in his years at Cambridge, {{and before he}} went to war; on many an occasion, he told Russell of his woes. His mental anguish seemed to stem from two sources: his work, and his personal life. Wittgenstein made numerous remarks to Russell about logic driving him mad. Wittgenstein also stated to Russell that he [...] "felt the curse of those who have half a talent". He later expresses this same worry, and tells of being in mediocre spirits due to his lack of progress in his logical work. Monk writes that Wittgenstein lived and breathed logic, and a <b>temporary</b> <b>lack</b> of inspiration plunged him into despair. Unless he was lying, Wittgenstein tells of his work in logic affecting his mental status in a very extreme way. However, he also tells Russell another story. Around Christmas, in 1913, he writes: [...] "how can I be a logician before I'm a human being? For {{the most important thing is}} coming to terms with myself!" [...] He also tells Russell on an occasion in Russell’s rooms that he was worried about logic and his sins; also, once upon arrival to Russell's rooms one night Wittgenstein announced to Russell that he would kill himself once he left. Of things Wittgenstein personally told Russell, Ludwig’s temperament was also recorded in the diary of David Pinsent. Pinsent writes [...] "I have to be frightfully careful and tolerant when he gets these sulky fits", and [...] "I am afraid he is in an even more sensitive neurotic state just now than usual", when talking about Wittgenstein's emotional fluctuations.|$|E

40|$|The {{employment}} {{effects of}} technology, {{particularly in the}} office environment, has concerned employers, office managers, employment specialists, business educators, and women (who represent 99 percent of all secretaries and 97 percent of all typists). Technology-driven concerns have been raised regarding deskilling and decreased demand for office personnel. ^ This study analyzed technology 2 ̆ 7 s impact on employment in the office occupations, as reflected by demands of employers hiring office temporaries. Questionnaires were sent to 598 temporary help headquarter firms nationwide affiliated with the National Association of Temporary Services to determine specific job skills and training of office temporary workers; 263 usable responses were received. ^ The study found that office technology has resulted in neither decreased demand nor deskilling of office workers. Office clerical/automation workers, predicted to be the fastest-growing temporary help occupational segment in the future, were currently most demanded by employers. ^ The demographic profile of the typical office temporary was a white female, 25 - 34 years old, with 1 - 2 years 2 ̆ 7 postsecondary education. Office workers sought temporary employment to schedule work flexibly, supplement income, explore jobs, acquire experience, and seek employment variety. ^ Word processing positions commanded the highest salaries and were most demanded by employers. Although less than one-half of firms provided office automation training, word processing was the primary training offered. The use of IBM or compatible products and WordPerfect, Displaywrite, WordStar, Multimate Advantage, and Microsoft Word software was preferred over simulated equipment and software. Spreadsheet and database training ranked second and third, respectively, with Lotus and dBase the preferred spreadsheet and database packages. ^ Although employers will continue to require traditional office skills (with the exception of shorthand) in the future, familiarity with newer, sophisticated office innovations (i. e., word processing, spreadsheet, database, modems, networks, desktop publishing, facsimile) will be increasingly demanded. The study found, however, that entry-level office <b>temporaries</b> <b>lacked</b> these skills. ^ Specific recommendations regarding the nature and content of office automation training, educational implementation of such training, and future research regarding the office automation segment of the temporary help industry are identified. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of standing water habitat for amphibians is widely known and recognized. However, in some arid or semiarid zones {{the availability of}} these temporal habitats is uncertain and fluvial habitats could play {{a very important role}} for amphibian conservation. For example, in the Mediterranean region many fluvial habitats have a <b>temporary</b> character, <b>lacking</b> predatory fish populations and hosting diverse amphibian communities. To compare the relative {{importance of}} various fluvial and still water habitats, we studied the breeding amphibian community over a wide area from 2006 to 2008 in southwestern Spain. All amphibian species found in the area were present in lotic habitats and the highest amphibian diversity was found in temporary stream habitats. Fluvial habitats were among the most important habitats used for reproduction by eight amphibian species of conservation concern, whereas for seven species a significant positive selection was found towards one or several fluvial habitat types as reproduction habitats. The conservation of fluvial habitats including rigorous impact assessments and management programs can be very important for the conservation of endangered amphibians in these semi-arid areas.

30|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the emergency physicians' lack of time and the <b>temporary</b> physicians' <b>lack</b> of knowledge to supervise surgical treatment issues was that the junior physicians, especially those who solve tasks in the emergency room, got less supervision. “You act a bit like a cowboy (…) Also, you know that if you have done something that is absolute nonsense, then they will discover it at the conference (an orthopedic consultant reviews all the X-rays), and the patient is called in the next day. You have a safety net, so to speak” (Interview, junior physician, January 2016). On weekends, the capacity changes, and it becomes harder to match the capacity (physician) with the task (treatment of the patient). Sometimes the result is “rework.” The failure probability of a work item, here the wrong treatment of a patient, depends on the complexity of the activity and the match between the skill requirement and the responsible physician’s range of skills. The junior physician making a decision beyond his competences will trigger an exception report process and new decisionmaking. Failed work items need rework to maintain quality, in this case re-treatment (Jin and Levitt 1996).|$|R

Nevertheless, in extreme hard working conditions of the tribological systems (high pressures, velocities and temperatures, <b>temporary</b> lubricating <b>lack</b> during starting) the machine elements are not secured enough. Consequently the idea to introduce the additional substance- operating preparation into tribological systems (with the lubricating oils) appeared a few years ago. Owing to that, the lubricating oils with better antiwear and antiseizure properties are obtained. The boundary layers created on cooperating elements surfaces are able to carry bigger load and also friction resistance and wear of these elements decrease. The paper presents literature review concerning the operating preparations used in lubricating oils. Different opinions about operating preparations functioning {{can be found in the}} professional literature- from harmfulness or weak effectiveness to good efficiency and big technical, economical and ecological meaning. In author’s opinion, in extreme working conditions of tribological systems the operating preparations (especially the chemical interaction preparations) ensure additional and effective protection of machine elements. The functioning efficiency of the operating preparations is usually the highest in case of deteriorating technical condition of tribological system elements...|$|R
5000|$|According {{to several}} scholars, the term [...] "Catalan" [...] and [...] "Catalonia" [...] emerged {{near the end}} of the 11th century and {{appeared}} in the Usatges of 1150.

While the <b>temporary</b> <b>lack</b> of foreign invasions contributed to Catalonia's stability, it was not a major cause. Rather, it provided a zone for sociopolitical development. For example, after the County of Barcelona signed an agreement with the Kingdom of Aragon, to create the Crown of Aragon in 1137 through a dynastic union, the system was designed to mutually check both the king's and the nobility's powers, while the small but growing numbers of free citizens and bourgeoisie would tactically take sides with the king in order to diminish typically feudal institutions.|$|E

The division was part of XII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Andrew Thorne, but he was replaced in April 1941 by Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery, who soon noted Lloyd as a promising officer. In later life Lloyd would sometimes write nostalgically to former colleagues about the gruelling regime of physical fitness (“100% Binge” and “Binge, More Binge & Great Binge”) which Montgomery expected of all those under his command, irrespective of rank. Montgomery was promoted to command South-Eastern Command at Reigate (he soon renamed it “South Eastern Army”) and on 18 December 1941 Lloyd was posted to join him. By 1942 Lloyd was a lieutenant colonel (GSO1) on the staff. He wanted to see fighting, and was disappointed not to be posted to Egypt with Montgomery when the latter took command of the Eighth Army in August 1942.

The system of [...] "extra police" [...] did not work well, partly because it was often a <b>temporary</b> position <b>lacking</b> job security, {{making it difficult to}} recruit and retain skilled personnel. Subsequently, the Riksdag adopted the first Police Act in 1925. The act essentially codified structures already in place, but also introduced a more unified police and better working conditions for the police officers. Officers began wearing the same dark-blue uniforms nationwide, with the same weapons and helmets. Local ties remained strong, however, with 554 small districts that had great freedom to organize police work as before, even though the State now had the power to issue a number of regulations about everything from the leadership to the duties of the police. There were still some problems maintaining order when larger crowds gathered, as evidenced by the Ådalen shootings in 1931, where the military was called in as reinforcement during a violent labor dispute, killing five. In rural areas, the detective work were also often rudimentary. Accordingly, the Swedish State Police (statspolisen) was established in 1932, which would complement the municipal police.|$|R
