5|$|Following the Dunkirk {{evacuation}} in 1940, Britain faced {{a shortage}} of weapons. In particular, there was a severe scarcity of anti-tank weapons, many of which had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> in France. One of the few resources not in short supply was petroleum oil since supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|Shana formulates a {{countermeasure}} and {{is ultimately}} successful in adding a single law to Xanadu where the Denizens {{are not allowed}} to eat humans anymore. With Xanadu created, the Denizens depart to the new world, soon followed by hundreds of Flame Haze determined to help enforce order on it. Yuji intends to go to Xanadu alone and make sure humans and Denizens can eventually learn to coexist, but Shana refuses <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind.</b> In the end, Yuji accepts Shana's feelings and the two kiss, which activates a spell left to Yuji by Crimson Lord Lamia that restores his existence, so Yuji is no longer a Torch. With the help of another spell from Lamia, Yuji successfully restores all humans in Misaki City whose existence was absorbed by the Denizens before he and Shana depart for Xanadu together.|$|E
5|$|The {{preservation}} of these fossils {{is one of}} their great fascinations to science. As soft-bodied organisms, they would normally not fossilize and, unlike later soft-bodied fossil biota such as the Burgess Shale or Solnhofen Limestone, the Ediacaran biota is not found in a restricted environment subject to unusual local conditions: they were a global phenomenon. The processes that were operating must have been systemic and worldwide. There was something very different about the Ediacaran Period that permitted these delicate creatures <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> and it is thought the fossils were preserved by virtue of rapid covering by ash or sand, trapping them against the mud or microbial mats on which they lived. Their preservation was possibly enhanced by the high concentration of silica in the oceans before silica-secreting organisms such as sponges and diatoms became prevalent. Ash beds provide more detail and can readily be dated to the nearest million years or better using radiometric dating.|$|E

5|$|There {{were also}} {{women in the}} Gold Rush. However, their numbers were small. Of the 40,000 people who arrived by ship in the San Francisco harbor in 1849, only 700 were women. They held various roles {{including}} prostitutes, single entrepreneurs, married women, poor and wealthy women. They were of various ethnicities including Anglo-American, African-American, Hispanic, Native, European, Chinese, and Jewish. The reasons they came varied: some came with their husbands, refusing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> to fend for themselves, some came because their husbands sent for them, and others came (singles and widows) for the adventure and economic opportunities. On the trail many people died from accidents, cholera, fever, and myriad other causes, and many women became widows before even setting eyes on California. While in California, women became widows quite frequently due to mining accidents, disease, or mining disputes of their husbands. Life in the goldfields offered opportunities for women to break from their traditional work.|$|E
5|$|After the British had {{departed}} Tug Argan, the Italians swiftly began {{to bring a}} close to their operations in Somaliland. Units of the Black Watch, 2nd Battalion King's African Rifles, and the 1/2 Punjab Regiment formed a small rearguard at Barakasan, which fought gamely into the night of 17 August to buy the main force time to evacuate. The Royal Navy {{had already begun to}} evacuate military personnel from Berbera on 16 August, operations that were not interfered with, possibly due to uncertainty about whether a peace treaty might be signed in the near future. By 19 August, all military forces, including the rearguard, the remainder of which had embarked late the previous day, had been evacuated by sea. An estimated 5,300–5,700 troops in total were evacuated to Aden. Italian forces, who had been held up by naval bombardment by HMS Ceres on 17 August, arrived in an empty Berbera on the 19th, effectively completing their conquest of British Somaliland. In total, Britain had suffered extremely light casualties, with 38 dead, 102 wounded, and 120 missing; however 10 artillery pieces had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> and were captured by the Italians. In comparison, Italy paid dearly for the province, suffering 465 deaths and 1530 wounded.|$|E
5|$|With {{the start}} of the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, which began on 22 June 1941, Fegelein saw active service on the Eastern Front. His unit was assigned on the 87th Infantry Division on 23 June to cover a gap in the lines of the 9th Army near Białystok. The motorized elements of the 1st SS Cavalry reached the right flank of the operational area on 24 June, but the mounted elements were unable to maintain the pace. The exhausted horses had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> and the men transported to the combat zone in lorries, while the horse-drawn artillery pieces were towed using any available vehicles. The first units to arrive crossed the Narew near Wizna and engaged the Soviets but were unable to break through. They were ordered to retreat and move further north. Infantry elements of the 87th Division captured Osowiec Fortress on 26 June, and Fegelein's cavalry was sent on a reconnaissance mission to the south-east. Himmler, not keen to have his SS units under Wehrmacht control or used in combat other than as reserves, withdrew the SS cavalry from control of the 87th Division on 27 June. The ambitious Fegelein stressed in his reports that he believed his unit was combat ready and had played a bigger role in the operation than they actually had. Ten of his men received the Iron Cross, Second Class for their efforts, and Fegelein was awarded the Iron Cross, First Class.|$|E

25|$|He {{intended}} to flank Curtis and attack his rear, forcing Curtis to retreat north or be encircled and destroyed. Van Dorn had ordered his army to travel light so each soldier carried only three days' rations, forty rounds of ammunition, and a blanket.

25|$|In the U.S. {{only about}} one crematory per year {{was built in the}} late 19th century. As {{embalming}} became more widely accepted and used, crematories lost their sanitary edge.

They started building crematories with stained-glass windows and marble floors with frescoed walls. By 2008, the cremation rate was 36.2% and was growing about 1 percentage point a year, according to CANA. CANA is the largest organization representing crematories and funeral homes in the U.S. and Canada.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} years of World War II, Rabbi Elya Meir Bloch and Rabbi Chaim Mordechai Katz were in the United States on a fund raising mission. As the war broke out, their only option to ensure the {{longevity}} of the Yeshiva was to transfer the whole yeshiva to American soil. In October 1940, a group of students led by Rabbi Chaim Stein escaped from war-ravaged Lithuania as it was overrun by the Nazis. This daring flight took place on the Sabbath. While travel is ordinarily prohibited on the Sabbath, one must transgress this prohibition in order to save lives and escape great peril. The original faculty, their families and most of the student body who chose <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> in Europe, were killed in Lithuania by Nazi forces and Lithuanian collaborators.|$|E

25|$|The Armistice of Mudros, the {{subsequent}} occupation of İstanbul, and the incompetence {{of the government}} in İstanbul had important effects on the school. As the school was given only 2 days to evacuate the building by the commander of the occupying forces, most of the valuable library and the educational material had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind.</b> The school was not able to find a suitable building for a long time, and some students continued their education in different buildings, sometimes in different schools. Nonetheless, the faculty was still very strong and many of the teachers, such as Hasan Ali Yücel, Mazhar Nedim, Memduh Şevket Esendal, would become the prominent figures and/or leaders that contributed to the shaping of the society, ideological basis, and the governance of the Republic of Turkey. Some of the students and many alumni would join Atatürk in his struggle for independence at very early stages, and some would lose their lives during the battles.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 19 August 1852, Atlantic left Buffalo, heading for Detroit, {{under the command of}} Captain J. Byron Pettey. Every cabin was full, and over 250 passengers were on the deck, many Norwegian, Irish, or other European immigrants. Atlantic stopped at Erie, Pennsylvania to pick up even more Norwegian immigrants waiting for ships to take them west to Detroit. Around half of the immigrants waiting were taken aboard; roughly seventy had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> due to lack of space. Atlantic was now dangerously overcrowded, with 500-600 people aboard; the ship's clerk did not keep an exact count. Baggage was piled on the deck, and passengers stayed wherever they could, including on the uppermost hurricane deck and the roof of Atlantic cabin. At 11 pm on 19 August Atlantic left Erie. The lake was calm; the sources are unclear about the level of visibility, with reports indicating everything from a light mist to a heavy fog.|$|E
25|$|Yorck sent a {{dispatch}} to Blücher expressing doubt {{whether he could}} join Sacken at Montmirail because his soldiers were too worn out to march {{on the night of}} 10–11 February. Instead, Yorck promised to move south to Viffort on the road to Montmirail. When he received his orders, Sacken destroyed the bridge at La Ferté-sous-Jouarre and began marching east at 9:00 pm on the 10th. By 9:00 am the following day, Russian corps commander's leading elements were clashing with French patrols east of Viels-Maisons. The French had driven Sacken's Cossacks under Akim Akimovich Karpov out of Montmirail early that morning. At 9:00 am Yorck reached Viffort and was skirmishing with French cavalry. With the La Ferté-sous-Jouarre bridge broken to the west and unknown forces looming to the east, Sacken was in serious danger of becoming trapped. Understanding this, Yorck sent a staff officer to his Russian colleague to warn him that his Prussians would be late to the battlefield. Due to the muddy roads, the heavy Prussian field guns and a brigade had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind.</b> Yorck's messenger recommended that Sacken retreat north to Château-Thierry.|$|E
