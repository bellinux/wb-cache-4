40|$|Overview: Optical {{turbidity}} sensors, optical <b>transmissometers,</b> and acoustic backscatter sensors {{have been}} well entrenched in the monitoring of suspended sediments. However, definitive results published recently by (Sutherland, 2000) note the two difficulties with turbidity sensors: the calibration is changed whenever grain size changes, and further, calibration also changes significantly with particle color. Similarly, a survey by (Davies-Colley, 2001) notes that <b>transmissometers</b> also change calibration with grain size, and have upper size cut-offs, (Voss, 1993). These results confirm what is expected from Mie’s classic theory of light scattering by spheres. Acoustics usually operate at frequencies where a/λ << 1, (a is grain radius and λ is acoustic wavelength) where scattering varies as volume-squared, again not suitable for a mixture of grain sizes. In contrast to these 3, laser diffraction methods measures multi-angle scattering at small angles from which size-distribution and concentration is computed. Measurements of concentration, TSS, are unaffected by changes in grain size or color (refractive index). The technique is widely used in industry. The present authors pioneered its use in the aquatic environment.

Our results, given in Figure 6, confirm this statement. Nevertheless, the influence of other hydrometeors like rain, snow, and rain with snow as well as their combination with fog should also be taken into account because they may significantly reduce the atmospheric visibility [14]. Visibility measurements are carried out routinely at many meteorological stations and airports by means of <b>transmissometers</b> or diffusiometers. These measurements do not differentiate between fog-only events and the combinations of fog with the other hydrometeors. However, this visibility data is usually used for the conversion of visibility to fog attenuation. Several common methods [3 – 7] can be used for the conversion.|$|R

50|$|A <b>transmissometer</b> is an {{instrument}} for measuring the extinction coefficient of the atmosphere, and for the determination of visual range. It operates by sending a narrow, collimated beam of energy (usually a laser) through the propagation medium. A narrow field of view receiver at the designated measurement distance determines how much energy is arriving at the detector, and determines the path transmission and/or extinction coefficient. Atmospheric extinction is wavelength dependent phenomenon, but the most common wavelength in use for transmissometers is 550 nm, {{which is in the}} middle of the visible waveband, and allows a good approximation of visual range.|$|E

40|$|A major {{detrimental}} effect of fog is visibility limitation which {{can result in}} serious transportation accidents, traffic delays and therefore economic damage. Existing monitoring techniques including satellites, <b>transmissometers</b> and human observers – suffer from low spatial resolution, high cost or lack of precision when measuring near ground level. Here we show a novel technique for fog monitoring using wireless communication systems. Communication networks widely deploy commercial microwave links across the terrain at ground level. Operating at frequencies of tens of GHz they are affected by fog and are, effectively, an existing, spatially world-wide distributed sensor network that can provide crucial information about fog concentration and visibility. Fog monitoring potential is demonstrated for a heavy fog event {{that took place in}} Israel.

40|$|Visibility {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parameters for meteorological observation and numerical weather prediction (NWP). It is also an important factor in everyday life, mainly for surface and air traffic especially in the Aeronautical Meteorology. The visibility decides the taking off and landing of aircraft. If the airport visibility is lower than requirement for aircraft taking off stipulated by International Civil Aviation Administration, then the aircraft must be parked at the airport. So the accurate measurement of visibility is very important. Nowadays, many devices can be measured the visibility or meteorological optical range (MOR) such as Scatterometers, <b>Transmissometers</b> and visibility lidar. But there is not effective way to verify the accuracy of these devices expect the artificial visual method. We have developed a visibility testing system that can be calibration and verification these devices. The system consists of laser transmitter, optical chopper, phase-locking amplifier, the moving optic receiving system, signal detection and data acquisition system, atmospheric aerosol simulation chamber. All of them were placed in the atmosphere aerosol simulation chamber with uniform aerosol concentration. The Continuous wave laser, wavelength 550 nm, has been transmitted into the collimation system then the laser beam expanded into 40 mm diameter for compressing the laser divergence angle before modulated by optical chopper. The expanding beam transmitting in the atmosphere aerosol cabin received by the optic receiving system moving in the 50 m length precision guide with 100 mm optical aperture. The data of laser signal has been acquired by phase-locking amplifier every 5 meter range. So the 10 data points can be detected in the 50 meters guide once.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the Ocean Margin Exchange project, a multi-disciplinary study has been conducted at the shelf edge and slope of the Goban Spur {{in order to determine the}} spatial distribution, quantity and quality of particle flux, and delineate the transport mechanisms of the major organic and inorganic components. We present here a synthesis view of the major transport modes of both biogenic and lithogenic material being delivered to the open slope of the Goban Spur. We attempt to differentiate between the direct biogenic flux from the surface mixed layer and the advective component, both biogenic and lithogenic. Long-term moorings, instrumented with sediment traps, current meters and <b>transmissometers</b> have yielded samples and near-continuous recordings of hydrographic variables (current direction and speed, temperature and salinity) and light transmission for a period of 2. 5 years. Numerous stations have been occupied for CTD casts with light transmission and collection of water samples. The sedimenting material has been analysed for a variety of marker compounds including phytoplankton pigments, isotopic, biomineral and trace metal composition and microscopical analyses. These samples are augmented by seasonal information on the distribution and composition of fine particles and marine snow in the water column. The slope shows well-developed bottom nepheloid layers always present and intermediate nepheloid layers intermittently present. Concentrations are mainly in the range 50 - 130 mg m - 3 in nepheloid layers and 6 - 25 mg m - 3 in clear water. A seasonal variability in the concentration at the clear water minimum is argued to be related to seasonal variations in vertical flux and aggregate break-up in transit during summer months. It is suggested that the winter sink for this seasonal change in particulate matter involves some reaggregation and scavenging, and some conversion of particulate to dissolved organic matter. This may provide a slow seasonal pump of dissolved organic carbon to the deep ocean interior. Differences in trapped quantities at different water depths are interpreted as due to lateral flux from the continental margin. There is a major lateral input between 600 and 1050 m at an inner station and between 600 and 1440 m at an outer one. The transport is thought to be related to intermediate nepheloid layers, but those measured are too dilute to be able to supply the flux. Observed bottom nepheloid layers are highly concentrated very close to the bed (up to 5 g m - 3), with a population of large aggregates. Some of these are capable of delivering the flux seen offshore during intermittent detachment of nepheloid layers into mid-water. Concentrated bottom nepheloid layers are also able to deliver large particles with unstable phytoplankton pigments to the deep sea floor in a few tens of days. Calculated CaCO 3 fluxes are adjusted for dissolution, which is inferred from Ca/Al ratios to be occurring in the CaCO 3 -saturated upper water column where up to 80 % of the CaCO 3 resulting from primary production is dissolved...|$|R

Our starting point will be free-space transmission. Freespace transmission, generally thought of as " 100 % transmission," is the transmission that would be observed at full range in free space where there are no molecules, no aerosols, and all rays are straight. In a real atmosphere, molecules and aerosols absorb and scatter radiation, reducing the transmission below its free-space value. In addition, atmospheric gases will increase the optical index a few hundred parts per million above the free space value of unity. Such changes in the index may introduce refractive effects such a [...] ...|$|E
