The most favoured cuts of the black bear's meat are {{concentrated}} in the legs and loins. Meat from the neck, front legs and shoulders is usually ground into minced meat or used for stews and casseroles. Keeping the fat tends to give the meat a strong flavour. As black bears can have <b>trichinellosis,</b> cooking temperatures need to be high in order to kill the parasites.|$|E
25|$|Raw meats {{may also}} contain harmful parasites. As with bacteria, these parasites are {{destroyed}} during the heat processing of cooking meat or manufacturing pet foods. Some raw diet recipes call for freezing meat before serving it, which greatly reduces (but {{does not necessarily}} eliminate) extant parasites. According to a former European Union directive, freezing fish at -20°C (-4°F) for 24 hours kills parasites. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends freezing at -35°C (-31°F) for 15 hours, or at -20°C (-4°F) for 7 days. The most common parasites in fish are roundworms from the family Anisakidae and fish tapeworm. While freezing pork at -15°C (5°F) for 20 days will kill any Trichinella spiralis worm, trichinosis is rare in countries with well established meat inspection programs, with cases of trichinosis in humans in the United States mostly coming from consumption of raw or undercooked wild game. Trichinella species in wildlife are resistant to freezing. In dogs and cats symptoms of <b>trichinellosis</b> would include mild gastrointestinal upset (vomiting and diarrhea) and in rare cases, muscle pain and muscle stiffness.|$|E

According to the USDA fact sheet modern pork can be enjoyed cooked rare at 145°F (63°C) with pink in the middle.

Prevention is a primary goal (see ICTweb pages). Since {{the creation of the}} ICT, its members (more than 110 from 46 countries) have regularly gathered and worked together during meetings held every 4 years : the International Conferences on <b>Trichinellosis.</b> These conferences were held in Warsaw in 1960, in Wrocław in 1964, in Miami beach in 1972, in Poznań in 1976, in Noordwijk aan Zee, Netherlands in 1980, in Val Morin in 1984, in Alicante in 1988, in Orvieto in 1993, in Mexico City in 1996, in Fontainebleau in 2000, in San Diego in 2004 and in the Plitvice national Park in 2007. The proceedings edited after each of these conferences showed the great amount of scientific knowledge exchanged there.|$|E

50|$|Trichinella is {{the genus}} of {{parasitic}} roundworms of the phylum Nematoda that cause trichinosis (also known as <b>trichinellosis).</b> Members of this genus are often called trichinella or trichina worms.

5000|$|To prevent <b>trichinellosis,</b> an {{official}} European directive recommends the freezing of meat at [...] {{for at least}} 10 days for pieces of meat less than 25 cm in thickness.

5000|$|Trichinosis (<b>trichinellosis)</b> is {{a disease}} caused by tissue-dwelling roundworms of the species Trichinella spiralis. In the United States, the {{national}} <b>trichinellosis</b> surveillance system has documented a steady decline in the reported incidence of this disease. During 1947 to 1951, a median of 393 human cases were reported annually, including 57 trichinellosis-related deaths. During 1997-2001, the incidence decreased to a median of 12 cases annually, with no reported deaths. The decline in infection was largely associated with changes implemented by the U.S. pork industry that have resulted in reduced prevalence of Trichinella among domestic swine. [...] In the United States, Congress passed the Federal Swine Health Protection Act, restricting the use of uncooked garbage as feed stock for pigs, and creating a voluntary Trichinae Herd Certification Program. The Trichinae Herd Certification Program is a voluntary preharvest pork safety program that provides documentation of swine management practices to minimize Trichinella exposure. The goal {{of the program is}} to establish a system under which pork production facilities that follow good production practices might be certified as Trichinella-safe.In addition to the reduction in Trichinella prevalence in commercial pork, processing methods also have contributed to the dramatic decline in human <b>trichinellosis</b> associated with pork products. Through the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, the USDA has created guidelines for specific cooking temperatures and times, freezing temperatures and times, and curing methods for processed pork products to control postharvest human exposure to Trichinella. [...] Pork products meeting these guidelines are designated certified pork.|$|E

50|$|The United States {{reported}} 25 cases {{per year}} from 1991-1996, with few implicating raw or undercooked pork. Documented sources of human infection have also included game meats, such as wild boar, bear, walrus, fox, and cougar. During 1997-2001, meats other than pork {{were the most}} common source of infection, with more cases associated with home-raised pork than commercial. The decreased incidence of <b>trichinellosis</b> in the United States has resulted from changes in pork industry management standards and government regulations.|$|E
50|$|Leptospirosis was {{postulated}} as {{the cause}} of an epidemic among Native Americans along the coast of present-day Massachusetts that occurred immediately before the arrival of the Pilgrims in 1620 and killed most of the native population.

50|$|The {{best way}} to prevent <b>trichinellosis</b> is to fully cook meat. A food {{thermometer}} can verify that the temperature inside the meat is high enough.

Both medications are considered safe but {{have been associated with}} side effects such as bone marrow suppression. Their use during pregnancy or in {{children under the age of}} 2 years is poorly studied but appears to be safe. Treatment with steroids is sometimes also required in severe cases.

From 2002 to 2007, an annual average of 11 cases per year were reported in the United States; the majority were from consuming wild game or the source was unknown.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis focuses on <b>trichinellosis,</b> a food-borne zoonosis caused by a nematode of the genus Trichinella, in Thailand. The main objectives were to characterise human <b>trichinellosis,</b> determine its endemic foci and characterise factors influencing infection in humans and in the pig, which is an important domestic animal reservoir host of Trichinella. The investigations comprised (i) a retrospective review to characterise human <b>trichinellosis</b> in Thailand, (ii) a survey to characterise factors influencing <b>trichinellosis</b> in pigs and (iii) quantitative and qualitative studies to characterise the factors influencing <b>trichinellosis</b> in humans. An analysis of Thai national <b>trichinellosis</b> surveillance data between 1981 and 2008 highlighted the five northernmost provinces in the Northern Region as particularly affected with <b>trichinellosis.</b> The incidence of human <b>trichinellosis</b> in Thailand decreased significantly during this period.

Field studies focused on populations in Nan Province in the Northern Region, where specific foci of human <b>trichinellosis</b> have been observed. A survey of pig production in both lowland and highland areas in five districts of Nan Province found small-scale pig production to be predominant. Production and management practices differed significantly between lowland and highland areas. In the highland areas, pig production was mainly for the owners’ own use. The holdings were poorly managed compared with those in lowland areas. A survey of <b>trichinellosis</b> seroprevalence in these five districts showed the disease to be associated with scavenging pigs (OR = 2. 96, p = 0. 02) and older pigs (OR = 1. 02, p = 0. 02).

40|$|<b>Trichinellosis</b> is a {{helminth}} zoonosis, {{which is}} known since long, but which is emerging or re-emerging in several regions of the world. During the last years {{the number of cases}} of <b>trichinellosis</b> in pigs and man in several East-European countries has increased very much due to the breakdown of the veterinary services because of the difficult political and socio-economic situation. In several third world countries on the other hand <b>trichinellosis</b> has become more important due to the increasing number of small traditional pig farms, in which the hygienic conditions are suboptimal. Furthermore, outbreaks of human <b>trichinellosis</b> have been reported due to recently discovered new species such as T. pseudospiralis and T. papuae. Over the last 25 years horsemeat has been more important as a source of human <b>trichinellosis</b> within the European Union than pork or wild boar meat.
