I ntroduct ion Although early tests of phencyclidine [PCP; 1 -(1 -phenylcy-clohexyl) piperidine; Sernyl |] as an intravenous anesthetic (1, 2) were encouraging, the occurrence of certain unpleasant side effects (emergent delirium, prolonged confusional state, mania, convulsions, nausea, and vomiting) prevented its ac-ceptance as medicinal agent for human use. However, abuse of phencyclidine is well-known (3). This is further evidenced by the fact that, second only to marijuana, PCP is the most frequently identified substance ncountered by <b>the</b> Drug <b>Identification</b> <b>Section</b> of <b>the</b> Georgia State Crime Laboratory. Also <b>the</b> number of <b>identifications</b> of PCP in bio-logical specimens has risen from one to three per year in 1973 - 1975 to seven in 1976, 34 in 1977, and 35 in 1978.

As a result of this increased level of competition, Lo, Lin, & Yan (2007 : 1) confirm that contractors end up submitting abnormally low bid prices (to win the work) only to end up “cutting corners or raising claims” to recoup financial losses. Similar approaches by Manufacturers of Pressure Vessel equipment could be catastrophic and with ever increasing levels of Risk being transferred to these critical suppliers under post- 2008 market conditions, understanding the impact that such Risk transfer has on these suppliers is of critical importance. It was in this context that it was decided to identify Risks applicable to Manufacturers of Pressure Vessels in South Africa and to evaluate the impact that those Risks have on the pricing behaviour of Manufacturers. To support the research, the broader population of Pressure Vessel Manufacturers in South Africa was identified by evaluating various approved vendor lists from major petrochemical refineries in South Africa. Manufacturers in the final sample were selected using a convenience sampling technique based on the authors contacts within the industry and then extended through the use of snowball sampling, where additional Respondents’ were selected based on referrals from the initial Respondents. iii Secondary data from a comprehensive literature review was used in order to formulate an online questionnaire sent to the nine identified Respondents.
