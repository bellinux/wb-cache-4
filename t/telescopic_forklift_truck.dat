40|$|Abstract- <b>Forklift</b> <b>trucks</b> are a basic {{element in}} {{material}} handling {{and will help}} to control the flow of goods in the future. This paper outlines how <b>forklift</b> <b>trucks</b> with integrated RFID hardware can be deployed in warehouse IT systems. <b>Forklift</b> <b>trucks</b> {{will be able to}} communicate with management assistant systems by means of RFID and WLAN. Goods carriers like pallets and pallet cages are equipped with RFID transponders. Information about handling and processing can be locally stored on the goods carriers. A method for the measurement of the stability of communication with components integrated in <b>forklift</b> <b>trucks</b> is presented. Components, which are specifically developed for this new system architecture, are described. Economic advantages are investigated, too. I...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} determining the accidental <b>forklift</b> <b>truck</b> impact forces on steel storage racks. Based on first principles of mechanics, simple models of a loaded <b>forklift</b> <b>truck</b> and a drive-in racking structure are presented. Model masses, as well as stiffness and damping coefficients are calibrated against experimental results obtained from tests of a <b>forklift</b> <b>truck</b> and a drive-in racking structure. Comparisons between experimental results and solutions obtained from the simple mechanical models show that the simple models accurately reproduce the static and dynamic behaviours of their associated structures. Based on the drive-in rack impact test results presented in a companion paper (Gilbert and Rasmussen, submitted for publication) [1] and the simple mechanical models for drive-in racks, actual impact forces are calculated and presented. Finally, using the impact test results and the simple mechanical models, the actual motion of the <b>forklift</b> <b>truck</b> body is calculated. This motion, being a common characteristic to all drive-in racking impacts, allows impact forces to be obtained for various pallet loads, impact elevations and rack characteristics. Thus, the paper concludes with a general method for calculating forces generated under <b>forklift</b> <b>truck</b> impact. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this article}} a <b>forklift</b> <b>truck</b> model is presented, {{which has been}} {{developed}} for a real-time simulator with man-in-the-loop. The simulator has been developed {{in order to prevent}} the industrial accidents derived from the use of <b>forklift</b> <b>trucks.</b> The simulator will be used by the operators who are trying to obtain the <b>forklift</b> <b>truck</b> driving license. This way, the operator can train some situations such as load dropping, sliding or overturning that cannot be trained in a real <b>forklift</b> <b>truck</b> driving session. The simulator consists of different software components: the 3 D scene environment, the graphic engine, the <b>forklift</b> <b>truck</b> dynamic behavior model, the numerical integration module, the collision module, the driver evaluation and the simulator manager. The efficiency of overall software implementation is a very important matter that decides whether the simulator is of good quality or not. In this article a precise dynamic model presentation is made: the driven degrees of freedom of the model, the change of parameter values in execution time, the ground to wheel forces, the braking torque modeling and the “magic formulae ” parameters calculation are explained. Moreover, the approach to the mechanical equations is explained and also some numerical experiments are done with the model. Finally, some results are drawn from the numerical experiments, bot...|$|R
