5|$|One {{or more of}} the {{abdominal}} segments, starting with the sixth segment, is fused to the telson (<b>terminal</b> <b>section)</b> to form a rigid pleotelson. The first five abdominal segments each bear a pair of biramous (branching in two) pleopods (lamellar structures which serve the function of gas exchange, and in aquatic species serve as gills and propulsion), and the last segment bears a pair of biramous uropods (posterior limbs). In males, the second pair of pleopods, and sometimes also the first, are modified for use in transferring sperm. The endopods (inner branches of the pleopods) are modified into structures with thin, permeable cuticles (flexible outer coverings) which act as gills for gas exchange. In some terrestrial isopods, these resemble lungs.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland Road {{continues}} east running near Ashley {{and into}} Saginaw County. In between Ashley {{and the county}} line, the highway crosses {{a branch of the}} Great Lakes Central Railroad. M-57 follows Brady Road and crosses M-52 just west of Chesaning. Further east, the trunkline crosses another line of the Great Lakes Central. The highway follows Broad Street into town and over the Shiawassee River. On the east banks, M-57 runs along Main Street south along the river to a junction with Peet Road where it then turns east along the latter road out of town. The highway passes through more farm fields and through Layton Corners {{on the way to a}} junction with M-13 on the Saginaw–Genesee county line. At Montrose, M-57 crosses the Flint River, and a line of the Huron and Eastern Railway. Now running along Vienna Road, the trunkline meets I-75/US23 west of Clio. As it enters town, it crosses a line of the Saginaw Bay Southern Railway. This segment of the highway passes through the northernmost suburbs of Flint, and this section is where the heaviest traffic levels along the whole highway are found. As part of its maintenance duties, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks these traffic levels using a metric known as average annual daily traffic (AADT). This figure is a calculation of the average traffic volume for a segment of roadway on any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT determined that an average of 22,280vehicles used the section of M-57 through Clio daily. East of this area, the highway once again passes through rural agricultural lands on the way to its eastern terminus at M-15, one mile (1.6km) north of Otisville. This <b>terminal</b> <b>section</b> of the trunkline had the lowest traffic levels in 2009 at 3,737vehicles AADT. No section of M-57 has been listed on the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
25|$|Airtrans {{was built}} to serve 53 passenger, {{employee}} and service stations around the airport, 33 of those for passengers and employees. Each terminal contained 3 passenger stations corresponding to that terminal's section (for example, Terminal 2E Section 1) located adjacent to the lower level terminal drive. These passenger stations contained an enclosed waiting area, destination signage, two sets of bi-parting automatic doors (with room for a third) and elevators to upper level ticketing/baggage claim. In early years of operation entry to the station was gained by placing a quarter in and passing through entry turnstiles. An employee station for each <b>terminal</b> <b>section</b> was located on a separate guideway adjacent to the terminal's ramp area, and screened from passenger view. These stations were more primitive, containing an outdoor waiting area with a fence and no automatic doors preventing access to the electrified guideway.|$|E

To this end, an accurate model of the injection probe is combined with typical injection profiles recommended by automotive Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Standards, and with a distributedparameter representation of the wiring harness. The model also includes possible imbalance affecting the bus <b>terminal</b> <b>sections,</b> whose non-ideal behavior is recognized {{to be at the}} basis of bus susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. As a matter of fact, the obtained predictions prove the great sensitivity of the injected current to the degree of imbalance of the <b>terminal</b> <b>sections,</b> and indicate that, in order to derive from the test consistent information to fix possible susceptibility problems, statistical models accounting for the uncertainty associated with the involved circuit components are preferable, unless accurate characterization of the <b>terminal</b> <b>sections</b> were available...|$|R

25|$|The traps {{are very}} similar, with leaves whose <b>terminal</b> <b>section</b> {{is divided into}} two lobes, hinged along the midrib. Trigger hairs (three on each lobe in Dionaea muscipula, many more in the case of Aldrovanda) inside the trap lobes are {{sensitive}} to touch. When a trigger hair is bent, stretch-gated ion channels in the membranes of cells {{at the base of the}} trigger hair open, generating an action potential that propagates to cells in the midrib. These cells respond by pumping out ions, which may either cause water to follow by osmosis (collapsing the cells in the midrib) or cause rapid acid growth. The mechanism is still debated, but in any case, changes in the shape of cells in the midrib allow the lobes, held under tension, to snap shut, flipping rapidly from convex to concave and interring the prey. This whole process takes less than a second. In the Venus flytrap, closure in response to raindrops and blown-in debris is prevented by the leaves having a simple memory: for the lobes to shut, two stimuli are required, 0.5 to 30 seconds apart.|$|E

40|$|Ice {{originating}} {{near the}} inland ice divide {{of the ice}} sheet can reappear as marginal ice at the surface near the ice terminal in the ablation area.

The {{data suggest that the}} upper part of the Skallen <b>terminal</b> ice <b>section</b> could have originated from inland precipitation on the Shirase drainage basin during marine isotope stage (MIS) 5 e, while the upper part of Skarvsnes and Hamna <b>terminal</b> ice <b>sections</b> could have originated from inland precipitation on the Sôya drainage basin.

This model suggests that the upstream portion of the Sôya drainage basin during the glacial period (MIS 2, 3 or 4) was located to the northeast of its present location. A flow history is proposed wherein ice from the inland Shirase drainage area flowed over the present ice-divide line from the Shirase to the Sôya drainage basin during the glacial period.
