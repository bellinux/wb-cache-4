5|$|Apart {{from active}} flight, thrips, even {{wingless}} ones, {{can also be}} picked up by winds and transferred long distances. During warm and humid weather, adults may climb to the tips of plants <b>to</b> <b>leap</b> and catch air current. Wind-aided dispersal of species has been recorded over 1600km of sea between Australia and South Island of New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Asda's latest {{attempt to}} draw {{attention}} to themselves involves trying <b>to</b> <b>leap</b> on the Harry Potter bandwagon. This is just another example of their repeated efforts of appearing as Robin Hood in the face of controversy about their worldwide group, which would suggest they are perceived as more akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Loss leaders were invented by supermarkets and {{have nothing to do with}} Bloomsbury Publishing or Harry Potter and we deeply regret having been dragged into their price-wars.|$|E
5|$|Danner's {{physical}} strength extends to his legs, allowing him <b>to</b> <b>leap</b> great heights and distances. At age 10 he can leap 40 {{feet into the}} air and run faster than a train. During his freshman year in college, he easily breaks a world track record, though he actually doesn't run at his full speed. While {{in the service of the}} French Foreign Legion in World War I, he traverses thirty-seven miles round trip in just thirty minutes (a speed of about 148mph); all while carrying 2,000 pounds of food, water, and ammunition for his unit. Despite his great strength, he is still susceptible to fatigue.|$|E
50|$|Discussed in this module are {{activities}} which when applied, modify a given dunk type. Modifier-activities occur prior <b>to</b> <b>leaping</b> or while airborne. Modifiers performed prior <b>to</b> <b>leaping</b> pertain <b>to</b> {{the manner of}} approach (e.g., locomotion or standstill), angle of approach (e.g., from the baseline), distance of leap from the basket, {{the addition of a}} pass (e.g., alley-oop), or some combination thereof. Modifiers performed while airborne pertain to bodily rotation (e.g., 360°), obstruction of own vision (e.g., arm-over-the-eyes), other bodily movements superfluous of dunk type (e.g., voluntary kicking of the legs), or some combination thereof. Dunk types can also be modified with obstructions (e.g., leaping over a car or person) which influence activities both prior <b>to</b> <b>leaping</b> and while airborne.|$|R

On a standard computer keyboard, Archy uses the Alt keys as Leap keys, Backquote (`) as a Document character and Tilde (~) as a Page character.|$|R
5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper <b>to</b> <b>leap</b> over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E
5|$|Like the spinner shark, the blacktip shark {{is known}} <b>to</b> <b>leap</b> {{out of the}} water and spin three or four times about its axis before landing. Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews {{vertically}} through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also jump {{out of the water}} to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E
5|$|Mike {{continues}} to blast the shark with the impulses, causing it <b>to</b> <b>leap</b> {{out of the}} water again, igniting the bomb as Ellen steers the sailboat towards the shark while thinking back to Sean's demise, the shark's attack on Thea, and when her husband killed the first shark. The broken bowsprit impales the shark in the exact spot where the bomb is, causing it to explode on impact. The shark's corpse then sinks {{to the bottom of the}} sea. Mike then hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured, but alive and conscious, floating in the water. The four survive the harsh encounter and make it back to land. Hoagie then flies Ellen back to Amity Island.|$|E

5|$|Several of the animal's {{physical}} features are adaptions to climbing through trees. It uses its tail to assist balance and has semi-retractable claws that it uses to climb trees in its search for prey. It has semiplantigrade feet, switching between a plantigrade-like gait (when arboreal) and a digitigrade-like one (when terrestrial). The soles of its paws are nearly bare {{and covered with}} strong pads. The fossa has very flexible ankles that allow it to readily grasp tree trunks so as to climb up or down trees head first or <b>to</b> <b>leap</b> to another tree. Captive juveniles {{have been known to}} swing upside down by their hindfeet from knotted ropes.|$|E
5|$|The {{grasshopper}} nematode (Mermis nigrescens) {{is a long}} slender worm that infects grasshoppers, {{living in}} the insect's hemocoel. Adult worms lay eggs on plants and the host becomes infected when the foliage is eaten. Spinochordodes tellinii and Paragordius tricuspidatus are parasitic worms that infect grasshoppers and alter the behaviour of their hosts. When the worms are sufficiently developed, the grasshopper is persuaded <b>to</b> <b>leap</b> into a nearby body of water where it drowns, thus enabling the parasite {{to continue with the}} next stage of its life cycle, which takes place in water.|$|E
5|$|The long tail of {{the common}} thresher, the source of many fanciful tales through history, is used in a whip-like fashion to deliver incapacitating blows to its prey. This species feeds mainly on small {{schooling}} forage fishes such as herrings and anchovies. It is a fast, strong swimmer that has been known <b>to</b> <b>leap</b> clear of the water, and possesses physiological adaptations that allow it to maintain an internal body temperature warmer {{than that of the}} surrounding sea water. The common thresher has an aplacental viviparous mode of reproduction, with oophagous embryos that feed on undeveloped eggs ovulated by their mother. Females typically give birth to four pups at a time, following a gestation period of nine months.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project developed from a realisation {{that there was}} a missing link between movement work for grounding and the next demand on the student to jump. Debbie Green and Ita O'Brien began their research, ‘From grounded foot <b>to</b> <b>leaping</b> foot’ in February 2009, proposing the statement ‘grounding is a pre-requisite’ as the premise from which to start the investigation into how the use of the feet can be developed to take the actor from this deeply grounded place <b>to</b> jump and <b>leap</b> safely. The work is explored within the context of fundamental movement for the acting student with the aim of maximising the actor's physical choices within her/his expressive work. From being grounded <b>to</b> <b>leaping</b> is quite literally a big ‘leap’ for acting students to make. Following nine months of research (March–December 2009), Green and O'Brien led a series of six practical sessions with nine volunteer actors between January and March 2010 to develop the progression from the ground, through the rigour and preparation required to take the body into a jump and <b>leap,</b> <b>to</b> the strength and articulation required to land safely. The work was then presented as a Practice and Pedagogy Forum, to an invited audience within the Research Events programme at Central School of Speech & Drama on 26 October 2010. The work has subsequently been taken back into the classroom. This article is the culmination of the research into the progression of work, ‘From grounded foot <b>to</b> <b>leaping</b> foot’...|$|R

5|$|This species forages in {{the early}} morning or late {{afternoon}} either alone or in small groups in leaf litter and on dead tree trunks. It is also known <b>to</b> <b>leap</b> upwards to grab prey on overhanging foliage. It looks for its prey either by standing still and scanning the surrounding area or by tossing the leaf litter away with its beak. It also frequently follows columns of Dorylus ants, feeding on the insects flushed by the ants. It also is known to hunt in streams for crabs and fish. It crushes snails with its beak and, if its prey struggles, smashes it against the ground. While an uncommon occurrence, male rockfowl have been observed giving food to a female.|$|E
5|$|In {{a three-part}} series {{published}} between February and May 1994, Brock attempts to save San Francisco {{as it is}} besieged by an army of goblins. Morbius the Living Vampire and the Demogoblin are magically transported from New York; Morbius joins Brock to defeat the goblins, led by criminal-turned-politician Charles Palentine (who wears a magic necklace which controls the goblins). Palentine uses fear of the goblin attacks to seize control {{of the city and}} convince its citizens to burn it down. Demogoblin takes the necklace, and the liberated goblins attack Palentine. Demogoblin then leads the goblins across the Golden Gate Bridge, ordering them <b>to</b> <b>leap</b> to their deaths. Demogoblin and Morbius then leave for New York. Of DCD's 300 bestselling issues of 1994, Venom: Enemy Within #2 was number 286; the remaining issues did not chart.|$|E
5|$|Using {{an anchor}} to steady his ship, Campbell placed Dart {{alongside}} the French frigate, with his bows between the French ship's masts. This allowed a boarding party led by Lieutenant James M'Dermeit <b>to</b> <b>leap</b> aboard Désirée {{and drive the}} French off the frigate's deck in hand-to-hand combat. M'Dermeit {{was wounded in the}} fighting, and called across for reinforcements as the French regrouped in the stern of the ship. Campbell used his anchors to swing Dart alongside the French frigate and a second boarding party under Lieutenant William Isaac Pearce charged aboard, routing the French reinforcements that were emerging from below decks. With the upper deck secure, Pearce severed the anchor cables, steered Désirée out of the harbour and over the sandbars that were rapidly being exposed by the receding tide. With his target captured, Campbell turned Dart towards the second British attack, against the head of the French line.|$|E

5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} crossings, steamers took the crowds from Circular Quay, although this time only four were needed, while another 600–700 people {{made their own}} way to the site. The ride was scheduled for 3 pm on 23 December, but delays meant L'Estrange did not appear until 6 pm. Although the length of rope was over 182 metres, it was only just over nine metres above the water. The stay wires were held in boats on either side, with the crews rowing against each other to keep it steady. L'Estrange rode his bicycle towards the centre, where, with the rope swinging to and fro, he stopped briefly to steady himself but instead, realising he was losing his balance, he was forced <b>to</b> <b>leap</b> from the rope and fell into the water below. Although he was unhurt, it was another knock to his reputation. A repeat attempt was announced for the following weekend. Again steamers took a dwindling crowd to Banbury Bay where they found L'Estrange's rope had been mysteriously cut, and he cancelled the performance. The Daily Telegraph reported that many in the crowd, who had paid for tickets on the steamers, felt they had been scammed.|$|E
5|$|French {{fire was}} {{taking its toll}} on the British ship, and at 22:20, Amethysts {{mizzenmast}} was shot through and collapsed on the quarterdeck, smashing the wheel and impeding Seymour's command of his ship. Thétis began to pull ahead and Pinsum attempted to rake Amethyst in her disorganised state, turning sharply to starboard but coming to a sudden halt as her own mizzenmast collapsed. With their ability to manoeuvre severely hindered, Amethyst and Thétis gradually closed on one another, Pinsum ordering the soldiers on his frigate to board the British vessel and capture her, while Seymour prepared for the eventuality by loading his cannon with two roundshot and his carronades with double loads of grapeshot. At 23:00, Pinsum suddenly swung his frigate towards Amethyst, the bows colliding and rebounding and the French stern swinging towards the British. At his signal, the soldiers and sailors crowded onto the deck and railings, ready <b>to</b> <b>leap</b> onto the British ship and engage her crew in hand-to-hand combat. With seconds remaining, Seymour ordered his gunners to fire. The double-shotted broadside, fired at point-blank range, killed or wounded over 100 men, including most of the officers. Only four guns were still serviceable on Thétis, which was set alight in three places due to {{the proximity of the}} British muzzle flashes.|$|E
