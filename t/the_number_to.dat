5|$|The Red Wings {{have also}} made the number 6 of Larry Aurie and the number 16 of Vladimir Konstantinov no longer {{available}} for issue.

Konstantinov's number has not been issued to any player since he was permanently disabled in a vehicle accident after the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals. Number 99 is also unavailable due to having been retired by the league in honor of Wayne Gretzky.|$|E
5|$|The Treblinka {{trials of}} the 1960s took place in Düsseldorf and {{produced}} the two official West German estimates. During the 1965 trial of Kurt Franz, the Court of Assize in Düsseldorf concluded that at least 700,000 people were killed at Treblinka, following a report by Dr. Helmut Krausnick, director of the Institute for Contemporary History in Munich. During Franz Stangl's trial in 1969 the same court reassessed <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>to</b> be at least 900,000 after new evidence from Dr. Wolfgang Scheffler.|$|E
5|$|On 13 November 1962, Tsarapkin {{indicated}} that the Soviet Union would accept a proposal drafted by US and Soviet experts involving automated test detection stations ("black boxes") and {{a limited number of}} on-site inspections. The two sides disagreed over the number of black boxes, however, as the US sought 12–20 such stations and the Soviet Union rejected any more than three. On 28 December 1962, Kennedy lowered the US demand to 8–10 stations. On 19 February 1963, the number was lowered further to seven, as Khrushchev continued to insist on no more than three. Kennedy was willing to reduce <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>to</b> six, though this was not clearly communicated to the Soviet Union. On 20 April 1963, Khrushchev withdrew support for three inspections entirely.|$|E

5|$|Uematsu had {{originally}} {{calculated that the}} game would require more than 100 pieces of music, but managed to reduce <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>to</b> 56. He has stated that he developed the ideas for the music by first reading through the script and creating the titles {{for all of the}} tracks, then composing melodies to match the themes of the story and titles. Uematsu felt that the sound quality of the soundtrack for Final Fantasy V was much better than that of Final Fantasy IV. He also claimed that this resulted in the soundtrack release requiring two CDs as opposed to the one CD required for the Final Fantasy IV soundtrack. Uematsu has stated that he would have preferred to keep the soundtrack to one CD, {{in order to keep the}} price of the album low.|$|E
