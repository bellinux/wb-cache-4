Does it work, and how good is it? A new Cochrane re-view [1] has pulled together the evidence. Searching Searching was exhaustive. Randomised trials were sought in which nicotine replacement was compared with placebo or no treatment, or studies with different doses of nicotine. Stud-ies had to report cessation rate. Outcomes The outcome was smoking cessation, with at least six months of follow-up. The estimate at 12 months was taken when avail-able, with six months being taken only when 12 -month data were unavailable. The strictest criterion available was used to define abstinence, preference being given to biochemical confirmation of abstinence. Patients lost to follow up were regarded as being continuing smokers.
