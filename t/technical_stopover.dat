50|$|Since July 2012, Air New Zealand {{has used}} Invercargill as a {{technical}} stop when conditions in Queenstown restrict aircraft from taking off with sufficient fuel to fly directly to Australia due to inclement weather or operational reasons (e.g. high payload). In the past such flights have been routed through Christchurch, adding two hours to the journey, but by comparison going via Invercargill saves one hour. As this is a <b>technical</b> <b>stopover</b> passengers {{are not able to}} leave the aircraft. During 2012 only two A320s were routed through Invercargill.|$|E
