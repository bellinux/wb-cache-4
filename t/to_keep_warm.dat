5|$|After a {{training}} camp near Nice in southern France Simpson rode in the one-day Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne in Belgium, finishing second to 's Arthur Decabooter. The conditions were so cold, he only completed the race <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm.</b> Albert Beurick started Simpson's supporters club at the Café Den Engel, raising £250 {{for him in}} the first nine months. In Paris–Nice, his tyre punctured during stage four, losing five minutes and used the rest of the race for training.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamsters {{may also}} live near areas of human civilization. In Mongolia, {{they may be}} found in yurts <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm</b> during the winter, as they do not have {{thermoregulation}} like the Djungarian hamster. They have five main predators: the Eurasian eagle owl, the steppe eagle, the corsac fox, the common kestrel, and the saker falcon. All distribution areas have more females than males, because males are at higher risk from predators, as they cannot move as quickly.|$|E

5|$|From {{the moment}} the egg is hatched, the male {{macaroni}} penguin cares for the newly hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since {{only a few of}} its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to the chick every one to two days. When they are not being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form crèches <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm</b> and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70days, they are ready to go out to sea on their own.|$|E
5|$|The delay {{caused the}} entire {{production}} schedule to be revised, and cinematographer Carlo Carlini, {{who had a}} prior commitment, had {{to be replaced by}} Otello Martelli, a long-time favorite of Fellini's. When filming resumed in February 1954, it was winter. The temperature had dropped to -5°C, often resulting in no heat or hot water, necessitating more delays and forcing the cast and crew to sleep fully dressed and wear hats <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{people of}} Chamba {{were known to}} have worn a fine woolen blanket or chadar around the waist, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm</b> in the cold climate. It was often tied or girdled with a band or patka, as {{evidenced}} by some archaeological discoveries in the area depicting this fashion. The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and loose-fitting white woolen garments known as a chola, tied around the waist with a black wool rope. A local custom in Chamba was to give the Jogi of the Natha sect a cotton maikhal sheet to wear over the head during the Nuwala ceremony to honour Lord Siva. Chamba and the surrounding district have been well documented as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} marine mammals, the sea otter has no blubber and relies on its {{exceptionally}} thick fur <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm.</b> With up to 150,000 {{strands of hair}} per square centimeter (nearly one million per sqin), its fur is the densest of any animal. The fur consists of long, waterproof guard hairs and short underfur; the guard hairs keep the dense underfur layer dry. Cold water is kept completely away from the skin and heat loss is limited. The fur is thick year-round, as it is shed and replaced gradually {{rather than in a}} distinct molting season. As the ability of the guard hairs to repel water depends on utmost cleanliness, the sea otter has the ability to reach and groom the fur on any part of its body, taking advantage of its loose skin and an unusually supple skeleton. The coloration of the pelage is usually deep brown with silver-gray speckles, but it can range from yellowish or grayish brown to almost black. In adults, the head, throat, and chest are lighter in color {{than the rest of the}} body.|$|E
25|$|The phrase three dog night, {{meaning it}} is so cold you would need three dogs in bed with you <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm,</b> {{originated}} with the Chukchi people of Siberia, who kept the Siberian husky landrace dog that became the modern purebred breed of Siberian Husky.|$|E
25|$|In the winter, horses grow a heavy {{hair coat}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm</b> and usually stay warm if well-fed and allowed access to shelter. But if kept artificially clipped for show, or if under stress from age, {{sickness}} or injury, a horse blanket {{may need to}} be added to protect the horse from cold weather. In the summer, access to shade is well-advised.|$|E

25|$|Lighting a {{fire and}} cooking food are among the {{activities}} prohibited on Shabbat by the written Torah. Therefore, cooked Shabbat food, such as cholent or hamin, must be prepared {{before the onset of}} the Jewish Shabbat – by some as early as Thursdays and certainly not later than Friday afternoon. The pre-cooked food may then be kept hot for the Shabbat meal by the provision in the Rabbinical oral law, which explains that one may use a fire that was lit before Shabbat <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm</b> food that was already cooked before Shabbat.|$|E
25|$|Most WDs {{lived in}} barracks, each wing of which {{typically}} accommodated approximately 68 women. WDs {{who worked at}} Air Force Headquarters in Ottawa lived in a barrack block that housed up to 800 airwomen. The barracks weren't well insulated. During winter some had to sleep with their uniforms <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm</b> while some found unusual ways to insulate their mattresses such as using newspapers. In locations such as cities where government housing was not available, personnel would live in private accommodations and receive an allowance to pay for room, board, and transportation.|$|E
25|$|From the {{beginning}} of the war, the German authorities found themselves confronted with an unexpected influx of prisoners. In September 1914, 125,050 French soldiers and 94,000 Russian ones were held captive. Before 1915, conditions of detention in Germany were very harsh and marked by temporary lodging and the absence of infrastructure. The prisoners slept in hangars or tents, where they dug holes <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm.</b> The humid forts requisitioned to serve as places of detention led to numerous cases of pulmonary illness. The German authorities also commandeered schools, barns and various other types of shelters. Camps were established in the countryside as well as near the towns, which had consequences when epidemics of cholera or typhus threatened to spread to the civilian population.|$|E

The others hardly listen to his tale as they set up the table to eat and drink. Schaunard interrupts, telling them that they must save the food for the days ahead: tonight they will all celebrate his good fortune by dining at Cafe Momus, and he will pay.|$|E
25|$|Meehan was {{questioned}} {{in relation to}} the 1971 Scottish soldiers' killings but never charged. In the six weeks following the beginning of Operation Demetrius in August 1971, six soldiers from the Green Howards regiment were killed by the IRA in north Belfast. Meehan {{became one of the most}} wanted IRA members in the area, and when arrested he was badly beaten by soldiers and needed 47 stitches to the back of his head. Meehan was imprisoned without charge under the Special Powers Act in Crumlin Road Jail. Meehan and two other IRA members including Joe B. O'Hagan escaped from prison on 2 December 1971. The men covered themselves in butter <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm,</b> then hid inside a manhole for six-and-a-half hours before scaling the prison walls using ropes made from knotted blankets and sheets.|$|E
25|$|Before {{and after}} the nesting season, groups of {{breeding}} birds will sometimes initiate gatherings; these seem to occur at the boundary of the group's combined range or in the unclaimed land separating it from neighbouring groups. The initiation signal is a conspicuous display flight given by a bird surveying its territory: it spirals tens of meters/yards high into the air, usually briefly does a fluttering hover {{at the top of}} the spiral, and then glides down. Group neighbours will respond by performing the same type of flight, and eventually about half the group's members will depart to the meeting location where they will spend several tens of minutes – sometimes more than an hour – chattering, calling, duetting, and excitedly moving about the meeting site (which typically is some small tree or shrubbery). In winter, birds will often assemble in small groups and roost together, particularly <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm</b> during the night; this is apparently not initiated with a specific assembly display however.|$|E

500|$|In {{the mornings}} the ring-tailed lemur sunbathes to warm itself. It faces the sun sitting {{in what is}} {{frequently}} described as a [...] "sun-worshipping" [...] posture or lotus position. However, it sits with its legs extended outward, not cross-legged, and will often support itself on nearby branches. Sunning is often a group activity, particularly during the cold mornings. At night, troops will split into sleeping parties huddling closely together <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is highly social, living {{in groups of}} up to 30 individuals. [...] It is also female dominant, a trait common among lemurs. <b>To</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm</b> and reaffirm social bonds, groups will huddle together. The ring-tailed lemur will also sunbathe, sitting upright facing its underside, with its thinner white fur towards the sun. Like other lemurs, this species relies {{strongly}} on its sense of smell and marks its territory with scent glands. [...] The males perform a unique scent marking behavior called spur marking and will participate in stink fights by impregnating their tail with their scent and wafting it at opponents.|$|E
