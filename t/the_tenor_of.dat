25|$|With his contemporaries, Willaert {{developed}} the canzone (a form of polyphonic secular song) and ricercare, which were forerunners of modern instrumental forms. Willaert also arranged 22 four-part madrigals for voice and lute written by Verdelot. In an early 4-part vocal work, Quid non ebrietas? (In some sources called the Chromatic Duo) Willaert uses musica ficta {{around the circle}} of 5ths {{in one of the}} voices resulting in an augmented 7th in unison with the ending octave, an outstanding experiment with chromatic enharmonicism. Willaert {{was among the first to}} extensively use chromaticism in the madrigal. Looking forward, we are given an image of early word painting in his madrigal Mentre che'l cor. Willaert, who was fond of the older compositional techniques such as the canon, often placed the melody in <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> his compositions, treating it as a cantus firmus. Willaert, with the help of De Rore, standardized a five-voice setting in madrigal composition. Willaert also pioneered a style that continued until the end of the madrigal period of reflecting the emotional qualities of the text and the meanings of important words as sharply and clearly as possible.|$|E

25|$|Later on, <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> town {{development}} shifted northward. Two fisherman harbours, Tsing Yi Tong and Mun Tsai Tong were reclaimed {{for residential}} use. Many fishermen were relocated from their boats {{parked in the}} typhoon shelter to the Ching Tao House, a new residential block on land, of Chueng Ching Estate. The land inhabitants were put together into several designated areas so as to re-build their villages. The primary sectors had all died out owing to the drastic town development. Tsing Yi Estate, Cheung On Estate, Cheung Fat Estate, Ching Tai Court and Tsing Yi Garden were built after all reclamations were accomplished. Ching Wah Court was built adjoining to Cheung Hong Estate. At the same time, Tsing Yi Bridge was seriously overburdened and its structure was unable to cope with increasing traffic. There was only a one-way road in each direction on the bridge. Traffic congestion became the burning problem in the community, and subsequently aroused protest. Finally, Tsing Yi North Bridge, a connection to Tsuen Wan Town was built to ease off the congestion, {{as well as to}} accommodate the local residential population boom.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> the bishop's {{complaints}} is surprising, as Chetwynd {{was often}} guilty of {{much worse than}} financial ineptitude. It seems that he maintained an armed retinue {{and he was not}} afraid to use it. In 1316 Vivian de Staundon robbed a royal official who was carrying a large sum of money to Ireland on behalf of Edward II Chetwynd, together with John Ipstones, a local baron, raised a large force of armed men to prevent Staundon's arrest and then sheltered him from justice, absorbing him into their own retinues. Warrants were issued for the arrest of both of them but, although Ipstones was apprehended, Chetwynd escaped and went to ground, evading several attempts to bring him to court, and the matter seems to have lapsed. In 1321 he again evaded justice by the simple expedient of not answering the summons, when the king prosecuted him for falsely claiming immunity from tolls and harbour dues in London. Despite his criminal history, when he retired in 1330, Chetwynd was allowed the revenues of two manors, Blackfordby and Freasley, and of two churches, as well as his food, fuel, candles, two horses, a capacious lodging at the abbey and hospitality for his guests. Even this was not enough for him: the disgruntled ex-abbot seized the abbey by force and pillaged it. The matter was only resolved when Edward III sent in keepers to restore order. This marked a low point in the reputation of the abbey.|$|E

Bell says of this work, [...] "in tone and temper, it is incontestably superior to the Short Story, and, while devoted especially to the vindication of its author's doctrinal views, agreeably to the school of polemics then in vogue, it contains some key retorts upon his detractors, and indicates a mind trained to logical acuteness, and imbued with the learning of the times".|$|E

Gould recalls that [...] "Eldredge's 1971 publication [...] had presented the only new and interesting ideas on the paleontological implications of the subject—so I asked Schopf if we could present the paper jointly." [...] According to Gould [...] "the ideas came mostly from Niles, with yours truly acting as a sounding board and eventual scribe. I coined the term punctuated equilibrium and wrote most of our 1972 paper, but Niles is the proper first author in our pairing of Eldredge and Gould." [...] In his book Time Frames Eldredge recalls that after much discussion the pair [...] "each wrote roughly half. Some of the parts that would seem obviously the work of one of us were actually first penned by the other—I remember for example, writing the section on Gould's snails. Other parts are harder to reconstruct. Gould edited the entire manuscript for better consistency.

500|$|Sean Connery was {{the first}} actor to portray Bond on film in Dr. No (1962). An amateur bodybuilder, {{he had come to}} the {{attention}} of the Bond film producers after several appearances in British films from the late 1950s. At a muscular 6'2", Fleming originally disapproved of his casting as James Bond, believing him to be an overgrown stuntman who lacked the finesse and elegance to play James Bond; he envisaged a suave actor, such as David Niven playing the role. Producer Albert R. Broccoli—known to all as Cubby—disagreed with Fleming's view, later commenting that [...] "I wanted a ballsy guy... put a bit of veneer over that tough Scottish hide and you've got Fleming's Bond instead of all the mincing poofs we had applying for the job". Eon's choice of Connery was also based on his looks and sex appeal, an appeal that would later be echoed by Honor Blackman who said, after appearing with Connery in Goldfinger, [...] "He was exceedingly handsome, virile and sexy and that really was <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> what the script was always trying to display". After Connery was chosen, director Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser, and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London.
