5|$|As {{time went}} on, Louis XVIII {{realised}} that France would never accept {{an attempt to}} return to the Ancien Régime. Accordingly, he created another policy in 1805 with a view toward reclaiming his throne: a declaration that was far more liberal than his former ones. It repudiated his Declaration of Verona, promised to abolish conscription, retain Napoleon I's administrative and judicial system, reduce taxes, eliminate political prisons, and guarantee amnesty <b>to</b> <b>everyone</b> who did not oppose a Bourbon Restoration. The opinions expressed in the declaration were largely those of the Count of Avaray, Louis's closest associate in exile.|$|E

5|$|English astrology {{had reached}} its zenith by the 17th century. Astrologers were theorists, researchers, and social engineers, {{as well as}} {{providing}} individual advice <b>to</b> <b>everyone</b> from monarchs downwards. Among other things, astrologers could advise on the best time to take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for physical or mental illnesses, and predict natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything—people, the world, the universe—was understood to be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with religion, magic and science.|$|E
