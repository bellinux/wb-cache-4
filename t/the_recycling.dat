The attention is paid mainly {{to the process of}} <b>the</b> physical <b>recycling.</b> <b>The</b> dry <b>recycling</b> process is compared with <b>the</b> wet <b>recycling</b> process from <b>the</b> point of view of applied technology and quality with focus on the final product (PET flakes) from <b>the</b> wet <b>recycling</b> process. As <b>the</b> quality is concerned, presence of blockers and polyvinyl chloride, which causes the most serious problems during recycling, is discussed.

40|$|Sorting endosomes and <b>the</b> endocytic <b>recycling</b> {{compartment}} {{are critical}} intracellular stores for <b>the</b> rapid <b>recycling</b> of internalized membrane receptors {{to the cell}} surface in multiple cell types. However, the molecular mechanisms distinguishing fast receptor recycling from sorting endosomes and slow receptor <b>recycling</b> from <b>the</b> endocytic <b>recycling</b> compartment remain poorly understood. We previously reported that Rab 15 differentially regulates transferrin receptor trafficking through sorting endosomes and <b>the</b> endocytic <b>recycling</b> compartment, suggesting a role for distinct Rab 15 -effector interactions at these endocytic compartments. In this study, we identified the novel protein Rab 15 effector protein (REP 15) as a binding partner for Rab 15 -GTP. REP 15 is compartment specific, colocalizing with Rab 15 and Rab 11 on <b>the</b> endocytic <b>recycling</b> compartment but not with Rab 15, Rab 4, or early endosome antigen 1 on sorting endosomes. REP 15 interacts directly with Rab 15 -GTP but not with Rab 5 or Rab 11. Consistent with its localization, REP 15 overexpression and small interfering RNA-mediated depletion inhibited transferrin receptor <b>recycling</b> from <b>the</b> endocytic <b>recycling</b> compartment, without affecting receptor entry into or recycling from sorting endosomes. Our data identify REP 15 as a compartment-specific protein for receptor <b>recycling</b> from <b>the</b> endocytic <b>recycling</b> compartment, highlighting that the rapid and slow modes of transferrin receptor recycling are mechanistically distinct pathways...|$|R

5|$|The {{lack of a}} {{magnetosphere}} and {{the extremely}} thin atmosphere of Mars are a challenge: the planet has little heat transfer across its surface, poor insulation against bombardment of the solar wind and insufficient atmospheric pressure to retain water in a liquid form (water instead sublimes to a gaseous state).

Burns really was trying to change and this was reflected in the end when he tried to give Lisa her share of the profits, with Lisa refusing. Burns was drawn without his trademark scowl for this episode. The staff joked about this being a suitable series finale, due to the episode ending with Homer suffering from another heart attack after Lisa tells Homer what 10% of Burns' $120,000,000 check really is.|$|E
5|$|Establishing a {{partnership}} with Robert Stirling Newall in 1850, Bell set up the first factory {{in the world with}} machines able to manufacture steel rope and submarine cable. Two years later his brothers Thomas Bell and John Bell joined him to build a major iron works at Port Clarence, Middlesbrough on the north bank of the River Tees. By 1853 there were three blast furnaces, each with a capacity of just over 6000 cubic feet, making them the largest in Britain at the time. The works produced iron for bridges and steel rails for railways across the British Empire including the North Eastern Railway company, of which Bell was a director from 1864 onwards, and deputy chairman from 1895 until his death. The Bell brothers' company operated its own ironstone mines at Normanby and Cleveland, and its own limestone quarries in Weardale, employing about 6000 men in mining and manufacturing. By 1878 the firm was producing 200,000 tons of iron per annum. Bell was a professional metallurgist and industrial chemist, constantly pioneering processes such as <b>the</b> <b>recycling</b> of heat from escaping flue gases, and trialling many process improvements.|$|E

5|$|The Garbage Museum was a waste-management themed museum {{located in}} Stratford, Connecticut, United States. Constructed and opened in 1994, <b>the</b> <b>recycling</b> {{facility}} and museum was constructed for {{a cost of}} $5 million and funded through a group of 19 local municipalities, collectively known as the Southwest Connecticut Recycling Committee. The museum was operated by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority which focused on empowering visitors with knowledge about waste management and allowed visitors to watch the sorting process of recyclables. The most iconic exhibit was Trash-o-saurus, a dinosaur sculpture made of garbage. Funding for the museum dropped in 2009 due to expiring contracts, but remained open until 2011. The closure of the museum followed a failed fundraising campaign. In 2014, the Connecticut General Assembly approved a measure to fund the museum by allowing the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to award a grant of up to $100,000 to the Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority.|$|E
