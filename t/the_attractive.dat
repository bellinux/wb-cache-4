5|$|Although still young, Henry was {{increasingly}} gaining {{a reputation as}} an energetic and capable leader. His prestige and power increased further when he unexpectedly married Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152; Eleanor was <b>the</b> <b>attractive</b> Duchess of Aquitaine and the recently divorced wife of Louis VII of France, and the marriage made Henry the future ruler of a huge swathe of territory across France.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>the</b> {{globally}} <b>attractive</b> sets of a hyperchaotic {{system have}} important {{applications in the}} fields of engineering, science, and technology, it is often a difficult task for the researchers to obtain <b>the</b> globally <b>attractive</b> set of <b>the</b> hyperchaotic systems due to the complexity of the hyperchaotic systems. Therefore, we will study <b>the</b> globally <b>attractive</b> set of a generalized hyperchaotic Lorenz–Stenflo system describing the evolution of finite amplitude acoustic gravity waves in a rotating atmosphere in this paper.

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1907, Baden-Powell went on an {{extensive}} speaking tour arranged by his publisher, Arthur Pearson, to promote his forthcoming book, Scouting for Boys. He had not simply rewritten his Aids to Scouting; he omitted the military aspects and transferred the techniques (mainly survival) to non-military heroes: backwoodsmen, explorers (and later on, sailors and airmen). He also added innovative educational principles (the Scout method) by which he extended <b>the</b> <b>attractive</b> game to a personal mental education.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrons}} in an atom {{are attracted to}} the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. This force binds the {{electrons in}}side an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater <b>the</b> <b>attractive</b> force. Hence electrons bound {{near the center of}} the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.|$|E

5|$|The {{stability}} of the 6s shell {{is due to the}} presence of a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the nuclear charge that increases <b>the</b> <b>attractive</b> Coulomb interaction of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see lanthanide contraction). The absence of a filled inner f shell is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc, although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points.|$|E
5|$|An {{electron}} can {{be bound}} to the nucleus of an atom by <b>the</b> <b>attractive</b> Coulomb force. A system {{of one or more}} electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom. If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an atomic orbital. Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their spin quantum number.|$|E
5|$|Joe Mallett {{presided over}} relegation before acting as {{assistant}} to Stan Cullis, who laid {{the foundations for}} the team's future success before retiring from football in 1970. Chosen only after abortive approaches were made to Don Revie, Brian Clough and Ronnie Allen, Freddie Goodwin converted <b>the</b> <b>attractive</b> but inconsistent football of Cullis's teams to a skilful, aggressive game capable of winning promotion and maintaining top-flight status. The side struggled after Goodwin sold Bob Latchford, so first-team coach Willie Bell was promoted to manager, initially in a caretaker capacity. After achieving little in two years, Bell was replaced by club director Sir Alf Ramsey, whose brief managerial tenure ended with him leaving the club entirely. Jim Smith brought experienced players to the club but was sacked {{to make way for}} Ron Saunders, who had just walked out on league champions and local rivals Aston Villa.|$|E

5|$|Many {{paintings}} can {{be found}} in the museums of Europe depicting tulips with attractive coloured stripes. Most, such as the still life studies of Johannes Bosschaert, were painted during the 17th century. These flowers were particularly popular and became sought after by those who could afford them. At the peak of this tulip mania in the 1630s, one bulb could cost as much as a house. It was not known at the time that the stripes were caused by a virus accidentally transferred by humans to tulips from jasmine. Weakened by the virus, the plants turned out to be a poor investment. Only a few bulbs produced flowers with <b>the</b> <b>attractive</b> characteristics of their parent plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{physical properties}} of the noble gases are dominated by the weak van der Waals forces between the atoms. <b>The</b> <b>attractive</b> force increases {{with the size of}} the atom {{as a result of the}} increase in polarizability and the decrease in ionization potential. This results in systematic group trends: as one goes down group18, the atomic radius, and with it the interatomic forces, increases, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporization, and solubility. The increase in density is due to the increase in atomic mass.|$|E
5|$|The name of Calafia {{was likely}} formed from the Arabic word khalifa (religious state leader) {{which is known}} as caliph in English and califa in Spanish. Similarly, the name of Calafia's monarchy, California, likely {{originated}} from the same root, fabricated by the author to remind the 16th-century Spanish reader of the reconquista, a centuries-long fight between Christians and Muslims which had recently concluded in Spain. The character of Calafia is used by Rodríguez de Montalvo to portray the superiority of chivalry in which <b>the</b> <b>attractive</b> virgin queen is conquered, converted to Christian beliefs and married off. The book was very popular for many decades—Hernán Cortés read it—and it was selected by author Miguel de Cervantes as {{the first of many}} popular and assumed harmful books to be burnt by characters in his famous novel Don Quixote.|$|E

5|$|The phase {{behavior}} of lipid bilayers is determined {{largely by the}} strength of <b>the</b> <b>attractive</b> Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing {{the strength of this}} interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails. An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.|$|E

The Malkavians have separate dialog options, reflecting their inherent insanity. Upgrading some skills provides additional dialog options; attractive and charismatic characters seduce to get their way, aggressive characters threaten, and others persuade their targets to cooperate.|$|E

His plan is to use his friendship with Dr. Ian Duncan to obtain test answers. In the cafeteria Jeff meets <b>the</b> <b>attractive</b> Britta, and (in an attempt to get closer to her) convinces her to join his non-existent Spanish study group. As the study group convenes, Jeff pretends the other members simply did not show up. Britta, however, has invited Abed to join them. Jeff unsuccessfully tries to make him leave, and then gets called to the football field by Dr. Duncan. The professor makes a futile attempt to appeal to Jeff's conscience, and eventually agrees to provide the answers. Jeff returns to the study group, discovering that Abed has also invited Troy, Shirley, Pierce and Annie. Finding Britta smoking outside, he suggests the two study alone, but she persuades him to return.|$|E
