She explained to the President that craters on the moon were caused by impacts from space materials. The Russellville, Alabama-based group Russellville City Schools Engineering Rocket Team attended the event and were personally recognized by President Obama.

5|$|Mobilisation {{began at}} the onset of the war, in August 1914, at which time the 1st King's was based at Aldershot. Under command of Lieutenant-Colonel W.S. Bannatyne, the 1st King's boarded the SS Irrawaddy at Southampton. The {{battalion}} landed at Le Havre on 13 August with the 6th Brigade, 2nd Division, one of the original components of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The BEF first engaged the German Army at Mons, Belgium, after which it went into a retreat that was sustained until 5 September, when the Allies resolved <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Marne, a river east of Paris. Having acted as a rearguard to the 2nd Division, the 1st King's and its brigade prevented a German force cutting off the 4th (Guards) Brigade, forming the rearguard at Villers-Cotteréts, and 70th Battery, Royal Field Artillery. The brigade extricated the guns, earning it praise from the 2nd Division's commanding officer, Major-General Monro.|$|E

The cemetery was totally enclosed by very high walls that still remain. Most mausoleums and crypts were constructed following the neo-classical style trend that prevailed at the time. Thick walls and piers were used as the main structural system. These were constructed using brick/"argarnasa", stone and mortar.|$|E

A member of the Liberal Party, Aquino's husband Ninoy rose to become the youngest governor {{in the country and}} eventually became the youngest senator ever elected to the Senate of the Philippines in 1967. During her husband's political career, Aquino remained a housewife who helped raise their children and played hostess to her spouse's political allies who would frequent their Quezon City home.

500|$|After all the {{cardinals}} present {{have taken the}} oath, the Master of the Papal Liturgical Celebrations orders all individuals other than the cardinal electors and conclave participants to leave the Chapel.

[...] In modern practice, the Master of the Papal Liturgical Celebrations does not have <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door of the Sistine Chapel—during the 2013 conclave, the Master Guido Marini stood in front of the altar and gave the command through a microphone and only went to the chapel doors to close them after the outsiders had left.|$|E
500|$|The Elliot Lake Standard {{reported}} in 2008 on [...] "greater than normal" [...] leaks causing damages to multiple units. Starlight Cafe closed permanently, despite being profitable soon after opening, as customers would occasionally need umbrellas <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> take-out counter. Drip-tarps installed by {{the mall in}} the kitchen of the restaurant were ineffective. The cafe owner was not made aware of the leaks before starting her lease in 2007, and was successful in a lawsuit against the owner. Scotiabank had closed for a few weeks in 2008 as a precaution. (Scotiabank began construction on a new location in July 2011, to replace their mall location.) Some businesses suggested that additional leaks started after the new owner started repairs to the roof. Tenants noticed a reduced amount of traffic after leaks started, and buckets were scattered throughout the mall.|$|E
500|$|St. Gatien {{retired to}} the Heath Stud at Newmarket {{where he stood}} at an initial fee of 50 guineas. He {{remained}} in England until the summer of 1890 when he was sold to the German government for £14,000 and exported to stand at Graditz. He returned to England <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cobham stud until 1898 when he was exported to the United States and sold privately to James Ben Ali Haggin. He stood at Rancho del Paso, California until its closure in 1905. St. Gatien was repurchased by Haggin for $500 at the Rancho del Paso dispersal sale in December 1905, and he was relocated to Haggin's Elmendorf Farm. He was sold to George J. Long in January 1906 and was moved to Louisville, Kentucky. [...] The best of St. Gatien's progeny was probably Meddler (out of Busybody), who was a leading two-year-old in Britain where his wins included the Dewhurst Stakes. He was exported to the United States where he was twice Leading sire in North America.|$|E

500|$|Przemysł II, {{faithful}} to his previous agreements with Henry IV Probus, decided <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{head of the}} knights of Poznań, Wrocław (which generally are loyal to his ruler) and Głogów (commanded by their Duke Henry III) and marched to Legnica {{in order to obtain}} the freedom of Henry IV. The Legnica army was commanded by Bolesław II and his eldest son Henry V the Fat. The battle took place on 24 April 1277 in the village of Stolec near Ząbkowice Śląskie, and, according to modern historiography, was extremely bloody and lasted almost the entire day. Initially it seemed that the coalition Poznań-Głogów-Wrocław would have a complete victory. The situation became even more favorable to them when Bolesław II escape from the battlefield. However, his son Henry V decided to stay until the end, and in this desperate situation encouraged his knights to fight, and finally obtain the victory; to complete the success, even Przemysł II and Henry III were taken prisoners. However, according to Jan Długosz in his chronicle, for the Dukes of Legnica this was a Pyrrhic victory, since [...] "died in this battle so countless number of people that the knights of Legnica, although the winner, they could mock the vanquished, because the bloody paid for victory". The imprisonment of the Duke of Poznań, if it occurred, was brief. The argument against this was noted in {{the fact that there is}} no record of Przemysł II having to pay for his release.|$|E
500|$|After his wife's {{death in}} 1766, Fownes Luttrell decided <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> general {{election}} in 1768. Despite {{his efforts to}} build up support, there were still factions and opposition to him. To gain some form of patronage in Minehead, he travelled to London and obtained from the Government control over the offices in Minehead, which prevented his opponents from doing the same. Fownes Luttrell won that election, accumulating more than £1,800 worth of expenses in the process. While a member of parliament, he is not recorded as speaking and {{does not appear in}} the small number of division lists still surviving. According to Maxwell Lyte, [...] "it does not appear that [...] had any real zest for Parliamentary life [...] probably far happier with his hounds and his fighting cocks in Devon or Somerset." [...] However, it appears that the Prime Minister, Lord North, believed that in return for the Government's support in 1768, Fownes Luttrell had promised to return the Government's candidate, Thomas Pownall, at the next election; when that time came, in 1774, North supported Fownes Luttrell and [...] "warned off" [...] his rival, Charles Whitworth. However, Fownes Luttrell was elected alongside his eldest son, John, which caused a dispute between the former and North. The dispute was resolved when the elder Fownes Luttrell offered to resign that December, in favour of Pownall, on the condition that Pownall seek his approval before nominating any of his friends or himself in future; a draft document outlining his other conditions included a payment of £3,000 in return for his resignation.|$|E
