5|$|In 1992, Allen {{began the}} {{season on the}} {{practice}} squad while he recovered from a knee injury, but he replaced Doug Hocking as a starter in Week 3. By late August, <b>the</b> <b>Lions</b> were facing the return of several key import players, including Stewart Hill and Lee Johnson. To meet CFL import ratio requirements, which require each team to field {{a certain number of}} Canadian players, <b>the</b> <b>Lions</b> replaced Allen again with Hocking. Allen's season was hampered both by his early injury and import ratio troubles, limiting him to three games in which he recorded 13 tackles.

5|$|Lions are chiefly {{associated}} with Ishtar {{or with the}} male gods Shamash or Ningirsu. In Mesopotamian art, lions are nearly always depicted with open jaws.

5|$|Lions {{head coach}} Buddy Parker saw Johnson's {{value as a}} blocker and moved him to fullback. In his first season with Detroit in 1957, he led the team in rushing, {{carrying}} for 621 yards and five touchdowns. In the 1957 NFL Championship Game, which was won by <b>the</b> <b>Lions</b> 59–14 over the Cleveland Browns, Johnson carried seven times for 34 yards, caught a sixteen-yard pass, and recovered a fumble on defense. Going into the 1958 season, <b>the</b> <b>Lions</b> looked to continue their success, and Johnson {{was expected to be}} the team's primary ball carrier. However, Johnson missed several games due to injuries, and <b>the</b> <b>Lions</b> finished with a 4–7–1 record and one of the league's worst rushing offenses.|$|E
5|$|The Bears won the toss {{and elected}} to defer. On the first drive of the game, <b>the</b> <b>Lions</b> scored first when Harold Jones-Quartey slipped while {{covering}} and Stafford threw a nine-yard {{touchdown pass to}} Tim Wright. The Bears offense reached the Lions' five-yard line on their first possession, but Jay Cutler's pass to Cameron Meredith deflected off Nevin Lawson's helmet and was intercepted by James Ihedigbo. However, two consecutive sacks forced <b>the</b> <b>Lions</b> to punt. In the second quarter, after the Bears punted, Matt Prater attempted a 54-yard field goal, but missed wide right. The Bears eventually punted again, and <b>the</b> <b>Lions</b> reached the Bears' 35-yard line, but on 4th and 3, Stafford's pass for Calvin Johnson fell incomplete. Three plays later, <b>the</b> <b>Lions</b> regained possession of the ball when Ansah hit Cutler's arm as he threw to Marc Mariani, the pass being intercepted by Tahir Whitehead. Detroit converted the turnover into Prater's 59-yard field goal to end the first half. The Bears scored on their first drive {{of the second half}} with Robbie Gould's 49-yard field goal, and after Detroit punted, tied the score with Cutler's 34-yard touchdown pass to Josh Bellamy. Although <b>the</b> <b>Lions</b> scored with Stafford's 36-yard touchdown pass to Johnson, the Bears retaliated with Cutler's 23-yard score to Matt Forte; Detroit eventually responded with a one-yard touchdown by Eric Ebron. The Bears narrowed the score to 24–20 when Gould kicked a 34-yard field goal. <b>The</b> <b>Lions</b> punted again, and the Bears took over with 3:35 left in the game. Despite reaching the Lions' 37-yard line, Cutler was hit by Ansah while throwing to Deonte Thompson and was intercepted by Glover Quin. With less than two minutes left in the game, the Bears held <b>the</b> <b>Lions</b> to 3rd and 5, but Stafford's six-yard pass to Johnson gave <b>the</b> <b>Lions</b> a first down, where Stafford kneeled thrice to end the game.|$|E

After coaching the first three games of the 1958 season, Crowe was replaced by a group of seven people who coached <b>the</b> <b>Lions</b> for the next two games.
