500|$|Meeting with Deep Throat again, Deep Throat {{explains}} that Wilczek is being detained {{by the government}} at an undisclosed location. When Mulder asks if the COS survived, Deep Throat assures him the virus left no trace of it, and that scientists from the Defense Department have unsuccessfully examined the machine for any remaining signs of the program. At the Eurisko Building, Peterson directs a team attempting to recover the COS, but is told by his superiors to destroy the machine in six hours. Unbeknownst to Peterson, the COS comes back to life and watches as he says to himself, [...] "I'm going to figure <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> if it kills me".|$|E
60|$|RIDGEON [callously] Let us get <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> of the {{way before}} she comes.|$|E
60|$|HILLMAN (with {{an attempt}} at conciliation). I know if we could {{sit down and talk}} <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> with you, Mr. Pindar, you'd see it reasonable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Cheyne, {{and what}} d'you {{think of our}} city?--Yes, madam, you can sit {{anywhere}} you please.--You have <b>this</b> kind of <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> West, I presume?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Ozymandias - Attorney Barry quotes Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem in court: [...] "Would {{you want}} <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> {{crawling}} around <b>out</b> there? Would you want <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> marry your families? Look on my work, you mighty, and despair!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{grasp the}} point. The jolly old point! You fail to grasp it. If <b>this</b> bally <b>thing</b> comes <b>out,</b> my wife {{will be most}} frightfully sick!" ...|$|R
60|$|I said I had. What I needed {{then was}} air, not dinner. I felt that I {{wanted to get}} into the open and think <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Most people, Ozma, wouldn't {{have figured}} <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> {{the way you}} did," [...] remarked Dorothy. [...] "If I'd been alone the {{invisible}} wall surely would have stumped me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It all depends," [...] Weiss said, [...] "into whose {{hands that}} paper has gone. A week's grace is all I want, {{time enough to}} fight <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> with Duge." ...|$|E
60|$|The sea-booted youth {{began to}} bustle about at <b>this</b> summons, bearing <b>things</b> <b>out</b> into the {{darkness}} and running back for more with an alacrity which one would hardly have suspected from his uncouth appearance.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is often}} dubbed the [...] "Carl Pickens Clause," [...] {{stemming}} from the 2000 offseason. Brown renewed Bruce Coslet's contract despite his 21-36 Bengals record. Pickens responded, [...] "I don't understand it. We're trying to win; we're trying to turn <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> around <b>out</b> there. And they bring (Coslet) back." [...] Pickens finished {{his career with the}} Tennessee Titans.|$|R
6000|$|... 'In {{another moment}} we were {{standing}} face to face, I and <b>this</b> fragile <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> of futurity. He came straight {{up to me and}} laughed into my eyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at once. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said, [...] "we'll try to {{straighten}} <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out,</b> but I've {{no intention of}} being victimized. It's quite clear that the boys don't seem in a humor to permit that either." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Could {{you take}} <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> of my eye? It hurts dreadfully, and I shall be a {{spectacle}} {{by the time}} I get to Aunt Maria's," [...] answered Dolly, with a little moan that rent the hearer's susceptible heart.|$|E
60|$|HECTOR. [inexorably] No, Violet: I mean to have <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out,</b> right away. [He {{puts her}} aside; passes her by; and faces his father, whose cheeks darken as his Irish blood begins to simmer]. Dad: you've not played this hand straight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, ruin," [...] St. John repeated. [...] "Before <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> came <b>out</b> I refused twenty-five {{thousand}} for the place, because I knew I could get twenty-eight thousand. Now I couldn't get twenty-eight hundred. Couldn't {{you understand that}} {{the reputation of being}} haunted simply plays the devil with a piece of property?" [...] "Yes; yes, I did understand that, and for that very reason I was always careful--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a merciful {{release for}} Mr. Bastow {{that he should}} have died before <b>this</b> terrible <b>thing</b> came <b>out!</b> For after what you have told us I can hardly doubt that you are right, and that it is this wicked man who is guilty." ...|$|R
6000|$|BUILDER. You know I didn't mean that. I {{might just}} as well have said I'd done with you! Apply your wits, Julia! At any moment <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> may come <b>out.</b> In a little town like this you can keep nothing dark. How can I take this {{nomination}} for Mayor? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's just it--just {{what he has}} done!" [...] cried Phil. [...] "I've got---- But wait," [...] {{cried the}} shipowner's son, {{interrupting}} himself. [...] "I'll plan <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out.</b> You shall all be my guests later on," [...] he added, mysteriously.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{feel that}} you must fight <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> with such weapons as you have?" [...] she asked. [...] "I suppose you wouldn't allow your friends {{to provide you with}} more {{efficient}} ones? I know I have suggested as much already, and you would not listen, but it would make success so much easier." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Look at her, my boy. That's {{just the}} start--the foundation. You develop from that. But you keep away. That's the point. I've thought <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out.</b> Mind you, I don't claim {{absolutely}} {{all the credit}} for the idea myself. It's by way of being based on Christian Science. Absent treatment, and all that. But most of it's mine. All the fine work.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One must do something. I'm bandaged up and can't walk. It hurt my leg {{more than}} I knew--your doctor says. Solomonson won't talk of {{anything}} but how he feels, and I don't care a rap how he feels. So I got <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> and came <b>out</b> with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{has been}} known, during some years, {{that it was}} Lewis's purpose to buy a thirty dollar silver watch some day, if he ever got where he could afford it. Today Ida has given him a new, sumptuous gold Swiss stem-winding stop-watch; and if any scoffer shall say, [...] "Behold <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> is <b>out</b> of character," [...] there is an {{inscription}} within, which will silence him; for it will teach him that this wearer aggrandizes the watch, not the watch the wearer.|$|R
5000|$|Jenner also {{immediately}} {{followed up}} her [...] "what women wear" [...] dilemma with: It's more than that. I'm kind of {{at this point}} in my life where I'm trying to figure <b>this</b> womanhood <b>thing</b> <b>out.</b> It is more than hair, makeup, clothes, all that kind of stuff. There's an element here that I'm still kind of searching for. And I think that'll take a while. Because I think as far as gender, we're all on a journey. We're all learning and growing about ourselves. And I feel the same way.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must take}} my chance on that," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Spugg, firmly. [...] "I've thought <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> {{and made up}} my mind: If my chauffeur is killed, I mean to pay for him,--full and adequate compensation. The loss must fall on me, not on him. Or, say Henry comes back mutilated,--say he loses a leg,--say he loses two legs,--" ...|$|E
60|$|HIGGINS. You let her alone, mother. Let her {{speak for}} herself. You will jolly soon see whether {{she has an}} idea that I haven't put into her head or a word that I haven't put into her mouth. I tell you I have created <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> of the {{squashed}} cabbage leaves of Covent Garden; and now she pretends to play the fine lady with me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Annabel," [...] {{she said}} slowly, [...] "if I fight <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> myself, can I trust {{you that it}} will not be a vain sacrifice? After what you have said it is useless for us to play with words. You do not love your husband, you have married him for a position--to escape from--things which you feared. Will you be a {{faithful}} and honest wife? Will you do your duty by him, and forget all your past follies? Unless, Annabel, you can----" ...|$|E
500|$|I {{like being}} home, having my routines, looking after my garden {{and playing with}} my dog, but I also love playing. I love {{being able to do}} both ... I don't know what will happen after this. I've got no plans at the moment. I'm going to see how <b>this</b> {{motherhood}} <b>thing</b> turns <b>out.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{think the}} media have built <b>this</b> disco <b>thing</b> up <b>out</b> of all {{proportions}} in my case and so while people may {{come to see me}} on the pretence of seeing a disco show, they soon realise that there is so much more to me." [...] — Sylvester on his move away from disco ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{never make}} a pile, you won't, dad," [...] he exclaimed. [...] "You're so plaguedly narrow minded. Listen here," [...] he added, drawing {{a little closer}} to him, and looking round over his {{shoulder}} to be sure that no one was listening to him. [...] "When I come back, I'll make you open your eyes. You think <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> played <b>out,</b> do you? Bah! The letters aren't worth twopence to us. When I come back from abroad, I'm going to commence to play this game in a manner that'll rather astonish you, and a certain other person. Ta-ta, guv'nor." ...|$|R
60|$|Biggs’s boy, as I have said, came {{round the}} corner. He was evidently {{in a great}} hurry when he first dawned upon the vision, but, on {{catching}} sight of Harris and me, and Montmorency, and the things, he eased up and stared. Harris and I frowned at him. This might have wounded a more sensitive nature, but Biggs’s boys are not, as a rule, touchy. He came to a dead stop, a yard from our step, and, leaning up against the railings, and selecting a straw to chew, fixed us with his eye. He evidently meant to see <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was quite}} easy in your case," [...] and a twinkle crept into his host's eyes. [...] "Your uncle's {{the same kind}} of a man as I am, and one can see you have been up against it since you came to this country. That's {{one of the best things}} that can happen to any young man. I guess it's not our fault we don't like all the young men they send us out from the Old Country." [...] He glanced down at his cigar. [...] "Well, I've pretty well smoked <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out.</b> It's the kind of cigar I was raised on, but I'm not allowed to use that kind {{anywhere}} in my house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There a'n't {{many men}} like Mr. Westover--well, {{not a great}} many; or Jackson, either. Time! I wish Jackson was home! He'd know how to {{straighten}} <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>out,</b> and he wouldn't weaken over Jeff much--well, not much. But he a'n't here, and you've got to act for yourself. The way I look at it is this: you took Jeff when you knowed what a comical devil he was, and I presume you ha'n't got quite the same right to be disappointed in what he done as if you hadn't knowed. Now mind, I a'n't excusin' him. But if you knowed he was the feller to play the devil if he got a chance, the question is whether--whether--" ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{like being}} home, having my routines, looking after my garden {{and playing with}} my dog, but I also love playing. I love {{being able to do}} both ... I don't know what will happen after this. I've got no plans at the moment. I'm going to see how <b>this</b> {{motherhood}} <b>thing</b> turns <b>out.</b> Higgins gave birth to her son, Samuel Arrow Lee, on 5 January 2015.|$|R
2500|$|Sullivan {{hosted a}} second {{appearance}} by Presley on October 28, 1956. Elvis performed [...] "Don't Be Cruel", then [...] "Love Me Tender". Sullivan then addressed {{the audience as}} he stood beside Elvis, who began shaking his legs, eliciting screams from the audience. By the time Sullivan turned his head, Elvis was standing motionless. After Presley left the stage, Sullivan stated, [...] "I can’t figure <b>this</b> darn <b>thing</b> <b>out.</b> You know. He just does this [...] and everybody yells." [...] Elvis appeared a second time in the show and sang [...] "Love Me". Later on, he sang a nearly four-minute-long version of [...] "Hound Dog" [...] and was shown in full the entire song.|$|R
5000|$|Some new {{programs}} which {{is dedicated to}} the youth,women,kids,layman are launched in this year with new logo and shiledar maharashtrache and prerana puraskar are notable ones and special attractions of music programs like music track m2g2 makes this channel different from other but this channel does not holds the fixed timings of marathi feature films so dd has to note <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> and bring <b>out</b> the new and ethnic films to showcase in Sunday ...|$|R
