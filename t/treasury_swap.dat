40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} various factors {{underlying}} the pricing of US fixed income assets. In particular, we decompose movements in 10 -year <b>Treasury,</b> <b>swap,</b> agency and corporate yields into five unobserved factors: the risk-free interest rate, a credit risk factor, a liquidity preference factor, and idiosyncratic shocks affecting Treasury yields and swap rates, respectively. Our {{findings indicate that}} {{the relative importance of}} these factors has shifted in recent years, with significant implications for the information content of market interest rates. First, Treasury yields have become increasingly divorced from the risk-free rate due to an increase in the volatility of idiosyncratic Treasury shocks. Second, spreads between the yields on various fixed income securities have been increasingly influenced by a number of different factors, making them harder to interpret. 1...|$|E

This paper argues that the government might offer DC plan members a minimum return guarantee, funded by risk based premia. Option pricing formulas show that the guarantee could be quite expensive, but public provision could reduce the costs borne by workers.

40|$|This article {{develops}} a multi-factor econometric {{model of the}} term structure of interest-rate swap yields. The model accommodates the possibility of counterparty default, and any differences in the liquidities of the <b>Treasury</b> and <b>Swap</b> markets. By parameterizing a model of swap rates directly, the authors are able to compute model-based estimates of the defaultable zero-coupon bond rates implicit in the swap market without having to specify a priori the dependence of these rates on default hazard or recovery rates. The time series analysis of spreads between zero-coupon <b>swap</b> and <b>treasury</b> yields reveals that both credit and liquidity factors were important sources of variation in swap spreads over the past decade.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{critical}} survey of models designed for pricing fixed income securities and their associated term structures of market yields. Our primary {{focus is on the}} interplay between the theoretical specification of dynamic term structure models and their empirical fit to historical changes in the shapes of yield curves. We begin by over viewing the dynamic term structure models that have been fit to <b>treasury</b> or <b>swap</b> yield curves and in which the risk factors follow diffusions, jump-diffusion, or have regimes. " Then the goodness-of- ts of these models are assessed relative to their abilities to: (i) match linear projections of changes in yields onto the slope of the yield curve; (ii) match the persistence of conditional volatilities, and the shapes of term structures of unconditional volatilities, of yields; and (iii) to reliably price caps, swaptions, and other fixed-income derivatives.

Pricing and hedging is robust even in the underlying jumps. Using a large options panel data set on Treasury futures with different tenors, we report the following findings: First, the term structure of implied variances is downward sloping across maturities and increases in tenors. Moreover, {{the slope of the}} term structure is strongly linked to economic activity. Second, returns to the <b>Treasury</b> variance <b>swap</b> are negative and economically large. Shorting a variance swap produces an annualized Sharpe ratio of almost two and the associated returns cannot be explained by standard risk factors.

40|$|We {{study how}} the market prices the default and {{liquidity}} risks incorporated {{into one of}} the most important credit spreads in the financial markets–interest rate swap spreads. Our approach consists of jointly modeling the <b>Treasury,</b> repo, and <b>swap</b> term structures using a general five-factor aﬃne credit framework and estimating the parameters by maximum likelihood. We find that the credit spread is driven by changes in a persistent liquidity process and a rapidly mean-reverting default intensity process. Although both processes have similar volatilities, we find that the credit premium priced into swap rates is primarily compensation for liquidity risk. The term structure of liquidity premia increases steeply with maturity. In contrast, the term structure of default premia is almost flat. However, both liquidity and default premia vary significantly over time...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} ability of three-factor affine term-structure models to extract {{conditional}} volatility using interest rate swap yields for 1991 - 2005 and Treasury yields for 1970 - 2003. For the Treasury sample, the correlation between model-implied and EGARCH volatility is between 60 % and 75 %. For the swap sample, this correlation is rather low or negative. We find that these differences in model performance are primarily due to {{the timing of the}} swap sample, and not to institutional differences between <b>swap</b> and <b>Treasury</b> markets. We conclude that {{the ability of}} multifactor affine models to extract conditional volatility depends on the sample period, but that overall these models perform better than has been argued in the literature.

40|$|Existing {{models of}} the term {{structure}} of interest rate swap yields assume a unique regime for the data generating process and ascribe variations in swap-Treasury yield spread to default risk or to liquidity premium. However, the interest rate swap market {{has been marked by}} economic events and institutional changes that might have significant effects on the data generating process, and thus on the relationship between the swap spread and its determining factors. We investigate the stability {{of the relationship between the}} swap spread and its determining factors with the structural change econometric techniques of Bai and Perron (1998). The structural change tests produce endogenous break dates and associated confidence intervals. We trace the break dates to events related to liquidity, default, and institutional changes in the swap market. We find that default risk is an important source of variation of the swap spread at the beginning of the sample period, but is relatively less important at the end. Liquidity is, by contrast, more important towards the end of the sample period. Since these results call into question the assumption of one regime, we propose and estimate a joint <b>Treasury</b> and <b>swap</b> term structure model that accommodates regime switching. Evidence from the maximum likelihood estimation provides considerable support for the regime switching model. Consequently, the implied swap spreads may differ greatly across regimes. This finding suggests that the failure to account for regime shifts may result in significant mispricing of corporate debt, mortgage-backed securities, as well as derivatives that increasingly use the swap spread as a benchmark for pricing and hedging...|$|R
40|$|The {{changing}} {{information content}} of market interest rates 1 Most central banks {{rely on a}} variety of information sources in forming their outlook for the economy and, accordingly, assessing the stance of monetary policy. Important among those sources are quotes on financial market instruments, because they are critical links in the monetary policy transmission mechanism, because they embed expectations about the future course of monetary policy and the economy, and because they are available on a realtime basis. However, many different factors potentially influence the prices of financial instruments, including movements in risk-free interest rates, perceptions about the risks of various assets and changes in the value that investors place on liquidity. Thus, extracting information from those prices can be difficult. This paper attempts to provide some insight into the behaviour of key long-term interest rates in the United States since 1993 by parsing their movements into those of more fundamental underlying factors. In particular, the analysis decomposes the variations in five key market rates into factors representing the risk-free interest rate, liquidity preference and credit risk, as well as idiosyncratic shocks to the <b>Treasury</b> and <b>swap</b> markets. Concentrating on these underlying factors, rather than the market interest rates themselves, brings financial market developments over that period into sharper focus. The results indicate that the importance of individual factors has shifted in recent years, with significant consequences for the information content of market interest rates and, presumably, the appropriate investment and hedging strategies of private investors. Among other findings, it appears that Treasury yields have varied more as a result of shocks specific to that market in recent years, and that corporate yield spreads have increasingly been affected by factors other than credit risk. 1 The authors are {{on the staff of the}} Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} studies {{the impact of}} {{variance}} risk in the Treasury market on both term premia and {{the shape of the}} yield curve. Under minimal assumptions shared by standard structural and reduced-form asset pricing models, I show that an observable proxy of variance risk in the Treasury market can be constructed via a portfolio of Treasury options. The observable variance risk has the ability to explain the time variation in term premia, but is largely unrelated to the shape of the yield curve. Using the observable variance risk, I also propose a new representation of no-arbitrage term structure models. All the pricing factors in the model are observable, tradable, and hence economically interpretable. The representation can also accommodate both unspanned macro risks and unspanned stochastic volatility in the term structure literature. The second chapter shows that it is beneficial to incorporate a particular zero-cost trading strategy into approaches that extract a stochastic discount factor from asset prices in a model-free manner (e. g. the Hansen-Jagannathan minimum variance stochastic discount factor). The strategy mimics the Radon-Nikodym derivative between two pricing measures with alternative investment horizons, and is hence characterized by the term structure of the SDF (or the dynamics of the SDF). Incorporating the strategy into the Euler equation significantly enhances the ability of the extracted stochastic discount factor to explain crosssectional variation of expected asset returns. Furthermore, the strategy remarkably tightens various lower bounds for the stochastic discount factor, hence setting a more stringent hurdle for equilibrium asset pricing models. The third chapter studies variance risk premiums in the Treasury market. We first develop a theory to price variance swaps and show that the realized variance can be perfectly replicated by a static position in Treasury futures options and a dynamic position in the underlying. Pricing and hedging is robust even if the underlying jumps. Using a large options panel data set on Treasury futures with different tenors, we report the following findings: First, the term-structure of implied variances is downward sloping across maturities and increases in tenors.
