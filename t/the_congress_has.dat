5000|$|Democrats were {{successful}} in portraying <b>the</b> <b>congress</b> as a lazy, greedy, egotistical and inefficient [...] "Do-Nothing Congress.", which they contrasted with their [...] "New Direction for America" [...] campaign. Indeed, <b>the</b> <b>congress</b> <b>had</b> been in session much less than previous ones had (including those under Republican control), and numerous public opinion polls showed that large majorities believed that <b>the</b> <b>congress</b> <b>had</b> accomplished less than normal. This too, took a toll on Republicans (as {{the leaders of the}} government).|$|R

25|$|In an {{alternative}} opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia {{objected to the}} Court's consideration of the case {{with respect to the}} Taxpayer Relief Act, finding no party in the case with standing to challenge it. However, he did find a party with standing to challenge the President's cancellation in the Balanced Budget Act, and concluded that it did not violate the Constitution, because <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> the power to delegate the discretionary authority to decline to spend appropriated sums of money, which he asserted was equivalent to cancellation.|$|E
25|$|Also, in {{addition}} to this combination of clauses being used to uphold federal laws affecting economic activity, they also were used to justify federal criminal laws. For example, Congress in the Federal Kidnapping Act made it a federal crime to transport a kidnapped person across state lines, because the transportation would be an act of interstate activity over which <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> power. It has also provided justification {{for a wide range of}} criminal laws relating to interference with the federal government's rightful operation, including federal laws against assaulting or murdering federal employees.|$|E

India is now as one of the single largest aid donors to Afghanistan.|$|E

25|$|Although {{procedures}} {{in each state}} vary slightly, the electors generally follow a similar series of steps, and <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> constitutional authority to regulate the procedures the states follow. The meeting is opened by the election certification official – often that state's secretary of state or equivalent – who reads the Certificate of Ascertainment. This document sets forth who was chosen to cast the electoral votes. The attendance of the electors is taken and any vacancies are noted in writing. The next step is {{the selection of a}} president or chairman of the meeting, sometimes also with a vice chairman. The electors sometimes choose a secretary, often not himself an elector, to take the minutes of the meeting. In many states, political officials give short speeches {{at this point in the}} proceedings.|$|E
25|$|Several {{bills have}} been {{introduced}} in Congress to grant the District of Columbia voting representation in one or both houses of Congress. As detailed above, the primary issue with all legislative proposals is whether <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> the constitutional authority to grant the District voting representation. Members of Congress {{in support of the}} bills claim that constitutional concerns should not prohibit the legislation's passage, but rather should be left to the courts. A secondary criticism of a legislative remedy is that any law granting representation to the District could be undone in the future. Additionally, recent legislative proposals deal with granting representation in the House of Representatives only, which would still leave the issue of Senate representation for District residents unresolved. Thus far, no bill granting the District voting representation has passed both houses of Congress. A summary of legislation proposed since 2003 is provided below.|$|E

25|$|In 2007 Donnelly was a cosponsor of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIP). Appropriating over $60 {{billion over}} 5 years by {{matching}} {{federal funds to}} states that provide health insurance to children and pregnant women, and raising the federal cigarette tax from 39 cents to $1. After CHIP passed the House and the Senate, President George W. Bush vetoed the bill over a $30 billion spending difference between what he and congress proposed, saying that “Because <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> chosen to send me a bill that moves {{our health care system}} in the wrong direction, I must veto it,” and that lawmakers should “produce a good bill that puts poorer children first.” After Bush's decision on CHIP, Donnelly joined 217 Democrats and 42 Republicans in a failed measure to override Bush's veto. In 2009 after Bush left office, the House passed a new version of CHIP, and President Barack Obama signed it into law. The new version including the original expansion of coverage to 4 million children, and along with raising taxes on cigarettes, a new provision was added to raise taxes on other tobacco products.|$|E
500|$|Vinson's opinion also {{addressed}} {{the contention that}} Medina's jury instructions were faulty. The defendants claimed that Medina's statement that [...] "as matter of law that there is sufficient danger of a substantive evil that <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> a right to prevent to justify {{the application of the}} statute under the First Amendment of the Constitution" [...] was erroneous, but Vinson concluded that the instructions were an appropriate interpretation of the Smith Act.|$|E
500|$|Several tax protesters {{assert that}} <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> no {{constitutional}} {{power to tax}} labor or income from labor, citing a variety of court cases.

500|$|In {{regards to}} Tharoor's removal {{from the post}} of {{congress}} spokesperson, The Telegraph (Calcutta) opined, “For an Opposition MP to have and to exercise the freedom to appreciate a good thing done {{by the government and}} for a ruling party MP to speak and vote against the party line is not just legitimate parliamentary practice, it is the very essence of parliamentary democracy. Shashi Tharoor, from the ranks of <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> tried to do that; there is not one BJP MP who has matched him. Blind conformism is not loyalty, nor independent thinking, dissent.” ...|$|E
500|$|Some protesters {{have argued}} that because the Sixteenth Amendment does not contain the words [...] "repeal" [...] or [...] "repealed", the Amendment is {{ineffective}} to change the law. [...] Others argue that due to language in Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., the income tax is an unconstitutional direct tax that should be apportioned (divided equally amongst {{the population of the}} various states). [...] Several tax protesters assert that <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> no constitutional power to tax labor or income from labor, citing a variety of court cases. These arguments include claims that the word [...] "income" [...] as used in the Sixteenth Amendment cannot be interpreted as applying to wages; that wages are not income because labor is exchanged for them; that taxing wages violates individuals' right to property, and several others.|$|E
500|$|Should the Vice President and a {{majority}} of the Cabinet believe the President is still [...] "unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office", they may within four days of the President's declaration submit another declaration that the President is incapacitated. If not already in session, the Congress must then assemble within 48 hours. <b>The</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> 21 days to decide the issue. If within the 21 days two-thirds of each house of Congress vote that the President is incapacitated, the Vice President would [...] "continue" [...] to be Acting President. Should the Congress resolve the issue in favor of the President, or make no decision within the 21 days allotted, then the President would [...] "resume" [...] discharging the powers and duties of his office. The use of the words [...] "continue" [...] and [...] "resume" [...] imply that the Vice President remains Acting President while Congress deliberates.|$|E
50|$|Although the Insular Cases had {{established}} that the Constitution does not wholly apply to territories, Burger cited Mullaney v. Anderson, , for the proposition that <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> authority to extend greater constitutional protections to a territory than would otherwise apply. <b>The</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>had,</b> in 1952, authorized Puerto Rico to write its own constitution, which included language identical to the Fourth Amendment. Burger {{also noted that the}} Court had applied other federal constitutional protections, such as free speech and due process, to Puerto Rico. Burger's opinion leaves explicitly undecided whether the Fourth Amendment here applied directly, or through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|R
2500|$|Justice Thurgood Marshall {{argued that}} the term [...] "national security" [...] was too broad to legitimize prior restraint, and also argued {{that it is not}} the Court's job to create laws where <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>had</b> not spoken.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 the Supreme Court ruled, in Hamdam v. Rumsfeld, {{that the}} President lacked the {{constitutional}} authority {{to set up}} military commissions. The ruling clarified that only <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> authority to set up military commissions.|$|R
