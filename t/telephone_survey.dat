5|$|By early April, pro-Heiner ads from Citizens for a Sound Government revived {{charges of}} taking bailouts and tax {{delinquency}} against Bevin and attacked Comer for accepting {{thousands of dollars}} in farm subsidies. Within days, the candidates appeared at a debate where Bevin challenged Heiner to publicly denounce the ads; Heiner responded with a silent smile. Bevin's public challenge to the ad prompted a Lexington television station to pull it after two weeks on the air. Bevin made a $200,000 combined television and radio ad buy to defend himself against the ads and began a <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> that touted his conservative credentials while highlighting Heiner's past positions on issues such as gun control before asking how these statements affect the person's view of each candidate. Heiner said the survey was a negative push poll, but Bevin insisted it was a legitimate poll. By the end of April, polls showed that Heiner's lead had evaporated and that the race was essentially a three-way dead heat between him, Bevin, and Comer.|$|E

Complaints about its current location include diplomats who find it difficult to obtain visas from the United States and local residents complaining of inconveniences whenever the surrounding roads are closed due to visiting dignitaries as well as the high costs to the city. A <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> in 2001 found that 67% of respondents favor moving the United Nations headquarters out of the country. Countries critical of the USA, such as Iran and Russia, are especially important in questioning the current location of the United Nations.

40|$|Recently, {{the leading}} {{position}} of <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys</b> {{as the major}} mode of data collection has been challenged. <b>Telephone</b> <b>surveys</b> suffer from a growing nonresponse, {{partly due to the}} general nonresponse trend for all surveys and partly due to changes in society and technology influencing contactability and willingness to answer. One way to counteract the increasing nonresponse is the use of an advance letter. In mail and face-to-face surveys, advance letters have been proven effective. Based on the proven effectiveness in face-to-face and mail surveys, survey handbooks advise the use of advance letters in <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys.</b> This study reviews the evidence for this advice and presents a quantitative summary of empirical studies on the effectiveness of advance letters in raising the response rate for <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys.</b> The major conclusion is that advance letters are also an effective tool in <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys,</b> with an average increase in response rate (RR 1) from 58 percent (no letter) to 66 percent (advance letter), and an average increase in cooperation rate (COOP 1) from 64 percent (no letter) to 75 percent (advance letter) ...|$|R

5|$|Despite the orders, a {{relatively}} small number of people evacuated for the hurricane. According to a <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> conducted by the United States Department of Commerce, the highest participation rate was for residents in the Northern Neck in areas potentially affected by the storm surge from a Category2 hurricane, of which 41% in the survey stated they left their houses for a safer location. In Surry, only 9% of those in a Category2 hurricane storm surge zone left. 30% who participated in the survey along the Eastern Shore left. The primary reasons for the choice whether to evacuate or not were due to the track of Isabel, its strength, or influence from the media. Most participants in the survey stated they did not hear any sort of evacuation notice from public officials in their location, however. Of those who evacuated, about 64% left for the house of a friend or a relative, with about 24% evacuating to a hotel or a motel. Most of those in Hampton and Norfolk left for elsewhere in the state, while the majority of those in the Northern Neck evacuated to destinations in their own neighborhood or community. The evacuation destinations on the Eastern Shore of Virginia were varied, with 23% leaving for Maryland and 46% staying in their own neighborhood or community. The length of the evacuation process varied between a few hours to two days, with the worst evacuation problems being closed or flooded roads. The Virginia Army National Guard and State Police troopers assisted in the evacuations. In all, more than 160,000 residents in southeastern Virginia were told to evacuate, including 11,000 in vulnerable locations along the Chesapeake Bay and all residents in mobile home parks in Chesapeake and Newport News. A total of about 16,325people evacuated to 67 shelters. Some of the reported problems were shortages of supplies, unanticipated medical issues, overcrowding, and lack of security.|$|E

40|$|D'URING {{the past}} few years, a minor {{revolution}} {{has taken place in}} <b>survey</b> research. <b>Telephone</b> <b>surveys</b> based on some form of random digit dialing (RDD) have gained general acceptance among much of the survey community as a legitimate method for sampling public opinion. Not too long ago, <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys</b> were viewed with skepticism or outright distrust. Backstrom and Hursch (1963 : 138) explicitly warned their readers to avoid this method.

Therefore, among other centers, the Public Opinion Poll Center (POPC) adopted the dual frame <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys</b> {{as an alternative to}} the landline <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys,</b> in which the landline sample is supplemented by a Pseudo-Random-Digit-Dial (Pseudo-RDD) sample of cell phones. The cell phone sample can reach the cell-only households (households with no landline but are accessible by cell phone), about 66. 7 percent, based on the 2012 / 2013 Egypt HIECS data; this contributes to reducing the potential coverage bias due to not covering these households in the landline <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys.</b> Although both are telephone samples, different weighting procedures may apply for each sample. Moreover, the overlapping between the two sampling frame should be properly identified and adjusted in the weighting procedures. In this paper, sampling design and weighting procedures for the dual frame <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys</b> in Egypt will be discussed.

40|$|Until quite recently, <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys</b> have {{typically}} relied on landline telephone numbers. However, {{with the increasing}} popularity and affordability of mobile phones, {{there has been a}} surge in households that do not have landline connections. Additionally, there has been a decline in the response rates and population coverage of landline <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys,</b> creating a challenge to collecting representative social data. Dual-frame <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys</b> that use both landline and mobile phone sampling frames can overcome the incompleteness of landline-only <b>telephone</b> sampling. However, <b>surveying</b> mobile phone users introduces new complexities in sampling, nonresponse measurement and statistical weighting. This article examines these issues and illustrates the consequences of failing to include mobile-phone-only users in <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys</b> using data from Australia. Results show that there are significant differences in estimates of populations’ characteristics when using information solely from the landline or mobile telephone sample. These biases in the population estimates are significantly reduced when data from the mobile and landline samples are combined and appropriate dual-frame survey estimators are used. The optimal choice of a dual-frame estimation strategy depends on the availability of good-quality information that can account for the differential patterns of nonresponse by frame...|$|R
