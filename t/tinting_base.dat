Cross-blendedhypsometric tints, introduced in 2009, are a partial solution to this problem. Theyuse variable lowland colors customized to match the differing natural environmentsof world regions, which merge into one another.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 118 - 123) Very {{little work}} has been done by cartographers toward a precise description of how map users perceive numerousness on dot maps. This study, in order to investigate some of the problems in this area, incorporated three tests designed to examine the perceptual characteristics of dot maps in general along with the effects of anchors (legends), variable dot size, and selected figure-ground relationships. In addition, a fourth test was carried out to detect possible design bias in the first three tests and to measure the effect of the subjects' backgrounds on previous results. All of the tests in this study consisted of dot maps designed and executed to have characteristics similar to those commonly used in geographic study. Subjects were given these maps and asked to estimate dot numbers in selected areas. The results of these tests indicated that in general people underestimate dot numbers and are relatively insensitive to variation in density. Anchors, along with dot sizes smaller than those normally employed and lightly <b>tinted</b> <b>base</b> data were all found to improve perceptual accuracy. The fourth test detected little design bias in the first three tests and established that the perceptual characteristics of various populations are very similar when divided along lines of class rank or area of study...|$|R

40|$|This project {{consists}} of two parts. One area of focus {{in the first part}} is understanding the interactions between a non-ionic, block copolymer type dispersant and hydrophobically-modified, ethoxylated urethane (HEUR) associative thickeners in water. The dispersant was mixed at various concentrations (0 - 2 % by weight) with HEUR thickeners at 1 % by weight concentration in the aqueous medium. This study {{is an integral part of}} our attempts to determine mechanisms of viscosity drop when colorant dispersions are added to latex <b>tint</b> <b>base</b> formulations thickened with associative thickeners. One of the HEUR thickeners is a product that has been available for over three decades (HEUR RM- 825), whereas the other, HEUR RM- 995 is a product recently introduced to minimize the <b>tint</b> <b>base</b> viscosity drop. The old HEUR showed a definitive viscosity maximum as a function of the dispersant concentration. However, the new generation product did not indicate a viscosity maximum within the dispersant concentration range studied; instead it showed a small, but linear increase in viscosity as dispersant level was increased. The next area of focus was on understanding the phase behavior, rheology, and interactions between polymer latex particles and a hydrophobically-modified, ethoxylated urethane (HEUR) associative thickener in water. The influence of the addition of surfactant in some of the systems was also studied. Several types of dispersions were made using two types of polymer latex, two associative thickeners, and two surfactants. Mixtures containing a small particle size acrylic latex and HEUR RM- 825 exhibited the most interesting and complex phase behavior and rheology. In experiments wherein the latex particle volume fraction was kept constant, the addition of HEUR caused stable, followed by phase separated (syneresis) and stable mixtures as HEUR concentration was increased. The observed phase behavior is consistent with previous work reported by other investigators. However, detailed rheological data on systems such as these have not been reported, and this report presents the rheological data and correlate rheology with the phase behavior. The stable latex-HEUR mixtures at low HEUR levels show shear-thinning viscosity with well-defined low-shear Newtonian plateaus. As HEUR level is increased wherein syneresis is observed, erratic rheological profiles with shear-thickening are observed. When HEUR level is increased to a region where no syneresis is observed, low shear Newtonian plateaus re-appeared albeit at higher viscosities. The effects of added non-ionic and anionic surfactants on the dispersion are also studied. The main focus of the second part of this project is hybrid organic-inorganic photovoltaics. They have been the focus of recent studies due to their promising use in low-cost, flexible electronics, which can be processed from solution by printing and coating techniques. Understanding the rheology of these nanocomposites is essential in controlling shear flows during printing and application processes. Through rheology, we can determine different properties of poly(3 -hexylthiophene) and dodecanethiol (DDT) modified zinc oxide (ZnO-DDT). Semiconductor nanowires such as ZnO have rigid or rod-like macromolecule geometry. Therefore, they have a tendency to have a lytropic liquid crystal (LLC) phase. LLC orders occur spontaneously in solutions with rod-shaped or anistropic objects from isotropic phase to nematic phase above a critical volume fraction which was studied using ZnO-DDT. The shear-induced alignment of the liquid crystal molecules was analyzed, serving as a guide for LLC printing. Furthermore by using this nanocomposite we are able to induced gelation using the ZnO-DDT nanowires in what is considered as a “good solvent,” dichlorobenzene. The kinetics of this gelation process was determined to be of first-order reaction kinetics. Furthermore, a mechanism of this gelation process is also presented...|$|R

5000|$|In the Middle Ages, {{based on}} a {{mistranslation}} from the Arabic term for bitumen, {{it was thought that}} mummies possessed healing properties. As a result, it became common practice to grind Egyptian mummies into a powder to be sold and used as medicine. When actual mummies became unavailable, the sun-desiccated corpses of criminals, slaves and suicidal people were substituted by mendacious merchants. The practice developed into a wide-scale business that flourished until the late 16th century. Two centuries ago, mummies were still believed to have medicinal properties to stop bleeding, and were sold as pharmaceuticals in powdered form as in mellified man. Artists also made use of Egyptian mummies; a brownish pigment known as mummy brown, based on mummia (sometimes called alternatively caput mortuum, Latin for death's head), which was originally obtained by grounding human and animal Egyptian mummies. It was most popular in the 17th century, but was discontinued in the early 19th century when its composition became generally known to artists who replaced the said pigment by a totally different blend -but keeping the original name, mummia or mummy brown-yielding a similar <b>tint</b> and <b>based</b> on ground minerals (oxides and fired earths) and or blends of powdered gums and oleoresins (such as myrrh and frankincense) as well as ground bitumen.

5000|$|Scenically the production, {{designed}} by Harry Horner, was extremely involved with velour covered hard wall sets instead of typical muslin flats. The raised stage platform floor concealed tracks {{for the various}} platform wagon sets to be winched on and off stage. The village set, included left and right store facades with false perspective awnings, were stored, hanging in the off stage loft areas, allowing wing storage for the hard wall throne room (painted deep maroon color); a pink boudoir set; a garden set; and a Cathedral Rose stained glass window-wall with a central enlarged double Gothic arched doorway mounted on a six foot deep by thirty foot wide wagon platform. Staging the wedding scene, the couple began their walk {{at the rear of}} the stage on the Cathedral steps into the set. As the couple proceeded walking forward down to the foot-light apron, this massive Cathedral wall followed, moving with the couple to the middle of the stage. Interesting is fact the audience never realized that the set was moving downstage with the performers. When the couple turned around, returning upstage, the cathedral wall slowly returned to the back wall position ending the wedding scene. This set wagon wall flew out and was stored against the Curran's stage back wall; a spectacular visual transition, which was never seen by the audience! In Los Angeles, this set piece was replaced with a painted velour framed backing. Harry Horner matched Miles White's costume color, for Princess Flavia's dressing gown robe, spraying the velour boudoir walls the identical costume's pink color. During rehearsals, Miles was jump'n mad with Harry because all you could see was the actress' head bobbing in the identical pink background! The production required a large staff of stage technicians, flymen, and property crew for the major set changes. During the construction of the stage sets, the shop's minimum construction floor space limited and hindered by space for constructing all the wagon sets. The Light Opera rented film stages at the nearby (closed) Allied Artist Studios, located off Sunset Boulevard (KCET TV purchased the property afterwards). Only six blocks travel, carpenters and scenic artists assembled the scenery in two stages at the old film lot. Preparing the dry <b>tint</b> powder <b>base</b> paint for the throne room set, the Scenic charge man did not calculate the correct amount of [...] "horse glue" [...] binder for the dark maroon paint. Spraying the cream velour covered flats, after drying, the paint did not properly adhere to the velour flats. The result, the paint flaked and stained the stage technicians' hands. Each piece of scenery had to have a muslin case for shipping, keeping the finish from marking and affecting the other pieces of scenery. When this set was handled, each stage technician had to wear gloves when the set was moved into place, or shifted off stage for storage. This set remained a problem throughout the tour. Another folding deminsional scenic arch unit, which had been intended to fold open, and collapse when flown into grid storage position returning into the loft storage areas, became an engineering nightmare. The scenic element, abandoned after two weeks, was replaced by a flat profile garden arch. Harry Horner's scenery and Miles White's costumes provided an intricate, beautiful, handsome detailed production. Film sets and costumes as a stage musical! ...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. September 2015. Major: Food Science. Advisor: Theodore Labuza. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); liv, 628 pages. Discoloration of cured meats {{in the retail}} case is a concern for prepackaged sandwich manufacturers, resulting in negative consumer perceptions of quality and freshness, and decreased purchase intent. The introduction of Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) has significantly improved color appearance and increased the refrigerated shelf life, {{but it has not}} eliminated cured meat discoloration from developing. Consumer demand to see the product has led to greater product exposure to light, resulting in cured meat discoloration via photooxidation. The mechanism of photooxidation of cured meats is not fully understood, and there are multiple factors to consider including package variables (residual oxygen, Oxygen Transmission Rates (OTR), and product to headspace ratio), storage and display conditions (frozen followed by refrigeration, light exposure), and challenges created by the combination of bread, meat and cheese for a 30 day refrigerated shelf life in order to find practical, cost effective solutions for the prepackaged sandwich industry that are acceptable to the consumer. Using a bestselling ham & cheese sandwich variety in conjuncture with a 80 % N 2 / 20 % CO 2 Modified Atmosphere Package, a number of potential solutions are evaluated including ferrous and nonferrous based oxygen scavengers, UV (ultraviolet) blocking films, ham formulations and LED vs. fluorescent lighting to understand the impact to cured meat color scores in the form of L*and a* color measurements, visual appearance, and residual oxygen over time. Solutions demonstrating visual improvements or better color stability on L* or a* color values are presented to consumers for preference and input. The results of the study show that Ferrous based oxygen scavengers have potential, but challenges are created when used in a frozen storage and distribution system followed by refrigerated display. While predicted a* values in a scavenger/MAP packaged ham are higher (more red) over time compared to MAP only, the high variability found in initial meat color, compounded by variability in package oxygen content and changing conditions in the package over time results in no statistical differences due to predicted overlapping a* rate constants. The impact to L* (lightness and darkness) values are measurable and correlate with observed consumer preferences, but inconsistent throughout the refrigerated shelf life, with the potential for scavenger sachet packaged ham sandwiches to develop low L* (darkening) values that are unacceptable to the consumer. As a result, consumer preference for sandwiches with and without an O 2 scavenger is inconsistent at different days throughout the shelf life. Consumer input on active packaging reveals the need for further understanding of acceptance in a retail environment where the demand for fresher products continues to grow. While unaided, the sachet is initially unnoticed by consumers implying acceptance, awareness of its presence leads to concerns over freshness. The added cost of a scavenger requires recovering lost sales of 80, 000 sandwiches per year, but brand perception also needs to be considered. Grey <b>tinted</b> ferrous <b>based</b> scavenging film was not accepted and viewed as an attempt to hide qualities of the food. Consumer demand for higher quality ham with full muscle appearance and texture along with the many unknown factors in cured meat pigment formation and photooxidation mechanism makes ham reformulation not a practical approach. Use of LED lights and UV blocking films in the UV range of 366 – 400 nm that is detrimental to meat pigments did not result in improved color scores or visual appearance, validating that visible light is as equally destructive to meat color. As a result of this study, no changes are recommended to the current MAP package in a frozen storage and distribution with direction for future studies provided...|$|R
