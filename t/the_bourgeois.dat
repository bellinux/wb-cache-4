5|$|In 1833 Balzac {{released}} Eugénie Grandet, {{his first}} best-seller. The {{tale of a}} young lady who inherits her father's miserliness, it also became the most critically acclaimed book of his career. The writing is simple, yet the individuals (especially <b>the</b> <b>bourgeois</b> title character) are dynamic and complex.|$|E
5|$|Historian Sandra Mass {{considers}} the Rommel myth a hero cult, {{a synthesis of}} old and new hero cults and traditions culled primarily from Germany's largely imaginary colonial past, in particular the proletarian hero cult originally represented by Carl Peters and <b>the</b> <b>bourgeois</b> one represented by Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. Rommel, as portrayed by this hero cult, was both chivalrous and ruthless, young and old, harsh and gentle, strong and righteous. Calder, Duffy and Ricci opine that Rommel's military brilliance provoked a masochistic tendency to romanticise a worthy opponent, that because he was skilled at his profession, he must have been an anti-Nazi hero.|$|E

5|$|Det norske Arbeiderforbund was {{supported}} by people from individual factories, but the mainly philanthropic activists {{were associated with the}} Liberal Party. However, the strike at Akers Mekaniske had been a failure, as the laborers had returned to work by on 26 Augustwith a 10% pay cut. It soon faced competition from more worker-dominated trade unions, coordinated through the Fagforeningenes Centralkomite. On the political side, a Labour Party was formed in 1887, and from it the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions followed in 1899. The historical role of Det norske Arbeiderforbund, as it turned out, was to mark the transition between two kinds of trade unionism; the one dominated by <b>the</b> <b>bourgeois</b> Liberal Party and the one dominated by the socialist Labour Party. The organization became defunct around 1890. The publication Arbeideren was continued, and beginning in 1906, Arbeideren was the party organ of the newly founded Labour Democrats, a non-socialist labour and social reform party associated with the Liberal Party.|$|E

25|$|But the Hamadeh counter-attacked, helped most {{probably}} by local people from Bsharri and Hasroun. In their {{struggle against the}} Hamadeh that lasted from 1760 till 1772, <b>the</b> <b>bourgeois</b> Sheikhs of Jebbet Bsharri got {{the support of the}} Governors of Tripoli, Osman Pasha and his son Mohammad Pasha, of the Sunnite Sheikhs of Danniyeh and of the Sheikhs of Zawiyeh. In 1763, the ambitious Emir Youssef Al Shihabi (ruled afterwards Mount Lebanon from 1770 to 1789) installed in the Jbeil region and being himself in conflict with the Hamadeh, profited from the difficulties of <b>the</b> <b>Bourgeois</b> Sheikhs and maneuvered to take from them the collection of taxes in Jebbet Bsharri. He contracted an alliance with <b>the</b> <b>Bourgeois</b> Sheikhs and confirmed their privileges in the tax collection of their districts as well as their right to claim the abandoned properties of the Hamadeh (Baklik). The fight with the Hamadeh will continue for 12 years. It will lead to their eviction from the whole region and to their final defeat in 1772. The Emir Youssef Al Shihabi, and his Shihabis successors, will have the direct rule of Jebbet Bsharri for almost one century from 1763 till 1844, helped by the new generation of Bourgeois Village Sheiks of Jebbet Bsharri: El Douaihy, Estephane, Awwad and Daher, but also Khattar and Issa Al Khoury.|$|E
25|$|Schiller is {{considered}} by most Germans to be Germany's most important classical playwright. Critics like F.J.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>bourgeois,</b> {{or members}} {{of the middle class}} of Paris, financiers, merchants, shopkeepers, artisans, and those in the liberal professions (doctors, lawyers, accountants, teachers, {{government}} officials) were a growing social class. They were specifically defined by law as persons who had lived in the city at least a year in their own residence, and earned enough money to pay taxes. In 1780, there were an estimated 25,000 Paris households who fell into this category, about fourteen percent of the total. Many of those in the upper middle class rose from modest social origins to amass very large fortunes. Many of the wealthiest bourgeois built their own palatial town houses in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the Montmartre quarter, the banking center of the city, or close to the Palais Royal. The upper middle class, once they had made their fortunes, frequently lived by buying the debts and collecting rentes from the nobility and the government, which during the 18th century were both always short of cash. While the nobles tended to dress in rich and elaborate costumes and bright colors, <b>the</b> <b>bourgeois</b> wore rich fabrics but dark and sober colors. <b>The</b> <b>bourgeois</b> played a very active role in each neighborhood; they were the leaders of the religious confréries which organized charitable and religious activities for each profession, managed the finances of the parish churches, and ran the corporations which governed each profession in Paris.|$|E
25|$|In 1272, Ponthieu with Abbeville, {{passed by}} {{marriage}} to the Kings of England, but Philip V took over the city, claiming that Edward II of England had not fulfilled its duty of vassal. Edward II complied with the feudal law, and Abbeville fell under English rule. However many challenges rose between <b>the</b> <b>bourgeois</b> and their new masters.|$|E
25|$|The only class, {{according}} to Engels, which is free from these restraints of property, {{and as a}} result from the danger of moral decay, is the proletariat, as they lack the monetary means that are the basis of (as well as threat to) <b>the</b> <b>bourgeois</b> marriage. Monogamy is therefore guaranteed by the fact that theirs is a voluntary sex-love relationship.|$|E

25|$|Dada was an {{informal}} international movement, with participants in Europe and North America. The beginnings of Dada {{correspond to the}} outbreak of World War I. For many participants, the movement was a protest against <b>the</b> <b>bourgeois</b> nationalist and colonialist interests, which many Dadaists believed were {{the root cause of}} the war, and against the cultural and intellectual conformity—in art and more broadly in society—that corresponded to the war.|$|E
25|$|This outlook matched {{precisely}} Trotsky's {{theory of}} Permanent Revolution. Trotsky's Permanent Revolution had foreseen that {{the working class}} would not stop at <b>the</b> <b>bourgeois</b> democratic stage of the revolution, but proceed towards a workers' state, as happened in 1917. The Polish Trotskyist Isaac Deutscher maintains that in 1917, Lenin changed his attitude to Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution and after the October revolution it {{was adopted by the}} Bolsheviks.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrival of}} the railway had a {{dramatic}} impact on Sandvika. First of all is spurred the centralization of many commercial activities in Sandvika, with the subsequent increase to population. Secondly the line cut through the town. This creased a social divide, with workers and craftsmen settling north of the station, and <b>the</b> <b>bourgeois</b> settling on the south side, along the fjord. The railway also brought some tourism with people on day trips from Oslo.|$|E
25|$|Negt and Kluge {{furthermore}} {{point out}} the necessity of considering a third dimension of the public spheres: The public spheres of production. The public spheres of production collect the impulses of resentment and instrumentalizes them in the productive spheres. The public spheres of production are wholly instrumental and have no critical impulse (unlike <b>the</b> <b>bourgeois</b> and proletarian spheres). The interests that are incorporated {{in the public sphere}} of production are given capitalist shape, and questions of their legitimately are thus neutralized.|$|E
