500|$|In {{a modern}} {{development}} of the tale the green children {{are associated with the}} Babes in the Wood, who were left by their wicked uncle to die; in this version the children's green colouration is explained by their having been poisoned with arsenic. Fleeing from the wood in which they were abandoned, possibly nearby Thetford Forest, the children fell into the pits at Woolpit where they were discovered. Local author and folk singer Bob Roberts states in his 1978 book A Slice of Suffolk that [...] "I was told <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>people</b> in Woolpit who are 'descended from the green children', but nobody would tell me who they were!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{crossword puzzle}} fad {{received}} extensive attention, {{not all of}} it positive: In 1924, The New York Times complained of the [...] "sinful waste in the utterly futile finding of words the letters of which will fit into a prearranged pattern, more or less complex. This is not a game at all, and it hardly can be called a sport... get nothing out of it except a primitive form of mental exercise, and success or failure in any given attempt is equally irrelevant to mental development." [...] A clergyman called the working of crossword puzzles [...] "the mark of a childish mentality" [...] and said, [...] "There is no use for persons to pretend that working one of the puzzles carries any intellectual value with it.". However, another wrote a complete [...] "Bible Cross-Word Puzzle Book". Also in 1925, Time Magazine noted that nine Manhattan dailies and fourteen other big newspapers were carrying crosswords, and quoted opposing views as to whether [...] "This crossword craze will positively end by June!" [...] or [...] "The crossword puzzle is here to stay!" [...] In 1925, The New York Times noted, with approval, a scathing critique of crosswords by The New Republic; but concluded that [...] "Fortunately, {{the question of whether the}} puzzles are beneficial or harmful is in no urgent need of an answer. The craze evidently is dying out fast and in a few months it will be forgotten." [...] and in 1929 declared, [...] "The cross-word puzzle, it seems, has gone the way of all fads...." [...] In 1930, a correspondent noted that [...] "Together with The Times of London, yours is the only journal of prominence that has never succumbed to the lure of the cross-word puzzle" [...] and said that [...] "The craze—the fad—stage has passed, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>people</b> numbering it to the millions who look for their daily cross-word puzzle as regularly as for the weather predictions." [...] The New York Times, however, was not to publish a crossword puzzle until 1942; today, the Times puzzle is one of the most popular in the country.|$|E

60|$|The list of {{the really}} serious, the really convinced, the really {{important}} and comprehensible people now alive includes, as most Englishmen would now be prepared to admit, the German Emperor. He is a practical man and a poet. I {{do not know whether}} <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>people</b> in existence who think there is some kind of faint antithesis between these two characters; but I incline to think there must be, because of the surprise which the career of the German Emperor has generally evoked. When he came to the throne it became at once apparent that he was poetical; people assumed in consequence that he was unpractical; that he would plunge Europe into war, that he would try to annex France, that he would say he was the Emperor of Russia, that he would stand on his head in the Reichstag, that he would become a pirate on the Spanish Main. Years upon years have passed; he has gone on making speeches, he has gone on talking about God and his sword, he has poured out an ever increased rhetoric and æstheticism. And yet all the time people have slowly and surely realised that he knows what he is about, that {{he is one of the}} best friends of peace, that his influence on Europe is not only successful, but in many ways good, that he knows what world he is living in better than a score of materialists.|$|E
6000|$|If {{the reader}} has any doubts upon the point, let him imagine a time when, as used {{to happen in}} the days of our forefathers, almost {{everybody}} suffered from smallpox at some period of their lives, those escaping only whose blood was so fortified by nature that the disease could not touch them. Let him imagine a state of affairs--and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>people</b> living whose parents could remember it--when for a woman not to be pitted with smallpox was to give her some claim to beauty, however homely might be her features. Lastly, let him imagine what all this means: what terror walked abroad when it was common for smallpox to strike a family of children, and when the parents, themselves the survivors of similar catastrophes, knew well that before it left the house it would take its tithe of those beloved lives. Let him look at the brasses in our old churches and among the numbers of children represented on them as kneeling behind their parents; let him note what a large proportion pray with their hands open. Of these, the most, I believe, were cut off by smallpox. Let him search the registers, and they will tell the same tale. Let him ask old people of what their mothers told them when they were young of the working of this pestilence in their youth. Finally, let him consider how it comes about, if vaccination is a fraud, that some nine hundred and ninety-nine medical men out of every thousand, not in England only, but in all civilised countries, place so firm a belief in its virtue. Are the doctors of the world all mad, or all engaged in a great conspiracy to suppress the truth? ...|$|E
