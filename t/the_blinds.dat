After several minutes of teasing, Beyoncé approaches the detective, {{who is now}} smiling, and knocks a stack of papers off of his desk so she can rub against him.

The women move about to continue the dance elsewhere in the room, executing some hip-shaking moves. They later perform a chair-dancing routine with Beyoncé, and whip their hair back and forth. The video ends with a fade to black as Beyoncé approaches the man at his desk.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThree {{competing}} hypotheses {{have been}} proposed for the cortical representation of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot. These are: (i) the regions surrounding <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot maintain their spatial values; (ii) the opposite sides of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot are represented adjacently at the cortex, so that <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot is “sewn-up”; and (iii) <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot is sewn-up with compensation occurring in the immediate surround of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot, so that spatial values are distorted only in the immediate surround of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot. To distinguish between these hypotheses we used a two-dot alignment task, with the two dots straddling <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot at varying dot separations. Thresholds in the two-dot alignment task are limited by the cortical separation of the two dots. When thresholds for alignment across <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot are compared with thresholds over intact retina at the same eccentricity, the three hypotheses predict: (i) no change in thresholds; (ii) a lowering of thresholds; and (iii) a lowering of thresholds but only at separations slightly greater than the diameter of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot. Thresoolds across <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot were closely similar to thresholds across intact retina. The results do not support a sewing-up (with or without compensation) of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot. Rather, our {{results are consistent with}} a preservation of spatial values around <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot...|$|R

5|$|The reader {{progressively}} learns their history. Dobroselova originally {{lived in}} the country, but moved to St. Petersburg (which she hates) when her father lost his job. Her father becomes very violent and her mother severely depressed. Her father dies and they move in with Anna Fyodorovna, a landlady who was previously cruel to them but at least pretends to feel sympathy for their situation. Dobroselova is tutored by a poor student named Pokrovsky, whose drunken father occasionally visits. She eventually {{falls in love with}} Pokrovsky. She struggles to save a measly amount of money to purchase the complete works of Pushkin at the market for his birthday present, then allows his father to give the books to him instead, claiming that just knowing he received the books will be enough for her happiness. Pokrovsky falls ill soon after, and his dying wish is to see the sun and the world outside. Dobroselova obliges by opening <b>the</b> <b>blinds</b> to reveal grey clouds and dirty rain. In response Pokrovsky only shakes his head and then passes away. Dobroselova's mother dies shortly afterwards, and Dobroselova is left in the care of Anna for a time, but the abuse becomes too much and she goes to live with Fedora across the street.|$|E

40|$|We {{usually do}} not notice <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot, a receptor-free region on the retina. Stimuli {{extending}} through <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot appear filled in. However, if an object does not reach through but ends in <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot, it is perceived as "cut off" at the boundary. Here we show that even {{when there is no}} corresponding stimulation at opposing edges of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot, well known motion-induced position shifts also extend into <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot and elicit a dynamic filling-in process that allows spatial structure to be extrapolated into <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot. We presented observers with sinusoidal gratings that drifted into or out of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot, or flickered in counterphase. Gratings moving into <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot were perceived to be longer than those moving out of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot or flickering, revealing motion-dependent filling-in. Further, observers could perceive more of a grating's spatial structure inside <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot than would be predicted from simple filling-in of luminance information from <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot edge. This is evidence for a dynamic filling-in process that uses spatiotemporal information from the motion system to extrapolate visual percepts into the scotoma of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot. Our findings also provide further support for the notion that an explicit spatial shift of topographic representations contributes to motion-induced position illusions...|$|R

At Princes Gate the ground floor was devoted to his enormous art library, and therefore pictures were hung mainly on the first floor, well-spaced, as in a museum. Other rooms in the house, of course, also held pictures: for example, on the second floor there was a charmingly decorated room called the card-room, which was apparently rarely shown to visitors but in which, eventually, he hung his Tiepolos, and behind this was a private study, hung with a group of Impressionist pictures including a fine late Cézanne.|$|E

A number of episodes over many decades have provided anecdotal evidence of the Club's behaviour.

The manager explains that the sign refers for his errand boy, who runs to deliver hot water in a kettle whenever required. This alludes to a similar scene in Ray's Joi Baba Felunath (1979). In an interview with The Telegraph, Ghosh says that the way Vidya looks out and moves from window to window in the guest-house room is reminiscent of Ray's Charulata (1964), where the actress Madhabi Mukherjee enjoys glimpses of the outside world through <b>the</b> <b>blinds</b> of windows. He also {{acknowledges the}} influence of Mahanagar (1963), another Ray film noted for its portrayal of Kolkata. According to the director, he was inspired by particular scenes of Ray's Nayak (1966) to plan the portrayal of complex emotional issues between Vidya and the police officer Rana, especially Rana's awe in the presence of Vidya. Ghosh expresses his inspiration from Ray's Aranyer Dinratri (1970) in which Ray [...] "wanted the audience to be inside the car with the four guys all the time. So the camera never leaves the car."
