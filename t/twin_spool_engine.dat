40|$|A digital {{computer}} simulation {{of a mixed}} flow, <b>twin</b> <b>spool</b> turbofan <b>engine</b> was assembled to evaluate and improve the dynamic characteristics of the engine simulation to disturbance frequencies of at least 100 Hz. One dimensional forms of the dynamic mass, momentum and energy equations were used to model the engine. A TF 30 engine was simulated so that dynamic characteristics could be evaluated against results obtained from testing of the TF 30 engine at the NASA Lewis Research Center. Dynamic characteristics of the engine simulation were improved by modifying the compression system model.

While most of the problems may have eventually been resolved during a normal development program, the shortened development period, and the frequent changes by Eclipse, proved to be insurmountable obstacles.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} problem of developing verifiable stable control architectures for gas turbine engines. First, a nonlinear physics-based dynamic model of a <b>twin</b> <b>spool</b> turboshaft <b>engine</b> which drives a variable pitch propeller is developed. In this model, {{the dynamics of the}} engine are defined to be the two spool speeds, and the two control inputs to the system are fuel flow rate and prop pitch angle. Experimental results are used to verify the dynamic model of JetCat SPT 5 turboshaft engine. Based on the experimental data, performance maps of the engine components including propeller, high pressure compressor, high pressure, and low pressure turbines are constructed. The engine numerical model is implemented using Matlab. Second, a stable gain scheduled controller is described and developed for a gas turbine engine that drives a variable pitch propeller. A stability proof is developed for a gain scheduled closed-loop system using global linearization and linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques. Using convex optimization tools, a single quadratic Lyapunov function is computed for multiple linearizations near equilibrium and non-equilibrium points of the nonlinear closed-loop system. This approach guarantees stability of the closed-loop gas turbine engine system. To verify the stability of the closed-loop system on-line, an optimization problem is proposed which is solvable using convex optimization tools. Through simulations, we show the developed gain scheduled controller is capable to regulate a turboshaft engine for large thrust commands in a stable fashion with proper tracking performance. Third, a gain scheduled model reference adaptive control (GS-MRAC) concept for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear plants with constraints on the control inputs is developed and described. Specifically, adaptive state feedback for the output tracking control problem of MIMO nonlinear systems is studied. Gain scheduled reference model system is used for generating desired state trajectories, and the stability of this reference model is also analyzed using convex optimization tools. This approach guarantees stability of the closed-loop gain scheduled gas turbine engine system, which is used as a gain scheduled reference model. An adaptive state feedback control scheme is developed and its stability is proven, in addition to transient and steady-state performance guarantees. The resulting closed-loop system is shown to have ultimately bounded solutions with a priori adjustable bounded tracking error. The results are then extended to GS-MRAC with constraints on the magnitudes of multiple control inputs. Sufficient conditions for uniform boundedness of the closed-loop system is derived. A semi-global stability result is proven with respect to the level of saturation for open-loop unstable plants, while the stability result is shown to be global for open-loop stable plants. Simulations are performed for three different models of the turboshaft engine, including the nominal engine model and two models where the engine is degraded. Through simulations, we show the developed GS-MRAC architecture can be used for the tracking problem of degraded turboshaft engine for large thrust commands with guaranteed stability. Finally, a decentralized linear parameter dependent representation of the engine model is developed, suitable for decentralized control of the engine with core and fan/prop subsystems. Control theoretic concepts for decentralized gain scheduled model reference adaptive control (D-GS-MRAC) systems is developed. For each subsystem, a linear parameter dependent model is available and a common Lyapunov matrix can be computed using convex optimization tools. With this control architecture, the two subsystems of the engine (i. e., engine core and engine prop/fan) can be controlled with independent controllers for large throttle commands in a decentralized manner. Based on this D-GS-MRAC architecture, a "plug and play" (PnP) technology concept for gas turbine engine control systems is investigated, which allows us to match different engine cores with different engine fans/propellers. With this plug and play engine control architecture, engine cores and fans/props could be used with their on-board subordinate controllers ready for integration into a functional propulsion system. Simulation results for three different models of the engine, including the nominal engine model, the model with a new prop, and the model with a new engine core, illustrate the possibility of PnP technology development for gas turbine engine control systems.

25|$|The {{arrays of}} {{airfoils}} {{are set in}} rows, usually as pairs: one rotating and one stationary. The rotating airfoils, also known as blades or rotors, accelerate the fluid. The stationary airfoils, also known as stators or vanes, decelerate and redirect the flow direction of the fluid, preparing it for the rotor blades of the next stage. Axial compressors are almost always multi-staged, with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial Mach number. Beyond about 5 stages or a 4:1 design pressure ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles (known as {{variable inlet guide vanes}} and variable stators), the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor (known as interstage bleed) and being split into more than one rotating assembly (known as <b>twin</b> <b>spools,</b> for example).|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{diagnosing}} component faults of jet engines is presented. It uses non-linear gas path analysis techniques {{to determine the}} values of health parameters, {{with the help of}} a suitably formulated engine simulation model. The incentive of the method is to achieve the determination of the values of component health indices when a limited number of measured quantities is available, which do not allow the determination of all the fault indices simultaneously. A combinatorial approach is introduced, in order to circumvent the problem of the insufficient information for determining a full set of indices. After obtaining a set of possible solutions, a selection procedure is applied to isolate the ones that can give the actual fault identify. Quantification of the fault comes at a final step, when the faulty component has been identified. Different scenarios of faults on a <b>twin</b> <b>spool</b> partially mixed turbofan engine are considered in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

This is achieved by optimizing a cost function which incorporates not only measurement matching terms, but also terms expressing various constraints resulting from the physical knowledge of the deterioration process. Time series of data representing deterioration scenarios are used to demonstrate the method's capabilities. The test case considered is a <b>twin</b> <b>spool</b> partially mixed turbofan, representative of present-day large civil aeroengines.

40|$|ABSTRACT Developments in {{the field}} of {{microturbine}} technology and gas turbine driven aircraft has been progressing without much progress in light aircraft predominantly propelled by piston engines. Because of inhibitive maintenance and overhaul costs of such however, propulsion via a gas turbine engine has been proposed with the potential of eventually replacing current engine configurations. Subsequently, the objective was to conceptually design a replacement gas turbine engine in the 150 kW range. A selection of case studies was used to illustrate the changing technologies to illustrate the technological viability of micro-gas turbines for light aircraft. Advantages and disadvantages of both engine types were discussed and a concise description of gas turbine operations and its components was given. A brief overview of fundamentals as well as the transmission layout was also supplied. Three configurations were isolated, namely the single <b>spool</b> design, a <b>twin</b> <b>spool</b> design featuring a free power turbine and the effect of a fuel conserving recuperator. Calculations were performed using Microsoft Excel, which proved sufficient in effectively calculating complex formulae - even under the necessary iterative feed-back conditions the design process demanded. Eventually, variable-specific design criteria were derived regarding the three engine types. Because fuel consumption still proved inhibitive, the effect of recuperation was investigated which yielded a very competitive engine - should the possibility of recuperator technology exist on time. As a result, one particular recuperated, single <b>spool</b> gas turbine <b>engine</b> was successfully identified. Having met all the design criteria sufficiently, this preliminary prototype design was numerically described and put within context of principal, peripheral working components such as a compatible gearbox layout...|$|R

5000|$|One {{issue with}} trijets is {{positioning}} the central engine. On most trijets this is {{placed at the}} tail along the centerline, producing some technical difficulties. The most common configuration is having the central engine located in the rear fuselage and supplied with air by an S-shaped duct [...] - [...] this is used on the Hawker Siddeley Trident, Boeing 727, Tupolev Tu-154, Lockheed Tristar and, more recently, the Dassault_Falcon_7X. The S-duct design {{has the advantage of}} reduced drag, additionally since the engine outlet is located lower down, the aircraft will be easier to handle {{in the event of an}} engine failure. However, S-ducts are complicated and costly designs. Furthermore, the central engine bay would require structural changes in order accommodate future larger-diameter engines in the case of the Boeing 727 and Lockheed TriStar. The Boeing 727's central bay was only wide enough to fit a low-bypass turbofan and not the newer high-bypass turbofans which had greater output as well as being quiet enough to meet new noise regulations of the 1980s, but such a redesign was prohibitively expensive and so Boeing ended production of the 727 instead of pursuing further development. The Lockheed Tristar's S-duct cross section was too small to fit an existing double <b>spool</b> <b>engine</b> as it was designed only to accommodate the new triple <b>spool</b> RB211 <b>engine,</b> and delays in RB211 development in turn pushed back the TriStar's entry into service which affected sales. [...] The DC-10 and related MD-11 use an alternative [...] "straight" [...] layout, which allows for easier engine installation, modification, and access. However, this has inferior aerodynamic properties when compared to the S-duct designs. Also, as the engine outlet is located much higher up than the wing-mounted engines, an engine failure will produce a greater moment about the aircraft's lateral axis, making it more difficult to control.|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} fault {{detection}} and isolation (FDI) has {{attracted much attention}} in control theory {{during the last three}} decades which has resulted in development of sophisticated FDI algorithms. However, increasing the complexity of FDI algorithms is not necessarily feasible. Particularly for on-line FDI, the FDI unit must have the minimum possible computation cost to prevent any long delays in fault detection. In this research, we try to address the FDI problem of a single <b>spool</b> jet <b>engine</b> by using a modified linear multiple model (MM). We first develop a novel symbolic computation-based method for linearization purposes such that the obtained linear models are subjected to the symbolic fault variables. By substituting certain values for these symbolic variables, one can obtain different linear models, which describe mathematically the healthy and faulty models. In order to select the operating point, we use this fact that for a given constant fuel flow (W_f), the system reaches a steady state, that is varying for different values of W_f. Therefore, the operating points for linearization can be determined by the level of the Power Level Angel (PLA) (different values of W_f). These operating points are selected such that an observer, which is designed as a candidate for the healthy mode, can accurately estimates the states of the system in healthy scenario and the number of false alarm then would be kept to minimum. If the system works at different operating points one can then discretize the W_f into different intervals such that in each interval a linear model represents the behavior of the original system. By using the obtained models for different operating points, one designs the corresponding FDI units. Second, we provide a modified multiple model (MM) approach to investigate the FDI problem of a single <b>spool</b> jet <b>engine.</b> The main advantage of this method {{lies in the fact that}} the proposed MM consists of a certain set of linear Kalman filter banks rather than using nonlinear Kalman filters such as the Extended Kalman Filter which requires more computational cost. Moreover, a hierarchical structural multiple model is used to detect and isolate multiple faults. The simulation results show the capability of the proposed method when it is applied to a single <b>spool</b> jet <b>engine</b> model. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is to develop and {{evaluate}} a cutback noise minimization process - also known as dynamic cutback optimization - that considers <b>engine</b> <b>spool</b> down during thrust cutback and is consistent with ICAO and FAR Part 36 noise certification procedures. Simplified methods for flyover EPNL prediction used by propulsion designers assume instantaneous thrust reduction and do {{not take into account}} the spooling down of the engine during the cutback procedure. The thesis investigates if there is an additional noise benefit that can be gained by modeling the <b>engine</b> <b>spool</b> down behavior. This in turn would improve the margin between predicted EPNL and Stage 4 noise regulations. Modeling dynamic cutback also impacts engine design during the preliminary and detailed design stages. Reduced noise levels due to cutback may be traded for lower engine fan diameter, which in turn reduces weight, fuel burn, and cost. M. S.

5000|$|The TriStar's design {{featured}} a twin-aisle interior {{with a maximum}} of 400 passengers and a three-engine layout. The TriStar was originally conceived as a [...] "jumbo twin", but a three-engine design was ultimately chosen to give the aircraft enough thrust to take off from existing runways. The main visible difference between the TriStar and its similar trijet competitor, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, is the central tail engine configuration: the DC-10's engine is mounted above the fuselage for simplicity of design and more economical construction, while the TriStar's engine is mounted to the rear fuselage and fed through an S-duct (similar to the Boeing 727) for reduced drag, improved stability, and easier servicing/replacement. Lockheed engineers were able to maintain straight-through engine performance by limiting {{the curve of the}} S-duct to {{less than a quarter of}} the radius of the engine intake diameter. The S-duct design also reduced the total empty aircraft weight. The research undertaken during the design of the L-1011 indicated that losses of using an S-duct were more than compensated for by the above savings. A further major difference between the L-1011 and the DC-10 was Lockheed's selection of the Rolls-Royce RB211 as the only engine for the L-1011. As originally designed, the RB211 turbofan was an advanced three-spool design with a carbon fiber fan, which would have better efficiency and power-to-weight ratio than any competing engine like the General Electric CF6 that powered the DC-10. In theory, the triple spool would produce the same or more power of existing double <b>spool</b> <b>engines</b> while having a smaller cross section that would reduce drag.|$|R

On the other hand, although use of an implicit integration algorithm can enlarge the step size, extra function evaluations are needed to calculate the system Jacobian for the Newton-Raphson algorithm, and the simulation still cannot reach real time.

The bleed air {{is to be used}} for flow control on the aerodynamic control surfaces of a tailless configur-ation such as the blended wing body aircraft. The engine simulation uses the inter-component volume method and runs in MATLAB/Simulink environment. Bleed effects were simulated both with and without the control of engine speed. Experimental data for the advanced micro turbine (AMT) Olympus single-spool turbojet engine was used to validate the simulation results. Under nominal bleed conditions, the results were accurate to within 5 per cent of experimental values. While for excessive engine bleeds the results were accurate to within 10 per cent. The effect of engine bleed location along the compressor length was also incorporated. A proportional + integral speed controller with slew rate limiting was implemented {{as an integral part of}} the model. The method presented here could be easily expanded for steady state and transient performance simulation of two and three <b>spool</b> turbojet/turbofan <b>engines...</b>|$|R
