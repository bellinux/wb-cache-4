5|$|During the ice ages of {{the last}} two million years the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas have been covered by the {{expanded}} polar ice cap several times. As the ice moved it eroded the rock, filling the river canyons with gravel. In some sections <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> have cut through the gravel and flow swiftly over bedrock, and in some areas large boulders have fallen into <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> and formed rapids.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rivers</b> Agency {{concluded}} that the flooding was an extreme event, caused by weather that resulted in widespread flooding across Northern Ireland. The amount of water in <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> exceeded {{the capacity of the}} flood defences and the natural river banks. They further {{concluded that}} the flooding was a result of overflow of the Shimna River into the Burren River catchment area through Islands Park, rather than from the Burren River itself.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rivers</b> {{played a}} leading role in the {{lifestyle}} of the Aboriginal people, acting as a source of food and a means of communication and trade. Murray cod and shellfish were gathered for food and bark canoes were used for travel along <b>the</b> <b>rivers.</b> Scars on many trees alongside <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> are evidence of this extensive use of canoes. In the summer it is likely that the Bangerang and Wiradjuri joined the Monaro groups in the Bogong moth feasts in the alpine country to the east.|$|E

5|$|Located in the Northern Rockies, Missoula has {{a typical}} Rocky Mountain ecology. Local {{wildlife}} includes populations of white-tailed deer, black bears, osprey, and bald eagles. During the winter, rapid snowmelt on Mount Jumbo {{due to its}} steep slope leaves grass available for grazing elk and mule deer. <b>The</b> <b>rivers</b> around Missoula provide nesting habitats for bank swallows, northern rough-winged swallows and belted kingfishers. Killdeer and spotted sandpipers can be seen foraging for insects along the gravel bars. Other species include song sparrows, catbirds, several species of warblers, and the pileated woodpecker. <b>The</b> <b>rivers</b> also provide cold, clean water for native fish such as westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. The meandering streams also attract beaver and wood ducks. The parks also host a variety of snakes such as racers, garter snakes, and rubber boa.|$|E
5|$|Mason devoted {{much effort}} during the American Revolutionary War to {{safeguarding}} Fairfax County and <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> of Virginia, since the British several times raided areas along the Potomac. Control of <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> and of Chesapeake Bay was urgent as Virginians tried to obtain hard currency by trading tobacco to the French and other European nations. The export of tobacco, generally via the West Indies, allowed Mason {{and others to}} obtain, via France and Holland, British-made items such as cloth, clothing patterns, medicines, and hardware.|$|E
50|$|The city {{is located}} on a hill from which many Donbass <b>rivers</b> originate. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> Bulavin (a {{tributary}} of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> Krynka, Mius basin) originates in the southern outskirts of <b>the</b> city, <b>the</b> <b>river</b> Lozova (a tributary of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> Lugan, Seversky Donets basin) in <b>the</b> north-east, <b>the</b> <b>river</b> Sanzharivka (a tributary of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> Lugan) in <b>the</b> north, <b>the</b> <b>river</b> Skelevaya (a tributary of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> Lugan) in <b>the</b> north-west, and <b>the</b> <b>river</b> Karapulka (a tributary of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> Lugan) in <b>the</b> western outskirts.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>river</b> {{is about}} 18 km long.

5|$|The town of Hull {{was founded}} {{late in the}} 12th century. The monks of Meaux Abbey needed a port where the wool from their estates could be exported. They chose {{a place at the}} {{confluence}} of <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> Hull and Humber to build a quay.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{ceramics}} on the Altiplano {{started in the}} Herrera Period, with the oldest evidences of ceramic use dated at 3000 BP. The many different clays of <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> and lakes of the valleys on the high plateau made a variety of ceramic types possible.|$|E
50|$|The lake is fed by 45000 km2 of {{catchment}} areas and its 21 major tributaries.

5|$|There follow {{confusing}} episodes involving Brittany (sometimes called Letia). Padarn finally {{leaves for}} France, where he dies, but his remains are brought back and buried in Vannes. A final chapter tells how Padarn, David and Teilo divide south Wales into three episcopates, with Padarn as bishop of Ceredigion. Then, convinced by a miracle performed by Padarn, a local governor called Eithir is persuaded to give land between <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> Rheidol and Paith to Padarn. The lands owned by Llanbadarn in {{the twelfth century}} were between <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> Rheidol and Clarach. The Paith is a minor tributary of the River Ystwyth. The obscure figure of Eithyr is commemorated in the farm name of Llaneithr, which stands a mile east of Devil's Bridge near the river Mynach.|$|E
5|$|There {{were four}} main phases in the {{construction}} of the fortress. The work on the first part, a fortified manor for Despot Đurađ Branković built at the confluence of <b>the</b> <b>rivers,</b> began in the autumn of 1428.|$|E
5|$|While the Roman colonia and {{fortress}} {{were located}} on high ground, by 400AD {{the town was}} victim to occasional flooding from <b>the</b> <b>Rivers</b> Ouse and Foss and the population reduced.

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Fort Donelson to Grant's army on February 16, the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, two major water routes in the Confederate west, became Union {{waterways}} for movement of troops and material. As Grant suspected, the Union capture of the two forts and <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> flanked the Confederate forces at Columbus, and soon caused them to withdraw from that city and from western Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|After the {{generally}} failed assaults on the bridges, the German divisions began crossing attempts over <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> IJssel and Maas. The first waves typically were destroyed, due to insufficient preparatory {{fire on the}} pillboxes. At most places a secondary bombardment destroyed the pillboxes and the infantry divisions crossed the river after building pontoon bridges; but at some, as Venlo, the attempt was aborted. At Arnhem, Leibstandarte Der Fuehrer led the assault and that day advanced to the Grebbe Line, followed by 207. Infanteriedivision.|$|E
