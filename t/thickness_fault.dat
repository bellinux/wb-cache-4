Earthquake faulting associated with frictional melting is controlled by factors such as strain rate, melt <b>thickness,</b> <b>fault</b> roughness, melt escape from the slip interface, and melt viscosity (Fialko and Khazan 2005; Nielsen et al. 2008).

Four dip angles are considered : (1) vertical; (2) 45 degrees; (3) 26. 7 degrees; and (4) horizontal. A low elasticity area is hypothesized as a fault zone. Sets of double couple forces are {{applied for a}} fault. Effects due to several variables (boundary condition, fault <b>thickness,</b> <b>fault</b> length and fault depth) are examined, and surface deformations are calculated. Boundary conditions affect the magnitude of surface deformation; depth, length and thickness of a fault affect not only the magnitude, but also the pattern of deformation. For two cases, displacement field and stress field are shown. Using comparisons of the above crustal deformations and field data in the Mikawa earthquake of 1945 (M= 7. 1), a best-fit model for fault parameters is obtained. The model is in fairly good agreement with that obtained by Ando's dislocation model...|$|E
40|$|A {{double-layered}} {{seismic zone}} is determined in Arica, northern Chile using locally recorded events.

The genesis of the Arica double seismic zone seems to be independent of the age, the relative convergence rate {{and direction of the}} Nazca plate, because all of these parameters are almost the same along the whole northern Chile and a clear separation of the seismicity into two layers is only observed around the Arice elbow. Moreover, it cannot be responsible for the double layered seismic zone because no similar significant changes are observed in the other well studied double seismic zones. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

A kinematic and mechanical model is developed for these specific grabens with the hope that this will aid in interpreting graben systems elsewhere on the earth and other planets. Because studies on other planets must be based entirely on photo analysis, an attempt is made to determine to what extent three-dimensional geometry could be inferred from photographs alone. An equation based on the model of graben geometry and kinematics relates <b>thickness</b> of <b>faulted</b> plates to graben parameters measurable on photographs.

40|$|Response {{analysis}} of the buried pipeline subjected to reverse fault displacement {{is very important for}} design, detection and protection of buried pipelines. This paper looks at the buckling behavior of a buried pipeline subjected to reverse fault displacement in the rock stratum. Effects of internal pressure, wall <b>thickness,</b> <b>fault</b> displacement and burial depth on the buckling mode and the axial strain of the buried pipeline are discussed. The results show that there are two buckling locations on the buried pipeline subjected to reverse fault displacement in the rock stratum and that the buckling modes of the buried pipes with different internal pressures are different. The two buckling locations are not symmetrically distributed along the fault plane. The buckling mode ranges from collapse to wrinkle as the internal pressure increases. The buckling phenomenon becomes more serious as the fault displacement increases, and the shape of the deformation curve changes from the S-shape to the Z-shape. The process of pipeline deformation can be divided into three stages. There is no buckling in the first stage. The second stage is a transition stage, buckling appears on the buried pipeline. Buckling is more serious in the third stage. Fault displacement has a small effect on the maximum strain position of the buried pipeline. The deformation curve of the buried pipeline is smoother as the wall thickness increases. The maximum axial strain of pressure pipes first increases and then decreases as the wall thickness increases...|$|E
40|$|The Mid-oceanic ridge {{system is}} a feature unique to Earth. It {{is one of the}} {{fundamental}} components of plate tectonics and reflects interior processes of mantle convection within the Earth. The thermal structure beneath the mid-ocean ridges {{has been the subject of}} several modeling studies. It is expected that the elastic thickness of the lithosphere is larger near the transform faults that bound mid-ocean ridge segments. Oceanic core complexes (OCCs), which are generally thought to result from long-lived fault slip and elastic flexure, have a shape that is sensitive to elastic thickness. By modeling the shape of OCCs emplaced along a ridge segment, it is possible to constraint elastic thickness and therefore the thermal structure of the plate and how it varies along-axis. This thesis builds upon previous studies that utilize thin plate flexure to reproduce the shape of OCCs. I compare OCC shape to a suite of models in which elastic <b>thickness,</b> <b>fault</b> dip, fault heave, crustal thickness, and axial infill are systematically varied. Using a grid search, I constrain the parameters that best reproduce the bathymetry and/or the slope of ten candidate OCCs identified along the 12 °— 15 °N segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The lithospheric elastic thicknesses that explains these OCCs is thinner than previous investigators suggested and the fault planes dip more shallowly in the subsurface, although at an angle compatible with Anderson’s theory of faulting. No relationships between model parameters and an oceanic core complexes location within a segment are identified with the exception that the OCCs located less than 20 km from a transform fault have slightly larger elastic thickness than OCCs in the middle of the ridge segment...|$|E

Mesoscopic structural observations of the drilled cores from Taiwan Chelungpu-fault Drilling Project Hole-A are reported in this article to describe and reveal the distribution of fault rocks within the Chelungpu Fault System. The Chelungpu Fault System in Hole-A was encountered {{at a depth of}} between 1050 - 1250 m where deformation structures increased. Three major fault zone structures were found at approximate depths of 1111, 1153, and 1221 m. The presence of wide fault rock regions were mostly concentrated in these 3 fault zones. The fault zone at 1111 m mainly consists of a nearly brecciated fracture zone and a clayey fault gouge zone of about 1. 05 m in <b>thickness.</b> <b>Fault</b> rocks from the fault zone at 1153 m are characterized by the presence of sand grains in the matrix content, consisting of a 1. 1 -m thick fault breccia zone and a 0. 35 -m thick fault gouge zone.

Each of the 3 fault zones contains a few layers of dark colored rocks of approximately 5 - 80 mm in thickness within the fault breccia and fault gouge zones.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the statistical characteristics of <b>fault</b> core <b>thickness</b> and <b>fault</b> displacement, and to state the relationship between these two fault attributes. Field work was carried out At Tidwell Draw, in the San Rafael region of Utah, USA; and along the Moab Fault adjacent to the entrance to Arches National Park. Data from these sites were statistically analyzed, and exceedence frequency plots of <b>fault</b> core <b>thickness</b> and <b>fault</b> throw were drawn. These exceedence frequency plots were then redrawn on several scales, and graphical analyses were conducted to determine the frequency distribution of <b>fault</b> core <b>thickness</b> and <b>fault</b> throw. Following that, the data was then plotted together on a bivariate scatter plot, and analyzed for linear correlation in graphs of different scales. The data from the Moab Fault site was augmented with data gathered from photographs. Analysis suggests that results of data gathered from photographs can produce similar results and can be an acceptable method to obtain data from difficult locations. Results of these analyses reveal that fault throw at these locations is distributed following a power law distribution pattern, and that <b>fault</b> <b>thickness</b> tends to follow a log-normal distribution. Analysis of a global data base involving data from selected previously published works reveal that for many data sets, exceedence frequency plots of displacement reveal that frequency distribution tends to follow log-normal trends, rather than power law trends. The similar results display log-normal distribution for <b>fault</b> <b>thickness</b> as well. Emphasis is placed on the importance of analyzing EF plot in all scales in order to form the most accurate interpretation of data distribution Bivariate analysis of fault displacement and <b>fault</b> core <b>thickness</b> for the global data set exhibited a power law relationship with an exponent of 0, 728 with a global goodness of fit regression of 74, 2 %. Although the data from Tidwell Draw displayed a regression of 52, 0 % for a power law relation with exponent value of 0, 683, the data plotted consistent with the global plot. The data from the Moab Fault site also plotted consistent with the global plot. Although the Moab Fault data showed a weak regression for the power law relationship with exponent equal to 0, 497, when the data was combined with another data set covering the upper ranges of the Moab Fault attributes, the combined Moab Fault data set showed a power law relationship with an exponent of 0, 715 with a goodness of fit regression of 88, 0 %, exceeding the regression of both of the Moab Fault data sets and the global data set. This result indicates that 1) A large data set covering a broader range of displacement and <b>fault</b> core <b>thickness</b> will produce better results, and 2) data sets having most in common will produce better results when combined than data having least in common.

40|$|Abstract—The {{staggered}} grid finite-difference {{method is}} a powerful tool in seismology and is commonly used to study earthquake source dynamics. In the staggered grid finite-difference method stress and particle velocity components are calculated at different grid points, and a faulting problem is a mixed boundary problem, therefore different implementations of fault boundary conditions have been proposed. VIRIUEX and MADARIAGA (1982) chose the shear stress grid as the fault surface, however, this method has several problems: (1) Fault slip leakage outside the fault, and (2) the stress bump beyond the crack tip caused by S waves is not well resolved. MADARIAGA et al. (1998) solved the latter problem via thick fault implementation, but the former problem remains and causes a new issue; displacement discontinuity across the slip is not well modeled because of the artificial thickness of the fault. In the present study we improve {{the implementation of the}} fault boundary conditions in the staggered grid finite-difference method by using a fictitious surface to satisfy the fault boundary conditions. In our implementation, velocity (or displacement) grids are set on the fault plane, stress grids are shifted half grid spacing from the fault and stress on the fictitious surface in the rupture zone is given such that the interpolated stress on the fault is equal to the frictional stress. Within the area which does not rupture, stress on the fictitious surface is given a condition of no discontinuity of the velocity (or displacement). Fault normal displacement (or velocity) is given such that the normal stress on the fault is continuous across the fault. Artificial viscous damping is introduced on the fault to avoid vibration caused by onset of the slip. Our implementation has five advantages over previous versions: (1) No leakage of the slip prior to rupture and (2) a zero <b>thickness</b> <b>fault,</b> (3) stress on the fault is reliably calculated, (4) our implementation is suitable for the study of fault constitutive laws, as slip is defined as the difference between displacement on the plane of z = + 0 and that of z =) 0, and (5) cessation of slip is achieved correctly.

40|$|The <b>thickness</b> of <b>fault</b> damage zones, a {{characteristic}} {{length of the}} cross-fault distribution of secondary fractures, significantly affects fault stress, earthquake rupture, ground motions and crustal fluid transport. Field observations indicate that damage zone thickness scales with accumulated fault displacement at short displacements, but saturates at few hundred meters for displacements larger than few kilometers. To explain this transition of scaling behavior, we conduct 3 D numerical simulations of dynamic rupture with off-fault inelastic deformation on long strike-slip faults. We find that the distribution of coseismic inelastic strain {{is controlled by the}} transition from crack-like to pulse-like rupture propagation associated with saturation of the seismogenic depth. The yielding zone reaches its maximum thickness when the rupture becomes a stable pulse-like rupture. Considering fracture mechanics theory, we show that seismogenic depth controls the upper bound of damage zone <b>thickness</b> on mature <b>faults</b> by limiting the efficiency of stress concentration near earthquake rupture fronts. We obtain a quantitative relation between limiting damage zone thickness, background stress, dynamic fault strength, off fault yield strength and seismogenic depth, which agrees with first-order field observations.

Although <b>fault</b> core <b>thickness</b> is a large uncertainty in calculations of transmissibility multipliers used to represent faults in single-phase reservoir flow models, few data exist on <b>fault</b> core <b>thickness</b> in deformation-band <b>fault</b> zones. To provide accurate estimates of deformation-band fault petrophysical properties, we measured <b>fault</b> core <b>thickness</b> at six sites (each 4 – 15 m [13 – 49 ft] along strike) along the Big Hole fault in the Navajo Sandstone, central Utah.

The Pelona Schist is predominantly a quartz-albite-muscovite-actinolite schist with associated minor metabasalts. The Punchbowl fault zone, which is exhumed 2 - 4 km, has 44 km of right lateral slip, and is composed of a fault core enveloped by a damaged zone. The fault core is a region of extreme slip localization that records most fault displacement. Deformation in the fault core is dominated by grain-size reduction accompanied by fluid-dominated alteration, {{in contrast to the}} damage zone, where deformation is dominated by brittle and semi-brittle fracturing, cataclasis, and slip. Portions of the Punchbowl fault have multiple fault cores, with each fault core less than 10 cm thick. The <b>thickness</b> of a <b>fault</b> depends upon the type of deformation measured and the scale of observation. Mesoscopic fractures begin 50 m from the fault core, whereas the onset of fault-related microfractures occurs at approximately 40 m from the fault core. A geochemical signature based on whole-rock geochemistry suggests a <b>fault</b> <b>thickness</b> of less than 10 m. Grain-size reduction occurs over a 10 m thick region and mineralogic changes occur over a region 20 - 30 m thick. Reorientation of preexisting foliation occurs over a zone 30 m thick. Fault-core morphology and textures are similar to those in the Punchbowl fault to the northwest, where it displaces sedimentary rocks, and the San Gabriel fault, which formed in crystalline rocks. This suggests that the processes that form foliated, finegrained, cataclasite-dominated fault cores of large displacement faults are similar for diverse lithologies. The composition of the fault core is variable along strike, with little geochemical or mineralogical homogenization. Whereas processes that form fault cores are similar, localized interaction of fluids caused compositional variability within the core. Changes in fault composition and fluid-rock interactions may result in different fault properties and behaviors...|$|R

However, once the applied plate displacement is 1 - 2 times the crustal thickness, partitioning of deformation between fault slip and off-fault distributed shear is 3 ̆e 0. 90, regardless of the basal boundary conditions. In addition, at any moment during the evolution of the analog fault system, the ratio of fault slip to off-fault deformation is larger than the cumulative ratio. We also find that the upward and lateral propagation of faults as an active shear zone developing early in the experiments has greater impact on the system’s strike-slip efficiency than later interaction between non-collinear fault segments. For bends with stepover distance of twice the crustal <b>thickness,</b> the <b>fault</b> slip to off-fault deformation ratio increases up to 0. 80 - 0. 90, after applied plate displacement exceeds twice the crustal thickness. Propagation of new oblique-slip faults around sharp restraining bends reduces the overall off-fault deformation within the fault system. In contrast, fault segments within gentle restraining bends continue to slip and the propagation of new oblique-slip faults have less effect on the system’s efficiency than for sharp restraining bends...|$|R
40|$|Coal seams in the Waikato Coal Measures {{can vary}} {{significantly}} in thickness over distances {{of hundreds of}} meters to kilometers. Previously, the primary depositional controls on these variations have been inferred to be syn-depositional normal faulting and pre-depositional paleotopography. The data presented in support of these models are typically equivocal and which, if any, of these processes provide the principal control on the geometry and spatial distribution of coal seams in the Waikato Coal Region is uncertain. This study utilizes a large database of drill-logs, seismic-reflection lines and mine exposures in four areas (Huntly, Maramarua, North HuntlylWaikare and Rotowaro Coalfields) to test whether syn-depositional faulting and/or paleotopography influence coal seam architecture. These data were used to construct cross sections across faults and basement topography, which in turn, offer information on the relative timing of faulting and coal measure deposition, together with information on the spatial relations between seam <b>thicknesses,</b> <b>faulting</b> and paleotopography. Cross sections and isopach maps together with examination of spatial and temporal variations in fault displacements reveal that syn-depositional normal faulting {{had little or no}} impact on the deposition of the Waikato Coal Measures. Only in the Maramarua study area was any evidence found of fault control on coal measure deposition, with the Landing Fault accruing displacement between deposition of the Kupalrupa Seam and the end of coal measure sedimentation. The vast majority of faults in the Waikato Coalfield were, however, active following coal measure deposition. For example, the Foote, Kimihia and Pukekapia faults show evidence of displacement accrual, which commenced during deposition of the Mangakotuku Formation (37 - 35 Ma BP). The duration of this episode of faulting is difficult to determine, but may have ceased about 30 Ma ago. In addition, a number of faults (e. g. Foote Fault) display evidence oflate stage extension during the last 5 Ma. Given the lack of stratigraphic evidence for fault displacements during deposition of coal measures, it is suggested that the Mangakotuku and Waipuna basement scarps are erosional rather than tectonic features. Cross sections, together with structure contour and isopach maps {{in each of the four}} study areas examined, indicate that basement topography was the dominant control on the spatially variable accumulation of peat. These data show coal seams both thinning into, and away from, topographic lows. To account for this observation a model is proposed, in which peat accumulation is controlled by basement relief and sediment supply to parts of the depositional system. In the model it is postulated that the Waikato Coal Measures depositional system was a continuum between two end members. In one end member, with a high sediment supply, sediment is channeled into the lowest topographic areas and peat accumulates mainly on topographic highs. In the other end member, with little or no sediment supply, peat accumulates to its greatest thickness in areas of relatively low topography, in addition to on basement ridges. In the Rotowaro and North Huntly/Waikare study areas, the thickest peat developed on basement highs and the lows acted as a conduit for sedimentation. On basement highs, peat mires were largely sheltered from clastic sediment influx. In the Huntly East and Maramarua study areas, the thickest peat accumulated in basement lows, with comparable clastic sedimentation in highs and lows. The proposed model has application to other coalfields where peat accumulated on an undulating topographic surface and sediment supply was channelised. Prediction of coal seam thickness, as well as lithological types, is crucial in coal exploration and development. The methodology developed and employed in this study can be applied to other basins to access and model coal and clastic sediment distribution...|$|R
40|$|AbstractContact of {{geometric}} asperities across rough faults causes perturbations to the shear traction resolved on a fault {{surface that}} could potentially deflect the local slip direction. Slickenlines, which record {{the relative displacement of}} opposing sides of a fault, may therefore be sensitive to fault surface geometry. To investigate the relationship between fault geometry, shear traction and slip, we use ground-based LiDAR to measure the orientations of slickenlines defined by centimeter-amplitude corrugations on three fault surfaces. Slickenline rakes measured in the mean plane of each fault rarely vary by more than a few degrees. Deviations from the mean rake do not correlate with the fault surface topography at scales up to a few meters, but a weak correlation may be present at larger scales. Slip directions are therefore insensitive to any shear traction perturbations from the contact of geometric asperities at small scales. This observation is consistent with scale-dependent deformation. We show that the roughness of fault surfaces implies that short wavelength asperities fail inelastically because of flattening during fault slip. A crossover to elastic deformation occurs at lengths of 10 − 2 to 100 m, which defines the minimum dimension of a strength asperity that influences the displacement field. The roughness at the crossover length scale corresponds to the typical <b>thickness</b> of <b>fault</b> rocks in the fault core suggesting that <b>fault</b> rock <b>thickness</b> is related to the crossover length scale. The data requires that multiple processes combine to produce the fault surface geometry. We reconcile the variety of processes with the consistent surface roughness scaling by noting that all of the processes are governed in different ways by the elastic limit of rock...|$|R
40|$|In {{regions with}} large, mature fault systems, a {{characteristic}} earthquake model {{may be more}} appropriate for modelling earthquake occurrence than extrapolating from a short history of small, instrumentally observed earthquakes using the Gutenberg–Richter scaling law. We illustrate how the geomorphology and geodesy of the Malawi Rift, a region with large seismogenic <b>thicknesses,</b> long <b>fault</b> scarps, and slow strain rates, {{can be used to}} assess hazard probability levels for large infrequent earthquakes. We estimate potential earthquake size using fault length and recurrence intervals from plate motion velocities and generate a synthetic catalogue of events. Since {{it is not possible to}} determine from the geomorphological information if a future rupture will be continuous (7. 4 ≤ M W ≤ 8. 3 with recurrence intervals of 1, 000 – 4, 300 years) or segmented (6. 7 ≤ M W ≤ 7. 7 with 300 – 1, 900 years), we consider both alternatives separately and also produce a mixed catalogue. We carry out a probabilistic seismic hazard assessment to produce regional- and site-specific hazard estimates. At all return periods and vibration periods, inclusion of fault-derived parameters increases the predicted spectral acceleration above the level predicted from the instrumental catalogue alone, with the most significant changes being in close proximity to the fault systems and the effect being more significant at longer vibration periods. Importantly, the results indicate that standard probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) methods using short instrumental records alone tend to underestimate the seismic hazard, especially for the most damaging, extreme magnitude events. For many developing countries in Africa and elsewhere, which are experiencing rapid economic growth and urbanisation, seismic hazard assessments incorporating characteristic earthquake models are critical...|$|R
30|$|Faults {{will form}} fault zones during {{displacement}} and dislocation processes. When a given fault zone {{is filled with}} shale, it can seal oil and gas laterally due to the plastic flow and compaction of shale. When a fault zone is filled with sandstone, it {{can act as a}} hydrocarbon migration pathway since sandstone compacts poorly and has good porosity and permeability. Accordingly, Fu et al. (2012) improved the fault gouge ratio (SGR) proposed by Yielding et al. (1997) and proposed to characterize the sealing property of faults using the ratio between the mudstone <b>thickness</b> of a <b>fault</b> belt and the sum of the fault throw and <b>faulted</b> formation <b>thicknesses,</b> namely the shale content of the fillings in a given fault belt. Due to the negative inversion of fault F 1, Cretaceous shale smeared the fault surface repeatedly. Therefore, the shale in the Cretaceous fault zone fillings was formed in compressional and extensional stages. Hence, the faults that formed in compressional and extensional stages were obtained from structural section restoration.|$|R
