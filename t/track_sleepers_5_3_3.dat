50|$|At present, {{the group}} have {{completed}} ballast laying {{over the first}} mile from the junction with the GCR to Wood Lane.

In June, the group received a £5000 donation from the Great Central's support charity, bringing them closer to their goal to complete the track laying. An ex-British Railways AC Cars railbus, which has been stored at the back of Loughborough since 2006, is also planned to be restored for use on the branch and the rest of the railway in general, with work due to start as soon as enough money has been raised.

50|$|As was {{the case}} with many of Queensland’s railways, freight traffic {{steadily}} declined {{to the point that the}} Winton Branch became uneconomical to maintain.
