5000|$|In {{technical}} terms, {{the pattern}} of scores by individual students to individual items is used to infer so-called scale locations of students, the [...] "measurements". This process is one form of scaling. Essentially, higher <b>total</b> <b>scores</b> give higher scale locations, consistent with the traditional and everyday use of <b>total</b> <b>scores.</b> If certain theory is used, though, {{there is not a}} strict correspondence between the ordering of <b>total</b> <b>scores</b> and the ordering of scale locations. The Rasch model provides a strict correspondence provided all students attempt the same test items, or their performances are marked using the same marking rubrics.|$|R
5|$|A team {{typically}} {{consists of}} nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity.

Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally {{it is to the}} students' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can.

40|$|Background: Sensitive {{cognitive}} global {{scores are}} beneficial in screening and monitoring for prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early cortical changes provide a novel opportunity for validating established cognitive <b>total</b> <b>scores</b> against the biological disease markers. Methods: We examined how two different <b>total</b> <b>scores</b> of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) battery and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) {{are associated with}} cortical thickness (CTH) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and prodromal AD. Cognitive and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 22 progressive MCI, 78 stable MCI, and 98 control subjects, and MRI data of 103 AD patients of the prospective multicenter study were analyzed. Results: CERAD <b>total</b> <b>scores</b> correlated with mean CTH more strongly (r = 0. 34 - 0. 38, p Conclusion: CERAD <b>total</b> <b>scores</b> {{are sensitive to the}} CTH signature of prodromal AD, which supports their biological validity in detecting early disease-related cognitive changes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} method to rank {{multiple}} efficient candidates, which often happens in DEA method, by comparing the least relative <b>total</b> <b>scores</b> for each efficient candidate with {{the best and the}} least relative <b>total</b> <b>scores</b> measured in the same range.

The game would go on to sell 342,779 copies in the region by the end of 2005, becoming the 30th best-selling software title of that year, with a total of 397,000 copies sold worldwide by December 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{examination}} {{consists of}} six problems. Each problem is worth seven points, so the maximum <b>total</b> <b>score</b> is 42 points. No calculators are allowed. The examination is held over two consecutive days; each day the contestants have four-and-a-half hours to solve three problems. The problems chosen are from various areas {{of secondary school}} mathematics, broadly classifiable as geometry, number theory, algebra, and combinatorics. They require no knowledge of higher mathematics such as calculus and analysis, and solutions are often short and elementary. However, they are usually disguised {{so as to make}} the solutions difficult. Prominently featured are algebraic inequalities, complex numbers, and construction-oriented geometrical problems, though in recent years the latter has not been as popular as before.|$|E

5|$|Bonuses can {{be earned}} by {{achieving}} specific goals. If stunts or actions are repeated within a time limit, a score multiplier is earned and repeated actions boost the player's score further. Gameplay {{takes place in}} a single tropical jungle area, {{at the beginning of a}} game the jeep appears in a random location within the jungle. Stunt ramps are set up throughout the game area, along with the hills and valleys these facilitate long-distance jumps and other stunts. Each game takes four minutes, after the timer counts down to zero, the <b>total</b> <b>score</b> and any bonuses earned are shown. The player's ranking compared to other games played that day and the all-time highscores are also shown. Specific achievements can be gained by players, which are saved to their online profile, though the game can be played as a 'guest', which doesn't require a game profile to be created.|$|E
5|$|During single-player segments, {{the player}} could select two AI companions after {{selecting}} missions, which {{added to the}} player's <b>total</b> <b>score</b> {{at the end of}} these missions. During missions, the companions could be issued with Team Commands, which could either order them to attack or increase healing abilities while lowering their defensive capabilities. Each attempt at a mission used up the Cadet's stamina meter, which allowed a maximum of three missions at a time. The game used a job system similar to other entries in the Final Fantasy series, where different equipment and weapons alter a character's abilities in battle. Specific skills accompanied each job. Players could create multiple equipment sets, with each item and weapon ranked according to its rarity in-game. Materials gathered during missions could be used to upgrade the player's equipment and abilities.|$|E
5|$|Halo 3s {{story or}} {{campaign}} mode {{can be played}} through alone or cooperatively with up to three other players via Xbox Live or System Link. Instead of having each player be an identical character as in previous Halo games, the first player plays as Master Chief, and the second player plays as the Arbiter. The other two players control two Covenant Elites, N'tho 'Sraom and Usze 'Taham, each with their own backstories. No matter which character is played, each player has identical abilities, though their starting weapons vary. Hidden skulls found on each level cause changes to the gameplay when enabled, such as giving the enemies extra health, changing in-game dialogue, or modifying AI behavior. These skulls, {{as well as the}} difficulty level and the speed at which the level is completed, provide multipliers to the <b>total</b> <b>score.</b> Players are awarded gamerscore points for unlocking Achievements by reaching a certain score in each level.|$|E

He ended the season with a 4–3 record and a secure position as the coach for the next year.|$|E
5|$|Goat Simulator is an {{open-ended}} third-person perspective {{game in which}} the player controls a goat. The player is free to explore the game's world, a suburban setting, as a goat, and jump, run, bash things, and lick objects. Licking objects attaches the goat's tongue to the object and lets the player drag the object around until they let go. At any time, the player can let the goat drop into a ragdoll model, allowing the game's physics to take over, and another control makes the game run in slow-motion. A number of environmental features allow the player to manipulate the goat into stunts such as bouncing off trampolines or launching the goat into the air through large fans. The game features a scoring system similar to skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, whereby doing tricks or other actions earns points, while chaining such tricks together in sequence helps build a multiplier that applies to the <b>total</b> <b>score</b> of the tricks done in the sequence. Various in-game goals, such as achieving a certain height, completing flips, or destroying certain objects, are given to the player, but the player {{is not required to}} follow these instructions.|$|E
5|$|Liechtenstein won {{its first}} Olympic medals: two bronzes by Willi Frommelt and Hanni Wenzel in the alpine skiing slalom events. East German athletes {{achieved}} gold medal sweeps in luge and bobsleigh, {{which accounted for}} five of the country's seven Olympic titles. Alpine skier Rosi Mittermaier won the women's downhill and slalom events to give West Germany's two gold medals in these Games. She came close to winning a third in the giant slalom, which would have made her {{the first woman to}} win all three Olympic alpine skiing events. Cross-country skier Helena Takalo contributed three of Finland's seven medals by reaching podium place finishes in all of the women's events. Two Dutch speed skaters were responsible for five of their country's six medals: Piet Kleine won the men's 10,000 metres and came second in the 5,000 metres, while Hans van Helden secured bronze medals in the same events and also in the 1,500 metres. Before these Games, Great Britain's last Winter Olympic medal had been a gold at the 1964 Games, also held in Innsbruck. Twelve years later in the same city, the British team won again a single gold medal, this time by figure skater John Curry in the men's singles with a still-standing record <b>total</b> <b>score.</b> The two bronze medals won by Swedish athletes were not enough to prevent this team's performance from becoming the weakest ever in the nation's Winter Olympic history.|$|E
