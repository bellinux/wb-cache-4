5|$|There {{are several}} {{informal}} rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> this etiquette is that opposing enforcers {{must agree to}} a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.|$|E
5|$|Harvey Greenberg {{presents}} a Freudian reading in his The Movies on Your Mind, {{in which the}} transgressions which prevent Rick from returning to the United States constitute an Oedipus complex, which is resolved only when Rick begins {{to identify with the}} father figure of Laszlo and the cause which he represents. Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and that <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.|$|E
5|$|While Bobby Dodd was a {{determined}} competitor, he cared deeply {{for those who}} played for him.

Wilson became a leading theorist who embraced the doctrine that strategic bombing was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> air power. He argued that by attacking vulnerabilities, whole industries could be brought to a halt without necessarily having to destroy all of the factories. The doctrine which Wilson expounded later {{became the basis for}} AWPD-1, the Army Air Forces' strategic war plan developed in 1941.|$|E

25|$|When and how {{applications}} are taught varies from style to style.

These drills are often semi-compliant, meaning one student does not offer active resistance to a technique, {{in order to allow}} its demonstrative, clean execution. In more resisting drills, fewer rules apply, and students practice how to react and respond.

Upon the death of Menachem Nachum Twersky of Chernobyl, his son Mordechai Twersky succeeded him. The principle was conclusively affirmed in the great dispute after Liadi's demise in 1813: his senior acolyte Aharon HaLevi of Strashelye was defeated by his son, Dovber Schneuri, whose offspring retained the title for 181 years.|$|E
25|$|The solute {{content of}} water is perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> water conditions, as total {{dissolved}} solids and other constituents dramatically impact basic water chemistry, and therefore how organisms interact with their environment.

An aquarium may have freshwater (salinity below 500parts per million), simulating a lake or river environment; brackish water (a salt level of 500 to 30,000PPM), simulating environments lying between fresh and salt, such as estuaries; and salt water or seawater (a salt level of 30,000 to 40,000PPM), simulating an ocean environment. Rarely, higher salt concentrations are maintained in specialized tanks for raising brine organisms.|$|E
