5|$|Electronegativity is a {{chemical}} property {{that describes the}} tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. If the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent, the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to <b>the</b> <b>chlorine</b> because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted so close to <b>the</b> <b>chlorine</b> atom that they are practically transferred to <b>the</b> <b>chlorine</b> atom (an ionic bond). However, if the sodium atom {{was replaced by a}} lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to <b>the</b> <b>chlorine</b> atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned previously, francium is expected to be an exception.|$|E
5|$|In particular, {{substitution}} of two chlorine atoms {{for the two}} hydrogens at ring positions 4 and 5 yielded the first air-stable carbene. Its extra stability probably results from the electron-withdrawing effect of <b>the</b> <b>chlorine</b> substituents, which reduce the electron density on the carbon atom bearing the lone pair, via induction through the sigma-backbone.|$|E

40|$|With high {{content of}} the Al- 13 species and the active chloride, an {{electrochemically}} prepared polyaluminum chloride (E-PACI) presents integrated efficiency of coagulation and oxidation. The coagulation properties of E-PACI were systemically investigated through jar tests in the various water quality conditions. <b>The</b> active <b>chlorine</b> in E-PACI can significantly influence the coagulation behavior due to <b>the</b> active <b>chlorine</b> preoxidation, which can change the surface charge characteristic of organic matter (OM) in water. <b>The</b> active <b>chlorine</b> preoxidation could improve the E-PACI coagulation efficiency if the water possessed the characteristics of relatively low OM content (2 mg/L) and high hardness (278 mg CaCO 3 /L). In the water with medium content of OM (5 mg/L), dosage would be a crucial factor to decide whether <b>the</b> active <b>chlorine</b> in E-PACI aided coagulation process or not.

5|$|Chloralkali process: The largest {{industrial}} use of mercury during the 20th century was in electrolysis for separating chlorine and sodium from brine; mercury being the anode of the Castner-Kellner process. <b>The</b> <b>chlorine</b> {{was used for}} bleaching paper (hence the location {{of many of these}} plants near paper mills) while the sodium was used to make sodium hydroxide for soaps and other cleaning products.

5|$|Chlorine {{is usually}} used (in {{the form of}} hypochlorous acid) to kill {{bacteria}} and other microbes in drinking water supplies and public swimming pools. In most private swimming pools, chlorine itself is not used, but rather sodium hypochlorite, formed from chlorine and sodium hydroxide, or solid tablets of chlorinated isocyanurates. The drawback of using chlorine in swimming pools is that <b>the</b> <b>chlorine</b> reacts with the proteins in human hair and skin (see Hypochlorous acid), and becomes chemically bonded. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated.|$|E

5|$|Dichlorine heptoxide (Cl2O7) is the {{anhydride}} of {{perchloric acid}} (HClO4) and can readily {{be obtained from}} it by dehydrating it with phosphoric acid at −10°C and then distilling the product at −35°C and 1mmHg. It is a shock-sensitive, colourless oily liquid. It is the least reactive of <b>the</b> <b>chlorine</b> oxides, being {{the only one to}} not set organic materials on fire at room temperature. It may be dissolved in water to regenerate perchloric acid or in aqueous alkalis to regenerate perchlorates. However, it thermally decomposes explosively by breaking one of the central Cl–O bonds, producing the radicals ClO3 and ClO4 which immediately decompose to the elements through intermediate oxides.|$|E
5|$|In {{diaphragm}} cell electrolysis, an asbestos (or polymer-fiber) diaphragm separates a cathode and an anode, preventing <b>the</b> <b>chlorine</b> forming at the anode from re-mixing {{with the}} sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode. The salt solution (brine) is continuously fed to the anode compartment and {{flows through the}} diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the caustic alkali is produced and the brine is partially depleted. Diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali, {{but they are not}} burdened with the problem of mercury disposal and they are more energy efficient.|$|E
5|$|Samarium forms a cyclopentadienide Sm(C5H5)3 and its chloroderivatives Sm(C5H5)2Cl and Sm(C5H5)Cl2. They are {{prepared}} by reacting samarium trichloride with NaC5H5 in tetrahydrofuran. Contrary to cyclopentadienides {{of most other}} lanthanides, in Sm(C5H5)3 some C5H5 rings bridge each other by forming ring vertexes η1 or edges η2 toward another neighboring samarium atom, thereby creating polymeric chains. The chloroderivative Sm(C5H5)2Cl has a dimer structure, which is more accurately expressed as (η5-C5H5)2Sm(µ-Cl)2(η5-C5H5)2. There, <b>the</b> <b>chlorine</b> bridges can be replaced, for instance, by iodine, hydrogen or nitrogen atoms or by CN groups.|$|E

In the other hand, “C s(s, t)” must be less or equal to the upper limit of <b>the</b> acceptable-free <b>chlorine</b> interval (ε max =  0.4  mg/l). Thus, it is chosen to study the effect of three “C s(s, t)” values: 0.30, 0.35, and 0.40  mg/l on the number and locations of chlorination stations. The optimal chlorination scheduling should be identified in the short-term optimization step for each booster station design. To impose <b>the</b> target-free <b>chlorine</b> concentration “C s(s, t)” in the designed booster station exits, SPB station type is used in this step, with single scheduling period of 24  h cycle.

50|$|To {{treat the}} raw water, the bureau uses {{a process called}} chloramination, which disinfects <b>the</b> water with <b>chlorine</b> then adds ammonia to prolong <b>the</b> <b>chlorine's</b> effectiveness. Although these {{additives}} kill microorganisms such as coloform bacteria and giardia that can cause disease in humans, they can react with naturally occurring compounds in water to form other compounds such as trihalomethanes.

50|$|This {{reaction}} mechanism {{is supported by}} the observation that addition of pyridine to the reaction leads to inversion.

5|$|The main {{sources of}} bromine are in the United States and Israel. The element is liberated by halogen exchange, using {{chlorine}} gas to oxidise Br− to Br2. This is then removed with a blast of steam or air, and is then condensed and purified. Today, bromine is transported in large-capacity metal drums or lead-lined tanks that can hold hundreds of kilograms or even tonnes of bromine. The bromine industry is about one-hundredth the size of <b>the</b> <b>chlorine</b> industry. Laboratory production is unnecessary because bromine is commercially available and has a long shelf life.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{cannot be}} readily {{produced}} {{by reduction of}} its dioxide, titanium metal is obtained by reduction of TiCl4 with magnesium metal in the Kroll process. The complexity of this batch production in the Kroll process explains the relatively high market value of titanium, despite the Kroll process being less expensive than the Hunter process. To produce the TiCl4 required by the Kroll process, the dioxide is subjected to carbothermic reduction {{in the presence of}} chlorine. In this process, <b>the</b> <b>chlorine</b> gas is passed over a red-hot mixture of rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon. After extensive purification by fractional distillation, the TiCl4 is reduced with 800°C molten magnesium in an argon atmosphere. Titanium metal can be further purified by the van Arkel–de Boer process, which involves thermal decomposition of titanium tetraiodide.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{produced}} from sodium chloride (common salt, NaCl) using electrolysis {{to separate the}} metallic sodium from <b>the</b> <b>chlorine</b> gas. Usually the salt is dissolved in water to produce a brine. By-products of any such chloralkali process are hydrogen (H2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which is commonly called caustic soda or lye. By far the largest use of mercury in the late 20th century was in the mercury cell process (also called the Castner-Kellner process) where metallic sodium is formed as an amalgam at a cathode made from mercury; this sodium is then reacted with water to produce sodium hydroxide. Many of the industrial mercury releases of the 20th century came from this process, although modern plants claimed to be safe in this regard. After about 1985, all new chloralkali production facilities that {{were built in the}} United States used membrane cell or diaphragm cell technologies to produce chlorine.|$|E

Lipsett is credited with issuing the first order to counteract the effects of poison gas, when he ordered his men to urinate on strips of cloth and tie them to their faces to neutralise <b>the</b> <b>chlorine.</b> Lipsett's battalion was instrumental in holding the line during the action and he was consequently rewarded by being made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, promoted to acting brigadier-general and given command of the Canadian 2nd Brigade, which he trained during the spring of 1916 to conduct major trench raids on German lines.|$|E
5|$|Poisonous {{bromomethane}} {{was widely}} used as pesticide to fumigate soil and to fumigate housing, by the tenting method. Ethylene bromide was similarly used. These volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as ozone depletion agents. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer scheduled the phase {{out for the}} ozone depleting chemical by 2005, and organobromide pesticides are no longer used (in housing fumigation they {{have been replaced by}} such compounds as sulfuryl fluoride, which contain neither <b>the</b> <b>chlorine</b> or bromine organics which harm ozone). Before the Montreal protocol in 1991 (for example) an estimated 35,000 tonnes of the chemical were used to control nematodes, fungi, weeds and other soil-borne diseases.|$|E
5|$|Shelters {{closed by}} September1 and {{residents}} {{returned to their}} homes, although Hatteras Island remained off-limits to everyone but emergency workers for several days. Unemployment across Hatteras rose {{in the wake of}} the damage to local businesses, and many restaurants lost product when their refrigerators failed during the power outages. Residents piled debris from their damaged homes on roads, primarily Highway 12, and workers responded by clearing the debris. The highway was speedily reopened and repaired at a cost of around $1million. Within two weeks of the storm, businesses resumed as cleaning work was under way, and the island was reopened to tourists. Clean-up operations in the region lasted weeks to months. In the three months after the storm, saltwater intrusion into the Cape Hatteras water supply boosted chlorine levels from 40milligrams (0.0014ounces) to 280milligrams (0.01ounces) per liter; it took another three months for <b>the</b> <b>chlorine</b> to decrease to normal concentrations.

40|$|In {{a nuclear}} reactor, 35 Cl present as an {{impurity}} {{in the nuclear}} fuel is activated by thermal neutron capture. During interim storage or geological disposal of the nuclear fuel, 36 Cl may be released from the fuel to the geo/biosphere and contribute significantly to the ‘instant release fraction'. In order to elucidate the diffusion mechanisms, both irradiation and thermal effects must be assessed. This paper deals with the thermal diffusion of chlorine in depleted UO 2. For this purpose, sintered UO 2 pellets were implanted with 37 Cl at an ion fluence of 1013 cm− 2 and successively annealed in the 1175 – 1475 K temperature range. <b>The</b> implanted <b>chlorine</b> is used to simulate the behaviour of the displaced one due to recoil and to interactions with the fission fragments during reactor operation. The behaviour of the pristine and <b>the</b> implanted <b>chlorine</b> was investigated during thermal annealing. SIMS and μ-XAS (at the Cl–K edge) analyses show that: (1) the thermal migration of implanted chlorine becomes significant at 1275 K; this temperature and the calculated activation energy of 4. 3 eV points out the great ability of chlorine to migrate in UO 2 at relatively low temperatures, (2) the behaviour of <b>the</b> implanted <b>chlorine</b> which aggregates into ‘hot spots' during annealing before its effusion is clearly {{different from that of}} the pristine one which remains homogenously distributed after annealing, (3) the ‘hot spot' and <b>the</b> pristine <b>chlorine</b> seem to be in different structural environments.

25|$|In the reaction, {{sodium metal}} goes from an {{oxidation}} state of 0 (as it {{is a pure}} element) to +1: in other words, the sodium lost one electron and {{is said to have}} been oxidized.
