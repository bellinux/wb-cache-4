The cloud services are based on Internet i. e. <b>TCP</b> <b>IP.</b> The paper discusses limitations {{of one of the}} main existing network management protocol i. e. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) with respect to the current network conditions. The network traffic is growing at a high speed. When we talk about the networked environment of cloud, the monitoring tool should be capable of handling the traffic tribulations efficiently and represent a correct scenario of the network condition. The proposed Model Cloud Network Management Model provides a comprehensive solution to manage the growing traffic in cloud and trying to improve communication of manager and agents as in SNMP (the traditional <b>TCP</b> <b>IP</b> network management protocol). Firstly CNMM concentrates on reduction of packet exchange between manager and agent. Secondly it eliminates the counter problems exist in SNMP by having periodic updates from agent without querying by the manager. For better management we are including managers using virtualized technology. CNMM is a proposed model with efficient communication, secure packet delivery and reduced traffic. Though the proposed model supposed to manage the cloud traffic in a better and efficient way, the model is still a theoretical study, its implementation and results are yet to discover. The model however is the first step towards development of supported algorithms and protocol. Our further study will concentrate on development of supported algorithms.

40|$|Abstract — It is {{well-known}} that the bufferless nature of OBS networks causes random burst loss even at low traffic loads. When TCP is used over OBS, these random losses make the TCP sender decrease its congestion window {{even though the}} network may not be congested. This results in significant TCP throughput degradation. In this paper, we propose a coordinated multi-layer loss-recovery approach for TCP over OBS networks using Snoop and ARQ. We developed an analytical model for end-to-end TCP throughput using the hybrid approach over OBS and verified the results using simulations. We evaluate the performance of independent and coordinated Snoop and ARQ over an OBS network. Based on the numerical results, the proposed coordinated multi-layer Snoop and ARQ approach outperforms all other approaches at all traffic loads. 1 Keywords: <b>TCP,</b> <b>IP,</b> ARQ, Snoop, and OBS.

The overall objective was to independently and comparatively study ECN {{in a wide range of}} situations to better understand its advantages and disadvantages.
