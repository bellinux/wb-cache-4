5|$|The {{existence}} of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, in Brno (Czech Republic), he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2ncombinations where n {{is the number}} of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured Wilhelm Johannsen's distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> between dominant and recessive traits, <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.|$|E

5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes.

In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E

The main portion of the article is dedicated to the critique of Rorty’s private-public distinction, divided into two thematic sections: (i) <b>the</b> private-public <b>distinction</b> as undesirable and (ii) <b>the</b> private-public <b>distinction</b> as unattainable. I argue that Rorty’s formulation provides plausible answers to the first kind of criticism, but not to the second. Finally, a reformulation of <b>the</b> private-public <b>distinction</b> will be suggested, which both mitigates the second line of criticism and better coheres with Rorty’s general theory...|$|R
