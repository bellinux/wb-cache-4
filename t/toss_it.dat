25|$|After the Dhuni fire is lit and prayers, bhajans, and devotional {{songs are}} sung, people line {{up and take}} a piece of {{sandalwood}}. In turn they dip the sandalwood stick into ghee (clarified butter) and <b>toss</b> <b>it</b> into the fire, intending the offering to represent the relinquishing of some attachment or psychological limitation that they wish to be consumed by the fire. The ritual thus symbolizes surrendering and giving up desires and limitations to God.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{later said}} [...] "Jim Wong [...] {{was a big}} help, too. A lot of the stage {{directions}} point toward farce, but Jim told me to play against that and just let the situation play out. The Forrest Gump scene was difficult, too. When I prepared it and did it the first time, I was almost Shakespearean in my approach. Jim made me <b>toss</b> <b>it</b> off more, and it worked fine". Chris Owens who portrayed the Young Smoking Man spent time watching how Davis smokes to ensure {{that he did it}} just like him. Owens later appeared as a young version of The Smoking Man again in the episode [...] "Demons", and as his son Jeffrey Spender.|$|E
500|$|As {{opposed to}} earlier {{games in the}} Call of Duty series, the game {{features}} modern equipment and new features, many exclusive to the multiplayer part of the game, such as [...] "killstreaks"; killing a number of enemies without the player dying in between kills allows access to various assets including airstrikes and helicopter support. A character can be positioned {{in one of three}} stances: standing, crouching, or prone, each affecting the character's rate of movement, accuracy, and stealth. Using cover helps the player avoid enemy fire or recover health after taking significant damage. As such, there are no armor or health power ups. When the character has taken damage, the edges of the screen glow red and the character's heartbeat increases. If the character stays out of fire, the character can recover. When the character is within the blast radius of a live grenade, a marker indicates the direction of the grenade, helping the player to either flee or <b>toss</b> <b>it</b> back to the enemy.|$|E

6000|$|Norah's {{self-control}} {{began to}} show signs of failing her. Her dark cheeks glowed, her delicate lips trembled, before she spoke again. Magdalen paid more attention to her parasol than to her sister. She <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> high in the air and caught it. [...] "Once!" [...] she said--and <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> up again. [...] "Twice!"--and she <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> higher. [...] "Thrice--" [...] Before she could catch it for the third time, Norah seized her passionately by the arm, and the parasol dropped to the ground between them.|$|R

2500|$|Half an {{hour before}} the start of play, the two captains convene and {{exchange}} team selection sheets. These list the composition of each side, which cannot be changed {{for the duration of the}} match. Then, with the supervision of the umpires, a coin is tossed to determine who bats first. The umpire's call of play [...] marks the official beginning of the match. If the match is abandoned at any time after the <b>toss,</b> <b>it</b> stands as a match played and enters official statistical records. If a match is abandoned before the <b>toss,</b> <b>it</b> is not considered to have been played at all, and does not count for records.|$|E
2500|$|England’s {{chances of}} success in this match were {{perceived}} to be low, but they were immediately boosted by Rahul Dravid’s curious decision to ask England to bat on winning the <b>toss.</b> <b>It</b> was believed that this decision {{was based on the}} perceived weakness of England’s spin attack, who {{would not be able to}} exploit conditions on the final day of the match.|$|E
2500|$|Many stages have actual railing {{built on}} {{or around the}} stage to {{function}} as the tip railing, in addition to indicating where customers should position themselves relative to the performance zone. [...] Customers take turns tipping the dancer. [...] They may also line up to tip popular performers. [...] If physical railing is not present, the tip rail is the edge of stage or defined performance area. [...] Other common tip methods are to insert the dollar into the stripper's cleavage from the hand or mouth, to simply place it or <b>toss</b> <b>it</b> on stage, or to crumple bills into a ball shape and throw them in the entertainer's direction. Each club and dancer has different tolerance levels for customer interaction, including tipping. [...] Some clubs have multiple stages on the premises. [...] Tipping etiquette varies between countries and cultures. In Eastern European and Asian clubs it is customary to agree on payment upfront for {{a certain amount of}} time or dances, for stage performances and any private sessions.|$|E

2500|$|Clyde Engle, pinch-hitting for Wood, led {{off with}} an easy fly ball to Fred Snodgrass in center field. [...] Snodgrass dropped the ball, and Engle reached second base. [...] The next day's New York Times {{described}} the play as follows: [...] "And now the ball settles. It is full and fair in the pouch of the padded glove of Snodgrass. But he is too eager to <b>toss</b> <b>it</b> to Murray and it dribbles to the ground." [...] Hooper flied out to deep center—Snodgrass making a fine running catch right after his error—but Engle advanced to third. [...] Yerkes was then inexplicably walked by control expert Mathewson, putting the winning run on base. [...] Tris Speaker, who hit an even [...]300 in the 1912 World Series, lifted a foul popup [...] on the first base side, but first baseman Merkle, [...] pitcher Mathewson, and catcher Meyers allowed the ball to fall untouched in foul territory. Snodgrass later claimed that the Red Sox bench jockeys had disrupted the players' timing. Strangely, Mathewson called for catcher Meyers to take it even though Merkle was closer. [...] Meyers couldn't reach it and it fell to the ground. [...] Speaker then shouted, [...] "Well, you just called for the wrong man and it's gonna cost you the ball game!" [...] Given new life, he singled home Engle {{to tie the game}} 2–2, Yerkes advancing to third. [...] Mathewson walked Lewis intentionally, loading the bases and setting up a force at every base, but the next hitter, Larry Gardner, flied to Devore in right field deep enough for Yerkes to tag up and score, and the Red Sox won the 1912 World Series.|$|E
