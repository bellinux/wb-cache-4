50|$|As {{an example}} of {{stochastic}} resonance, consider the following demonstration after Simonotto et al.The image to the left shows an original picture of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. If this image is passed through a nonlinear threshold filter in which each pixel detects light intensity as above or below a given threshold, {{a representation of the}} image is obtained as in the images to the right. It can be hard to discern the objects in the filtered image in the top left because of the reduced amount of information present. The addition of noise before the <b>threshold</b> <b>operation</b> can result in a more recognizable output. The image below shows four versions of the image after the <b>threshold</b> <b>operation</b> with different levels of noise variance; the image in the top right hand corner appears to have the optimal level of noise allowing the Arc to be recognized, but other noise variances reveal different features.|$|E
50|$|The {{quality of}} the image {{resulting}} from stochastic resonance can be improved further by blurring, or subjecting the image to low-pass spatial filtering. This can be approximated in the visual system by squinting one's eyes or {{moving away from the}} image. This allows the observer's visual system to average the pixel intensities over areas, which is in effect a low-pass filter. The resonance breaks up the harmonic distortion due to the <b>threshold</b> <b>operation</b> by spreading the distortion across the spectrum, and the low-pass filter eliminates much of the noise that has been pushed into higher spatial frequencies.|$|E

30|$|<b>Threshold</b> <b>operations</b> {{were then}} {{applied to the}} {{distance}} transform image. After the distance transform image was obtained (shown in Figure  6 e), another binary image can be generated by the <b>threshold</b> <b>operations.</b> The pixels having intensity value equal or lower than the threshold were changed to 0. Therefore, {{the area of the}} cells in the binary image generated by the <b>threshold</b> <b>operations</b> (shown in Figure  6 f) was smaller than the area of the cells in the distance transform image (shown in Figure  6 e). These smaller foreground regions represent the markers of the cells as shown in Figure  6 f. Moreover, after the binary image was generated by the <b>threshold</b> <b>operations,</b> markers can be generated from the different blobs in the binary image. After obtaining the markers of the cells and the background as well as the gradient image of the cells as shown in Figure  6 f, the watershed transformation [27] was used, and the markers were colored with different gray levels, i.e. white color for background, lighter gray color for the upper cell, and darker gray color for the bottom cell. In the watershed transformation, the lighter gray maker spreads over all pixels of the upper cell while the darker gray marker spreads over all pixels of the bottom cell. When different markers merged together, they can be recognized from different sources, and thus watershed lines were drawn to separate them as shown in Figure  6 g. The cells were finally segmented and identified as shown in Figure  6 h.|$|R
40|$|In many {{remote sensing}} studies of {{geophysical}} {{fields such as}} clouds, land cover, or sea ice characteristics, the fractional area coverage of the field in an image is estimated as the proportion of pixels that have the characteristic of interest (i. e., {{are part of the}} field) as determined by some <b>thresholding</b> <b>operation.</b> The effect of sensor field-of-view on this estimate is examined by modeling the unknown distribution of subpixel area fraction with the beta distribution, whose two parameters depend upon the true fractional area coverage, the pixel size, and the spatial structure of the geophysical field. Since it is often not possible to relate digital number, reflectance, or temperature to subpixel area fraction, the statistical models described are used to determine the effect of pixel size and <b>thresholding</b> <b>operations</b> on the estimate of area fraction for hypothetical geophysical fields. Examples are given for simulated cumuliform clouds and linear openings in sea ice, whose spatial structures are described by an exponential autocovariance function.

Before recursive analysis begins, {{an estimate of the}} heavily textured (busy) areas is obtained. This estimate provides direction for the analytic process. If thresholding occurs over an area which is heavily textured, the output is handled in one of two ways.

If evidence indicates the extracted points belong exclusively to a heavily textured area, then they are discarded...|$|R
