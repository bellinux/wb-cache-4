2500|$|In 1988 Snow left CSX Transportation (the railroad) {{to become}} President and Chief Operating Officer of CSX Corporation (the holding company).

This is a common practice used by railroads to improve <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> investors while the tracks themselves fall into disrepair. Miles of mainline were subjected to slow orders as a result, increasing {{the need for more}} locomotives and rail cars, and thus costing the company more money.

Out of these, the number of double events in which pattern No. 1 would appear in the same combination, is 15 × 12 = 180. Therefore in 150 trials, the double event of pattern No. 1 would appear upon the average, on 180 divided by 150, or on 1·20 occasions. As a matter of fact, it appeared four times. These figures will be found in the first line of Table XXV.; the rest of its contents have been calculated in the same way.|$|E

5000|$|The glyph used in {{the modern}} Western world to {{represent}} the number 2 traces its roots back to the Brahmin Indians, who wrote [...] "2" [...] as two horizontal lines.

He recognised nature as <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> artists, commenting: [...] "I think artists should begin where Nature leaves off." [...] His colour linocuts exhibited a strong linear image, and his skills as a draughtsman allowed him to develop a sculptural element to his work. Woods frequently employed the technique of simplifying his subject matter by accentuating physical characteristics and omitting others entirely. He had an ability to capture form and light through simple line forms and use of unbroken colour. Many of his works show a flirtation with eroticism and exoticism.|$|E
