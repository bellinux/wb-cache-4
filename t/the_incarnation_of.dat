5|$|The {{belief of}} many {{followers}} that their founder was <b>the</b> <b>incarnation</b> <b>of</b> the Supreme God has also drawn criticism. According to Professor Raymond B. Williams, Swaminarayan was criticized because he received large gifts from his followers and dressed and traveled as a Maharaja {{even though he}} had taken the vows of renunciation of the world. Swaminarayan responded that he accepts gifts for the emancipation of his followers.|$|E
5|$|In the Agni Purana, as the enchanted Shiva follows Mohini, {{drops of}} his semen {{falls on the}} ground and become lingas, Shiva's symbols. His semen also generates the monkey-god Hanuman, who helps Vishnu's avatar Rama in his fight against Ravana in the Ramayana. Shiva Purana says that by the mere glimpse of Mohini, Shiva spurts out his seed. The seed was {{collected}} and poured into the ear of Anjani, who gave birth to Hanuman, <b>the</b> <b>incarnation</b> <b>of</b> Shiva. The latter is retold in the Thai and Malaysian version of the Ramayana. Though Hanuman strings from Shiva's seed, he is also considered as a combined son of Vishnu and Shiva.|$|E

5|$|In the prologue, John {{identifies}} Jesus as the Logos (Word). In Ancient Greek philosophy, {{the term}} logos meant {{the principle of}} cosmic reason. In this sense, it {{was similar to the}} Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of the Logos, applying it to Jesus, <b>the</b> <b>incarnation</b> <b>of</b> the Logos.|$|E

5|$|Christian doctrines {{include the}} beliefs that Jesus was {{conceived}} by the Holy Spirit, {{was born of}} a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge {{the living and the}} dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as <b>the</b> <b>incarnation</b> <b>of</b> God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.|$|E
