5|$|After {{a time of}} {{not seeing}} Tigerstar, Sasha returns to her den one evening, only to find Tigerstar already waiting for her. Asking him where he was, he {{comments}} on how nice her den was, and <b>then</b> <b>stops</b> and asks when she will be seeing her humans again, after seeing her collar hanging around a protruding branch on the logs. Sasha asks him why he was snooping around in her den, and he tells her that he cannot see her any more if she has the collar. She refuses to destroy it, and quarrels with Tigerstar about housecats {{and how they are}} not independent. Sad, she reminisces about her perfect life with Jean and Ken.|$|E
5|$|He them imprisons the Gandhara {{royal family}} in his prison. He gives them only one rice grain per {{prisoner}} and that too the left over food of the kaurava clan.The prisoners start {{fighting for the}} few rice grains thrown at them. The king of Gandhara <b>then</b> <b>stops</b> everyone from grabbing the little food that is provided. He says that instead of everyone dying, they could keep {{at least one of}} their princes alive. He chooses Shakuni to be alive. Shakuni takes an oath that he will do everything he can to destroy the entire Kaurava clan.The whole royal family except Shakuni dies in the prison. Shakuni makes magic dice from his father's spinal cord. The magic dice show exactly the number that he would want. Duryodhana takes pity on the lone prisoner, Shakuni after the rest of the Gandhara royal family dies in prison out of starvation. Shakuni joins the evil of coterie of Duryodhana, Karna and Dushyasana.|$|E
5|$|He then {{falls asleep}} {{continuing}} {{to play the}} note. A dream sequence of the opening scene of the film Chariots of Fire shows the characters running across a beach, though Mr. Bean dreams he is running with them. He begins to fall behind, until he hails a car to overtake all the others. Now running in front, Bean ensures he wins the race on the beach by tripping one of the runners trying to overtake him, whereupon he crosses the line with elation, and then wakes up. Finding {{that the rest of}} the orchestra have stopped playing while he continued his one recurring note, Bean, with encouragement from Rattle, plays an extended flourish and lastly touches a note that makes a flatulent sound, <b>then</b> <b>stops.</b>|$|E

40|$|Selective {{stopping}} paradigms address selectivity in controlled behavior, {{as subjects}} stop certain responses or responses to certain stimuli. The literature has discussed 2 strategies for selective stopping. First, selective stopping may prolong the stop process {{by adding a}} discrimination stage (Independent Discrim-inate <b>then</b> <b>Stop).</b> Second, selective stopping may involve <b>stopping</b> nonselectively and <b>then</b> restarting the response if the signal is an ignore signal (<b>Stop</b> <b>then</b> Discriminate). We discovered {{a variant of the}} first strategy that occurred often in our experiments and previously published experiments: The requirement to discriminate stop and ignore signals may interact with the go process, invalidating the independent race model (Dependent Discriminate <b>then</b> <b>Stop).</b> Our experiments focused on stimulus selective stopping, in which subjects stop to one signal and ignore another. When stop and ignore signals were equally likely, some subjects used the <b>Stop</b> <b>then</b> Discriminate strategy and others used the Dependent Discriminate <b>then</b> <b>Stop</b> strategy. When stop signals were more frequent than ignore signals, most subjects used the <b>Stop</b> <b>then</b> Discriminate strategy; when ignore signals were more frequent than stop signals, most subjects used the Dependent Discriminate <b>then</b> <b>Stop</b> strategy. The commonly accepted Independent Discriminate <b>then</b> <b>Stop</b> strategy was seldom implemented. Selective stopping was either not selective (<b>Stop</b> <b>then</b> Discrim-inate), or interacted with going (Dependent Discriminate <b>then</b> <b>Stop).</b> Implications for the cognitive science, lifespan development, clinical science, and neuroscience of selective stopping are discussed...|$|R

5|$|If the {{controller}} were to background garbage collect {{all of the}} spare blocks before it was absolutely necessary, new data written from the host could be written without having to move any data in advance, letting the performance operate at its peak speed. The trade-off {{is that some of}} those blocks of data are actually not needed by the host and will eventually be deleted, but the OS did not tell {{the controller}} this information. The result is that the soon-to-be-deleted data is rewritten to another location in the flash memory, increasing the write amplification. In some of the SSDs from OCZ the background garbage collection clears up {{only a small number of}} blocks <b>then</b> <b>stops,</b> thereby limiting the amount of excessive writes. Another solution is to have an efficient garbage collection system which can perform the necessary moves in parallel with the host writes. This solution is more effective in high write environments where the SSD is rarely idle. The SandForce SSD controllers and the systems from Violin Memory have this capability.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} view of Rihanna lying in open waters, as other scenes of {{diamonds}} being rolled in a manner suggestive of making a joint are intercut– a scene reminiscent of the single's artwork. As the video progresses Rihanna is shown running on a highway. In a black-and-white scene, Rihanna licks the joint and begins smoking it. The image fades to black as the song begins. Rihanna performs in the same black-and-white setting while in a black corset. Images of Rihanna on a bed in a room while singing are shown, with objects breaking, curtains falling and roses burning in reverse effect. Rihanna is shown again on the highway, running away from {{what appears to be the}} headlights of a chasing car. She <b>then</b> <b>stops</b> as she looks up to the night sky at an aurora view. Throughout the video, Rihanna's hand is shown intertwined with that of a heavily tattooed man, whose face is not shown in the video. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is shown in a desert where horses run freely. Scenes of a street battle are later shown, depicting burning cars and broken glass around the environment. As the video continues, the singer and her lover's hands are shown slowly slipping apart, with only their fingertips touching towards the conclusion of the video. The video ends with Rihanna once again floating alone in the open waters.|$|E

25|$|Lethal {{injection}} is {{the practice}} of injecting one or more drugs into a person (typically a barbiturate, paralytic, and potassium solution) {{for the express purpose}} of causing immediate death. The main application for this procedure is capital punishment, but the term may also be applied in a broader sense to include euthanasia and suicide. It first renders the person unconscious, and <b>then</b> <b>stops</b> the breathing and heart, in that order.|$|E
25|$|Typically {{the first}} stops were {{positioned}} {{in areas where}} the enemy was thought likely to pass through, often a riverbed or dry , where there was more vegetation impeding enemy movement.

Depending on the circumstances, the helibourne stops could form the main sweep line immediately upon insertion instead of waiting for the paratrooper elements of the force.|$|E

Each year, the Queen <b>then</b> <b>stops</b> at the gateway together with the Duke of Edinburgh. Standing before the central gateway, they then receive the salute of {{the remainder of the}} guards and then the mounted troops. As they file past, their regimental marches are played by the massed and mounted bands respectively. The Royal Family observes the spectacle from the balcony.|$|E

As the book draws to a close, Arthur {{is on his way to}} check out a possible university for Random, when, during a hyperspace jump, he is flung across alternate universes, has a brief encounter with Fenchurch, and ends up exactly where he would want to be. And then the Vogons turn up again.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Estragon dozes off and Vladimir rouses him but <b>then</b> <b>stops</b> {{him before}} he can share his dreams another {{recurring}} activity between the two men. Estragon wants to hear an old joke, which Vladimir cannot finish without going off to urinate, since every time he starts laughing, a kidney ailment flares up. Upon Vladimir's return, the increasingly jaded Estragon suggests that they hang themselves, but they abandon the idea when the logistics seem ineffective. They then speculate on the potential rewards of continuing to wait for Godot, but can come to no definite conclusions. When Estragon declares his hunger, Vladimir provides a carrot (among a collection of turnips), at which Estragon idly gnaws, loudly reiterating his boredom.|$|E

25|$|During the 20th century {{planting}} vines {{in countries}} where it was unknown was booming. However, it was shaky in places with higher temperatures during fermentation. The use of larger containers creates problems of fermentation: the yeasts produce heat which cannot escape and beyond 35°C the micro-organisms begin to suffer and fermentation slows <b>then</b> <b>stops.</b> After cooling the wine a new addition of yeast is needed to resume fermentation (not to mention the adverse effects on the wine's aromas {{and the risk of}} lactic bite). In California the search for temperature control of fermentation matured. Applied to white wine they revolutionized this type of wine. European wines, marked by their processes of crushing the grapes are diametrically opposed to those very fruity wines marked by a refreshing liveliness. During the years 1960–1990, these methods of wine-making moved to Europe and the use of refrigeration equipment is now widely used in almost all regions producing white wine.|$|E

Its conflict with the Cat, not only over the Cat's uninvited presence but also their inherent predator-prey relationship, provides the tension of the story.
