5|$|Anthony Dominick Benedetto (born August 3, 1926), known professionally as Tony Bennett, is an American {{singer of}} {{traditional}} pop standards, big band, show tunes, and jazz. He {{is also a}} painter, having created works under the name Anthony Benedetto <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> permanent public display in several institutions.

5|$|Memento was re-released in the UK on a 3-disc Special Edition DVD on December 27, 2004. This release {{contains}} all the special features <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> the two US releases in one package plus {{a couple of}} new interviews. The menus appear as tattoos on a body and are more straightforward than the US 2-disc limited edition DVD.|$|E
5|$|Argentodites is a {{possible}} multituberculate mammal from the Cretaceous of Argentina. The single species, Argentodites coloniensis, is known from a single blade-like fourth lower premolar (p4) from the La Colonia Formation, which is mostly or entirely Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) in age. The p4 is 4.15mm long and bears eight cusps on its upper margin and long associated ridges on both sides. The enamel consists of prisms that are completely or partly surrounded by a sheath and <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> average 6.57m apart. Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, who described and named the fossil in 2007, regarded it as a multituberculate, perhaps a cimolodontan—and thus, {{a member of a}} mostly Laurasian (northern) group and an immigrant to Argentina from North America—on the basis of the shape of the tooth and features of its enamel. In 2009, however, two teams argued that Argentodites may in fact be close to or identical with Ferugliotherium, a member of the small Gondwanan (southern) group Gondwanatheria; although their relationships are disputed, gondwanatheres may themselves be multituberculates.|$|E

5|$|Sphecius grandis {{has very}} similar nesting and feeding habits to {{other members of}} its genus, most notably Sphecius speciosus. As with S.speciosus, the female hunts for cicadas in low tree trunks, helped by the calls of the cicada males, and paralyses the insect by {{piercing}} {{the central nervous system}} with her stinger. She drags the cicadas back to her nest to place them in brood cells in which she eventually lays one egg per cell. Females carry cicadas <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> average 88% heavier than their own body mass. It has been hypothesised that cicada killers may also have the ability to capture cicadas mid-flight. There are approximately two or more cicadas to each brood cell. When the larvae hatch, the cicada provides nutrition for the offspring to feed on.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{lighting}} in the top spires and decoration. The first are the V-shaped lighting inserts in the steel of the building itself. Added later were groups of floodlights <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> mast arms directed back at the building. This allows {{the top of the}} building to be lit in many colors for special occasions. The tube lighting atop the building was added in 1981, although it {{had been part of the}} original design. Until 1998 the lights were turned off at 2a.m., but New York Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep the lights on until 6a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's Lights Out program, wherein the building turns off its lights during bird migration seasons.|$|E

25|$|The {{capacitive}} shunt method, described in an application note by Analog Devices, senses {{the change in}} capacitance between a transmitter and receiver <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> {{opposite sides of the}} sensor. The transmitter creates an electric field which oscillates at 200–300kHz. If a ground point, such as the finger, is placed between the transmitter and receiver, some of the field lines are shunted away, decreasing the apparent capacitance.|$|E
