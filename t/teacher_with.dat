40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the views of primary school <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> {{negative}} and positive attitudes towards rubrics comparatively in terms of various variables. 292 teachers from 17 primary schools in Ankara province of Turkey participated into the study. The data obtained from the views of <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> positive and negative attitudes towards rubrics were examined with figures. The findings indicated that the <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> positive attitudes towards the rubrics benefited from the rubrics more than the <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> negative attitudes when they were evaluating the achievement of the students in performance tasks. Both the <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> positive and negative attitudes stated that they had knowledge about the rubrics and they used the course books while getting this information. Moreover, the <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> negative attitudes consulted their colleagues more than the <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> positive attitudes. It was observed that the <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> positive attitudes prepared the rubrics themselves more often than the <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> negative attitudes and they used the information obtained from the rubrics for “observing the development of students’ higher order thinking skills” and “observing to what extent the students used their knowledge and skills in real life situations”.

5|$|Halvdan Koht {{was born}} on 7 August 1873 in Tromsø, {{one of the larger}} cities in Northern Norway. He was the second of four {{children}} born to Paul Steenstrup Koht (1844–1892), an educator and politician, and Betty Giæver (1845–1936), a part-time <b>teacher</b> <b>with</b> a penchant for singing, languages and drawing. Betty's antecedents were mixed: she was maternally descended from Northern Germany, yet on her father's side she was of Norwegian origin—a distinguished forebear on that side was her great-grandfather, the civil servant Jens Holmboe from Tromsø. Through the offspring of his maternal grand-uncle, Halvdan Koht was a third cousin of the parliamentarian Ola Krogseng Giæver. In Paul Koht's lineage, Kjeld Stub was a distant ancestor. The name Koht stems from German immigrants to Norway in the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|After her Carlisle victories, Ferrier {{began to}} receive offers of singing engagements. Her first {{appearance}} {{as a professional}} vocalist, in autumn 1937, was at a harvest festival celebration in the village church at Aspatria. She was paid one guinea. After winning the gold cup at the 1938 Workington Festival, Ferrier sang Ma Curly-Headed Babby in a concert at Workington Opera House. Cecil McGivern, producer of a BBC Northern radio variety show, was in the audience and was sufficiently impressed to book her for the next edition of his programme, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 23 February 1939. This broadcast—her first as a vocalist—attracted wide attention, and led to more radio work, though for Ferrier the event was overshadowed {{by the death of}} her mother at the beginning of February. At the 1939 Carlisle Festival, Ferrier sang Richard Strauss's song All Souls' Day, a performance which particularly impressed one of the adjudicators, J. E. Hutchinson, a music <b>teacher</b> <b>with</b> a considerable reputation. Ferrier became his pupil and, under his guidance, began to extend her repertoire to include works by Bach, Handel, Brahms and Elgar.|$|E
5|$|In the yeshiva world, the {{brightest}} students are highly desirable as chavrusas. However, there are {{pros and cons}} to learning with chavrusas who are stronger, weaker, or equal in knowledge and ability to the student. A stronger chavrusa will correct and fill in the student's knowledge and help him improve his learning techniques, acting more like a <b>teacher.</b> <b>With</b> a chavrusa who is equal in knowledge and ability, the student is forced to prove his point with logic rather than by right of seniority, which improves his ability to think logically, analyze other people's opinions objectively, and accept criticism. With a weaker chavrusa, who often worries over and questions each step, the student is forced to understand the material thoroughly, refine and organize his thoughts in a logical structure, present his viewpoint clearly, {{and be ready to}} justify each and every point. The stronger chavrusa helps the student acquire a great deal of information, but the weaker chavrusa helps the student learn how to learn. Yeshiva students are usually advised to have one of each of these three types of chavrusas in order to develop on all three levels.|$|E

40|$|Problem. The {{purpose in}} this study was to {{determine}} if student teachers who have high internal locus of control and those who have high external locus of control approach student teaching differently and whether they interpret their experiences in a different manner. ^ Procedure. The study included administering the Rotter I-E Scale to twenty-eight University of Nebraska-Lincoln teacher education majors who were beginning their student teaching experience in two Lincoln Public Schools junior high schools and two Lincoln Public Schools senior high schools. The Rotter I-E Scale was used to identify four student <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> high internal locus of control and four student <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> high external locus of control. ^ An ethnographic approach for completing the study was utilized, and the collection of data consisted of three separate sources [...] observations, interviews, and videotapes. Each student teacher was observed three times during the student teaching experience, notes were taken during the observation, and each student teacher was interviewed following the observation. Transcriptions of the taped interview were made. Four videotapes were made of consenting student teachers (two student <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> internal locus of control and two student <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> external locus of control) as they conducted a lesson in their classroom. ^ Information from the observations, interviews and videotapes were gathered and analyzed. Comparisons were noted among the student <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> internal control, among the student <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> external control, and between the internal and external locus of control student teachers. ^ Findings. Some conclusions from this study were: (1) Student <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> internal locus of control expressed more confidence in themselves than student <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> external locus of control. (2) Student <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> internal control attempted to check for their students 2 ̆ 7 understanding of concepts more frequently than student <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> external control. (3) Internal locus of control student teachers did not express as much concern regarding discipline as external locus of control student teachers.

40|$|Although {{substantial}} {{work has}} been done regarding the effectiveness of social emotional learning (SEL) programming at the elementary level, additional research is needed at the secondary level to investigate factors that impact program implementation and effectiveness within middle school contexts. These factors include classroom structures and teachers’ and students’ characteristics. In this dissertation, a mixed methods case study design was employed to investigate the roles teachers’ characteristics, beliefs, and attitudes play in the implementation of a school-wide SEL approach known as Developmental Designs (DD). This teaching approach specifically addresses the need for relationship- and community-building practices in middle school classrooms through teacher professional development. Classroom observations were matched <b>with</b> <b>teacher</b> interviews to place 24 middle school teachers, identifying as 60 % male, 78 % white, 18 % African American, and 5 % Latino, into one of four typologies: · low-implementing <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> highly engaged classrooms · low-implementing <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> low-engaged classrooms · high-implementing <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> highly engaged classrooms · high-implementing <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> low-engaged classrooms High-implementing teachers, regardless of whether they had a low- or highly engaged classroom, held beliefs that SEL was necessary to establish classroom climate for the normative academic and social development of students; whereas low-implementing teachers expressed a deficit-minded attitudes towards need for SEL initiatives. However, when typologies were collapsed by engagement status (observed highly engaged classroom vs. observed low-engaged classrooms), integrating SEL practices was more salient to <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> highly engaged classrooms. Additionally, <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> highly engaged classrooms demonstrated via interviews and observations that relationship building and proactive classroom management were priorities and professional strengths. The key emergent theme among <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> highly engaged classrooms (regardless of implementation status) was classroom control. Low-implementing <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> highly engaged classrooms demonstrated more authoritarianism during interviews and classroom observations, whereas high-implementing <b>teachers</b> <b>with</b> highly engaged classrooms were more constructivist in classroom structure, management, and philosophy. Student surveys (N= 325; 50 % Free/reduced priced lunch; identifying as 30 % white, 30 % African American, 17 % Latino, 11 % Asian, 9 % “Other”) substantiated certain qualitative thematic findings: students reported feeling more supported and socially efficacious <b>with</b> high-implementing <b>teachers.</b> However, these findings also called for greater nuanced interpretation of student engagement...|$|R
