25|$|Unable {{to confront}} the British directly, Greene {{dispatched}} a force under Daniel Morgan to recruit additional troops. Morgan then defeated <b>the</b> <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British army under Tarleton on January 17, 1781, at Cowpens.

Despite the setbacks, Cornwallis proceeded to advance into North Carolina, gambling that he would receive substantial Loyalist support. Greene evaded combat with Cornwallis, instead wearing his army down through a protracted war of attrition. By March, Greene's army had grown enough where he felt confident in facing Cornwallis. The two armies engaged at Guilford Courthouse on March 15, and, though Greene was beaten, Cornwallis' army had suffered irreplaceable casualties. Compounding this, far fewer Loyalists were joining as expected due to effective Patriot suppression. Cornwallis' casualties were such that he was compelled to retreat to Wilmington for reinforcement, leaving the interior of the Carolinas, and Georgia, wide open to Greene.|$|E

500|$|The acidity of {{dromedary}} milk {{stored at}} [...] increases {{at a slower}} rate than that of cow milk. Though the preparation of butter from dromedary milk is difficult, it {{has been carried out}} successfully in 1959 in the USSR. <b>The</b> <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dromedary milk, containing 4.2% fat, yielded 25.8% butter. In 2001, the ability of dromedary milk to form curd was studied; coagulation did not show curd formation, and had a pH of 4.4. It was much different from curd produced from cow milk, and had a fragile, heterogeneous composition probably composed of casein flakes. Nevertheless, cheese and other dairy products can be made from camel milk. A study found bovine calf rennet could be used to coagulate dromedary milk. A special factory has been set up in Nouakchott to pasteurise and make cheese from camel milk. Mystical beliefs surround the use of camel milk in some places; for example, it may be used as an aphrodisiac in Ethiopia.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{potential}} use of flaxseed {{protein isolate}} (FPI) as an emulsifying agent was studied {{in combination with}} whey protein isolate (WPI) or alone. All the FPI and WPI–FPI emulsions were kinetically unstable. <b>The</b> increase <b>of</b> FPI concentration (0. 7 % w/v) led to a higher <b>creaming</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FPI emulsions due partly {{to a reduction in}} interfacial tension between aqueous and oil phases, but mainly to the gel network formation. However at this same high FPI concentration, WPI–FPI emulsions showed a decrease in droplet size and creaming stability, which could be due to <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> flaxseed gum in the protein isolate enhancing depletion effects. A protein excess was verified in the mixed systems (0. 14 or 0. 7 % (w/v) FPI) and <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> FPI concentration led to an even greater surface protein content. Increasing homogenization conditions (pressure and number <b>of</b> passes), <b>the</b> <b>creaming</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FPI systems increased, mainly at higher concentration (0. 7 % w/v). Meanwhile, in the mixed systems, <b>the</b> <b>creaming</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emulsions containing 0. 7 % (w/v) FPI decreased even more, but was improved for the emulsions with 0. 14 % (w/v) FPI. Thus, it was observed that systems containing only FPI at higher concentration were stabilized by gel formation, while in WPI–FPI systems there was a competition by interface between biopolymers with a consequent depletion process. As a result, more stable systems were obtained with WPI addition at lower FPI concentration (0. 14 % w/v) and using higher homogenization pressure and number of passes (60 MPa, two passes) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work {{investigates the}} physical-chemical {{evolution}} during artificial aging in water of four commercialized sunscreens containing TiO 2 -based nanocomposites.

The results showed that a significant fraction of nano-TiO 2 residues was released from all sunscreens, despite their heterogeneous behaviors. A stable dispersion of submicronic aggregates of nanoparticles was generated, representing up to 38 w/w% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> sunscreen, and containing up to 30 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total nano-TiO 2 initially present in <b>the</b> <b>creams.</b> <b>The</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dispersion was tested {{as a function of}} salt concentration, revealing that in seawater conditions, a major part of these nano-TiO 2 residues will aggregate and sediment.
