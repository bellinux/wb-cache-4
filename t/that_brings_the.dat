5|$|The {{story begins}} with Aya {{returning}} home from a rough day at work. After relaxing on her bed, she receives {{a phone call from}} her father, who wants to have dinner with her; however, she declines by lying about still being at work. The narrator then reminisces about Aya's childhood and family life, particularly dwelling upon how her maturity and independence had created distance between her and her father, who is increasingly lonely yet happy for her. Later that night, Aya awakes to another phone call from her father. Having learned of Mii's death, she visits her father and has lunch with him, an experience <b>that</b> <b>brings</b> <b>the</b> two closer together. Aya later visits her father to see the new kitten he buys. At the same time, her mother rings the doorbell and the family is reunited, their happiness renewed.|$|E

In general, {{it is not true}} that one can get a canonical form for the elements, by stepwise cancellation. One may have to use relations to expand a string many-fold, in order eventually to find a cancellation <b>that</b> <b>brings</b> <b>the</b> length right down.|$|E

25|$|Biochemical and {{structural}} data for E1 revealed a mechanism of activation of TPP coenzyme by forming the conserved hydrogen bond with glutamate residue (Glu59 in human E1) and by imposing a V-conformation <b>that</b> <b>brings</b> <b>the</b> N4’ atom of the aminopyrimidine to intramolecular hydrogen bonding with the thiazolium C2 atom. This unique combination of contacts and conformations of TPP leads to {{formation of the}} reactive C2-carbanion, eventually. After the cofactor TPP decarboxylates pyruvate, the acetyl portion becomes a hydroxyethyl derivative covalently attached to TPP.|$|E
25|$|Esther Stutzman, {{who works}} as a {{receptionist}} in a doctor's office, also experiences a close call with Nazi policies when her friends Richard and Maria Klein, closeted Jews like herself, bring their ailing eight-month-old baby, Paul, in for a checkup. The diagnosis, Tay-Sachs disease, is a disease known to be prevalent among Jews. A subsequent investigation into his family background would spell doom for his parents and any names they might be forced to reveal under torture. Although Esther's husband, Walther, is able to hack into the Reich's computer network and change the Klein's family history, it is the revelation that Reichsführer-SS Lothar Prützmann has a nephew with Tay-Sachs <b>that</b> <b>brings</b> <b>the</b> investigation to a halt.|$|E

The New York City Police Department (NYPD) usually advises the media as to when this will happen in cases that may be of interest; other large departments do not, so photographers and camera crews wait at the central location in hopes of getting a perp-walk image. In 2011, some New York camera crews and photographers waited 15 hours for former International Monetary Fund director Dominique Strauss-Kahn to be brought by for his arraignment on charges of sexually assaulting a hotel maid.|$|E

25|$|A {{mechanical}} grape harvester {{works by}} beating the vine with rubber sticks {{to get the}} vine to drop its fruit onto a conveyor belt <b>that</b> <b>brings</b> <b>the</b> fruit to a holding bin. As technology improves mechanical harvesters have become more sophisticated in distinguishing grape clusters from mud, leaves and other particles. Despite the improvement many harvesters still have difficulties in distinguishing between ripe, healthy grapes and unripe or rotted bunches which must then be sorted out at the winemaking facility. Another disadvantage is the potential of damaging the grape skins which can cause maceration and coloring of the juice that is undesirable {{in the production of}} white and sparkling wine. The broken skins also bring the risk of oxidation and a loss of some of the aromatic qualities in the wine.|$|E
25|$|Green tea is {{processed}} and grown {{in a variety}} of ways, {{depending on the type of}} green tea desired. As a result of these methods, maximum amounts of polyphenols and volatile organic compounds are retained, affecting aroma and taste. The growing conditions can be broken down into two basic types − those grown in the sun and those grown under the shade. The green tea plants are grown in rows that are pruned to produce shoots in a regular manner, and in general are harvested three times per year. The first flush takes place in late April to early May. The second harvest usually takes place from June through July, and the third picking takes place in late July to early August. Sometimes, there will also be a fourth harvest. It is the first flush in the spring <b>that</b> <b>brings</b> <b>the</b> best-quality leaves, with higher prices to match.|$|E
500|$|Act 3 is {{dominated}} by Orfeo's aria [...] "Possente spirto e formidabil nume" [...] by which he attempts to persuade Caronte {{to allow him to}} enter Hades. Monteverdi's vocal embellishments and virtuoso accompaniment provide what Tim Carter has described as [...] "one of the most compelling visual and aural representations" [...] in early opera. In Act 4 the warmth of Proserpina's singing on behalf of Orfeo is retained until Orfeo fatally [...] "looks back". The brief final act, which sees Orfeo's rescue and metamorphosis, is framed by the final appearance of the ritornello and by a lively moresca <b>that</b> <b>brings</b> <b>the</b> audience back to their everyday world.|$|E

500|$|As the {{high-speed}} maneuvers finished at 13:30, Waddle called for Greeneville {{to perform an}} emergency dive (called an [...] "emergency deep") followed by an emergency main ballast blow, a maneuver <b>that</b> <b>brings</b> <b>the</b> submarine from a depth of about [...] to the surface {{in a few seconds}} by using high-pressure air to force the water out of the ship's ballast tanks as quickly as possible. [...] The rise is so rapid that the submarine's bow rises high out of the water upon surfacing. [...] Before executing this maneuver, the submarine was required to go to periscope depth to check for ships or dangerous obstacles on the surface. [...] After completing {{the high-speed}} maneuvers, standing orders called for the submarine to hold a steady course for three minutes to reestablish sonar contact, which had been disrupted by the high speed maneuvers, with any vessels in the area. [...] In this case, however, Waddle ordered the submarine to change course and go to periscope depth after holding the steady course for only 90 seconds.|$|E

We have assembled three individuals with extremely varied backgrounds {{to serve as the}} judges. They are smart and talented, with terrific instincts and great chemistry, and are sure to create a hot bench." [...] The panel of judges consist of New York State Supreme Court judge Patricia DiMango, and Los Angeles attorneys Tanya Acker and Larry Bakman. As with Judge Judy, Hot Bench is executive-produced by Randy Douthit, and produced by CBS Television Distribution.
