500|$|In April 1994, Professor Elizabeth Newson {{published}} Video Violence and the Protection of Children (the [...] "Newson Report") which attracted huge media {{interest due}} to its claims that it had [...] "definitively established the long sought-for link between screen violence and the real-life variety," [...] and which cited the Capper murder as an example. Despite its support by the press, however, the report failed to demonstrate any definitive link, [...] "merely drawing inferences from... often highly speculative accounts in the press rather than independent first-hand research." [...] Newson was called <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>oral</b> <b>evidence</b> to the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee on Video Violence, where she asserted: [...] "The Suzanne Capper case {{is another example of}} very explicit imitation of video and the use of video and that was Child's Play 3." [...] The chairman of the committee, Sir Ivan Lawrence had to point out to Newson that this was incorrect, and that both the police and the British Board of Film Classification had ruled out any connection between the movie and the murder.|$|E

Born was invited in 2005 <b>to</b> <b>give</b> written and <b>oral</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> the House of Lords Select Committee on BBC Charter Review, and has lectured to public service broadcasters in Europe and Australia as well as to broadcasting and journalist trade unions in Britain and Europe.|$|R

50|$|The {{court is}} {{required}} first to consider, in principle, {{whether or not}} bail should be granted, and then to enquire into a suitable {{amount of money in}} view of the accused's circumstances.

50|$|If {{the court}} is {{of the opinion that}} it is proper to hear oral {{evidence}} in terms of HCR 6(5)(g), the court may determine which persons to call as witnesses; it may also determine the issues in respect of which oral evidence must be presented.

50|$|When a {{contract}} {{has been reduced}} to writing and litigation subsequently takes place concerning the contract or its terms, it happens not infrequently that one, if not both, of the parties desires <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>oral</b> <b>evidence</b> to show that the terms of the contract were other than those embodied in the document. A party relying on a written contract must prove its existence, and obviously oral evidence by or for him is admissible for that purpose. It follows that the other party to the case may in turn, by oral evidence, prove facts that show the written document did not constitute {{a contract}} at all—for example, that it was forged.|$|E

50|$|Egerton {{attended}} the House of Lords <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>oral</b> <b>evidence.</b> A report {{came out in}} 1946 in which the principle of comprehensive system was endorsed. The Legal Aid and Advice Act was passed in 1949. He was then asked by Sir George Hayes - Director of the National Council for Social Service to be honorary legal advisor to the National Citizen’s Advice Bureau. Egerton later became the Vice Chair of the National Council of the Citizen’s Advice Bureau. During his time in this post he dealt with concern over legal advice offered by CAB workers and dealt with legal profession issues. He {{was a member of}} the Lord Chancellor’s Departmental Committee (the Payne Committee) to abolish imprisonment for the non-payment of debt. He also served on the National Council for Social Service on Charitable fundraising.|$|E
50|$|Reviews are {{conducted}} {{in the form of}} a private hearing before a three-member panel, consisting of a senior member who is generally legally qualified, a services member and a member. Services members are appointed from those nominated by ex-service organisations and generally have extensive military service experience, including operational service. Applicants appearing before the Board are generally represented by lay advocates who are experienced in the jurisdiction. Representation by legal practitioners or legally qualified persons is prohibited by the VEA. While there is a right of appearance for the Repatriation Commission or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission, the practice is they do not appear. The Board is provided with all relevant material relied upon by the original decision maker. Additional evidence may be produced or called at the hearing. It is not usual for expert witnesses to be called <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>oral</b> <b>evidence.</b> Instead the Board relies upon written reports.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of the appointment, the Judiciary became divided between those judges of the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court who {{supported}} Ward and judges and magistrates who supported the appointment of Gates as Chief Justice. The Court of Appeal judges who continued to sit heard a number of appeals against Chief Justice Gates' decisions, and in almost all cases overruled him. The Court of Appeal even ordered Chief Justice <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>oral</b> <b>evidence</b> at the appeal hearing in Ratu Takiveikata's matter. This was an order which was unprecedented in Fiji's history. Takiveikata was charged with inciting a mutiny at the Queen Elizabeth Barracks intended to remove Commodore Bainimarama as the Commander of the Fiji military. The attempt failed because the majority of soldiers remained loyal to the Commodore. However, after Takiveikata was convicted by Justice Gates two business associates who were his neighbors and friends provided affidavits in the Court of appeal. They alleged that Justice Gates had told them at a party for Bastille Day that he would imprison the accused after the trial. Later the Court of Appeal held that a doubt had been created by the evidence of the defendant's friends and neighbors and quashed the convictions. A retrial was ordered. In the judgment the Court of Appeal failed to consider if the trial had been fairly conducted by Chief Justice Gates, a consideration which is ordinarily mandatory in cases where judicial bias is raised. On retrial Ratu Takiveikata was convicted by the High Court and sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
50|$|Anne Hurst, {{spokeswoman}} for Maypole Women, an organisation that supports women through divorce, said:The proposed change will increase children's exposure to conflict and abuse, increase economic inequality, and create no incentive for fathers' increased involvement from their child's birth. Children who actively reject a parent — either the abusive or non-abusive parent — usually {{do so in}} a context of high parental conflict and domestic abuse. Cutting off contact can be a response to alienation tactics, or a coping mechanism. It also did not fully reflect the position of Fathers4Justice, and the group criticised the Coalition for not implementing its agenda in full. The Justice Select Committee considered the draft Children & Families Bill in pre-legislative hearings, but F4J chose to not participate, applying 'late' <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>oral</b> <b>evidence,</b> and on issues outside the remit of the Committee. At point 144, the Select Committee's report noted:The organisation Fathers 4 Justice contacted us in the late stages of our inquiry and asked for an invitation to provide oral evidence. They had not responded to our original Call for Evidence nor to the Government's Co-operative Parenting Consultation. We offered them the opportunity to provide written evidence on matters within our terms of reference for the inquiry, but they declined. We have not, therefore, had the benefit of their views. This meant the group's position on shared parenting was not reflected in the draft Bill, yet the group criticised the Bill nonetheless. The group later also refused offers from MPs sitting on the Bill Committee to table amendments on behalf of the group, meaning the group missed the chance of amending the Bill to better reflect its objectives.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Simulation {{provides}} a non-judgemental environment where trainees learn skills without compromising patients’safety or dignity. It also provides safe environment where anxiety-provoking, real-life clinical situations can be recreated and repeatedly practiced. Mental health review tribunal is an anxiety provoking experience for higher trainees {{and use of}} simulation can alleviate this anxiety. Aims: To develop trainees’ skills in writing of tribunal reports and <b>giving</b> <b>oral</b> <b>evidence</b> using simulation technique (ST). Objective: To facilitate trainees’ familiarisation {{with the process of}} Mental Health tribunal and improve their skills in completing report and <b>giving</b> <b>oral</b> <b>evidence</b> using ST. Methods: There are 2 sessions: one half-day session of interactive teaching providing fundamental details on essential elements of the tribunal process, duties and report. This is followed by 4 -weeks gap to allow participants to prepare and submit anonymised patients’ reports to the panel. Finally, a second full day of presentation and cross-examination by (real) tribunal panel with 25 -minutes of formative feedback. Results: Six trainees participated in the pilot: A high percentage of participants strongly agreed or agreed that ST is an effective learning experience for tribunal report writing and cross-examination by the panel. Similar proportion agreed that ST helped to facilitate familiarisation with the tribunal process and that it is a satisfactory teaching method. Finally, all participants agreed that ST helped to achieve personal objectives for attending the seminar. Conclusions: Simulation in psychiatry is becoming an effective learning experience. The outcome of this pilot on report writing and cross-examination by tribunal panels how its increasing effectiveness and relevance in psychiatry...|$|R
