40|$|Mastitis {{prevention}} and control programmes {{were developed in}} the 1960 s and have since been adopted with considerable success. Our data for {{a convenience sample of}} 45 Flemish dairy farms demonstrate that the well-known "five-point {{prevention and}} control programme" is still not, or not adequately, implemented. For example, only 18 % of the dairy farmers prestripped their cows and wiped the <b>teats</b> <b>using</b> single-use dry towels before attaching the milking units. Although about 70 % of the farms practised post-milking teat disinfection (dipping or spraying), 40 % of the farmers did this inadequately. On only one farm were cows with clinical mastitis treated both locally and parenterally for at least 3 days, and on only 7 % of the dairy farms was the udder health status of the herd systematically monitored. According to the dairy farmers, the extra labour and stress caused by udder health problems were the most troublesome aspects of mastitis. On the basis of this study, it can be concluded that bovine practitioners in the Flemish region should critically evaluate the mastitis management of their clients (farmers) and motivate them to implement an efficient mastitis prevention programme...|$|R

Ultrasonography was performed on 48 <b>teats</b> <b>using</b> ultrasound SonoScape A 5 v (SonoScape, China) with multifrequency linear transducer (5 – 12 MHz). The potential of the imaging technique to visualize teat structures as well as teat canal length and diameter, the diameter in the area of the rosette of Furstenberg, teat wall thickness, teat cistern diameter in its middle part and teat cistern diameter in teat base was evaluated. Scans were conducted before milking, immediately after milking, and 1 and 2 hours after milking. The average teat canal length measured by ultrasound was 8. 48 ± 1. 41 mm before milking, and until the 2 nd post milking hour its size became statistically significantly (p< 0. 001) lower (7. 48 ± 0. 93 mm). Teat canal diameter showed a significant difference (p< 0. 01) only immediately after milking compared to the size before milking. The diameter of the middle part and the base of the teat cistern also tended to decrease considerably after milking (p< 0. 001) as compared to premilking values. The teat wall thickness immediately after milking and 1 hour after milking were statistically significantly higher (p< 0. 001) compared to the premilking size.

In orlder to {{find out}} the law between {{conductivity}} of polyglycol aliphatic acid ester and concentration and polymerization degree, the relationship between conductivity of polyglycol aliphatic acid ester and concentration and polymerization degree was <b>teated</b> by <b>using</b> DDS-II conductivity experimen instrument, by taking a typical polyethylene glycol 200 (400, 600) dilaurate as the research object. Firstly, the conductivities at the water content from 10 % to 90 % were tested in the room temperatrure. The results showed that conductivity of the same emulsion increases with increasing the water content, then decreases with increasing the water content. This is because that the emulsion is the O/W emulsion, conductivity increases with increasing the water content. Then the liquid crystal is generated in the emulsion leading to the increase trend of conductivity slowing down. The emulsion changs into the W/O emulsion at last resulting in conductivity decreases with increasing the water content. Secondly, the relationship between conductivity of emulsion and polymerization degree were tested. The results of the experiment show that: the higher the polymerization degree, the smaller the conductivity o f the emulsion is. The reason is the higher the polymerization degree, the less the conductible ions of the emulsion is, finally cause the conductivity changs smaller and smaller...|$|R

The difference in the teat end thickness before and after milking is a parameter to study the response of <b>teat</b> tissue to <b>used</b> parameters or to the liner of Vacuum level for opening the teat sphincter and the change in the teat end wall thickness in response to the machine milking of indigenous Greek goat...|$|R
50|$|If {{the female}} macropod {{does in fact}} becomes {{pregnant}} the new embryo (called a blastocyst) is put {{into a state of}} suspended animation. The blastocyst will remain in this state until such a time when its brother or sister is old enough to vacate the pouch. As soon as the little pademelon is old enough to leave the pouch the stalled embryo begins developing again Even once a young pademelon vacates the pouch it often pops its head back in to suckle. It only <b>uses</b> the <b>teat</b> that it <b>used</b> during the time it was in its mother’s pouch. This allows the mother to supply two different types of milk for the more developed offspring that has left the pouch, and another for the less developed offspring that is still in the pouch. This reproductive system known as the embryonic diapause, is found in honey possums, bats and seals {{as well as the other}} macropods. It is an extremely efficient reproductive system and if a young animal dies or is lost from the pouch, immediate development of the blastocyst replaces it quite quickly.|$|R
40|$|A pele da teta é uma das principais fontes de contaminação microbiana do leite cru, além de ser uma fonte de infecção da glândula mamária. Este estudo comparou diferentes métodos de preparação do úbere, incluindo a participação do bezerro para estimular a descida do leite, em relação à contaminação microbiana da pele da teta. Um experimento com 36 vacas ordenhadas mecanicamente foi conduzido para comparar três procedimentos (A, B, C) de preparação do úbere. Duas tetas de cada vaca foram amostradas para contagem total de bactérias (CTB) e de coliformes, antes e após lavagem com água e secagem com papel toalha descartável (A); procedimento A, mais imersão das tetas em solução de iodo (4. 000 ppm) e secagem com papel toalha descartável (B); higienização com toalha de papel embebida em solução desinfetante contendo clorexidina (C). O segundo experimento incluiu 16 vacas ordenhadas manualmente, na presença do bezerro. Permitiu-se a cada bezerro mamar as quatro tetas por alguns segundos, de acordo com o manejo do rebanho. Amostras para bacteriologia de duas tetas de cada vaca foram coletadas, antes, após a mamada do bezerro, e após higienização semelhante ao procedimento C, citado acima. Os tratamentos foram analisados usando-se o teste não- paramétrico de Kruskal-Wallis, considerando-se os dados de tCTB após o uso de um dos métodos de preparação do úbere ou da mamada do bezerro. Usou-se a transformação das contagens bacterianas para a escala logarítmica em base 10, com a fórmula tCTB=log 10 (CTB+ 0, 5). Para os grupos A, B e C (primeiro experimento), os valores médios de diminuição de tCTB foram 1, 8, 2, 2 e 2, 4, respectivamente. No segundo experimento, as CTB's aumentaram significativamente (P The teat skin {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{microbial}} contamination of raw milk as well as a source of mastitis infection. This study assessed the microbial load of the teat skin following the application of the different practices for preparing the udder, including the use of calf suckling to stimulate the letdown of milk. Thirty-six cows milked by machine were included in one experiment. Two teats of each cow were sampled for bacteriology before and after using one of three methods of udder preparation, as follows: rinsing with water and drying with single paper towels (A); method A plus pre-dipping with an iodine teat dip (4, 000 ppm) and drying with single paper towels (B); wiping <b>teats</b> <b>using</b> a commercial wet non-woven wipe pre-soaked with a solution containing chlorexidine (C). The second experiment included 16 cows milked by hand. The calf of each cow was allowed to suck the four teats for a few seconds, and then two teats per cow were sampled for bacteriology. Samples were collected before, after calf sucking and following teat pre-milking treatment (as for group C, above). Statistical analysis was conducted on transformed (log 10) data with tTBC=log 10 (TBC+ 0. 5) using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Each treatment was analysed considering the difference in tTBC after the use of either method of preparation of the udder or calf sucking. For groups A, B and C (first experiment), tTBC values were reduced 1. 8, 2. 2 and 2. 4, respectively. In the second experiment, tTBC increased significantly (P< 0, 05) after calf sucking (from 3. 2 to 4. 3). After disinfection the tTBC was significantly reduced to 2. 0. These results show that: (a) teat rinsing with water and wiping dry reduces the number of microorganisms on the teat skin, but the reduction is significantly higher when teats are disinfected; (b) calf sucking before milking increases significantly the number of microorganisms on teat skin; (c) the number of microorganisms on teat skin can be reduced more than 10 times after calf sucking if teats are disinfected. Very low numbers or no growth of coliforms were observed in all cases...|$|R

Other data were obtained via a structured questionnaire and from {{the records of the}} Ontario Milk Marketing Board. Many producers have not adopted practices that have been advocated for the integrated control of mastitis. For example, 43. 3 % of producers surveyed used single service paper towels, 63. 3 % regularly <b>used</b> <b>teat</b> dip and 56. 5 % dry cow therapy. The mean of the average monthly somatic cell count for all producers for 1978 was 621. 1 x 10 (3) cells/mL. This latter value was used to divide the producers into case (higher than average) and control (lower than average) groups. Control herds averaged 95. 9 liters more shipped milk per cow per month than case herds. Milk from control herds averaged 0. 22 percentage points higher than case herds for each of average fat and lactose, and 0. 16 percentage points higher for protein. The linear regression of monthly shipped milk on the respective monthly bulk tank somatic cell count indicated a loss of 13. 26 L/cow/month for each 100, 000 increase in somatic cell count...|$|R
40|$|A higher milking frequency, as a {{consequence}} of milking with an automated milking system, incorporates a threat to teat condition. To study the effect of transition from conventional to automated milking on teat skin and teat end condition, 40 lactating Holstein-Friesian cows and heifers from a high yielding dairy herd were randomly allocated to either a conventional or an automated milking system group. In the latter group, automated milking was initiated during the study period, while conventional milking was continued in the control group. Teat skin and teat end condition were evaluated weekly on quarter level for all animals from 5 wk before until 8 wk after transition. A high emollient iodine <b>teat</b> dip was <b>used</b> on all cows during the study period. Teat skin condition of the animals in the automated milking system group was consistent from before and during milking with the automated milking system. Rear teats had a better skin and end condition than front teats. Evolution of teat end condition over time between the automated and conventional milking groups was not statistically different. Heifers, however, seemed to be more sensitive to the change than multiparous cows, as their teat end condition slightly decreased.
