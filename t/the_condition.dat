5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people who smoke, {{and there is also}} a correlation between habit duration and severity of <b>the</b> <b>condition.</b> Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen <b>the</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E
5|$|At least 40% {{of people}} with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have a positive family history, suggesting {{that some people are}} genetically predisposed to suffering with oral ulceration. HLA-B12, HLA-B51, HLA-Cw7, HLA-A2, HLA-A11, and HLA-DR2 are examples of human leukocyte antigen types associated with aphthous stomatitis. However, these HLA types are inconsistently associated with <b>the</b> <b>condition,</b> and also vary according to ethnicity. People who have a positive family history of aphthous stomatitis tend to develop a more severe form of <b>the</b> <b>condition,</b> and at an earlier age than is typical.|$|E

40|$|Neutrophil {{activity}} was elevated in <b>the</b> <b>conditioned</b> mice for <b>the</b> first time through an established conditioned training process. Catecholamines were {{proved to be}} important in the regulation of this conditioned innate immunity. In the study, the camphor odor (as <b>the</b> <b>conditioned</b> stimulus, CS) and poly I: C (as the unconditioned stimulus, US) was used to conditionally elevate the activity of the splenic neutrophils. The mechanism(s) responsible for <b>the</b> <b>conditioned</b> enhancement of neutrophil {{activity was}} further investigated using the neurochemical blocking assay and immunohistochemical analysis. Results showed that the neutrophil activity was significantly enhanced through <b>the</b> <b>conditioned</b> training process; both reserpine and 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) significantly blocked this conditioned innate immunity at <b>the</b> <b>conditioned</b> recall stage. Dexamethasone (Dex), however, showed no effect on <b>the</b> <b>conditioned</b> neutrophil response. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) -positive cells significantly increased in the locus coeruleus (LC), hypothalamus, and cortex but not in the spleen of <b>the</b> <b>conditioned</b> animals. These results indicate that during <b>the</b> <b>conditioned</b> recall stage, <b>the</b> brain signals the splenic neutrophils via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) by releasing the peripheral catecholamines in spleen. The activation of the SNS, on the other hand, is also under the influence of catecholamines released in the LC. The hypothalamic pituitary (HP) axis, on the other hand, plays no role in the regulation of <b>the</b> <b>conditioned</b> neutrophil response. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
