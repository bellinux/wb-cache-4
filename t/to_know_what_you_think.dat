6000|$|... "I guess not, pap. I'd like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you're a-doin' sendin' me 'way back there. Boomtown's {{good enough}} fer me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See, such {{a parcel}} of reading books. I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of setting {{them up with}} 'Jane Sparks', as it is week-day teaching." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I want to {{talk with}} you. She's out, with Lottie; and when she comes back I will tell her what you say. But I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Link. You didn't expect I'd {{follow you}} so soon, did you?" [...] cried Roger. [...] "Now, I've {{got a nice}} account to settle with <b>you.</b> I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did with my suit-case, and I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean by impersonating me." ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. I don't want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> don't think, I {{want the}} fact.|$|R
60|$|MRS. H. I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{meant by}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> said just now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{what would}} they wish for? I can do {{something}} towards preparing them, and I can teach Thekla, but I should like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{would be best for}} them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must speak}} to you of my brother-in-law," [...] she said. [...] "He has told me of your visit; and I am anxious <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of him. Do you like Mr. John Zant?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{eyes widened}} just a line, {{but they did}} not waver. [...] "I should like to hear from you," [...] she said cordially. [...] "I'd like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of those pamphlets, which I'll surely send." ...|$|E
50|$|Mr. Vice President, today our {{military}} forces are stretched thinner and {{doing more than}} they have ever done before during peacetime. I would like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> areâ€”I think we would all like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> as president would do to ensure proper resourcing for the current mission and/or more selectively choosing {{the time and place}} that our forces will be used around the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{are trying}} <b>to</b> do, Codfish?" [...] demanded Andy, using a {{nickname}} for Stowell which the latter abhorred.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't {{objections}} exactly. I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are doing; how {{you think}} this work of yours really does serve women." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Cynthy," [...] said Jeff, {{with the}} amorous resentment all gone from his voice. [...] "Sometimes folks outside notice the signs more--I don't mean that you're an outsider, {{as far as}} we're concerned--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two spoonfuls for me," [...] {{said the}} Countess, who, with Madame Merle, {{remained}} for some moments watching her. [...] "Listen to me, Pansy," [...] the Countess resumed at last. [...] "I should like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of your visitor." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked down}} at the tiller in his hands. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I should like to tell you about myself. I should like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the kind of man I am. Will you be honest if I will?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind about}} what Aunt Betsy {{remember}}s--she {{is not a}} witness; we only want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>YOU</b> remember yourself," [...] said the judge.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't {{mention his}} name, sir,' {{returned}} the locksmith, following his look towards Barnaby; 'I know HE saw him. I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>YOU</b> saw.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{are doing}} here---after my {{ordering}} you away {{last summer and}} last winter," [...] went on the lumber merchant, sourly.|$|R
60|$|So, I {{will change}} the subject to myself. You {{told me that you}} were going to read my book, and I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of it. If you were given to {{compliment}} and insincerity, I should be afraid of asking you; because, among other evident reasons, I might then appear to be asking for your praise instead of your opinion. As it is--I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of my book. Is the translation stiff? If you know me at all (and I venture to hope that you do) you will be certain that I shall like your honesty, and love you for being honest, even if you put on the very blackest of black caps....|$|E
6000|$|My 'Villon' is {{out this}} month; I should {{so much like}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of it. Stephen has written to me apropos of 'Idlers,' that {{something}} more in that vein would be agreeable to his views. [...] From Stephen I count that a devil of a lot.|$|E
6000|$|... "I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of Lucy Robarts?" [...] Lady Lufton became {{pale and}} frightened, {{and the blood}} ran cold to her heart. She had feared more than rejoiced in conceiving that her son was about to talk of love, but she had feared nothing so bad as this.|$|E
6000|$|... "How am I <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{feel for}} this man? It {{seems to me}} that you half hate him, half fear him, and {{sometimes}} despise him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{rise above}} detail, dear mother," [...] said Ralph. [...] "I should like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean <b>to</b> {{do with her}} in a general way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's not {{the literal}} meaning I am asking, sir," [...] said Lord Julian, with frosty dignity. [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> desire me <b>to</b> understand?" ...|$|R
60|$|THE BISHOP. So you shall, my dear, {{if you are}} lucky. But {{you know}} you neednt marry them all. Think of all the buttons {{you would have to}} sew on. Besides, nothing is more dreadful than a husband who keeps telling you {{everything}} he thinks, and always wants <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not at all}} {{surprised}} to hear this, Bolt; but what I want at present is <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> may be the precise position of the lugger, {{without the aid of}} the thermometer and of logarithms; I've a notion you would make out better by letting such things alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not, if he's in a {{difficult}} position? That's {{often the case with}} a man in love. I've been in love before, and I know. But never so much as this time--really never so much. I should like particularly <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of my prospects. I'm afraid that for Mr. Osmond I'm not--well, a real collector's piece." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The d---- he does!--I {{should like}} {{particularly}} well, Mr. Dodge, <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will find <b>to</b> say concerning this category {{in which the}} Montauk is placed." ...|$|R
6000|$|David gravely put up {{his hand}} and {{smoothed}} his ruffled locks, repeating, in his manful way, [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have left for the pig?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, my Lord,' impressively. 'I am hoping <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean <b>to</b> do {{for your}} dear brother's dear orphans,' and her {{handkerchief}} went up to her eyes.|$|R
60|$|Well, I wish, my friend, {{you would}} write me {{a word or}} two in answer to this, telling me your own ideas as to the proper issue out of these difficulties. I should like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> and what you suppose others will think, before I tell you my own notions about the matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the only}} thing I can do now, and it is useless to do that now. It will be no {{reparation}} for the past, and it will be for myself and not for her, as all that I {{have done in the past}} has been; but I wish <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of their getting married now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, boy," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have got}} a bit of news {{to tell you that}} will be {{pleasant}} to you. That's the first thing; and the next is, I want your advice. You are a sensible young chap, you are, although you are but a lad, and I should like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "First of all," [...] Quest replied, [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{have done}} with my assistant, the girl whom you carried off from the Professor's garage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You and Miss Howard seem <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{are talking}} about," [...] I {{observed}} coldly. [...] "Perhaps you don't realize that I am {{still in the}} dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gently, Kate," [...] he said, laying {{his hand}} upon hers; [...] "I don't want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> never WILL do, only <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have done. <b>What</b> was this falsehood?" ...|$|R
