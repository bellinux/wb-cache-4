25|$|Container cranes {{consist of}} a {{supporting}} framework that can traverse {{the length of a}} quay or yard on a rail track. Instead of a hook, they are equipped with a specialized handling tool called a spreader. The spreader can be lowered on top of a container and locks onto the container's four locking points ("corner castings") using a <b>twistlock</b> mechanism. Cranes normally transport a single container at once, but some newer cranes have the capability to pick up two to four 20-foot containers at once.|$|E
2500|$|About 90% of the world's {{containers}} {{are either}} nominal [...] or [...] long, although the United States and Canada also use longer units of , [...] and [...] ISO containers have castings with openings for <b>twistlock</b> fasteners {{at each of}} the eight corners, to allow gripping the box from above, below, or the side, and they can be stacked up to ten units high. Regional intermodal containers, such as European and U.S. domestic units however, are mainly transported by road and rail, and can frequently only be stacked up to three laden units high. Although the two ends are quite rigid, containers flex somewhat during transport.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>twistlocks</b> have {{built-in}} levers or mechanisms, while simpler versions require {{tools for}} installation or removal. Some <b>twistlocks</b> are permanently installed (e.g. on the decks of container ships {{or on the}} beds of tractor trailers), while others are temporarily installed and removed as needed (e.g. to stack containers in storage yards).|$|R

2500|$|In 1955 {{trucking}} magnate Malcom McLean bought Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, to form {{a container}} shipping enterprise, later known as Sea-Land. The first containers were supplied by Brown, where McLean met Keith Tantlinger, and hired him as vice-president of engineering and research. Under the supervision of Tantlinger, a new [...] x [...] x [...] Sea-Land container was developed, the length determined by the maximum length of trailers then allowed on Pennsylvanian highways. Each container had a frame with eight corner castings that could withstand stacking loads. Tantlinger also designed automatic spreaders for handling the containers, {{as well as the}} <b>twistlock</b> mechanism that connects with the corner castings.|$|E
2500|$|In 1955, former {{trucking}} company owner Malcom McLean {{worked with}} engineer Keith Tantlinger {{to develop the}} modern intermodal container. The challenge was to design a shipping container that could efficiently be loaded onto ships and would hold securely on long sea voyages. The result was a [...] tall by [...] wide box in -long units constructed from [...] thick corrugated steel. The design incorporated a <b>twistlock</b> mechanism atop {{each of the four}} corners, allowing the container to be easily secured and lifted using cranes. After helping McLean create the successful design, Tantlinger convinced him to give the patented designs to industry; this began international standardization of shipping containers.|$|E

25|$|The end of Bank Line's SA-15 class ships was {{not without}} incident. On 28 April 2009, on her last {{complete}} voyage in round-the-world service, Boularibank was attacked by Somalian pirates 120 miles northeast of Socotra Island {{at the entrance to}} the Gulf of Aden. Unable to outrun the attackers, Captain Peter Stapleton carried out evasive manoeuvres while under fire from the assailants' AK-47s and RPGs and had his crew ward off the invaders using water cannons, <b>twistlocks</b> and heavy balks of timber lashed to the guard rails. By the time a destroyer of the Russian Navy arrived at the scene the pirates had given up, leaving Boularibanks crew of 31, eleven passengers and the captain's wife unharmed. Stapleton was later awarded the Merchant Navy Medal for exceptional bravery during the attack.|$|R
50|$|Flatbeds became {{rare in the}} 1980s as the {{majority}} of road freight changed to either containers or pallet loads carried on larger and more efficient trucks, optimised for quicker loading by fork-lift trucks. Containers are carried on specialised semi-trailers with <b>twistlocks</b> in the corners to retain the container. Pallet loads are carried in either box bodies, loaded through rear doors, or curtain-sided bodies loaded through the sides. Both of these protect loads from the weather and can be quickly loaded with standard loads, but are more restrictive for single bulky loads, loaded by crane. The haulage and logistics business also changed {{around the same time}} as a greater proportion became more regular in nature, such as standard daily loads of equally-sized boxes from a distribution centre to a supermarket, rather than the unpredictable ad hoc nature or earlier road transport.|$|R

50|$|Though in the USA tank {{containers}} {{are typically}} the same dimensions (20 * 8 * 8.5 ft). {{as a standard}} ISO ocean container, tank chassis are much longer than the typical 20 ft container chassis. Tank chassis typically measure 40 - 43 ft in length by 8 x 4 ft wide x tall. This chassis has a standard drop-frame design providing a lower center of gravity than conventional trailers and an overall length suitable to legally scale most tanks. <b>Twistlocks</b> provide a secure mounting mechanism for the tanks and {{eliminate the need for}} straps or chains. The lower center of gravity is crucial for reducing the chances of a roll over with the constant shifting weight of the liquid cargo. These chassis can also be fitted with additional accessories including: lift kits to facilitate product discharge, hose tubes, and hi/lo kits to carry two empty tanks.|$|R
40|$|The company CrossControl {{develops}} display {{computers for}} control systems in industrial vehicles which operate in rough environments. Currently, {{the system can}} detect and diagnose different faults but CrossControl {{would also like to}} predict upcoming failures by using Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM). CBM is a cost effective maintenance strategy where the health condition of the system is monitored and maintenance is only performed after a degradation in performance has been observed. This thesis work aims to investigate the possibilities of implementing CBM on CrossControl's system by studying the theory behind CBM and associated methods and by analysing real data from the system of one of CrossControl's customers. The results presented in this thesis consist of two literature studies and one case study. The first literature study introduces different types of maintenance and gives a detailed explanation of CBM. The second literature study contains a collection of methods used to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the system, which is an important step in CBM. The case study considers the <b>twistlocks</b> of Bromma Conquip's spreader system and serves {{as an example of how}} CBM can be used in practise and exemplifies some difficulties that can be encountered when implementing CBM. Finally, a discussion of the obtained results and some suggestions for future work and ideas for how CBM can be implemented on CrossControl's system are given...|$|R

50|$|The {{female part}} of the {{connector}} is the 7 * 7 * 4+1/2 in corner casting, which is fitted to the container itself, and has no moving parts, only an oval hole in the bottom. The hole is an oval 4.9 in on the long axis with two flat sides 2.5 in apart. The male component is the <b>twistlock,</b> which is fitted to cranes and transport bases. This can be inserted through the hole (it is roughly 4.1 in long and 2.2 in wide), and then the top portion (normally pointed to make insertion easier) is rotated 90° so that it cannot be withdrawn. The mechanism {{is similar to that}} of a Kensington lock, but on a much larger scale. The maximum size and position of the holes in the connector is defined in international standard ISO 1161:1984. The tensile strength of a <b>twistlock</b> is rated at either 20 or 25 tonnes.|$|E
