5|$|Due to its sharp {{turns with}} {{restricted}} headroom, high-sided vehicles can only use the left-hand lane {{of the western}} tunnel, {{so it was not}} possible to reverse the <b>tidal</b> <b>flow</b> in the evening. On 20 April 2007 the morning <b>tidal</b> <b>flow</b> was discontinued, after reports by TfL and the Metropolitan Police (MPS) of an increase in dangerous motoring behaviour; these blamed poor driving, such as overtaking, for the decrease in safety during counterflow operations. The decision to end the counterflow was controversial, particularly as TfL and the MPS had been considering it since 2005, without properly informing affected borough councils, and an independent committee was set up to evaluate the decision. The ending of the counterflow system has brought protests from users of the tunnel and those experiencing increased congestion due to the change.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} owned and {{maintained}} by the Tamar Bridge and Torpoint Ferry Joint Committee, a conglomerate between Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. It has a main span of three lanes, which use a <b>tidal</b> <b>flow</b> arrangement to maximise traffic flow at rush hour, and two outer lanes. The north of these {{is used as a}} local access route from Saltash, while the south is used by cyclists and pedestrians, as it can no longer be used for vehicular traffic due to weight restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The stone {{packhorse}} bridge {{crosses the}} River Avill {{at the southern}} end of the village, below Dunster Castle at a point which may have been the limit of <b>tidal</b> <b>flow</b> during the medieval period. It was important for the transport of wool and other goods to the market within the village which was established by 1222. The name is derived from the nearby gallows. The narrow bridge is approach via a raised causeway for pedestrians, while wheeled traffic uses the adjacent ford.|$|E

Although the comparison of Saynisch et al. (2018) includes several baroclinic models, the induced magnetic field was still calculated from horizontal transports only.|$|R
5000|$|Low head {{hydropower}} applications use <b>tidal</b> <b>flows</b> or rivers {{with a head}} of 20 m or less {{to produce}} energy. [...] These applications may not need to dam or retain water to create hydraulic head. Using the drop in a river or <b>tidal</b> <b>flows</b> to create electricity may provide a renewable energy source {{that will have a}} minimal impact on the environment.|$|R
5|$|Because of its ongoing {{structural}} weaknesses, in 1957 the London County Council proposed {{replacing the}} Albert Bridge {{with a more}} conventional design. A protest campaign led by John Betjeman resulted in {{the withdrawal of the}} proposal, but serious concerns about the integrity of the bridge continued. In 1964 an experimental <b>tidal</b> <b>flow</b> scheme was introduced, in which only northbound traffic was permitted to use the bridge in the mornings and southbound traffic in the evenings. The bridge's condition continued to deteriorate however, and in 1970 the Greater London Council (GLC) sought and obtained consent to carry out strengthening work. In April 1972 the bridge was closed for the work to be carried out.|$|E
5|$|Since {{silicon nitride}} ball {{bearings}} are harder than metal, this reduces {{contact with the}} bearing track. This results in 80% less friction, 3 to 10 times longer lifetime, 80% higher speed, 60% less weight, the ability to operate with lubrication starvation, higher corrosion resistance and higher operation temperature, as compared to traditional metal bearings. Silicon nitride balls weigh 79% less than tungsten carbide balls. Silicon nitride ball bearings {{can be found in}} high end automotive bearings, industrial bearings, wind turbines, motorsports, bicycles, rollerblades and skateboards. Silicon nitride bearings are especially useful in applications where corrosion, electric or magnetic fields prohibit the use of metals. For example, in <b>tidal</b> <b>flow</b> meters, where seawater attack is a problem, or in electric field seekers.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} approach takes {{traffic from}} the A12 {{and the southern}} approach takes traffic from the A2, making the tunnel crossing a key link for both local and longer-distance traffic {{between the north and}} south sides of the river. It forms part of a key route into Central London from South East London and Kent and was the easternmost all-day crossing for vehicles before the opening of the Dartford Tunnel in 1963. It remains the easternmost free fixed road crossing of the Thames, and regularly suffers congestion, to the extent that <b>tidal</b> <b>flow</b> schemes were in place from 1978 until controversially removed in 2007. Proposals to solve the traffic problems have included building a third bore, constructing alternative crossings of the Thames such as the now cancelled Thames Gateway Bridge or the Silvertown Tunnel, and providing better traffic management, particularly for heavy goods vehicles.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to a model case study of the {{barotropic}} tidal dynamics. A non-hydrostatic (i. e. fully three dimensional) ocean model, based on the finite-element method was applied in the Strait of Messina (Italy), where intense <b>tidal</b> <b>flows</b> interact with complex geometries of coasts and bathymetry. A simplified model configuration including only the tidal signal at the open boundaries was able to provide evidences that the barotropic tides, interacting with coastlines and bottom topography in such narrow sea strait, generate high amplitude overtones of the main tidal constituents as well as relatively intense tide-induced residual circulations. The spatial and temporal distribution of <b>tidal</b> <b>flows</b> was analysed with a numerical simulation of a whole synodic month. The vertical component of <b>tidal</b> <b>flows,</b> explicitly computed, was shown in cross-sections in order to emphasized the direct effect of boundaries constraints on the vertical acceleration. The presented model results endorse previous model approaches and observations and they remind {{the significance of the}} barotropic tidal dynamics in this domain of investigatio...|$|R

25|$|In 2008, {{researchers}} tagged {{and recorded}} {{the movements of}} young bull sharks in the Caloosahatchee River estuary. Specifically, they were testing {{to find out what}} determined the movement of the young bull sharks. It was found that the young bull sharks synchronously moved downriver when the environmental conditions changed. This large movement of young bull sharks were found to be moving as a response rather than other external factors such as predators. An interesting find was that the movement was directly related to the bull shark conserving energy for itself. One way the bull shark is able to conserve energy is that when the <b>tidal</b> <b>flow</b> changes, the bull shark uses the <b>tidal</b> <b>flow</b> in order to conserve energy as it moves downriver. Another way for the bull shark to conserve energy is to decrease the amount of energy needed to osmoregulate the surrounding environment.|$|E
25|$|In 1776, Laplace {{formulated}} {{a single}} set of linear partial differential equations, for <b>tidal</b> <b>flow</b> {{described as a}} barotropic two-dimensional sheet flow. Coriolis effects are introduced as well as lateral forcing by gravity. Laplace obtained these equations by simplifying the fluid dynamic equations. But {{they can also be}} derived from energy integrals via Lagrange's equation.|$|E
25|$|Anglesey {{also has}} three wind farms on land, {{and more than}} twenty {{offshore}} wind turbines near the north coast. There are plans for the world's first <b>Tidal</b> <b>Flow</b> turbines, near The Skerries, off the north coast, and for a major biomass plant on Holy Island (Ynys Gybi). Developing such low-carbon energy assets to their full potential forms part of the Anglesey Energy Island project.|$|E
50|$|In {{physical}} oceanography, the {{sublittoral zone}} refers to coastal regions with significant <b>tidal</b> <b>flows</b> and energy dissipation, including non-linear flows, internal waves, river outflows and ocean fronts.As in marine biology, this zone typically {{extends to the}} edge of the continental shelf.|$|R

25|$|Given respite by the Union strategy, the Confederate Army {{improved}} the defenses of Mobile Bay by strengthening Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines {{at the entrance}} to the bay. In addition, they set up Fort Powell, a smaller work that guarded the Grant's Pass channel. Grant's Pass was also obstructed by a set of piles and other impediments, which had the effect of diverting the <b>tidal</b> <b>flow</b> to Heron Pass.|$|E
25|$|The River Roach {{is part of}} the River Crouch and Roach {{tidal river}} system which {{includes}} all of the creeks around Wallasea Island, Foulness Island, Potton Island, New England Island, Havengore Island and Rushley Island. The <b>tidal</b> <b>flow</b> around the creeks between those latter islands considerably affects the tides in the River Roach. Those creeks and tidal flows also enhance the River Roach's habitat and conditions for oyster cultivation and fish spawning.|$|E
25|$|Wave power, which {{captures the}} energy of ocean surface waves, and tidal power, {{converting}} {{the energy of}} tides, are two forms of hydropower with future potential; however, they are not yet widely employed commercially. A demonstration project operated by the Ocean Renewable Power Company {{on the coast of}} Maine, and connected to the grid, harnesses tidal power from the Bay of Fundy, location of world's highest <b>tidal</b> <b>flow.</b> Ocean thermal energy conversion, which uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer surface waters, has currently no economic feasibility.|$|E
50|$|Three {{miles off}} the coast, there is a {{parallel}} ridge under the sea rising to within 15 m of the surface. The <b>tidal</b> <b>flows</b> along the Channel, forced {{between it and the}} island, have carved out a deep channel known as 'St. Catherine's Deep'.|$|R

500|$|Tidal power uses {{generators}} {{to produce}} electricity from <b>tidal</b> <b>flows,</b> sometimes {{by using a}} dam to store and then release seawater.

25|$|The lake is {{connected}} to the sea via three tunnels that lie near the surface. The tunnels channel tidal water {{in and out of the}} lake. Tide levels in the lake are damped to about a third of the lagoon tidal levels. The tidal peaks are delayed from the lagoon tidal peaks by about 1 hour and forty minutes. Biologist William Hamner estimated that about 2.5% of the lake's volume is exchanged during a <b>tidal</b> <b>flow.</b> However, because the tidal water enters at the surface, the lower anoxic layer is largely unaffected by tidal flows.|$|E
25|$|Coastal salt marshes can be {{distinguished}} from terrestrial habitats by the daily <b>tidal</b> <b>flow</b> that occurs and continuously floods the area. It is an important process in delivering sediments, nutrients and plant water supply to the marsh. At higher elevations in the upper marsh zone, there is much less tidal inflow, resulting in lower salinity levels. Soil salinity in the lower marsh zone is fairly constant due to everyday annual <b>tidal</b> <b>flow.</b> However, in the upper marsh, variability in salinity is shown {{as a result of}} less frequent flooding and climate variations. Rainfall can reduce salinity and evapotranspiration can increase levels during dry periods. As a result, there are microhabitats populated by different species of flora and fauna dependant on their physiological abilities. The flora of a salt marsh is differentiated into levels according to the plants' individual tolerance of salinity and water table levels. Vegetation found at the water must be able to survive high salt concentrations, periodical submersion, and a certain amount of water movement, while plants further inland in the marsh can sometimes experience dry, low-nutrient conditions. It has been found that the upper marsh zones limit species through competition and the lack of habitat protection, while lower marsh zones are determined through the ability of plants to tolerate physiological stresses such as salinity, water submergence and low oxygen levels.|$|E
25|$|By 1980, a {{restoration}} programme {{was put in}} place that has now been running for over 20 years. This programme has aimed to reconnect the marshes by returning <b>tidal</b> <b>flow</b> along with the ecological functions and characteristics of the marshes back to their original state. In the case of Barn Island, declines in the invasive species have initiated, re-establishing the tidal-marsh vegetation along with animal species such as fish and insects. This example highlights that considerable time and effort is needed to effectively restore salt marsh systems. Times in marsh recovery can depend on the development stage of the marsh; type and extent of the disturbance; geographical location; and the environmental and physiological stress factors to the marsh-associated flora and fauna.|$|E
