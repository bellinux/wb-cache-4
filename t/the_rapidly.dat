5|$|An early {{focus of}} the new {{authority}} was on policing and crime, with {{construction of a new}} borough prison begun in 1842. The Leeds Improvement Act of 1842 gave the council further powers over markets, streets, street lighting, sewerage, building regulations, public cleansing and smoke regulation in <b>the</b> <b>rapidly</b> growing industrial city.|$|E

5|$|Polyploidy {{appears to}} have {{enhanced}} the ability of flowering plants to survive the extinction, probably because the additional copies of the genome such plants possessed, allowed them to more readily adapt to <b>the</b> <b>rapidly</b> changing environmental conditions that followed the impact.|$|E

5|$|As {{the police}} chase <b>the</b> <b>rapidly</b> {{transforming}} Carroon across London, Quatermass analyses {{samples of the}} mutated creature in a laboratory, and realises that it {{has the ability to}} end all life on Earth if it spores. A television crew working on an architectural programme locates the monster in Westminster Abbey, and Quatermass and troops of the British Army rush in to destroy it in the hour before it brings about doomsday. Quatermass convinces the consciousness of the three crewmen buried deep inside the creature to turn against it and destroy it; this appeal to the last remains of their humanity succeeds in defeating the organism.|$|E
5|$|At its root, {{the peasant}} war of 1653 {{was caused by}} <b>the</b> <b>rapidly</b> {{changing}} economic circumstances {{after the end of}} the Thirty Years' War. The Swiss Confederacy had been spared from all belligerent action; the Swiss peasants generally had profited from the wartime economy as they had been able to export their agrarian products at higher prices than before. After the Peace of Westphalia, the southern German economy recovered quickly, the Swiss exports dwindled, and the prices for agrarian products dropped. Many Swiss peasants, who had raised mortgages during the boom at wartime, suddenly faced financial problems.|$|E

5|$|By the 1890s, the {{observatory}} had become crowded by <b>the</b> <b>rapidly</b> growing university. Electrification of the tramways along College Street {{just to the}} south, and the large quantities of metal used in the modern buildings surrounding the site threw off the instruments. A new magnetic observatory opened in 1898 in Agincourt, at that time largely empty fields, leaving the downtown campus location with its meteorological and solar observation duties.|$|E
5|$|Compounding {{these issues}} was the one-year {{rotation}} policy {{adopted by the}} Pentagon in Southeast Asia. Although the first aircrews arriving in-theater were highly experienced, <b>the</b> <b>rapidly</b> growing tempo and ever-expanding length of the operation demanded more personnel. This exacerbated a growing lack of experienced aircrews. This dilemma was further compounded by an Air Force policy which dictated universal pilot training while proscribing involuntary second combat tours, which combined, {{had the effect of}} rotating personnel to different aircraft. Conversely, the Navy tended to maintain its aircrews within the same community for the duration of their careers, thereby retaining their expertise, but also incurring greater losses among experienced crews undergoing multiple combat tours.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{finally began}} upon the battlecruisers in 1920 and 1921, after a delay of almost five months. However, that July, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes {{called for a}} conference in Washington D.C. to be held that November. The stated goal was to curb <b>the</b> <b>rapidly</b> growing and {{extremely}} expensive naval construction programs. It was obvious to the General Board that the expensive new battlecruisers, which some thought were already obsolete, would be very attractive targets for cancellation. Accordingly, studies were done exploring the possibilities of converting {{one or more of}} the battlecruisers to different uses: one looked at a conversion to an aircraft carrier, while another contemplated a conversion to an Atlantic ocean liner.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the rapid}} pace of operations, deployment, and redeployment, {{coordination}} of artillery units and their fires became a worrisome quandary during the operations. This was made even more problematic by the confusion generated {{by the lack of}} adequate communications systems between <b>the</b> <b>rapidly</b> advancing units. The joint nature of the operation added another level of complexity to the already overstretched communications network. Regardless, due to the ability of U.S. logisticians to innovate and improvise, supplies of food, water, ammunition, and spare parts arrived at their destinations without any shortages hampering combat operations and the communications system, although complicated, functioned well enough during the short duration of U.S. operations.|$|E
5|$|During the game, Quickdraw must {{locate the}} wanted outlaws one by one. Once an outlaw {{has been found}} and shot (shooting the outlaw does not kill him, but only initiates a duel), the game shifts to the first-person {{targeting}} minigame. This time, the player must shoot <b>the</b> <b>rapidly</b> moving outlaw as quickly as possible. The player can either wait for the outlaw to draw, or take the initiative and shoot first, which will make the bandit draw his weapon as well. If the player successfully shoots an outlaw, a bounty is paid (increasing with every round), and a new outlaw enters the town.|$|E
5|$|In 1549 a {{grammar school}} was opened (closing again in 1739), and in 1561 Skagen's first {{lighthouse}} was constructed. In 1568, some 350 fishing boats and merchant ships were wrecked {{off the coast}} of Skagen. In the 1590s, successive storms led not only to numerous drownings but to flooding, destroying many of the houses. In 1591, 22 died in a flood and in 1593, 14 houses were washed away. In 1595, 25 farms in the area were covered in drifting sand. As a result, new housing was built in Østerby to the north east, away from <b>the</b> <b>rapidly</b> accumulating sand.|$|E

5|$|In 1932 {{the line}} to Upminster was {{electrified}} and new vehicles were purchased. After the District Railway became part of London Underground, similar cars were ordered to allow the Metropolitan line be extended to Barking and replace some of <b>the</b> <b>rapidly</b> deteriorating original wooden trailers. The 1935–40 New Works Programme fitted electro-pneumatic brakes and air-operated doors {{to most of the}} District line stock and allowed the remaining wooden cars to be scrapped. A number of motor cars were not suitable for conversion and so some trains retained their hand-worked doors and these ran until 1957.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Norway {{entered a}} {{cooperation}} with the United States, {{which resulted in the}} construction of the Norwegian Space Centre at Andøya. In 1964, ESRO was established as a Western European reaction to <b>the</b> <b>rapidly</b> developing Soviet and American space programs. Norway chose to only join as an observer, partially because of the close {{cooperation with the}} US and partially because of the cost. However, Norwegian space research scientists participated in ESRO programs.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, the ESRB {{introduced}} a streamlined, automated process for assigning ratings for console downloadable {{games as a}} way to address <b>the</b> <b>rapidly</b> growing volume of digitally-delivered games. Rather than having raters review each product, publishers of these games complete a series of multiple-choice questions that address content across relevant categories, including violence, sexual content, language, etc. The responses automatically determine the game's rating category and content descriptors. Games rated via this process may be tested post-release to ensure that content was properly disclosed. The survey-based method is also used in the ESRB/CTIA and IARC rating programs for mobile apps.|$|E

He proposed tangible steps to recover <b>the</b> <b>rapidly</b> deteriorating relationship between Washington and Khartoum. In March 1996, El Fatih Erwa, then minister of state for defense, was authorized by President Omar al-Bashir to make several secret trips to the United States to hold talks with U.S. officials, including Carney and senior C.I.A. Africa experts, about U.S. sanctions policy against Sudan and what measures might be taken by the Bashir regime to lift them.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the UN advances, China's Chairman, Mao Zedong, ordered the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier Force to enter North Korea and engage UN forces under the name People's Volunteer Army (PVA). In order to stabilize <b>the</b> <b>rapidly</b> collapsing Korean front and to push back the advancing UN forces, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a bridgehead-building operation {{with the aim of}} destroying the ROK II Corps, the vanguard and the right flank of the US Eighth Army, advancing up along the Taebaek Mountains {{in the middle of the}} peninsula. After the Chinese leadership finally settled the issue of armed intervention on October 18, Mao ordered the PVA to enter Korea on October 19 under strict secrecy.|$|E
