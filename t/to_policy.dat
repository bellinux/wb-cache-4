He subsequently {{took part in the}} Aitape–Wewak campaign, commanding a platoon {{until the end of the}} war. Due to the discriminatory laws in force at the time, Saunders had fewer rights as a citizen than the white Australians he led. He was wounded in the knee by Japanese gunfire during fighting around Maprik, and was hospitalised for three weeks as a result.|$|E

5|$|By a {{day after}} the storm made landfall, the record power outages were largely restored. However, salt damage {{prevented}} restoration in some areas for several days. The outages left residents temporarily without water after water pumps were shut down. In Hiroshima, lack of power caused traffic congestion, shut down banks, and disrupted hospitals. The widespread power outages related to Mireille prompted the government to reconstruct transmission towers with anemometer, or wind measurement devices. Following the storm, insurance companies paid $6billion <b>to</b> <b>policy</b> holders in Japan, which was a world record related to wind damage; this was surpassed {{less than a year later}} by Hurricane Andrew striking Florida. The typhoon still holds the title as the costliest non-Atlantic hurricane.|$|E

5|$|In 1976 Lucas wrote a paper criticizing {{large-scale}} Keynesian models {{used for}} forecasting and policy evaluation. Lucas argued that economic models based on empirical relationships between variables are unstable as policies change: a relationship under one policy regime may be invalid after the regime changes. The Lucas's critique went further {{and argued that}} a policy's impact is determined by how the policy alters the expectations of economic agents. No model is stable unless it accounts for expectations and how expectations relate <b>to</b> <b>policy.</b> New classical economists argued that abandoning the disequilibrium models of Keynesianism and focusing on structure- and behavior-based equilibrium models would remedy these faults. Keynesian economists responded by building models with microfoundations grounded in stable theoretical relationships.|$|E

His death attracted international attention, including {{a statement from the}} United Nations and multiple rewards for information on the case. In Costa Rica, his death led to calls for reform of environmental policy. On June 4, the government met with environmentalists to discuss potential changes <b>to</b> <b>policy.</b> A plan submitted by environmentalists and endorsed by Environment Minister René Castro would set up a new protected area and grant park rangers more authority to stop poachers, among other changes. On June 5, vigils were held across Costa Rica in honor of Mora. On June 18, the government announced the allocation of ₡20 million (US$40,000), which was later upped to ₡30 million (US$60,000), to memorialize Mora.|$|E
5|$|The Linguistic Society of America (LSA) is {{a learned}} {{society for the}} field of linguistics.

The Society publishes two scholarly journals, Language and the open access journal Semantics and Pragmatics. Its annual meetings, held every winter, foster discussion amongst its members through the presentation of peer-reviewed research, as well as conducting official business of the Society. Since 1928, the LSA has offered training to linguists through courses held at its biennial Linguistic Institutes held in the summer. The LSA and its 3,500 members work to raise awareness of linguistic issues with the public and contributes <b>to</b> <b>policy</b> debates on issues including bilingual education and the preservation of endangered languages.|$|E

5|$|Members of the British mission {{occupied}} {{several key}} {{positions in the}} electromagnetic project. Oliphant became Lawrence's de facto deputy, and {{was in charge of}} the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory when Lawrence was absent. His enthusiasm for the electromagnetic project was rivalled only by Lawrence's, and his involvement went beyond scientific problems, extending <b>to</b> <b>policy</b> questions such as whether to expand the electromagnetic plant, although in this he was unsuccessful. The British chemists made important contributions, particularly Harry Emeléus and Philip Baxter, a chemist who had been research manager at ICI, was sent to the Manhattan Project's Clinton Engineering Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in 1944 in response to a request for assistance with uranium chemistry, and became personal assistant to the general manager. His status as an ICI employee was of no concern to Groves. The British mission was given complete access to the electromagnetic project, both in Berkeley and at the Y-12 electromagnetic separation plant in Oak Ridge. While some of the British mission remained at Berkeley or Oak Ridge only for a few weeks, most stayed until the end of the war. Oliphant returned to Britain in March 1945, and was replaced as head of the British mission in Berkeley by Massey.|$|E

We apply this new approach <b>to</b> <b>policies</b> restricting calls <b>to</b> methods in Java applications.
