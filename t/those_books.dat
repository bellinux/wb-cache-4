5|$|Herbals {{contributed to}} botany by setting in train {{the science of}} plant description, classification, and botanical illustration. Up to the 17th century botany and {{medicine}} were {{one and the same}} but <b>those</b> <b>books</b> emphasising medicinal aspects eventually omitted the plant lore to become modern pharmacopoeias; those that omitted the medicine became more botanical and evolved into the modern compilations of plant descriptions we call Floras. These were often backed by specimens deposited in a herbarium which was a collection of dried plants that verified the plant descriptions given in the Floras. The transition from herbal to Flora marked the final separation of botany from medicine.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Jasienica (then, Leon Beynar) {{fought in}} the Polish Army, and later, the Home Army resistance. Near {{the end of the}} war, he was also working with the anti-Soviet resistance, which later led to him taking up a new name, Paweł Jasienica, to hide from the {{communist}} government of the People's Republic of Poland. He was associated with the Tygodnik Powszechny weekly and several other newspapers and magazines. He {{is best known for his}} 1960s books on Polish historyon the Kingdom of Poland under the Piast Dynasty, the Jagiellon Dynasty, and the elected kings of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. <b>Those</b> <b>books,</b> still popular, played an important role in popularizing Polish history among several generations of readers.|$|E
5|$|Following the war's end, only 400 {{out of the}} library's nearly 3,000 volumes {{could be}} recovered, with only 200 of <b>those</b> <b>books</b> {{remaining}} on the library's shelves. Between 10 and 20 of the library's recovered volumes only contained three to four of their original books. The value of the recovered volumes was degraded, as many were damaged or broken. The society members that returned home to Romney were too war-weary to revive the society when they discovered {{the ruins of the}} Romney Classical Institute and its library, which had been an expensive endeavor to accumulate and took almost a half-century of labor to amass.

5|$|From August 1953, Montalban ceased {{working for}} London Life, {{publishing}} {{her work in}} the magazine Prediction, one of the country's best-selling esoteric-themed publications. Starting with a series on the uses of the tarot, in May 1960 she was employed to produce a regular astrological column for Prediction. Supplementing such esoteric endeavours, she penned a series of romantic short stories for publication in magazines. Throughout the 1950s she released a series of booklets under different pseudonyms that were devoted to astrology; in one case, she published the same booklet under two separate titles and names, as Madeline Montalban's Your Stars and Love and Madeline Alvarez's Love and the Stars. She never wrote any books, instead preferring the shorter booklets and articles as mediums through which to propagate her views, and was critical of <b>those</b> <b>books</b> that taught the reader how to perform their own horoscopes, believing that they put professional astrologers out of business.|$|E
5|$|On November 6, 2013, Disney Consumer Products began {{releasing}} {{a line of}} merchandise featuring Anna in Disney Store and other retailers. Various versions of Anna dolls include the fashion doll set, the mini-doll set, plush doll, Anna-as-a-toddler doll, and a special version called Musical Magic Elsa and Anna Dolls, which lights up and plays their signature songs that appear in the film when users hold their hands or they hold each other's hands. Anna's merchandise also covers {{a wide range of}} other products, such as rolling luggage, boots, clothes, nightgowns, bowls, plates, coffee mugs, and home décors. In addition, the film was adapted as simplified storybooks for children, with diverse versions featuring sound effects, original character voices, and mini projectors that project movie images on the wall. One of <b>those</b> <b>books,</b> called A Sister More Like Me, includes illustrations by Brittney Lee, the film's visual development artist. Both Anna and Elsa appear as playable characters in Disney Infinity through the use of their corresponding figurines.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{literature}} faced {{a similar}} fate in territories annexed by Germany, where the sale of Polish books was forbidden. The public destruction of Polish books {{was not limited to}} those seized from libraries, but also included <b>those</b> <b>books</b> that were confiscated from private homes. The last Polish book titles not already proscribed were withdrawn in 1943; even Polish prayer books were confiscated. Soon after the occupation began, most libraries were closed; in Kraków, about 80% of the libraries were closed immediately, while the remainder saw their collections decimated by censors. The occupying powers destroyed Polish book collections, including the Sejm and Senate Library, the Przedziecki Estate Library, the Zamoyski Estate Library, the Central Military Library, and the Rapperswil Collection. In 1941, the last remaining Polish public library in the German-occupied territories was closed in Warsaw. During the war, Warsaw libraries lost about a million volumes, or 30% of their collections. More than 80% of these losses were the direct result of purges rather than wartime conflict. Overall, it is estimated that about 10million volumes from state-owned libraries and institutions perished during the war.|$|E

40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out of all 8856 births {{occurring}} at home in England and Wales in 1979. Of these births, 67 % had been booked for delivery at home, 21 % had been booked for delivery in hospital, 3 % had not been booked, and for 9 % the intended place of delivery was unknown. The perinatal mortality varied almost 50 -fold according to the intended place of delivery, ranging from 4. 1 / 1000 births in <b>those</b> <b>booked</b> for delivery at home to 196. 6 / 1000 unbooked births. Deliveries that occurred at home but had been booked for a hospital consultant unit were associated with a perinatal mortality of 67. 5 / 1000. Births that had been booked for delivery at home included the smallest proportion of babies of low birth weight: 2. 5 % weighed 2500 g or less compared with 18 % of <b>those</b> <b>booked</b> for consultant units and 29 % of <b>those</b> not <b>booked.</b> Within these low birthweight groups there were noticeable differences in perinatal mortality; births booked to occur at home had the lowest mortality and unbooked births had the highest. Perinatal mortality among babies who weighed more than 2500 g was generally low irrespective of the intended place of delivery; the only exception was in babies whose delivery had not been booked. In all groups perinatal mortality was considerably higher in nulliparous than parous women. Women booking a delivery at home are clearly a selected group, and some may have been transferred to hospital during labour and were thus {{not included in the}} survey. Nevertheless, these data suggest that the perinatal mortality among births booked to occur at home is low, especially for parous women...|$|R
