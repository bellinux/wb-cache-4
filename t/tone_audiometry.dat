40|$|Abstract- This {{randomized}} {{clinical trial}} aimed {{to assess the}} efficacy of phlebotomy on improvement of hearing loss. 71 patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss were enrolled in this randomized clinical trial study. They {{were divided into two}} groups: group A received steroid and hydration therapy plus phlebotomy, while group B received the same regimen without phlebotomy. They were matched according to sex, age, Hb, and Htc. Pure <b>tone</b> <b>audiometries</b> were administered to examine the hearing levels before and after treatment. Statistical analysis showed higher improvement in 250 - 1000 Hz in patients whit phlebotomy (P< 0. 001). However, there was noticed no significant difference in hearing improvement in 2000 - 8000 Hz between two methods. The number (%) of patients who had improvement was 29 (85. 3 %) in phlebotomy group and 21 (56. 8 %) in non-phlebotomy group. On the other hand, the number (%) of patients who showed no im-provement in A and B group was 5 (14. 7 %) and 16 (43. 2 %), respectively (P= 0. 008). Using phlebotomy ac-companied by steroid and hydration therapy leads to higher improvement in hearing loss especially in 250 - 1000 Hz.

40|$|SummaryAlport Syndrome (AS) is a {{hereditary}} disease, {{characterized by}} nephropathy, often times with {{sensorineural hearing loss}} and ocular defects. Aim: to analyze the clinical and hearing information from individuals with AS, more specifically the correlation between renal disorder and hearing loss (HL). Study design: clinical prospective with cross-sectional cohort. Materials and Methods: 37 individuals underwent otorhinolaryngological evaluation and were submitted to audiologic tests. For HL statistical analysis we considered only {{the results from the}} pure <b>tone</b> <b>audiometries.</b> Results: of the 28 individuals with clinical alterations, we found 46. 4 % of DLX and 53. 6 % of AD. HL happened to 46. 1 % of the individuals evaluated. 12 patients presented HL in the audiometric test: 11. 5 % mild and 34. 6 % moderate. Comparing the normal relatives with those with renal disorder; all that had HL also had renal disorder. In 30. 8 % the curve shape was mild descending in the high frequencies and in 11. 5 % it was flat. Conclusions: The inheritance pattern distribution does not match literature descriptions. HL is a frequent extra-renal finding. There is an association between renal involvement and HL (p= 0. 009). The most frequent curve shapes: mild descending in the high frequencies and flat. There was no association between HL and age. There is no correlation between the HL and gender in this group...|$|R
50|$|Identification of {{sensorineural hearing}} loss is usually made by {{performing}} a pure <b>tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> (an audiogram) in which bone conduction thresholds are measured. Tympanometry and speech audiometry may be helpful. Testing is performed by an audiologist.|$|E
50|$|An {{audiogram}} is {{the result}} of a hearing test. The most common type of hearing test is pure <b>tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> (PTA). It charts the thresholds of hearing sensitivity at a selection of standard frequencies between 250 and 8000 Hz. There is also high frequency pure <b>tone</b> <b>audiometry</b> which tests frequencies from 8000-20,000 Hz. PTA can be used to differentiate between conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss and mixed hearing loss. A hearing loss can be described by its degree i.e. mild, moderate, severe or profound, or by its shape i.e. high frequency or sloping, low frequency or rising, notched, U-shaped or 'cookie-bite', peaked or flat.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the reliability of}} the Bone Conduction-HeadBand (BC-HB) test for predicting the postoperative functional outcome of a round-window (RW) vibroplasty. Study Design: Within-subject comparison of the functional results of the BC-HB test, which is routinely used for the preoperative evaluation of a bone-conduction transducer, with an active middle ear implant (AMEI) placed onto the round window. Setting: Tertiary referral university hospital center. Patients: Seven patients with similar anatomic (absent stapes superstructure) and functional (moderate, mixed hearing loss) sequelae from open tympanoplasty technique. Intervention: All subjects underwent preoperative audiologic assessment with the BC-HB. Subsequently, all subjects underwent surgical placement of an AMEI onto the round window. Main Outcome Measure: Pure <b>tone</b> and speech <b>audiometry</b> in quiet and noise were assessed. Additionally, evaluation of specific satisfactory targets was performed using the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement. Results: Pure <b>tone</b> and speech <b>audiometry</b> in quiet established that both devices had very similar performance and provided remarkable improvement compared with the unaided condition. However, high-frequency gain and speech audiometry in noise demonstrated better performance with RW-AMEI. Conclusion: In patients presenting with mixed hearing loss as a sequela from middle ear surgery, the preoperative BC-HB test may be helpful in predicting the final functional outcome and patient satisfaction with RW-AMEI...|$|R

Results: The results revealed that 68. 4 % of infants presented one or more episodes of middle ear effusion during their two first years, with more recurrence among males. Peak occurrence was between four and 12 months of age and, the earlier the first episode, the higher the probability of recurrence. Greatest incidence was during May and August. It was found that, of the variables investigated, the period of exclusive breastfeeding actuated as a protector factor. With respect of risk factors, it was observed that passive smoking, gastro-esophageal reflux and respiratory allergy were related with the recurrences of effusion. Conclusion: Findings revealed the importance of periodic auditory follow-up for infants during their first two years of life, considered to be the critical period of auditory system maturation, during which sensory deprivation can be responsible for damage to the development of speech, language and other auditory abilities.

40|$|A {{subclinical}} viral labyrinthitis {{has been}} postulated {{in the literature}} to elicit Idiopathic Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss. An etiological role for the herpes virus family is assumed. Corticosteroids possess a limited beneficial effect on hearing recovery in ISSHL. In this study, the therapeutic value of the antiherpetic drug aciclovir (Zovirax(R)) on hearing recovery in 44 ISSHL patients receiving prednisolone is evaluated in a multicentre clinical trial. The study is designed prospectively, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled. Subjective parameters include hearing recovery, a pressure sensation on the affected ear, disequilibrium or vertigo and tinnitus. Audiometric parameters include pure <b>tone</b> and speech <b>audiometry.</b> A one-year follow up is obtained. Both the pressure sensation and disequilibrium or vertigo have a good prognosis, but tinnitus, occurring in most patients, has a poor prognosis.

40|$|Labyrinthitis with vestibulocochlear {{dysfunction}} {{in chronic}} inflammatory bowl {{disease is a}} rare but well described manifestation or complication. The diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities and limitations of this inflammatory otopathy are presented and discussed {{in the context of}} a case report. A bilateral loss of vestibular function and sensorineural hearing loss occurred in a 26 -year-old male patient with previously diagnosed Crohn's disease. He was treated with immune suppressive therapy during the onset and development of cochleovestibular symptoms. Diagnostic tests included pure <b>tone</b> audiograms, speech <b>audiometry,</b> caloric tests, VEMPs, and MRI. Therapy included azathioprine, corticosteroids (systemic and intratympanic), monoclonal antibodies, and cochlear implants. Despite immunosuppressive therapy including monoclonal antibodies, the patient progressively lost his hearing. Finally, bilateral cochlear implantation was carried out with good results.
