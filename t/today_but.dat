5|$|However, poison {{still exists}} as a murderous entity <b>today,</b> <b>but</b> {{it is not}} as popular form of {{conducting}} murder {{as it used to be}} in past times, probably because of the wider range of ways to kill people and other factors that must be taken into consideration.

5|$|The levels found {{today in}} {{most people are}} orders of {{magnitude}} greater than those of pre-industrial society. Due to reductions of lead in products and the workplace, acute lead poisoning is rare in most countries <b>today,</b> <b>but</b> low level lead exposure is still common.

During the end of the 20th century, the blood lead levels deemed acceptable steadily declined. Blood lead levels once considered safe are now considered hazardous, with no known safe threshold.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} GE invention by Tracy Hall {{uses the}} belt press wherein {{the upper and}} lower anvils supply the pressure load to a cylindrical inner cell. This internal pressure is confined radially by a belt of pre-stressed steel bands. The anvils also serve as electrodes providing electric current to the compressed cell. A variation of the belt press uses hydraulic pressure, rather than steel belts, to confine the internal pressure. Belt presses are still used <b>today,</b> <b>but</b> they are built on a much larger scale than those of the original design.|$|E

40|$|Etruria, {{homeland}} of the Etruscans, lies on {{the western}} coast of Italy {{to the north of}} Rome between the Tiber and the Arno rivers. This hilly region is defined by its low-lying coast and the rugged Apennine mountains to the north and east. Since the Etruscan period the sea level is little changed but there has been significant soil erosion modifying the hills and valleys. The climate in the Etruscan period was similar to <b>today's</b> <b>but</b> human action has modified the vegetation cover. To conclude, the major landscape zones of Etruria are briefly described...|$|R
50|$|The Holocene {{climatic optimum}} (HCO) {{was a period}} of warming in which the global climate became warmer. However, the warming was {{probably}} not uniform across the world. This period of warmth ended about 5,500 years ago with the descent into the Neoglacial and concomitant Neopluvial. At that time, the climate was not unlike <b>today's,</b> <b>but</b> there was a slightly warmer period from the 10th-14th centuries known as the Medieval Warm Period. This was followed by the Little Ice Age, from the 13th or 14th century to the mid-19th century, which {{was a period of}} cooling.|$|R

5|$|A part-savoury, part-sweet pasty (similar to the Bedfordshire clanger) was {{eaten by}} miners in the 19th century, in the copper mines on Parys Mountain, Anglesey. The {{technician}} {{who did the}} research and discovered the recipe claimed that the recipe was probably taken to Anglesey by Cornish miners travelling to the area looking for work. No two-course pasties are commercially produced in Cornwall <b>today,</b> <b>but</b> are usually the product of amateur cooks. They are, however, commercially available in the British supermarket chain Morrisons (under the name 'Tin Miner Pasty'). Other traditional fillings have included {{a wide variety of}} locally available meats including pork, bacon, egg, rabbit, chicken, mackerel and sweet fillings such as dates, apples, jam and sweetened rice - leading to the oft-quoted joke that 'the Devil hisself was afeared to cross over into Cornwall for fear that ee'd end up in a pasty'.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the {{behaviour}} of Newton's parakeet, but it is probable that it was similar to that of other members of its genus. Leguat mentioned that the parrots of the island ate the nuts of the bois d'olive tree (Cassine orientalis). Tafforet also stated that the parrots ate the seeds of the bois de buis shrub (Fernelia buxifolia), which is endangered <b>today,</b> <b>but</b> was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit. Newton's parakeet may have fed on leaves as the related echo parakeet does. The fact that it survived long after Rodrigues had been heavily deforested shows that its ecology was less vulnerable than that of, for example, the Rodrigues parrot.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the bridge}} {{remained}} in service for another 21 {{years as a}} free crossing, the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission constructed a brand new bridge at the Portland-Columbia. The new toll bridge was constructed in 1953 for $4 million (1953 USD, equal to $ <b>today),</b> <b>but</b> the toll was only one quarter (equal to $ today), like the former price of the Darlington's Bridge. Darlington, who had retired from his job in Orange in 1950, was alive and was in disbelief. The next April, the Toll Bridge Commission went ahead and dismantled the bridge made useful by Darlington, which was fought by several legal actions. The bridge ceased operations on April 3, 1954, being demolished soon after. The covered bridge at Columbia was destroyed during Hurricane Diane the next August. Just before the demolishing of the Darlington's Bridge, the approach on the New Jersey side had been renumbered to State Highway Route 163, which remains in condition from when the bridge was in use.|$|E

5|$|During the Ice Age a vast, {{cold and}} dry mammoth steppe {{stretched}} from the Arctic islands southwards to China, and from Spain eastwards across Eurasia {{and over the}} Bering land bridge into Alaska and the Yukon, where it was blocked by the Wisconsin glaciation. The land bridge existed because sea levels were lower due to more of the planet's water being locked up in glaciers compared with today. Therefore, {{the flora and fauna}} of Beringia were more related to those of Eurasia rather than to those of North America. In eastern Beringia from 35,000 YBP the northern Arctic areas experienced temperatures 1.5°C (2.7°F) warmer than <b>today,</b> <b>but</b> the southern sub-Arctic regions were 2°C (3.5°F) cooler. In 22,000YBP, during the Last Glacial Maximum, the average summer temperature was 3-5°C (5.4-9°F) cooler than today, with variations of 2.9°C (5.2°F) cooler on the Seward Peninsula to 7.5°C (13.5°F) cooler in the Yukon.|$|E
5|$|Heavier {{suburban}} {{traffic on the}} Melbourne network saw a greater strain on the block working then used, which required {{a large number of}} manned signal boxes to enable trains to run close together. As a result, it was decided to adopt power signalling under the Automatic Block System (ABS) of safeworking, where the presence of trains automatically control the signals after them, providing a safe distance between trains. Introduced from 1915, the system was based on American speed signalling practice with GRS2A upper quadrant mechanical signals with two arms able to indicate up to 5 different speed aspects to train drivers. These signals were later replaced by colour light signals which are the standard <b>today,</b> <b>but</b> the old mechanical style remained until 2001.|$|E
5|$|His most {{significant}} influence was {{the introduction of}} the idea of wild gardening, which first appeared in The Wild Garden and was further developed in The English Flower Garden. The idea of introducing large drifts of native hardy perennial plants into meadow, woodand, and waterside is taken for granted <b>today,</b> <b>but</b> was revolutionary in Robinson's time. In the first edition, he happily used any plant that could be naturalised, including half-hardy perennials and natives {{from other parts of the}} world—thus Robinson's wild garden was not limited to locally native species. Robinson's own garden at Gravetye was planted on a large scale, but his wild garden idea could be realised in small yards, where the 'garden' is designed to appear to merge into the surrounding woodland or meadow. Robinson's ideas continue to influence gardeners and landscape architects today—from home and cottage gardens to large estate and public gardens.|$|E

5|$|Negative {{pressure}} {{is believed to}} be a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does <b>today,</b> <b>but</b> its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant.|$|E
5|$|The {{intersection}} of 7th Street NW and H Street NW {{is the heart}} of D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood <b>today,</b> <b>but</b> prior to the 1930s it was populated primarily by German immigrants. Before the American Civil War, 7th Street NW was the city's primary commercial district, the street lined with three-story Federal-style townhouses with shops on the ground floor and residences above. Lincoln conspirator Mary Surratt's boarding house (604 H Street NW) has been substantially renovated through the years (and currently houses a Chinese restaurant), but it may also house Mary Surratt's ghost. From the 1870s onward, occupants of the building have claimed that Surratt's spirit is responsible for the incomprehensible mumbling and whispers, footsteps, muffled sobs, and creaking floorboards which have unnerved them.|$|E
5|$|The village {{changed little}} in either {{character}} or structure {{after the end}} of World War II, though in 1965 plans were drawn for the further development of Durham Road which drew criticism from residents.
