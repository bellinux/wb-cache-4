40|$|I {{study the}} {{properties}} of optimal long-term contracts in {{an environment in which}} the <b>agent.</b> <b>s</b> type evolves stochastically over time. The model stylizes a buyer-seller relationship but the results apply quite naturally to many contractual situations including regulation and optimal income-taxation. I. rst show, through a simple example, that distortions need not vanish over time and need not be monotonic in the shock to <b>the</b> <b>buyer.</b> <b>s</b> valuation. These results are in contrast to those obtained in the literature that assumes a Markov process with a binary state space. e. g. Battaglini, 2005. I then show that when the sets of possible types in any two adja-cent periods satisfy a certain overlapping condition (which is always satis. ed with a continuum of types), then the dynamics of the optimal mechanism can be signi. cantly simpli. ed by as-suming the shocks are independent over time. Under certain regularity conditions, the optimal mechanism is then the same irrespective of whether the shocks are <b>the</b> <b>buyer.</b> <b>s</b> private informa-tion or are observed also by the seller. These conditions are satis. ed, for example, {{in the case of an}} AR(1) process, a Brownian motion, but also when shocks have a multiplicative e as it is often the case in. nancial applications. Furthermore, the distortions in the optimal quantities are independent of the distributions of the shocks and, when <b>the</b> <b>buyer.</b> <b>s</b> valuation is additively separable, they are also independent of whether the shocks are transitory or permanent. Finally, I show that assuming the shocks are independent not only greatly simpli. es the analysis but is actually without loss of generality with a continuum of types...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{coordination}} of order and production policy between buyers and suppliers in supply chains. When a buyer and a supplier of an item work independently, <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> will place orders based on his economic order quantity (EOQ). However, <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> EOQ may not lead to an optimal policy for the supplier. It can be shown that a cooperative batching policy can reduce total cost significantly. Should <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> have <b>the</b> more powerful position to enforce his EOQ on the supplier, then no incentive exists for him to deviate from his EOQ in order to choose a cooperative batching policy. To provide an incentive to order in quantities suitable to the supplier, the supplier could offer a side payment. One critical assumption made throughout in the literature dealing with incentive schemes to influence <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> ordering policy is that the supplier has complete information regarding <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> cost structure. However, this assumption is far from realistic. As a consequence, <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> has no incentive to report truthfully on his cost structure. Moreover there is an incentive to overstate the total relevant cost in order to obtain as high a side payment as possible. This paper provides a bargaining model with asymmetric information about <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> cost structure assuming that <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> has <b>the</b> bargaining power to enforce his EOQ on the supplier in case of a break-down in negotiations. An algorithm for the determination of an optimal set of contracts which are specifically designed for different cost structures of <b>the</b> <b>buyer,</b> assumed by <b>the</b> supplier, will be presented. This algorithm was implemented in a software application, that supports the supplier in determining the optimal set of contracts...|$|R

Recalling that <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> must also incur a per unit switching cost of k if he decides to switch to supplier 2, we see that <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> will switch suppliers if k + d (d 1) < d 1.

40|$|Abstract: Despite its {{importance}} for international trade, our under-standing of the matching process between importing and exporting firms remains limited. To {{shed light on}} this question, I use confidential U. S. customs data to match firm-level information of Indian manu-facturing exporters from the CMIE-Prowess database with firm-level information of their U. S. importers from the Census Longitudinal Busi-ness Database. I develop a model of sequential production in which buyers (importers) engage in costly search for suppliers (exporters) to control a production stage and optimally decide the amount of investment in search. The model shows that the marginal benefit of assigning a high-capability supplier to a given stage increases with the downstreamness of the stage of production, and relatively more when the final product is less differentiated. Focusing on firm size {{as a proxy for}} firm capability, the matched data highlights three key facts that are consistent with the model predictions and are robust to different em-pirical strategies. First, there is positive assortative matching between U. <b>S.</b> <b>buyers</b> and their Indian suppliers. The elasticity of average buyer size with respect to Indian firm size is around 0. 2. Second, the strength of positive matching increases with the proximity to final use of the product traded (downstreamness). The magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> size elasticity is 0. 5 when Indian firms supply final products to U. S. firms, and close to zero when they supply intermediate products. Finally, matching is stronger- and more sensitive to downstreamness- when the demand elasticity faced by <b>the</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>buyer</b> is high...|$|R
