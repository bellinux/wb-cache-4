5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> {{mushroom}} {{species that}} are harvested from the wild for personal consumption or commercial sale. Milk mushrooms, morels, chanterelles, truffles, black trumpets, and porcini mushrooms (Boletus edulis) (also known as king boletes) demand a high price on the market. They are often used in gourmet dishes.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> {{citizens}} {{who live in}} areas corresponding to classes 1–3 than {{those who live in}} the areas corresponding to classes 5 and 6. For example, in Bogotá 73% of the population live in zones of classes 1–3, whereas only 10% live in zones classified as 5 and 6. Consequently, the tariff system permanently causes deficits which require subsidies paid by the national government.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> {{people with}} Scottish ancestry living abroad {{than the total}} {{population}} of Scotland. In the 2000 Census, 9.2million Americans self-reported some degree of Scottish descent. Ulster's Protestant population is mainly of lowland Scottish descent, and it is estimated that there are more than 27million descendants of the Scots-Irish migration now living in the US. In Canada, the Scottish-Canadian community accounts for 4.7million people. About 20% of the original European settler population of New Zealand came from Scotland.|$|E

5|$|This {{decision}} {{allowed for}} the naming of Makemake and Haumea, and their formal recognition as plutoids and dwarf planets, bringing the number of IAU-accepted plutoids to four. However, the (co)discoverer of Eris, Makemake, and Haumea, Mike Brown, estimates that between 100 and 400 known bodies are plutoids, and that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> {{that have yet to}} be discovered.

5|$|A {{total of}} 202 {{different}} birds {{have been recorded}} on the island. Eighteen species of land birds breed {{on the island and}} <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> migratory species that occur on the island and its adjacent islets, many tame enough that it is possible for humans to get quite close. The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Endemic Bird Area, and the Permanent Park Preserve as an Important Bird Area, because it supports the entire population of Lord Howe woodhens, most of the breeding population of providence petrels, over 1% of the world population of another five seabird species, and the whole populations of three endemic subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Access and {{movement}} within the protected areas is restricted. In the lake area in particular, no motorized boats are permitted.

5|$|According to the 2000 census by INEGI, Nahuatl {{is spoken}} by an {{estimated}} 1.45million people, some 198,000 (14.9%) {{of whom are}} monolingual. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> female than male monolinguals, and females represent nearly {{two thirds of the}} total number. The states of Guerrero and Hidalgo have the highest rates of monolingual Nahuatl speakers relative to the total Nahuatl speaking population, at 24.2% and 22.6%, respectively. For most other states the percentage of monolinguals among the speakers is less than 5%. This means that in most states more than 95% of the Nahuatl speaking population are bilingual in Spanish.|$|E

As such, performing a WHOIS query on a domain requires knowing the correct, authoritative WHOIS server to use. Tools to do WHOIS proxy searches have become common.|$|R
