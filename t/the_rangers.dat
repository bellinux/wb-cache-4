5|$|Although {{no longer}} a Rangers employee, Smythe was invited to the Rangers' opening game in Madison Square Garden by Tex Rickard, an {{invitation}} he nearly turned down because he had felt <b>the</b> <b>Rangers</b> had short-changed him. Hammond paid Smythe $7,500 to settle his contract, and Smythe felt he was owed $10,000. At the insistence of his wife Irene, they traveled to New York and attended the opener in Rickard's private box. When <b>the</b> <b>Rangers</b> won the game, surprising the Montreal Maroons, Rickard offered Smythe a vice-presidency with the club. Smythe turned <b>the</b> <b>Rangers</b> down, {{partly because of the}} disputed $2,500, although Rickard ordered Hammond to pay off the rest. On the return trip to Toronto, Conn and Irene visited Montreal, where Smythe bet the $2,500 on a football game between Toronto and McGill. He then bet the $5,000 he won on <b>the</b> <b>Rangers</b> to defeat the St. Pats in Toronto, winning again, turning the $2,500 into $10,000 in three days. <b>The</b> <b>Rangers</b> won the Stanley Cup in 1928, their second year of existence, largely with the players Smythe had brought to the team.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00, {{troops of}} the Chinese 39th Army began a frontal assault on Hill 205, {{signaled}} by drums and whistles. An estimated platoon-sized force of Chinese made the first attack. <b>The</b> <b>Rangers</b> fought back with heavy small arms fire and several pre-sighted artillery concentrations, repulsing this first attack at 22:50. A number of Rangers were wounded in this attack, including Puckett, who refused evacuation. At 23:00 the Chinese launched a second attack which was quickly repelled, as was a third attack several minutes later. Both of these attacks were an estimated company in strength. <b>The</b> <b>Rangers</b> inflicted heavy casualties each time {{as a result of}} a well-established defensive perimeter, though the platoon of tanks at the foot of the hill opposite the Chinese attack were unable to assist <b>the</b> <b>Rangers,</b> as the crews had no experience in night operations. By 23:50 the Chinese began attacking in greater numbers, with an estimated two companies advancing at a time, moving to within hand grenade range. <b>The</b> <b>Rangers</b> began to run low on ammunition while their casualties continued to mount, and Puckett was wounded again. Over the course of several hours the Chinese launched a fourth and a fifth attack, each of which was narrowly pushed back by <b>the</b> <b>Rangers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Rangers</b> were then ordered to fix bayonets in preparation for the next attack.|$|E

5|$|Chinese troops counterattacked {{in force}} at 23:00, with two battalions of {{infantry}} supported by snipers and mortar fire. Aided by 7th Division artillery fire, <b>the</b> <b>Rangers</b> held the hill against Chinese resistance. <b>The</b> <b>Rangers</b> repulsed four successive Chinese assaults {{by one of}} the battalions, expending all of their grenades by 02:00 on 18 May, and running short on ammunition by 03:00. At that point, the second Chinese battalion commenced its assault, surprising <b>the</b> <b>Rangers</b> and driving them from the peak of Hill 581. Queen counterattacked and retook the hill by 05:00. At 06:45, the Chinese gave up the attack, having been severely mauled. In the unsuccessful attempt to take Hill 581, Chinese losses amounted to at least 120 killed and several hundred injured. <b>The</b> <b>Rangers,</b> having relied on tight interlocking crossfire and well dug-in positions, suffered only 10 wounded in the battle.
