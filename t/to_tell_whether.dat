5|$|Finally, {{other species}} are {{encountered}} only accidentally, or so rarely in Canadian territory {{that it is}} impossible <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> they are permanent resident. Most of these species are cetaceans, some generally poorly known: Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), the dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sima and K. breviceps), Blainville's and True's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris and M. mirus), the false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), and the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). The big free-tailed and evening bats (respectively Nyctinomops macrotis and Nycticeius humeralis), as well as the New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) are found mostly in areas south of the U.S.-Canada frontier, and occasionally in Canada.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, it is {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> a trait has been lost and then re-evolved convergently, or whether a gene has simply been switched off and then re-enabled later. Such a re-emerged trait is called an atavism. From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene (selectively neutral) has a steadily decreasing probability of retaining potential functionality over time. The time scale of this process varies greatly in different phylogenies; in mammals and birds, there is a reasonable probability of remaining in the genome in a potentially functional state for around 6 million years.|$|E

5|$|Ancient {{sources tell}} several {{different}} stories about Orion; {{there are two}} major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in Boeotia, his visit to Chios where he met Merope and after he violated her, was blinded by her father, Oenopion, the recovery of his sight at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became Scorpio, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.|$|E
5|$|At 07:00 on 4 August, {{while the}} French {{squadron}} was cruising off the Brazilian coast, lookouts sighted sails on the horizon. Uncertain {{of the identity}} of the strange ships, the French gradually closed the distance during the morning. Landolphe could see that there were seven large vessels and three smaller ships, all unmistakably British. He was unable however <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> they were naval ships of the line or East Indiamen. Initially he thought they might be merchant ships, but at noon he sighted double rows of gunports along the side of each ship and called off the attack, turning away and signalling for his squadron to split up, believing the enemy to be large warships easily capable of destroying his small force. Captain Jurien protested Landolphe's order, insisting that the convoy was composed of merchant ships and not warships, but Landolphe over-ruled Jurien's protests. In fact, Jurien was correct.|$|E
5|$|Development of the {{sandwich}} began in 2001 {{in response to}} several major factors. After an overall sales decline of 17% coupled with a profit decline of 29%, Burger King {{held a series of}} consumer tests that showed the company's customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases. Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain. Furthermore, the company was seeking to counter the threat to its sales by newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into sales. By July 2002, the chain had sold nearly fifty million of {{the sandwich}}es, eventually displacing the BK Broiler's initial launch figures as the company's best selling product introduction. The successful introduction of the Chicken Whopper {{was one of the few}} noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its owner Diageo to a group of investors led by the TPG Capital; Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. president Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, but he said it's too early <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> the changes have been successful. Despite the Chicken Whopper's initial success, just over a year after the Chicken Whopper's introduction enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King's largest franchisee, Carrols Corporation, was complaining that the product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name. As of November 2013, the Chicken Whopper is the current grilled chicken sandwich sold by Burger King in the Middle East.|$|E

25|$|As with König's paradox, {{this paradox}} cannot be formalized in axiomatic set theory because it {{requires}} the ability <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> a description applies to a particular set (or, equivalently, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> a formula is actually {{the definition of a}} single set).|$|E

25|$|After {{the human}} and {{chimpanzee}} genomes were sequenced and compared, it was usually impossible <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> differences {{were the result of}} the human or chimpanzee gene changing from the common ancestor.

25|$|By {{looking at}} a {{cylindrical}} rod can one tell whether it is twisted? If the rod is perfectly cylindrical, then the circular symmetry of the cross section makes it impossible <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> {{or not it is}} twisted. However, if there were a straight line drawn {{along the length of the}} rod, then one could easily say whether or not there is a twist by looking at the state of the line. Drawing a line is gauge fixing. Drawing the line spoils the gauge symmetry, i.e., the circular symmetry U(1) of the cross section at each point of the rod. The line is the equivalent of a gauge function; it need not be straight. Almost any line is a valid gauge fixing, i.e., there is a large gauge freedom. <b>To</b> <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> the rod is twisted, you need to first know the gauge. Physical quantities, such as the energy of the torsion, do not depend on the gauge, i.e., are gauge invariant.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} {{environmental}} education that exists in Honduras is minimal, so {{it is difficult to}} protect these endangered species. The widespread poverty and lack of accurate research on the ecosystems makes protection increasingly difficult. While the conservation programs are reaching their goals, it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> or not the management plans are successfully protecting these species directly. Protecting the ecosystems, like the rainforest, upon which the endangered species depend serves as an important indirect benefit.|$|E

25|$|In theory, {{when exercising}} {{judicial}} review of administrative action, the Court's task is only {{to ensure that the}} decision in question was made according to the law. Even though it may disagree with the decision, it will not substitute its own decision for that of the decision-maker. In practice, however, it is sometimes difficult <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> the Court is applying that principle. The branch of law dealing with this facet of the Court's jurisdiction is administrative law.|$|E
25|$|For any finitely {{presented}} group {{it is easy}} {{to construct}} a (smooth) compact 4-manifold with it as its fundamental group. As there is no algorithm <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> two finitely presented groups are isomorphic (even if one is known to be trivial) there is no algorithm to tell if two 4-manifolds have the same fundamental group. This is one reason why much of the work on 4-manifolds just considers the simply connected case: the general case of many problems is already known to be intractable.|$|E

25|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} are common among children with ASD, {{although there are}} no firm data. Symptoms include generalized anxiety and separation anxiety, and are likely affected by age, level of cognitive functioning, degree of social impairment, and ASD-specific difficulties. Many anxiety disorders, such as social phobia, are not commonly diagnosed in people with ASD because such symptoms are better explained by ASD itself, and it is often difficult <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> symptoms such as compulsive checking are part of ASD or a co-occurring anxiety problem. The prevalence of anxiety disorders in children with ASD has been reported to be anywhere between 11% and 84%.|$|E
25|$|In modern cricket, the {{two lines}} usually aimed for by fast bowlers is the {{so-called}} corridor of uncertainty, the area just outside the batsman's off stump, or actually on the stumps. It is difficult for the batsman <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> or not such a ball is likely to strike their wicket, and thus to know whether to attack, defend or leave the ball. This technique was historically known as off theory (contrast leg theory), but it is now so routine that it is rarely given a name at all, or forgotten about completely. Of course, variation in line is also important and deliveries aimed at the leg stump can also serve a purpose.|$|E
25|$|The next psychic {{claimed to}} be able to read auras around people. He claimed that auras were visible at least five inches above each of them. He {{selected}} ten people who he said had clearly visible auras.

He was <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> or not a person was standing behind each screen, by seeing their aura above. Since random guessing would be expected to get about five correct, the psychic needed to get eight of the ten right. The psychic stated that he saw an aura over all ten screens, but people were behind only four of the screens.|$|E
