In the first instance, the photographer or videographer removes the camera lens while photographing or recording and overloads the image sensor.

Such applications still retain restrictions on range and power: while forcefields of many cubic kilometres are possible (and in fact, orbitals are {{held together by}} forcefields), even in the chronologically later novels, such as Look to Windward, spaceships are still used for long-distance travel and drones for many remote activities.|$|E

The reasons for these errors can include time limitations, being unfamiliar with a technique, or misjudging weather conditions, all frequently encountered by people in survival situations.

25|$|In many {{countries}} {{it is now}} a requirement by law to build fish ladders into the design of a weir that ensures that fish can bypass the barrier and access upstream habitat. Unlike dams, weirs do not usually prevent downstream fish migration (as water flows over the top and allows fish to bypass the structure), although <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>create</b> flow conditions that injure juvenile fish..

25|$|When the kernel has an {{appropriate}} device driver in place, it can then access {{the contents of}} the disk drive in raw format, which may contain one or more file systems. A file system driver is used to translate the commands used to access each specific file system into a standard set of commands that the operating system can use to talk to all file systems. Programs can then deal with these file systems on the basis of filenames, and directories/folders, contained within a hierarchical structure. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>create,</b> delete, open, and close files, as well as gather various information about them, including access permissions, size, free space, and creation and modification dates.|$|E
25|$|Violet rings {{have several}} unique abilities. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>create</b> {{crystals}} {{which can be}} used to imprison members of other Lantern Corps on Zamaron. Over time, the rings of the prisoners trapped in stasis within the crystals are infected with violet energy. After spending enough time inside, the prisoner will emerge as a Star Sapphire. The rings can also detect when a love is in jeopardy, locate it, and then create a connection to the embattled heart that {{can be used as a}} tether. Sapphires are also shown as being able to show others their greatest love. Unlike constructs created by Green Lanterns, Orange Lanterns cannot absorb those made by Star Sapphires. Star Sapphires appear to be able to teleport in order to escape attackers, while their energy constructs release a disorienting dust when destroyed. These two abilities can be combined effectively to avoid being pursued. Violet power rings have the ability to restore the recently deceased to life by drawing power from the heart of one that loves them.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} act of the film taking place on the planet Krypton, Weta Digital placed alien-like planet environments, creatures and the {{principal}} means of display—a technology the filmmakers called [...] "liquid geometry". Weta Digital visual effects supervisor Dan Lemmon explained that, [...] "It’s a bunch of silver beads that are suspended through a magnetic field, and the machine is able to control that magnetic field so that the collection of beads behave almost like three-dimensional pixels, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>create</b> a surface that floats {{in the air and}} describes whatever the thing is you’re supposed to be seeing."

500|$|Gust fronts create {{low-level}} {{wind shear}} {{which can be}} hazardous to planes when they takeoff or land. [...] Flying insects are swept along by the prevailing winds. [...] As such, fine line patterns within weather radar imagery, associated with converging winds, are dominated by insect returns. [...] At the surface, clouds of dust can be raised by outflow boundaries. If squall lines form over arid regions, a duststorm known as a haboob can result from the high winds picking up dust in their wake from the desert floor. [...] If outflow boundaries move into areas of the atmosphere which are stable in the low levels, such as over colder pockets of ocean or through the cold sector of extratropical cyclones, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>create</b> a phenomenon known as an undular bore, which shows up on satellite and radar imagery {{as a series of}} transverse waves in the cloud field oriented perpendicular to the low-level winds.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Ronald Oxburgh {{suggested}} in The Courier-Mail that production of biofuels could be either responsible or irresponsible and had several trade-offs: [...] "Produced responsibly {{they are a}} sustainable energy source that need not divert any land from growing food nor damage the environment; they can also help {{solve the problems of}} the waste generated by Western society; and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>create</b> jobs for the poor where previously were none. [...] Produced irresponsibly, they at best offer no climate benefit and, at worst, have detrimental social and environmental consequences. [...] In other words, biofuels are pretty much like any other product. [...] In 2008 the Nobel prize-winning chemist Paul J. Crutzen published findings that the release of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in the production of biofuels means that they contribute more to global warming than the fossil fuels they replace.O release from agro-biofuel production negates global warming reduction by replacing fossil fuels ...|$|E

2500|$|Visual Studio allows {{developers}} to write extensions for Visual Studio {{to extend its}} capabilities. These extensions [...] "plug into" [...] Visual Studio and extend its functionality. Extensions {{come in the form}} of macros, add-ins, and packages. Macros represent repeatable tasks and actions that developers can record programmatically for saving, replaying, and distributing. Macros, however, cannot implement new commands or create tool windows. They are written using Visual Basic and are not compiled. Add-Ins provide access to the Visual Studio object model and can interact with the IDE tools. Add-Ins can be used to implement new functionality and can add new tool windows. Add-Ins are plugged into the IDE via COM and can be created in any COM-compliant languages. Packages are created using the Visual Studio SDK and provide the highest level of extensibility. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>create</b> designers and other tools, as well as integrate other programming languages. The Visual Studio SDK provides unmanaged APIs as well as a managed API to accomplish these tasks. However, the managed API isn't as comprehensive as the unmanaged one. Extensions are supported in the Standard (and higher) versions of Visual Studio 2005. Express Editions do not support hosting extensions.|$|E
