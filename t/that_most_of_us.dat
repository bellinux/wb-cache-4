25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor {{to a lot of}} us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I knew something was wrong, because Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But I kept thinking of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E
500|$|In August 1999, McCain's memoir Faith of My Fathers, co-authored with Mark Salter, was published; a {{reviewer}} {{observed that}} its appearance [...] "seems {{to have been}} timed to the unfolding Presidential campaign." [...] The most successful of his writings, it received positive reviews, became a bestseller, and was later made into a TV film. The book traces McCain's family background and childhood, covers his time at Annapolis and his service {{before and during the}} Vietnam War, concluding with his release from captivity in 1973. According to one reviewer, it describes [...] "the kind of challenges <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can barely imagine. It's a fascinating history of a remarkable military family." ...|$|E
500|$|Both Jim Uttley of Indian Life Newspaper and Pastor Jamie Bagley of The News of Cumberland County called Nefarious [...] "hard-hitting". Uttley further {{asserted}} that Nefarious [...] "is {{not an easy}} film to watch because it deals with a subject <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would rather ignore", {{and he went on}} to highly recommend the film. Jimmy Stewart of Charisma reported that the film gives a human face to trafficking statistics and instils a desire in the viewer {{to put an end to}} such criminal activity. Ted Baehr of Movieguide, a Christian magazine, called the film [...] "a powerful, compelling and transformational documentary about human trafficking and sex slavery" [...] and wrote that it was amazing that the film covered an inherently sexual topic both honestly and without nudity. Baehr praised the cinematography, editing, and filmmaking, but criticized some portions of the film as being repetitive and uncompelling. The Movieguide review ends by comparing the film's opposition to modern slavery to the death of Saint Telemachus, which put an end to gladiatorial games in ancient Rome. Erica Yunghans of Star News Daily called the film [...] "controversial".|$|E

500|$|Sir John Deed (played by Martin Shaw) is a {{recently}} appointed High Court judge who actively seeks {{justice in the}} cases before him, {{while at the same}} time trying to rekindle an old romance with former pupil Jo Mills QC (played by Jenny Seagrove), who regularly appears in his court. Deed is described by creator and writer G.F. Newman as a character who [...] "speaks out against all the petty rules and bureaucracy that frustrates us all but <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> don't speak out against". Because of Deed's unorthodox actions, he is often hampered in his pursuit of justice by several more conventional-minded characters, including his ex-wife, barrister Georgina [...] "George" [...] Channing QC (played by Caroline Langrishe); her father Appeals Court Judge, Lord Justice (Sir Joseph) Channing (played by Sir Donald Sinden), fellow High Court Judges Mr Justice (Sir Monty) Everard (played by Simon Ward) and Mr Justice (Sir Michael) Niven (played by Trevor Bowen), the Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Department (LCD, later Department of Constitutional Affairs) Sir Ian Rochester (played by Simon Chandler); and later the Home Secretary Neil Haughton MP (played by Nick Reding and later Aneirin Hughes).|$|E
500|$|At the BFI London Film Festival, Nagy {{said she}} titled the film Carol, not The Price of Salt, because Highsmith herself {{had changed the}} title to Carol when the novel was republished, and she also [...] "liked the sort of strange, obsessive nature of calling it by someone's name." [...] There were later other discussions with Haynes. Haynes said that the film is called Carol because the novel [...] "is locked into the {{subjectivity}} of the younger woman" [...] and Carol is [...] "really the object of desire in the story." [...] "There's an element of, something aloof ... something unsettled about , that puts Therese and these new feelings ... on edge {{throughout much of the}} film. That relationship of who's the object and who's the subject does shift in the story, but it made sense ultimately that that would be the name for the film." [...] On the universal theme of the story, Haynes said [...] "the real determining question is not whether society will accept [...] feelings or not; it's, will this person return her love or not? ... That is what transcends the class of love, or the period in which it's occurring, and makes it something that just humbles us all and levels us all in the throes of those experiences <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} one of the few in the series that has no paranormal {{elements}} to it. Carter said of the episode's conception, [...] "My first chance to work with David Nutter in a long time, and I wanted to give him something he could sink his teeth into. It's a little bit different for us. It doesn't really have a paranormal aspect, except for Scully's perceptions of her deepest fears. I felt that I had to figure out what she is most afraid of, and she is most afraid of those things <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are afraid of. [...] The idea of dying at the hands of someone—creature or not—and she is helpless to do anything about it. I thought it was a very good way to explore Scully's character." [...] The scene where Dana Scully imagines Pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real-life accounts, as described by Carter: [...] "There are reports of people who had been under the spell of Jeffrey Dahmer, who actually claimed that he shape-shifted during those hours when they were held hostage; that his image actually changed." [...] Nutter said [...] "In many ways, Chris wanted to sell the idea that, as established in Mulder's closing dialogue in the show, not all terror comes from the paranormal. It could come from the person next door." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{the poem}} was defended {{by a few}} critics, E. C. Pettet {{returned}} to {{the argument that the}} poem lacked a structure and emphasized the word [...] "forlorn" [...] as evidence of his view. In his 1957 work, Pettet did praise the poem as he declared, [...] "The Ode to a Nightingale has a special interest in <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would probably regard it as the most richly representative of all Keats’s poems. Two reasons for this quality are immediately apparent: there is its matchless evocation of that late spring and early summer season [...] and there is its exceptional degree of 'distillation', of concentrated recollection". David Perkins felt the need to defend {{the use of the word}} [...] "forlorn" [...] and claimed that it described the feeling from the impossibility of not being able to live in the world of the imagination. When praising the poem in 1959, Perkins claimed, [...] "Although the [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] ranges more widely than the [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn," [...] the poem can also be regarded as the exploration or testing out of a symbol, and, compared with the urn as a symbol, the nightingale would seem to have both limitations and advantages." [...] Walter Jackson Bate also made a similar defense of the word [...] "forlorn" [...] by claiming that the world described by describing the impossibility of reaching that land. When describing the poem compared to the rest of English poetry, Bate argued in 1963, [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] is among [...] "the greatest lyrics in English" [...] and the only one written with such speed: [...] "We are free to doubt whether any poem in English of comparable length and quality has been composed so quickly." [...] In 1968, Robert Gittins stated, [...] "It may not be wrong to regard [...] as Keats's earlier essays in this [...] form, and the great Nightingale and Grecian Urn as his more finished and later works." ...|$|E
500|$|Moral anti-realists {{debate whether}} the moral facts {{necessary}} to activate conscience supervene on natural facts with a posteriori necessity; or arise a priori because moral facts have a primary intension and naturally identical worlds may be presumed morally identical. It {{has also been}} argued {{that there is a}} measure of moral luck in how circumstances create the obstacles which conscience must overcome to apply moral principles or human rights and that with the benefit of enforceable property rights and the rule of law, access to universal health care plus the absence of high adult and infant mortality from conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and famine, people in relatively prosperous developed countries have been spared pangs of conscience associated with the physical necessity to steal scraps of food, bribe tax inspectors or police officers, and commit murder in guerrilla wars against corrupt government forces or rebel armies. Scrutton has claimed that true understanding of conscience and its relationship with morality has been hampered by an [...] "impetuous" [...] belief that philosophical questions are solved through the analysis of language in an area where clarity threatens vested interests. Susan Sontag similarly argued that it was a symptom of psychological immaturity not to recognise that many morally immature people willingly experience a form of delight, in some an erotic breaking of taboo, when witnessing violence, suffering and pain being inflicted on others. Jonathan Glover wrote <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> [...] "do not spend our lives on endless landscape gardening of our self" [...] and our conscience is likely shaped not so much by heroic struggles, as by choice of partner, friends and job, as well as where we choose to live. Garrett Hardin in a famous article called tragedy of the commons argued that any instance in which society appeals to an individual exploiting a commons to restrain himself or herself for the general good-by means of his or her conscience- merely sets up a system which, by selectively diverting societal power and physical resources to those lacking in conscience, while fostering guilt (including anxiety about his or her individual contribution to over-population) in people acting upon it, actually works toward the elimination of conscience from the race.|$|E
2500|$|Parsons has {{estimated}} that he auditioned for between 15 and 30 television pilots, but {{on many of the}} occasions when he was cast, the show failed to find a television network willing to purchase it. The exception came with The Big Bang Theory. After reading the pilot script, Parsons felt that the role of Sheldon Cooper would be a very good fit for him. Although he did not feel any sort of relationship with the character, he was enchanted by the dialogue structure, the way the writers [...] "brilliantly use those words <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> don't recognize to create that rhythm. And the rhythm got me. It was the chance to dance through that dialogue, and {{in a lot of ways}} still is." ...|$|E

500|$|Rediff {{considered}} {{the film to}} be a [...] "beautiful and tragic love story".

2500|$|In {{addition}} Diana Fuss (1991) explains, [...] "the {{problem of}} {{course with the}} inside/outside rhetoric...is that such polemics disguise the fact <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are {{both inside and outside}} at the same time". Further, [...] "To be out, in common gay parlance, is precisely to be no longer out; to be out is to be finally outside of exteriority and all the exclusions and deprivations such outsiderhood imposes. Or, put another way, to be out is really to be in—inside the realm of the visible, the speakable, the culturally intelligible." [...] In other words, coming out constructs the closet it supposedly destroys and the self it supposedly reveals, [...] "the first appearance of the homosexual as a 'species' rather than a 'temporary aberration' also marks the moment of the homosexual's disappearance—into the closet".|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Jesse Katz, {{a former}} Los Angeles Times reporter, {{said of the}} LA Times coverage: [...] "As an L.A.

We had this huge team of people at the L.A. Times and kind of piled on to one lone muckraker up in Northern California." [...] And [...] "we really didn't do anything to advance his work or illuminate much to the story, and it was a really kind of tawdry exercise. ... And it ruined that reporter's career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of the freed {{passengers}} {{claimed that}} Iran had aided the hijackers by providing weapons and explosives while {{the plane was}} at Mashhad Airport. Kuwaiti security officer Khaled Nasser Zaferi said that several more men boarded the plane after landing in Iran. [...] "They produced a submachine gun and explosives they didn't have before. They were disguised as cleaning workers, but their performance was so bad and unprofessional <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> whispered to each other, 'These must be Iranian security men.' [...] " [...] Passengers said the hijackers wiped surfaces clean of fingerprints, and removed other identifying evidence from the aircraft before the siege ended, while pilot Captain Subhi Yousif told reporters he had been unaware of {{the deaths of the}} two Kuwaiti men until his release.|$|E

Moody closes by stating that the song is intended to inspire and that if you play your hand right, you might still come out on top.|$|R
3000|$|The muzzle blast (MB) is {{the sound}} <b>that</b> {{probably}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> associate with a gun shot, the [...] "bang."

2500|$|When {{coming out}} is {{described}} as a gradual process or a journey, it is meant to include becoming aware of and acknowledging one's same-sex desires or gender identity. This preliminary stage, which involves soul-searching or a personal epiphany, is often called [...] "coming out to oneself" [...] and constitutes the start of self-acceptance. Many LGBT people say that this stage began for them during adolescence or childhood, when they first became aware of their sexual orientation toward members of the same sex. Coming out has also been described as a process because of a recurring need or desire to come out in new situations in which LGBT people are assumed to be heterosexual or cisgender, such as at a new job or with new acquaintances. As Diana Fuss (1991) explains, [...] "the problem of course with the inside/outside rhetoric...is that such polemics disguise the fact <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are both inside and outside at the same time".|$|E
