5|$|In the lead-up to Blizzard's {{official}} {{announcement of}} the playable character, the developers teased his release by modifying the Doomfist gauntlet in Numbani <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stolen from its glass case. Blizzard finally confirmed the Doomfist's development with a teaser trailer in early July 2017, a week after news of the release leaked through the game's crash logs. The reveal cinematic was drawn in an anime-style by Wolf Smoke Studio, based in Shanghai, who had previously expressed and rallied interest in developing an anime in the game's fictional universe. Blizzard also sent an official Doomfist cosplayer to the San Diego Comic-Con and Overwatch World Cup Sydney qualifier. Soon after the reveal, Doomfist became playable on the game's test servers, {{where some of the}} character's powers were rebalanced to reduce punch distance and vertical mobility. The playable character was released for all platforms on July 27, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2000, {{with the}} {{discovery}} of at least three bodies (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) all comparable to Pluto in terms of size and orbit, it became clear that either they all had to be called planets or Pluto would have to be reclassified. Astronomers also knew that more objects as large as Pluto would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing quickly. They were also concerned about the classification of planets in other planetary systems. In 2006, the matter came to a head with the first measurement of the size of Eris. That measurement had showed Eris (as it was mistakenly believed to be until the New Horizons mission to Pluto) <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> slightly larger than Pluto, and so was thought to be equally deserving of the status of 'planet' at the time.|$|E
5|$|The early-to-mid 1800s were {{a period}} of intense debate on the particle-versus-wave nature of light. Although the {{observation}} of the Arago spot in 1819 may seem to have settled the matter definitively in favor of Fresnel's wave theory of light, various concerns continued <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> addressed more satisfactorily by Newton's corpuscular theory. Arago had suggested in 1838 that a differential comparison {{of the speed of}} light in air versus water would serve to prove or disprove the wave nature of light. In 1850, racing against Foucault to establish this point, Fizeau engaged L.F.C. Breguet to build a rotary-mirror apparatus in which he split a beam of light into two beams, passing one through water while the other traveled through air. Beaten by Foucault by a mere seven weeks, he confirmed that the speed of light was greater as it traveled through air, validating the wave theory of light.|$|E

5|$|The {{members of}} his staff were anxious for the {{president}} <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> recovering quickly, and the morning after his operation he saw visitors and signed a piece of legislation. Reagan left the hospital on the 13th day. Initially, he worked {{two hours a day}} in the White House's residential quarters, with meetings held there instead of the Oval Office. Reagan did not lead a Cabinet meeting until day 26, did not leave Washington until day 49, and did not hold a press conference until day 79. Ruge, the Physician to the President, thought recovery was not complete until October. Reagan's plans for the month after the shooting were canceled, including a visit to the Mission Control Center at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, in April 1981 during STS-1, the first flight of the Space Shuttle. Vice President Bush instead called the orbiting astronauts during their mission. Reagan would visit Mission Control during STS-2 that November.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result {{in an area of}} high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E

25|$|From {{the late}} 1960s {{through the late}} 1970s, several {{hardware}} capabilities evolved that allowed similar or ported software to run {{on more than one}} system.

In Batesian mimicry, harmless animals may appear to be distasteful or poisonous. In automimicry, animals may have eyespots in less important parts of the body than the head, helping to distract attack and increase the chance of survival.|$|E

2500|$|India's National Investigation Agency (NIA) {{registered}} a {{case against}} Headley and Rana for allegedly plotting the Mumbai attacks.

Indian Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram reported that U.S. authorities shared [...] "significant information" [...] about the case. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert O.

Sivaramakrishnan is his given name and his father's given name was Laxmanan and hence he started out as L. Sivaramakrishnan as is common with Tamils to keep the first letter of one's father's first name as initial.|$|E
25|$|Another example where visual {{appearance}} {{is at odds}} with measurement comes from the observation of apparent superluminal motion in various radio galaxies, BL Lac objects, quasars, and other astronomical objects that eject relativistic-speed jets of matter at narrow angles with respect to the viewer. An optical illusion results giving the appearance of faster than light travel. In Fig.1‑14, galaxy M87 streams out a high-speed jet of subatomic particles almost directly towards us, but Penrose–Terrell rotation causes the jet <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moving laterally in the same manner that the appearance of the cube in Fig.1‑13 has been stretched out.|$|E
25|$|People with SPD are {{sometimes}} sexually apathetic, {{though they do}} not typically suffer from anorgasmia. Their preference to remain alone and detached may cause their need for sex <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{less than that of}} those who do not have SPD. Sex often causes individuals with SPD to feel that their personal space is being violated, and they commonly feel that masturbation or sexual abstinence is preferable to the emotional closeness they must tolerate when having sex. Significantly broadening this picture are notable exceptions of SPD individuals who engage in occasional or even frequent sexual activities with others.|$|E

25|$|Windows NT Workstation (Microsoft {{marketing}} wanted Windows NT <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a continuation}} of Windows 3.1) arrived in Beta form to developers at the July 1992 Professional Developers Conference in San Francisco. Microsoft announced at the conference its intentions to develop a successor to both Windows NT and Windows 3.1's replacement (Windows 95, codenamed Chicago), which would unify the two into one operating system. This successor was codenamed Cairo. In hindsight, Cairo was {{a much more difficult}} project than Microsoft had anticipated and, as a result, NT and Chicago would not be unified until Windows XP—albeit Windows 2000, oriented to business, had already unified most of the system’s bolts and gears, it was XP that was sold to home consumers like Windows 95 and came to be viewed as the final unified OS. Parts of Cairo have still not made it into Windows as of 2017 - most notably, the WinFS file system, which was the much touted Object File System of Cairo. Microsoft announced that they have discontinued the separate release of WinFS for Windows XP and Windows Vista and will gradually incorporate the technologies developed for WinFS in other products and technologies, notably Microsoft SQL Server.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) {{confirmed}} that an internal review showed the corporation had falsified records involving about 4,800 employee hours {{over a period}} of seven months, at its Idaho State Correctional Center. In 2014 a subsequent KPMG audit showed the actual overbilling was for over 26,000 hours. Otter ordered Idaho State Police to investigate to see if criminal charges should be brought. Otter had received a total of $20,000 in campaign contributions from employees of the company since 2003. In March, the state announced that the FBI was taking over the investigation, as well as investigating CCA operations in other states. In January 2014, Otter announced that the state would take back the operations of the prison.
