According to Rennie, all content was stored in Watson's RAM for the Jeopardy game because data stored on hard drives would be <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> to be competitive with human Jeopardy champions.|$|E
5|$|Several Pacific island territories were {{particularly}} hard-hit. The pandemic reached them from New Zealand, which was <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> to implement measures to prevent ships carrying the flu from leaving its ports. From New Zealand, the flu reached Tonga (killing 8% of the population), Nauru (16%) and Fiji (5%, 9,000 people).|$|E
5|$|The League and {{the ideas}} of {{collective}} security {{and the rule of}} law were defeated; partly because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but partly because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Distributed Database Management System (DDBMS) {{is one of}} {{the prime}} {{concerns}} in distributed computing. The driving force of development of DDBMS is the demand of the applications that need to query very large databases (order of terabytes). Traditional Client-Server database systems are <b>too</b> <b>slower</b> to handle such applications. This paper presents a better way to find the optimal number of nodes in a distributed database management systems...|$|R

5|$|Yannick LeJacq of Kotaku, {{commenting on}} the 2014 game MouseCraft which {{incorporates}} elements of Lemmings and Tetris, speculated that games like Lemmings would not be very successful in the current gaming market, as {{the pace of the}} game is far <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> to satisfy most players.|$|E
5|$|As {{elevation}} {{continues to}} increase, only the hardiest trees {{remain in the}} forest, which is composed almost exclusively of balsam fir. Most of the understory plants and animals from the upper spruce-fir zone, however, {{can be found in}} this forest. Moisture causes nutrients to be stripped from the soil and brought to lower elevations, and decomposition takes place at a rate that is <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> to replenish them.|$|E
5|$|Coastal Command was {{assigned}} to the mission of defending the Convoys from aerial assault also. It lacked the proper training, tactics and suitable aircraft to pose a serious threat to Luftwaffe operations until the beginning of 1942. The Luftwaffe had also neglected naval aviation. Its only suitable weapon for use {{in the battle of the}} Atlantic was the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor. The Fw 200s began attacks in July 1940 from airfields in occupied France. At the time, Coastal Command had only 60 Avro Ansons, Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys, Short Sunderlands, and Lockheed Hudsons, all <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> and lightly armed to intercept the Fw 200. Most were also short-range. The Sunderland had the firepower and endurance, but was <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> to catch the Condor. Only one or two aircraft were sent to cover convoys as they approached Britain as a result air-to-air combat was rare. Only five recorded actions took place. The results were two RAF aircraft destroyed (one Hudson and one Whitley) for two Luftwaffe Condors destroyed and one damaged. Between August 1940 and February 1941, Fw 200s sank 85 vessels for a claimed total of 363,000 Grt.|$|E

Then came the sudden control down to the shorter step again, and she felt herself being held slightly from him {{so that he might}} look into her face and laugh with her in joy at the exploit. At the end, as the band slowed in the last bars, they, <b>too,</b> <b>slowed,</b> their dance fading with the music in a lengthening glide that ceased with the last lingering tone.|$|R

5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game's formula, including its open-ended nature {{and its ability to}} immerse the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game's lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it harder to learn how to play the game. The in-game speed was also criticized for being <b>too</b> <b>slow,</b> which was a crucial issue in the game because time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.|$|E
5|$|Cryptum {{received}} mixed reviews; {{some critics}} liked the Forerunner culture and suspense that Bear created, but others disliked the characters, found the plot <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> {{and concluded that}} the novel was suited only to existing fans of the Halo series. Cryptum appeared on multiple bestseller lists after promotion on Halo Waypoint, a website that serves as a hub for Halo-related information.|$|E
5|$|Forward Unto Dawn {{received}} a Streamy Award {{and several of}} the crew {{received a}}wards for their work editing, producing and filming of it. The series also won a Motion Picture Sound Editors Golden Reel Award for sound editing. Reviewers were impressed by the special effects and action-packed second act, but found that the plot was <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> {{in the first half and}} most of the characters were under-developed. The series was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for main title design.|$|E
50|$|The grid was {{reformed}} and {{the field}} tried to get away again. Piquet went into the lead but Mansell had a problem and was crawling away slowly. Berger <b>too</b> <b>slowed</b> suddenly {{as he tried to}} pass the Williams and so there was serious congestion behind with the result that Patrese hit Eddie Cheever (Arrows-Megatron). Johansson hit the back of Cheever and Brundle hit the rear of the McLaren. This resulted in Ghinzani braking and being hit by Alex Caffi's Osella and Ivan Capelli (March), Philippe Alliot (Larrousse Lola), Christian Danner (Zakspeed) and Philippe Streiff (Tyrrell) all becoming involved and then Pascal Fabre (AGS) driving over the back of Jonathan Palmer's Tyrrell. The track was blocked again and the race red flagged for a second time.|$|R

50|$|The {{third major}} {{operation}} opened on October 24, when the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division began its advance down the South Beveland peninsula. The Canadians hoped to advance rapidly, bypassing opposition and seizing bridgeheads over the Beveland Canal, but they <b>too</b> were <b>slowed</b> by mines, mud and strong enemy defences.|$|R
5|$|Humans are not {{appropriate}} prey because the shark's digestion is <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> {{to cope with}} a human's high ratio of bone to muscle and fat. Accordingly, in most recorded shark bite incidents, great whites broke off contact after the first bite. Fatalities are usually caused by blood loss from the initial bite rather than from critical organ loss or from whole consumption. From 1990 to 2011 there have been a total of 139 unprovoked great white shark bite incidents, 29 fatal.|$|E
5|$|In October 2009, New Zealand's {{independent}} environmental watchdog, Jan Wright, the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, made a {{submission to}} the Select Committee considering National's {{amendments to the}} NZ ETS. The submission stated that the allocation of free units to industry was too generous {{and the length of}} the phase-out of free allocation was <b>too</b> <b>slow.</b> Without a carbon price signal to invest in low carbon technologies, emissions would continue to rise.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1936–37 season, the Rangers signed Johnson {{to serve}} as the {{defensive}} coach while he continued to play. He appeared in 35 games but scored no points. Seeing little playing time, and having an offer to coach a minor league team, Johnson requested that the Rangers give him his outright release following the season. Believing that he had become <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> to play, the team agreed. He subsequently signed with the New York Americans, with whom he played one final NHL season in 1937–38.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} carrier I {{was the first}} planned {{aircraft carrier}} conversion project of the German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) during World War I. The Imperial Navy had experimented previously with seaplane carriers, though these earlier conversions were <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> to operate with the High Seas Fleet and carried an insufficient number of aircraft. I was intended to carry between 23 and 30 aircraft, including fighters, bombers, and torpedo-bombers.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler summoned Lieutenant-General Kurt Student of the 7. Flieger-Division (7th Air Division) {{to discuss}} the assault. It was first {{suggested}} that a conventional parachute drop be made by airborne forces to seize and destroy the forts' guns before the land units approached. Such a suggestion was rejected as the Junkers Ju 52 transports were <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> and {{were likely to be}} vulnerable to Dutch and Belgian anti-aircraft guns. Other factors for its refusal were the weather conditions, which might blow the paratroopers away from the fort and disperse them too widely. A seven-second drop from a Ju 52 at minimum operational height led to a dispersion over 300metres alone.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} pit stops, the Mercedes drivers had {{to manage their}} tyres in order to cover from a {{possible}} attack by Ferrari, who had an extra set of fresh tyres saved from qualifying. Rosberg however complained over the radio about Hamilton {{in front of him}} driving <b>too</b> <b>slow,</b> which caused him to back into the charging Ferraris. He was unable to risk driving too close behind Hamilton, because dispersed air {{from the back of the}} car was accelerating tyre degradation. Hamilton was therefore asked by the team to pick up the pace.|$|E
50|$|As in many music/rhythm-based games, {{every single}} note {{is given a}} title based on the accuracy, and the more {{accurate}} notes increase the score by more. These ranks are Best (perfect timing), Good (slightly <b>too</b> fast or <b>slow),</b> Bad (the note's head will not disappear; much <b>too</b> fast or <b>slow)</b> and Miss (the correct note was not played at all, or stopped {{before the end of}} the tail). At the end of a song, the score is calculated as a number out of 100.|$|R

5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually <b>too</b> <b>slow,</b> contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War in August 1914, she was mobilised for service in the South America Station, where she patrolled for German commerce raiders. She was involved in the search for the German East Asia Squadron of Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee. <b>Too</b> <b>slow</b> to follow Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock's cruisers, she missed the Battle of Coronel in November 1914, where Cradock was defeated. Moored at Port Stanley as a defensive battery, she fired the first shots of the Battle of the Falklands in December, which led Spee to break off the attack before being chased down and destroyed by Admiral Doveton Sturdee's battlecruisers.|$|E
5|$|Captained by Commander Geoffrey Layton, her post-completion trials {{lasted for}} five months as {{she was used to}} {{evaluate}} steam power for submarine use. Much was learned about the operation of steam submarines, which helped the subsequent design of the steam-powered K-class fleet submarines. She proved to be very unstable while surfacing, presumably because she could not pump the water out of her controlled free-flooding spaces quickly enough in the upper part of her double hull. These problems, coupled with {{the fact that she was}} <b>too</b> <b>slow</b> to work with the fleet as originally envisioned, meant that she was impossible to make into an effective warship, and she was laid up after her trials.|$|E
50|$|The {{shrink factor}} {{has a great}} effect on the {{efficiency}} of comb sort. k = 1.3 has been suggested as an ideal shrink factor by {{the authors of the}} original article after empirical testing on over 200,000 random lists. A value <b>too</b> small <b>slows</b> the algorithm down by making unnecessarily many comparisons, whereas a value too large fails to effectively deal with turtles.|$|R

The unexploded bomb contained valuable clues as to the bombers’ method. In addition, investigators were able to trace the dynamite back to its source.|$|R
