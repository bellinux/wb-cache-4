In a study, the child's father is sitting; Rover enters and pleads with him to follow. They leave, with the man {{following}} the dog across the river in a boat to the slums. They enter the room where the child is hidden, and the father quickly takes <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>from</b> the beggar woman and leaves with the dog. Upon their return home, the child is placed in the arms of the mother, while Rover prances happily around them.|$|E
5|$|Consumed with remorse, {{the king}} sought {{to rectify the}} {{situation}} by arranging a marriage between his brother's orphaned son and Andriamanelo's own sister (the orphan's aunt), Rafotsindrindramanjaka. He declared that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>from</b> this union would, if female, be wed to his own son Ralambo; if male, he would become Ralambo's successor. A girl was born, and she was promised to Ralambo as his future wife with the stipulation that the child born of their union would rule after Ralambo. In this way Andriamanelo established a tradition of succession that indirectly respected the queens' decree by ensuring that a child of his brother's line (and his own) would rule after him. Because of this decree, Ralambo's first son by his second wife was passed over {{in the line of}} succession in favor of Andrianjaka, Ralambo's son by Rafotsindrindramanjaka. Andriamanelo was also reportedly the first to formally establish the andriana as a caste of Merina nobles, thereby laying the foundation for a stratified and structured society. From this point forward, the term Hova was used to refer only to the non-noble free people of the society which would later be renamed Merina by Andriamanelo's son Ralambo.|$|E

25|$|The {{means by}} which future singers were {{prepared}} could lead to premature death. To prevent <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>from</b> experiencing the intense pain of castration, many were inadvertently administered lethal doses of opium or some other narcotic, or were killed by overlong compression of the carotid artery in the neck (intended to render them unconscious during the castration procedure).|$|E
25|$|By 1980, after {{a year-long}} trip to Europe, the Carsons {{returned}} to the U.S. and moved into the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco, California, where they continued their involvement with drugs and the counterculture. By this time, Michael Bear Carson's former wife had become afraid that he would harm her and try to abduct their child, taking steps to hide herself and <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>from</b> him. She {{went so far as}} to move numerous times and cut off contact with mutual acquaintances.|$|E
25|$|Attentional control {{refers to}} an individual's {{capacity}} to choose what they pay attention to and what they ignore. The ability to regulate and direct attention releases <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>from</b> the constraints of only responding to environmental events, and means they are able actively to guide their attention towards the information-rich areas key for learning. For example, a number of authors {{have looked at the}} relationship between an infants' capacity to exercise attentional control and their subsequent performance during language acquisition.|$|E

25|$|Vocabulary: A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} reading comprehension is vocabulary development. When a reader encounters an unfamiliar word {{in print and}} decodes it to derive its spoken pronunciation, the reader understands the word {{if it is in}} the reader's spoken vocabulary. Otherwise, the reader must derive {{the meaning of the word}} using another strategy, such as context. If the development of the child's vocabulary is impeded by things such as ear infections, that inhibit <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>from</b> hearing new words consistently, then the development of reading will also be impaired.|$|E

By April 21, enhanced surveillance was established to search for additional cases in both California and Texas and the CDC determined that the virus strain was genetically similar to the previously known A(H1N1) swine flu circulating among pigs in the United States since about 1999.|$|E
25|$|Most {{children}} with a form of clefting are monitored by a cleft palate team or craniofacial team through young adulthood. Care can be lifelong. Treatment procedures can vary between craniofacial teams. For example, some teams wait on jaw correction until the child is aged 10 to 12 (argument: growth is less influential as deciduous teeth are replaced by permanent teeth, thus saving <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>from</b> repeated corrective surgeries), while other teams correct the jaw earlier (argument: less speech therapy is needed than at a later age when speech therapy becomes harder). Within teams, treatment can differ between individual cases {{depending on the type}} and severity of the cleft.|$|E

25|$|The Métis label defined these {{children}} as a marginal people with a fluid identity. Early on in the fur trade, Métis were not defined by their racial category, but rather by {{the way of life}} they chose. These children were generally the offspring of white men and Native mothers and were often raised to follow the mother’s lifestyle. The father could influence the enculturation process and prevent <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>from</b> being classified as Métis {{in the early years of}} the western fur trade. Fur families often included displaced native women who lived near forts and formed networks among themselves. These networks helped to create kinship between tribes which benefitted the traders. Catholics tried their best to validate these unions through marriages. But missionaries and priests often had trouble categorizing the women, especially when establishing tribal identity.|$|E
25|$|Outdooring ceremonies {{can vary}} in {{practice}} {{among the different}} Ghanaian ethnic groups. The Ga place drops of water and alcohol onto the child's tongue to symbolize teaching them the difference between good and evil, and they may also place a piece of food such as kenkey so the child will appreciate a staple food of the Ga. Some groups practice raising the baby toward the sky three times to introduce them to heaven and Earth. Libations are also poured and live sacrifices of chickens or goats are made to ensure good health and protect <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>from</b> evil. The father or an elder will call out the child's name for the guests to repeat aloud to formally welcome the child into the community. After the naming concludes, friends and relatives give gifts to the family, and feasting and dancing follows.|$|E
25|$|According to tradition, when Muhammad {{was either}} nine or twelve years old, {{he went with}} his uncle Abu Talib on a {{business}} journey to Syria. There he met Bahira {{in the town of}} Bosra. When the caravan was passing by his cell, the monk invited the merchants to a feast. They accepted the invitation, leaving the boy to guard the camel. Bahira, however, insisted that everyone in the caravan should come to him. Then a miraculous occurrence indicated to the monk that Muhammad was to become a prophet. According to one version, those were the stigmata that Bahira found on young Muhammad. Other variants of the story say that it was a miraculous movement of a cloud or an unusual behavior of a branch that kept shadowing Muhammad regardless of the time of the day. The monk revealed his visions of Muhammad's future to the boy's companion, warning him to preserve <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>from</b> the Jews (in Ibn Sa'd's version) or from the Byzantines (in al-Tabari's version).|$|E

25|$|Participation is {{involvement}} in life situations and everyday activities. Participation includes {{the domains of}} self-care, productivity and leisure. In fact, communication, mobility, education, home life, leisure and social relationships require participation and are indicators {{of the extent to}} which a child functions in his or her environment. Barriers can exist on three levels: micro, meso and macro. First, the barriers at the micro level involve the person. Barriers at the micro level include the child's physical limitations (motor, sensory and cognitive impairments) or their subjective feelings regarding their ability to participate. For example, the child may not participate in group activities due to lack of confidence. Second, barriers at the meso level include the family and community. These may include negative attitudes of people toward disability or lack of support within the family or in the community. One of the main reasons for this limited support appears to be the result of a lack of awareness and knowledge regarding the child's ability to engage in activities despite his or her disability. Third, barriers at the macro level incorporate the systems and policies that are not in place or hinder children with CP. These may be environmental barriers to participation such as architectural barriers, lack of relevant assistive technology and transportation difficulties due to limited wheelchair access or public transit that can accommodate children with CP. For example, a building without an elevator will prevent <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>from</b> accessing higher floors.|$|E

The circumstances of this expedition remain clouded in mystery. There is great confusion about the identity of Margaret's parents, although Tubman indicated they were free blacks. The girl had left behind a twin brother and a loving home in Maryland. Years later, Margaret's daughter Alice called Tubman's actions selfish, saying, [...] "she had taken <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>from</b> a sheltered good home {{to a place where}} there was nobody to care for her."

500|$|With {{a newborn}} involved, the {{decision}} is made more complex due {{to the principles of}} respect for autonomy and consent, as a newborn cannot understand or engage in a logical discussion of his own values and best interests. [...] A mentally more mature child can understand the issues involved to some degree, and the physician and parents may elicit input from the child and weigh it appropriately in the decision-making process, although the law may not treat such input as legally informative. Ethicists and legal theorists also state that it is questionable for parents to make a decision for the child that precludes <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>from</b> making a different decision for himself later. Such a question can be raised for the decision by the parents either to circumcise or not to circumcise the child.|$|E
