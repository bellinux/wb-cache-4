40|$|Context: Bangladesh {{reportedly}} {{has more than}} 100 tribal communities; however, documentation of their medicinal practices is markedly absent. Aim: The aim {{of the present study}} was to conduct an ethnomedicinal survey among the little known Bauri tribe of Bangladesh, whose tribal medicinal practices are yet to be documented. Settings and Design: The survey was carried out among the Bauri tribal community of Purbo Tila village in Moulvibazar District. The community is believed to be the only Bauri community in the country and had four tribal healers who continue their traditional medicinal practices. Materials and Methods: Interviews of the healers were carried out with the help of a semi-structured questionnaire and the guided field-walk method where the healers took the interviewers on guided field-walks through areas from where they collected their medicinal plants. Here they identified the plants and described their uses. Results: The Bauri healers were observed to use 40 different plant species and one bird species for treatment of ailments such as fever, respiratory tract disorders, pain, gastrointestinal disorders, eye problems like cataract and conjunctivitis, jaundice, abscess, cardiovascular disorders, urinary problems, paralysis, dog bite, snake bite, helminthiasis, lesions on the tongue or lips and piles. Leaves were the major plant part used and constituted 38. 3 % of <b>total</b> <b>uses</b> followed by fruits at 14. 9 %.

Semi-structured interview, field observation, group discussion, market survey, and pair wise ranking {{were employed to}} gather ethnobotanical data. The information was collected from informants of three ethnic groups namely, Kusume, Derashe and Gamo people. The study documented 66 edible plant species belonging to 54 genera and 34 families. Of the reported edibles, 83. 3 % {{have more than one}} use categories. Food, medicine, construction/technology, and fuel wood had contributed 79 % of the <b>total</b> <b>uses.</b> Of the recorded wild edible plant species, 78. 8 % were reported to be edible both in normal and food shortage times. Procurement and use of most edibles were found to be age and gender specific. However, species use under various use categories does not vary among the communities (X 2 = 3. 89, df = 6, α = 0. 05 and 1 -α = 12. 6). The study showed that the majority (62. 1 %) of the species were collected from wooded grassland/or bush land vegetation type. Pair wise ranking results indicated that agricultural expansion, over stocking/overgrazing, fuel wood collection, and uncontrolled fire setting as principal threats to wild edible plants in the study areas. The findings suggest that (i) Public awareness and community based management need to be encouraged at all levels in order to overcome the threats; (ii) further investigation into nutritional properties of all the species reported; and (iii) Since the species are also nutraceutical, study on the pharmacological attributes would help to understand their medicinal applications. Furthermore, urgent collection of germplasm from areas under human pressure is recommended. </p...|$|E

Vegetation data was collected along with ethnobotanical information from purposefully selected  areas of the wereda. A total of 17 traditional healers with most of them aged from 28 to 70 years from different parts of the wereda  were purposefully selected and information was collected through the use of questionnaires and personal interviews during field trips in the Korre ethnic group from August to December 2012. Descriptive analysis was made for the data collected. A total of 56 plant species were reported by traditional healers of the Korre ethnic groups for their medicinal uses, representing 52 genera and 32 families. The majority (76. 8 %) were wild.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that 300 – 500 million malaria infections occur on an annual basis and causes fatality to millions of human beings. Most of the drugs used for treatment of malaria have developed drug-resistant parasites or have serious side effects. Plant kingdom has throughout the centuries proved to be efficient source of efficacious malarial drugs like quinine and artemisinin. Since these drugs have already developed or {{in the process of developing}} drug resistance, it is important to continuously search the plant kingdom for more effective antimalarial drugs. In this aspect, the medicinal practices of indigenous communities can play a major role in identification of antimalarial plants. Bangladesh has a number of indigenous communities or tribes, who because of their living within or in close proximity to mosquito-infested forest regions, have high incidences of malaria. Over the centuries, the tribal medicinal practitioners have treated malaria with various plant-based formulations. The objective of the present study was to conduct an ethnomedicinal survey among various tribes of Bangladesh to identify the plants that they use for treatment of the disease. Surveys were conducted among seven tribes, namely, Bawm, Chak, Chakma, Garo, Marma, Murong, and Tripura, who inhabit the southeastern or northcentral forested regions of Bangladesh. Interviews conducted with the various tribal medicinal practitioners indicated that a total of eleven plants distributed into 10 families were used for treatment of malaria and accompanying symptoms like fever, anemia, ache, vomiting, and chills. Leaves constituted 35. 7 % of <b>total</b> <b>uses</b> followed by roots at 21. 4 %. Other plant parts used for treatment included barks, seeds, fruits, and flowers. A review of the published scientific literature showed that a number of plants used by the tribal medicinal practitioners have been scientifically validated in their uses.

40|$|The {{need for}} more {{stakeholder}} participation is becoming increasingly important in natural resource management and for water resources in particular. There {{are a number of}} methods to facilitate the participatory process but in many cases the quality of these methods is difficult to evaluate {{because of the lack of}} appropriate benchmarks. Therefore there is a need of researches evaluating participatory process with clear evaluation criteria. This paper describes the development of a participatory decision support system based on Bayesian networks (Bns) and evaluates the implementation of the methodology using selected criteria. The work has been conducted in the Upper Guadiana Basin (UGB) in central Spain, a site of serious water management conflict, where groundwater-based irrigation is the main water consumer, accounting for 95 % of the <b>total</b> <b>uses.</b> The uncontrolled exploitation of groundwater resources along several decades has led to an important environmental degradation and significant conflicts among stakeholder groups. The need to find solutions is becoming more urgent since the implementation of the Water Framework requires a good state of water ecosystems in the short term. The participatory building of Bayesian networks was lead to three-fold objectives: (1) To develop a DSS in the UGB, which allows the impacts of different water management options on the groundwater levels and agricultural economy to be evaluated. (2) To improve the knowledge of key water users and provide a platform for dialogue among stakeholders. (3) To evaluate the ability of Bns to provide support in complex conflict situations and as a means to more effectively engage stakeholders in the decision making process. The results obtained show that, in this context, the elaboration of a Bayesian network requires simplification of the problem, which helps stakeholders to understand the elements involved in the problem and the relationships among them. In addition to this, Bayesian networks have proved to be a good tool to deal with stakeholder participation, due to their defined structured elaboration process...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Nepal {{is small}} in size but rich in bio-cultural diversity. The rugged terrain {{of the country}} is home to a number of unique assemblages of fauna, some of which are endemic. Not only faunal {{resources}} the country also harbors some very ancient populations whose interrelationship with these diverse faunal resources is very intimate and thus demands scientific study. Animals play important role in both material and spiritual spheres of their life. There are more than hundred groups of such populations in the country and the group Tamang is one of these. The present paper studies Tamang-animal relationships in central Nepal. There is a growing trend of scientific ethnozoological studies all across the globe, but this field is yet in its infancy in Nepal. The country is losing important fauna as well as ancient human cultures at the advent of development processes. As a result, ethnozoological knowledge is also teetering on the brink of extinction. Methods Ethnozoological data were collected by applying different participatory approaches techniques such as semi-structured interviews, participatory rural appraisal, key informant interviews and focus group discussions. Quantitative data were obtained by employing a household level questionnaire survey. Data were collected from the period of September 2004 to August 2005. Most of the animals were identified up to the species level with the help of standard taxonomic keys. Results The Tamang community treasures knowledge on various uses of 41 genera belonging to 28 families. Out of total number of animals, 14. 6 % belong to the Invertebrate group and the rest to the Vertebrate group. Of the <b>total</b> <b>uses</b> 58 % fall in the food and medicinal use category, 16 % in the magico-religious use category, 18 % in the category of omen indication, and 2 % each in the categories such as weather forecasting, trophy, ethnomusical and taboos. Conclusions The Tamang maintain strong ties with animals both at a material as well as spiritual level. While some animals are the sources of important traditional medicines, others are omen indicators and weather forecasters. High priority should be given in conservation of those animals which are of high consensus value to the community. </p...|$|E

These Sources are summed and evaluated {{for each of the}} five years, and for a five-year <b>total.</b> <b>Uses</b> are determined by data provided by the Action Plan(s) and another HUD mandated annual report titled the Comprehensive Annual Performance and Evaluation Report(s) (CAPER). Uses are summed and evaluated for each of the five years, and for the five years, and for the five-year total. Specific categories of Use are also reviewed and analyzed, with emphasis placed on USE for Housing Activities. Uses per individual sub-grants (the City of Flint is considered the Grantee) and summed totals are compared and analyzed for discrepancies. The discovery of inconsistency in naming conventions and errors in mathematical computations, necessitated a mid-step of standardizing the data available from the public documents. Accurate knowledge of Use of Block Grant Funds was not possible utilizing only the public documents. The City of Flint Block Grants are then compared with Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA) grant awards made during this same time period, for Housing Activities, to Flint area organizations. These MSHDA grants are considered to be a means of increasing the funds available for Housing Activities, which is known as leveraging. Analysis is provided regarding City of Flint Block Grant leveraging of MSHDA dollars. Recipients receiving city Block Grants for Housing Activities only leveraged nine percent of these dollars with MSHDA funds. An analysis of final Use of Block Grants for Housing Category is provided through a review of CAPER reports to determine changes made in allocations and funds expended, and/or balances remaining unspent. The recipient demonstrating the greatest change between allocation and use of Block Grant funds for Housing Category is the City of Flint as the recipient. During this five- year period, the City of Flint consistently under-utilized the funding it allocated to itself. Comparison of stated Consolidated Plan priorities to actual allocations is attempted but the City of Flint methodology and allocation categorizations preclude the possibility of any relevant comparison and analysis...|$|E
40|$|Medicinal plants form an {{important}} and often the only component in the formulations used by the folk medicinal practitioners of Bangladesh for treatment of various ailments. Folk medicinal practitioners, otherwise known as Kavirajes, perform an integral role {{in the delivery of}} primary health-care to substantial segments of both rural and urban population of the country. Their traditional medicinal practice, which is generally referred to as folk medicinal practice, is different from other forms of traditional medicine in Bangladesh like Ayurveda and Unani forms of traditional medicine. Kavirajes use simple formulations of medicinal plants, and their practice is often confined to the immediate family and passed on through successive generations. Thus over the centuries, Kavirajes have gained not only extensive knowledge on medicinal plants but also each Kaviraj has his or her own unique list of plants, which he or she uses in formulations. Bangladesh has over 86, 000 villages with each village containing one or two practicing Kavirajes. To get a comprehensive view of the medicinal plants of Bangladesh, it is therefore important to conduct extensive interviews of individual Kavirajes of both urban and rural areas. Towards obtaining such comprehensive information, the present ethnomedicinal survey was conducted among the Kavirajes of three randomly surveyed villages of Rajbari district in Bangladesh to document their use of medicinal plants and the ailments treated by those plants. Information was obtained from the Kavirajes {{with the help of a}} semi-structured questionnaire and the guided field-walk method. The results showed that the Kavirajes of the three villages surveyed used a total of 46 plants distributed into 31 families in their formulations. The Fabaceae family provided 6 plants, while the Acanthaceae, Lamiaceae and Zingiberaceae families provided three plants each. Leaves constituted the major plant part used, constituting over 50 % of the <b>total</b> <b>uses.</b> Other major plant parts used were roots and stems. The various ailments treated included gastrointestinal disorders, cuts and wounds, fever, respiratory tract disorders, snake bites, pain, menstrual problems, physical weakness, diabetes, mental disorders, cardiovascular disorders, skin disorders, chicken pox, burns, spermatorrhea, bone fractures, and cattle ailments. Medicinal plants from time immemorial have proved an excellent source of medicines and this trend has continued even in recent times. As such, the medicinal plants documented in the present survey have enormous potential for further scientific research, which can lead to discovery of better medicines. At the same time, a resurgence of interest in medicinal plants can lead to their wide-spread conservation, which is important because a number of medicinal plants have become endangered through spread of human habitat and loss of primary and secondary forests...|$|E
