5|$|Von Neumann {{founded the}} field of game theory as a {{mathematical}} discipline. Von Neumann proved his minimax theorem in 1928. This theorem establishes that in zero-sum games with perfect information (i.e. in which players know at each time all moves {{that have taken place}} so far), there exists a pair of strategies for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses, hence the name minimax. When examining every possible strategy, a player must consider all the possible responses of his adversary. The player then plays out the strategy <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> the minimization of his maximum loss.|$|E
5|$|To {{allow for}} track or {{forecast}} uncertainties, usually several model runs with varying input parameters are generated {{to create a}} map of MOMs, or Maximum of Maximums. For hurricane evacuation studies, a family of storms with representative tracks for the region, and varying intensity, eye diameter, and speed, are modeled to produce worst-case water heights for any tropical cyclone occurrence. The results of these studies are typically generated from several thousand SLOSH runs. These studies have been completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, under contract to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for several states and are available on their Hurricane Evacuation Studies (HES) website. They include coastal county maps, shaded to identify the minimum category of hurricane <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> flooding, in each area of the county.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} promote the desired {{alkylation}} reactions, which are those involving isobutane and olefins, {{it is necessary to}} maintain a high concentration of isobutane in the reaction zone. Low isobutane-olefin ratios increase the likelihood of olefin-olefi polymerization <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> lower octane. Polymerization reactions also have a higher rate of production of acid soluble oils, resulting in higher acid consumption.|$|E

The impacts of a changing climate could have a potentially devastating effect. Sea level rise will cause increased coastal flooding and erosion.

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{wetlands}} permits: general permits and individual permits. General permits change periodically and cover broad categories of activities, and require the permittee to comply with all stated conditions. General permits (such as the Nationwide Permits) are issued for fill activities <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> minimal adverse effects to the environment. Individual permits are utilized for actions that are not addressed by a general permit, or that {{do not meet the}} conditions of a General Permit. In addition, individual permits typically require more analysis than do the general permits, and usually require much more time to prepare the application and to process the permit.|$|E

25|$|A poll {{conducted}} for KSTP-TV in the Twin Cities in October showed Oberstar ahead of Cravaack {{by only one}} point, 47 to 46 percent. Cravaack received the endorsement of former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich as the polls tightened. He was also endorsed by Minnesota's largest pro-life organization, Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, and the largest newspaper in the district, the Duluth News Tribune. In the November 2 election, Cravaack scored {{one of the biggest}} upsets in Minnesota political history, defeating Oberstar by only 4,400 votes, 48 percent to 47 percent. Cravaack believed the abortion issue was crucial to his victory; he had argued that the health care legislation that Oberstar had voted for allowed for the payment of abortions with taxpayer funds, and encouraged euthanasia for the elderly. By the time he won the election, Cravaack characterized the bill as an example of socialized medicine <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> the rationing of medical care.|$|E
25|$|This {{version of}} Light is {{different}} to his manga counterpart {{in the fact}} that he never loses sight of his goal to make the world better for the innocent. Unlike Light Yagami, Light Turner never kills any police officers and never truly lets the power of the Death Note overtake him. Instead, his ruthless qualities are transferred to Mia, who uses the notebook in secret to kill police and innocents that are trying to find Light and, by association, herself. In the end, she writes Light's name in the notebook to make him transfer ownership of the notebook to her, showing her true nature and calling the death note her notebook. However, Light creates a plan <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> his survival and her death if she attempts to take the notebook, which she does despite how much he tries to convince her to let it go and be with him instead, having truly fallen in love with Mia by writing her name in it as well. In the end, through using two criminals that he controlled using the Death Note, Light manages to trick the police into believing that he wasn't Kira with the exception of his father, who worked out the truth after finding newspaper articles about his mother's murder. The film ends with his father asking Light, in response to what he said, if he was truly {{the lesser of two evils}} when compared to Mia while L finds a page of the death note, and wonders whether to write Light's name.|$|E
