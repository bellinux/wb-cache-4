5|$|On January 6, 1917, Rutherford, aged 47, {{was elected}} {{president}} of the Watch Tower Society, unopposed, at the Pittsburgh convention. By-laws passed by both the Pittsburgh convention and the board of directors stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> be the executive officer and general manager of the Society, giving him full charge of its affairs worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} also shortened the president's term {{from seven}} years to four years, freed the president to seek re-election after an initial term, and moved impeachment trials from the courts to the Senate. They also created {{the office of the}} vice president, whose only roles were to succeed a president unable to complete a term of office, to preside over the Senate, and to cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate. The committee transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, for example the power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors. One controversial issue throughout much of the Convention had been the length of the president's term, and whether the president was to be term limited. The problem had resulted from the understanding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> be chosen by Congress; the decision to have the president be chosen instead by an electoral college reduced the chance of the president becoming beholden to Congress, so a shorter term with eligibility for re-election became a viable option.|$|E
25|$|Russell died on October 31, 1916, in Pampa, Texas {{during a}} {{cross-country}} preaching trip. On January 6, 1917, {{board member and}} society legal counsel Joseph Franklin Rutherford, aged 47, {{was elected president of}} the Watch Tower Society, unopposed, at the Pittsburgh convention. Under his presidency, the role of the society underwent a major change. By-laws passed by both the Pittsburgh convention and the board of directors stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> be the executive officer and general manager of the society, giving him full charge of its affairs worldwide.|$|E

50|$|During Augusto Pinochet's {{military}} regime from 1973 to 1989, the University experienced many profound changes. On 2 October 1973, Decree number 50 of 1973 stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> University's <b>presidents</b> <b>would</b> be {{designated by the}} {{military regime}}.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, <b>the</b> AEA <b>Presidents</b> {{determined}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> AEA {{should become}} an organisation, which provides an industry platform for its {{members in the}} EU policy-making environment. To achieve this end, the statutes were amended. One major change was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidents</b> <b>would</b> set annual objectives for the Association. The Presidentsâ€™ Committee, enlarged by two additional members to twelve, was given the additional task of monitoring {{the progress of the}} association in achieving the set objectives. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>Presidents</b> modified <b>the</b> criteria for entry and exit into the association to reflect recent market developments. These far-reaching amendments to the statutes were formally approved in May 2003.|$|R
25|$|The {{text of the}} Constitution of Ireland, as {{originally}} enacted in 1937, made reference in its controversial Articles 2 and 3 to two geopolitical entities: a thirty-two county 'national territory' (i.e., the island of Ireland), and a twenty-six county 'state' {{formerly known as the}} Irish Free State. The implication behind the title 'President of Ireland' was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> function as the head of all Ireland. However, this implication was challenged by the Ulster Unionists and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland which was the state internationally acknowledged as having jurisdiction over Northern Ireland. Articles 2 and 3 were substantially amended in consequence of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.|$|E
25|$|Johnson made eleven {{international}} {{trips to}} twenty countries during his presidency. He flew 523,000 miles aboard Air Force One while in office. His October 1966 visit to Australia sparked demonstrations from anti-war protesters. One {{of the most}} unusual international trips in presidential history occurred before Christmas in 1967. The President began the trip by going to the memorial service for Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt, who had disappeared in a swimming accident and was presumed drowned. The White House did not reveal in advance to the press <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> make the first round-the-world presidential trip. The trip was 26,959 miles completed in only 112.5 hours (4.7 days). Air Force One crossed the equator twice, stopped in Travis Air Force Base, Calif., then Honolulu, Pago Pago, Canberra, Melbourne, Vietnam, Karachi and Rome.|$|E
25|$|On 2 July, {{opponents and}} {{supporters}} of Morsi gathered in the capital, Cairo, as the deadline set by the military {{for him to leave}} power passed. Helicopters were also present around Cairo with armored vehicles taking up positions. On 3 July, clashes between protestors and local residents erupted around a pro-Morsi rally near Cairo University, leaving 18 people dead. Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr also resigned, in support of the anti-government protesters. The presidency rejected the Egyptian Army's 48-hour ultimatum, vowing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> pursue his own plans for national reconciliation to resolve the political crisis. Defense Minister General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi was also said to have told Morsi that he would impose a military solution if a political one could not be found by the next day. Incidentally, the Court of Cassation ordered the reinstatement of former general prosecutor Abdel Maguid Mahmoud who was replaced with Talaat Abdallah following the constitutional declaration on 22 November 2012. The presidential spokesman and the spokesman for the cabinet resigned as well.|$|E

2500|$|Also in {{the year}} 2008, Cristina Kirchner vetoed the [...] "Law of {{protection}} of the glaciers" [...] ( [...] ), which had been approved almost unanimously in Congress (only 3 senators opposed the law).

25|$|Tyler {{had joined}} the Whig ticket largely due to his {{perceived}} personal closeness with Clay, but he quickly proved to have political views of his own. Tyler retained Harrison's Cabinet, but quickly made it known that he had reservations about re-establishing a national bank, a key priority of Clay's. Clay saw the re-establishment of a national bank as policy in reviving the weak national economy, and Clay sought to compromise with Tyler to create national bank legislation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> not veto. In August 1841, Tyler was presented with a bill that incorporated some of Tyler's proposals. Tyler vetoed the bill over concerns that the national bank would compete with state banks. After Tyler told Whig Congressman Alexander Stuart that he would sign a similar bill that addressed his concerns, Congressional Whigs wrote another bill that they hoped would satisfy Tyler. On September 9, Tyler vetoed this bill as well. Tyler's second veto infuriated his fellow Whigs, and Tyler's Cabinet resigned, {{with the exception of}} Secretary of State Daniel Webster. Reflecting his belief in legislative supremacy and his anger at Tyler's actions, Clay unsuccessfully proposed Constitutional amendments removing the president's veto power and giving Congress the authority to appoint the Secretary of the Treasury.|$|E
25|$|Bissell {{suggested}} {{bringing the}} British {{into the program}} {{to increase the number}} of overflights. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan agreed with the plan, and four Royal Air Force (RAF) officers were sent to Laughlin Air Force Base in Texas for training in May 1958. On 8 July, the senior British pilot, Squadron Leader Christopher H. Walker, was killed when his U-2 malfunctioned and crashed near Wayside, Texas. This was the first death involving the U-2 and the circumstances were not disclosed for over 50 years. Another pilot was quickly selected and sent to replace Walker. After training, the group of RAF U-2 pilots arrived in Turkey in November 1958, shortly after the CIA's Detachment B from Adana provided valuable intelligence during the 1958 Lebanon crisis with both the United States and United Kingdom involvement. Since the September 1956 disclosure of Mediterranean photographs, the United Kingdom had received U-2 intelligence, except during the Suez Crisis. The CIA and Eisenhower viewed using British pilots as a way of increasing plausible deniability for the flights. The CIA also saw British participation as a way of obtaining additional Soviet overflights <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> not authorize. The United Kingdom gained the ability to target flights toward areas of the world the United States was less interested in, and possibly avoid another Suez-like interruption of U-2 photographs.|$|E
500|$|At around 9:45p.m. EDT, the White House {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> be {{addressing the}} nation {{later in the}} evening. At 2:24:05a.m. UTC May 2, 2011 the first public leak was made by Navy Reserve intel officer Keith Urbahn and 47 seconds later by actor and professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson on Twitter. Anonymous government officials confirmed details to the media, and by11 p.m. numerous major news sources were reporting that bin Laden was dead; the number of leaks were characterized as [...] "voluminous" [...] by David E. Sanger.|$|E

This practice has continued for senior positions in the Coast and Geodetic Survey and its successor organizations ever since.|$|R
50|$|Opinions of Bush {{from outside}} the U.S. are less than favorable. For example, a global {{sampling}} in 2005 of 21 nations found that 58% of those sampled believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> reelection <b>would</b> {{have a negative impact}} on their peace and security; only 26% believed it would have a positive one.|$|R
50|$|On 1 December 2005, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> {{announced}} <b>that</b> half of <b>the</b> {{members of}} the Federal National Council (FNC), an assembly <b>that</b> advises <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> <b>would</b> be indirectly elected. However, half of the council's members would {{still need to be}} appointed by the leaders of the emirates. The elections were set to take place in December 2006.|$|R
500|$|Chotiner advised President Nixon to fire Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox in October 1973 in {{what became}} known as the Saturday Night Massacre, telling Nixon, [...] "This guy Cox will use {{anything}} and everybody. It has to be taken away from him." [...] According to Nixon biographer and Chotiner friend Earl Mazo, he was convinced that [...] "Dick wouldn't have had anything to do with [...] " [...] and was also convinced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> put the scandal behind him by the spring of 1974.

500|$|MacArthur {{responded with}} a request that he might select {{the time of his}} departure. [...] "Unless the right moment is chosen for this {{delicate}} operation", he wrote, [...] "a sudden collapse might occur." [...] "With regard to the actual movement", he went on, [...] "I deem it advisable to go to Mindanao by combined use of surface craft and submarine, and thence by air, further movement by submarine being too time consuming." [...] Marshall replied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> allow him to choose the time and method of his departure. ABDA was dissolved on 27 February, and MacArthur nominally came under Dutch command, but was ordered to continue communicating directly with the War Department.|$|E
500|$|Following the Philadelphia Convention, some leading revolutionary {{figures such}} as Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, and Richard Henry Lee {{publicly}} opposed the new frame of government, a position known as [...] "Anti-Federalism". Elbridge Gerry wrote the most popular Anti-Federalist tract, [...] "Hon. Mr. Gerry's Objections", which went through 46 printings; the essay particularly focused {{on the lack of}} a bill of rights in the proposed constitution. Many were concerned that a strong national government was a threat to individual rights and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>would</b> become a king. Jefferson wrote to Madison advocating a Bill of Rights: [...] "Half a loaf is better than no bread. If we cannot secure all our rights, let us secure what we can."

500|$|Truman {{emulated}} this {{by flying}} to the Pacific to meet MacArthur. Initially, Truman was unenthusiastic about the idea, as he disliked publicity stunts, but in October 1950, {{in the wake}} of the victories at Pusan and Inchon, MacArthur's star was burning bright. By meeting with him, Truman could emphasize his own part in the victories, as Commander-in-Chief. A message was sent to MacArthur suggesting a meeting on Hawaii or Wake Island. MacArthur replied that he [...] "would be delighted to meet the President on the morning of the 15th at Wake Island." [...] When MacArthur discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> be bringing the news media with him, MacArthur asked if he could bring correspondents from Tokyo. His request was denied.|$|E
500|$|The {{letter was}} signed by Einstein and posted back to SzilÃ¡rd, who {{received}} it on August 9. SzilÃ¡rd gave both the short and long letters, along with a letter of his own, to Sachs on August 15. Sachs asked the White House staff for an appointment to see the President, but before one could be set up, the administration became embroiled in a crisis due to Germany's invasion of Poland, which started World War II. Sachs delayed his appointment until October so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> give the letter due attention, securing an appointment on October 11. On that date {{he met with the}} President, the President's secretary, Brigadier General Edwin [...] "Pa" [...] Watson, and two ordnance experts, Army Lieutenant Colonel Keith F. Adamson and Navy Commander Gilbert C. Hoover. Roosevelt summed up the conversation as: [...] "Alex, what you are after is to see that the Nazis don't blow us up." ...|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{laid the}} groundwork for his {{overture}} to China before he became president, writing in Foreign Affairs a year before his election: [...] "There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation." [...] Assisting him in this venture was his National Security Advisor and future Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, with whom the President worked closely, bypassing Cabinet officials. With relations between the Soviet Union and China at a nadirâ€”border clashes between the two took place during Nixon's first year in officeâ€”Nixon sent private word to the Chinese that he desired closer relations. A breakthrough came in early 1971, when Chairman Mao invited a team of American table tennis players to visit China and play against top Chinese players. Nixon followed up by sending Kissinger to China for clandestine meetings with Chinese officials. On July 15, 1971, it was simultaneously announced by Beijing and by Nixon (on television and radio) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> visit China the following February. The announcements astounded the world. The secrecy allowed both sets of leaders time to prepare the political climate in their countries for the contact.|$|E

500|$|At the Milburn House, McKinley {{seemed to}} be recovering. [...] On Saturday, September 7, McKinley was relaxed and conversational. [...] His wife was allowed to see him, as was Cortelyou; the President asked his secretary, [...] "How did they like my speech?" [...] and was pleased on hearing of {{positive}} reactions. [...] Meanwhile, Vice President Roosevelt (who had been in Vermont), much of the Cabinet, and Senator Hanna hurried to Buffalo. [...] Cortelyou continued to issue encouraging bulletins. [...] The President was permitted few visitors, and complained of loneliness. [...] As the crisis seemed to have passed, dignitaries started to leave on September 9, confident of the President's recovery. [...] Roosevelt left for a vacation in the Adirondack Mountains after expressing outrage that Czolgosz might serve {{only a few years}} under New York State law for attempted murder, the maximum penalty for attempted murder in New York at that time being ten years. [...] Attorney General Philander Knox went to Washington, searching for a means to bring Czolgosz under federal law. [...] Secretary of State John Hay had been closely associated with the two presidents to be assassinated: [...] he had been Lincoln's secretary, and a close friend of James Garfield. [...] He arrived on September 10; met at the station by Babcock with an account of the President's recovery, Hay responded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> die.|$|E
500|$|In late August, Augusta Saint-Gaudens sent {{new models}} for the eagle to Acting Director Preston. [...] When Barber {{examined}} them, he noted, [...] "dies made from these models {{would be a great}} improvement over those already made" [...] and stated that with these models, the Mint could have the eagle in full production within a month. [...] Homer Saint-Gaudens, the sculptor's son, wrote to Preston, [...] "Mr. Hering has finally finished the eagle at a relief slightly lower than that on the French [...] coin by Chaplin, [...] which is the lowest relief that Mr. Hering knew my father would abide by, and which I understand Mr. Barber can mint." [...] In the meantime, Cortelyou ordered 500 pieces struck on the Mint's high-pressure medal press from the dies the Mint had from Saint-Gaudens's earlier efforts, thus complying with the letter of the President's August 7 order. [...] Preston sent a note to Norris, warning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> likely order 100pieces and suggesting that he have the coins available [...] "so you can furnish them without a moment's delay". [...] According to numismatic historian Roger Burdette, [...] "these were an 'insurance policy', put in place by Cortelyou against additional presidential rage". [...] The President viewed sample eagle coins on August 31, and expressed his satisfaction with them and his desire to see more struck.|$|E

50|$|Supporters of <b>the</b> model argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{appointed}} <b>President</b> <b>would</b> {{carry out}} his or her duties in a very similar fashion to the current Governor-General, as the method of appointment requires the combined support of the major political parties. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>would</b> continue {{to act on the}} advice of the Prime Minister, as to do otherwise would invite dismissal. Consequently, the change to a republic is argued to have minimal impact on the rest of Australia's parliament and government.|$|R
