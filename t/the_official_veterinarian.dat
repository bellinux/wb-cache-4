30|$|Approximately, 27.3 % of {{the farmers}} who {{consigned}} these animals for slaughter were ignorant {{of the fact that}} the cows were actually pregnant but only 21.8 % {{of the farmers}} were aware of the physiological status of these cows. At least 6 % of the culled cows were “discarded” for fertility reasons when they were actually pregnant. Otherwise known as euthanasia, few authors have indicated that emergency slaughter may be an exceptional situation that might necessitate slaughtering pregnant animals (Grandin 1994; Butterworth, 2000; Biggs and Blackwell 2005). When emergency slaughter remains the only alternative, it is expected that the farmer contact the slaughter operators and <b>the</b> <b>Official</b> <b>Veterinarian</b> must rather be present during the ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection to declare the meat either fit or unfit for human consumption (Gregory and Grandin 2007).

40|$|Meat {{inspection}} now {{incorporates a}} more risk-based approach for protecting human health against meat-borne biological hazards. Official post-mortem meat inspection of pigs {{has shifted to}} visual meat inspection. <b>The</b> <b>official</b> <b>veterinarian</b> decides on additional post-mortem inspection procedures, such as incisions and palpations. The decision is based on declarations in the food chain information (FCI), antemortem inspection and post-mortem inspection. However, a smooth slaughter and inspection process is essential. Therefore, one {{should be able to}} assess prior to slaughter which pigs are suitable for visual meat inspection only, and which need more profound inspection procedures. This study evaluates the usability of the FCI provided by pig producers and considered the possibility for risk ranking of incoming slaughter batches according to the previous meat inspection data and the current FCI. Eighty-five slaughter batches comprising 8954 fattening pigs were randomly selected at a slaughterhouse that receives animals from across Finland. The mortality rate, the FCI and the meat inspection results for each batch were obtained. The current FCI alone provided insufficient and inaccurate information for risk ranking purposes for meat inspection. The partial condemnation rate for a batch was best predicted by the partial condemnation rate calculated for all the pigs sent for slaughter from the same holding in the previous year (p < 0. 001) and by prior information on cough declared in the current FCI (p = 0. 02) statement. Training and information to producers are needed to make the FCI reporting procedures more accurate. Historical meat inspection data on pigs slaughtered from the same holdings and well-chosen symptoms/signs for reporting, {{should be included in the}} FCI to facilitate the allocation of pigs for visual inspection. The introduced simple scoring system can be easily used for additional information for directing batches to appropriate meat inspection procedures. To control the main biological public health hazards related to pork, serological surveillance should be done and the information obtained from analyses should be used as part of the FCI.

40|$|Red {{meat and}} poultry meat is subject of {{legislation}} presented in Annex IV of Regulation 852 / 2004 /EEC. Regulation is based on principle of individual examination and if necessary, palpation and incision of lymph nodes, offal and where necessary carcass from slaughtered animals at the slaughter line. Potentially pathogenic agents present on the carcass and offal through physical contact (palpation and incision) are source for contamination of the palms and equipment of meat examiner that pose risk for cross contamination. <b>The</b> role of <b>official</b> <b>veterinarian</b> (OV) in transfer of contaminants is extremely important, having in mind that during his work he manipulates with large number of offal and carcasses. To estimate the role of OV in carcass contamination during meat examination {{in this study we}} use 12 cattle and 18 sheep sets of organs and afterwards we inoculate them with two laboratory marker microorganisms E. coli K 12 and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Offal were divided in groups composed from 6 samples and they were numerated. Examination of the offal is performed from sample number 1 to sample 6 using three different procedures: 1) without washing of hands and knife sanitation between each sample; 2) with washing of hands and without sanitation of the knife between each individual sample; 3) with washing of the hands between each individual sample. After that from each set of offal the number of marker microorganisms were determined and swabs were taken from the equipment that have been used in examination and surface of the hands of OV before and after the examination. From achieved number of marker microorganisms it can be noticed that in procedure where sanitation is not performed there is highest transfer of contamination marker microorganisms, while in procedure where sanitation is performed transfer of contamination have been disrupted and isn’t going further.

These settings include county or state fairs, petting zoos, animal swap meets, pet stores, zoologic institutions, circuses, farm tours, livestock birthing exhibits, educational exhibits at schools, and wildlife photo opportunities. Although there are many positive benefits of human-animal contact, infectious diseases, injuries, and allergic reactions acquired by people in these settings are increasingly reported. Infectious disease outbreaks reported during the last decade include Escherichia coli O 157 enteritis among schoolchildren following visits to farms and petting zoos, salmonellosis in children who attended a reptile exhibit, Coxiella burnetii infections among shopping mall patrons attending an animal birthing exhibit, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections in zoo elephant handlers, and ringworm in persons showing lambs.

40|$|International audience(.) {{subspecies}} serovar Choleraesuis, the swine-adapted serovar {{is found}} rarely in Western European countries including Germany. However, the regional laboratory {{of the federal}} state Thuringia in Germany examined diseased wild boars routinely also for the occurrence of organisms. Between 2006 and 2008, only the serovar Choleraesuis was islolated from 24 animals, three strains isolated from domestic pigs were included. In order to detect a possible epidemiological context, the strains of Choleraesuis were characterised by macrorestriction and plasmid analysis, repetitive sequence PCR, antimicrobial testing and determining the biochemical profile. A combination of all methods enabled the identification of five epidemiological groups. Two groups were detected in the same territory but three other discriminative groups were predominant in different regions. Choleraesuis strains of the different epidemiological groups circulate in wild boar populations in the corresponding regions. However, it could be concluded that both natural barriers like mountains and artificial barriers like arterial roads may cause the separation of wild boar populations {{and as a result}} also the respective Choleraesuis organisms. The occurrence of the identical epidemiological groups in wild boars and domestic pigs indicates the possible mutual exposure of the pathogen.
