5|$|The most {{stringent}} {{tests are}} reserved for drugs and foodstuffs. For these, a number of tests are performed, lasting {{less than a month}} (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and reproductive problems. The cost of the full complement of <b>tests</b> <b>is</b> several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete.|$|E
30|$|The Mann–Whitney U <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used {{to compare}} {{continuous}} variables between two groups, and Fisher’s exact <b>test</b> <b>was</b> {{used to compare}} dichotomous variables between two groups. The Mantel–Haenszel χ 2 <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used for comparisons between two groups involving ordered categorical variables, and the χ 2 <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used to compare groups involving non-ordered categorical variables. Correlations were analyzed with Spearman’s rank correlation. All <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> two-tailed and conducted at the 5 % significance level. Wilcoxon signed-rank <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used when comparing two related samples.|$|R
50|$|While monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} {{treated the}} same as fuzz testing and the two terms are usually used together, some believe they are different by arguing that monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> more about random actions while fuzz <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> more about random data input. Monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> also different from ad-hoc testing in that ad-hoc <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> performed without planning and documentation and the objective of ad-hoc <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> to divide the system randomly into subparts and check their functionality, {{which is not the}} case in monkey testing.|$|R
30|$|In general terms, a {{positive}} likelihood ratio {{of more than}} 10 indicates that a <b>test</b> <b>is</b> good at confirming disease if the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> positive and a negative likelihood ratio of less than 0.1 indicates that the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> good at excluding disease when the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> negative.|$|R
5|$|The gold {{standard}} test for biliary obstruction is still {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). This {{involves the use of}} endoscopy (passing a tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and thence to the duodenum) to pass a small cannula into the bile duct. At that point, radiocontrast is injected to opacify the duct, and X-rays are taken to get a visual impression of the biliary system. On the endoscopic image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted gallstone in the common bile duct or the frank extrusion of pus from the common bile duct orifice. On the X-ray images (known as cholangiograms), gallstones are visible as non-opacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in critically ill patients in whom delay for diagnostic <b>tests</b> <b>is</b> not acceptable; however, if the index of suspicion for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed common bile duct.|$|E
25|$|The {{calcitonin}} {{doubling time}} was a better predictor of MTC survival than CEA but following both <b>tests</b> <b>is</b> recommended.|$|E

5000|$|Confirmatory <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> the <b>tests</b> {{required}} {{to confirm the}} analysis. Confirmatory tests cost more than simpler presumptive tests so presumptive <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> often done to see if confirmatory <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> necessary.|$|R
50|$|The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> finally produced. Trial {{questions}} are included and various {{versions of the}} <b>test</b> <b>are</b> prepared to avoid cheating. The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> printed in booklets that include test instructions and test items.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{reliability}} <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> {{the focus}} in the research of reliability testing at present. The basic concepts of reliability <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> introduced. Names of reliability <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> sorted. Characteristics of mechanical reliability <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> discussed. The key issues of mechanical reliability testing and its development are then reviewed. Finally, some possible fields in the research are summarized...|$|R
25|$|The DNA {{test report}} in other family {{relationship}} tests, such as grandparentage and siblingship <b>tests,</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to a}} paternity test report. Instead of the Combined Paternity Index, a different value, such as a Siblingship Index, is reported.|$|E
25|$|His highest Test {{score was}} 275 {{which was a}} South African record at the time (as of 2012 the highest score by a South African in <b>tests</b> <b>is</b> 311 not out by Hashim Amla versus England).|$|E
25|$|The {{ratio of}} false positives (identifying an {{innocent}} traveller as a terrorist) to true positives (detecting a would-be terrorist) is, therefore, very high; and because almost every alarm {{is a false}} positive, the positive predictive value of these screening <b>tests</b> <b>is</b> very low.|$|E
30|$|Qualitative {{phytochemical}} <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> {{carried out}} for the identification of alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, saponins, tannin, gums, and terpenoids in the samples [12]. Alkaloids were detected using the Dragendroff’s, Mayer’s, Hager’s and Wagner’s tests. Lead acetate, alkaline reagent, ferric chloride and ammonia <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> used for detection of flavonoids. Legal’s test, Molisch, Keller-Kiliani and Borntrager’s <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> performed to identify glycosides. For identification of tannin potassium dichromate test, ferric chloride, potassium hydroxide and lead acetate <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> followed. Salkowski <b>test</b> and froth <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used to detect the presence of terpenoids and for saponins respectively. Molisch <b>test</b> <b>was</b> performed for detecting the existence of gum in the samples.|$|R
50|$|A <b>test</b> tube <b>is</b> {{filled with}} {{distilled}} water and acetic acid is added. To this mixture one drop of the effusion to <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> <b>is</b> added. If the drop dissipates, the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> negative, indicating a transudate. If the drop precipitates, the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> positive, indicating an exudate.|$|R
30|$|The Pearson Chi Square {{test and}} Fisher’s exact <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for {{comparisons}} of the categorical variables. The Mann–Whitney U test and Wilcoxon Signed rank <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for the comparison of the two groups. Kruskal–Wallis, One way Anova, and Welch <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for the comparison {{of more than two}} groups. Spearman’s Rho <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used to analyze correlations among the variables.|$|R
25|$|There {{have been}} {{concerns}} {{about the safety of}} aprotinin. Anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) occurs at a rate of 1:200 in first-time use, but serology (measuring antibodies against aprotinin in the blood) is not carried out in practice to predict anaphylaxis risk because the correct interpretation of these <b>tests</b> <b>is</b> difficult.|$|E
25|$|The Pumas use {{a variety}} of stadiums when playing at home. One of the most {{frequently}} used for <b>tests</b> <b>is</b> Estadio José Amalfitani, home of Club Atlético Vélez Sársfield and sited in Buenos Aires. When Great Britain first came to Argentina in the 1910 tour, the national team played at Polo Ground of Flores among other stadiums.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, and a dry mouth. Serious side effects can include liver {{problems}} and regular monitoring of liver function <b>tests</b> <b>is</b> therefore recommended. Other serious risks include pancreatitis {{and an increased}} suicide risk. It is known to cause serious abnormalities in the baby if taken during pregnancy. Because of this it is not typically recommended in {{women of childbearing age}} who have migraines.|$|E
50|$|The frontal <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> {{performed}} at 64 km/h into an offset deformable barrier. This {{is designed to}} represent an impact with a vehicle of similar mass and structure as the car itself.The side impact <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> {{performed at}} 50 km/h, but the side impact pole <b>test</b> <b>is</b> performed at 32 km/h. The pedestrian safety <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> performed at 40 km/h.|$|R
30|$|Pearson’s χ 2 <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used {{to perform}} {{categorical}} analysis, and Spearman’s correlation <b>test</b> <b>was</b> {{used to determine}} correlations. For further evaluations, univariate analysis of variance, the paired t-test, the Kruskall–Wallis test and the Mann–Whitney-U <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> used.|$|R
50|$|The Mann-Whitney U test / Wilcoxon rank-sum <b>test</b> <b>is</b> not {{the same}} as the Wilcoxon signed-rank <b>test,</b> {{although}} both <b>are</b> nonparametric and involve summation of ranks. The Mann-Whitney U <b>test</b> <b>is</b> applied to independent samples. The Wilcoxon signed-rank <b>test</b> <b>is</b> applied to matched or dependent samples.|$|R
25|$|There {{are various}} methods to {{determine}} whether a given number n is prime. The most basic routine, trial division, is of little practical use because of its slowness. One group of modern primality <b>tests</b> <b>is</b> applicable to arbitrary numbers, while more efficient tests are available for particular numbers. Most such methods only tell whether n is prime or not. Routines also yielding one (or all) prime factors of n are called factorization algorithms.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of blood}} test panels may help in diagnosis. The OVA1 panel {{includes}} CA-125, beta-2 microglobulin, transferrin, apolipoprotein A1, and transthyretin. OVA1 above 5.0 in premenopausal people and 4.4 in postmenopausal people indicates {{a high risk}} for cancer. A different set of laboratory <b>tests</b> <b>is</b> used for detecting sex cord-stromal tumors. High levels of testosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, combined with other symptoms {{and high levels of}} inhibin A and inhibin B can be indicative of an SCST of any type.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{neurophysiology}} {{is concerned}} with testing the physiology or function of the central and peripheral aspects of the nervous system. These kinds of tests {{can be divided into}} recordings of: (1) spontaneous or continuously running electrical activity, or (2) stimulus evoked responses. Subspecialties include electroencephalography, electromyography, evoked potential, nerve conduction study and polysomnography. Sometimes these tests are performed by techs without a medical degree, but the interpretation of these <b>tests</b> <b>is</b> done by a medical professional.|$|E
50|$|Copy <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> <b>testing</b> that evaluates {{advertising}} copy and creative executions. In this section, the principal methods of copy <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> briefly discussed.|$|R
30|$|The island {{partition}} {{result is}} not feasible if the DER dispatch test or the power flow <b>test</b> <b>is</b> not passed. Model modification and adjustment strategies {{corresponding to the}} <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> given in this section. Firstly, the cases that fail the DER dispatch <b>test</b> <b>are</b> analyzed and modification of the constraint set is proposed. Secondly, adjustment strategies based on the power flow <b>test</b> <b>are</b> given.|$|R
50|$|Automated <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> {{advantageous}} for {{a number}} of reasons: <b>tests</b> may <b>be</b> executed continuously without the need for human intervention, they are easily repeatable, and often faster. Automated <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> useful in situations where the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> to be executed several times, for example as part of regression testing. Automated <b>tests</b> can <b>be</b> disadvantageous when poorly written, leading to incorrect testing or broken tests being carried out.|$|R
25|$|In IQ and Global Inequality Lynn and Vanhanen {{argue that}} intelligence, as {{measured}} by IQ <b>tests,</b> <b>is</b> {{a major contributor to}} national wealth as well as to various measures of social well-being. They base this argument on the finding that nations' average IQs have a strong correlation with several such factors, among them adult literacy (0.64), tertiary education (0.75), life expectancy (0.77), and democratization (0.57). The book is a follow-up to Lynn and Vanhanen's 2002 book IQ and the Wealth of Nations, and expands on many of the ideas presented in their earlier book.|$|E
25|$|When any {{of these}} <b>tests</b> <b>is</b> positive, CT {{scanning}} of the adrenal gland and MRI of the pituitary gland are performed to detect the presence of any adrenal or pituitary adenomas or incidentalomas (the incidental discovery of harmless lesions). Scintigraphy of the adrenal gland with iodocholesterol scan is occasionally necessary. Occasionally, determining the ACTH levels in various veins in the body by venous catheterization, working towards the pituitary (petrosal sinus sampling) is necessary. In many cases, the tumors causing Cushing's disease are less than 2mm in size and difficult to detect using MRI or CT imaging. In one study of 261 patients with confirmed pituitary Cushing's disease, only 48% of pituitary lesions were identified using MRI prior to surgery.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{favourable}} {{findings of}} Schutz, Kranich and Agnello, the hornblende ore from Baffin Island contained no gold, {{and it was}} later alleged by Robert Denham, who had assisted Kranich with his tests, that Kranich had added gold and silver coins of his own to bring the projected value of the refined ore to £50 per ton. The story that Kranich allegedly doctored the assay <b>tests</b> <b>is</b> found in a deposition to the Privy Council by Michael Lok; in the deposition Lok claims that the evidence of Kranich's fraud was presented to Lord Burghley at his house in the Strand {{in the presence of}} Lok, Sir Walter Mildmay, and all the Commissioners involved in supervising the Frobisher expeditions.|$|E
40|$|The multisample {{version of}} the Cucconi rank test for the two-sample location-scale problem is proposed. Even though little known, the Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> of {{interest}} for several reasons. The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> compared with some Lepage-type <b>tests.</b> It <b>is</b> shown that the multisample Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> slightly {{more powerful than the}} multisample Lepage test. Moreover, its <b>test</b> statistic can <b>be</b> computed analytically whereas several others cannot. A practical application example in experimental nutrition is presented. An R function to perform the multisample Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> given...|$|R
40|$|Task 3 {{experimental}} <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> concluded this quarter. Second-stage {{testing of}} first-stage distilled filtrates {{and of a}} Wilsonville resid from Run 263 were completed. The first-stage filtrates {{were found to have}} higher reactivity than the Wilsonville material. Task 4 experimental <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> initiated. First-stage microautoclave <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> made at reduced catalyst loading and reduced solvent to coal ratio without negatively affecting coal conversion. Lower severity second-stage catalytic upgrading <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> begun. The single-pass resid conversion obtained in the first completed second-stage <b>test</b> <b>was</b> high (67 - 69 %) ...|$|R
50|$|In {{time series}} analysis, two {{well-known}} {{versions of a}} portmanteau <b>test</b> <b>are</b> available for <b>testing</b> for autocorrelation in the residuals of a model: it tests whether any {{of a group of}} autocorrelations of the residual time series are different from zero. This <b>test</b> <b>is</b> the Ljung-Box <b>test,</b> which <b>is</b> an improved version of the Box-Pierce <b>test,</b> having <b>been</b> devised at essentially the same time; a seemingly trivial simplification (omitted in the improved <b>test)</b> <b>was</b> found to have a deleterious effect. This portmanteau <b>test</b> <b>is</b> useful in working with ARIMA models.|$|R
