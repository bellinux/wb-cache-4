Tribulation is Treasure {{in the nature of}} it, but it is not currant money in the use of it, except wee get nearer and nearer our home, Heaven, by it.

500|$|Sheila gives Berger {{a yellow}} shirt. He goofs around {{and ends up}} tearing it in two. [...] Sheila voices her {{distress}} that Berger seems to care more about the [...] "bleeding crowd" [...] than about her ("Easy to Be Hard"). [...] Jeanie summarizes everyone's romantic entanglements: [...] "I'm hung up on Claude, Sheila's hung up on Berger, Berger is hung up everywhere. Claude is hung up on a cross over Sheila and Berger." [...] The tribe runs out to the audience with fliers inviting them to a Be-In. [...] Berger, Woof and another tribe member pay satiric tribute to the American flag as they fold it ("Don't Put it Down"). [...] After young and innocent Crissy describes [...] "Frank Mills", a boy she's looking for, the tribe participates in the [...] "Be-In". [...] The men of the tribe burn their draft cards. [...] Claude puts his card in the fire, then changes his mind and pulls it out. [...] He asks, [...] "where is the something, where is the someone, <b>that</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> why I live and die?" [...] ("Where Do I Go"). [...] The tribe emerges naked, intoning [...] "beads, flowers, freedom, happiness." ...|$|E
500|$|However, as is {{most often}} the case with film adaptations, {{differences}} do exist between the film and source material. Certain scenes from the book were cut from the film, such as a biology room scene where Bella's class does blood typing. Hardwicke explains, [...] "Well [...] almost 500 pages—you do have to do the sweetened condensed milk version of that.... We already have two scenes in biology: the first time they're in there and then the second time when they connect. For a film, when you condense, you don't want to keep going back to the same setting over and over. So that's not in there." [...] The settings of certain conversations in the book were also changed to make the scenes more [...] "visually dynamic" [...] on-screen, such as Bella's revelation that she knows Edward is a vampire—this happens in a meadow in the film instead of in Edward's car as in the novel. A biology field trip scene is added to the film to condense the moments of Bella's frustration at trying to explain how Edward saved her from being crushed by a van. The villainous vampires are introduced earlier in the film than in the novel. Rosenberg said that [...] "you don't really see James and the other villains until to {{the last quarter of the}} book, which really won't work for a movie. You need that ominous tension right off the bat. We needed to see them and that impending danger from the start. And so I had to create back story for them, what they were up to, to flesh them out a bit as characters." [...] Rosenberg also combined some of the human high school students, with Lauren Mallory and Jessica Stanley in the novel becoming the character of Jessica in the film, and a [...] "compilation of a couple of different human characters" [...] becoming Eric Yorkie. About these variances from the book, Mooradian stated, [...] "I think we did a really judicious job of distilling [...] Our greatest critic, Stephenie Meyer, loves the screenplay, and <b>that</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> that we made all the right choices in terms of what to keep and what to lose. Invariably, you're going to lose bits and pieces that certain members of the audience are going to desperately want to see, but there's just a reality that we're not making 'Twilight: The Book' the movie." ...|$|E

On November 8, against , Ringer had 32 carries for 121yards (a 3.8 average) with 2 touchdowns. Purdue coach Joe Tiller said of Ringer after the game, [...] "I don't {{know if he}} gets {{stronger}} or if the opponent just begins to wear down.

2500|$|Professor {{of journalism}} at Elon University, Michael Skube, argued in the editorial, [...] "The No. 1 reason to rank colleges," [...] against {{arguments}} {{made in the}} 11 March Washington Post article, [...] "The Cost of Bucking College Rankings" [...] by the President of Sarah Lawrence College, Michele Tolela Myers. Skube states that, while having some merit, these arguments were [...] "partly beside the point [...] U.S. News survey, for all its imperfections, performs the useful service of comparing apples with academic apples.In some ways, one might even argue that its nuts-and-bolts consumer information {{is at least as}} practical as the bar charts and numbers a car buyer might find in Consumer Reports or Car and Driver. What factors go into the rankings? Student retention accounts for 25% at schools U.S. News calls master's level and those that provide primarily the bachelor's degree (called 'comprehensive' schools, oddly enough)." [...] Skube also notes objections made to the reputation survey portion of the U.S. News survey and responds by stating that, [...] "one can see why." [...] However, he argues, [...] "sometimes just the facts will do, and the U.S. News manual offers them in great heaps [...] Sarah Lawrence, for example, does not take into consideration SAT or ACT scores. Don't even send 'em, it tells high school students. <b>That</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> all I need to know about Sarah Lawrence. It tells me that Sarah Lawrence doesn't take aptitude as seriously as I'd like. The university depends far more on high school grades, which, as anyone who has taught at the college level knows, cannot be trusted. If last year's freshman classes at several colleges all had composite high school grade point averages of 3.6 to 3.8, I don't know how the intellectual caliber of one differs from another. But if one college attracted high school students whose SATs averaged 1100 to 1200, and another attracted students with SATs averaging 1300 to 1400, I know the latter is more selective. Sarah Lawrence might not care about such things, but I do." ...|$|E
