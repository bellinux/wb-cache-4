500|$|On {{the evening}} of April 4, 1958, after the Oscar {{telecast}} which she had attended without him, Stompanato arrived at Turner's rented house at 730 North Bedford Drive in Beverly Hills. The two began arguing heatedly in the bedroom, during which Stompanato threatened to kill Turner, her daughter, and her mother. Fearing that her mother's life was in danger, Turner's fourteen-year-old daughter, Cheryl, grabbed a kitchen knife and ran to Turner's defense. According to testimony provided by Turner at the coroner's inquest, Cheryl, who had {{been listening to the}} couple's fight behind <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> <b>door,</b> stabbed Stompanato in the stomach when Turner attempted to usher him out of the bedroom. [...] " [...] I thought [...] hit him in the stomach," [...] Turner testified in court. The killing was ultimately deemed a justifiable homicide.|$|E
500|$|President Obama {{was visiting}} Australia and Indonesia when the {{discovery}} was made. Michelle Obama {{had returned to}} the White House on the morning of November 15, going to sleep shortly after arriving. An usher went to check on her later that day and began talking about the shooting, assuming she already knew about the incident. According to Leonnig, the first lady was [...] "furious", wondering why the director of the Secret Service, Mark J. Sullivan, who had accompanied her on her flight back to Washington, had not told her about it. Leonnig also stated that Sullivan was subsequently summoned to a meeting with the first lady, during which she [...] raised her voice so loudly she could be heard through <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> <b>door.</b> Sullivan disputes this report, though he declined to give any details regarding the conversation. A detailed inspection of the White House for evidence or damage and interviews with key witnesses began later that afternoon. Leonnig also stated that president Obama was angered over the flawed response and the failure to notify the first lady. According to one presidential aide, [...] "the shit really hit the fan" [...] when Obama returned from his travels five days later.|$|E

2500|$|Feldhendler {{was among}} those who survived the war, hiding in Lublin until the end of German occupation. The city was taken by the Soviet Red Army on 24 July 1944, and became the {{temporary}} headquarters of the Soviet-controlled communist Polish Committee of National Liberation established by Joseph Stalin. However, on 2 April 1945, Feldhendler was shot through <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> <b>door</b> of his flat as he got up to investigate a commotion in an outer room. [...] Feldhendler and his wife managed to escape through another door and made their way to Lublin's Św. Wincentego á Paulo hospital, where he underwent surgery but died four days later. [...] According to most of the older publications, Feldhendler was killed by right-wing Polish nationalists, sometimes identified as the Narodowe Siły Zbrojne, an anti-Communist and anti-Semitic partisan unit (name unknown). [...] However, more recent inquiries, citing the incomplete treatment of the event by earlier historians, and the scant documentary record, have called into question this version of events.|$|E
