However, Hoskins' social skills never developed properly, and he felt alienated by all around him. He feared mankind will die out if they stayed on earth, becoming extinct like the dinosaurs. Hoskins was inspired to develop a robotic model for military application that consisted of an inhuman head attached to spidery legs. Dubbed a [...] "headman", it could decapitate enemy soldiers in the field and reanimate their bodies to act as cannon fodder for its controllers. Those in scientific circles, including John Henry Irons, were unaware of the robot moving beyond the <b>theoretical</b> <b>stage.</b> Later, Hoskins body was discovered, his head detached by a laser, and his brain missing entirely. In a powerful new bipedal shell, Hoskins renamed himself [...] "the Headmaster", and set his master plan into motion. He re-purposed a former NORAD installation, dubbed the Ark, and designed as a nuclear bomb shelter. From here, the Headmaster set to work on a massive spaceship that could carry the finest examples of humanity off their home planet. In need of a work force to carry out the task, the Headmaster created an army of headmen. He then sent them out to kill and commandeer the bodies of homeless people to construct his craft. The murders of two police officers, who stumbled upon one of Headmaster's victims under the control of a headman, attracted the attention of private investigator John Jones—secretly the Manhunter from Mars. Using his shapeshifting abilities to assume the visage of a derelict, J'Onn J'Onzz staked out an alley until he was attacked by a headman. After being wounded in a struggle with the device, the Martian Manhunter took its remains to the JLA Watchtower for further study. With the aid of Steel and Oracle, the Manhunter located the Ark and its contents. The Headmaster met with J'Onzz, hoping to convince him of the merits of his plan, so that he would not lose precious time by abandoning the base. Dedicated to the preservation of all life, equally treasured, the Manhunter from Mars declared himself the Headmaster's implacable foe. A scuffle ensued, which ended with the Martian Manhunter burying the Headmaster under his own space ship. The damage Headmaster took deactivated his headman, and pieces of his robotic armor were uncovered after an explosion leveled the Ark. It is unclear whether Hoskins' brain was still within the Headmaster body, or if he is perhaps still at large.

Until now, continuous extraction with more than ten multiple <b>theoretical</b> <b>stages</b> has been demonstrated by a single centrifugal extractor {{in the case of}} single specie (zinc extraction with di(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D 2 EHPA)). In the present study, the centrifugal extraction system has been applied to a multispecies case to clarify the separation behavior by countercurrent Taylor mixing. The extraction behaviors of lanthanides (Sm and Eu) with D 2 EHPA were compared among batch equilibrium measurements, rate measurements by a constant-interfacial-area cell and the continuous experiments by the centrifugal extractor. In the continuous experiment, the separation factor (SF = DEu/DSm) became more than tripled in comparison with the batch equilibrium value due to the multistage extraction effect caused by the countercurrent contact of aqueous/organic phases. The number of <b>theoretical</b> <b>stages</b> of our extractor was evaluated to be 8 to 9 in terms of DEu and 4 to 5 in terms of SF at the rotation speed of 1400 rpm. The SF value from the rate measurement data (SFnoneq; SF in non-equilibrium state) was slightly lower than the batch extraction data (SFeq; SF in equilibrium state) which resulted in difference between <b>theoretical</b> <b>stages</b> evaluated from DEu,eq and SFeq. Although this would slightly decrease the separation efficiency by the continuous extraction, the countercurrent multistage effect was still dominant.

40|$|A semicontinuous {{fractionation}} {{process of}} fish oil ethyl esters {{was carried out}} in this work by means of supercritical carbon dioxide. The process focused on the separation of ethyl esters on chain length basis. Experimental temperature ranged from 42 to 70 degrees C, whereas pressure ranged from 10. 1 to 17. 2 MPa. Optimal operating conditions were found for solvent density in the range 570 - 595 kg/m(3). A thermodynamic model based on the Peng-Robinson equation of state, proposed to represent high-pressure phase equilibria for this complex system, was validated on the experimental data. The model assumes that the multicomponent natural mixture can be considered as composed of five major components, defined on chain length basis. The proposed thermodynamic model was then used in the modellization of a continuous multistage fractionation process. The continuous process simulations that were carried out allowed to investigate the effect of number of <b>theoretical</b> <b>stages,</b> reflux ratio and solvent to feed ratio on the distribution of the components between extract and raffinate. A case study was considered, in order to find out process operating conditions to attain 95 % by weight of heavy components (acid chain length 20 and 22) in the raffinate together with a 95 % recovery.
