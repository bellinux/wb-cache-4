40|$|The study {{investigated}} the factors precipitating insomnia as perceived by low cadre company workers in Nigeria. A total of 200 workers from Nigerian bottling company Owerri in Imo State and Abia State, aged 26 - 55 years participated in the study. From the sampled population of 200 participants representing equal number {{of males and females}} were drawn through systematic random sampling for analysis.

Contributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the accident were encounters with wind shear, downdrafts, and turbulence during the climb.

The latter assault, led by Ana Ipătescu, resulted in the arrest of all coup leaders.|$|E

40|$|In my paper, I {{analyze the}} meaning of tense-aspect forms of Russian causative verbs, such as zastavit' 'make' and pozvolit' 'let'. I show that the {{situation}} is different, depending on whether the causer is an agent or an event. In constructions with an agentive causer the tense-aspect characteristics refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> whole event or only <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>causing</b> event, making <b>the</b> causative construction similar to other biverbal constructions. In contrast, if the causer is an event, this can yield an interesting semantic effect, making <b>the</b> tense refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>caused</b> event only. In fact, the crucial thing is that the tense also refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>caused</b> event, but not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> event in the narrow sense, rather to its result. This posits a problem which has not been accounted for in the literature on grammatical marking of causatives...|$|R

5|$|Accounts differ as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of death; {{one version}} {{stated that he}} died by poison only and another view claimed he died by a self-inflicted gunshot while biting down on a cyanide capsule. Contemporary historians have {{rejected}} these accounts as being either Soviet propaganda or an attempted compromise in order to reconcile the different conclusions. One eyewitness stated that Hitler's corpse showed signs of having been shot through the mouth, but this has been proven unlikely. There is also controversy regarding the authenticity of skull and jaw fragments that were recovered. In 2009, American researchers performed DNA tests on a skull that Soviet officials had long believed {{to be that of}} Hitler. The tests and examination revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman less than 40 years old. The recovered jaw fragments were not tested.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{followed}} the usual course {{of reading the}} law {{in order to obtain}} his license to practice. In 1756, he became an apprentice in the office of John Putnam, a leading lawyer in Worcester. In 1758, he earned an A.M. from Harvard, and the following year was admitted to the Massachusetts bar, having completed his studies under Putnam. From an early age, he developed the habit of writing descriptions of events and impressions of men which are scattered through his diary, which included his report of the 1761 argument of James Otis Jr. in the Massachusetts Superior Court as to the legality of Writs of Assistance. Otis's argument inspired Adams <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the American colonies.|$|E

As J-FLAG's representative, he argued in favour of LGBT rights during appearances on Jamaican television and radio programs. This attracted great hostility within Jamaica – a country with particularly high rates of anti-gay prejudice – with J-FLAG members receiving death threats and Williamson surviving a knife attack. For a time he left Jamaica, living in Canada and England for several years, before returning to Kingston in 2002.|$|E
