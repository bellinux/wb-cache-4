5|$|By the 15th century, English {{was back}} in fashion among all classes, though much changed; the Middle English form showed many signs of French influence, both in {{vocabulary}} and spelling. During the English Renaissance, many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins. Modern English has extended this custom of flexibility, {{when it comes to}} incorporating words from different languages. <b>Thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> to the British Empire, the English language is the world's unofficial lingua franca.|$|E
5|$|While details {{regarding}} Richard Cantillon's {{life are}} scarce, {{it is thought}} that he was born sometime during the 1680s in County Kerry, Ireland. He was son to land-owner Richard Cantillon of Ballyheigue. Sometime {{in the middle of the}} first decade of the 18th century Cantillon moved to France, where he attained French citizenship. By 1711, Cantillon found himself in the employment of British Paymaster General James Brydges, in Spain, where he organised payments to British prisoners of war during the War of Spanish Succession. Cantillon remained in Spain until 1714, cultivating a number of business and political connections, before returning to Paris. Cantillon then became involved in the banking industry working for a cousin, who at that time was lead-correspondent of the Parisian branch of a family bank. Two years later, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> to financial backing by James Brydges, Cantillon bought his cousin out and attained ownership of the bank. Given the financial and political connections Cantillon was able to attain both through his family and through James Brydges, Cantillon proved a fairly successful banker, specialising in money transfers between Paris and London.|$|E

50|$|The {{fluctuating}} {{performance of}} his army in 1643 was {{in contrast to the}} ascendancy of the Eastern Association. This was an alliance of pro-Parliament militiamen from Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire and Lincolnshire commanded by Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester. One of their cavalry commanders was Oliver Cromwell.

40|$|By {{highlighting}} {{the lack of}} rigorous evidence and calling for {{a greater understanding of}} the interaction of the two processes, a recent study [Nelson et al. (1997) ] has called into question the strong perception that poverty is both a consequence as well as a cause of resource degradation. This perception which is widely held is strongly evident in the writings of the multilateral development agencies such as the World Bank (1990) and IFAD (1992) and exists despite extensive reviews which indicate that the short- and long-term implications of land degradation are not very clear [see Scherr and Yadav (1995) ]. Similarly, while knowledge about poverty is expanding rapidly, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>parts</b> to the massive international focus and resources brought to bear on its understanding in the past ten years or so; the existing state of knowledge is still far from providing a comprehensive understanding of all the complex dimensions of its processes. The understanding of the interactions of poverty and land degradation is even less clear and limited. This paper reviews the existing knowledge about the relationship between poverty and land degradation and draws implications for research. ...|$|R

Along with the expansion of service and routes comes an increased amount of transit planning work. Regular transit planning duties include developing a Long Range Transit Plan, developing maps and statistical reports, updating Title VI documentation, and various other activities.|$|E
40|$|The eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) {{was nearly}} {{eliminated}} during the mid 1900 ’s by habitat destruction, competition, and other human-related disturbances. However, {{the past few}} decades have seen an unprecedented resurgence <b>in</b> bluebird numbers <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> <b>part</b> to the placement of bluebird nest boxes by concerned citizens. A study was conducted using geographic information system (GIS) technology to determine the optimal nest box locations for bluebirds in Minnesota by analyzing nest site selection in relation to the distance between nest boxes and elements of the landscape such as roads, buildings, water, trees, and other boxes. Thirty-five years worth of data of roughly 80 nest boxes from an existing study near Pierz, MN were provided by bluebird researchers Dave and Carol Fiedler of Buffalo, MN. Field work included marking the locations of the boxes with a global positioning system (GPS) as well as describing the landscape characteristics surrounding the box. Distances were measured using ortho-rectified aerial photographs with much of the display and analysis done using Arcview 3. 2 and ArcGIS. Each of the bluebird competitors was analyzed separately and then combined to develop buffer distances for ideal bluebird box placement...|$|R

25|$|The next {{attack on}} the English colonists took place at South Deerfield, in August of the same year. Throughout {{the rest of the}} 1675, the Native American forces had a string of victories, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> to {{skillful}} leadership of sachems like Metacomet, Muttawmp and Matoonas, who exploited their knowledge of local terrain to achieve surprise and often successfully ambushed colonial forces sent to track them down, much {{in the same way as}} happened in Wheeler's Surprise. However, 1675 ended with a significant defeat for the Native Americans, with the defeat of the Narragansetts in the Great Swamp Fight.|$|E

After Van Zandt's death his road manager, Harold Egger, released video and audio recordings from the songwriter's concerts.

25|$|Jacksonville's mostly {{conservative}} residents, however, {{objected to}} the hallmarks of the early movie industry, such as car chases in the streets, simulated bank robberies and fire alarms in public places, and even the occasional riot. In 1917, conservative Democrat John W. Martin was elected mayor on the platform of taming the city's movie industry. By that time, southern California was emerging as the major movie production center, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> to the move of film pioneers like William Selig and D.W. Griffith to the area. These factors quickly sealed the demise of Jacksonville as a major film destination.|$|E

Jordan won the scoring title for a fifth consecutive season, but the team was no longer a one-man show of years past. Instead, Jordan distributed the ball with regularity, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> to the triangle offense instituted by head coach Phil Jackson and assistant Tex Winter. This gave the Bulls additional offensive weapons to choose from, ranging from wingman Scottie Pippen and post players Horace Grant and Bill Cartwright to shooters such as John Paxson and B. J.

25|$|The {{national}} Republican Party was at {{that time}} going through a period of internal problems over their position on communism, {{and the best way to}} deal with the threatboth internally and externally.

Jenner was incensed not only by Craig's position on communism, but also on his campaign platform that advocated significant increased state spending and the start of a number of new programs. The difference between Craig and the party continued throughout his time in office. Craig's Democratic opponent was incumbent lieutenant governor John Watkins. <b>Thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> to Eisenhower's popularity, Craig won a landslide victory in the election.|$|E
25|$|As {{coordinator}} of shipbuilding, Robinson {{laid the groundwork}} for the dramatic expansion of the fleet under the two-ocean Navy program. Under Robinson, the time between contract plans and working plans was cut from between 15 and 18 months to less than a year, an efficiency achieved in part by Robinson's decision to freeze the designs of combat ships in each category in order to stop the endless engineering delays incurred by frequent design changes. He mustered legislative support by testifying some 50 times before Congressional committees to explain the Navy's materiel requirements, and mobilized industry resources by exhaustively surveying and reserving the nation's shipbuilding facilities. <b>Thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> to Robinson's careful preparation, when Congress appropriated the funds to expand the fleet by 70% in September 1940, the Navy awarded almost every contract within an hour after President Franklin D.
