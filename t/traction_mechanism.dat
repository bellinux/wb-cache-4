40|$|It is {{desirable}} for the studs of a soccer shoe {{to penetrate the}} sport surface and provide the player with sufficient traction when accelerating. Mechanical tests are often {{used to measure the}} traction of shoe–surface combinations. Mechanical testing offers a repeatable measure of shoe–surface traction, eliminating the inherent uncertainties that exist when human participant testing is employed, and are hence used to directly compare the performance of shoe–surface combinations. However, the influence specific surface characteristics has on traction is often overlooked. Examining the influence of surface characteristics on mechanical test results improves the understanding of the <b>traction</b> <b>mechanisms</b> at the shoe–surface interface. This allows footwear developers to make informed decisions on the design of studded outsoles. The aim {{of this paper is to}} understand the effect gravimetric moisture content has on the tribological mechanisms at play during stud–surface interaction. This study investigates the relationships between: the gravimetric moisture content of a natural sand-based soccer surface; surface stiffness measured via a bespoke impact test device; and surface traction measured via a bespoke mechanical test device. Regression analysis revealed that surface stiffness decreases linearly with increased gravimetric moisture content (p = 0. 04). Traction was found to initially increase and then decrease with gravimetric moisture content. It was observed that: a surface of low moisture content provides low stud penetration and therefore reduced traction; a surface of high moisture content provides high stud penetration but also reduced traction due to a lubricating effect; and surfaces with moisture content in between the two extremes provide increased traction. In this study a standard commercially available stud was used and other studs may provide slightly different results. The results provide insight into the <b>traction</b> <b>mechanisms</b> at the stud–surface interface which are described in the paper. The variation between traction measurements shows the influence gravimetric moisture content will have on player performance. This highlights the requirement to understand surface conditions prior to making comparative shoe–surface traction studies and the importance of using a studded outsole that is appropriate to the surface condition during play...|$|R

Myofibroblasts are contractile cells having features intermediate between those of the fibroblasts and smooth muscle. We conducted a study to explore whether such cells are present in preretinal membranes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 8 membranes, preelevated during vitrectomy for proliferative vitreoretinopathy or diabetic proliferative vitreoretinopathy, were analysed with immunostaining technique searching for alpha-actine smooth muscle, desmine, which are specific markers for myofibroblasts and TGF-beta 1, that is considered as the mean factor promoting the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts.

40|$|The {{traction}} {{provided by}} a footwear-surface interaction {{can have an impact}} on player safety, performance and overall enjoyment of sport. Mechanical test methods used for the testing and categorisation of safe playing surfaces do not tend to simulate loads occurring during participation on the surface, and thus are unlikely to predict human response to the surface. For example, the pendulum system routinely employed by the International Tennis Federation (I. T. F.) utilises a standard rubber ‘foot’, rather than a shoe sole, and does not apply forces comparable to those in real play. There is a requirement for an improved scientific understanding of the tribological interactions at the shoe surface interface and the effects footwear and surface parameters have on the <b>traction</b> <b>mechanism</b> developed. The relationship between normal force and the coefficient of traction for the forefoot of a tennis shoe in contact with different tennis surfaces was examined using a bespoke traction rig. The effects of surface roughness were also examined. A power relationship was found between normal force and traction. As normal force increased differences in surface traction were found. The normal force, stiffness, and roughness of the surfaces affected the adhesive and hysteresis friction mechanisms that contribute to the overall traction force...|$|E

In {{view of the}} {{fracturing}} {{occurred at}} the welded joint of the belt conveyor roller while being in use in a coal mine of Fujian Province, the paper analyses the roller’s structure and stress in {{the basis of the}} transmission principle. It explores the reasons of the fracturing problem, and then proposes method to improve the roller’s welding technology. These are the cause of the roller fracturing，which the tension of the belt is great, and the roller itself is not strong enough, and welding process of steel plate is poor, and welding quality is not high. Use CO 2 and Ar mixed gas shielded arc welding to do backing weld, then use the welding method of automatic submerged arc welding. Finally the tempering to the welded joint part with the track-type far-infrared heater eliminate the welding residual stress.

40|$|It is our strong {{believe that}} fashion - more {{specifically}} apparel - can support {{us so much}} more in our daily life than it currently does. The Cliff project takes the opportunity to create a generic automatized zipper. It {{is a response to}} the struggle by elderly, people with physical disability, and ladies who have problems zipping the back-zipper dress. An iterative “research through design” approach was applied (Toeters et al., 2012) to develop a working mechanism and identify the important factors to generate efficient <b>traction</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In between the iterations, the stakeholder and user feedback obtained from exhibitions has been used for the next iterations, which then led to the miniaturization of the Cliff prototype. The development progress of Cliff shows the tremendous potential of developing a generic automatized zipper, and it might be one of the approaches towards the “future of fashion” (Dunne, 2010). Problematic is that wearable systems are almost exclusively discussed with a functional focus. The functional benefit is entirely lost if a user refuses to adopt the technology because of social factors argues Dunne (2014). During the next steps, Visual Perception Aesthetics (Dunne, Profita and Zeagler, 2014), Dynamic Functionalities (Seymour, 2008), and Cliff’s Ease of Use (Starner et al., 1999) must be reconsidered depending on its context of use. It is crucial to ensure users could positively perceive and use the Cliff as an assistive device for the zipping and unzipping process.

40|$|This study proposes an {{efficient}} {{combination of the}} Discrete Element Method (DEM) and the Finite Element Method (FEM) to study the tractive performance of a rubber tire in interaction with granular terrain. The presented approach is relevant to all engineering devices interacting with granular matter which causes response forces. Herein, the extended discrete element method (XDEM) is {{used to describe the}} dynamics of the granular assembly. On the one hand, the discrete approach accounts for the motion and forces of each grain individually. On the other hand, the finite element method accurately predicts the deformations and stresses acting within the tire tread. Hence, the simulation domain occupied by the tire tread is efficiently described as a continuous entity. The coupling of both methods is based on the interface shared by the two spatially separated domains. Contact forces develop at the interface and propagate into each domain. The coupling method enables to capture both responses simultaneously and allows to sufficiently resolve the different length scales. Each grain in contact with the surface of the tire tread generates a contact force which it reacts on repulsively. The contact forces sum up over the tread surface and cause the tire tread to deform. The coupling method compensates quite naturally the shortages of both numerical methods. It further employs a fast contact detection algorithm to save valuable computation time. The proposed DEM-FEM Coupling technique was employed to study the tractive performance of a rubber tire with lug tread patterns in a soil bed. The contact forces at the tread surface are captured by 3 D simulations for a tire slip of 5 %. The simulations showed to accurately recapture the gross tractive effort, running resistance and drawbar pull of the tire tread in comparison to related measurements. Further, the <b>traction</b> <b>mechanisms</b> between the tire tread and the granular ground are studied by analysing the motion of the soil grains and the deformation of the tread...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the design {{characteristics}} of a pipe crawling vehicle which utilises a unique, innovative and patented drive system. The principle of the drive system is simple. That is, if a brush is inserted into a pipe and its bristles are swept back at an angle, then, {{it is easier to}} push the brush forwards through the pipe than it is to pull it backwards. Thus, if two brushes are interconnected by a reciprocating cylinder, then, by cycling the cylinder, it is possible for the vehicle to "crawl" through the pipe. The drive mechanism has two main advantages. The first is the ability of the bristles to deflect over or around obstacles, thus, the vehicles can be used in severely damaged pipes. Secondly, the drive mechanism is able to generate extremely high "grip" forces, thus, the vehicle has a high payload to weight ratio. This "simple" <b>traction</b> <b>mechanism</b> has subsequently been proven to be extremely capable in significantly hostile environments, for example, nuclear plants and sewers. The development of the vehicle has resulted in brushes being considered as "engineering" components. This thesis considers the forces present when a brush moves forward through a pipe, further, it also considers the forces present if the brush is required to grip the walls of the pipe. A "simple" cantilever model has been developed which predicts the force required to push a brush forwards through the pipe. A second model has been developed which predicts the forward to reverse or "slip" to "grip" ratio of a brush, for given functional conditions. This model is deemed satisfactory up to the onset of bristle buckling. The experimental program determined three factors, they were, the force required to load a brush into a pipe, the force required to push a brush forward through a pipe and the reverse force a brush could support prior to failure. It can be concluded that this vehicle, through its tractive capability arid environmental compliance, is able to traverse irregularly shaped pipes. Ultimately, this allows tooling to be transported and used at previously unobtainable positions within such pipes...|$|E

40|$|Third-party {{conflict}} management, particularly {{legal dispute}} resolution (arbitration and adjudica-tion) and mediation, can help improve {{the willingness of}} disputants to make asymmetric concessions by ameliorating commitment problems and providing political cover. In both regards, and espe-cially pertaining to commitment problems, mediation has substantial limitations when compared to legal dispute resolution. We develop these arguments and test the observable implications on the Issue Correlates of War data. To get <b>traction</b> on the <b>mechanisms</b> at work, we distinguish between challenger concessions and defender concessions, positing that challenger concessions face the pri-mary hurdle of political cover while defender concessions face the primary hurdle of commitment problems. We find that legal dispute resolution strongly increases the propensity for concessions by both challengers and targets, even major asymmetric concessions. Mediation, on the other hand, only helps increase minor challenger concessions. Also consistent with expectations, mediation best enables asymmetric challenger concessions in the highly salient cases that need the most political cover, and legal dispute resolution best enables asymmetric concessions when {{there has been a}} history of failed conflict management attempts that perpetuate mistrust. ...|$|R
40|$|Post tsunami {{survey of}} the October 25, 2010, Mentawai tsunami, {{has been carried out}} by a {{collaboration}} team of Indonesian-German scientists from 20 to 28 November 2010. One activity of the researches were investigation on tsunami deposits along the coast following the event that devastated the islands of Sipora, North Pagai and South Pagai. Sedimentological properties of Mentawai tsunami deposit were explained by this study, from both megascopic and laboratory result. In general, beaches along the study area are underlying by a stretch of reef limestone, sediments mostly composed of white sand while grey sand was found only at Malakopa. Tsunami sediments were taken from 20 locations, start from Betumonga at Sipora Island until Sibaru-baru Island at the southern tip of the study area. The thickness of tsunami deposits are ranged between 1. 5 and 22 cm, which are generally composed of fine to coarse sand in irregular boundaries with the underlying soil. Based on grain size analysis, variation of sedimentological properties of tsunami deposits range between phi=- 0, 5793 and phi= 3, 3180 or very coarse to very fine sand. Tsunami deposits mostly have multiple layers which described their transport processes, run up at the bottom and back wash at the top. Structural sediments such as graded bedding of fining upward, parallel lamination and soil clast were found. The grain size distribution curves show two types of mode peak, unimodal and multimodal which are indication of different sorting condition representing the source materials. While segment grain size accumulative plot generally shows domination of dilatation and <b>traction</b> transport <b>mechanism</b> rather than suspension. In general, very rare fossils were found from Mentawai tsunami deposit, but those findings gave information on how depth tsunami start to scour the seafloor and transport it landward, such as an abundance of Sponge spicule was found which indicate shallow water environments (20 - 100 m seafloor depth).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Increased spinal height due to {{the lack}} of of axial {{compression}} on spinal structures in microgravity may stretch the spinal cord, cauda equina, nerve roots, and paraspinal tissues. HYPOTHESIS: Exposure to simulated microgravity causes dysfunction of nerve roots so that the synaptic portion of the Achilles tendon reflex is delayed. METHODS: Six healthy male subjects were randomly divided into two groups with three in each group. The subjects in the first group underwent horizontal bed rest (HBR) for three days. After a two week interval they underwent bed rest in a position of head-down tilt with balanced traction (HDT). So that each subject could serve as his own control, the second group was treated identically but in opposite order. Bilateral F waves and H-reflexes were measured daily (18 : 30 - 20 : 30) on all subjects placed in a prone position. RESULTS: By means of ANOVA, differences between HDT and HBR were observed only in M-latency and F-ratio, not in F-latency, central latency, and H-latency. Differences during the course of the bed rest were observed in M-latency and H-latency only. Tibial H latency was significantly lengthened in HDT group on day 2 and 3, although no significant difference between HDT and HBR was observed. CONCLUSION: The monosynaptic reflex assessed by H-reflex was delayed during 6 degree HDT with <b>traction.</b> The exact <b>mechanism</b> of this delay and whether the change was due to lengthening of the lower part of the vertebrae remain to be clarified...|$|R
40|$|A high-traction fluid {{is one of}} {{the vital}} {{components}} of a <b>traction</b> drive; a <b>mechanism</b> where input power is transformed into an output force when pressure and shear force are applied to the fluid. In this environment they need to withstand high pressures, temperatures and shear forces, and must be able to lubricate at the same time. So far there has been very little research relating engineering performance to molecular structure. Previous work with model hydrocarbon traction fluids has shown that molecular rigidity about the centre of the molecule appears to be important. This work has now been extended to cyclohexyl esters. A series of cyclohexyl esters was synthesised, and where possible, x-ray structures were obtained. Extensive 13 C T 1 and NOE relaxation data over a range of radiofrequencies and temperatures were obtained and used to calculate correlation times, for both overall and internal motion, using both the "model-free" and reduced Lorentzian models. This provided information on the rigidity of the molecules studied, In addition molecules have been modelled using molecular dynamics techniques to calculate order parameters and torsion angle distributions. ESR studies have been conducted to measure the viscosity of each fluid. A spin probe, with a similar structure to one of the molecules studied, was synthesised. This allowed complimentary correlation time measurement, and showed that the molecule rotated isotropically. Difficulties were encountered in fitting the NMR data to the motional models and the need for higher radiofrequency data is indicated, to check the validity of the models used. The NMR, ESR and molecular dynamics results did, however, provide a consistent indication of the differing rigidities and motions of these molecules...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{variety of}} {{treatment}} options {{are available for}} the treatment of diabetic macular edema. They include laser photocoagulation, anti-VEGF drugs, intravitreal steroids, and vitrectomy with or without release of vitreoretinal traction. A full understanding of the physiological mechanisms of these treatment modalities allows sensible combination of treatment options. Retinal photocoagulation has repeatedly been shown to improve retinal oxygenation, as does vitrectomy. Oxygen naturally reduces VEGF production and thereby decreases leakage of plasma proteins from capillaries into the tissue. In addition, vitrectomy allows faster clearance of cytokines, such as VEGF, from the retina into the vitreous cavity. The VEGF-lowering effect of photocoagulation and vitrectomy can be augmented with anti-VEGF drugs and corticosteroids reduce the effect of VEGF on capillary permeability. Starling’s law explains vasogenic edema, which is controlled by osmotic and hydrostatic gradients between vessel and tissue. It explains how VEGF-induced vascular permeability causes plasma protein to leak into the tissue interstitial space, thus decreasing the osmotic pressure gradient between vessel and tissue, resulting in water accumulation, i. e. edema. This is reversed by reducing VEGF production, which is achieved with laser treatment; or by removing VEGF with antibodies or vitrectomy; or by reducing the permeability effect with steroids. At the same time, Starling’s law takes into account hemodynamic changes that affect the hydrostatic gradient. High arterial blood pressure and hypoxic vasodilatation increase the hydrostatic pressure in the microcirculation, which increases water flux from vessel to tissue and induce edema. Treatment of arterial hypertension or reversal of retinal hypoxia with laser reverses this pathophysiology and reduces edema. Newton’s third law explains, that vitreoretinal traction decreases hydrostatic tissue pressure in the retina, increases the pressure gradient between vessel and tissue, and stimulates water fluxes from vessel into tissue, leading to edema. Release of vitreoretinal <b>traction</b> reverses this <b>mechanism</b> and reduces edema...|$|R
