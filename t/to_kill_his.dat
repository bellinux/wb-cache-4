5|$|Arad's {{police force}} {{was chosen as}} the {{exceptional}} force for 2007, and awarded an award of excellence on 5 March 2008. Among others, a severe reduction in property crime was cited. Arad's force was able {{to reduce the amount of}} such crimes from 1,092 in 2003 to just 168 in 2007. On 18 July 2008, Arad police, in a rare incident, shot dead a man threatening <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>his</b> ex-wife with a knife.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{later said}} his {{biological}} {{father had a}} history of hitting his mother. James M. Cannon, a member of the Ford administration, wrote in a biography of Ford that the Kings' separation and divorce were sparked when, a few days after Ford's birth, Leslie King took a butcher knife and threatened <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>his</b> wife, his infant son, and Ford's nursemaid. Ford later told confidantes that his father had first hit his mother on their honeymoon for smiling at another man.|$|E

After taking possession of her father (Mitch Pileggi), he kills her mother and stabs himself <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>his</b> host. Mary's fiance, John Winchester, is the demon's next victim. Azazel makes his usual offer, giving her the chance to resurrect John, to produce a child he can use; now orphaned and alone, she reluctantly agrees without knowing his true intentions.|$|E
5|$|Demeke {{demanded that}} the {{aircraft}} be flown to New York City and demanded political asylum in the United States. After being told that the plane {{would need to be}} refueled, Demeke agreed to allow a refueling stop in Hannover, Germany. The aircraft landed at Hannover-Langenhagen Airport around noon local time, where it was surrounded by law enforcement officials. Demeke remained in the cockpit with the pistol to the pilot's head, and threatened to begin killing a flight attendant every five minutes. German authorities allowed the plane to depart after Demeke threatened <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>his</b> hostages but promised to surrender peacefully upon reaching the United States.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, U.S. {{federal judge}} Tena Campbell {{rejected}} Gardner's appeal that his attorneys were inadequate {{because they were}} unable to prove that he did not mean <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>his</b> victim. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected motions for appeal by his defense on March 8, 2010. Gardner attempted to give up the process at least three times, but his attorneys convinced him to continue appealing each time. State court Judge Robin Reese signed an execution warrant on April 23 ordering the state to carry out the death sentence.|$|E
5|$|Many of Bond's adversaries {{meet their}} deaths {{at the hands}} of Bond who often uses his {{environment}} or equipment <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>his</b> opponent. Mr. Big was killed when Bond force-fed him a pellet of compressed gas, causing him to inflate and explode whilst Hugo Drax was ejected into outer space. Very few villains actually survive the course of Bond's assignment, and their deaths often come in the final scenes of the film. Lindner has noted that a number of the villains or henchmen have met their deaths through Bond using the technology of the villains against themselves and these include Alec Trevelyan being speared by part of the communications dish, Elliot Carver impaled by his sea-drill and Renard skewered by a nuclear fuel rod.|$|E

5|$|Three {{different}} early {{versions of}} the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1, 1603); the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623). Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others. The play's structure and depth of characterisation have inspired much critical scrutiny. One such example is the centuries-old debate about Hamlet's hesitation <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>his</b> uncle, which some see as merely a plot device to prolong the action, but which others argue is a dramatisation of the complex philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold-blooded murder, calculated revenge, and thwarted desire. More recently, psychoanalytic critics have examined Hamlet's unconscious desires, while feminist critics have re-evaluated and attempted to rehabilitate the often maligned characters of Ophelia and Gertrude.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the series, Sasuke {{is shown}} as silent {{character}} who seeks to become stronger {{by any means}} in order <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>his</b> older brother, Itachi Uchiha, for betraying and murdering their entire clan. Nevertheless, Sasuke is moved when Naruto Uzumaki wants him {{to make peace with}} the village. As a result, Sasuke considers Naruto his only friend. By the end of the series, Sasuke becomes more kindhearted, but decides not to return to his home, choosing instead to redeem himself and search for an enemy threatening the peace in Konohagakure.|$|E
5|$|Until {{recently}} {{historians have}} accepted {{an account of}} the time that Tecumseh was furious with Tenskwatawa for losing the battle, and that Tecumseh had threatened <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>his</b> brother for making the attack. According to this story, the Prophet lost prestige after the battle and no longer served as a leader of the confederacy. In their subsequent meetings with Harrison, several Native leaders claimed that the Prophet's influence was destroyed; some accounts said that he was being persecuted by other leaders. Historians Alfred A. Cave and Robert Owens have argued that the Natives were probably trying to mislead Harrison, in an attempt to calm the situation, and that Tenskwatawa continued {{to play an important role}} in the confederacy.|$|E

The Aes Sedai work with Rand to interrogate Semirhage, another Forsaken captured {{at the end of}} Knife of Dreams. After being freed by her allies, Semirhage is given a Domination Band, an item used to control male channelers, and locks it around Rand's neck. She and Black Ajah sister Elza Penfell use it to make him torture and attempt <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>his</b> lover, Min Farshaw. Unable to channel, he reaches out and inexplicably accesses the True Power, a different power normally only granted by the Dark One, using it to free himself and kill Semirhage and Elza. After this, he resolves to make himself harder and emotionless. He banishes his adviser Cadsuane Melaidhrin for not securing the Domination Band, promising to kill her if he sees her face again.|$|E
5|$|At Eurocorp New York HQ, Denham and Merit believe Kilo is brain-dead {{and send}} him to be rebooted while they plan to {{retrieve}} Lily's chip and recover useful information on DART 6. Kilo begins to remember his secret past: he learns that Denham led a Eurocorp team <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>his</b> parents and abduct him as a baby because he has genes ideal for becoming an agent. Kilo escapes from his restraints and rescues Lily, who tells Kilo that like him, all of Eurocorp's agents were abducted as children and their memories were modified so they would remain loyal to Eurocorp. Lily created the DART 6 chip, hoping {{to use it to}} make the syndicates retain their humanity and care about both chipped and un-chipped civilians, but she realizes she was naïve to think that way.|$|E
5|$|Scientist Hector Hammond is {{summoned by}} his father, Senator Robert Hammond, {{to a secret}} {{government}} facility to perform an autopsy on Abin Sur's body {{under the watchful eye}} of Amanda Waller.

5|$|The Saint-Julien {{church is}} named after Julian the Hospitaller, patron of Cubzac. Julian is a legendary saint destined <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>his</b> parents, and {{informed}} about his destiny by a stag. He fled to escape his fate, but the prophecy realized nonetheless, and he became a hermit, helping people cross a river. One day, the Christ arrived to announce his pardon. From the Middle Ages to the French Revolution, the town would have been called Saint-Julien-de-Cubzac. The church is made of limestone and underwent important modifications in the 19th century, when in particular the steeple was rebuilt. The façade, however, still contains Roman remains. The church holds an 18th-century painting of the Baptism of Christ, classified Monument historique in 1913. The church {{is surrounded by a}} cemetery which was excavated in August 1978 by archaeologists under the direction of Richard Boudet.

John is able to temporarily gain control, and then begs Sam to use the Colt to kill Azazel. Unable to bring himself <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>his</b> father, Sam instead shoots him in the leg, causing Azazel to flee to safety. The Winchesters rush towards the hospital, but their car is rammed into by a semi-trailer truck being driven by a demonically-possessed truck driver.|$|E
5|$|Aries was {{not fully}} {{accepted}} as a constellation until classical times. In Hellenistic astrology, the constellation of Aries {{is associated with the}} golden ram of Greek mythology that rescued Phrixos and Helle on orders from Hermes, taking Phrixos to the land of Colchis. Phrixos and Helle were the son and daughter of King Athamas and his first wife Nephele. The king's second wife, Ino, was jealous and wished <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>his</b> children. To accomplish this, she induced a famine in Boeotia, then falsified a message from the Oracle of Delphi that said Phrixos must be sacrificed to end the famine. Athamas was about to sacrifice his son atop Mount Laphystium when Aries, sent by Nephele, arrived. Helle fell off of Aries's back in flight and drowned in the Dardanelles, also called the Hellespont in her honor. After arriving, Phrixos sacrificed the ram to Zeus and gave the Fleece to Aeëtes of Colchis, who rewarded him with an engagement to his daughter Chalciope. Aeëtes hung its skin in a sacred place where it became known as the Golden Fleece and was guarded by a dragon. In a later myth, this Golden Fleece was stolen by Jason and the Argonauts.|$|E
