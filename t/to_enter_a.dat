5|$|At this stage, Mr. W.E. Northey, {{representing}} the Toronto Arena Company {{asked to be}} admitted to the meeting and was admitted.

Though he performs the act and they fight, Lightning manages to renew his hope of seeing Serah again, reverse his transformation and lift his burden.|$|E

5|$|King Nechtan son of Der-Ile abdicated <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> monastery in 724 and {{was imprisoned}} by his {{successor}} Drest in 726.

5|$|Section 30, {{with regard}} to {{peremptory}} challenges, was re-enacted and supplemented in 1865. Section 30, {{with regard to}} a defendant's failure <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> plea, was extended from capital to all crimes by § 14 of the Crimes Act of 1825.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that for an icy satellite the size of Mimas or Enceladus <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>an</b> 'excited state' of tidal heating and convection, it would need <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>an</b> orbital resonance before it lost too much of its primordial internal heat. Because Mimas, being smaller, would cool more rapidly than Enceladus, its window of opportunity for initiating orbital resonance-driven convection would have been considerably shorter.|$|R

5|$|Another story relates how Dunstan nailed a {{horseshoe}} to the Devil's foot when he {{was asked}} to re-shoe the Devil's cloven hoof. This caused the Devil great pain, and Dunstan only agreed to remove the shoe and release the Devil after he promised never <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> place where a horseshoe is over the door. This is claimed as the origin of the lucky horseshoe.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves filter {{large amounts}} of water to feed and breathe {{but they are not}} {{permanently}} open. They regularly shut their valves <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> resting state, even when they are permanently submerged. In oysters, for example, their behaviour follows very strict circatidal and circadian rhythms according to the relative positions of the moon and sun. During neap tides, they exhibit much longer closing periods than during spring tides.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{can deal}} with even larger osmotic changes by accumulating osmoprotectants such as betaines or {{trehalose}} in their cytosol. Some of these molecules can allow cells to survive being completely dried out and allow an organism <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> state of suspended animation called cryptobiosis. In this state the cytosol and osmoprotectants become a glass-like solid that helps stabilize proteins and cell membranes from the damaging effects of desiccation.|$|E

5|$|Cordon area {{congestion}} pricing is a fee or tax paid by users <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> restricted area, usually within a city center, {{as part of}} a demand management strategy to relieve traffic congestion within that area. The economic rationale for this pricing scheme is based on the externalities or social costs of road transport, such as air pollution, noise, traffic accidents, environmental and urban deterioration, and the extra costs and delays imposed by traffic congestion upon other drivers when additional users enter a congested road.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when he ran}} for {{governor}} in 1826, Edwards had the good fortune <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> three-way race that split the Jacksonians between state Senator Thomas Sloo and Lieutenant Governor Adolphus Hubbard. As a campaign issue, Edwards focused on Illinois' dire financial situation, blaming Sloo and Hubbard and other legislators for it. Edwards won 49.5percent of the vote to Sloo's 46percent, with the rest going to Hubbard.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, a {{panel of}} experts, having {{completed}} a medical and mental evaluation of Manning, ruled that she was fit to stand trial. An Article 32 hearing, presided over by Lieutenant Colonel Paul Almanza, was convened on December 16, 2011, at Fort Meade, Maryland; the hearing resulted in Almanza's recommending that Manning be referred to a general court-martial. She was arraigned on February 23, 2012, and declined <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> plea.|$|E

5|$|Replenishment ships, {{known as}} oilers in the United States and fleet tankers in Commonwealth countries, are ships {{that can provide}} oil {{products}} to naval vessels while on the move. This process, called underway replenishment, extends {{the length of time}} a naval vessel can stay at sea, as well as her effective range. Prior to underway replenishment, naval vessels had <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> port or anchor to take on fuel. In addition to fuel, replenishment ships may also deliver water, ammunition, rations, stores and personnel.|$|E
5|$|Some {{majors and}} minors offer special {{academic}} programs. Completion {{of these programs}} does not result in any minor or other recognition. If a student wishes <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> professional school after graduation, {{he or she may}} undertake one of the pre-professional programs offered. Internships are required for some majors, where students can experience life outside of the classroom, however any student can enroll in an internship for elective credit. Saint Anselm participates in an archaeological excavation program allowing students to travel to Italy and unearth ancient Roman treasures. For prospective engineers, the college has agreements with other schools through the cooperative engineering program.|$|E

5|$|The Liberal Party's {{decision}} not <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> coalition with the Conservatives, and Baldwin's unwillingness to govern without a majority, led to Ramsay MacDonald's first minority Labour government which {{took office in}} January 1924. According to Lansbury's biographer, Bondfield turned down the offer of a cabinet post; instead, she became parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Labour, Tom Shaw. This appointment meant {{that she had to}} give up the TUC Council chair; her decision to do so, immediately after becoming the first woman to achieve this honour, generated some criticism from other trade unionists.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{determinant}} of infection for any virus {{is its ability}} <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> cell and produce additional infectious particles. The presence of CD155 is thought to define the animals and tissues that can be infected by poliovirus. CD155 is found (outside of laboratories) only on the cells of humans, higher primates, and Old World monkeys. Poliovirus is, however, strictly a human pathogen, and does not naturally infect any other species (although chimpanzees and Old World monkeys can be experimentally infected).|$|E
5|$|The {{wildcard}} (joker) {{system was}} introduced in 2004 to diversify the music featured.

The wildcard songs and artists were announced in January. Since the wildcards' introduction, three have won the competition. In 2011 there were 15 wildcards. The wildcard system was discontinued in 2013.|$|E
50|$|Turkey allows {{citizens}} of Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> using <b>a</b> {{national identity card}}.

Tunisia allows nationals of Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> using <b>a</b> national identity card if travelling on an organized tour. Anguilla, Dominica and Saint Lucia allow nationals of France <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> using <b>a</b> national ID card, while Dominica de facto also allows nationals of (at least) Germany and Sweden <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> with <b>a</b> national ID card (as of March 2016). Gambia allows nationals of Belgium <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> using <b>a</b> national ID card. Finally, Greenland allows Nordic citizens <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> with <b>a</b> national ID card (only Sweden and Finland have them, whereas Norway will introduce them in 2018). In practice, all EEA and Swiss citizens can use their ID cards, because no passport control takes place on arrival in Greenland, only by the airline at check-in and the gate, and both Air Greenland and Air Iceland accept any EEA or Swiss ID card.|$|R
