5|$|Many Final Fantasy {{games have}} been adapted as novels and manga series. With {{the advent of}} the Internet, web novels and digital {{publishing}} have also become common. <b>These</b> <b>stories</b> act as companion pieces, offering an interpretation of the game's events or expanding the plot of the games by depicting additional scenarios.|$|E
5|$|There {{are local}} stories of tunnels {{stretching}} from Dunstanburgh Castle to Craster Tower, Embleton and Proctor Steads, {{as well as}} a tunnel running from the castle well {{to the west of the}} castle. <b>These</b> <b>stories</b> may be linked to the presence of the drainage system around the castle.|$|E
5|$|Director Steven Spielberg {{licensed}} {{the title}} {{for use on}} an American television show called Amazing Stories that ran from 1985 to 1987. Between 1998 and 2000, Amazing Stories published a series of short stories based upon the Star Trek franchise. In 2002, <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> were reissued by Pocket Books in the collection Star Trek: The Amazing Stories.|$|E

40|$|Within {{the context}} of {{storytelling}} as oral tradition, this essay uses a grounded theory approach to explore a single research question about the socializing concepts found in examples of stories told to young children by their mothers and grandmothers in a rural Ugandan village. <b>These</b> <b>story</b> examples were gathered during {{the implementation of a}} socio-educational intervention project. This essay provides a descriptive analysis of the emergent themes and constructs in <b>these</b> <b>story</b> examples against the backdrop of a relevant theoretical framework and life in this rural Ugandan village...|$|R
50|$|Three short-story {{collections}} {{followed in}} quick succession, each published by Bilingual Press, an award-winning publisher affiliated with Arizona State University. <b>These</b> <b>story</b> collections established Olivas's {{reputation as a}} fiction writer.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the illness}} of Elisabeth Sladen, and her {{subsequent}} death on 19 April 2011, filming {{for the second}} half of the fifth series, which was due to air in the autumn of 2011, was postponed and later cancelled. Filming for three stories of the fifth series had been finished, and thus post-production on <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> was completed. The final series was aired from 3 to 18 October 2011 on CBBC and ended with a tribute to Elisabeth Sladen in the form of a video montage of scenes from the series and Doctor Who.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus also recounts that King Alexander I of Macedonia (an {{ancestor}} of Alexander the Great,) who was allied to the Persians and present in their camp, secretly rode to the Greek camp {{with a warning}} that the Persians had decided to attack, and that before the main battle Mardonius issued {{a challenge to the}} Spartans to fight a special battle between equal numbers of Spartans and Persians, which was declined. Some historians have called <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> improbable.|$|E
5|$|I {{had a lot}} of {{theories}} I was working with when I did the Poe films...One of my theories was that <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> were created out of the unconscious mind of Poe, and the unconscious mind never really sees reality, so until The Tomb of Ligeia. we never showed the real world. In Pit, John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I felt was more representative of the unconscious. That horseback interlude was thrown out because I didn't want to have a scene with people out in broad daylight.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the large}} volume of stories posted, a set of codes to {{describe}} the story content was developed. Writers were encouraged to include <b>these</b> <b>story</b> codes {{in the title of}} their stories.|$|R

5|$|In the {{earliest}} {{forms of the}} story, the woman's pig-like appearance {{was the result of}} witchcraft. Following her wedding day, the pig-faced woman's new husband was granted the choice of having her appear beautiful to him but pig-like to others, or pig-like to him and beautiful to others. When her husband told her that the choice was hers, the enchantment was broken and her pig-like appearance vanished. <b>These</b> <b>stories</b> became particularly popular in England, and later in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Iravan is {{also known}} in Indonesia (where his name is spelled Irawan). An {{independent}} set of traditions have developed around Irawan on the main island of Java where, for example, he loses his association with the Naga. Separate Javanese traditions present a dramatic marriage of Irawan to Titisari, daughter of Krishna, and a death resulting from a case of mistaken identity. <b>These</b> <b>stories</b> are told {{through the medium of}} traditional Javanese theatre (Wayang), especially in shadow-puppet plays known as Wayang Kulit.|$|E
5|$|Mary Celeste was not {{the first}} {{reported}} case of a ship being found strangely deserted on the high seas. Rupert Gould, a naval officer and investigator of maritime mysteries, lists several such occurrences between 1840 and 1855. Whatever the truth of <b>these</b> <b>stories,</b> it is the Mary Celeste that is remembered; the ship's name, or the misspelt Marie Celeste, has become fixed in people's minds as synonymous with inexplicable desertion.|$|E
50|$|The graphic {{representation}} of <b>these</b> <b>story</b> grammar elements {{is called a}} story map. The exact form and complexity of a map depends, of course, upon the unique structure of each narrative and the personal preference of the teacher constructing the map.|$|R

5|$|Poe had {{intended}} to collect {{a number of his}} early short stories into a volume titled Tales of the Folio Club in the 1830s. The collection would be unified as a series of tales presented by members of a literary club designed as burlesques of contemporary literary criticism. Poe had previously printed several of <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> in the Philadelphia Saturday Courier and the Baltimore Saturday Visiter.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the English Civil War also have left their mark. Local stories tell that Colonel Birch's niece, Alice Birch, {{fell in love with}} a {{handsome}} Royalist, Charles Clifford; according to <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> the two attempted to escape before the final assault but died in a flash flood while trying to cross the River Wye, and live on as ghosts on the site.|$|E
5|$|The popular Silver Brumby {{books by}} Elyne Mitchell were written for {{children}} and young adults. The stories describe the adventures of Thowra, a Brumby stallion. <b>These</b> <b>stories</b> were dramatised and made into a movie {{of the same name}} (also known as The Silver Stallion: King of the Wild Brumbies), starring Russell Crowe and Caroline Goodall. And also an animated children's television series.|$|E

50|$|The {{story is}} divided in many threads, based on primary, {{secondary}} and tertiary characters. These delve {{deeply into the}} rich and complex texture of the Universe providing {{a great sense of}} verisimilitude, also exploring some of Hamilton's darker themes. <b>These</b> <b>story</b> lines include Dariat's struggles inside Valisk, and the Deadnights' voyage to their 'Saviour'.|$|R
5|$|The {{source of}} many of <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> of Elagabalus's depravity is the Augustan History (Historia Augusta), which {{includes}} controversial claims. The Historia Augusta was most likely written {{toward the end of}} the 4th century during the reign of emperor Theodosius I. The life of Elagabalus as described in the Augustan History is of uncertain historical merit. Sections 13 to 17, relating to the fall of Elagabalus, are less controversial among historians.|$|E
5|$|The {{uncritical}} {{acceptance of}} Price's reports prompted a formal {{study by the}} Society for Psychical Research (SPR), which rejected most of the sightings as either imagined or fabricated and cast doubt on Price's credibility. His claims are now generally discredited by ghost historians. Neither the SPR's report nor the more recent biography of Price has quelled public interest in <b>these</b> <b>stories,</b> and new books and television documentaries continue to satisfy public fascination with the rectory.|$|E
5|$|The {{years from}} 1949 to 1953 are often {{considered}} {{the highlight of}} Vandersteen's career, when he combined large production with consistent high quality in his stories, the jokes, the many characters, and the graphical aspects, in which the charming quirkiness of the early years was balanced with the more rigorous ligne claire of Hergé. Many of <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> were loosely based on popular classics, ranging from Alexandre Dumas over Buffalo Bill to Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, with as culmination his comic in {{two parts of the}} legend of Till Eulenspiegel, made for Kuifje.|$|E

5|$|Though {{she never}} wed, rumours spread that Sophia became {{pregnant}} by Thomas Garth, an equerry of her father's, and {{gave birth to}} an illegitimate son {{in the summer of}} 1800. Other gossip declared the child was the product of rape by her elder brother the Duke of Cumberland, who was deeply unpopular. Historians are divided on the validity of <b>these</b> <b>stories,</b> as some believe she gave birth to Garth's child while others call them tales spread by the Royal Family's political enemies.|$|E
5|$|Various {{stories have}} been told about Bregowine's origins, {{including}} {{that he was a}} nobleman and a continental Saxon who converted to Christianity and came to Canterbury because of the saintly reputation of Theodore of Tarsus. Others say that he owed his elevation to King Æthelbert II of Kent, but all <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> rest on works that were written after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. There are no contemporary records of Bregowine before he was archbishop. It does not appear, however, that he was of Mercian origins like his predecessors Tatwin and Nothhelm.|$|E
5|$|While the game's cutscenes are {{animated}} with 3D graphics, {{the team}} recorded live-action videos {{to introduce the}} real-world skateboarding teams, so that players could better understand each team before selecting one to join. Neversoft interviewed professional skaters about their experiences of becoming known in the skateboarding world, then compiled elements of <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> into the game's script. Every skater who appears in the plot helped to craft their own scenes and voiced their own character.|$|E
