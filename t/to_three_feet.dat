5|$|Allison made {{landfall}} with a {{storm surge}} of two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>feet.</b> Combined with waves on top, areas of Galveston Island experienced {{a wall of}} water 8feet (2.5m) in height, creating overwash along the coastline. The storm caused winds of up to 43mph (69km/h) at the Galveston Pier. While Allison was stalling over Texas, it dropped heavy rainfall across the state, including 9.77inches (248mm) in Galveston, 12.13inches (308mm) in Jamaica Beach, Texas, and other similar totals along the coast. Minimal beach erosion was reported, and impact was minimal near the coast. While moving northward through Texas as a minimal tropical depression, Allison produced minor wind gusts. Shortly after making landfall, the storm spawned a tornado in Manvel of Brazoria County, causing damage to one home. Within hours of making landfall, rainfall totals of 8 to 12inches (200 to 300mm) were common in Galveston and Harris County. Flash flooding continued for days, with rainfall amounts across the state peaking at just over 40inches (1,033mm) in northwestern Jefferson County. In the Port of Houston, a total of 36.99inches (940mm) was reported.|$|E
5|$|The storm's effects {{north of}} Florida were minor. Rainfall {{reached up to}} nine inches (228mm) in extreme eastern South Carolina and four inches (101mm) in eastern North Carolina. Winds reached 50mph (60km/h) with gusts up to 66mph (101km/h) at the Oak Island Coast Guard Station near Cape Fear, North Carolina and 54mph (87km/h) with gusts of 77mph (123km/h) at the {{offshore}} tower at Frying Pan Shoals about forty miles southeast of Cape Fear on June 18 with 70mph winds (110km/h) the next day. A 68foot fishing trawler sunk {{off the coast of}} Cape Fear in North Carolina from the high waves; no one was killed as the sailors were rescued by the United States Coast Guard on June 19. Flooding was reported with tides of two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> in the Carolinas. Rainfall from the subtropical storm reached both states, reaching maximum peaks of up to five inches (127mm) on the Georgia coast and seven inches on the Georgia/South Carolina border. Rainfall totaled to about one inch (25mm) on the Virginian coast. A ship encountered winds of a minimum tropical storm with gusts as high as a maximum tropical storm. The ship also encountered a tidal surge of 15 to 20feet.|$|E

25|$|Above that, {{there were}} the rudens, which were made of ten inches of rammed concrete. The next layer, the nucleus, was made of twelve to {{eighteen}} inches of successively laid and rolled layers of concrete. Summa crusta of silex or lava polygonal slabs, one <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> in diameter and eight to twelve inches thick, were laid {{on top of the}} rudens. The final upper surface was made of concrete or well smoothed and fitted flint.|$|E
25|$|The night before, {{a terrific}} storm lashed {{the entire area}} badly. Prior to the battle, General Hill, seeing the rough terrain of the area as a hazard, had his men place a white cloth around their hats as a {{precaution}} {{to serve as a}} battle-badge. As it turned out, this was a great idea that may have aided immensely in the outcome...

25|$|They {{depicted}} the Indians as living at a bare subsistence level, typically located in small rancherias of extended family groups of 100 to 150 people. They had no apparent agriculture, no domesticated animals except dogs, no pottery, and their only tools were {{made out of}} wood, leather, woven baskets and netting, stones and horns. Shelters were made of branches and mud; some dwellings were built by digging into the ground two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> and then building a brush shelter on top covered with animal skins, tules and/or mud. Their clothing was minimal in the summer, with animal skins and coarse woven articles of grass clothing used in winter. Some tribes around Santa Barbara, California and the Channel Islands (California) were using large plank canoes to fish and trade, while tribes in the California delta and San Francisco Bay Area were using tule canoes and some tribes on the Northwest coast were using wooden dugout canoes.|$|E
25|$|The queen spent {{heavily on}} fashion, luxuries and gambling, though {{the country was}} facing a grave {{financial}} crisis and the population was suffering. Rose Bertin created dresses for her, and hair styles such as poufs, up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> (90cm) high, and the panache (a spray of feather plumes). She and her court also adopted the English fashion of dresses made of indienne (a material banned in France from 1686 until 1759), percale and muslin. By {{the time of the}} Flour War of 1775, a series of riots against the high price of flour and bread, her reputation among the general public was no better than that of the favorites of the previous kings. In fact, many in the country were beginning to blame her for the degrading economic situation, suggesting the country’s inability to pay off its debt was the result of her wasting the crown’s money. Through correspondence, Marie Antoinette's mother, Maria Theresa, expressed concern over her daughter's spending habits, citing the civil unrest it was beginning to cause.|$|E

25|$|Edmund Roberts {{calls the}} island Crokatoa in his journal. A paraphrased account follows: On 8 September 1832, US sloop-of war Peacock {{anchored}} off the north end, also visiting Long Island, {{in search of}} inhabitants, fresh water, and yams. It was found difficult to effect a landing anywhere, owing to a heavy surf and to the coral having extended itself to a considerable distance from the shore. Hot springs boiling furiously up, through many fathoms of water, {{were found on the}} eastern side of Krakatoa, 150 feet from the shore. Roberts, Captain Geisinger, and marine Lieutenant Fowler visited Forsaken island, having mistaken the singing of locusts for the sound of running water. The boat glided over crystal clear water, over an extensive and highly beautiful submarine garden. Corals of every shape and hue were there; some resembling sunflowers and mushrooms; others, cabbages from an inch <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> in diameter: while a third bore a striking likeness to the rose. The hillsides were typical of tropical climate; large flocks of parrots, monkeys in great variety, wild-mango and orange groves—a superb scene of plants and flowers of every description, glowing in vivid tints of purple, red, blue, brown, and green—but not the so-much-needed supply of water and provisions.|$|E
25|$|Drums {{are highly}} {{influential}} in American Indian music. Different tribes have different traditions about their drums {{and how to}} play them. For larger dance or powwow type drums, the basic construction is very similar in most tribes: a wooden frame or a carved and hollowed-out log, with rawhide buckskin or elk skin stretched out across the opening by sinew thongs. Traditionally American Indian drums are large, two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> in diameter, and they are played communally by groups of singers who sit around them in a circle. For smaller single-sided hand drums, a thinner frame or shell is used, and a rawhide surface is strung onto only one side, with lacing across the other. Other types include two basic styles of water drums: the Iroquois type and the Yaqui type. The Iroquois water drum is a small cup-shaped wooden vessel, with water inside it, and a moistened tanned hide stretched across the top opening; the wetness and tightness of the tanned hide produce changes in pitch as the water drum is played over time. The Yaqui type of water drum is actually a half gourd, large in size, that floats in a tub of water like a bubble on the surface; the outer round surface of the gourd is struck with a drum stick, and the vibrations are amplified using the tub of water as a resonator.|$|E

500|$|In June 2010, a leak on the {{starboard}} {{side of the ship}} caused Texas to sink two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> in her mooring. The leak was precipitated by a burned out pump, which allowed the ship to take on more water than usual. Consequently, a seam separation was pulled below the waterline creating a second leak. Once the leak was discovered, the broken pump was replaced. [...] of water had to be pumped from the ship. After the leak was above the waterline again, a rag was stuffed in it as a temporary fix. [...] On 9 June 2012 (almost two years to the day later), about 30 new leaks, between [...] holes and [...] gaps, were discovered, ultimately necessitating a three-week closure of the ship to visitors; removal of water and repair of these leaks was complicated by the presence of residual oil in Texass fuel bunkers.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} the park was created, Van Cortlandt Lake needed to be cleaned, as cesspools in Yonkers had leaked sewage into Tibbetts Brook, which fed into the lake. A 1903 annual report from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation {{mentioned}} that the lake had probably not been cleaned since the mid-18th century, and now contained a layer of [...] "refuse and vegetation on top, and an ooze two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> deep on the bottom," [...] with qualities more like a [...] "semi-bog." [...] Cleaning of the lake started in 1903. The lake's original earthen dam was removed, the lake was emptied, and [...] of deposits were dredged from the lake bed. A new [...] retaining wall was then erected along the lake's eastern shore, and a new dam was installed to reform the lake and to allow future cleaning of the lake without having to dredge it. After the opening of an overflow drain in 1911–1912, which connected to the sewer under Broadway completed in 1907, Tibbetts Brook was directed into the new sewer, The construction of the Van Cortlandt Golf Course compounded the lake's dirty condition, and by 1912, the lake and brook contained significant sedimentation.|$|E
500|$|Despite the evacuations, Nina's closest {{approach}} to Hawaii was 120miles away. However, it came {{close enough to}} bring winds and heavy rain to the islands. There were four deaths reported in connection to the storm. The first reported was on Oahu when Herman Palepana, a lineman in the Honolulu street department, was killed when he was electrocuted by a power line downed during Nina's passing. Soon after, a sampan called the Setsu Maru sent a distress call reporting that the boat was sinking 10miles east of Niihau. Even though the Navy sent the submarine rescue vessel Couchal and conducted an air-seas search for the vessel, {{no trace of the}} sampan or the wreckage had been found. All three people aboard the boat were reported dead as a result. Another person in Hanapepe was injured when a tree came through a window in his house, causing minor forehead cuts. The phone lines to the county seat of Kauai County, Lihue, were broken during the hurricane. The Aloha Theater in Hanapepe had been flooded by up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>feet</b> of water. Reports from the five major islands indicated that less than 50 homes had been damaged during the storm and roughly 12 of them being destroyed on Kauai alone. Another ship disaster occurred when the Greek freighter Margarita Chandris got caught in the storm's winds while heading to Honolulu from Kobe. A distress call from the ship described the ship as [...] "out of control". The initial fears were that the winds from Nina would pull the ship closer to its center. These fears were made worse when the ship was found to be cargoless, making it easier to be moved by the waves. A later call said that the crew was unable to steer the ship. Three ships, the Rainier, the United States Coast Guard cutter Winnebago and the cargoliner President Monroe, were sent out to find and guide the Chandris to port. The Monroe finally found the freighter and guided it toward land until the Winnebago caught up. The cutter finally caught up to the Margarita Chandris and relieved the President Monroe and started planning to board and make repairs. Afterward, it was decided that the Margarita Chandris had enough fuel to drift into Honolulu alone. Nina's proximity also caused heavy rains, with 20.42inches falling in Wainiha in 14hours. Overall, Hurricane Nina was responsible for $100,000 in damages (1957USD), mostly from heavy surf, some of which measured 35feet high.|$|E
