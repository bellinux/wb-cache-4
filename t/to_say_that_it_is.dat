25|$|Fielding for a fast bowler {{is usually}} aggressive, that is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{set up for}} the purpose of getting a wicket rather than {{preventing}} the flow of runs. On occasion, particularly when the fielding team is batting last and is chasing a total, a defensive field is required. As a general rule it is difficult to bowl defensive fast bowling – that task is better suited to spin bowlers.|$|E
25|$|In response, many {{communities}} began passing ordinances that either restricted or prohibited their sale outright. The head shops and other sellers of paraphernalia challenged them in court.

25|$|Homosexual {{behavior}} is a ground for divorce, {{an act of}} sexual misconduct punishable as a crime in Alabama, a crime against nature, an inherent evil, and an act so heinous that it defies one's ability to describe it. That is enough under the law to allow a court to consider such activity harmful to a child. To declare that homosexuality is harmful {{is not to make}} new law but to reaffirm the old; <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not harmful is to experiment with people's lives, particularly the lives of children.|$|E
25|$|Under this scheme, {{the foreign}} partner {{that makes the}} initial {{investment}} can repatriate the return on the investment (at a pre-agreed fixed rate) through goods and services produced by the project. While many foreign companies believe that this method is a mere financing instrument for Iran, it is more accurate <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a compromise formula for foreign investment in the short-run. In the medium to long-term, more appropriate laws and regulations will probably replace the buy-back scheme. In other words, once the constitutional concerns have been dealt with, the foreign partners of buy-back agreements can take over the projects that they are involved in, or they can enter into {{a joint venture with}} an Iranian partner.|$|E

500|$|While {{some critics}} thought Mariah was {{trying too hard}} with [...] "Thirsty," [...] the song has {{garnered}} mostly positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Christina Lee for Idolator was complimentary of the song, describing it as a single which her record label most probably wanted to release from the album in the first place. She went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> [...] "tailor-made" [...] for radio airplay [...] "right now." [...] Writing for the same publication, Mike Wass wrote that he thought the solo version {{was better than the}} alternate version featuring Rich Homie Quan's rap verse, writing [...] "It's an improvement on the original.

500|$|There {{were also}} many who criticized the film. [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it 2.5 stars out of 4; {{he felt that}} a more {{traditional}} take on the story would have been [...] "more exciting" [...] and [...] "less gimmicky". Andy Klein of Daily Variety Gotham complained about the script, describing it as [...] "listless" [...] and remarked, [...] "If only its script were as amusing as its visuals." [...] A. O.

[...] How the decision was made that 'Hold It Against Me' would be a better first single over this is baffling." [...] Parker Bruce of the Washington Square News stated that the song functions as [...] "a sort of formal declaration and mission statement" [...] for Femme Fatale, saying that [...] "It is not an innovative song, but it is fantastically effective and endlessly enticing with its liberating, toss-your-cares-away, dance-like-a-complete–and-utter-fool cathartic chorus, repeated words and typically saucy Britney lyrics." [...] The Daily Collegian writer Hannah Rishel said [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] would have been [...] "another good lead single", while The Washington Timess Andrew Leahey said that along with [...] "Till the World Ends", they are [...] "bass-heavy tributes to club culture." ...|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{were also}} positive; Sal Cinquemani form Slant Magazine {{suggested}} that [...] "The Fear" [...] is {{proof of the}} pop singer's self-awareness, but, given her own personal tabloid history, the song possesses a trail of irony: [...] "I'll look at The Sun and I'll look in The Mirror/I'm on the right track, yeah, we're onto a winner." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly liked the song, in which Allen makes fun of her own material-girl ID and went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in fact [...] "a tale of two Lilys: the naughty postadolescent in the rearview mirror, and the fully realized female coming around the bend." [...] Chris Buckle from The Skinny gave [...] "The Fear" [...] three stars, commenting that it [...] "is a potent reminder that she's more than just gobby gossip-fodder", but also disliked a few lyrics, which [...] "in particular [...] a clumsy attempt to inject politics amongst the celeb-woe naval-gazing", while About.com praised the song for being a [...] "pop masterpiece", Allen's [...] "witty intelligent lyrics" [...] and compared it to Pink's [...] "Stupid Girls".|$|E
500|$|A Wizard of Earthsea {{has strong}} {{elements}} of an epic; for instance, Ged's place in Earthsea history is described {{at the very}} beginning of the book in the following terms: [...] "some say the greatest, and surely the greatest voyager, was the man called Sparrowhawk, who in his day became both dragonlord and Archmage." [...] The story also begins with words from the Earthsea song [...] "The Creation of Éa", which forms a ritualistic beginning to the book. The teller of the story then goes on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> from Ged's youth, thereby establishing context for the rest of the book. In comparison with the protagonists of many of Le Guin's other works, Ged is superficially a typical hero, a mage who sets out on a quest. Reviewers have compared A Wizard of Earthsea to epics such as Beowulf. Scholar Virginia White argued that the story followed a structure common to epics in which the protagonist begins an adventure, faces trials along the way, and eventually returns in triumph. White went on to suggest that this structure can be seen in the series as a whole, as well as in the individual volumes.|$|E
500|$|Amy Sciarretto for Popcrush was {{complimentary}} of Lewis's vocals, {{writing that}} she sounds [...] "appealing and captivating," [...] and continued <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> what her fans {{have been waiting}} for. Sciarretto gave [...] "Collide" [...] a rating of three {{out of a possible}} five stars. Lewis Corner for Digital Spy praised the song, writing that Lewis combined her ability to deliver power ballad lyrics into a dance orientated song. Corner compared the song to Katy Perry's [...] "Firework", also produced by Sandy Vee; however, Corner noted that Lewis performs [...] "Collide" [...] in a way which distances the comparison. Katherine St. Asaph for Popdust was critical of the song. Whilst she noted that Lewis was venturing into dance music, where artists such as David Guetta and Kylie Minogue have experienced great success, and that Lewis has an iconic voice compared to both, she felt that the delivery still lacked. St. Asaph wrote [...] "The lethargic, two-note verses make her voice sound less husky than bored, an emotion that a comeback single should never evoke." [...] Michael Cragg for The Guardian felt that the song seemed to build and drop at the wrong times, and that its structure was not cohesive. Cragg continued to say that Lewis does a [...] "passable job as a dance diva," [...] and noted the resemblances between [...] "Collide" [...] and [...] "Penguin".|$|E
