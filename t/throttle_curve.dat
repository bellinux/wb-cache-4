50|$|Two of the bike's four {{throttle}} {{bodies are}} controlled mechanically, {{while the other}} two are controlled electronically by the ECU, hypothetically smoothing power delivery. The ECU-controlled throttle bodies can be adjusted by computer for refinement of the <b>throttle</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E
50|$|The CBR600F3 is {{the third}} {{generation}} of the CBR600F series. It replaced the F2, and was produced from 1995 to 1998. It had a modified engine, ram-air intake and cartridge forks. The 1997 and 1998 models also came with a deeper oil pan, sleeker tail fairings, seat and tail light, and a revised engine head netting about a 5 hp gain over 95/96 models. The CDI and ram-air system were also revised to allowed for smoother <b>throttle</b> <b>curve</b> over the 95/96 models, which could sometimes be jerky. The last made 1998 models came with another revised engine head {{which resulted in a}} slight power gain. In 1999, it was replaced by the CBR600 F4.|$|E
40|$|The RC 2 - 75, {{a liquid}} cooled two chamber rotary {{combustion}} engine (Wankel type), designed for aircraft use, was tested and representative baseline (212 KW, 285 BHP) performance and emissions characteristics established. The testing included running fuel/air mixture control curves and varied ignition timing to permit selection of desirable and practical settings for running wide open <b>throttle</b> <b>curves,</b> propeller load curves, variable manifold pressure curves covering cruise conditions, and EPA cycle operating points. Performance and emissions data were recorded {{for all of}} the points run. In addition to the test data, information required to characterize the engine and evaluate its performance in aircraft use is provided over a range from one half to twice its present power. The exhaust emissions results are compared to the 1980 EPA requirements. Standard day take-off brake specific fuel consumption is 356 g/KW-HR (. 585 lb/BHP-HR) for the configuration tested...|$|R
40|$|We derive analytically, the {{performance}} optimal <b>throttling</b> <b>curve</b> for a processor under thermal constraints {{for a given}} task sequence. We found that keeping the chip temperature constant requires an exponential speed curve. Earlier works that propose constant throttling only keep the package/case temperature constant, and are hence suboptimal. We develop high-level thermal and power models that are simple enough for analysis, yet account for important effects like the power-density variation across a chip (hotspots), leakage dependence on temperature (LDT), and differing thermal characteristics of the silicon die and the thermal solution. We use a piecewiselinear approximation for the exponential leakage dependence on temperature, and devise a method to remove the circular dependency between leakage power and temperature. To solve the multitask speed control problem, we first solve analytically, the single task problem with a constraint on the final package temperature using optimal control theory. We then find the optimum final package temperature of each task by dynamic programming. We compared the total execution time of several randomly generated task sequences using the optimal control policy against a constant speed throttling policy, and found significantly smaller total execution times. We compared the thermal profiles predicted by the proposed high-level thermal model {{to that of the}} Hotspot thermal model, and found them to be in good agreement...|$|R
40|$|The {{authors would}} like to express their {{gratitude}} to Dagny Wienes, Saskia Wohlgemuth and Arnoud Cuppens for their work on early versions of the software, the numerous simulations and tests and fruitful discussions that led to the final version of Cosimat and the buildup and calibration methodology. Building conceptual sewer models can be a time-consuming task, especially for large or complex models or models that require input data that might be difficult/tedious to obtain manually. This paper presents a semi-automated procedure for the buildup and calibration of one conceptual model that requires detailed input data such as <b>throttle</b> dimensions, pump <b>curves</b> or water level-storage relations. The procedure uses a hydrodynamic model as basis for sewer network data to create the model layout. A standardised series of composite rainfall events is applied to the hydrodynamic model in order to obtain the necessary reference data for the automated calibration of the conceptual model. Both model buildup and calibration are illustrated by means of a case study. Comparison of results of the hydrodynamic and conceptual model for a 1 year long-term series shows that the automated buildup and calibration can lead to an accurate conceptual model in short time. status: publishe...|$|R
