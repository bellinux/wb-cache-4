5|$|Kuntz {{was born}} on February 4, 1955 in Orange, California. He was born to Chet and Willie Kuntz. His father was a {{bricklayer}} who later became an auto mechanic. The family moved from Orange to Wichita, Kansas when Rusty was young, then moved to Paso Robles, California a few years later. He attended Paso Robles High School in California, where he played baseball, basketball, and football. He said <b>that</b> <b>baseball</b> was his least favorite of the three sports {{at the time and}} that he was drawn to basketball because of the game's pace.|$|E
5|$|The Mets {{performance}} in the playoffs drew heavy television viewership, with the decisive game of the NLCS scoring the highest ratings for any League Championship Series broadcast since 1993. Overall the NLCS averaged 10.9 million viewers, 18% higher than the NLCS had drawn the year before. Variety writer Tom Bierbaum argued {{this was a good}} sign for the future of baseball because the Mets and Boston Red Sox had drawn younger viewers during their time in the postseason. Bierbaum believed <b>that</b> <b>baseball</b> needed fresh teams, not just the often-successful Yankees and Braves, to draw new audiences and grow viewership.|$|E
5|$|The defections to the Mexican {{league and}} the threat of a strike by the Pirates {{prompted}} owners to form an advisory committee, chaired by Larry MacPhail, to suggest needed changes that would calm the discontent among the players. On August 27, 1946, the committee presented a draft a document outlining the changes. Language in the original draft admitted <b>that</b> <b>baseball</b> was operating as a monopoly and that racial bias was the sole reason for segregation in baseball. Baseball's attorneys stripped this controversial language from the version eventually adopted by the owners.|$|E

50|$|The number 26 (as in 26th man) was retired by the Angels in Autry's honor. The chosen number {{reflected}} <b>that</b> <b>baseball's</b> rosters are 25-man strong, so Autry's unflagging {{support for}} his team made him the 26th member.|$|R
5000|$|It {{cannot be}} denied <b>that</b> early <b>baseball</b> law was lax {{compared}} {{to the standards of}} today. As with so many other examples, the development of baseball law mirrors the arc of America’s history at large. Despite the many cases and legal examples, historians Robert M. Jarvis and Phyllis Coleman have suggested <b>that</b> “early <b>baseball</b> was a lawless place, just like America itself.” ...|$|R
5|$|The first {{recorded}} baseball event in Australia {{took place in}} Melbourne, Victoria in 1857, between teams from Collingwood and Richmond. Accounts vary as to the details, including {{whether it was a}} single game or a series of threegames, though details in common include a score of 350–230 in favour of Collingwood, and that the rules used were some form of hybrid between cricket and baseball, with teams batting until all players were out, and runs being scored for every base crossed, rather than just for reaching home plate. Though there are no records to confirm it, the commonly held belief is <b>that</b> <b>baseball</b> in Australia originated on the Ballarat gold-fields among American miners. The Claxton Shield, the first annually recurring national tournament, commenced in 1934. Though the tournament itself has been supplanted at various points in its history, the physical Shield is still awarded to the national champions in the Australian Baseball League. From 2011, the national champions will meet other champions from Japan, South Korea and Chinese Taipei in the Asia Series.|$|E
25|$|When the Newark {{franchise}} was dissolved {{prior to}} the 1950 season, he was demoted by the Yankees' organization to the Binghamton Triplets, an A-class team within its minor league system. He refused to report and instead filed suit, arguing the reserve clause was a restraint of trade and <b>that</b> <b>baseball</b> should not be exempt from antitrust laws.|$|E
25|$|In that case's {{majority}} opinion, Harry Blackmun {{conceded that}} the facts no longer supported the exemption and <b>that</b> <b>baseball</b> was indeed interstate commerce, but echoed Clark in suggesting that the consequences of overturning the previous decisions would be worse than letting it stand. Chief Justice Warren Burger agreed in a short concurrence that also indicated his acceptance of Douglas's regret.|$|E

25|$|After the Tampa Bay Rowdies {{moved to}} Al Lang Stadium in 2011, the playing surface and seating {{arrangement}} {{had to be}} constantly alternated between baseball and soccer configurations, especially in the spring. The resulting poor condition of the turf led to complaints by Rowdies management and, in October 2014, an agreement <b>that</b> <b>baseball</b> would not be played at the facility.|$|E
25|$|Baseball {{had been}} played in Mayagüez since the Spanish–American War; a city {{yearbook}} from the 1970s {{claimed that the}} very same day troops of the United States Army invaded the city (August 11, 1898), the troops played an impromptu baseball game on the city's main plaza. However, evidence tends to confirm <b>that</b> <b>baseball</b> became a regular pastime in the city by 1902.|$|E
25|$|Jerry Grossman {{has written}} {{that it could be}} argued <b>that</b> <b>Baseball</b> Hall of Famer Hank Aaron can be {{considered}} to have an Erdős number of 1 because they both autographed the same baseball (for Carl Pomerance) when Emory University awarded them honorary degrees on the same day. Erdős numbers have also been proposed for an infant, a horse, and several actors.|$|E

25|$|By a 5–3 margin, the Court {{upheld the}} Federal Baseball and Toolson precedents. One justice, William O. Douglas, {{who had been}} part of the {{majority}} in the latter case, dissented this time and expressed his regret. Even Harry Blackmun's majority opinion conceded <b>that</b> <b>baseball</b> was as much interstate commerce as the other professional sports to which the Court had refused to extend the antitrust exemption.|$|E
25|$|On October 13, 1971, the World Series held a {{night game}} {{for the very first}} time. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who felt <b>that</b> <b>baseball</b> could attract a larger {{audience}} by featuring a prime time telecast (as opposed to a mid-afternoon broadcast, occurring when most fans either worked or attended school), pitched the idea to NBC. An estimated 61 million people watched Game 4 on NBC; television ratings for a World Series game during the daytime hours would not have approached such a record number.|$|E
25|$|Former {{lieutenant}} governor of Colorado, David C. Coates was a labor militant, and {{was present at}} the founding convention, although it is unknown if he became a member.

Murrow of having been an IWW member, which Murrow denied. Some of the organization's most famous current members include Noam Chomsky, Tom Morello, mixed martial arts fighter Jeff Monson and anthropologist David Graeber.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} is often remembered today as {{paving the way}} for free agency in baseball. However, it did so, according to Bill James, only by showing players they could not rely on the courts to strike down the antitrust exemption and the reserve clause along with it. But the effort by a player of Flood's stature did galvanize the players, and according to Marvin Miller it made the general public aware of the reserve clause. Labor law proved a more fruitful opportunity for the invalidation of the reserve clause. The next year the National Labor Relations Board voted <b>that</b> <b>baseball</b> came under its jurisdiction, and that led to the Seitz decision three years later that Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally were free agents after they had played out a year without signing new contracts. That event is considered the true beginning of baseball free agency.|$|E
500|$|Wilhelm's ERA {{increased}} to 3.93 over 59 games and 103 innings pitched in 1955, {{but he managed}} a 4–1 record. He finished the 1956 season with a 4–9 record and a 3.83 ERA in [...] innings. Sportswriter Bob Driscoll later attributed Wilhelm's difficulties in the mid-1950s to {{the decline in the}} career of Giants catcher Wes Westrum, writing <b>that</b> <b>baseball</b> was [...] "a game of inches, and for Hoyt, Wes had been that inch in the right direction." ...|$|E
500|$|Ponsford {{simultaneously}} {{retired from}} baseball and cricket in 1934. In his newspaper column, {{he said that}} he liked both sports equally. He felt <b>that</b> <b>baseball</b> gave a player more opportunities to perform: [...] "In cricket you may have the bad luck to get out early; which often means a blank afternoon. It is not so with baseball; you are in the game all the time." [...] Joe Clark, the author of History of Australian Baseball, said [...] "Ponsford is {{considered by many to be}} the best baseballer of his time in Australia." [...] The official program for the 1952 Claxton Shield—held in Perth—made a similar claim.|$|E

500|$|After the Yankees won Game 2 at the Polo Grounds, the Series {{returned}} to Yankee Stadium for Game 3. Stengel won it, 1–0, {{on a home}} run into the right field bleachers. As the Yankee fans booed Stengel, he thumbed his nose at the crowd and blew a kiss toward the Yankee players, outraging the team's principal owner, Jacob Ruppert, who demanded <b>that</b> <b>Baseball</b> Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis fine or suspend Stengel. Judge Landis declined, [...] "a man who wins two games with home runs may feel a little playful, especially if he's a Stengel".

500|$|The Sherman Antitrust Act {{was enacted}} in 1890 {{to oppose the}} use of combinations, {{monopolies}} or cartels that harmed free and open trade. [...] It prohibited the restraint of trade.

[...] The Clayton Act allows for private parties to bring suit for treble damages and for injunctive relief. [...] From 1922 (when Federal Baseball Club v. National League ruled <b>that</b> <b>baseball</b> was not considered interstate commerce) until the late 1950s, sporting events {{were considered to be}} exempt from both acts, until the Supreme Court decision in International Boxing Club v.

500|$|On June 3, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs {{said during}} his morning press briefing, [...] "I hope <b>that</b> <b>baseball</b> awards a perfect game to that pitcher", joking that the White House was [...] "going {{to work on}} an {{executive}} order" [...] to that effect. He elaborated, [...] "To watch an umpire take responsibility and to watch a pitcher do what he did, the type of sportsmanship that was exhibited there—I think that gives a lot of heart (...) I think it's tremendously heartening to see somebody understand that {{they made a mistake}} and somebody accept the apology from somebody who made that mistake. I think that's a good lesson in baseball." [...] Michigan state Governor Jennifer Granholm also issued a gubernatorial proclamation stating, in part, [...] "I, Jennifer M.
