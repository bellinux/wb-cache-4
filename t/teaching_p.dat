40|$|PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To examine {{differences}} in nursing care received by patients {{with breast cancer}} enrolled in clinical trials and those not enrolled in clinical trials. DESIGN: Retrospective review of clinic charts. SETTING: Oncology outpatient department of a tertiary-care hospital. SAMPLE: 90 women with early stage breast cancer. The {{mean age of the}} women was 53 years. More than half of the women (51 of 90) were treated in a clinical trial. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all the nurse-patient clinic encounters for a six-month period from date of cancer diagnosis. The content of each encounter was coded using {{a modified version of the}} Nursing Action Classification System. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Nursing interventions (i. e., assessment, medical scheduling, psychosocial scheduling, reassurance, and teaching) and phone calls. FINDINGS: Women enrolled in clinical trials had more phone interactions with nursing staff (p = 0. 003) and received <b>teaching</b> (<b>p</b> 3 ̆c 0. 001) and reassurance (p = 0. 005) from nursing staff more often than women not enrolled in clinical trials. Controlling for age and stage of disease, <b>teaching</b> (<b>p</b> 3 ̆c 0. 001), and reassurance (p = 0. 10) were the primary {{differences in}} nursing care between the patients enrolled in clinical trials and those not enrolled. CONCLUSION: Differences in nursing care received exist between patients with breast cancer enrolled in clinical trials and those not enrolled. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Both teaching and reassurance are important components of caring for patients with cancer and are associated with treatment compliance. If the results of this study are confirmed, measures must be employed to ensure that all patients receive optimal care...|$|E

40|$|Although {{studies of}} teacher {{preparation}} programs have documented positive changes in mathematical knowledge for teaching with preservice teachers in mathematics content courses, this study focused {{on the impact of}} a mathematics methods course and follow-up student teaching assignment. The presumption was that preservice teachers would show growth in their mathematical knowledge during methods since the course was structured around active participation in mathematics, research-based pedagogy, and was concurrent with a two-day-per-week field experience in a local elementary school. Survey instruments utilized the computer adaptive test version of the Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching (MKT) measures from the Learning Mathematics for Teaching Project, and the Attitudes and Beliefs (towards mathematics) survey from the Mathematical Education of Elementary Teachers Project. A piecewise growth model analysis was conducted on data collected from 176 participants at 5 time-points (methods, 3 time-points; student teaching, 2 time-points) over a 9 month period. Although the participants' demographics were typical of U. S. undergraduate preservice teachers, findings suggest that initial low-level of mathematical knowledge, and a deep-rooted belief {{that there is only one}} way to solve mathematics problems, limited the impact of the methods and student teaching courses. The results from this study indicate that in (a) number sense, there was no significant change during methods (p =. 392), but a significant decrease during student <b>teaching</b> (<b>p</b> <. 001), and in (b) algebraic thinking, there was a significant decrease during methods (p <. 001), but no significant change during student <b>teaching</b> (<b>p</b> =. 653).

40|$|We tried {{determining}} {{the opinion of}} nine-year primary school class teachers in fourth and fifth grades {{on the topic of}} implementing small ball in P.

The first few questions were general (gender, age, year of education). What followed were questions about teaching small ball (popularity of <b>teaching</b> <b>P.</b> E. and small ball, success in teaching small ball, the amount of time dedicated to small ball, teaching methods and forms, exercise equipment and teaching conditions, extracurricular small ball activities, small ball competitions, etc.). The goal of the research was to determine to what extent teachers like <b>teaching</b> <b>P.</b> E. and small ball and how many lessons they devote to small ball on a yearly basis. We wanted to find out whether teachers would prefer to let other class teachers or P. E. teachers teach such activities or if they would prefer teaching them themselves. We tried {{determining the}} general opinion on small ball, on how pupils liked it and what conditions the schools provide for teaching small ball. We also tried to find out how often teachers opt for the use of balls in gymnastics, what kind of teams they assemble, whether they simplify or alter the rules and how much attention they devote to individual aspects of small ball. We were also interested in determining how often teachers use the appropriate vocabulary, how often they point it out to pupils, whether the school takes part in extracurricular activities and if it offers interclass and inter-school small ball competitions for fourth and fifth graders. What we also researched was whether teachers think that school surroundings offer appropriate conditions for teaching small ball and if they could contribute to an increased interest in teaching small ball. Lastly, we wished to figure out how well teachers were trained for teaching small ball and if they were interested in further training in the sphere. The research involved 135 (a hundred and thirty-five) fourth- and fifth-grade teachers in nine-year primary schools. Methods of basic statistics were used to process the acquired data.

In this study we measured the impact of educational and behavioral interventions on resident knowledge about and attitudes toward health care disparities. Methods: Faculty from 6 residency programs designed and presented an hour-long educational intervention to {{emphasize the importance of}} and increase resident knowledge about health care disparities. Selected residents then helped design a month-long behavioral intervention to engage their peers in conversations about disparities with patients. Surveys were administered pre- and post-educational intervention as well as post-behavioral intervention in order to measure the impact each intervention had on resident knowledge and attitudes. Results: Paired-samples t-tests showed that residents were more knowledgeable about health care disparities issues following didactic <b>teaching</b> (<b>P</b> < 0. 001) and felt such issues were more important (P < 0. 001). Furthermore, presence of these feelings significantly predicted the frequency of engaging in the behavioral intervention (r = 0. 44, P < 0. 01). Conclusions: Two brief, simple interventions produced significant changes in resident knowledge, attitudes and behaviors regarding health care disparities.

40|$|This {{research}} targeted {{elementary education}} graduates {{of a large}} Southwestern university who were transfer students, and compared them to native students on selected variables. These variables included retention in teaching, and perception of supports and obstacles at the university. The sample consisted of 143 respondents: 73 native and 70 transfer students. Data were collected through submission of online surveys and through postal mail. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were used to answer the research questions. Astin’s input-environment-outcome model provided the conceptual and theoretical framework for this study. Native and transfer students considered student teaching to be the “most helpful” course or service during their time at the university, yet both felt they lacked elements of preparation for teaching in the real world.

40|$|Body {{painting}} {{as a tool}} for teaching anatomy is becoming increasingly popular as it is fun and diffuses the formal academic context. Students claim bright color plays a significant role in retention of knowledge from painting sessions. Medical students (n = 117) were divided into two conditions: block color (CLR) and black outlines (BLK). Students completed a pre-test before a body painting teaching session on abdominal referred pain. CLR students used bright block colors, and BLK students mapped outlines in black. Immediately afterward, students sat a mid-test to compare the conditions. Students completed a post-test to compare long-term retention of knowledge four weeks later. There was no difference in knowledge between the two conditions immediately after the <b>teaching</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 653). There {{was no significant difference in}} long-term retention of knowledge between those using black outlines and those using color (P = 0. 278).

This work provides no easy answers for the uses of picture books but instead is a comprehensive examination of how picture books contribute to our understanding of pedagogy and philosophy. If one reflects on the title, one may notice that it does not include a reference to Philosophy for Children. This appears to be intentional. My sense is that the authors consider themselves educators of philosophy who use picture books as a way to teach philosophy. While the authors advocate for the teaching methodology that is grounded in the work of Matthew Lipman and others involved in Philosophy for Children (P 4 C), the authors do not wish to only address this narrower audience. They are educators and philosophers who use P 4 C as a part of their teaching approaches. “Picturebooks and philosophy for children (P 4 C) provide a framework to support adults’ exploration with courage and confidence” (Haynes & Murris, 2012, p. 1).
