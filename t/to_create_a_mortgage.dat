50|$|When {{the housing}} market crashed in 2008, tax-exempt bonds {{switched}} places with taxable bonds and sold at a higher price. This {{made it impossible for}} the corporation to issue more bonds to finance mortgage loans. UHC then switched to a different business model by copying the mortgage bankers. Instead of issuing bonds and using the cash <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> loan, UHC now borrows the cash (from their own cash reserves) to create mortgage loans, then bundles multiple mortgage loans together and sells them as mortgage-backed securities in order to get their money back and then lend it out again which creates a recurring source of revenue. UHC also offers a down payment assistance loans to help buyers without a down payment. In 2012, Governor Herbert helped announce two new loans to help fulfill Utah Housing’s mission, one of which is a loan that offers no mortgage insurance to help keep payments lower for borrowers.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the underlying fairness of applying equitable security presumptions to the deposit of title documents belonging to third parties. It argues that within such transactions, {{the focus of the}} equitable jurisdiction must be upon the intention of the owner of the title documents rather than presumptions arising from the fact of the deposit. It suggests that there is no logic in applying equitable presumptions, founded on the principles of part performance, to infer a security intention in transactions involving third party title documents. The fact that the parties to a loan advance may have intended <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> between themselves {{does not mean that the}} third party owner of the title documents also intended <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>mortgage.</b> In third party transactions, the objectives of the equity jurisdiction are best achieved through a comprehensive assessment of the intention of all parties and the abolition of presumptions based upon the bare fact of title deposit. <br /...|$|E

Ultimately, Denali FCU decided to purchase <b>an</b> Alaska <b>mortgage</b> firm rather than <b>create</b> <b>a</b> full-service <b>mortgage</b> department from scratch.” The purchase allowed Denali FCU to offer conventional investor-backed mortgage products, such as VA, FHA or AHFC loans, which it did not offer prior to the purchase of Northern Pacific Mortgage.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the prospects for}} securitization of real estate assets in Brazil. Brazilian real estate securitization is in its infancy. The economical importance of the country, its relatively well-developed financial markets, the globalization of capital markets, and the increasing demand for real estate securities, however, argues {{for the advancement of}} real estate securitization in Brazil. Real estate operations have been financed with debt and equity securities over the last years. On the debt side, the S. F. I. (Sistema Financeiro Imobiliario), an initiative designed to parallel the mortgage backed securities model in the U. S., is intended to broaden the supply of real estate financing in Brazil and <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> secondary <b>mortgage</b> market. Residential, industrial, commercial and other kinds of real estate loans will serve as collateral. One or more public issuers will buy and package mortgages to issue securities, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do in the U. S [...] The Brazilian government is not expected to provide subsidies or guarantees. Standardization and enhancement of legal guarantees on collateral are crucial concerns present in the S. F. I., under approval at the Federa...|$|R
40|$|Bearing in {{mind that}} land {{acquisition}} is very crucial to human development from ages past, the study examined private land acquisition processes and challenges encountered by individuals in Ado-odo/Ota Local government area of Ogun State. Using purposive sampling method, the study gathered relevant data from four different community leaders as well as four heads of family land owners {{with the aid of}} questionnaires and employed indepth interviews to solicit information from eight different youth leaders from the four selected communities. Four each of local artisans (bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers and electricians) available on sites under construction between March and May, 2014 were interviewed on their experiences within the selected neighbourhoods. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics while percentages and ranking were employed in analysis. Data presentation was basically in tables. The study found that because past governments had failed {{to take into account the}} needs and interests of individual, family or community land owners during earlier compulsory land acquisition processes, family land owners are in a hurry to sell off their land even when existing developments are far away. The study recommends that government needs to be proactive in designing new neighbourhood layouts to forestall large informal settlements and, at the same time, implement new methods of financing infrastructure to support urban land development. Finally, government needs <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> friendlier <b>mortgage</b> finance system that will make it possible for low-income households to acquire shelter or land at affordable prices...|$|R
50|$|On September 25, {{agreement}} {{was reported by}} congressional leaders on the basics of the package; however, general and vocal opposition to the proposal was voiced by the public. On Thursday afternoon at a White House meeting attended by congressional leaders and the presidential candidates, John McCain and Barack Obama, {{it became clear that}} there was no congressional consensus, with Republican representatives and the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, Richard C. Shelby, strongly opposing the proposal. The alternative advanced by conservative House Republicans was <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> system of <b>mortgage</b> insurance funded by fees on those holding mortgages; as the working week ended, negotiations continued on the plan, which had grown to 102 pages and included <b>mortgage</b> insurance as <b>an</b> option. On Thursday evening Washington Mutual, the nation's largest savings and loan, was seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and most of its assets transferred to JPMorgan Chase. Wachovia, one of the largest US banks, was reported to be in negotiations with Citigroup and other financial institutions.|$|R
40|$|U. S. {{policy makers}} often treat market {{competition}} as a panacea. However, {{in the case}} of mortgage securitization, policy makers’ faith in competition is misplaced. Competitive mortgage securitization has been tried three times in U. S. history— during the 1880 s, the 1920 s, and the 2000 s—and every time it has collapsed. Most recently, competition between mortgage securitizers led to a race to the bottom on mortgage underwriting standards that ended in the late 2000 s financial crisis. This Article provides original evidence that when competition was less intense and securitizers had more buyer power, securitizers acted to monitor mortgage originators and to maintain prudent underwriting. However, securitizers’ ability to monitor originators and maintain high standards was undermined as competition shifted power away from securitizers and toward originators. Although standards declined across the market, the largest and most powerful of the mortgage securitizers, the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), remained more successful than other mortgage securitizers at maintaining prudent underwriting. This Article proposes reforms based on lessons from the recent financial crisis: merge the GSEs with various government agencies’ <b>mortgage</b> operations <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> single dedicated <b>mortgage</b> securitization agency that would seek to maintain market stability, improve underwriting, and provide a long-term investment return for the benefit of taxpayers...|$|R

50|$|An {{equitable}} mortgage {{can arise}} {{in two different}} ways - either as <b>a</b> legal <b>mortgage</b> which was never perfected by conveying the underlying assets, or by specifically <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> as <b>an</b> equitable <b>mortgage.</b> <b>A</b> <b>mortgage</b> over equitable rights (such as a beneficiary's interests under a trust) will necessarily exist in equity only in any event.|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of real estate, {{the most common form}} of secured debt is the lien. Liens may either be voluntarily <b>created,</b> as with <b>a</b> <b>mortgage,</b> or involuntarily <b>created,</b> such as <b>a</b> {{mechanics}} lien. <b>A</b> <b>mortgage</b> may only be created with the express consent of the title owner, without regard to other facts of the situation. In contrast, the primary condition required <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> mechanics lien is that real estate is somehow improved through the work or materials provided by the person filing a mechanics lien. Although the rules are complex, consent of the title owner to the mechanics lien itself is not required.|$|R
