5|$|During a flyby on 26 September 2012, Cassinis radar {{detected}} in Titan's northern polar region {{what is likely}} a river with a length of more than 400 kilometers. It has been compared with the much larger Nile river on Earth. This feature is connected to Ligeia Mare. Later, a paper ("Liquid-filled Canyons on Titan") published on Geophysical Research Letters on 9 August 2016 reported about the May 2013 Cassini RADAR altimeter observation of Vid Flumina channels, defined as a drainage network connected to Titan's second largest hydrocarbon sea, Ligeia Mare. Analysis of the received altimeter echoes showed that the channels are located in deep (up to ~570 m), steep-sided, canyons and have strong specular surface reflections that indicate they are currently liquid filled. Elevations of the liquid in these channels are {{at the same level}} as Ligeia Mare to within a vertical precision of about 0.7 m, consistent with the interpretation of drowned river valleys. Specular reflections are also observed in lower order tributaries elevated above the level of Ligeia Mare, consistent with drainage feeding into the main channel system. This is likely the first direct evidence of the presence of liquid channels on Titan and the first observation of hundred-meter deep canyons on Titan. Vid Flumina canyons are thus drowned by the sea {{but there are a few}} isolated observations <b>to</b> <b>attest</b> to the presence of surface liquids standing at higher elevations.|$|E

25|$|Because {{it is used}} <b>to</b> <b>attest</b> the {{authority}} of its bearer, the ring has also {{been seen as a}} symbol of his power, which is one explanation for its inclusion in the regalia of certain monarchies.

25|$|While President Bush {{generally}} {{continued the}} deregulatory approach {{of his predecessor}} President Clinton, an important exception was the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, which followed high-profile corporate scandals at Enron, World Com, and Tyco International, among others.

25|$|The issuing {{authority}} may also require applicants <b>to</b> <b>attest</b> {{that they have}} had no criminal convictions, or that they do not partake in certain activities (like prostitution or drug trafficking). Some countries will deny visas if the travelers' passports show evidence of citizenship of, or travel to, a country which is considered hostile by that country. For example, some Arabic-oriented countries will not issue visas to nationals of Israel and those whose passports bear evidence of visiting Israel.|$|E

Aliens failing to make such an attestation would be ineligible for admission.

25|$|Henriques further {{argues that}} {{developing}} {{such a system}} for integrating knowledge {{is not just an}} academic enterprise. He suggests that in an increasingly complex world, the fragmented state of knowledge can be seen {{as one of the most}} pressing social problems of our time. Henriques also believes that history seems <b>to</b> <b>attest</b> that the absence of a collective worldview ostensibly condemns humanity to an endless series of conflicts that inevitably stem from incompatible, partially correct, locally situated justification systems. Thus, from Henriques' perspective, there are good reasons for believing that if there was a shared, general background of explanation, humanity might be able to achieve much greater levels of harmonious relations.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, most of Bessarabia returned to independence, as the Republic of Moldova. As of that moment, Pântea's name continues to be a subject of contention in the debates over Moldovan nationhood: a hero to the pro-unionists, he is largely ignored by the Moldovenists. This was noted in 2010 by unionist politician Mircea Druc, who assessed that, other than a commemorative plaque in Chișinău, there was little left <b>to</b> <b>attest</b> Pântea's significance to the Moldovan Republic. Nicolae Costin, who was Mayor of Chișinău between 1990 and 1994, reportedly sought to revive Pântea's urban projects (continued, after another long hiatus, by Dorin Chirtoacă).|$|E
25|$|Skeptics such as Paul Edwards have {{analyzed}} many {{of these}} accounts, and called them anecdotal, while also suggesting that claims of evidence for reincarnation originate from selective thinking and from the false memories that often result from one's own belief system and basic fears, and thus cannot be counted as empirical evidence. Carl Sagan referred to examples apparently from Stevenson's investigations in his book The Demon-Haunted World {{as an example of}} carefully collected empirical data, though he rejected reincarnation as a parsimonious explanation for the stories. Sam Harris cited Stevenson's works in his book The End of Faith as part of a body of data that seems <b>to</b> <b>attest</b> to the reality of psychic phenomena.|$|E

25|$|By 1779, the {{sizeable}} Catholic {{community in}} Dutch-administered Colombo had selected the hill at Kotahena {{to be the}} centre of worship. While there exist records of the Dutch government granting ten acres of land to these Catholics in 1779, there are no records <b>to</b> <b>attest</b> to the initiation of the small, thatched hut-like chapel that already existed on the land. This small and rustic structure {{is said to have}} been built by the Oratorian Fathers in 1760, although rumor puts the structure as being even older. A larger church of brick and mortar began construction under the guidance of Fr. Nicholas Rodriguez and Fr. Cosmo Antonio in 1782, with the aim of replacing the smaller structure. In 1796, the newly built church provided refuge for many citizens of the city when the invading British encamped across the Kelani river.|$|E
25|$|Both when {{encrypting}} {{messages and}} when verifying signatures, {{it is critical}} that the public key used to send messages to someone or some entity actually does 'belong' to the intended recipient. Simply downloading a public key from somewhere is not an overwhelming assurance of that association; deliberate (or accidental) impersonation is possible. From its first version, PGP has always included provisions for distributing user's public keys in an 'identity certificate', which is also constructed cryptographically so that any tampering (or accidental garble) is readily detectable. However, merely making a certificate which is impossible to modify without being detected is insufficient; this can prevent corruption only after the certificate has been created, not before. Users must also ensure by some means that the public key in a certificate actually does belong to the person or entity claiming it. From its first release, PGP products have included an internal certificate 'vetting scheme' to assist with this, a trust model which has been called a web of trust. A given public key (or more specifically, information binding a user name to a key) may be digitally signed by a third party user <b>to</b> <b>attest</b> to the association between someone (actually a user name) and the key. There are several levels of confidence which can be included in such signatures. Although many programs read and write this information, few (if any) include this level of certification when calculating whether to trust a key.|$|E
500|$|Highly {{intelligent}} women, {{according to}} the 12th century writings of Sharif al-Idrisi, {{were more likely to}} be lesbians; their intellectual prowess put them on a more even par with men. Relations between women who lived in harems, and fears of women being sexually intimate in Turkish baths were expressed in writings by men. Women, however, were mostly silent and men likewise rarely wrote about lesbian relationships. It is unclear to historians if the rare instances of lesbianism mentioned in literature are an accurate historical record or intended to serve as fantasies for men. A 1978 treatise about repression in Iran asserted that women were completely silenced: [...] "In the whole of Iranian history, [...] has been allowed to speak out for such tendencies ... <b>To</b> <b>attest</b> to lesbian desires would be an unforgivable crime." ...|$|E
