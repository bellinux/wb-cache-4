40|$|Abstract—To enhance {{installation}} security, a LNG {{storage in}} Rudong of Jiangsu province was adopted {{as a practical}} work, and it was analyzed by nonlinear finite element method to research overall and local stability performance, {{as well as the}} stress and deformation under the action of wind load and self-weight. Results indicate that deformation is tiny when steel mesh maintains as an overall ring, and stress caused by vertical bending moment and tension of bottom <b>tie</b> <b>wire</b> are also in the safe range. However, axial forces of lap reinforcement in adjacent steel mesh exceed the ultimate bearing capacity of <b>tie</b> <b>wire.</b> Hence, tie wires are ruptured; single mesh loses lateral connection and turns into monolithic status as the destruction of overall structure. Further more, monolithic steel mesh is led to collapse by the damage of bottom connection.

40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} was conducted to determine the bending capacity of high-strength reinforced concrete beams {{with the addition of}} three environmentally friendly synthetic fibers i. e., polypropylene fiber, <b>tie</b> <b>wire</b> fiber, and used rubber tires fiber. Four beams with a dimension of 15 x 30 x 220 cm were tested, including a beam for specimen without fiber as comparison. Specimens were designed to experience bending failure. Yield point of steel (fy) used for flexural and shear reinforcement was 407. 43 MPa. The diameter of flexural tensile reinforcement was 15. 8 mm, 11. 9 mm for the compressive reinforcement, as well as 11. 9 mm for the shear reinforcement. Concrete proportion incorporated 8 % silica fume and 1. 5 % polycarboxylate ethers based superplasticizer ViscoCrete 10 from the cement weight. The maximum diameter of split was 15. 9 mm, having 550 kg/m 3 cement content and w/c-ratio 0. 30. The target compressive strength was 70 MPa for cylinder 15 / 30 cm. The results showed that all beams experienced flexural failure as planned. Addition of fibers enhanced the bending behavior significantly, especially in flexural capacity, deflection and ductility. In comparison with high-strength reinforced concrete beam without fibers, the beam with polypropylene fiber had the increase of flexural strength of 115. 24 %, deflection of 306. 56 % and ductility of 298. 9 %; with <b>tie</b> <b>wire</b> fibers resulted in the increase of flexural strength of 117. 39 %, deflection of 160. 52 % and ductility of 148. 0 %; as well as with used rubber tires fiber produced the enhance of flexural strength of 112. 13 %, deflection of 184. 56 % and ductility of 178. 3 %. It can be concluded that the use of such environmentally friendly synthetic fibers can reduce the brittleness of high strength concrete, in which polypropylene fiber had delivered the best value and can be used very effectively than the other two types of fibers...|$|E

50|$|The mat {{is made of}} {{concrete}} which is an aggregate of small rocks and cement. This mixture has to be supported by a framework to avoid sagging and fracture while setting. This process is known as shuttering and reinforcing. The materials used are long twisted steel bars between the piles held in shape by thinner <b>tie</b> <b>wires.</b> Once this steel mat is laid, timber is attached around the perimeter to contain the wet concrete mixture. Once poured, (usually {{as a series of}} small loads), the concrete is stirred to remove any air pockets that might weaken the structure when set. The concrete undergoes a chemical change as it hardens and this produces a lot of heat. Sometimes, if the mass {{of concrete}} is very large, pipes carrying refrigerant coolant are used in the mass to assist the setting process to prevent the concrete from cracking.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{technical}} {{design of a}} novel experimental test facility, using haptic-enabled teleoperation of robotic manipulators, for live transmission line maintenance. The goal is to study and develop appropriate techniques in repair overhead power transmission lines by allowing linemen to wirelessly guide a remote manipulator, installed on a crane bucket, to execute dexterous maintenance tasks, such as twisting a <b>tie</b> <b>wire</b> around a cable. Challenges and solutions for developing such a system are outlined. The test facility consists of a PHANToM Desktop haptic device (master site), an industrial hydraulic manipulator (slave site) mounted atop a Stewart platform, and {{a wireless communication channel}} connecting the master and slave sites. The teleoperated system is tested under different force feedback schemes, while the base is excited and the communication channel is delayed and/or lossy to emulate realistic network behaviors. The force feedback schemes are: virtual fixture, augmentation force and augmented virtual fixture. Performance of each scheme is evaluated under three measures: task completion time, number of failed trials and displacement of the slave manipulator end-effector. The developed test rig {{has been shown to be}} successful in performing haptic-enabled teleoperation for live-line maintenance in a laboratory setting. The authors aim at establishing a benchmark test facility for objective evaluation of ideas and concepts in the teleoperation of live-line maintenance tasks.

40|$|The {{alkali metal}} {{thermoelectric}} converter (AMI~C) {{is a direct}} energy conversion device, utilizing a high-Na activity gradient across a beta"-alumina solid electrolyte (BASE). (i- 3) Mo electrodes,- 2. 5 ~m thick containing Na 2 MoO 4 have performed for {{short periods of time}} (~i 0 hours) at nearly ideal levels, delivering ~I. 0 W/cm 2 at- 1200 K; but until recently, reproducible sustained power levels greater than 0. 3 W/cm 2 were not achieved. Other electrodes as d iv ~ as 0. 5 -~n Mm, TiN, liquid Sn, and WPt or WRh have recently demonstrated sustained performance at ~ 0. 5 W/cm 2 at Ii 00 to 1200 K. (4 - 6) We have achieved sustained power densities of ~ 0. 7 W/cm 2 through partial optimization of WPt and WRh alloy electrodes. An efficient AMTEC electrode must have low sheet resistance, RSH; a high exchange cur-rent, J~o, (referenced here to 0 V vs Na /BASE); and a low sodium vapor diffusion resistance, RD, which directly depends on a dimensionless morphology parameter, G. (7) The series ohmic resistance, RSER, contains contributions from RSH, as well as the elec-trode to Ni mesh contact resistance and BASE ionic resistance, RBASE. The requirements of low RSH and R D conflict since thick, con-tinuous electrodes provide low RSH and thin, porous electrodes provide low RD, if diffusion is controlled by free-molecular flow. Favor-able interfacial kinetics requ/res films in good contact with the BASE surface. Good mass transport characteristics can be obtained in oxide-free Mo or W electrodes which exhibit mass transport controlled by Knudsen flow if they are- 0. 6 ~m or less thick.
