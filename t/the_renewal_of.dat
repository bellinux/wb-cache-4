5|$|Canopus {{served in}} the Mediterranean Fleet upon {{commissioning}} until 1903, when she was decommissioned for refitting. In 1905, she was sent to East Asia, but <b>the</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> the Anglo-Japanese Alliance that year rendered her presence in Asian waters unnecessary. She instead returned to Britain and served with several fleet commands in British waters, including the Atlantic Fleet, the Channel Fleet, and finally the Home Fleet. Another short deployment to the Mediterranean followed in 1908–1909. Upon returning to Britain, she was placed in reserve.|$|E

5|$|In the end, Kennedy {{managed to}} amend <b>the</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 to include {{provisions}} {{for a national}} survey on nutrition.

5|$|The {{scholars}} Pratapaditya Pal, {{an expert}} on South Asian art and H. Bhattacharya, author of Hinduder Debdebi {{on the subject of}} Hindu deities, equate Chhinnamasta with the concepts of sacrifice and <b>the</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> creation. Chhinnamasta sacrifices herself, and her blood– drunk by her attendants– nourishes the universe. One invocation to her calls her the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and the recipient of the sacrifice, with the severed head treated as an offering. This paradox signifies the entire sacrificial process, and thus the cycle of creation, dissolution, and re-creation.|$|E
5|$|Along with <b>the</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> {{the civil}} war in 1352, these factors {{destroyed}} any chance of even a modest recovery similar to that experienced under Andronikos III. Thereafter, Byzantium remained under the menacing threat of stronger neighbours, unable to pursue an independent foreign policy, handicapped by a shortage of resources and riven by internal strife. Nevertheless, through a combination of fortuitous external circumstances and adroit diplomacy, it survived for another century, until finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1453. Only the Byzantine exclave in the Morea remained prosperous, having been spared the ravages of {{the civil war}} because of its relative isolation. The appointment of Manuel Kantakouzenos as its despotes in 1349 heralded the creation of the semi-independent Despotate of the Morea, which experienced the last economic and cultural flowering of the Byzantine world before it too fell to the Ottomans in 1460.|$|E
5|$|In 1147 Manuel {{was faced}} with war by Roger II of Sicily, whose fleet had {{captured}} the Byzantine island of Corfu and plundered Thebes and Corinth. However, despite being distracted by a Cuman attack in the Balkans, in 1148 Manuel enlisted the alliance of Conrad III of Germany, and {{the help of the}} Venetians, who quickly defeated Roger with their powerful fleet. In 1149, Manuel recovered Corfu and prepared to take the offensive against the Normans, while Roger II sent George of Antioch with a fleet of 40 ships to pillage Constantinople's suburbs. Manuel had already agreed with Conrad on a joint invasion and partition of southern Italy and Sicily. <b>The</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> the German alliance remained the principal orientation of Manuel's foreign policy {{for the rest of his}} reign, despite the gradual divergence of interests between the two empires after Conrad's death.|$|E

5|$|In April 1903 a {{petition}} objecting to <b>the</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> alcohol licences for local inns, signed by 450 people, {{was presented to}} the Brewsters sessions (magistrates court meetings in England where pub licences were renewed or granted). A deputation sent to the session explained that the number of licensed houses was too large in proportion to the population. In 1917, the cattle market moved from the Higher Bullring to a field near the station. The first cinema was opened in the Victoria Hall in 1918 by Bill Terry and in 1977 the town was twinned with Ploudalmézeau in Brittany, France.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, lenders {{warned that}} {{time was running out}} for a deal to be agreed on a new bailout plan.

The {{deadline}} for <b>the</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> Greece's bailout package was also looming at the end of June. On 26 June, an emergency cabinet meeting led to the calling of a referendum on the bailout deal proposed by the creditors. Capital controls and a bank holiday were announced on 28 June, with the Eurozone refusing an extension of the bailout plan and Greece defaulting on its loan to the IMF on 30 June.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> Arab invasions, {{and to a}} sequence of natural disasters such as the eruptions of the volcanic island of Thera, the Emperor Leo III the Isaurian concluded that the Empire had lost divine favour. Already in 722 {{he had tried to}} force the conversion of the Empire's Jews, but soon he began to turn his attention to the veneration of icons, which some bishops had come to regard as idolatrous. In 726, Leo published an edict condemning their use and showed himself increasingly critical of the iconophiles. He formally banned depictions of religious figures in a court council in 730.|$|E

The peace treaty was to be followed up by the Congress of Rastatt. Campo Formio's terms held until 1798, when both groups recovered their military strength and began the War of the Second Coalition. Despite <b>the</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> military action, the Congress continued its meetings in Rastatt until the assassination of the French delegation in April 1799.|$|E
5|$|On 21June 1951, White {{resigned}} from parliament to become Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, {{a position he}} held until 1956. He was succeeded as the member for Balaclava by Liberal Percy Joske. White was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in January 1952. As High Commissioner he advocated continued British migration to Australia and participated in <b>the</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> the assisted passage scheme {{between the two countries}} in 1954. He suffered from emphysema and on 13October 1957 {{died of a heart attack}} at his home in the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra. Survived by his wife and four daughters, he was accorded a state funeral at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne, and interred at Point Lonsdale cemetery.

5|$|The Fasci Siciliani , {{short for}} Fasci Siciliani dei Lavoratori (Sicilian Workers Leagues), were a popular {{movement}} of democratic and socialist inspiration, which arose in Sicily {{in the years}} between 1889 and 1894. The Fasci gained {{the support of the}} poorest and most exploited classes of the island by channeling their frustration and discontent into a coherent programme based on the establishment of new rights. Consisting of a jumble of traditionalist sentiment, religiosity, and socialist consciousness, the movement reached its apex in the summer of 1893, when new conditions were presented to the landowners and mine owners of Sicily concerning <b>the</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> sharecropping and rental contracts.|$|E

Only when the investigated person or the police refuse to deal with the misdemeanor on the spot, is an administrative proceeding before a municipal misdemeanor committee initiated and if convicted, then a record of it is made by the municipality.|$|E
5|$|When {{the goddess}} is at last placated, the {{retrieving}} god escorts {{her back to}} Egypt. Her return {{marks the beginning of}} the inundation and the new year. The pacified Eye deity is once more a procreative consort for the sun god, or, in some versions of the story, for the god who brings her back. Mehit becomes the consort of Anhur, Tefnut is paired with Shu, and Thoth's spouse is sometimes Nehemtawy, a minor goddess associated with this pacified form of the Eye. In many cases, the Eye goddess and her consort then produce a divine child who becomes the new sun god. The goddess' transformation from hostile to peaceful is a key step in <b>the</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> the sun god and the kingship that he represents.|$|E
5|$|When {{the great}} bell rings out every full hour, {{struck by a}} large clockwork-operated hammer, passers-by see a gilded figure in full harness moving its arm to strike it.
