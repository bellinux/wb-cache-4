5|$|Black {{doubts that}} Winston is the killer, and while Hollis {{stays in the}} hotel, he visits the production's climactic shoot, set during a {{performance}} by the band Kiss. As he looks around him, the sheriff's body is thrown down from the rafters; as the pandemonium settles, Black realizes that horror films end with the leading lady being targeted—the killer is after Hollis. Racing back to her hotel, Black discover Hollis fending off a chainsaw-wielding Bianco. Black is able to subdue Bianco after Hollis disables the chainsaw; the actor then explains that he lacked Black's insight and had to commit the crimes in order <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> eyes of a killer.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Fauxlivia and Lincoln track Dr. Silva's location, an {{abandoned}} building, and separate. Dr. Silva locks Lincoln {{in a cold}} storage room, while Fauxlivia falls through a weakened floor and passes out. She is woken by Dr. Silva, but finds herself secured to a chair. Dr. Silva explains to Fauxlivia that he wants <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> end of his research, needing only one more human host for a final gestation cycle to birth the queen beetle from which the beetle species, and his cure, can be sustained. Fauxlivia feels pains in her body when Dr. Silva implies the last cycle has begun, believing herself to be the host.|$|E
50|$|Fiberglass solar screens provide over 75% of UV protection, {{by using}} thicker strands and a closer mesh than regular 18x14 {{fiberglass}} window screening. There is some reduction in visibility, but {{this can be}} advantageous, since Solar Screens are difficult <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> from <b>the</b> outside, while easier <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> from <b>the</b> inside.|$|R

5|$|When Joan {{comes to}} speak with Charles, the Dauphin pretends to be a common member of the court while someone else pretends to be him. Joan is able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ruse and {{immediately}} proclaims that she is sent to restore the French crown to him at Rheims. Charles has her examined by priests and scholars to determine that she is free of black magic. While questioned, Joan describes how God came to her with visions and describes her faith {{in a similar manner}} to deism. This causes the examiners to believe that she is a heretic until a blue flame appears along with a sound, which is enough to silence any doubts about her faith. The flame reveals a suit of armour for her, but one individual interrupts her immediate donning of the armour to claim that France is cursed and that she would be a victim. The individual, as it turns out, is Conrade, who blames himself that Joan left her peaceful life to help a French court that was corrupt. He also warns her that he experienced a vision of her burning at the stake.|$|E

25|$|On {{his return}} Robertson wrote Haig an equivocal letter (27 September) stating that he {{stuck to his}} advice to {{concentrate}} effort on the Western Front rather than Palestine out of instinct and lack of any alternative than from any convincing argument. He also wrote that “Germany may be much nearer {{the end of her}} staying power than available evidence shows” but that given French and Italian weakness it was “not an easy business <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> problem”.|$|E
25|$|A louvred door has {{fixed or}} movable wooden fins (often called slats or louvers) which permit open {{ventilation}} while preserving privacy and preventing {{the passage of}} light to the interior. Being relatively weak structures, they are most commonly used for wardrobes and drying rooms, where security is of less importance than good ventilation, although a very similar structure is commonly used to form window shutters. Double louvred doors were introduced into Seagate, built in Florida in 1929 by Gwendolyn and Powel Crosley, that provided the desired circulation of air with an added degree of privacy {{in that it is}} impossible <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> fins in any direction.|$|E
500|$|As he {{was leaving}} his post in 1975, further {{criticism}} was directed at Morton for his overseeing the partial dismantling of the Interior Department.

500|$|Critics {{have been}} divided on whether Barth {{identified}} with the narrator's beliefs; this appeared probable to John Gardner, Richard W. Noland, and Tony Tanner, while Beverly Gross and Campbell Tatham believed the tragic ending demonstrates the contrary. [...] Philosopher Robert C. Solomon included excerpts from the book in a collection on existentialism. [...] Gardner objected to the book's absurdist philosophy, [...] "vulgarities of style", and a [...] "touch of life-hate which reveals itself in the author's fascination with the ugly, the disgusting"; Gardner found this [...] "fascination" [...] perplexing, as [...] "in other respects Barth seems all sunshine and good cheer". [...] Christopher Conti saw a [...] "moral-satiric design" [...] also found in Nabokov's Lolita (1955) and Gardner's Grendel (1971), in which the reader is meant <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> moral failings of the novels' [...] "monstrous narrators".|$|E
500|$|Moore {{played the}} {{supporting}} role of President Alma Coin, {{the leader of}} a rebellion against The Capitol, in the third installment of the lucrative Hunger Games film series, [...] The film ranks as her highest-grossing to date. Her final appearance of 2014 {{was one of the most}} acclaimed of her career. In the drama Still Alice, Moore played the leading role of a linguistics professor diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease. She spent four months training for the film, by watching documentaries on the disease and interacting with patients at the Alzheimer's Association. Critic David Thomson wrote that Moore was [...] "extraordinary at revealing the gradual loss of memory and confidence", while according to Kenneth Turan she was [...] "especially good at the wordless elements of this transformation, allowing us <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> changing contours of her face what it is like when your mind empties out." [...] Several critics commented that it was her finest performance to date, and Moore was awarded with the Oscar, Golden Globe, SAG and BAFTA for Best Actress.|$|E
500|$|Murdock {{begins the}} season {{wearing a black}} costume (called the [...] "vigilante outfit" [...] by production), {{inspired}} by the one worn by the character in Frank Miller's The Man Without Fear, rather than the more traditional red, horned suit. This was done to highlight the formation of Matt Murdock as Daredevil, with the costume evolving over time as the character develops. Marvel Comics' Chief Creative Officer Quesada conceptualized the look based on DeKnight's specifications. On the design process, DeKnight revealed that [...] "we tried practically everything, design-wise. We experimented {{with a lot of}} different head pieces. One version was a ski mask with the eyes sewn shut. We tried everything until we found something that just felt right." [...] DeKnight and Quesada explained that the idea was for Murdock to start out with a homemade outfit that fits more in the [...] "real-world" [...] of the series, and to then evolve it into the classic Daredevil suit. Maslansky noted that they wanted the outfit to [...] "look like something that Matt Murdock could put together himself, that he could either order off the Internet or shop around town....we wound up with pretty practical choices for him. His shirts are compression shirts and his pants wound up being from an army/navy store." [...] Concerning the black mask, Maslansky noted that a balance between aesthetic and safety was required, and that it was made of layers of cotton mesh that [...] "really conform to his head" [...] but also allowed Cox <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mask.|$|E

500|$|Many {{projects}} were mooted since the 1990s for establishing museums {{of communism in}} Sofia, Dimitrovgrad, and Haskovo, but none came to fruition. During the same period, many monuments of the Soviet regime were destroyed or dismantled. During the summer of 2011 attempts to create exhibits {{on the role of}} the communist regime in Bulgaria were made by a group of artists who painted [...] "pop icons" [...] on the Soviet army memorial in Sofia in June 2011. At that point, the government decided to establish museums in Bulgaria and also to restore dismantled monuments. The establishment of the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Museum of Ancient Sofia, and the National Museum Complex (renamed as [...] "the Bulgarian Louvre") came to be established in Sofia as a result of that decision. At the same time it was decided by Ministry of Culture to create the Museum of Socialist Art in Sofia to enhance the city's cultural ambiance and its position as a major tourist attraction, in conformity with similarly themed museums that had been established in many cities of Eastern Europe. It was also considered and accepted by the ministry that the museum would be a subsidiary of the National Gallery of Art. Vezhdi Rashidov, the Minister of Culture, himself a sculptor, took the initiative <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> project of creating the museum for exhibiting the artistic heritage of the communist regime. The Government of Bulgaria fully supported the initiative [...] and provided funds to the extent of 1.5 million euros to establish the museum, hoping that the revenue from the sale of entry tickets would recover this cost in a period of 2 years. The remnants of the socialist regime were found from basement of very town in Bulgaria for installation at the museum before it formally opened on 19 September 2011.|$|E

Samatha means [...] "to make skillful", and has other renderings, among which are [...] "tranquilizing, calming", [...] "visualizing", and [...] "achieving". Vipassanā means [...] "insight" [...] or [...] "abstract understanding". In this context, Samatha Meditation makes a person skillful in concentration of mind. Once the mind is sufficiently concentrated, vipassanā allows one <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> veil of ignorance.|$|E

2500|$|The {{artificial}} intelligence has two modes of operation: basic and advanced. Basic algorithms are not CPU-intensive, {{but are not}} as good as the advanced ones. The chance of using advanced algorithms for a decision – the intelligence factor – varies between difficulty levels. At [...] "challenging", this factor reaches 100%. Some low difficulty levels prohibit the AI from using combat magic, and penalize their economy, hit points and/or starting funds. At higher levels, the AI acquires bonuses; the highest permits the AI <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> fog of war.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to regular school subjects, Babel studied the Talmud and music. According to Cynthia Ozick, [...] "Though {{he was at}} home in Yiddish and Hebrew, and was familiar with the traditional texts and their demanding commentaries, he added to these a lifelong fascination with Maupassant and Flaubert. His first stories were composed in fluent literary French. The breadth and scope of his social compass enabled him <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> eyes of peasants, soldiers, priests, rabbis, children, artists, actors, women of all classes. He befriended whores, cabdrivers, jockeys; he knew {{what it was like to}} be penniless, to live on the edge and off the beaten track." ...|$|E
2500|$|An unanticipated {{result of}} the steel fencing {{installed}} to secure the previously open gangways at Cabrini–Green was that it became difficult for Chicago police officers <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> steel mesh from outside. On July 17, 1970, Chicago police patrolman Anthony N. Rizzato and Sergeant James Severin were {{shot and killed by}} gang members while patrolling community housing for an all-volunteer [...] "Walk and Talk" [...] project. As the officers proceeded across the Cabrini–Green baseball field, the assailants opened fire from an apartment window. The purpose of the shooting was to seal a pact between two rival gangs. Both officers were killed in the attack. Three adults and one juvenile were later charged with murder. The two shooters were sentenced to 100–199 years in prison for two counts of murder. In 1981, the gang killings of 11 made national attention.|$|E
