5|$|The party {{arrived at}} the vicarage to be greeted by Mrs Blackburne. (Mrs Blackburne had {{originally}} intended to travel on the inaugural journey with her husband, but the previous day had felt a presentiment {{that something was wrong}} at home and her presence was required, and had returned alone by boat. She had then heard a rumour that a mob from Oldham were planning to storm the track at Eccles to attack the Duke of Wellington, and decided to remain in the vicarage.) Huskisson was moved to <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> <b>and</b> given laudanum and brandy. At about 2.00pm Hunter and Brandreth cut Huskisson's clothing away from his damaged leg to give it a proper examination. Unfamiliar with industrial injuries, they were baffled {{by the nature of the}} damage to Huskisson's leg, but concluded that despite the apparent severity of his injuries the wounds were treatable.|$|E
25|$|White Room: usually as {{themselves}} (Dawn & Jennifer) {{in a white}} living room; Dawn always {{enters with}} an outrageous assertion about herself, while Jennifer usually sits on <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> makes her feel unwelcome.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} scene, Nicola packs her suitcases, Ambrose {{returning}} with his father's unpacked suitcase, Dan {{sits at the}} bar with his drink, Charlotte opens a folder at her desk, and Imogen joins Stewart on <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> they comfort each other. As Imogen switches off the TV, the play ends.|$|E

60|$|So {{they all}} clambered out of <b>the</b> <b>sofas</b> <b>and</b> {{followed}} <b>the</b> Captain toward the palace--even the Saw-Horse taking {{his place in}} the queer procession.|$|R
60|$|Then Dot sat {{upon one}} of <b>the</b> <b>sofas,</b> <b>and</b> heard <b>the</b> strains of a {{military}} band, seemingly far away, but sounding sweetly and distinctly, nevertheless.|$|R
25|$|Sleepwalking Sleepwalking {{can lead}} to bedwetting. During sleepwalking, the sleepwalker may think he/she is in another room. When the sleepwalker urinates during a sleepwalking episode, he/she usually thinks {{they are in the}} bathroom, and {{therefore}} urinate where they think the toilet should be. Cases of this have included opening a closet and urinating in it; urinating on <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> simply urinating {{in the middle of the}} room.|$|E
25|$|The Tuileries Palace, {{city hall}} of Paris, {{and many other}} public {{buildings}} had been burned by the Commune or damaged in the fighting, but the Odéon was still intact. Charles-Marie Chilly, the co-director of the Odéon, came to her apartment, where Bernhardt received him reclining on a sofa. He announced that the theater would reopen in October 1871, and {{he asked her to}} play the lead in a new play, Jean-Marie by André Theuriet. Bernhardt replied that she was finished with the theater and was going to move to Brittany and start a farm. Chilly, who knew Bernhardt's moods well, told her that he understood and accepted her decision, and would give the role to Jane Essler, a rival actress. According to Chilly, Bernhardt immediately jumped up from <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> asked when the rehearsals would begin.|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} verse, Lewis and Haynes are seen having several embraces, some joyful {{while others are}} more tense as Lewis is sad. The couple are then seen leaving the party; Haynes walks over to Lewis and attempts to kiss, but she proceeds to push him away. During the second airing of the chorus, more images of happy scenes between the couple are spliced with Lewis waking up in bed to find Haynes has slept on the sofa. More passionate embraces between the couple are seen before Lewis is seen breaking down in tears. At the breakfast that follows, the couple break {{into a series of}} arguments. Lewis shoves Haynes onto <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> <b>and</b> Haynes grabs Lewis as she turns away. Lewis then slaps Hayne around the face. During the middle eight breakdown in the song, [...] Haynes throws books from a shelf, and Lewis throws objects at Haynes including a cushion, as well as pushing over a lamp. Haynes subsequently leaves, driving away into the distance, and Lewis falls to the wall and breaks down in tears.|$|E
30|$|There were no {{relationships}} between the lymphocyte count <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>SOFA</b> score, <b>and</b> between <b>the</b> delta of <b>the</b> <b>SOFA</b> score <b>and</b> <b>the</b> variations in the lymphocyte counts. This result is consistent with our results about the independent role of immune paralysis and organ failures.|$|R
60|$|The Woggle-Bug {{declared}} he was sea-sick; and Tip {{was also}} pale and somewhat distressed. But the others {{clung to the}} backs of <b>the</b> <b>sofas</b> <b>and</b> {{did not seem to}} mind the motion {{as long as they were}} not tipped out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God, {{the night}} is over," [...] Frank said at last; [...] "and I have {{thoroughly}} tired myself. I have thought until I am stupid. Now I will lie {{down on one of}} <b>the</b> <b>sofas,</b> <b>and</b> perhaps I may forget it all for a few hours." ...|$|R
500|$|Several {{witnesses}} later {{reported that}} they heard a loud gunshot at approximately 15:30. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, opened the study door with Bormann at his side. Linge later stated that he immediately noted a scent of burnt almonds, which is a common observation {{in the presence of}} prussic acid (the aqueous form of hydrogen cyanide). Hitler's adjutant, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Günsche, entered the study and found the two lifeless bodies on the sofa. Eva, with her legs drawn up, was to Hitler's left and slumped away from him. Günsche stated that Hitler [...] "... sat... sunken over, with blood dripping out of his right temple. He had shot himself with his own pistol, a Walther PPK 7.65". The gun lay at his feet and according to SS-Oberscharführer Rochus Misch, Hitler's head was lying {{on the table in front}} of him. Blood dripping from Hitler's right temple and chin had made a large stain on the right arm of <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> was pooling on the carpet. According to Linge, Eva's body had no visible physical wounds, and her face showed how she had died—by cyanide poisoning. Günsche and SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke stated [...] "unequivocally" [...] that all outsiders and those performing duties and work in the bunker [...] "did not have any access" [...] to Hitler's private living quarters during the time of death (between 15:00 and 16:00).|$|E
2500|$|When Justin's mother, Arabella, finally arrives, it {{is without}} her [...] "man-friend" [...] Olaf, who was ditched en route. Very drunk, she {{mistakes}} Paige for Justin's fiancée and says Justin has finally struck gold. When Justin eventually manages {{to point out}} which girl Julie-Ann really is, she says [...] "He's done it again! Another bloody dog." [...] Julie-Ann leaves in tears, Arabella collapses on <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> <b>and</b> the Act closes with Justin cheerfully saying [...] "Soup anyone?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1894–1896 renovations to the Deanery, Lockwood de Forest {{transformed}} the original living room into a study for M. Carey Thomas, {{which came to}} be known as the [...] "Blue Room," [...] referring to the room's dark blue walls. The decoration of the Blue Room was inspired by Japanese art, a departure from the East Indian influence that permeates the majority of de Forest's designs in the Deanery. The celebrated gold designs that de Forest stenciled on the ceiling were reminiscent of Japanese textiles, and the spiked flowers of the Japanese pagoda tree were the model for the stencil designs on <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> daybed. Throughout the Blue Room a number of small works of art were also on display, including etchings by the nineteenth-century artists James Abbott McNeill Whistler and Charles Méryon, and a fifteenth-century bronze bust of Dante Alighieri.|$|E

2500|$|At the [...] "Develop" [...] {{conference in}} July 2012, Perry {{released}} a statement that he's {{sure there will be}} another Earthworm Jim game. He claimed the problem was [...] "when", not [...] "if", as, while the development team members discuss the project actively, they are all busy with their separate projects and companies. A possible premise he outlined was, [...] "The thing we had talked about in the past is Jim had been in retirement...So, he's been sitting at home watching movies and eating popcorn. He's grossly overweight now. The plan was to start with him literally getting off <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> <b>and</b> it's a disaster because he just hasn't done anything since. But he's got to get back into action again." [...] While details regarding just how much Jim being out of shape would affect game design are still up in the air, Perry mentioned being pretty certain that the game would be played in 2D.|$|E
2500|$|This {{adds another}} mystery – who did kill Costello? Pippa is helped {{to lie on}} <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> Clarissa is {{suddenly}} struck by something Hugo said earlier when he stated that Sellon's antique shop was called [...] "Sellon and Brown". She remembers the phone call asking for Mrs. Brown and a comment made by Costello to Miss Peake before she showed him from {{the house to the}} effect that he came [...] "to see Mrs. Brown" [...] and she realises that Miss Peake is in fact Mrs. Brown, Sellon's former partner. Clarissa was given the rent of the house cheaply to install another Mrs Brown to lure other fortune hunters who are after Sellon's unknown amazing discovery. She laughs off the apparent danger she put Clarissa in stating that she kept a very close eye on things, such as her being on the scene when Costello was threatening her earlier in the evening.|$|E
2500|$|Next, Karen learns {{through the}} French {{newspapers}} that Max has committed suicide, and Naomi arrives in London, where she explains {{the circumstances surrounding}} his death: after receiving his letter and informing Mme Fisher of his intentions, Naomi is quarantined by her mother, who intends to keep Naomi from seeing Max and removing any possibility of spoiling Max's chance for happiness with Karen. Max does visit Naomi, however, speaking to her of the failure inherent in his relationship with Karen: [...] "'What she and I are' he said, 'is outside life; we shall fail.'" [...] He is visibly distressed as Mme Fisher returns to the salon. [...] Naomi returns to her upstairs bedroom. There is a commotion in the salon, and Naomi returns to find her mother strewn across <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> blood on the floor. Max has cut his own wrist, making his {{way out the door}} into the street, and dying in an alley. In the following days, Mme Fisher will observe that [...] "it was the commendation he could not bear. I was commending him when he took his knife out." [...] At the end of the section, Karen reveals to Naomi that she is pregnant with Max's child, and will leave for Germany to try to avoid any scandal.|$|E
6000|$|Then Tip's {{fears were}} {{proven to be}} well founded; for with the first streaks of gray dawn they looked over the sides of <b>the</b> <b>sofas</b> <b>and</b> {{discovered}} rolling plains dotted with queer villages, where the houses, instead of being dome- shaped--as they all are in the Land of Oz--had slanting roofs that rose to a peak ...|$|R
