25|$|Drinks {{especially}} high in simple sugars, such as {{soft drinks and}} fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase dehydration. A <b>too</b> <b>rich</b> solution in the gut draws water {{from the rest of}} the body, just as if the person were to drink sea water. Plain water may be used if more specific and effective ORT preparations are unavailable or are not palatable. Additionally, a mix of both plain water and drinks perhaps <b>too</b> <b>rich</b> in sugar and salt can alternatively be given to the same person, with the goal of providing a medium amount of sodium overall. A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{carburetor}} {{leaves a}} stable condition, the float {{is influenced by}} both gravity and inertia, resulting in inaccurate fuel metering {{and a reduction in}} engine performance as the air-fuel ratio changes, becoming either too lean or <b>too</b> <b>rich</b> for maximum engine performance, and in some cases, stopping the engine.|$|E
25|$|Like other hydrocarbons, {{gasoline}} {{burns in}} a limited range of its vapor phase and, coupled with its volatility, this makes leaks highly dangerous when sources of ignition are present. Gasoline has a lower explosive limit of 1.4% by volume and an upper explosive limit of 7.6%. If the concentration is below 1.4%, the air-gasoline mixture is too lean and does not ignite. If the concentration is above 7.6%, the mixture is <b>too</b> <b>rich</b> and also does not ignite. However, gasoline vapor rapidly mixes and spreads with air, making unconstrained gasoline quickly flammable.|$|E

50|$|The {{gas mixture}} is {{controlled}} by the diver in manually controlled closed circuit rebreathers. The diver can manually control the mixture by adding diluent gas or oxygen. Adding diluent can prevent the loop gas mixture becoming <b>too</b> oxygen <b>rich,</b> and adding oxygen is done to increase oxygen concentration.|$|R

25|$|The Global Peace Foundation {{proposed}} to raze the prison {{and build a}} peace center in its place. During the previous year, supporters collected 10,350 signatures that {{placed it on the}} presidential primary ballots in San Francisco for February 5, 2008. The proposed plan was estimated at $1 billion. For the plan to pass, Congress would have to have taken Alcatraz out of the National Park Service. Critics of the plan said that Alcatraz is <b>too</b> <b>rich</b> in history to be destroyed. On February 6, 2008, the Alcatraz Island Global Peace Center Proposition C failed to pass, with 72% of voters rejecting the proposition.|$|E
25|$|Coke {{is a solid}} {{carbonaceous}} residue derived from coking coal (a low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal, also known as metallurgical coal), which is used in manufacturing steel and other iron products. Coke is made from coking coal by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1,000°C (1,832°F), driving off the volatile constituents and fusing together the fixed carbon and residual ash. Metallurgical coke {{is used as a}} fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace. The result is pig iron, and is <b>too</b> <b>rich</b> in dissolved carbon, so it must be treated further to make steel.|$|E
25|$|Filling {{cylinders}} with {{a mixture}} of gases has dangers for both the filler and the diver. During filling there is a risk of fire due to use of oxygen and a risk of explosion due to the use of high-pressure gases. The composition of the mix must be safe for the depth and duration of the planned dive. If the concentration of oxygen is too lean the diver may lose consciousness due to hypoxia and if it is <b>too</b> <b>rich</b> the diver may suffer oxygen toxicity. The concentration of inert gases, such as nitrogen and helium, are planned and checked to avoid nitrogen narcosis and decompression sickness.|$|E

25|$|The inverse is {{also true}} when the {{aircraft}} is in inverted flight. The float becomes submerged as the fuel is pulled downward by gravity {{to the top of}} the fuel bowl. The float lifts upward toward the bottom of the inverted fuel bowl. With the float at the bottom of the fuel bowl, the fuel inlet valve opens, as it would when there is not enough fuel in the fuel bowl. With the fuel inlet valve open, the fuel pump continues pumping fuel into the fuel bowl, where the resulting excess fuel causes the fuel-air ratio to become lower than nine to one, which is then <b>too</b> <b>rich</b> for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|E
25|$|Brown bear (grizzly) Ursus arctos horribilis (taqukaq, carayak Yup'ik and Cup'ik, paugnar in Cup'ig) and Black bear Ursus americanus (tan'gerliq in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, tungulzria in Cup'ig) were {{harvested}} {{for food}} (meat and fat). Bear meat (tan'gerlim kemga) made into jerky was often dried {{over a couple}} of weeks time. The internal organs, such as heart, kidneys, and intestines were often distributed to elders. Both black and brown bear meat was considered very tasty and was prepared by drying, boiling, baking, and roasting. The bones were boiled so that all of the meat could easily be removed from them. The marrow was only occasionally used because the bones are very thick and not easily broken. The liver was considered to be <b>too</b> <b>rich</b> and was not eaten.|$|E
25|$|The Bene Gesserit {{choose to}} use {{indirect}} methodologies to further their goals, rather than wield overt power themselves. They have noted the Taoist principle that whatever rises must fall; and so rather than taking direct control of the human race, they instead manipulate {{the social and political}} order with subtlety and insinuation, often using extraordinarily long-term stratagems spanning generations. The Bene Gesserit avoid appearing <b>too</b> <b>rich</b> or powerful, or revealing the extent of their powers, to prevent being seen as overtly responsible for {{the rise and fall of}} governments and empires, and to avoid any organized backlash. To this end, the Bene Gesserit provide some of their trained initiates as wives and concubines, and will train the daughters of noble families for a fee.|$|E

25|$|The {{need for}} body {{satisfaction}} and appearance esteem {{continues to increase}} with the abundance of; billboards, magazines, and conversations, displaying “unrealistic images of beauty” (LiveLifeGetActive, 2016). Weight prejudices {{brought up in the}} media or social settings are also prevalent within society. The tendency to link physical attractive qualities with positive personal qualities has been documented since the 1970s. People assign positive personality traits and overall life outcomes to those they perceive as attractive both mentally and physically. The very thin and beautiful models within the media are therefore seen as the most successful and socially desirable people on the planet. In most societies, thinness is typically associated with happiness, success, youthfulness, and social acceptability.  This ideal is heavily portrayed throughout the mainstream media, whereby women are assumed to be perfect in every way. In addition, the idea that a person can never be too thin or <b>too</b> <b>rich,</b> makes it difficult for females to attain any sort of happiness about their personal appearance. Hence, a women’s attitude towards her body are thus a result of comparing it with those depicted in the media, along with society’s obsession with thinness.|$|E
25|$|The {{show has}} had an {{extended}} and sporadic run. The first three series were broadcast on the BBC from 1992 to 1995, followed by a series finale {{in the form of}} a two-part television film entitled The Last Shout in 1996. Creator Jennifer Saunders revived the show for a fourth series in 2001, after having written and submitted a pilot entitled Mirrorball, which recruited nearly all of the original cast in new roles. The pilot was intended to be turned into a series of episodes. However, Saunders felt the characters were far <b>too</b> <b>rich</b> and interesting to put aside, and were far better suited for her new story ideas. Instead of Mirrorball, a new series of Absolutely Fabulous was proposed to the BBC, which later commissioned the fourth series in 2001. From 2001 to 2004, two full series were produced, along with three one-off hour-long specials; Gay (retitled and issued as Absolutely Fabulous in New York for the United States) in 2002, Cold Turkey, a Christmas special in 2003, and White Box (another series finale), which aired in 2004. A Comic Relief sketch was broadcast in 2005.|$|E
500|$|Author Peter Buckley {{attempted}} to evaluate Younger Than Yesterdays contemporary impact more than 30 {{years after the}} fact in his 1999 book, The Rough Guide to Rock: [...] "The album had room for everything from Hugh Masekela's trumpet to droning sitar-like riffs, a brew that may've been <b>too</b> <b>rich</b> for the Byrds' rapidly shrinking teen audience, but was perfectly in tune with a new underground following who disdained hit singles but were coming to regard albums as major artistic statements." ...|$|E

500|$|Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online {{reviewed}} the album as [...] "a sophisticated piano collection" [...] that was enjoyable to listen to, though {{he noted that}} the arrangements were [...] "straightforward" [...] rather than ambitious. Jayson Napolitano of Original Sound Version gave a similar review for the album; he felt that it was an amazing album that, while not as technically difficult or different enough from the source material for some listeners, was still very beautiful and well-arranged. Gann of RPGFan, however, felt disappointed by the album, calling the arrangements [...] "soul-less" [...] and full of [...] "needless grandiosity". He concluded that the original pieces were <b>too</b> <b>rich</b> and complex to translate well to solo piano arrangements, which left the works without substance as they did not deviate enough from the source material.|$|E

Killian Fox of The Observer writes that Nas' observations on his ex-wife's [...] "hefty childcare payments" [...] and his 18-year-old daughter [...] "dating unsuitable men" [...] are resonated by his [...] "recollections of his early years as a Queensbridge hustler – {{just the kind of}} unsuitable young man he's warning his daughter about these days". [...] "Reach Out" [...] features Mary J. Blige and incorporates the piano loop from Isaac Hayes' 1970 song [...] "Ike's Mood". Its lyrics address Nas' feeling displaced [...] "when you're too hood to be in the Hollywood circles, you're <b>too</b> <b>rich</b> to be in the hood that birthed you".
