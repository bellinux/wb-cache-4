50|$|One {{recipe for}} kue gapit from the Indonesian {{magazine}} Femina calls for wheat and rice flour, chicken eggs, coconut water, salt, sugar, and cinnamon. The egg is first beaten, then the cinnamon and sugar is mixed in. Once {{it has been}} absorbed by the mixture, the flour and salt is added, and this concoction is mixed further. After adding the coconut water, a <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixture is added to iron molds and grilled between them until cooked. This is repeated {{until the mixture is}} used up. The resulting kue are then stored for later consumption. Generally, however, tapioca is used rather than this mix of flours. The kue can be eaten on its own, or as a side dish.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} new mouth rinse containing sea salt, xylitol, and lysozyme on biofilm {{formation and}} gingival health {{in a group}} of young adults. Methods. The subjects were divided into two groups of 15 subjects each: control (A) and experimental group (B). The Turesky modification of Quigley-Hein plaque index was used to evaluate plaque scores while {{the presence or absence of}} gingival bleeding was used to determine gingival health. Measurements were done at baseline and at the end of the one-month trial period by one blinded examiner on six representative teeth. Group (A) maintained standardized oral health practices for the duration of the experiment. In addition, group (B) rinsed with a <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> provided sea salt mouth rinse for 30 seconds once in the morning and at night. After the 30 -day trial period, subjects in both groups were reassessed as per baseline. Results. There were no statistically significant differences in the overall reduction from baseline in the mean plaque and gingivitis scores on all surfaces or on individual surfaces. Conclusion. Within the limitations of the study, rinsing with sea salt for thirty days did not affect the gingival and plaque scores {{in a group of}} young adults...|$|E

25|$|Commercial egg substitutes, such as Bob's Red Mill egg {{replacer}} and Ener-G egg replacer, {{are available}} for cooking and baking. The protein in eggs thickens when heated and binds other ingredients together. Flaxseeds will do the same: replace each egg with one <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> flaxseed meal mixed with three <b>tablespoons</b> <b>of</b> water. For pancakes a <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> baking powder can be used instead of eggs. Other ingredients include (to replace one egg): one <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> soy flour and one <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> water; a quarter cup of mashed bananas, mashed prunes or apple sauce; or in batter two <b>tablespoons</b> <b>of</b> white flour, half a <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> vegetable oil, two <b>tablespoons</b> <b>of</b> water, and half a <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> baking powder. Silken (soft) tofu and mashed potato can also be used. Recently, aquafaba has come into use as a popular egg replacement, it can even be whipped up like egg whites.|$|R
50|$|According to a 2007 CNN profile, after Dhallan {{had begun}} his {{residency}} and fathered two children, his wife suffered two miscarriages, which {{caused him to}} be “struck by how little information was available to women who experienced complications during pregnancy....so he resolved to invent a better prenatal diagnostic exam.” Amniocentesis provides 100% accurate results, but has a one-in-200 risk of causing a miscarriage and cannot be carried out until 15 or 18 weeks into the pregnancy; existing non-invasive prenatal screenings, meanwhile, have low accuracy rates. As an alternative to these procedures, Dhallan developed and patented Rapid Analysis <b>of</b> Variations in <b>the</b> Genome, which involves drawing two <b>tablespoons</b> <b>of</b> blood from <b>the</b> expectant mother, isolating fetal DNA cells, and checking them for chromosome 21, the marker for Down syndrome. The method is 99% accurate and can be performed eight weeks into a pregnancy.|$|R

It is commonly seen especially in Black-Sea and South-East regions of Turkey, due to use of mad money as an alternative treatment.

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} shown that <b>the</b> {{consumption}} <b>of</b> carbohydrates increases <b>the</b> glycemic response. <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> our study was to demonstrate <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glycemic index when carbohydrates were independently consumed and when carbohydrates and lipids were consumed jointly. Our findings indicate that the glycemic index was not significantly affected by <b>the</b> consumption <b>of</b> carbohydrates and lipids. Methods: Fifty-nine subjects were screened for a glucose tolerance test where the participants fasted overnight, 10 - 12 hours. Subjects obtained a fasting glucose level test in order to obtain their blood glucose baseline. The glucometer, ReliOn Ultima, model No. 66004 - 0122 - 05, was used to conduct the study. Once the baseline was obtained subjects were then given a bagel that contained 50 grams of carbohydrates. Participants obtained a blood glucose level every 30 minutes after <b>the</b> consumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bagel and were allowed to drink 8 oz. of water. In order to demonstrate <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> lipid consumption in relation to the glycemic index response, subjects were given a <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> cream cheese. <b>The</b> results were compared to fasting serum blood glucose. Results: Participants blood glucose level increased slower when given a <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> cream cheese in conjunction with <b>the</b> 50 grams <b>of</b> carbohydrates. Conclusion: Our study concluded that <b>the</b> consumption <b>of</b> carbohydrates with lipids delayed the glycemic response. However, it does not significantly delay the response.

50|$|Arrowroot thickens {{at a lower}} {{temperature}} than flour or cornstarch, is not {{weakened by}} acidic ingredients, has a more neutral taste, and is not affected by freezing. It does not mix well with dairy, forming a slimy mixture. It is recommended that arrowroot be mixed with a cool liquid before adding to a hot fluid. The mixture should be heated only until the mixture thickens and removed immediately to prevent the mixture from thinning. Overheating tends to break down arrowroot's thickening property. Two teaspoons of arrowroot can be substituted for one <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> cornstarch, or one teaspoon of arrowroot for one <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> wheat flour.|$|R
