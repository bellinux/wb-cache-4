5|$|Benjamin {{became a}} {{specialist}} in commercial law, of which {{there was a great}} deal in New Orleans' busy river port—a center of international commerce and the domestic slave trade. By 1840, the city had become the fourth largest in the United States and among the wealthiest. Many of the best lawyers in the country practiced commercial law there, and Benjamin successfully competed with them. In one case, he successfully represented <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> of a slave against allegations that <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> knew the slave had incurable tuberculosis. Although Benjamin tried some jury cases, he preferred bench trials in commercial cases and was an expert at appeals.|$|E
5|$|NextWorth {{purchases}} used {{electronics and}} resells about 80-85 percent of them, while the remainder {{are sent to}} a network of partners for recycling. Many used iPhones are resold in countries where new ones are more expensive. Sellers can fill out an online form to describe the used products they want to sell, then get a quote through the website. After receiving the quote, sellers have thirty days to ship the product using a pre-paid shipping label provided by NextWorth. The company wipes the device's memory and inspects the item before sending <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> reimbursement in 3-15 days depending on the payment method. If NextWorth appraises a product at a lower condition than <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> expected, they can get an explanation from NextWorth, challenge the quote, or reject it and get the product back.|$|E
5|$|Hire-purchase {{agreements}} are also regulated by this Act. The provisions {{are very similar}} to those for sale of goods agreements, with the section on exclusion clauses identical. Under the 1893 Act, conditional sale agreements (where the buyer takes possession of the goods, but <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> retains the right to repossess them) were treated as hire-purchase agreements, despite being fundamentally sales. With the unification of provisions for hire-purchase and sale of goods agreements, conditional sale {{agreements are}} now treated as sales.|$|E

5|$|Several press {{accounts}} {{reported that}} Timoshenko {{was shot by}} an unlicensed gun that came from Virginia. Previous reports indicated that the gun dealer had previously been indicted for his illegal gun sales, and that all the weapons found in the BMW were illegally obtained. The gun shop in question is now closed, and the dealer has been stripped of his license. Because the gun was used by {{a person with a}} criminal history, and because the NYPD was denied requests to look up <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> of the gun, legislators sought {{to make it easier for}} law enforcement to carry out their investigative duties.|$|E
5|$|An extra in the film, Tyler Nelson, {{violated}} his nondisclosure {{agreement in}} an interview with The Edmond Sun on September 17, 2007, which was then picked up by the mainstream media. It is unknown if he remained in the final cut. At Nelson's request, The Edmond Sun subsequently pulled the story from its website. On October 2, 2007, a Superior Court order was filed finding that Nelson knowingly violated the agreement. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. A number of production photos and sensitive documents pertaining to the film's production budget were also stolen from Spielberg's production office. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department set up a sting operation after being alerted by a webmaster that the thief might try to sell the photos. On October 4, 2007, <b>the</b> <b>seller,</b> 37-year-old Roderick Eric Davis, was arrested. He pleaded guilty to two felony counts and was sentenced to two years and four months in prison.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time that the No. 3 {{locomotive}} was placed into service in 1958, Roger Broggie decided that a fourth locomotive was needed for the DRR. After Walt Disney concurred, Broggie once again began searching for a narrow-gauge steam locomotive to purchase and restore. Broggie eventually found an advertisement in a rail magazine offering a suitable locomotive for sale in New Jersey, and after contacting <b>the</b> <b>seller,</b> Broggie passed on the information to Gerald Best to research the locomotive. Best was able to determine that the locomotive had been built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1925, that it had previously been used to pull tourist trains on the Pine Creek Railroad in New Jersey, and that it had been initially used by the Raritan River Sand Company in New Jersey. After its purchase, the locomotive was delivered to the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop where restoration work began, which included installing a new boiler built by Dixon Boiler Works and adding a new tender built by Fleming Metal Fabricators designed to hold diesel fuel. This locomotive became the DRR's No. 4 locomotive and it went into service on July 25, 1959, at a cost after restoration of more than $57,000. 1959 was also the year in which E tickets arrived, and the attractions deemed to be the best in the park required them, including the DRR.|$|E
5|$|During the 5th and 6th century many Sogdians took up {{residence}} in the Hexi Corridor where they retained autonomy in terms of governance and had a designated official administrator known as a sabao, which suggests their importance to the socioeconomic structure of China. The Sogdian influence on trade in China is also made apparent by a Chinese document which lists taxes paid on caravan trade in the Turpan region and shows that twenty-nine out of the thirty-five commercial transactions involved Sogdian merchants, and in thirteen of those cases both the buyer and <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> were Sogdian. Trade goods brought to China included grapes, alfalfa, and Sassanian silverware, as well as glass containers, Mediterranean coral, brass Buddhist images, Roman wool cloth, and Baltic amber. These were exchanged for Chinese paper, copper, and silk. In the 7th century the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang noted with approval that Sogdian boys were taught {{to read and write}} at the age of five, though their skill was turned to trade, disappointing the scholarly Xuanzang. He also recorded the Sogdians working in other capacities such as farmers, carpetweavers, glassmakers, and woodcarvers.|$|E
5|$|While {{trying to}} escape from East to West Berlin, British agent 009 is fatally wounded and dies after {{reaching}} the residence of the British Ambassador, dressed as a circus clown and carrying a fake Fabergé egg. MI6 immediately suspects Soviet involvement and, after seeing the real egg appear at an auction in London, sends James Bond to investigate and find out the identity of <b>the</b> <b>seller.</b> At the auction, Bond is able to swap the real egg with the fake and engages in a bidding war with exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan, forcing Khan to pay £500,000 for the fake egg. Bond follows Khan back to his palace in Rajasthan, India, where Bond defeats Khan {{in a game of}} backgammon. Bond escapes with his contact Vijay, foiling the attempts of Khan's bodyguard Gobinda to kill the pair. Bond is seduced by one of Khan's associates, Magda, and notices that she has a blue-ringed octopus tattoo. Bond permits Magda to steal the real Fabergé egg fitted with listening and tracking devices by Q, while Gobinda captures and takes Bond to Khan's palace. After Bond escapes from his room he listens in on the bug in the Fabergé egg and discovers that Khan is working with Orlov, a Soviet general, who is seeking to expand Soviet control into West-Central Europe.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>seller</b> {{takes the}} risk that the buyer may default on the contract, depriving <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> of the {{expected}} revenue stream. More important, a seller normally limits its risk by buying offsetting protection from another party— that is, it hedges its exposure. If the original buyer drops out, <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> squares its position by either unwinding the hedge transaction or by selling a new CDS to a third party.

25|$|To {{show this}} relationship, {{suppose that the}} market price of a product is $1.00, and that a $0.50 tax is imposed on the product that, by law, is to be {{collected}} from <b>the</b> <b>seller.</b> If the product has an elastic demand, a greater portion of the tax will be absorbed by <b>the</b> <b>seller.</b> This is because goods with elastic demand cause a large decline in quantity demanded for a small increase in price. Therefore, in order to stabilize sales, <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> absorbs more of the additional tax burden. For example, <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> might drop {{the price of the}} product to $0.70 so that, after adding in the tax, the buyer pays a total of $1.20, or $0.20 more than he did before the $0.50 tax was imposed. In this example, the buyer has paid $0.20 of the $0.50 tax (in the form of a post-tax price) and <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> has paid the remaining $0.30 (in the form of a lower pre-tax price).|$|E

When an option is exercised, the cost to the buyer of the asset acquired is the strike price plus the premium, if any. When the option expiration date passes without the option being exercised, then the option expires and the buyer would forfeit the premium to <b>the</b> <b>seller.</b> In any case, the premium is income to <b>the</b> <b>seller,</b> and normally a capital loss to the buyer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{sequencing}} {{choice of a}} buyer who negotiates with <b>the</b> <b>sellers</b> of two complementary objects with uncertain payoffs. We show that the sequencing matters to the buyer only when equilibrium trade can be inefficient.

If, however, both sellers are strong bargainers, then the buyer begins with the stronger of the two. For either choice, the buyer’s sequencing (weakly) increases the social surplus. Our analysis further reveals that it is sometimes optimal for the buyer to raise her own cost of acquisition to better manage the supplier competition. As such, {{we find that the}} buyer may commit to paying <b>the</b> <b>sellers</b> a minimum price strictly above the marginal cost; and that the buyer may outsource an input even though it can be made in-house.
