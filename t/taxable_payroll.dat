40|$|The Medicare {{system is}} facing a {{financial}} crisis {{brought on by the}} combination of rapidly rising consumption of health care services by beneficiaries and financing based on generation transfers. This paper simulates a transition to prepaid Medicare where each generation puts aside funds for the health care it will demand later in life. By prepaying Medicare we increase the nation's capital stock which in the long run will allow the nation to enjoy greater consumption for both working and retired generations and we achieve immunity from generation size shocks. By transferring the baby boomers and younger generations into a prepaid system we can complete the transition in less than fifty years and achieve an ultimate contribution rate of 1. 26 % of <b>taxable</b> <b>payroll</b> instead of the more than 12 % of <b>taxable</b> <b>payroll</b> that will be required if we remain in the status quo. ...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{consider}} Social Security’s {{treatment of}} postwar Americans under alternative {{tax increases and}} benefit cuts that would help bring the system’s finances into present-value balance. The alternatives include immediate tax increases, eliminating the ceiling on <b>taxable</b> <b>payroll,</b> immediate and sustained benefit cuts, raising the system’s normal retirement age, switching from wage to price indexing in calculating benefits, and limiting the price indexing of benefits. The choices made among these and other alternatives have important consequences for which postwar generations (and which of their members) {{will be forced to}} pay for the system’s long-term financing problems.

40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper we {{analyzed}} {{a method of}} combining traditional tax financed pay-as-you-go Social Security benefits with annuities financed by Personal Retirement Accounts. We showed that such a combination could maintain the level of retirement income projected in current Social Security law while avoiding a future increase in the payroll tax rate. The current paper extends the earlier analysis in four ways: (1) We now specify that the funds deposited in the Personal Retirement Accounts come from allocating 2 percent of the 12. 4 percent payroll tax instead of being additional funds provided from outside the system. (2) We discuss {{the effects of the}} uncertain return on investment based annuities. (3) We provide estimates of the cost of permitting bequests if individuals die either before retirement or during the first twenty years after retirement. (4) We update the statistical basis for our estimates to be consistent with the 2000 Social Security Trustees Report. Our analysis shows that a program of Personal Retirement Accounts funded by allocating 2 percent of the 12. 4 percent payroll tax collections can maintain the retirement income projected in current law while avoiding any increase in the 12. 4 percent payroll tax. The combination of the higher return on the assets in the Personal Retirement Accounts {{and the use of the}} additional corporate profits taxes that result from the increased national saving in Personal Retirement Accounts is sufficient to maintain the solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund even though the tax payments to the fund are reduced from 12. 4 percent of <b>taxable</b> <b>payroll</b> to 10. 4 percent of <b>taxable</b> <b>payroll.</b> Although there is a period of years when the Trust Fund must borrow, it is able to repay this borrowing with interest out of future tax collections. In the long run, the Trust Fund becomes very large, implying that it would be possible to reduce the payroll tax further or to increase retirement incomes above the levels projected in current law. ...|$|E
40|$|The Trustees of the Social Security {{system have}} just issued the 2007 report. The report {{includes}} projec­tions {{for the system}} over the next 75 years, prepared by Social Security’s Office of the Actuary. The bot­tom {{line is that the}} long-run outlook has remained virtually unchanged for the last thirteen years — the system has a 75 -year deficit equal to about 2 percent of <b>taxable</b> <b>payrolls</b> and the trust fund faces exhaustion in the early 2040 s, after which the system will be able to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits. The clear message of the persistent deficits is that the financing shortfall should be eliminated so that people can be assured they receive the income they need in retire­ment. ...|$|R
40|$|As just reiterated in the 2005 Trustees Report, Social Security faces a 75 -year deficit {{equal to}} roughly 2 percent of <b>taxable</b> <b>payrolls.</b> Closing this gap {{requires}} either {{a cut in}} benefits or an increase in taxes. One approach to cutting benefits under consideration by the administration is to change how benefits are indexed. An earlier Just the Facts explored the implications for benefits of moving from “wage indexing” of benefits to “price indexing. ” This Just the Facts describes a proposal for “progressive price indexing. ” The notion is that benefits for low-wage earners would continue to rise in line with wages, while those for maximum earners would rise in line with prices; everyone in between would see some combination of the two. The implication is that replacement rates — benefits {{as a percent of}} pre-retirement earnings — for low earners would remain constant over time, but replacement rates for high earners would decline sharply. The higher the earnings, the sharper would be the decline. price indexing, replacement rates...|$|R

40|$|After {{being held}} up {{for four months}} while {{estimates}} were modified to reflect the expected effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the 2010 Trustees Report for the Social Security system finally emerged in early August. The report contains no surprises, which may explain the relative lack of attention it has received in the press. But {{the fact that the}} future of Social Security has been relatively untouched by the market collapse and ensuing recession is itself newsworthy. Despite reduced revenues and increased benefit claims in the short run, the system continues to face a 75 -year deficit equal to about 2 percent of <b>taxable</b> <b>payroll.</b> This brief puts the current report in perspective and discusses a few interesting wrinkles, such as the outlook for a cost-of-living adjustment in 2011 and the implications of a decline in the Average Wage Index. Unfortunately, for the third year in a row, the Social Security Trustees Report has not been signed by any public trustees. The absence of these independent voices from the valuation process reflects a persistent failure of the political process, but not of the program itself. ...|$|E
40|$|Social Security {{faces an}} {{uncertain}} future. The {{combination of the}} baby boom's coming retirement and increasing life expectancy promises to drive the ratio of workers to retirees down to 2 to 1 some 30 years hence, half {{of what it was}} some thirty years ago. The system can maintain benefits for the next several decades at current tax rates by drawing down the reserves it is now able to accumulate during an era of demographic calm (although this will complicate other governmaent obligations because the return on the reserves finances other parts of the budget. But Social Security cannot make good on its benefits promises in the longer run without significantly higher payroll taxes or without adding to the returns on reserves. The imbalance Social Security faces is just over 2 percent of <b>taxable</b> <b>payroll</b> if it is addressed now. But the cost will mount as time passes. The challenge to Social Security is twofold: to bring the system into long-run financial balance while preserving its popularity and to set a course for the system that is in balance with all the other obligations of government. Support of the elderly and the near-elderly under Social Security and publicly financed health care programs already requires an overall tax rate approaching 10 percent of GDP; it can go only up from there, quite possibly doubling within the next few decades. Government's ability to meet all its other obligations will be in question even more than it is now...|$|E
40|$|As {{currently}} legislated, the U. S. Social Security System {{represents a}} bad deal for postwar Americans. Of every dollar postwar Americans have earned or will earn over their lifetimes, over 5 cents will be lost to the Old Age Survivor Insurance System (OASI) {{in the form of}} payroll taxes paid in excess of benefits received. This lifetime net tax rate can also be understood by comparing the rate of return postwar contributors receive from OASI and the return they can earn on the market. The OASI return [...] 1. 86 percent [...] is less than half the return currently being paid on inflation-indexed long-term government bonds, and the OASI return is much riskier. Of course, Social Security is an insurance as well as a net tax system. But, viewed as an insurance company, the insurance OASI sells (or, rather, forces households to buy) is no bargain. The load charged averages 66 cents per dollar of premium. These findings, developed in an extensive micro simulation study by Caldwell, et al. (1999), assume that current law can be maintained through time. But Social Security faces a staggering long-term funding problem. Meeting the system's promised benefit payments on an ongoing basis requires raising the OASDI 10. 8 tax rate immediately and permanently by two fifths! How bad can Social Security's treatment of postwar Americans get once adjustments are made to save' the system? This paper examines that question using the machinery developed in Caldwell, et al. Specifically, it considers Social Security's treatment of postwar Americans under alternative tax increases and benefit cuts that would help bring the system's finances into present value balance. The alternatives include immediate tax increases, eliminating the ceiling on <b>taxable</b> <b>payroll,</b> immediate and sustained benefit cuts, increasing the system's normal retirement ages beyond those currently legislated, switching from wage to price indexing in calculating benefits, and limiting the price indexation of benefits. The choice among these and other alternatives have important consequences for which postwar generations and which members of those generations will be forced to pay for the system's long-term financing problems. ...|$|E
50|$|Happy Asker {{and five}} other {{shareholders}} were indicted on counts of fraud and tax evasion. The U.S. Attorney's Office alleged Asker and the others {{came up with a}} scheme to under-report <b>taxable</b> income and <b>payroll</b> taxes from $2.1 million in wages from more than 50 Happy's Pizza locations in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and elsewhere. They were charged with conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government, filing false income tax returns, and corrupt endeavor to obstruct IRS laws. The defendants charged with conspiracy faced up {{to five years in prison}} and a $25,000 fine. Those charged with filing false tax returns and obstruction faced to three years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each count. In July 2015, Asker was found guilty on all charges and was sentenced to over four years in prison and ordered to pay $2.5 million in restitution. The other four pleaded guilty. Maher Bashi, the pizza chain’s chief operating officer, was sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to pay $620,297. Two franchisees were given prison sentences and a third received three years probation.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the financial}} impact of Social Security by age cohort under alternative assumptions concerning future financing of Social Security. It examines the Social Security Administration's intermediate IIB and various combinations of optimistic and pessimistic assumptions concerning fertility, mortality, and wage growth. Importantly, it examines {{the implications of}} alternative potential resolutions of the long-term financing deficit and scenarios concerning the planned systematic deviation from pay-as-you-go finance in the retirement and disability funds. The {{results suggest that the}} Social Security retirement program offers vastly different returns to households in different circumstances, and especially to different cohorts. Most important, if Social Security does not maintain the large retirement trust fund surplus currently projected for the next 30 years, alternative scenarios for return to pay-as-you-go finance differ dramatically in the taxes, benefits, transfers, and real rates of return that can be offered to different birth cohorts. The implications of cutting taxes, raising benefits or diverting the surplus to other purposes have dramatic impact on the overall financial status of the system, the time pattern of taxes, benefits and surpluses or deficits, and therefore, the treatment of different age cohorts. Under the intermediate assumptions, the OASDI surplus is projected to grow almost as large as a fraction of GNP as the current ratio of privately held national debt to GNP. For example, if the OASDI surplus is used to raise benefits, and they remained at higher levels thereafter {{during the height of the}} baby-boom generation's retirement, the long-run actuarial deficit will zoom from $ 500 billion to over $ 3 trillion. Correspondingly, if benefits increase, financed by the OASDI surplus over the next 30 years, the expected rate of return on lifetime contributions increases for those currently about 40 years old from 1. 9 % to 2. 7 %, about a 40 % increase. Correspondingly, if the surplus is dissipated and the subsequent long-run deficit is made up with a tax increase on a pay-as-you-go basis at the time of the projected deficit, the rate of return relative to the intermediate assumptions for those persons now being born will fall by about 158, and in this case, the overall system finances would move from a long-run actuarial deficit of slightly under one-half percent of <b>taxable</b> <b>payroll</b> to actuarial balance. Thus, as Social Security is projected to deviate systematically from pay-as-you-go finance, the potential alternative scenarios with respect to accruing the surplus and/or dissipating it in various ways have potentially large intergenerational redistribution effects. ...|$|E
40|$|The Social Security {{trust funds}} are {{projected}} to become exhausted in 2033, according to the 2013 Social Security Trustees Report. If Congress does not act before then, the trust funds {{would be unable to}} pay full Social Security benefits on time. The Social Security Act does not specify what would happen to benefits if the trust funds became insolvent. However, it is clear that full Social Security benefits could not be paid on time because the Antideficiency Act prohibits government spending in excess of available funds. After insolvency, Social Security would continue to receive tax income, from which approximately 77 % of benefits could be paid. Either full benefit checks would be paid on a delayed schedule or reduced benefits would be paid on time. In either case, Social Security beneficiaries and qualifying applicants would remain legally entitled to full benefits and could take legal action to claim the balance of their benefits. Social Security solvency could be restored by cutting Social Security’s spending, increasing its income, or some combination of the two. Over the long range (i. e., over the next 75 years), the Social Security trustees estimate that the trust funds have a shortfall of $ 9. 6 trillion in present value terms, or 2. 72 % of <b>taxable</b> <b>payroll.</b> The sooner Congress acts to fill this gap, the smaller the changes to Social Security need to be, because earlier changes could be spread to a larger number of workers and beneficiaries {{over a longer period of}} time. If Congress waits until the moment of insolvency to act, the trust funds’ annual deficits could be eliminated with benefit cuts of about 23 % in 2033 that will gradually rise to about 27 % by 2087. Congress could also eliminate annual deficits by raising the Social Security payroll tax rate from 12. 40 % to 16. 1 % in 2033, then gradually increasing it to 17. 2 % by 2086. To maintain annual balance after 2086, larger benefit reductions or tax increases would be required. Prompt action to restore Social Security solvency would be advantageous. The combined trust funds began to run annual cash-flow deficits in 2010. Cash-flow deficits require the redemption of government bonds accumulated in earlier years. Cash-flow deficits do not affect Social Security directly. However, if the non-Social Security portion of the federal budget is in deficit, redemption of trust fund bonds puts additional pressure on the overall federal budget. Earlier changes would allow workers and beneficiaries time to adjust their retirement plans. Finally, if Congress were to act today, the benefit cuts or tax increases necessary to restore solvency until 2087 would be smaller than those needed if Congress waited until the trust funds became insolvent to act...|$|E
