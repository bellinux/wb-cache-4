5|$|Following {{the first}} {{decoration}} of the graves in 1866, momentum {{built for the}} erection of a permanent monument to <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> dead at Indian Mound Cemetery. <b>The</b> <b>Confederate</b> Memorial Association engaged in fundraising for construction of the memorial, including sewing circles, bazaars, and fairs. Confederate veterans and others in Hampshire County undertook additional fundraising efforts, including entertainment shows and general solicitation. In addition to raising funds {{for the construction of}} the memorial, <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> Memorial Association also raised money for the widows and children of <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> dead. By October15, 1866, the gross receipts returned to the association's treasury amounted to $1,170.91 USD, of which <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> Memorial Association provided $421.58 USD to <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> widows and orphaned children. Fundraising continued until June 1867.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Confederate</b> Memorial (also {{referred}} to as the First Confederate Memorial) at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney, West Virginia, commemorates residents of Hampshire County who died during the American Civil War while fighting for <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> States of America. It was sponsored by <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> Memorial Association, which formally dedicated the monument on September 26, 1867. The town of Romney has claimed {{that this is the first}} memorial structure erected to memorialize <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> dead in the United States and that the town performed the nation's first public decoration of Confederate graves on June 1, 1866.|$|E
5|$|A small {{community}} in Montgomery County, Virginia near the location where the iron for <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> ironclad was forged {{is now known}} as Merrimac. Some of the iron mined there and used in the plating on <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> ironclad is displayed at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth.

5000|$|A Muslim spy {{discovered}} Ka'b's {{intentions and}} managed to persuade him that <b>the</b> <b>confederates</b> were about to lift the siege and to abandon him to Muhammad. Ka'b therefore asked <b>the</b> <b>confederates</b> for hostages as a pledge of good faith, but the same informant also told <b>the</b> <b>confederates</b> that Ka'b was insincere and would abuse any hostages. When <b>the</b> <b>confederates</b> refused to send hostages, Ka'b refused to open his door for them. Abu Sufyan complained in a list of various difficulties for his army, [...] "The Qurayza tribe have broken their word to us {{and we have not}} received what we wanted from them.... Be off, for I am going!" [...] <b>The</b> <b>confederates</b> then lifted <b>the</b> siege.|$|R

5|$|After {{learning}} of the secession of {{his home state of}} Georgia, Alexander resigned his U.S. Army commission on May 1, 1861, to join <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> Army as a captain of engineers. While organizing and training new recruits to form a Confederate signal service, he was ordered to report to Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard at Manassas Junction, Virginia. He became the chief engineer and signal officer of <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> Army of the Potomac on June 3.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Fort Donelson to Grant's army on February 16, the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, two major water routes in <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> west, became Union {{waterways}} for movement of troops and material. As Grant suspected, the Union capture of the two forts and the rivers flanked <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> forces at Columbus, and soon caused them to withdraw from that city and from western Kentucky.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Confederates</b> under Lt. Gen. James Longstreet {{attempted}} to recapture Suffolk and Norfolk but after besieging the fortified Union forces from April 11, 1863 to May 3, 1863, <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> retired. Brig. Gen. Henry Dwight Terry now commanded the brigade and on April 17, 1863 he sent 6 companies of the 130th New York Infantry out to determine why <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> had ceased firing. When <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> resumed fire, <b>the</b> regiment lost one killed and five wounded. <b>The</b> <b>Confederates</b> broke off <b>the</b> siege on May 3, 1863. The brigade {{took part in}} Maj. Gen.

5|$|An unelected group proclaimed Kentucky's secession {{from the}} Union on November 20, 1861, {{and it was}} annexed by <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> States of America on December 10, 1861. <b>The</b> <b>Confederate</b> {{government}} elected two governors (listed separately), but it never held much control over the state, and the main line of governors was preserved.|$|E

5|$|During the Civil War, a {{group of}} secessionists met at the Russellville to form a Confederate {{government}} for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. While this government never successfully displaced the government in Frankfort, two men were elected governor of <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> government: George W. Johnson, who served from November 20, 1861 to his death on April 8, 1862 at the Battle of Shiloh, and, on Johnson's death, Richard Hawes, who served until <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> surrender on April 9, 1865. <b>The</b> <b>Confederate</b> government disbanded shortly {{after the end of}} the war in 1865.|$|E
50|$|In September 2016, the US House and Senate passed {{legislation}} {{to return the}} ancient bones to a coalition of Columbia Basin tribes for reburial according to their traditions.

25|$|On {{the first}} day of battle <b>the</b> <b>confederated</b> Israelite tribes {{suffered}} heavy losses. On the second day Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah and cut down thousands of <b>the</b> <b>confederated</b> Israelite swordsmen.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Confederates</b> had {{not held}} up the Union Army {{as long as they}} had hoped. Each side {{suffered}} about 700 casualties; however, these were losses the Federals could afford while <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> could not.|$|R
5|$|During the war, White's father John Baker White left Romney {{with his}} wife and {{youngest}} children and traveled to Richmond to work in <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> States Department of the Treasury within the government of the President of <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> States of America. However, White's father died soon after his arrival in Richmond on October 9, 1862.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1861, Johnson tried mightily to assert the {{legitimacy}} of the fledgling government, but to no avail. Its jurisdiction extended only as far as the area controlled by <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> Army. Johnson came woefully short of raising the 46,000 troops requested by <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> Congress in Richmond. Efforts to levy taxes and to compel citizens to turn over their guns to the government were similarly unsuccessful. On January 3, 1862, Johnson requested a sum of $3million from <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> Congress to meet the provisional government's operating expenses. The Congress instead approved a sum of $2million, the expenditure of which required approval of Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin and President Davis.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the leaders}} of Kentucky's Confederate {{government}} had remained in Chattanooga, Tennessee, awaiting Governor Hawes' return. They finally departed on September 18, and caught up with Bragg and Smith in Lexington, Kentucky on October 2. Bragg had been disappointed {{with the number of}} soldiers volunteering for Confederate service in Kentucky; wagon loads of weapons that had been shipped to the Commonwealth to arm the expected enlistees remained unissued. Desiring to enforce <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> Conscription Act to boost recruitment, Bragg decided to install the provisional government in the recently captured state capital of Frankfort. On October 4, 1862, Hawes was inaugurated as governor by <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> legislative council. In the celebratory atmosphere of the inauguration ceremony, however, <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> forces let their guard down, and were ambushed and forced to retreat by Buell's artillery.|$|E
50|$|The Battle of Ware Bottom Church {{was fought}} on May 20, 1864, between Union and <b>Confederate</b> forces during <b>the</b> American Civil War. The Union troops {{were led by}} Benjamin Butler, while <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> were led by P.G.T. Beauregard. <b>The</b> <b>Confederates</b> were victorious, and Butler's forces {{remained}} in their Bermuda Hundred defenses. Following <b>the</b> battle, <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> began digging a critical set of defensive earthworks that {{became known as the}} Howlett Line.|$|R
50|$|Confederate forces began {{driving in}} Stickney’s pickets around 5:00 p.m.. Southern cavalry then advanced, but was driven back. After Union troops fired a few rounds, <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> withdrew in <b>the</b> {{direction}} of Thibodaux. In {{the late afternoon}} of June 21, <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> engaged <b>the</b> Union pickets, and fighting continued {{for more than an}} hour before the Rebels retired. At about 6:30 p.m., <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> reappeared in force, started an artillery duel, and charged the Union lines at 7:00 p.m. An hour later, <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> disengaged and retired toward Thibodaux. The Union held the field. Despite the defeat, Major’s raiders continued on to Brashear City.|$|R
25|$|When Bulnes' troops {{crossed the}} river, {{the battle was}} joined on the entire front line, with the Restorer {{soldiers}} {{out in the open}} and <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> firing upon them from the trenches. From this protected position, <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> thwarted <b>the</b> attack.|$|R
5|$|Monroe {{remained}} {{the commanding officer}} of the 114th Regiment until its disbandment by the Congress of <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> States in April 1862. While serving in <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> States Army, Monroe completed another term {{as a member of}} the Virginia House of Delegates between 1862 and 1865. He participated in the Virginia General Assembly for each legislative session conducted during wartime, returning to his military duties following each session's adjournment.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Five Forks {{occurred}} on April 1, 1865. Five Forks {{is a small}} community in Dinwiddie County, located between Dinwiddie Court House and Petersburg. For this Union victory, Sheridan received reinforcements from the Fifth Corps and a division of cavalry from the Army of the James. Sheridan's plan was to capture <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> infantry that had isolated itself beyond <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> line of defense after pursuing Sheridan at Dinwiddie.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Confederate</b> {{government}} honored Calhoun on a one-cent postage stamp, {{which was}} printed in 1862 but was never officially released.|$|E
50|$|Nelson {{and some}} of his men escaped, but <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> {{captured}} over 4,300 Union troops. Total casualties were 5,353 (206 killed, 844 wounded, and 4,303 captured or missing) on the Union side, 451 (78 killed, 372 wounded, and one missing) for <b>the</b> <b>Confederates.</b> <b>The</b> way north towards Lexington and Frankfort was open.|$|R
25|$|Both {{divisions}} {{were back}} across the Rapidan by 2 a.m., with <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> reoccupying their entrenchments immediately afterwards. Union casualties total 262, while <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> lost sixty. Due to a Union deserter who revealed the Union plans to <b>the</b> <b>Confederates,</b> Butler never made an attack on Richmond, while Lee never requested reinforcements from the city. The I Corps also failed to cross the river, never getting closer than {{a mile and a}} half from Raccoon Ford.|$|R
25|$|Despite some Confederate {{disappointment}} in not destroying, through casualties or capture, {{most of the}} U.S. forces engaged in the Red River Campaign, <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> had a considerable tactical victory. The Federals lost over 8,000 men in the Red River Campaign, including the Camden Expedition, and returned to their starting points {{at the end of}} it. <b>The</b> <b>Confederates</b> lost about 6,500. <b>The</b> <b>Confederates</b> captured 57 artillery pieces, about a thousand wagons, most of them loaded, and 3,500 horses and mules.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Confederate</b> {{government}} of Kentucky was a shadow government {{established for the}} Commonwealth of Kentucky by a self-constituted group of Confederate sympathizers during the American Civil War. The shadow government never replaced the elected government in Frankfort, which had strong Union sympathies. Neither was it able to gain the whole support of Kentucky's citizens; its jurisdiction extended {{only as far as}} Confederate battle lines in the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, the provisional government was recognized by <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> States of America, and Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861. Kentucky was represented by the central star on <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> battle flag.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Confederate</b> {{ordnance}} establishment at Little Rock was reactivated in August, 1862. Looking {{around for}} a suitable person to head this activity, General Hindman turned to <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> Navy and borrowed Lieutenant John W. Dunnington. Lt. Dunnington was {{the commander of the}} gunboat C.S.S. Ponchartrain, which had been brought to Little Rock in hopes of converting it to an ironclad. Dunnington was selected to head the ordnance works at Little Rock, and although he continued to draw his pay from <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> Navy Department, he was placed in charge of all Confederate ordnance activities (which included artillery functions) there with the rank of lieutenant colonel.|$|E
5|$|The Uniforms of <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> States {{military}} forces were the uniforms used by <b>the</b> <b>Confederate</b> Army and Navy during the American Civil War, from 1861 to 1865. The uniform initially varied greatly {{due to a}} variety of reasons, such as location, limitations on the supply of cloth and other materials, State regulations that were different from the standard regulations, and the cost of materials during the war.|$|E
50|$|Both {{divisions}} {{were back}} across the Rapidan by 2 a.m., with <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> reoccupying their entrenchments immediately afterwards.

25|$|Grant's army began marching inland from Bruinsburg. Advancing on the Rodney Road towards Port Gibson, {{they ran}} into Confederate {{outposts}} after midnight and skirmished with them for around three hours. After 3 a.m., the fighting stopped. Union forces advanced on the Rodney Road and a plantation road at dawn. At 5:30a.m., <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> engaged <b>the</b> Union advance and the battle ensued. Federals forced <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> to fall back. <b>The</b> <b>Confederates</b> established new defensive positions at different times during the day {{but they could not}} stop the Union onslaught and left the field in the early evening. This defeat demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>Confederates</b> were unable to defend the Mississippi River line, and the Federals had secured their beachhead.|$|R
50|$|On April 12, 1865, Wilson's men {{marched into}} <b>the</b> former <b>Confederate</b> capital of Montgomery, Alabama, without more than token {{resistance}} from <b>the</b> <b>Confederates.</b>|$|R
