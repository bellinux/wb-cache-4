5|$|Nokian Tyres {{produces}} 23,000 tyres per day at {{a factory}} in Nokia, Finland, and 200,000 tyres a year under the Bridgestone brand name. The original factory was built in 1904, the current one in 1945; it has expanded several times since then. Nokian Tyres has 27 assembly lines at its Finnish plant. The plant uses radio frequency devices to monitor the inventory of materials used to manufacture tyres, such as the 100-metre long strips of rubber <b>tread.</b> Shortages of rubber <b>tread</b> can halt production and so keeping an adequate supply of materials increases efficiency. Despite trade journals discussing this technique, Nokian declines to confirm its production methods.|$|E

50|$|Tank <b>treads</b> - Numerous combat robots {{have used}} <b>treads</b> or belts {{in place of}} wheels {{in an attempt to}} gain {{additional}} traction. <b>Treads</b> are generally heavier and more vulnerable to damage than a wheeled system and offer no particular traction advantage on the types of surfaces common in robot combat. Most uses of <b>treads</b> are for their striking appearance. The Robot Wars competitors 101 and Mortis along with the BattleBots super heavyweight Ronin used <b>treads.</b> Biteforce, the winner of the 2015 Battlebots Competitions, used magnets embedded in its <b>treads</b> in an attempt to gain extra downforce without extra weight.|$|R

5|$|Nokian Tyres {{produces}} tyres {{for passenger}} cars, SUVs, and vans. Nokian branded tyres {{are sold in}} over 60 countries. Nokian Tyres designed the first winter tyres in 1934 and has more winter tyre patents than any other manufacturer. Nokian Tyres {{is known for its}} winter tyres, {{not to be confused with}} all-season tyres. Nokian winter tyres have been described as a favourite of critics and have been well received in winter test results by several publications. Nokian also has designed some winter tyre models with low rolling resistance, offering lower fuel consumption. Nokian was the first company to produce a tyre that allowed for year-round use by having different <b>tread</b> patterns on the lateral and medial aspect of the <b>tread.</b> One pattern is optimised for winter and another pattern is designed as an all-season pattern.|$|E
5|$|Nokian Tyres was {{the first}} tyre {{manufacturer}} {{in the world to}} fully eliminate high-aromatic oils from its production process. Used as plasticising agents in <b>tread</b> production and to facilitate the compounding of rubber, they contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a carcinogen, and have been replaced by low-aromatic oils. In 2006, Nokian Tyres received a commendation in the Finnish round of the European Business Awards for the Environment.|$|E
5|$|Surviving {{interior}} {{features include}} an early 18th-century staircase with carved <b>tread</b> ends decorated with scroll, flower and leaf designs. Each step has three twisted balusters, {{and there is}} a moulded hand rail. The staircase is situated in a hall with an 18th-century ceiling painting of pelicans, trumpets and swags. In the early 21st century it was planned to remove the staircase from the house entirely.|$|E

The Cock, lacking any perch in the stable, {{is forced to}} rest on the ground and in fear of the Horses moving around and stepping on him, advises: “Pray, Gentlefolks! let us stand still! for fear we should <b>tread</b> upon one another!” The speaker then applies this to the contemporary situation, with the Cock representing the Dissenters.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} at least one report of {{deliberate}} vandalism to the structure, but the primary concern relating to visitors to the site {{is the possibility of}} damage caused through <b>tread</b> wear. The site is not heavily trafficked and any wear to the structure since the 1980s would likely be mitigated by the protection from the natural re-establishment of plant growth over its surface. Updates by the North York Moors National Park authority and English Heritage suggest that natural weathering and grazing sheep represent greater erosion risks to the structure than do human agents.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people had}} {{attempted}} to add tracks to moving machines. Over 100 patents had already been issued worldwide, but all failed to work in practical situations. In 1903 Benjamin Holt paid Alvin Lombard US$60,000 {{for the right to}} produce vehicles under Lombard's patent for the Lombard Steam Log Hauler. The center of innovation was in England, and in the same year Holt traveled to England to learn more about ongoing development. During that period, the chief engineer (and managing director) of Richard Hornsby & Sons in Grantham, England, David Roberts, was experimenting with a chain-track. Hornsby's design incorporated a steering clutch that varied the speed of each set of wheels, allowing the operator to turn the tractor by retarding one <b>tread</b> or the other. Roberts of Hornsby & Sons obtained a patent for their design in July 1904.|$|E

40|$|<b>Treading</b> damage by {{cattle in}} wet winters is an {{important}} limitation for all-grass wintering systems in New Zealand. This study evaluated the impact of cattle <b>treading</b> in winter on pasture plants in both hill country and flat dairy pasture over three trials. On hill country pasture, one severe <b>treading</b> treatment in winter resulted in losses in herbage accumulation rate of 9 kg (or 25 %) DM ha- 1 day- 1 on tracks and 6 kg (or 26 %) DM ha- 1 day- 1 on slopes compared to relatively untrodden treatments over a 9 month (Aug 98 to April 99) period. In repeatedly <b>trodden</b> treatments at heavy stocking rates, the loss in herbage accumulation rate averaged 19 kg (or 54 %) DM ha- 1 day- 1 in tracks but found no loss on slopes compared to lightly grazed treatments over the same period. <b>Treading</b> seriously reduced pasture cover and changed species that contributed cover. In flat dairy pastures, the loss of herbage accumulation rate was 29 kg (or 36 %) DM ha- 1 day- 1 in highly damaged areas, and 5 kg (or 7 %) DM ha- 1 day- 1 in low- to medium-damaged areas compared to untrodden areas during the 7 weeks regrowth after <b>treading.</b> This loss in herbage accumulation rate was associated with an initial 66 % reduction in grass tiller density in high-damaged areas. <b>Treading</b> also reduced leaf area index. Post-treading pasture cover was only 43 % in high-damaged areas compared to 80 % in untrodden areas. Compared to other grass species, perennial ryegrass was least affected by <b>treading.</b> Losses in herbage mass and tiller density {{as a result of}} <b>treading</b> recovered, or tended to recover, {{by the end of the}} 7 -week regrowth period. In a second experiment on dairy pasture, <b>treading</b> in winter, again, greatly reduced residual herbage mass and tiller population density. Losses in both residual herbage mass and tiller density recovered by the end of the 7 -week regrowth period. Differences in pasture height before <b>treading</b> did not effect pasture growth but, relative to the tall canopy height, the short canopy height enhanced tillering of ryegrass during the recovery period. The effect of <b>treading</b> on the weight of ryegrass tillers was small. An important aspect of <b>treading</b> was its role in increasing tiller appearance rate of ryegrass and encouraging faster growth of these newly developed tillers. Ryegrass-dominant pastures recovering from <b>treading</b> damage are reliant on the emergence and growth of new tillers...|$|R

5|$|Nokian Tyres {{manufactures}} {{truck and}} bus tyres sold under the Nokian Hakkapeliitta brand. Steer, traction, and trailer tyres are marketed. Nokian Heavy Tyres Ltd is {{a manufacturer of}} special tyres for forestry, industrial machinery, and agriculture. Its products are sold as original equipment as well on the replacement tyre market. Nokian Tyres produces a number of product lines, including the Tractor Industrial 2 and Country King. Nokian Tyres is a world market leader in forestry tyres, which are a key product of the Nokian Heavy Tyres subsidiary. Nokian forestry tyres include the Skidder and Cut-To-Length model lines. The Skidder tyres have a 25 degree bar angle and the Cut-To-Length tyres have a 35 degree bar angle. Bar angle is a tyre <b>tread</b> measurement. Smaller bar angles are associated with higher traction {{at the expense of}} increased mud accumulation.|$|E
5|$|Ideologically, al-Mu'tasim {{followed}} {{the footsteps of}} al-Ma'mun, continuing his predecessor's support for Mu'tazilism, a theological doctrine that attempted to <b>tread</b> a middle way between secular monarchy and the theocratic nature of rulership espoused by the Alids and the various sects of Shi'ism. Mu'tazilis espoused {{the view that the}} Quran was created and hence fell within the authority of a God-guided imām to interpret according to the changing circumstances. While revering Ali, they avoided taking a position on the righteousness of the opposing sides in the conflict between Ali and his opponents. Mu'tazilism was officially adopted by al-Ma'mun in 827, and in 833, shortly before his death, al-Ma'mun made its doctrines compulsory, with the establishment of an inquisition, the miḥna. During his brother's reign, al-Mu'tasim played {{an active role in the}} enforcement of the miḥna in the western provinces, and continued on the same course after his accession: the chief advocate of Mu'tazilism, the head qādī Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad, was perhaps the dominant influence at the caliphal court throughout al-Mu'tasim's reign.|$|E

Some of the connecting elevated bridge ramps have gentle slopes (with some exceptions) to accommodate the disabled. One disadvantage {{of some of the}} ramps is that passengers need to walk a relatively long way up the ramps and then double back to reach the boarding shelters. The floors of the bridge are mostly <b>tread</b> plates although some are made from concrete. One problem with the <b>tread</b> plate is that considerable noise is generated by the movement of passengers across the <b>tread</b> plate surfaces. Another problem {{is that some of the}} <b>tread</b> plate surfaces can become very slippery during the rainy season. There are no sanitary facilities in most of the shelters.|$|E
