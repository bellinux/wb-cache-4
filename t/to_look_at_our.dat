I also appeal for a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness amongst us all...Our beautiful country has been nicknamed `The Warm Heart of Africa' and we have been admired for our warmth and spirit of hardwork. This admiration calls not only for a need for us <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> past and present and draw lessons from it, but there is even a greater need for us to look forward to the future in our endeavours to reconstruct and reconcile if we have to move forward at all.|$|E

Has she been spied on?" [...] Chuck Barsh, an insurance broker whose son is in high school, called the district's actions a [...] "gross invasion" [...] of student privacy, and supported the lawsuit, saying: [...] "These people were able <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> kids in our house". [...] Mike Salmonson, father of an elementary school student, said the matter was [...] "part of … institutional arrogance—a lack of full disclosure and honesty" [...] on the part of district administrators.|$|E
2500|$|... "Every {{generation}} writes its own history," [...] said Kenneth T. Jackson, {{a historian}} of New York City. [...] "It {{could be that}} The Power Broker was a reflection of its time: New York was in trouble and had been in decline for 15 years. Now, for {{a whole host of}} reasons, New York is entering a new time, a time of optimism, growth and revival that hasn't been seen in half a century. And that causes us <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> infrastructure,” said Jackson. “A lot of big projects are on the table again, and it kind of suggests a Moses era without Moses," [...] he added. Politicians are also reconsidering the Moses legacy; in a 2006 speech to the Regional Plan Association on downstate transportation needs, New York governor-elect Eliot Spitzer stated a biography of Moses written today might be called At Least He Got It Built: [...] "That's what we need today. A real commitment to get things done." ...|$|E

5000|$|While {{serving on}} the Governor’s staff, Smith was the Governor’s liaison to the Executive Branch Department Heads as well as New Hampshire’s Executive Council, where Smith {{assisted}} with appointments to Executive Branch Boards, Commissions, and Departments. Smith also served on the Interagency Commission to End Homelessness during {{his time in the}} Governor’s Office although he has said that he considers it a tragedy when [...] "government steps in the role of charitable organizations, of faith-based organizations, of community organizations that do such a great job of helping out people in the community. They've basically outsourced all of the roles that churches and charities used to do to the government and that's a real shame. We need to get back <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> community organizations as a first line of defense and not the government.".|$|R
2500|$|Chibnall was {{inspired}} by ITV's hit show Downton Abbey to cast only top actors. [...] "I said, 'We have to have cast as good as Downton. ...That was absolutely my shameless aim, to go, 'Okay, you have <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> poster and feel that's going to give Downton a run for its money.' [...] " [...] Executive producers Chibnall and Featherstone and producer Richard Stokes held extensive discussions with the casting directors, who then generated lists of potential actors to whom the producers might wish to offer roles or ask to audition. The casting directors also read all the finished scripts, met with location scouts to see photographs of the anticipated location shoots, and had long discussions with various production department heads to gather {{as much information as}} possible so they could choose the right performers to audition. A key rule for the casting team was [...] "no wankers allowed", as Featherstone put it. The production team refused to consider egotistical, obnoxious, vain, temperamental, or arrogant actors for roles, as they felt it made it difficult for both cast and crew to do their best work.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, CSI {{executive}} producer Anthony Zuiker began casting for the then-unnamed Miami based spin-off. First cast was Emily Procter, as Calleigh Duquesne. Regarding {{her decision to}} leave The West Wing and join Miami, Procter stated that [...] "It was like choosing between a boyfriend that {{wants to be with}} you casually or a man that says I love you." [...] She described her character as [...] "a weird girl [...] bright and very nerdy. She wears a lot of boot-cut corduroy pants and turquoise necklaces and looks like a hippie. I just like to pretend I'm Velma in Scooby-Doo." [...] Adam Rodriguez, Rory Cochrane, and Khandi Alexander were cast alongside Procter, completing the supporting ensemble. For the lead, CBS suggested David Caruso. Zuiker, who stated that he had [...] "heard about the NYPD Blue thing," [...] was initially hesitant. Elaborating, Zuiker stated that he [...] "sort of jumped in and said, 'Naw, I don't know about this guy. The show's tough enough to get off the ground and I don't want to walk into any problems." [...] CBS president Les Moonves had announced in January that a Miami spin-off was imminent, yet [...] "It wasn't until we sort of, like, at the eleventh hour, really started <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> options as to who was going to play Horatio, [...] revisited Caruso. And [...] said, 'Yeah, we'll have him come out for dinner, see what he's about.'" [...] Caruso was later cast as Caine. He was the last pilot cast member to be contracted to series.|$|E

60|$|It must be observed, {{that all}} along this river {{they found the}} land, after they came past {{the place where the}} other branch of the river broke off, eastward, was full of {{inhabitants}} on both sides, who frequently came down to the water-side in haste <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> boats; but always when our men called to them, as if they thought our men inquired after their fellows, they pointed up the river, which was as much as to say, they were gone farther that way.|$|E

60|$|It {{was indeed}} a changeful brook; here {{it would make a}} pool, dark and {{brooding}} and still, where we bent <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> mirrored faces; then it grew communicative and gossiped shallowly over a broken pebble bed where there was a diamond dance of sunbeams and no troutling or minnow could glide through without being seen. Sometimes its banks were high and steep, hung with slender ashes and birches; again they were mere, low margins, green with delicate mosses, shelving out of the wood. Once it came to a little precipice and flung itself over undauntedly in an indignation of foam, gathering itself up rather dizzily among the mossy stones below. It was some time before it got over its vexation; it went boiling and muttering along, fighting with the rotten logs that lie across it, and making far more fuss than was necessary over every root that interfered with it. We were getting tired of its ill-humour and talked of leaving it, when it suddenly grew sweet-tempered again, swooped around a curve--and presto, we were in fairyland.|$|E

We rode into it at a trot, which was the most we could get out of our horses, and we stuck in that human mass as if in a moving bog. There was no resistance.
