5|$|MIT {{faculty members}} {{have often been}} {{recruited}} to lead other colleges and universities. Founding faculty member Charles W. Eliot was recruited in 1869 <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> Harvard University, a post he would hold for 40 years, during which he wielded considerable influence on both American higher education and secondary education.

5|$|Somervell {{retired from}} the Army on 30 April 1946 and moved to Ocala, Florida. His wife Anna had died in January 1942, and he had married Mrs. Louise Hampton Wartmann, a former student at Belcourt, in March 1943.

5|$|Both Robert Bingham and Percy Haly died in 1937; with J. C. W. Beckham aging—he {{would die}} in 1940—Chandler moved {{to fill the}} {{leadership}} void in the faction. He soon came {{to believe he was}} destined <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> the United States. In mid-1937, he began advocating for Marvel Mills Logan, Kentucky's junior senator, to be appointed to the Supreme Court, creating a Senate vacancy to which Chandler, as governor, could appoint himself. The death of Justice George Sutherland in January 1938 gave President Franklin D. Roosevelt the opportunity to accommodate Chandler's wishes, but Roosevelt preferred younger justices—Logan was 63—and Kentucky's senior Senator, Alben Barkley, recommended Solicitor General Stanley Forman Reed for the appointment. Roosevelt heeded Barkley's advice and appointed Reed instead of Logan.|$|E

5|$|In 1946 he {{travelled}} the Western Circuit but was recalled by the Lord Chancellor {{to chair}} a committee {{looking at the}} reform of procedure in divorce cases. He continued working as a judge while chairing the daily committee. The committee was appointed on 26 June 1946 and published its first report in July, which reduced the time between decree nisi and decree absolute from 6 months to 6 weeks. The second report was published in November, recommending that County Court judges should be appointed to try cases, and the final report was published in February 1947 recommending {{the establishment of a}} Marriage Welfare Service. The reports were well received by the public and led to Denning being invited in 1949 <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> the National Marriage Guidance Council.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Obama was {{the keynote}} speaker at the Democratic National Convention. After his speech, {{political}} pundits speculated about his future as a possible presidential candidate.

He then defeated John McCain, also a senator, in the general election <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> the United States.|$|E
5|$|John Charles Clegg (better {{known as}} just Charles) became a massive {{influence}} on the national {{as well as the}} local game.

He went on <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> both the city's professional sides (playing a large part in the creation of Sheffield United) and held the same position at Sheffield and Hallamshire FA having overseen the merger of the two rival local FAs. He then moved on to national prominence when he became chairman of the FA in 1890 and president in 1923. He held both positions until his death in 1937.|$|E

5|$|On July 1, 1968, Vernon D. Crawford became {{dean of the}} institute's General College. In March 1969, Harrison {{announced}} that he would take a leave of absence until his resignation was effective; Chancellor George L. Simpson subsequently {{announced that}} Crawford would be the interim president. One notable development during Crawford's term was the advancement of the School of Industrial Management to a college. In 1966, Arthur G. Hansen, then a chairman of the University of Michigan's mechanical engineering department, was named Georgia Tech's Dean of Engineering. On August 1, 1969, Hansen became the institute's next president, a post he held until his resignation on July 1, 1971, <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> his alma mater, Purdue University.|$|E
5|$|Fantasia 2000, {{a sequel}} to the 1940 film {{that had been a}} pet-project of Roy E. Disney's since 1990, was {{released}} on January 1, 2000. Produced in pieces when artists were available between productions, Fantasia 2000 was the first animated feature produced for and released in IMAX format. A standard theatrical release followed in June, but the film's $90 million worldwide box office total against its $90 million production cost resulted in it losing $100 million for the studio. Peter Schneider left his post as president of Walt Disney Feature Animation in 1999 <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> The Walt Disney Studios under Joe Roth. Thomas Schumacher, who had been Schneider's vice president of animation for several years, became the new president of Walt Disney Feature Animation. By this time, competition from other studios had driven animators' incomes to all-time highs, making traditionally animated features even more costly to produce. Schumacher was tasked with cutting costs, and massive layoffs began to cut salaries and bring the studio's staff– which peaked at 2,200 people in 1999– down to approximately 1,200 employees.|$|E
5|$|In Chile, the Socialist Party {{candidate}} Salvador Allende won {{the presidential}} election of 1970, becoming the first democratically elected Marxist <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> a country in the Americas. The CIA targeted Allende for removal and operated to undermine his support domestically, which contributed to a period of unrest culminating in General Augusto Pinochet's coup d'état on 11 September 1973. Pinochet consolidated power as a military dictator, Allende's reforms of the economy were rolled back, and leftist opponents were killed or detained in internment camps under the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA). The Pinochet regime {{would go on to}} be one of the leading participants in Operation Condor, an international campaign of political assassination and state terrorism organized by right-wing military dictatorships in the Southern Cone of South America that was covertly supported by the US government.|$|E

In a typical passage Martí describes Sáenz Peña as [...] "a noble elder", and Quintana as [...] "a vigorous young man, striding forth as if to battle" ...|$|R

5|$|Walker {{accepted}} a re-appointment as {{the superintendent of}} the 1880 Census because a new law, spearheaded by Congressman James A. Garfield, had been passed {{to allow him to}} appoint trained census enumerators free from political influence. Notably, the 1880 Census's results suggested population throughout the Southern states had increased improbably over Walker's 1870 census but an investigation revealed that the latter had been inaccurately enumerated. Walker publicized the discrepancy even as it effectively discredited the accuracy his 1870 work. The tenth Census resulted in the publication of twenty-two volumes, was popularly regarded as the best census of any up to that time, and definitively established Walker's reputation as the preeminent statistician in the nation. The Census was again delayed {{as a result of its}} size and was the subject of praise and criticism on its comprehensiveness and relevance. Walker also used the position as a bully pulpit to advocate for the creation of a permanent Census Bureau to not only ensure that professional statisticians could be trained and retained but that the information could be better popularized and disseminated. Following Garfield's 1880 election, there was wide speculation that he would name Walker to be Secretary of the Interior, but Walker had accepted the offer <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> MIT in the spring of 1881 instead.|$|E
