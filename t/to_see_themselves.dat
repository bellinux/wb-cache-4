5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers to be able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E
5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as when an {{individual}} attempts to present an acceptable image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally (480). This definition is based on Goffman’s idea that individuals see themselves as others view them, so in essence they attempt <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> {{as if they are}} outside looking in (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover the subtle ways humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal.|$|E
5|$|Modern Syria {{was first}} {{established}} in 1920 as the Arab Kingdom of Syria under King Faisal. This state was {{planned to be}} a new Arab kingdom, and not just Syrian, and the state espoused Arab nationalism and pan-Islamic policies. However the British, who had helped establish the state after World War I, made a secret agreement with France and established the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. The area thereby functioned as one of France's colonies, and the newly established state was viewed unfavorably by most Syrians, with many of them regarding it as a vessel of European imperialism. At this stage, some movements tried to establish a Syrian identity, most notably the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, or became advocates of communism and Islamism. The majority of Syrians continued <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as Arabs rather than Syrians.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay men and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, gay men and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} the Danelaw by West Saxon kings had united England in a single kingdom for the first time, {{enabling}} kings from Æthelstan onwards <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as heirs of the Carolingian emperors; the regulation of monasteries by a uniform Benedictine rule was designed to unite the kingdom ideologically and enhance royal prestige. The monks depended on the king {{in a way that}} the local ealdormen did not, so their loyalty could be trusted and they could act as a counterbalance to powerful local families. The Regularis Concordia required that psalms be said for the king and the queen in monasteries several times a day, and specified that royal consent must be obtained for the election of abbots. The reformers aimed to enhance the Christian character of kingship, and one aspect of this was to raise the status of the queen; Edgar's last wife, Ælfthryth, was the first king's consort to regularly witness charters as regina.|$|E
25|$|The major benefit, however, {{is related}} to {{language}} exposure. As pointed out by Tokuhama-Espinosa, language opens the doors to new realms including that of new cultures. TCKs, through prolonged exposure to native language use, can thus also learn <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> {{through the eyes of}} others.|$|E
50|$|American troops also forced local {{citizens}} {{to the camp}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> for <b>themselves</b> the conditions there and to help bury the dead. Many local residents were shocked about the experience and claimed {{no knowledge of the}} activities at the camp.|$|R
50|$|In 2003 {{his novel}} Esra excited {{attention}} when its sale was prohibited shortly after its release. Two persons had a provisional order obtained, because they claimed <b>to</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>themselves</b> reflected in {{characters in the}} book. A German court obliged their request to take the book from circulation on these grounds.|$|R

25|$|In Turkey, the claimed messiah Sabbatai Zevi {{was forced}} to convert to Islam in 1668. Most of his {{followers}} abandoned him, but several thousand converted to Islam as well, while continuing <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as Jews. They {{became known as the}} Dönmeh (a Turkish word for a religious convert). Some Dönmeh remain today, primarily in Turkey.|$|E
25|$|In the 1650s {{after the}} Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Catholics were banned from {{dwelling}} {{within the city}} limits under the vengeful Cromwellian settlement but this law was not strictly enforced. Ultimately, this religious discrimination led to the Old English community abandoning their English roots and coming <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> {{as part of the}} native Irish community.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the reign}} of Ivan the Great (1462–1505), Moscow became a major {{regional}} power, and the annexation of the vast Republic of Novgorod in 1478 laid the foundations for a Russian national state. After the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 the Russian princes started <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as the heirs of the Byzantine Empire. They eventually took on the imperial title of Tsar, and Moscow was described as the Third Rome.|$|E
50|$|Through humor Dickens is able {{to capture}} quintessential aspects of English life {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} that a more sober {{approach}} would miss. Perhaps the popularity of this novel was {{due in part to the}} fact that the readers of the time were able <b>to</b> truly <b>see</b> <b>themselves,</b> and could accept themselves because of Dickens's skillful use of humor.|$|R
5000|$|She and {{her mother}} Birsel {{obtained}} a provisional order to prohibit the sale of Maxim Biller's novel [...] "Esra", which was later confirmed by the German Federal Court, because they claimed <b>to</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>themselves</b> reflected in characters in the book. This verdict caused an outcry in the German public regarding {{the freedom of the}} arts (2007).|$|R
5000|$|Modesty - {{this scale}} {{measures}} a person's beliefs about him/herself in relation <b>to</b> others—high scorers <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as [...] "no better" [...] than anyone else, whereas low scorers feel they deserve special treatment and more respect than others.|$|R
25|$|Between the 1840s and the 1930s, some 900,000 French Canadians {{emigrated to}} the New England region. About half of them {{returned}} home. The generations born in the United States would eventually come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as Franco-Americans. During {{the same period of}} time, numerous French Canadians also emigrated and settled in Eastern and Northern Ontario. The descendants of those Quebec immigrants constitute the bulk of today's Franco-Ontarian community.|$|E
25|$|Luther's Small Catechism proved {{especially}} effective in helping parents teach their children; likewise the Larger Catechism was effective for pastors. Using the German vernacular, they expressed the Apostles' Creed in simpler, more personal, Trinitarian language. He rewrote each article of the Creed {{to express the}} character of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit. Luther's goal was to enable the catechumens <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as a personal object of the work of the three persons of the Trinity, each of which works in the catechumen's life.|$|E
25|$|During deliberations, {{leaders can}} {{intervene}} when debates get heated. They might redirect people's attention and frame {{the debate in}} a different light, redescribe the ideas and data in novel ways so as to enhance understanding and spark new branches of discussion or may revisit ideas in hopes of finding common ground (Roberto, 2005). Deutsch and Coleman (2000) explain that reframing allows conflicting parties <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as being in a collaborative, while producing a positive atmosphere that is conductive to creativity and one that increases the potential solutions available.|$|E

Unwilling {{to live in}} secret with Venus, Beebo returns to New York to recover while Venus and her husband appear happily in public. After a while, Beebo goes to find Paula again, who is thrilled <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her once more. Paula assures her that love can be better and they decide <b>to</b> <b>see</b> for <b>themselves</b> how.|$|R
50|$|His date {{of death}} is unknown, though he was still living in 390 when, {{according}} to the Vita Ambrosii of Paulinus of Milan, two Persian noblemen presented themselves before Theodosius I at Mediolanum but departed the next day for Rome in order <b>to</b> <b>see</b> for <b>themselves</b> Petronius Probus, {{the pride of the}} Roman aristocracy, a legend in his lifetime.|$|R

25|$|The steel {{industry}} completed making its case on February 14. Final arguments were made against the union shop. The issue {{had taken on}} increasing importance to the steel manufacturers over the previous three months. Many of the chief executives of the larger steel companies came <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as the last bulwark against wholesale unionism. Fairless, in particular, felt that if the WSB included a union shop proposal in its recommendations, the ruling would put the government's imprimatur on unionization. The {{steel industry}}, it was felt, was the last defender of capitalism and the free market.|$|E
25|$|Republicans {{strongly}} opposed Obama's 2009 {{economic stimulus package}} and 2010 health care reform bill. The Tea Party movement, formed in early 2009, provided a groundswell of conservative grassroots activism to oppose policies of the Obama administration. With an expected economic recovery being criticized as sluggish, the GOP was expected to make big gains in the 2010 midterm elections. However, establishment Republicans began <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> at odds with Tea Party activists, who sought to run conservative candidates in primary elections to defeat the more moderate establishment-based candidates. Incumbent senators such as Bob Bennett in Utah and Lisa Murkowski in Alaska lost primary contests in their respective states.|$|E
25|$|The {{prospect}} of memory erasure or alteration raises ethical issues. Some of these concern identity, as memory seems {{to play a}} role in how people perceive themselves. For example, if a traumatic memory were erased, a person might still remember related events in their lives, such as their emotional reactions to later experiences. Without the original memory to give them context, these remembered events might prompt the subjects <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as emotional or irrational people. In the United States, the President's Council on Bioethics devoted a chapter in its October 2003 report Beyond Therapy to the issue. The report discourages the use of drugs that blunt the effect of traumatic memories, warning against treating human emotional reactions to life events as a medical issue.|$|E

50|$|In 1886, Wellesley Bailey gave up {{his post}} with the Scottish charity and was {{appointed}} full-time secretary of The Mission to Lepers in India. That same year, Wellesley and Alice set off for a tour of India <b>to</b> <b>see</b> for <b>themselves</b> the vast needs of those with leprosy throughout the whole country. They did not return until the spring of 1887.|$|R
25|$|The 2007 {{documentary}} America the Beautiful explores how {{the fashion}} and beauty industries {{are contributing to}} the problems that individuals feel regarding body image due to their beauty obsession. The film discusses {{a wide range of}} topics like plastic surgery, dieting, eating disorders, the modeling industry along with the fashion industry and much more. Young middle-school aged girls were portrayed {{in the beginning of the}} film and asked if they found themselves beautiful. The girls who are around the ages of 13 had decided that they were not beautiful. In today's society, people are starting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as ugly at an earlier age than ever before. As individuals who identify as ugly increase, the number of body image issues also increase.|$|E
25|$|Her plots are {{fundamentally}} about education; her heroines come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> and their conduct more clearly, and become better, more moral people. While Austen steers {{clear of the}} formal moralizing common in early-19th-century literature, morality—characterized by manners, duty to society and religious seriousness—is a central theme of her works. Throughout her novels, serious reading is associated with intellectual and moral development. The {{extent to which the}} novels reflect feminist themes has been extensively debated by scholars; most critics agree that the novels highlight how some female characters take charge of their own worlds, while others are confined, physically and spiritually. Almost all Austen's works explore the precarious economic situation in which women of the late-18th and early-19th centuries found themselves.|$|E
25|$|September 21, 2005: Flight 292 {{en route}} from Burbank, California, to New York City {{performed}} an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport (pictured on the right) following {{a failure of the}} front landing gear during retraction when it turned 90 degrees. The plane landed after holding for about three hours to burn fuel and lighten the aircraft. The aircraft came to a stop without incident on runway 25L, the second-longest runway at LAX. The only apparent damage to the plane upon landing was the destruction of the front wheels, which were ground down to almost semicircles, and the tires; the front landing strut held. The passengers were unable <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> landing despite the DirecTV service in each seat, as it was turned off before landing.|$|E

That some do so in the name of Judaism itself makes the nature of their assault all the more grotesque." ...|$|R
5000|$|Foley and Lennon {{explored}} {{the idea that}} people are attracted to regions and sites where [...] "inhuman acts" [...] have occurred.
