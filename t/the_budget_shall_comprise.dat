40|$|The {{object of}} this study is to clarify the {{decision-making}} process which takes place every year at the preparation of <b>the</b> central government <b>budget.</b> <b>The</b> question in what way <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> decisions are taken has been viewed from different angles. Jurists have tackled the problem from the constitutional and administrative angle. Economists have considered it in terms of optimal allocation of factors of production and in relation to the circular flow of public finance. A few political scientists with strong economic leanings have, in looking at the conduct of the government, taken as their starting-point the hypothesis that it is intent on maximizing the number of votes given to the ruling party. It appears that each of these approaches casts light upon a single aspect of the conduct of the government only. Our study is an attempt to deal with the problem from the public administration point of view. In discussing the legal, economic, and political sides to <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> preparation, we <b>shall</b> also specifically dwell upon the ways and the places in which the decisions on <b>the</b> central government <b>budget</b> are taken. We shall endeavour to give a survey of the decision-making; ours will be an attempt to integrate fragmentary examinations [...] . ...|$|R
