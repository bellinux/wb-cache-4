25|$|On 17 October 2011, Purdue University Professor Louis Rene Beres {{made the}} case against freeing Shalit in an op-ed column in the Jerusalem Post: No modern {{government}} has {{the legal right to}} free terrorists in exchange for its own kidnapped citizens, military or civilian. Under long-standing international law, every state has a primary obligation to protect its citizens. Yet it appears <b>that</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> Israel Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu will exchange Palestinian terrorists for kidnapped IDF soldier Gilad Schalit. Any such exchange, however humane to Schalit and his family, would imperil thousands of other Israelis.|$|E

2500|$|The machine {{releases}} all of {{the lawn}} gnomes and they erupt onto the beach. The beach goers flee in panic of [...] "gnomeageddon" [...] and the beach is destroyed. Candace does not realize this as {{she is trying to}} convince her mother not to come in and ruin her good time, so when she tries to justify the beach's existence, she finds nothing but their normal backyard. Candace is depressed, but the boys find the day to be a successful one. Candace is helped inside by Isabella and Linda. At the end, the DJ from the beginning congratulates Phineas and Ferb and also says <b>that</b> <b>tomorrow</b> will be hot and sunny too, but then Ferb adds [...] "with a slight chance of scattered lawn gnomes", to which Phineas (and probably a lot of viewers) laughs.

2500|$|Political infighting with career Ford executives, notably Lee Iacocca, {{led to his}} {{dismissal}} from Ford on September 11, 1969. Reportedly, Henry Ford II sent Ford's {{vice president}} for public relations, Ted Mecke, to Knudsen's home the previous night to inform {{him that he would}} be fired, telling Knudsen that [...] "Henry sent me here to tell you <b>that</b> <b>tomorrow</b> will be a rough day at work."

[...] Noted for his laconic replies to difficult questions, Mr. Ford told the media [...] "Things just didn't work out", but later reports indicated many career Ford executives allied themselves with Iacocca and were working against Knudsen. His dismissal led to a widely circulated witticism in Ford circles as the hallmark phrase of Henry Ford I, [...] "History is bunk", was turned around to [...] "Bunkie is history".|$|E
