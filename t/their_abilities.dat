5|$|Australia {{defeated}} South Africa 4–0 {{and senior}} {{players such as}} Bill O'Reilly were pointed in their comments about the enjoyment of playing under Richardson's captaincy. A group of players who were openly hostile toward Bradman formed during the tour. For some, the prospect of playing under Bradman was daunting, as was the knowledge that he would additionally be sitting in judgement of <b>their</b> <b>abilities</b> {{in his role as}} a selector.|$|E
5|$|Battles are turn-based {{and take}} place on grid-based maps. Victory is {{achieved}} when an enemy base is captured or all enemies are defeated. Each character holds four weapons and four items, and each has an assigned character class, which affects their movement range, damage and what weapons can be used. Mounted units also {{have the option to}} dismount, which changes <b>their</b> <b>abilities</b> and stats while reducing movement range.|$|E
5|$|El Naseri, or Al-Nasir Muhammad, Sultan of Egypt (1290–1342) {{imported}} {{and bred}} numerous Arabians in Egypt. A stud farm record {{was made of}} his purchases describing many of the horses as well as <b>their</b> <b>abilities,</b> and was deposited in his library, becoming a source for later study. Through the Ottomans, Arabian horses were often sold, traded, or given as diplomatic gifts to Europeans and, later, to Americans.|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a research about communication skill of secondary biology student in Arthropode classification using phenetic method. Data {{were obtained from}} written report and oral presentation. There were five indicators used to analyze communication skill in oral presentation, which included <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to express opinion themselves and hearing the opinion from other, <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to master the concept to be presented, <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to communicate of results systematically and clearly, <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to question, and <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to answer. Five indicators used in written report were <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to choose informative character to build fenogram, <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to undergo step by step, resulted phenogram, <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to interpret the results, and <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to make a report. Results showed that communication skill in oral were good enough (63. 75 %), but low (56. 25 %) in written. Based on interview, however, students felt comfortable when teacher used the phenetic method to understand classification of Arthropode. This method has markedly stimulated the students to study actively in the classroom. Keywords: arthropode, communication skill, classification, phenetic method...|$|R

5|$|Fischer heavily disparaged chess {{as it was}} {{currently}} being played (at the highest levels). As a result, on June 19, 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fischer announced and advocated a variant of chess called Fischerandom Chess (later known as Chess960). The goal of Fischerandom Chess was {{to ensure that a}} game between two players is a contest between their understandings of chess, rather than <b>their</b> <b>abilities</b> to memorize opening lines or prepare opening strategies.|$|E

Shaken by the massacre of his troops, Kurt improves the training regimen for his next batch of SPARTAN-III recruits, but they too are all killed in action so Kurt, {{in an effort to}} reduce casualties, institutes illegal biological modifications on the third company of SPARTANs. While conducting a training exercise near Zone 67, UNSC personnel find themselves under attack by alien robotic drones.|$|E

Their small size and gentle nature made them the historically preferred mount for children and women, but they were also used as working animals due to <b>their</b> <b>abilities</b> in the field. Today, they are used in endurance riding, as well as continuing their traditional work assisting humans with hunting wild game and herding cattle.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of starling predators are avian. The typical response of starling groups {{is to take}} flight, with a common sight being undulating flocks of starling flying high in quick and agile patterns. <b>Their</b> <b>abilities</b> in flight are seldom matched by birds of prey. Adult common starlings are hunted by hawks such as the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), and falcons including the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo) and common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). Slower raptors like black and red kites (Milvus migrans & milvus), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and Australasian harrier (Circus approximans) tend to take the more easily caught fledglings or juveniles. While perched in groups by night, they can be vulnerable to owls, including the little owl (Athene noctua), long-eared owl (Asio otus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), barn owl (Tyto alba), tawny owl (Strix aluco) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo).|$|E
5|$|A {{terrorist}} group manages to abduct Nao and Kumagami, one of Shunsuke's closest friends and aides, and holds them hostage {{in exchange for}} Yuu, who attempts to rescue them. However, the operation does not go as planned, which results in Kumagami's death and Yuu being gravely injured. After Yuu recovers, he resolves to protect all of the ability users around the world by stealing <b>their</b> <b>abilities</b> per Nao's suggestion. As Yuu travels the world stealing abilities, the more powers he takes on soon takes its toll on him as he starts losing his memories and sense of self. However, he still manages to steal everyone's abilities throughout the world before collapsing. Shunsuke rescues Yuu, bringing him back to Japan among friends and family. Yuu is left with no past memories, but Nao tells him she is his girlfriend. Yuu and his friends {{look forward to the}} memories they will make from now on as Yuu continues to recover from his ordeal.|$|E

5|$|Alive or Just Breathing is {{the second}} studio album by American metalcore band Killswitch Engage. It was {{released}} on May 21, 2002, through Roadrunner Records. Alive or Just Breathing was Killswitch Engage's first album on Roadrunner and was recorded from October 2001 to February 2002. Produced by drummer and guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz, this was the band's first album on a major label, which prompted them to write and record the album {{to the best of}} <b>their</b> <b>abilities.</b> Alive or Just Breathing has been viewed as a landmark album in the metalcore genre and was well praised upon its release by fans and critics.

5|$|In {{addition}} to independent movements, the party can create formations, with specific formations triggering different status buffs such as regenerating HP or AP. New formations are acquired {{through the course}} of the game, and are specific to characters. Following each battle, characters gain both experience points and ability points; the former raises their experience level and general statistics, while the latter are used as currency to unlock more or upgrade existing abilities. Each character's equipment can be enhanced through the combined effects of assigning types of equipment and items or accessories to a particular character, strengthening <b>their</b> <b>abilities.</b> In {{addition to}} standard battles, characters have access to mechs with their own move sets and abilities, with basic mechanics shared with normal battles.|$|E

30|$|Non-entrepreneurs exhibit {{overconfidence}} up to {{the limit}} on which the information is considered insufficient; therefore, the task in hand becomes uncertain.
