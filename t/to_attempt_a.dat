5|$|Because Tech {{committed}} a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty following the touchdown, NC State {{was able to}} acquire good field position during the kickoff return, starting their drive at their 44-yard line. On the second play of the drive, Erik Kramer completed an 18-yard pass to Nasrallah Worthen, driving State into the Tech side of the field.

NC State was unable to pick up another first down and sent in Mike Cofer <b>to</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>a</b> 33-yard kick, which was successfully completed. The field goal regained NC State a 2422 lead.|$|E

Despite the good field position, Tech was unable to gain a first down. Tech kicker Shayne Graham was sent into the game, seemingly <b>to</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>a</b> 51-yard field goal. Instead of kicking the ball, Graham {{attempted to}} run the ball for a first down. Graham fumbled short of the first down, and Florida State took over on offense with 9:43 remaining in the first half.|$|E

Skinner was sacked by a Tech defender, and kicker Sam Swank was sent into the game <b>to</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>a</b> 45-yard field goal. Swank's kick was no good, and with 7:26 remaining in the second quarter, Georgia Tech still had a 30 lead.|$|E
