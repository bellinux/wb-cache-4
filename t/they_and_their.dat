5|$|Additional subfamilies {{have been}} named for more fragmentary genera, {{including}} Aublysodontinae and Deinodontinae. However, the genera Aublysodon and Deinodon are usually considered nomina dubia, so <b>they</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> eponymous subfamilies are usually excluded from taxonomies of tyrannosaurids. An additional tyrannosaurid, Raptorex, was initially described as a more primitive tyrannosauroid, but likely represents a juvenile tyrannosaurine similar to Tarbosaurus. However, {{as it is known}} only from a juvenile specimen, it is also currently considered a nomen dubium.|$|E
5|$|Age, {{cognitive}} growth, {{and continued}} social experience advance {{the development and}} complexity of the internal working model. Attachment-related behaviours lose some characteristics typical of the infant-toddler period and take on age-related tendencies. The preschool period involves the use of negotiation and bargaining. For example, four-year-olds are not distressed by separation if <b>they</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> caregiver have already negotiated a shared plan for the separation and reunion.|$|E
5|$|An {{epilogue}} flashback scene soon {{reveals that}} Kelso {{had known about}} the stolen morphine and Sheldon's involvement, after <b>they</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> other fellow Marines found the surplus supply on their ship home. However, Kelso refused {{to be involved in}} Sheldon's scheme to sell the drugs along with the other Marines, telling them all that they will lose his respect for them as Marines if they go through with the drug profiting, setting in motion the events of the game.|$|E

5|$|Phát and Thảo were {{stripped}} of their ranks, but nothing was initially done as far as prosecuting or sentencing them for their involvement in the coup. The new junta decided to ignore Khiêm’s actions and he remained in Washington as the ambassador, with no further action taken. Phát and Thảo stayed in hiding in Catholic villages. They offered to surrender and support the government if <b>they</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> officers were granted amnesty.|$|E

However, this failed to materialize, and in May 1965, a military tribunal loyal to Kỳ sentenced both to death in absentia.|$|E
5|$|Typical {{metalloids}} have {{a metallic}} appearance, {{but they are}} brittle and only fair conductors of electricity. Chemically, they behave mostly as nonmetals. They can form alloys with metals. Most of their other {{physical and chemical properties}} are intermediate in nature. Metalloids are usually too brittle to have any structural uses. <b>They</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> compounds are used in alloys, biological agents, catalysts, flame retardants, glasses, optical storage and optoelectronics, pyrotechnics, semiconductors, and electronics.|$|E
5|$|By the 3rd century, Romanised Illyrians and Thracians, mostly primipilares {{and their}} descendants, came to {{dominate}} the army's senior officer echelons. Finally, the Danubian officer-class seized {{control of the state}} itself. In 268, the emperor Gallienus (ruled 260–68) was overthrown by a coup d'état organised by a clique of Danubian senior officers, including his successors Claudius II Gothicus and Aurelian (270–75). <b>They</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> successors Probus (276–82) and Diocletian (ruled 284–305) and his colleagues in the Tetrarchy formed a sort of self-perpetuating military junta of Danubian officers who were born in the same provinces (several in the same city, Sirmium, a major legionary base in Moesia Superior) and/or had served in the same regiments.|$|E

5|$|Gautham and Sameera go to London, where <b>they</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> driver Gulaab Singh {{escape from}} a murder attempt; Gautham's manager, Michael, is killed. The Rubik's Cube, when solved a certain way, reveals a safe-deposit-box number in which Gautham finds a {{preserved}} rice sample. After escaping another murder attempt {{in a parking}} lot, he eludes {{the police and the}} two men with Sameera and Singh's help. One of the men—a fan—seeks revenge for his father (one of the other murderers, according to the aged taxi driver), who was killed by Gautham in Belfast when he performed there. Gautham learns that the aged taxi driver he met previously is a businessman and the murderer; the person hit by the businessman's car in Gautham's presence was the actual, innocent taxi driver.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Victoria's brother, Ernest Louis, {{died and}} soon {{afterwards}} her widowed sister-in-law, nephew, granddaughter {{and two of}} her great-grandchildren all died in an air crash at Ostend. Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark, had married Victoria's nephew (Ernest Louis's son), George Donatus of Hesse. <b>They</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> two young sons, Louis and Alexander, were all killed. Cecilie was pregnant {{at the time and}} the stillborn child was found among the wreckage. Cecilie's youngest child, Johanna, who was not on the plane, was adopted by her uncle Prince Louis of Hesse and by Rhine but the little girl only survived her parents and older brothers by eighteen months, dying in 1939 of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|Iori is {{a violent}} and sadistic person {{who suffers from}} trauma because of his clan's past. In ancient times, the Yagami clan {{was known as the}} Yasakani. With the help of the Yata and Kusanagi clans, they sealed the demon Orochi. As time passed, the Yasakani, tired of living {{in the shadow of the}} Kusanagi, made a blood pact with Orochi. This gave them greater powers, but in return, <b>they</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> {{descendants}} were forever cursed. They renamed their clan the Yagami and set out to destroy the Kusanagi with their new powers. In response, the Kusanagi declared war on the Yagami, which led to many clan members on both sides being killed.|$|E

5|$|Modern Britons are descended {{mainly from}} the varied ethnic groups that settled in the British Isles in and before the 11th century: Prehistoric, Brittonic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Normans. The {{progressive}} political unification of the British Isles facilitated migration, cultural and linguistic exchange, and intermarriage between the peoples of England, Scotland and Wales during the late Middle Ages, early modern period and beyond. Since 1922 and earlier, there has been immigration to the United Kingdom by people from {{what is now the}} Republic of Ireland, the Commonwealth, mainland Europe and elsewhere; <b>they</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> descendants are mostly British citizens, with some assuming a British, dual or hyphenated identity.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 May Prvanović's revenue sergeants {{assembled}} and Sergeant Budivoj Grbić accepted the task and led Princip and Grabež by foot to Isaković's Island, a small island {{in the middle of}} the Drina River that separated Serbia from Bosnia. <b>They</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> weapons reached the island on 31 May. Grbić passed the terrorists and their weapons to the agents of the Serbian Narodna Odbrana for transport into Austro-Hungarian territory and from safe-house to safe-house. Princip and Grabež crossed into Austria-Hungary on the evening of 1 June. Princip and Grabež and the weapons were passed from agent to agent until on 3 June they arrived in Tuzla. They left the weapons in the hands of the Narodna Odbrana agent Miško Jovanović and rejoined Čabrinović.|$|E
5|$|Phineas and his stepbrother Ferb {{learn from}} their friend Baljeet that a tool they need for their latest project {{has yet to be}} invented. <b>They</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> friend Isabella borrow the time machine on display at the local museum to travel twenty years into the future. Once they arrive, Isabella stays behind with the time machine while the boys enter their sister Candace's backyard, where her sons Fred and Xavier are sitting under a tree doing nothing. The boys {{convince}} their future nephews to be active and in return are given the tool they need. As they leave, Candace spots them and it brings back upsetting memories of never being able to bust the boys. She takes her mother Linda to the museum where the boys leave, right before Linda can see them.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} August, Simon & Schuster published Faithful, a {{book which}} collected e-mails about the Red Sox between American writers and Red Sox fans Stephen King and Stewart O'Nan during the 2004 season. In March 2005, Houghton Mifflin Company published Reversing the Curse, {{a book by}} Shaughnessy, author of the bestselling The Curse of the Bambino, chronicling the 2004 Red Sox season. ESPN's Bill Simmons published Now I Can Die In Peace, a collection of his columns with updated annotations and notes, including columns {{for each of the}} last four games of the ALCS and each World Series game – with Game 4 being a running diary. The Farrelly Brothers altered the ending of their 2005 film Fever Pitch – which includes appearances by Damon, Nixon and Varitek – to coincide with the actual end of the series. <b>They</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> crew, plus stars Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon, flew to St. Louis and Barrymore and Fallon attended Game 4 in character, complete with the two of them running onto the field at Busch Stadium and kissing once the final out was made.|$|E
5|$|In July 1950, {{there were}} about 20,000 Hispanics in the armed forces. Over the next three years, nearly 148,000 Hispanic-Americans volunteered for or were drafted into {{military}} service. As in other conflicts, Hispanics fought {{as members of the}} Armed Forces, most Hispanic-Americans served in the Army and Marine Corps. On September 15, 1950, the 1st Marine Division, under the command of Major General Oliver P. Smith, led the first major United Nations force strike in North Korean-occupied territory, with a surprise amphibious assault at Inchon. On November 27, 1950, elements of the Chinese Communist People's Liberation Army struck Marine positions in force. The Chinese and Marine Corps forces engaged in some of the fiercest fighting of the Korean War. Hispanics in the 1st Marine Division distinguished themselves in combat even though <b>they,</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> comrades, lacked warm clothing during the cold and harsh winters. Five Marines of Hispanic descent were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in the Korean War. All five were members of the 1st Marine Division: PFC Fernando Luis Garcia, PFC Edward Gomez, Staff Sergeant Ambrosio Guillen, First Lieutenant Baldomero Lopez and PFC Eugene Arnold Obregon. Two of the four Marine Navy Cross recipients were also members of the 1st Marine Division.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} Ubon Air Base in the Ubon Ratchathani Province of eastern Thailand on 1June 1962 and flew its first operational patrol four days later. Facilities at Ubon were initially spartan, and the pilots and ground crew lived in tents. Construction of permanent accommodation began {{under the supervision}} of No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron in September 1962, however, and facilities were later further improved. Despite Malaysia's policy of neutrality in regards the conflict in Southeast Asia, No.79 Squadron operated as a detachment of the RAAF force (No.78 Wing) based at Butterworth throughout its time in Thailand. Aircraft and personnel were regularly transferred between Butterworth and Ubon, and most pilots' nominally six-month-long tours of duty in Thailand were broken into several shorter periods during which <b>they</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> aircraft were illegally rotated between the two bases. In March 1963 the Defence Committee, which was the highest decision-making body of the Department of Defence, recommended to Cabinet that No.79 Squadron be withdrawn from Thailand {{on the grounds that the}} British and New Zealand contingents had left the country. The Cabinet's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee decided against this on 28March as it was believed that maintaining the squadron at Ubon helped maintain good relationships with Thailand and the United States. The Thai Government was discreetly asked if it would prefer a different form of assistance, however.|$|E
