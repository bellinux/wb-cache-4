5|$|Four days later, while {{searching for}} a U-boat {{in the area of}} Conigbeg Rock, the {{destroyer}} received word that the Conigbeg Lightship had rescued survivors from a fishing vessel. Wainwright rendezvoused with the craft <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>the</b> four seamen of the smack Our Bairns. They revealed that the U-boat—which turned out to be —was of the latest type Germany had in action. The destroyer relieved the lighthouse vessel of the four fishermen and continued the search until dusk, when she headed back to Queenstown to land the rescued men.|$|E

Weinsider appears to be especially distraught after hearing the news. That night, Laura has a terrifying dream in which a demon-like figure snatches the baby from her womb. When she wakes up, the couple discover that Laura has seemingly miscarried. Laura's brother, local deputy sheriff Arky Stevens, reports her story to the X-Files section at the FBI.

5|$|Jennings {{returned}} to the U.S. {{at the end of}} 1974 to become Washington correspondent and news anchor for ABC's new morning program AM America, a predecessor to Good Morning America. ABC was hoping that the show, in which it had invested $8 million, would challenge NBC's highly popular Today. AM America debuted on January 6, 1975, with Jennings delivering regular newscasts from Washington. The show never gained ground against Today, and was canceled in just ten months. In November 1975, Jennings moved abroad, this time as ABC's chief foreign correspondent. He continued to cover the Middle East, and in 1978 he was the first Canadian or American reporter <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>the</b> Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran, then in exile in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Rome {{to cover}} the Turkish War of Independence for the International News Service, Bryant lived with Bullitt in a villa in Constantinople in early 1923. While Bullitt worked on a novel, It's Not Done, {{published}} in 1926 and dedicated to Bryant, she covered events related {{to the rise of}} Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the first president of the Republic of Turkey. From her base in Turkey, she ventured to Palermo <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>the</b> deposed king of Greece, Constantine I, and to Athens to interview his son, George II. Shortly thereafter, Bryant suspended her journalistic career to focus on family matters.|$|E

5|$|Some bootleggers noticed rock {{fans that}} {{had grown up with}} the music in the 1960s wanted rare or {{unreleased}} recordings of bands that had split up and looked unlikely to reform. For instance, the release of Golden Eggs, a bootleg of outtakes by The Yardbirds had proven to be so popular that the bootlegger had managed <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>the</b> band's Keith Relf for the sequel, More Golden Eggs. Archive live performances became popular; a 1970 release of Dylan's set with the Hawks (later to become the Band) at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in 1966 (incorrectly assumed to be the Royal Albert Hall for years) was critically and commercially successful owing to the good sound quality and the concert's historical importance.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, {{two members}} of the Security Committee of the Czech Parliament visited Uherský Brod and talked to {{multiple}} witnesses. The MPs issued a report condemning handling of the situation by the police. Among other issues, the MPs criticized that policemen parked their cars and put bullet proof vests on within the shooting range of the attacker, initially failed to get information from the witnesses and only later during the intervention attempted to contact them, didn't cover the back exit and thus potentially allowed the perpetrator {{to get out of the}} object and jeopardize other people. The police even let a helicopter land within the shooting range of the attacker. According to MPs, the police left much to be desired in regards of communication and most importantly, they wrongly decided to believe the perpetrator's claim of having hostage even though the witnesses could have readily confirmed that everyone inside was most likely dead. The policemen didn't seal the vicinity of the attack until 1pm and used civilian phones in communication with superior officers instead of using either their own phones or radio transmitters. Minister of Interior Chovanec commented that the MPs failed <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>the</b> policemen and thus didn't get all the relevant information.|$|E

25|$|The Bermuda Supreme Court convened at 9 p.m. on February 18 <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>the</b> slaves.

They later gained access to the village, where they found one dead man and a number of injured people and received reports of other deaths and of people being taken away by the Serbian security forces.

25|$|In {{addition}} to refusing to grant visas, Bahraini authorities had detained several journalists. On 31 March 2011, four CNN journalists were detained {{on a charge}} of not having proper documents. The journalists stated they did possess the correct documents, however, they were not able to conduct the interviews they had scheduled because of their source's fear of being arrested. When the same journalists attempted <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>the</b> president of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, Rajab, at his home, six military vehicles arrived and 20 masked men surrounded the CNN team and Rajab and deleted all of the photos. Another CNN reporter, Mohammed Jamjoom, was expelled from Bahrain on 16 March, the same day he arrived. He said he was asked to leave without any explanation and a government official escorted him to the airport. CNN produced a documentary about the use of Internet technology and social media in the Arab Spring, including a 13-minute segment on the Bahraini uprising that reported repressive conduct by the government; CNN aired the documentary only once in the United States and not at all on CNN International.|$|E
25|$|Rundstedt {{returned}} to Island Farm to await developments. Otto John, a German lawyer {{who had been}} active in the German resistance, arrived in October <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>the</b> prisoners and make recommendations on possible future war crimes prosecutions. John and Rundstedt got on well, and in November John arranged for Hans Gerd von Rundstedt, who was suffering from the early stages of throat cancer, to be released and sent home. In April 1947 the Allied War Crimes Investigation Group operating in Germany recommended that Rundstedt should not face prosecution. The U.S. government, however, did not accept this recommendation and insisted that Rundstedt, Manstein, Brauchitsch and General Rudolf Strauss (an Army commander on the Russian front in 1941) should stand trial. All four were in British custody. In August Telford Taylor, the U.S. Chief Counsel for War Crimes, formally advised the British Attorney-General, Hartley Shawcross, of his intentions. The grounds for the prosecution would be the Commissar Order of 1941, the Commando Order of 1942, the murder of Soviet prisoners-of-war, the conscription and deportation of civilians in occupied countries as forced labour, and the responsibility of the named officers for the invasions of Poland, France, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union and other countries.|$|E

25|$|In writing Shiji, Sima {{initiated}} a new writing style by presenting {{history in a}} series of biographies. His work extends over 130 chapters — not in historical sequence, but divided into particular subjects, including annals, chronicles, and treatises — on music, ceremonies, calendars, religion, economics, and extended biographies. Sima's work influenced the writing style of other histories outside of China as well, such as the Goryeo (Korean) history the Samguk Sagi. Sima adopted a new method in sorting out the historical data and a new approach to writing historical records. At the beginning of the Shiji, Sima declared himself a follower of Confucius’s approach in the Analects to “hear much but leave to one side that which is doubtful, and speak with due caution concerning the remainder”. Reflecting these rigorous analytic methods, Sima declared that he would not write about periods of history where they was insufficient documentation. As such, Sima wrote “the ages before the Ch’in dynasty are too far away and the material on them too scanty to permit a detailed account of them here”. In the same way, Sima discounted accounts in the traditional records that were “ridiculous” such as the pretense that Prince Tan could via the use of magic make the clouds rain grain and horses grow horns. Sima constantly compared accounts found in the manuscripts with what he considered reliable sources like Confucian classics like the Book of Odes, Book of History, Book of Rites, Book of Music, Book of Changes and Spring and Autumn Annals. When Sima encountered a story that could not be cross-checked with the Confucian classics, he systemically compared the information with other documents. Sima mentioned at least 75 books he used for cross-checking. Furthermore, Sima often questioned people about historical events they had experienced. Sima mentioned after one of his trips across China that: “When I had occasion to pass through Feng and Beiyi questioned the elderly people who were about the place, visited the old home of Xiao He, Cao Can, Fan Kuai and Xiahou Ying, and learned much about the early days. How different it was from the stories one hears!” Reflecting the traditional Chinese reverence for age, Sima stated that he preferred <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>the</b> elderly as he believed that they were the most likely to supply him with correct and truthful information about had happened in the past. During one of this trips, Sima mentioned that he was overcome with emotion when he saw the carriage of Confucius together with his clothes and various other personal items that had belonged to Confucius.|$|E
