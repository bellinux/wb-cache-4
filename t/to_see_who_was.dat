5|$|With the {{publication}} of the accreditation procedures for organisations to access ContactPoint, {{it became clear that the}} vast majority of voluntary organisations would not have been able to access ContactPoint. This meant that the majority of organisations that work with children or young people e.g. sports groups, uniformed groups and faith groups, would not be able to register their involvement, representing a real challenge for practitioners who wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> working with a particular child or young person.|$|E

25|$|In May 1972, two loyalist gunmen {{called to}} the MacBride family's door and Nora MacBride, who was {{carrying}} a baby at the time, went to answer the door. The men duped Mrs. MacBride into opening the door by stating {{that they were looking}} for Frank, a building contractor, and were seeking work. When the door was opened the gunmen then saw Frank coming down the narrow hallway <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> at the door. They opened fire shooting Frank in the shoulder, hand and thighs, then Antoine came out from a side room to protect his father and was shot in the leg. Frank MacBride was hit by 12 bullets and never recovered from the attack, dying 17 months later.|$|E

25|$|Hours {{later as}} the police conduct an {{investigation}} at the crime scene, the investigation seems futile since the brothers covered their tracks by spraying any blood left behind with ammonia. However, Smecker happens upon {{the part of the}} finger lost by Rocco and decides to do an independent investigation <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> behind the gun battle. Smecker is able to track the evidence down to Rocco and his two allies. This leaves Smecker in a difficult scenario, and struggles with the choice of whether to prosecute the three men, or join them in their cause, as Smecker had become sympathetic towards the brothers' actions. After getting drunk at a gay bar and subsequently getting advice from a reluctant priest, Smecker decides to help the trio.|$|E

2500|$|The Somerset county {{historian}} and journalist David Foot wrote: [...] "He was a personable {{rather than an}} astute captain.

2500|$|Siddiqui {{was shot}} and {{severely}} wounded at the police compound the following day. Her American interrogators said she grabbed a rifle from behind a curtain and began shooting at them.

She received medical attention for her wounds at Bagram Air Base and was flown to the US to be charged in a New York City federal court with attempted murder and armed assault on US officers and employees. [...] After receiving psychological evaluations and therapy, the judge declared her mentally fit to stand trial. Siddiqui interrupted the trial proceedings with vocal outbursts and was ejected from the courtroom several times. The jury convicted her on all charges in February 2010.|$|E

[...] Mircovich {{had come to the}} depot from the {{cemetery}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> arriving on the morning train. When he saw Gregovich on the station platform, Mircovich said, [...] "I will get you, you old son-of-a-bitch!" [...] He then stabbed Gregovich with a knife in the chest and groin, puncturing his lung and severing his femoral artery. Doctor Masterson was able to clamp the artery with a hemostat from his medical bag. Deputy Sheriff William Walker immediately apprehended Mircovich, who told him that the murder weapon was his and that Gregovich had taken his money. Despite the efforts of a team of doctors, Gregovich died of shock at 1:00p.m. at Miner's Hospital. At the Nye County Jail, Mircovich told Sheriff Ed Malley that he [...] "wanted to make John Gregovich die", although Malley did not advise him that such statements could be used against him in court.|$|E
