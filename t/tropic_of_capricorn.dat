5|$|Tropical glaciers {{are located}} between the Tropic of Cancer and the <b>Tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Capricorn,</b> {{in the region}} that lies 23° 26′ 22″ north or south of the equator. Strictly, a {{tropical}} glacier is located within the astronomical tropics; the area where the annual temperature variation is less than the daily variation, and is within the oscillation area of the Intertropical Convergence Zone.|$|E
5|$|Middle {{latitude}} glaciers {{are located}} either between the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle, or between the <b>Tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Capricorn</b> and the Antarctic Circle. Both areas support glacier ice from mountain glaciers, valley glaciers and even smaller icecaps, {{which are usually}} located in higher mountainous regions. All are located in mountain ranges, notably the Himalayas; the Alps; the Pyrenees; Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast Ranges of North America; the Patagonian Andes in South America; and mountain ranges in New Zealand. Glaciers in these latitudes are more widespread and tend to be greater in mass the closer they are to the polar regions. They are the most widely studied over the past 150 years. As with examples located in the tropical zone, virtually all the glaciers in the mid-latitudes {{are in a state}} of negative mass balance and are retreating.|$|E

5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{appears to}} be {{generally}} sedentary within its range, especially {{in much of the}} Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. However, in many places (generally south of the <b>Tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Capricorn),</b> populations may be present or absent at different times of the year, although this appears to result from nomadic rather than seasonal migratory movements. Around Wellington in central New South Wales, birds were recorded over winter months, and were more common in autumn around the Talbragar River. Birds were present all year round near Inverell in northern New South Wales, but noted to be flying eastwards from January to May, and westwards in June and July. In Jandowae in southeastern Queensland, birds were regularly recorded flying north and east from March to June, and returning south and west in July and August, and were absent from the area in spring and summer.|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of the Earth is {{approximately}} 23.439281° with {{the axis of}} its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies {{over the course of}} the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and winter taking place when the <b>Tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Capricorn</b> in the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.|$|E

2500|$|Laterite is a {{soil and}} rock type rich in iron and aluminium, and is {{commonly}} {{considered to have}} formed in hot and wet tropical areas. Nearly all laterites are of rusty-red coloration, because of high iron oxide content. [...] They develop by intensive and long-lasting weathering of the underlying parent rock. Tropical weathering (laterization) is a prolonged process of chemical weathering which produces a wide variety in the thickness, grade, chemistry and ore mineralogy of the resulting soils.

The region lies 13° of latitude south of the <b>Tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Capricorn,</b> so tropical plants which are protected for the winter months will flower and fruit in the summer, and cold climate vegetables planted in autumn will mature in early spring. Summers tend to be warm and humid, while winters are relatively mild with frost being a rare event on Waiheke.|$|E
25|$|The {{tropical}} savannah zone of Northern Australia is warm to hot {{all year}} round. Summers are hot {{in most of}} the country with average January maximum temperatures exceeding 30°C over most areas of the mainland, except for those at high elevations though. Winters are warm in the north and cool in the south, with nightly frosts common in inland areas south of the <b>Tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Capricorn.</b> Only at the highly elevated areas do wintertime temperatures approach those found in much of Europe or North America, especially the southern parts.|$|E
25|$|The figure {{shows the}} {{geometry}} of a cross-section of the plane perpendicular to the ecliptic and through the centres of the Earth and the Sun at the December solstice when the Sun is overhead at some point of the <b>Tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Capricorn.</b> The south polar latitudes below the Antarctic Circle are in daylight, whilst the north polar latitudes above the Arctic Circle are in night. The situation is reversed at the June solstice, when the Sun is overhead at the Tropic of Cancer.

50|$|Astronomical timing as {{the basis}} for {{designating}} the temperate seasons dates back at least to the Julian calendar used by the ancient Romans. It continues to be used on many modern Gregorian calendars worldwide, although some countries like Australia, New Zealand, and Russia prefer to use meteorological reckoning. The precise timing of the seasons is determined by the exact times of transit of the sun over the <b>tropics</b> <b>of</b> Cancer and <b>Capricorn</b> for the solstices and the times of the sun's transit over the equator for the equinoxes, or a traditional date close to these times.|$|R

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} planting coffee is to place 20 seeds in each hole {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season. This method loses about 50% of the seeds' potential, as about half fail to sprout. A more effective method of growing coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise seedlings in nurseries that are then planted outside at six to twelve months. Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans, or rice during the first few years of cultivation as farmers become familiar with its requirements. Coffee plants grow within a defined area between the <b>tropics</b> <b>of</b> Cancer and <b>Capricorn,</b> termed the bean belt or coffee belt.|$|R
25|$|Due to the {{precession}} of the equinoxes the December solstice {{no longer}} takes place while {{the sun is}} in the constellation Capricornus, as it did until 130 BCE, but the astrological sign called Capricorn begins with the solstice. The solstice now takes place when the Sun is in the constellation (not the sign) of Sagittarius. The sun's most southerly position, which is attained at the northern hemisphere's winter solstice, is now called the <b>Tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Capricorn,</b> a term which also applies to the line on the Earth at which the sun is directly overhead at noon on that solstice. The Sun is now in Capricorn from late January through mid-February.|$|E
25|$|The {{colony of}} South Australia was settled in 1836, with its western and eastern {{boundaries}} set at 132° and 141° East of Greenwich, {{and to the}} north at latitude 26° South. The western and eastern boundary points were chosen as they marked the extent of coastline first surveyed by Matthew Flinders in 1802 (Nicolas Baudin's priority being ignored). The northern boundary was set at the parallel of latitude 26° South by the British Parliament because that {{was considered to be}} the limit of effective control of territory that could be exercised by a settlement founded on the shores of Gulf St Vincent; the South Australian Company had proposed the parallel of 20° South, later reduced to the <b>Tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Capricorn</b> (the parallel of latitude 23° 37′ South).|$|E
25|$|Species {{diversity}} of the extant cycads peaks at 17˚ 15"N and 28˚ 12"S, with a minor peak at the equator. There is therefore not a latitudinal diversity gradient towards the equator but towards the Tropic of Cancer and the <b>Tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Capricorn.</b> However, the peak near the northern tropic {{is largely due to}} Cycas in Asia and Zamia in the New World, whereas the peak near the southern tropic is due to Cycas again, and also to the diverse genus Encephalartos in southern and central Africa, and Macrozamia in Australia. Thus, the distribution pattern of cycad species with latitude appears to be an artifact of the geographical isolation of the remaining cycad genera and their species, and perhaps because they are partly xerophytic rather than simply tropical.|$|E
5|$|Coconut crabs {{live in the}} Indian Ocean and {{the central}} Pacific Ocean, with a {{distribution}} that closely matches that of the coconut palm. The western limit {{of the range of}} B. latro is Zanzibar, off the coast of Tanzania, while the <b>tropics</b> <b>of</b> Cancer and <b>Capricorn</b> mark the northern and southern limits, respectively, with very few population in the subtropics, such as the Ryukyu Islands. There is evidence that the coconut crab once lived on the mainlands of Australia and Madagascar and on the island of Mauritius, but it no longer occurs in any of these places. As they cannot swim as adults, coconut crabs must have colonised the islands as planktonic larvae.|$|R
