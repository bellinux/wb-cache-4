40|$|In {{this review}} study, it is aimed to examine marinat product {{production}} {{which is being}} applied by our country's fisheries processing sector and {{to contribute to the}} production of quality products for the sector. So, the factors affecting quality during marinat production (pretreatment, brine, material, ripening, draining, packaging, stocking), and the changes in the quality of marinat products (in moisture, in total fat content, in protein content, in crude ash content, in fatty acid content, in pH, in total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) and <b>trimethylamine-nitrogen</b> (TMA-N), in thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values, and in sensory properties) examined...|$|E
40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy at Loughborough University. The present work was undertaken to find a suitable objective quality control method {{for use in the}} crustacean markets and in similar situations. Two main types of objective methods used for fish are Available—these are the chemical methods measuring either the <b>trimethylamine-nitrogen</b> (TMA-N) or the hypoxanthine (Hy) concentrations. However, the "K value" is a more simple method for evaluating the nucleotide degradation than the measurement of (Hy) alone, hence the "K value" was preferred in this work. The "Ornithine Equivalent", the separated ornithine and proline, pH, TMA-N and "K value" of pink (Pandalus montagui) and brown (Crangon crangon) shrimps were investigated. These different measurements were assessed as possible methods for the routine quality control of shrimps...|$|E
40|$|P>Microbial {{activity}} and spoilage of Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) from Greek temperate waters, stored in air at 20, 5 and 0 degrees C was assessed. Microbial spoilage population, Total Volatile-Base Nitrogen (TVB-N), <b>Trimethylamine-Nitrogen</b> (TMA-N), pH and organoleptic changes were determined. Shelf-life of Norway lobster stored at 20, 5 and 0 degrees C was 24, 72 and 96 h respectively. The product was spoiled {{due to the}} development of TVB-N and melanosis of the carapace, as TVB-N was apparent from the early stages of storage and correlated very well with microbial growth and shelf-life. Pseudomonas sp. was the predominant spoilage bacterium. Product rejection coincided with TVB-N levels of 330 - 400 mg kg- 1 and Pseudomonas sp. population level of about 5 x 105 cfu g- 1. Pseudomonas sp. and TVB-N are presumably the Specific Spoilage Organism and the Chemical Spoilage Index of the product...|$|E
40|$|Two {{deteriorative}} pathways (autolysis and microbiological activity) {{were studied}} in farmed Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) for 24 days during chilled storage. These changes were assessed by nucleotide degradation (determination of adenosine 5 '-triphosphate and its degradation compounds) and biochemical (pH; content of total volatile base-nitrogen; <b>trimethylamine-nitrogen,</b> TMA-N; histamine) and microbial (total aerobe mesophiles, TAM; coliforms) indices related to bacterial activity. An important nucleotide degradation could be assessed {{according to the}} fast inosine 5 '-monophosphate formation, followed by degradation into inosine and hypoxanthine; the K value {{was found to be}} an accurate tool for the measurement of quality loss throughout the whole experiment. Regarding bacterial activity, contents of TMA-N and histamine and TAM counts assessment showed sharp increases {{after the end of the}} microbial lag phase (12 - 17 days); however, values obtained for histamine content and TAM growth remained below acceptable security limits throughout the whole experiment...|$|E
40|$|Frozen sprats (Sprattus sprattus sprattus) were thawed and {{separated}} into three lots: two lots were wrapped and kept chilled in a refrigerator at 4 C, one wrapped in aluminum foil (AF), {{the other in}} cling film (CF) and a third lot left unpackaged and held in melting ice. Biochemical tests, performed at intervals over a 16 -day period, showed better quality and an extension of shelf-life for sprats stored unpackaged in ice compared with those held at 4 C packed in AF or CF. The levels of trimethylamine oxide-nitrogen (TMAO-N) decreased throughout storage and significant differences (P < 0. 05) were observed between the lot in ice and the lots stored in AF or CF (P < 0. 05). However, significant differences (P < 0. 05) were not observed between AF and CF lots during the experiment. Increases in total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N) and <b>trimethylamine-nitrogen</b> (TMA-N) were significantly retarded, as were reductions in sensory quality, in the ice-stored fish compared with packaged, refrigerated fish. This work {{was funded by the}} Project QUALPOISS 2 : FAIR PL. 97. 3253 Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Flesh {{concentration}} of Trimethylamine Oxide-Nitrogen (TMAO-N), <b>Trimethylamine-Nitrogen</b> (TMA-N) and Total Volatile Base Nitrogen (TVB-N) {{are the most}} studied parameters used as indices of spoilage in fish and fishery products. In the present work, the official methods to determine TVB-N, TMA-N and TMAO-N were compared with the Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) technique using three different fish species over their storage in melting ice {{for a period of}} 16 days. There was a good correlation between determinations made using official and FIA methods with no apparent significant differences. FIA thus appears to be a suitable method for TMAO-N, TMA-N and TVB-N in fish extract and the use of this system is much faster and simpler than the official methods for determination of these parameters. On the other hand, the individual concentrations of TMAO-N, TMA-N and TVB-N were not found to represent reliable indices of spoilage in fish, which had been frozen and thawed and then presented in chilled format. This work was funded by the Project QUALPOISS 2 : FAIR PL. 97. 3253. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the flesh}} yield and {{proximate}} contents of caramote prawn, Penaeus kerathurus, were researched depending on sex and seasons. Furthermore, prawns {{were divided into}} two groups for freshness assessments at two different times. The first group of prawn was completely wrapped with the stretch film and aluminium foil and stored at room temperature. The second group was placed in water with ice and stored at 4 ± 1 °C (ice storage). The shelf-life of P. kerathurus was determined. <b>Trimethylamine-nitrogen</b> (TMA-N) and pH were analysed to determine biochemical quality and total mesophilic count (TMC) was measured to determine the microbial quality. In addition, sensory analyses were also carried out. The flesh yield of P. kerathurus was on average 52 %. It was found that percentages on average moisture, lipid, protein, and ash contents in P. kerathurus were 76. 27 %, 1. 63 %, 16. 52 %, and 1. 98 %, respectively, and these values changed depending on the season (P< 0. 01). Increases in TMA-N, pH, TMC values and changes in the sensory parameters were found statistically significant (P< 0. 05) in prawns throughout storage. According to sensory, chemical, and microbial analyses, it was found that shelf-life of P. kerathurus wrapped with aluminium foil and stretch film and stored at room temperature was 1 day. The shelf-life of P. kerathurus for ice storage was 9 days...|$|E
