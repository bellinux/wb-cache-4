5|$|During {{the last}} two decades of his life, Josquin's fame spread abroad along with his music. The newly {{developed}} technology of printing made wide dissemination of his music possible, and Josquin was the favorite of the first printers: one of Petrucci's first publications, and the earliest surviving print of music by a single composer, was a book of Josquin's masses which he printed in Venice in 1502. <b>This</b> <b>publication</b> was successful enough that Petrucci published two further volumes of Josquin's masses, in 1504 and 1514, and reissued them several times.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{after the}} {{workshop}} concluded, an 1884 {{edition of the}} Cyrus Cylinder by E. A. Wallis Budge came to Irving Finkel's attention. <b>This</b> <b>publication</b> used an idiosyncratic typeface and featured a handcopy for only {{a section of the}} whole cylinder. However the typeface in that edition matched the paleography on the bone inscriptions and the extract of the cylinder published in the book matched that of the bone as well. This convinced Finkel that the bone inscriptions were early modern forgeries and that has remained the majority opinion since then.|$|E
5|$|He {{published}} his first collection of poems, La coupe de cendres ("The Cup of Ashes") in 1924; {{the same year}} he also translated twelve previously unpublished Malagasy language poems into French and published them in literary magazines, including 18° Latitude Sud in Antananarivo and La Vie in Paris. <b>This</b> <b>publication</b> launched him into the intellectual and cultural circles of Antananarivo high society, where he established himself as Madagascar's leader not only in poetry and prose, but as an esteemed journalist, art critic, translator, and writer of essays and plays.|$|E
5|$|Kami, Perempuan premiered in 1943 in Jakarta. It {{received}} multiple {{performances that}} year, some in Jakarta, some {{in other parts}} of Java.

For <b>this</b> <b>publication</b> Pane removed a scene in which two neighbours came to visit the family, which included further conversation. Pane considered this scene to be anti-climactic, whereas without it the play's title became more appropriate. Another, smaller, change to the play was the removal of the names of Japan's enemies during World War II.|$|E

5|$|The {{score of}} the E-flat major version of Bach's Magnificat was first {{published}} by Simrock in 1811, edited by Georg Pölchau, however with printing errors, and without the Christmas hymns. It was the first composition of Bach for vocal soloists, chorus and orchestra that was printed in orchestral score, {{but at the time}} <b>this</b> <b>publication</b> had little success in sales. When in 1822 young Felix Mendelssohn composed a Magnificat in D major he showed that he knew Bach's version.|$|E
5|$|The weekly strip ran until 1993, {{following}} Roy's playing career {{until its}} conclusion after {{he lost his}} left foot in a helicopter crash. When the monthly comic was launched later that year the focus switched to Roy's son Rocky, who also played for Melchester. <b>This</b> <b>publication</b> was short-lived, and folded after only 19 issues. The adventures of the Race family were subsequently featured in the monthly Match of the Day football magazine, in which father and son were reunited as manager and player respectively.

5|$|Arcadelt wrote over 200 madrigals {{before he}} left Italy in 1551 to return to France, where he spent the {{remainder}} of his life; his numerous chansons date from this and subsequent years. In 1557 he published a book of masses, dedicated to his new employer, Charles de Guise, Cardinal of Lorraine (Arcadelt was maître de chapelle, i.e. choirmaster for him). In <b>this</b> <b>publication</b> he was mentioned {{as a member of the}} royal chapel, and therefore must have served both Henry II (died 1559) and Charles IX during this late phase of his career. In Paris he employed the publishing house of Le Roy and Ballard, who printed his abundant chansons, masses and motets just as the Venetian printers had earlier printed his madrigals.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{there was}} little {{interest}} in the cultivation of Australian plants until the mid-20th century, despite a long-standing appreciation of their beauty as wildflowers. For example, in 1933 and 1934 The Western Mail published a series of Edgar Dell paintings of Western Australian wildflowers, including a painting of B.sessilis. These were subsequently republished in Charles Gardner's 1935 West Australian Wild Flowers. One of the first published colour photographs of the species appeared in William Blackall's 1954 How to know Western Australian wildflowers, but <b>this</b> <b>publication</b> was restricted to plant identification. The species was discussed and illustrated in the 1959 Wildflowers of Western Australia, and in the 1973 Flowers and plants of Western Australia, but these books did not provide cultivation advice either.|$|E
