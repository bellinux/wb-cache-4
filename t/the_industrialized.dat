5|$|Shoe {{manufacturing}} {{improvements in}} the mid-19th century allowed for factories to produce large numbers of shoes made of leather, and later synthetic materials. This increase in leather shoe production continued well into the 20th century {{and led to a}} surge in the number of retail shoe stores in <b>the</b> <b>industrialized</b> world, and subsequently a call for shoe polish by footwear consumers.|$|E
5|$|During {{most of his}} {{own life}} {{conservationism}} wasn't yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in <b>the</b> <b>industrialized</b> world.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{obesity in}} the United States and health {{improvements}} elsewhere contributed to lowering the country's rank in life expectancy from 11th {{in the world}} in 1987, to 42nd in 2007.

Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight. Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic by health care professionals.|$|E

5|$|Railroads {{reached their}} {{maturity}} {{in the early}} 20th century, as trains carried the bulk of land freight and passenger traffic in <b>the</b> <b>industrialized</b> countries of the world. By the mid-20th century, however, they had lost their preeminent position. The private automobile had replaced the railroad for short passenger trips, while the airplane had usurped it for long-distance travel, especially in the United States. Railroads remained effective, however, for transporting people in high-volume situations, such as commuting between the centres of large cities and their suburbs, and medium-distance travel of less than about 300 miles between urban centres.|$|E
5|$|Trucks {{came into}} {{widespread}} {{use in the}} Western World during World War I, and quickly gained reputation {{as a means of}} long distance transportation of goods.

5|$|Until {{the recent}} past, little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the interests of Third World countries.

As more countries have continued to become more developed, the interests of the world have slowly started to shift. However, First World nations still have many more universities, professors, journals, and conferences, which has made it very difficult for Third World countries to gain legitimacy and respect with their new ideas and methods of looking at the world.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Aachen {{was a major}} combat {{action of}} World War II, fought by American and German forces in and around Aachen, Germany, between 12 September–21 October 1944. The city had been {{incorporated}} into the Siegfried Line, the main defensive network on Germany's western border; the Allies had hoped to capture it quickly and advance into <b>the</b> <b>industrialized</b> Ruhr Basin. Although most of Aachen's civilian population was evacuated before the battle began, {{much of the city}} was destroyed and both sides suffered heavy losses. It was one of the largest urban battles fought by U.S. forces in World War II, and the first city on German soil to be captured by the Allies. The battle ended with a German surrender, but their tenacious defense significantly disrupted Allied plans for the advance into Germany.|$|E
25|$|Epidemiological {{data support}} the hygiene hypothesis. Studies {{have shown that}} various {{immunological}} and autoimmune diseases are much less common {{in the developing world}} than <b>the</b> <b>industrialized</b> world and that immigrants to <b>the</b> <b>industrialized</b> world from the developing world increasingly develop immunological disorders in relation to the length of time since arrival in <b>the</b> <b>industrialized</b> world. Longitudinal studies in the third world demonstrate an increase in immunological disorders as a country grows more affluent and, it is presumed, cleaner. The use of antibiotics {{in the first year of}} life has been linked to asthma and other allergic diseases. The use of antibacterial cleaning products has also been associated with higher incidence of asthma, as has birth by Caesarean section rather than vaginal birth.|$|E

25|$|The {{new country}} was a {{multi-ethnic}} state. The population consisted of Czechs (51%), Slovaks (16%), Germans (22%), Hungarians (5%) and Rusyns (4%).
