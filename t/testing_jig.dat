40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of tibial rotation on in situ strain in the peripatellar retinaculum and patellofemoral contact pressures and areas. Patellofemoral joint biomechanics demonstrate a strong correlation with the etiology of patellofemoral disorders, such as chondromalacia, and are significantly influenced by tibial rotation. Six human cadaveric knees were used along with a patellofemoral joint <b>testing</b> <b>jig</b> that permits physiological loading of the knee extensor muscles. Patellofemoral contact pressures and areas were measured with a Fuji pressure-sensitive film, and the changes in in situ strain in the peripatellar retinaculum were measured with four differential variable reluctance transducers. Tibial rotation had a significant effect on patellofemoral joint biomechanics. The data showed an inverse relationship between increasing knee flexion angles and the change in patellofemoral contact pressures and in situ strain with tibial rotation. At higher knee flexion angles, the patella is well-seated in the trochlear groove and the function of the peripatellar retinaculum is minimized and less affected by tibial rotations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, analysis {{and testing of}} a bone plate for mandibular fracture fixation. Conventional bone plates are commonly used to set fractures of the mandible in a surgical setting. If proper alignment between the two bone segments is not achieved, then a malocclusion can result; this condition often causes significant discomfort to the patient, and may require costly and risky revision surgery to repair. Current methods of bone plate fixation require a surgeon to visually align the segments of bone, and once the plate has been affixed to the bone, there is little {{that can be done}} to adjust alignment of the fracture. The modified bone plate presented here has a deformable mid-section, with the purpose of allowing a surgeon to compensate for mis-alignment observed after the plate has been affixed to the fractured bone. The mechanics of deformation associated with various adjustment mechanisms was explored analytically, numerically, and experimentally. It was found that in order to plastically deform the adjustable section, a force of 358. 8 N is required, compared with a predicted value of 351 N obtained using numerical simulations and 487 N using a fixed-fixed beam model with a concentrated central load. In addition to static tests, a dynamic <b>testing</b> <b>jig</b> has been designed with the intent of evaluating in vitro performance of the modified bone plate. Current ASTM and ISO standards for bone plate testing require forces to be applied to the faces of the bone plate, orthogonal to the direction of loading experienced in vivo. This condition is applicable to long bones such as the humerus or femur, however loading conditions of the mandible are significantly different. The <b>testing</b> <b>jig</b> allows for any bone plate of any shape to be fixed such that a force can be applied in order to simulate the normal in vivo loading conditions. This system could be used to further optimize the design of current and future deformable bone plates before they are incorporated into invasive animal or clinical trials. by Thomas Michael Cervantes.

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{deals with}} {{calculation}} of the parameters of ceramic material from a set of destruction tests of ceramic heads of total hip joint endoprosthesis. The standard way of {{calculation of the}} material parameters consists in carrying out a set of 3 or 4 point bending tests of specimens cut out from parts of the ceramic material to be analysed. In case of ceramic heads, {{it is not possible}} to cut out specimens of required dimensions because the heads are too small (if the cut out specimens were smaller than the normalised ones, the material parameters derived from them would exhibit higher strength values than those which the given ceramic material really has). On that score, a special <b>testing</b> <b>jig</b> was made, in which 40 heads were destructed. From the measured values of circumferential strains of the head’s external spherical surface under destruction, the state of stress in the head under destruction was established using the final elements method (FEM).

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of water on the tensile strength of three bonding resins (All Bond 2, Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Adhesive, Clearfil LB Bond) and a low viscosity resin composite (Protect Liner F) after 1, 7, 28, 84 and 168 days of storage. Methods: Cylinders of bonding resin 2. 4 ± 0. 2 mm diameter and 9. 5 mm long were made and stored at 37 °C for 24 hours. The specimens were milled into dumb-bell shapes and stored in either air or water at 370 C. Five specimens of each material were stressed in tension after the specified storage times at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min in a <b>testing</b> <b>jig</b> attached to a universal testing machine. The mean tensile strengths of bonding resins were calculated and analysed statistically using one-way analysis of variance, lower standard deviation and student t-tests. Results: Comparison of the air and water samples at all test periods showed the tensile strengths of specimens stored in water were significantly less than those stored in air (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: The effect of water on the tensile strength of bonding resins indicated a slight decrease in strength of each material over the 168 day test period, whereas the air samples showed little change over the test period. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

METHODS In this laboratory bench study, 3 different surgical knot configurations (4 -throw knot, cow hitch, and simple hitch) using a No. 5 FWC were evaluated and compared with a 1. 25 -mm SSWC. First, distraction tests were performed using bovine femoral cortical half shells mounted on a <b>testing</b> <b>jig.</b> Cerclage tightening, load to a 3 -mm gap opening, and load to total failure were measured. Second, uncemented humeral prosthetic stems were inserted into an experimentally split humeral medullary canal, secured by the cerclage. After 100 N of preloading, the prosthesis was advanced into the humerus at a speed of 0. 2 mm/s, and resistance during subsidence up to a penetration depth of 10 mm, as well as gap opening, was measured. RESULTS Tightening force showed higher values for SSWC (618 N) than FWC (131 - 137 N) (P <. 001). Load to total failure was comparable among the 3 different FWC knots (2, 642 - 2, 804 N), which were significantly stronger than SSWC (1, 775 N, P <. 001). At 3 mm of distraction, SSWC (1, 820 N), cow hitch (1, 803 N), and single-throw hitch (1, 709 N) performed significantly better than a 4 -throw knot (1, 289 N) (P <. 01). Subsidence testing showed no difference in force restraint or gap opening between the best FWC and SSWC.

40|$|PURPOSE: In practice, {{the surgeon}} {{must rely on}} screw {{position}} (insertion depth) and tactile feedback from the screwdriver (insertion torque) to gauge compression. In this study, we identified the relationship between interfragmentary compression and these 2 factors. METHODS: The Acutrak Standard, Acutrak Mini, Synthes 3. 0, and Herbert-Whipple implants were tested using a polyurethane foam scaphoid model. A specialized <b>testing</b> <b>jig</b> simultaneously measured compression force, insertion torque, and insertion depth at half-screw-turn intervals until failure occurred. RESULTS: The peak compression occurs at an insertion depth of 2 ̆ 2123. 1 mm, 2 ̆ 2122. 8 mm, 0. 9 mm, and 1. 5 mm for the Acutrak Mini, Acutrak Standard, Herbert-Whipple, and Synthes screws respectively (insertion depth is positive when the screw is proud above the bone and negative when buried). The compression and insertion torque {{at a depth of}} 2 ̆ 2122 mm were found to be 113 1 18 N and 0. 348 1 0. 052 Nm for the Acutrak Standard, 104 1 15 N and 0. 175 1 0. 008 Nm for the Acutrak Mini, 78 1 9 N and 0. 245 1 0. 006 Nm for the Herbert-Whipple, and 67 1 2 N, 0. 233 1 0. 010 Nm for the Synthes headless compression screws. CONCLUSIONS: All 4 screws generated a sizable amount of compression (> 60 N) over a wide range of insertion depths. The compression at the commonly recommended insertion depth of 2 ̆ 2122 mm was not significantly different between screws; thus, implant selection should not be based on compression profile alone. Conically shaped screws (Acutrak) generated their peak compression when they were fully buried in the foam whereas the shanked screws (Synthes and Herbert-Whipple) reached peak compression before they were fully inserted. Because insertion torque correlated poorly with compression, surgeons should avoid using tactile judgment of torque as a proxy for compression. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the insertion profile may improve our understanding of the implants, provide a better basis for comparing screws, and enable the surgeon to optimize compression.

40|$|The {{physiologic}} {{forces are}} essential for proper functioning and longevity of the patellofemoral joint. However, the abnormal forces in the patellofemoral joint {{are thought to have}} a strong correlation with patellar disorders in both the intact knees and the knees with total knee arthroplasty. Aims of this thesis were to develop biomechanical testing methods and devices to quantitatively assess the structural integrity of the patellofemoral joint as well as specific parameters for patellar resurfacing in total knee arthroplasty. To quantify the patellofemoral joint kinematics, contact areas, and contact pressures, custom patellofemoral joint testing jigs, a continuous video digitizing system and a three dimensional magnetic tracking system and a custom software for the Fuji pressure sensitive film were developed. Six biomechanical studies were performed. The first study showed that the increase in degree of fixed femur rotation resulted in a nonlinear increase in patellofemoral contact pressures on the contra-lateral facets of the patella in seven human cadaver knees. For total knee arthroplasty studies, anatomically based patellar resection criteria was first determined. This patellar resection criteria yielded a consistent and ideal resection for dome shaped patellar prosthesis in 36 patellae. Thereafter, using ten human cadaver knees, the effects of total knee arthroplasty was quantified. The results showed a significant decrease in the patellofemoral joint contact areas while the patellofemoral joint contact pressures increased well beyond the yield strength of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene following total knee arthroplasty. No statistically significant differences between preoperative and postoperative specimens were observed with respect to the patellofemoral joint kinematics. The effects of patellar component positioning were then determined in five human cadaver knees with total knee arthroplasty. The findings showed the central positioning of the patellar component resulted in the most optimal patellofemoral mechanics for dome shaped patellar prosthesis. The patellofemoral joint <b>testing</b> <b>jig</b> was then improved to simulate individual muscles of the quadriceps. We then determined the effects of anatomically based loading of the patellofemoral joint versus the traditional axial loading approach where a subtle yet significant differences in patellofemoral joint mechanics were quantified. Using this model, we demonstrated excessive edge loading of patellar components at higher knee flexion angles in two contemporary total knee arthroplasty systems with anatomic patellofemoral joints. Abnormal distribution of stresses resulting from improper kinematics of the patellofemoral joint has a strong correlation with patellar disorders in both the intact knees and the knees with total knee arthroplasty. Therefore, the greatest deficit in current knowledge of the patellofemoral joint biomechanics is still the understanding of the structure, function and the forces involved in the patellofemoral joint and its interactions with the extensor mechanism as well as the intra-articular patellofemoral joint contact pressures...|$|E

40|$|There are {{two ways}} in which the testing may be initiated, {{remotely}} or locally. If the remote operation is desired, an external TTL level signal must be provided to the <b>test</b> <b>jig</b> with the remotellocal switch {{on the side of the}} <b>test</b> <b>jig</b> switched to remote. A logic high will initiate the test. A logic low will terminate the test. In the event that an external signal is connected to the <b>test</b> <b>jig</b> while local operation occurs, the local control takes precedence over remote control. Once a DVT has been locked in the ZIF socket and the DIP switches are selected, the Push-to-Test button may be depressed. Momentarily depressing the button will initiate a test with a minimum 400 ms duration. At the same time a PBCLOCK and PBLATCH pulses will be initiated and the power rails + 12 V, + 8 V, and - 6 V will be ramped to full voltage. The time at which the power rails reach the full voltage is about 13 ms and it is synchronized with bypass capacitors placed on COMP input of U 20 and U 22 and on the output of U 23 voltage regulators. The voltage rails are supplied to a {+-} 10 % window comparator. A red LED indicates the rail is below or above 10 % of the design value. A green LED indicates the rail is within acceptable limits. For DDT with a 5 pF and 10 pF feed back capacitor, the + 12 V and + 8 V rails are current-regulated to 19 rnA and 22 rnA respectively and the - 6 V rail is short-circuit protected within the regulator. For DUT with a 22 pF feed back capacitor the current regulation is the same as above except that the + 8 V rail is current regulated to 43 rnA. The power rails are supplied to the DUT via a 10 {Omega} resistor. The voltage drop across this resistor is sensed by a differential amplifier AD 620 and amplified by a gain of 10. An external BNC connection is provided from this point to allow for current measurements by the vendor. The current value for each rail is calculated by measuring the voltage value at this point and divided by (10 * 10 {Omega}). The next stage inverts and amplifies the voltage signal by a factor of 5 for + 12 V and - 6 V rails and by a factor of 1 for + 8 V rail. For DUT with 22 pF feed back capacitor the amplification factors are same as above except that the amplification factor for + 8 V rail is a gain of 2. An offset null potentiometer is provided between the AD 620 and the inverting stage which eliminates device offset current errors. The inverted and amplified voltage is presented to two window comparators. One of them compares the inverted and amplified voltage to the low threshold point and the other one compares the inverted and amplified voltage to the high threshold point. If the inverted and amplified voltage is within the low and high threshold points, both the low and the high current LEDs illuminate green indicating the current is within acceptable limits.

For packages, duroid (teflon) substrate and solder connections are employed; the chip version is functionally identical, but eliminates solder joints and uses quartz substrate for the microstrip circuits. Impedances are tunable over a wide range, using broadband open-circuited stub lines. Substrate processing techniques including vacuum evaporation, plating and photolithographic etching were developed to enable rapid realization of any desired microstrip pattern...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Bending and {{subsequent}} stretching of sheet materials {{is typical of}} many sheet forming operations. Bending and bend-stretching characteristics and limit strain of monolithic AA 2024 and laminated tri-layer Alclad 2024 aluminum sheet materials are studied by modeling and experimentation. A computationally efficient analytical model based on advanced bending theory is developed for the laminated sheet materials and utilized to predict the bending characteristics of the above sheet materials. The effects of cladding thickness ratio on the bending characteristics of laminated sheet are compared with the monolithic constituent. Also, predictions from the above analytical bending model are compared with 2 D and 3 D FE-based bending models. In addition, bend-stretching experiments are conducted using a specialized <b>test</b> <b>jig</b> while continuously recording images using dual-camera set-up from tensile surface and edge of the specimen. A stochastic pattern {{is applied to the}} specimen prior to the test and the images are later processed to analyze the development and localization of strains based on digital image correlation (or DIC) method. Strain maps from DIC analysis are utilized to determine the limit strain {{in the vicinity of the}} bend line, as well as from FE modeling of bend-stretching tests, using maximum major strain acceleration criterion for localized necking proposed by one of the authors. The results from experimental and modeling work indicate higher limit strains in bend-stretching for Alclad 2024 compared to monolithic AA 2024 sheet...|$|R
40|$|Magnetocaloric cooling is an alternative, high-efficiency cooling technology. In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design and}} {{fabrication}} of a micromachined magnetocaloric cooler and demonstrate its ability {{to work in a}} small magnetic field ð 51 : 2 TÞ with a cooling test. The cooler was built by fabricating Si microfluidic channels, and it was integrated with a Gd 5 ðSi 2 Ge 2 Þ magnetocaloric refrigeration element. The magnetic properties of the Gd 5 ðSi 2 Ge 2 Þ material were characterized to calculate the magnetic entropy change at different ambient temperatures. Three different methods to integrate the channel layer and the magnetocaloric element were evaluated to test sealing and cooling performance. The cooling tests were performed by providing a magnetic field using an electromagnet. A <b>test</b> <b>jig</b> was constructed between the poles of an electromagnet to maintain a steady temperature during the test. Cooling tests were performed on the magnetocaloric element at ambient temperatures ranging from 258 to 280 K using a magnetic field of 1. 2 T. Experimental results showed a maximum temperature change of 7 K on the magnetocaloric element alone at an ambient temperature of 258 K. Cooling tests of the fully integrated coolers were also performed. A solution of anti-freeze fluid (propylene glycol) and water was used as the coolant. The temperature of the working fluid decreased by 4. 6 and 9 K for the glass and Si intermediate layers, respectively, confirming that the thermal conductivity of the materials is also an important factor i...|$|R
40|$|Electrical drives lie at {{the heart}} of most {{industrial}} processes and make a major contribution to the comfort and high quality products we all take for granted. Electrical drives involving different types of electrical motors turn the wheels of industry. In an industrialized country, more than 60 % of the generated electrical energy is used in motor drives. The application of electrical drives spread from low fractional horse power applications in instruments to the industrial applications. Wide power, torque and speed ranges, adaptability to almost every operating condition, high efficiency, fast response, control simplicity, ability to operate as a generator in braking mode and various mechanical design types make the electrical drive very competitive among the other drive types. This work is based on the Robust Control Adjustable Electrical DC Drive System using PI (Proportional Integrator) controller. It encompasses the development of the DC drive. It also includes the design and fabrication of the mechanical load wheel structure. Thus the work finally gave a product in the form of a <b>test</b> <b>jig</b> for checking the wear and tear of a small metallic material after being spring pressed and scrubbed on the edged copper face of the aluminum disk wheel. The integrity of the system is based on keeping the wheel speed constant. In nullifying the steady state error the PI control algorithm was eventually used with root locus design method that could enable finding the PI coefficients. It turns out to be a robust and resilient drive that keeps the load wheel spee...|$|R

40|$|The {{proposed}} use of Carbon Fibre Composite {{material in}} future aircraft projects {{has led to}} the initiation of many research programmes internationally. Much of the work is concentrated around the electrical performance and properties the material. Investigations have shown that Carbon Fibre Composites possess poor electrical conductivity relative to metals, which influences the electromagnetic properties of a structure comprised of Carbon Fibre Composite materials. The internal electromagnetic environment of a structure for a given impinging electromagnetic field {{is a function of the}} structure's material, its joints or seams, size, shape, and number of areas that have low conductivity. The level of electromagnetic field penetration for a given structure constructed from Carbon Fibre Composites is an important consideration in the electromagnetic hazard protection design of the systems. This problem must be addressed with confidence in order to produce design specifications for equipment, optimise system installation and understand system integration within the structure. The aim of this research is to further the understanding of the electrical current flow, both A. C. and D. C., through practical aircraft standard joints constructed in Carbon Fibre Composite. The investigations incorporate consideration of the D. C. conditions of the joint and measurements in the frequency band 1 MHz to 50 MHz utilising a dual plate transmission line. The results of these investigations show that a current flow through a jointed structure can be predicted using a theoretical finite difference model. The behaviour of current flow through the C. F. C. material was also assessed using simple theory, and shown to have good agreement with measurements of the D. C. properties of the material and joints. Finally, it was demonstrated that measurements of the A. C. properties of the, joint up to 50 MHz can be attained by utilising a simple dual plate transmission line <b>test</b> <b>jig...</b>|$|R

In the early development stage of cellular phones, {{the behavior of the}} display modules due to drop impact is <b>tested</b> using <b>jigs</b> where the display modules are installed. In this study, jigs of cellular phones for drop impact test of OLED modules were designed. The material, thickness and number and orientation of ribs were considered as design variables. Jigs were designed in a way that responses of modules due to drop impact were similar to those of modules in cellular phones. The maximum principal stresses at the upper glasses of modules were considered as responses, which were analyzed using a commercial software ABAQUS/Explicit. The drop impact analysis at the height of 1. 5 meters showed that the responses o...|$|R
