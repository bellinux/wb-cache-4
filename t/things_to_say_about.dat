25|$|Dilthey {{was also}} {{interested}} in what some would call sociology in the 21st century, although he strongly objected to being labelled as such, as the sociology of his time was mainly that of Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. He objected to their dialectical/evolutionist assumptions about the necessary changes that all societal formations must go through, {{as well as their}} narrowly natural-scientific methodology. Comte's idea of positivism was, according to Dilthey, one-sided and misleading. Dilthey did, however, have good <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the neo-Kantian sociology of Georg Simmel, with whom he was a colleague at the University of Berlin. Simmel himself was later an associate of Max Weber, the primary founder of sociological antipositivism. J. I. Hans Bakker has argued that Dilthey should be considered one of the classical sociological theorists due to his own influence in the foundation of nonpositivist verstehende sociology and the Verstehen method.|$|E

Chris (Rob Lowe) suggests Andy tap into the aspects of his personality April was attracted to in the first place. However, the only things he can think of are that he is nice and {{he is in a}} band. Andy decides to be nice to Eduardo, and the two realize they have similar musical tastes (they both like the Dave Matthews Band) and end up bonding over a guitar session. April becomes frustrated because she only dated Eduardo to make Andy jealous. She dumps Eduardo, which Chris interprets as a sign that his efforts are succeeding. Ann (Rashida Jones), who was nervous about Andy and Chris spending time together, is relieved when Chris tells her that Andy had nothing but positive <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> her.

Chris Barsanti of Filmcritic.com has commented that around the time the tenth season aired, [...] "not only did the show start losing its status as untouchable—read: everyone stopped expecting every episode to be a masterpiece—it also developed the bad habit of building episodes around celebrity guests, who were practically never as amusing as {{they were meant to}} be." [...] Michael Passman of The Michigan Daily wrote in 2007 that [...] "in hindsight, the 10th season can now be seen as a tipping point of sorts for a number of the show's less attractive plot devices. Homer's get-rich-quick schemes start to become all too prevalent, and there are an inordinate amount of unnecessary celebrity cameos." [...] Passman did not only have negative <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the tenth season though. He commented that it [...] "is not the last great 'Simpsons' season ever. The last great season was the eighth. The last really good season was the ninth. But the tenth is just pretty good, nothing more, nothing less." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Guardian, the {{journalist}} and broadcaster Lesley Riddoch {{took a different}} view, suggesting that the launch of a pro-independence newspaper {{in a country where}} 45% of the population had recently voted for independence [...] "may be a large but calculated risk and a very sound business move", and that [...] "Perhaps the novelty and sheer boldness of the National newspaper will match the national mood". Kirkpatrick, although critical of its online shortfalls, was positive about the paper's content, describing it as [...] "a lively mix of briefs and longer pieces". Douglas Beattie of the New Statesman said The National [...] "has a clear raison d’etre and will be welcomed by a large number of the 1.6 million Scots who voted Yes". Stephen Daisley of STV News wrote that it was [...] "both frustratingly light [...] stodgily worthy", but drew favourable comparisons with the Scottish Standard, a weekly pro-independence paper launched in 2005 that ceased publication after just seven issues, suggesting The National would succeed because it had more financial backing, and as there was a latent demand for a news sheet supporting independence. Writing in The Guardian, {{the journalist}} and author Peter Preston said there were [...] "many good <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the National" [...] including its editor, who was leading a newspaper that [...] "helps to reflect public opinion better".|$|E

The video primarily consists of Spears, whilst wearing cowboy boots, performing the song whilst standing {{on the edge of a}} cliff, and inside a cave: despite her [...] "trepidation" [...] and heavy winds which [...] "almost dropped [...] over", she performed the scene without a safety cable. Isham praised Spears' attitude to the filming of the scene, claiming that she [...] "had not a blink of fear" [...] during the shoot, Spears is sitting on top of a cliff, surrounded by cliffs. Isham also considered the music video one of his favorites, commenting that he had [...] "nothing but positive <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> my experience with her and what she's doing right now" [...] and that Spears [...] "stepped into it with positive energy.

In general, [...] "Bein' Green" [...] was considered less impressive than [...] "Take Care of Yourself", though it had its supporters: Votta and Bell both referred to it as [...] "a nice introduction", and West declared that his [...] "simple, clear-voiced ode to being an outsider rang true and was hauntingly beautiful", and gave it an [...] "A−". Canning was not impressed: [...] "Perhaps if it had been sung with more feeling, it could have worked better." [...] For [...] "Take Care of Yourself", both West and Goldberg agreed with Rachel's assessment that the performance was [...] "magical", and West graded it with an [...] "A+". The Los Angeles Times Amy Reiter was [...] "blown away", and Chaney gave it an [...] "A" [...] with the comment that Rory [...] "handled it with adorable aplomb". Slezak and VanDerWerff, however, thought the number was somewhat sleep-inducing.|$|E

[...] OK! Magazine also noted that [...] "some are calling the 13-year-old signed singer the next Justin Bieber." [...] After watching the video, singer Chris Brown said: [...] "Honest opinion? It was great. I'll be jammin' to it on Friday, Friday." [...] Fellow teenage singer Miley Cyrus denied that she had criticized Black, saying [...] "I am a fan" [...] and that she sang [...] "Friday" [...] while driving. Simon Cowell praised Black, saying [...] "I love her [...] the fact that she's gotten so much publicity. People are so upset about the song, but I think it's hysterical. [...] Anyone who can create this much controversy within a week, I want to meet. I love people like that." [...] He observed that [...] "any song to do with the weekend annoys you. It reminds me of 'Saturday Night'... It's what we call a 'hair-dryer song,' a song girls sing into their hair dryers as they're getting ready to go out.

60|$|There is in {{this matter}} an {{extraordinary}} tendency to vague and unmeaning criticism. The usual way of criticising an author, particularly an author who has added something to the literary forms of the world, is to complain that his work does not contain something which is obviously the speciality of somebody else. The correct <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Maeterlinck is that some play of his in which, let us say, a princess dies in a deserted tower by the sea, has a certain beauty, but that we look in vain in it for that robust geniality, that really boisterous will to live which {{may be found in}} Martin Chuzzlewit. The right <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Cyrano de Bergerac is that it may have a certain kind of wit and spirit, but that it really throws no light on the duty of middle-aged married couples in Norway. It cannot be too much insisted upon that at least three-quarters of the blame and criticism commonly directed against artists and authors falls under this general objection, and is essentially valueless. Authors both great and small are, like everything else in existence, upon the whole greatly under-rated. They are blamed for not doing, not only what they have failed to do to reach their own ideal, but what they have never tried to do to reach every other writer's ideal. If we can show that Browning had a definite ideal of beauty and loyally pursued it, {{it is not necessary to}} prove that he could have written In Memoriam if he had tried.|$|R
40|$|The first <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Pan Panâs {{performance}} of Beckettâs 1956 radio play is this: if youâre planning {{on going to}} it, please donât read this review â {{it would be a}} shame to spoil the surprise that awaits you. And perhaps the second important point is how refreshing (and unusual) it is to be surprised by an Irish production of a play by Beckett â a writer whose works are usually treated so reverentially that theyâre in danger of becoming museum pieces. While this is a very faithful rendition of the play, Pan Pan provide an experience that is genuinely different from anything youâll have encountered in the theatre before...|$|R
500|$|Rolling Stone {{credited}} West with transforming hip hop's mainstream, [...] "establishing a {{style of}} introspective yet glossy rap [...] ", and called him [...] "as interesting and complicated a pop star as the 2000s produced—a rapper who mastered, upped and moved beyond the hip-hop game, a producer who created a signature sound and then abandoned it to his imitators, a flashy, free-spending sybarite with insightful <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> college, culture and economics, an egomaniac with more than enough artistic firepower to back it up." [...] West's middle-class background, flamboyant fashion sense and outspokenness have set him apart from other rappers. Early in his career, {{he was among the}} first rappers to publicly criticize the preponderance of homophobia in hip hop. The sales competition between rapper 50 Cent's Curtis and West's Graduation altered the direction of hip hop and helped pave the way for new rappers who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold. Rosie Swash of The Guardian viewed the sales competition as a historical moment in hip-hop, because it [...] "highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative." [...] West's 2008 album 808s & Heartbreak polarized listeners upon its release, but was commercially successful and impacted hip hop and pop stylistically, as it laid the groundwork for a new wave of artists who generally eschewed typical rap braggadocio for intimate subject matter and introspection, including Frank Ocean, The Weeknd, Drake, Future, Kid Cudi, Childish Gambino, Lil Durk, Chief Keef, and Soulja Boy. According to Ben Detrick of XXL magazine, West effectively led a new wave of artists, including Kid Cudi, Wale, Lupe Fiasco, Kidz in the Hall, and Drake, who lacked the interest or ability to rap about gunplay or drug-dealing. In 2013, Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Spin described West as fronting a [...] "new art-pop era" [...] in contemporary music, in which musicians draw widely on the visual arts as a signifier of both creative exploration and extravagant wealth.|$|E

The British journalist and commentator Bryan Appleyard recently wrote in the Sunday Times that the “hard stuff” in science was no longer attracting so many readers.
