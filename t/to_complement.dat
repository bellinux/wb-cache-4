5|$|A logical {{extension}} of the humanist sans-serif concept is the font superfamily: a serif font and a matching humanist sans-serif with similar letterforms.

40|$|Using domain switch {{chimeric}} antibodies, we {{confirm the}} important role of CH 2 in complement activation. In addition, we demonstrate that the structures responsible for the differential ability of human IgG 1 and IgG 4 <b>to</b> activate <b>complement</b> are located at the COOH-terminal part (from residue 292 to 340) of the CH 2 domain. The amino acids in CH 2 that might be involved in complement interaction are discussed. While CH 3 contributes <b>to</b> efficient <b>complement</b> activation, CH 3 from IgG 2 and CO IgG 3 are equally effective. The ability <b>to</b> activate the <b>complement</b> cascade and thereby remove pathogenic agents {{is one of the most}} important effector functions of the antibody molecule. IgM and IgG are the only isotypes that activate the classical complement pathway. The four human IgG isotypes have very similar amino acid sequences, but differ markedly in their ability <b>to</b> activate <b>complement.</b> IgG 3 and IgG 1 are effective in activating complement, IgG 2 fixes complement poorly, and IgG 4 appears completely deficient in the ability <b>to</b> activate <b>complement</b> (1...|$|R
