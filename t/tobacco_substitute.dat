5000|$|While {{the smoking}} of {{cigarettes}} containing the dried leaves of Atropa species {{for the purpose}} of relieving asthma symptoms is well documented in the history of modern medicine, the practice of smoking Atropa leaves as a recreational drug in the period predating the upsurge of interest in such drugs among the Beat Generation of the 1950s and in the hippie subculture of the 1960s is neither well-known nor well-researched. That the tobacco-related common names for Atropa baetica in Spanish cited above demonstrate that the plant really has been smoked as a <b>tobacco</b> <b>substitute</b> in Spain is confirmed by an ethnobotanical observation made by Prof. Font i Quer, who states that A. baetica is smoked by the shepherds of la Sagra. (The geographical designation la Sagra generally refers in Spain to a part of the Submeseta Sur (a part, in turn of the Meseta central), although it is possible (given the distribution of A. baetica [...] ) that the Sierra de la Sagra (a mountain range further to the South of the Submeseta) may be intended). Font i Quer goes on to compare this smoking of A. baetica with the occasional smoking of A. belladonna in the Catalan (i.e. Eastern) part of the Pyrenees (where one of A. belladonna 's common names, in the Catalan language is tabac bord - compare name tabaco borde for A. baetica in Spanish). In neither instance, however, does he enlarge upon his observations, making no mention of the time of year at which the leaves were gathered, whether they were cured like tobacco or merely dried, how much of the leaf material was smoked at one time etc. - all of which would affect the amount of tropanes absorbed by these smokers of Atropa leaves and thus the degree of their intoxication.|$|E
5000|$|The {{attempt to}} assassinate Hitler on 20 July 1944 failed in its primary objective, {{but it did}} greatly unsettle the Nazi leadership. Some years earlier the Nazis had {{compiled}} a list of communist and socialist politicians and activists from the Weimar years who might be rounded up {{in the event of a}} deterioration in the domestic political situation. By 1944 the list was somewhat out of date, many of those named on it having already been murdered or died from natural causes, but Hilde Radusch, whose name was also on the list, was very much alive and, by this stage, working in a bank. The mass roundup of political opponents was nevertheless implemented overnight on 22/23 August 1944. Fortunately Eddy Klopsch had a friend in the police service who warned the women of the government's intentions, and they were able to escape in time to avoid capture. [...] They spent the rest of the war years hiding in a large allotment shed in Prieros, a hamlet set in marshy countryside between Berlin and Cottbus, that was for most purposes far from the beaten track, and where they had purchased a piece of land when first they got together, back in 1940. They had already used it, in 1943, to hide Erna Hackbarth, the partner of , after she had managed to escape from a concentration camp. [...] However, now they had to survive in it themselves, without any ration coupons. There were occasions when Radusch managed to exchange a bed sheet for meat. They were sometimes able to find wood for heating themselves in the woods, and they learned to concoct a <b>tobacco</b> <b>substitute</b> from blackberries. Nevertheless, by the time Berlin was destructively liberated by the Red army in April/May 1945 they were starving. [...] The end of the war found the entire central portion of what had been Germany administered as the Soviet occupation zone. Radusch threw herself into the vast reconstruction effort that now began. Between June 1945 and February 1946 she was employed in the district [...] "Victims of Fascism" [...] department for the district government of Schöneberg, processing claims for emergency food and clothing. [...] In 1946 she was a co-instigator of a [...] "child rescue" [...] ("Rettet die Kinder") project. At the same time, seeing Soviet communism arriving in Germany with the Red army, she now began to nurture doubts about the Communist Party which had been the focus of her politics for more than twenty years. [...] She took a decision to resign from it and made her intention known. In January 1946 the local party leadership anticipated her resignation, however, and expelled her, using her lesbian relationship to justify the move. She was also bombarded with threatening letters, and denounced her to her employers at the town hall. When she went to see her boss to clarify matters, she found a thick personnel file, containing statements from three leading communists, denouncing her as a lesbian, for which reason she should no longer be employed in a public office. The comrades had their way, and in February 1946 she lost her job. [...] Wartime deprivation had also taken its toll, and by now she was suffering from Rheumatoid arthritis. A few years later she was forced to take early retirement, supported by a very meagre pension.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTobacco smoke {{contains}} more than 5600 constituents, of which approximately 150 are toxicants. This paper describes the activities in the Neutral Red uptake (NRU) assay, the Salmonella mutagenicity test (SAL), the mouse lymphoma mammalian cell mutation assay (MLA) and the in vitro micronucleus test (IVMNT) of Particulate Matter (PM) obtained from experimental cigarettes (ECs), designed to produce reduced levels of toxicants. The designs included <b>tobacco</b> <b>substitute</b> sheet (TSS) containing glycerol, which dilutes toxicants in smoke, or the incorporation of blend-treated (BT) tobacco to reduce the levels of nitrogenous toxicant precursors and some polyphenols. All samples were cytotoxic in the NRU, however TSS reduced PM cytotoxicity in this assay. All PMs were mutagenic in the SAL, MLA and IVMNT. Reductions in bacterial mutagenicity were observed in the SAL, for cigarettes with BT tobacco, compared with their respective controls.

Toxicant yields from the ECs were compared with those from two commercial comparator cigarettes, three scientific control cigarettes measured contemporaneously and with published data on 120 commercial cigarettes. The ECs were found to generate some of the lowest machine yields of toxicants from cigarettes for which published HCI smoke chemistry data are available; these comparisons therefore confirm that ECs with reduced MS machine toxicant yields compared to commercial cigarettes can be produced.

40|$|Summary. -The topical {{carcinogenicity}} to mouse skin {{of smoke}} condensates ob-tained from a <b>tobacco</b> <b>substitute</b> (NSM), {{alone or in}} combination with tobacco, has been compared with condensate from tobacco and with acetone, the solvent used. Sixteen different types of cigarette were {{used to make the}} condensates, and the age-standardized results have been analysed according to the Weibull distribution model. The results show that NSM condensate has less than 25 % of the potency of tobacco condensate (37 0 at 95 0 upper confidence limit), and that condensates from blends of NSM and tobacco are similarly reduced in activity. General pathology analysis failed to reveal abnormalities due to NSM. THE chemical complexity of cigarette smoke precludes the precise attribution of the known carcinogenic effects to a single component or group of components, and animal models are therefore required to assay carcinogenic activity. A model commonly used is the topical application of smoke condensates to mouse skin, and measurement of the incidence of tumours which result. The method has been much used to monitor attempts at reduction of the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke, and although there is as yet no evidence equating mouse skin response with the human lung response, it is assumed that a direct relationship exists between the ability to induce tumours in mouse skin and in the human bronchial tract. The experiments described were de-signed to determine the carcinogenic potential of smoke condensate from a substitute smoking material and from blends of this material with conventional tobacco.

40|$|Background: Over {{the past}} ten years or so, there is a huge {{increase}} in the popularity of electronic cigarettes around the world. Some people regard e-cigarettes as a <b>tobacco</b> <b>substitute</b> and use them to help smoking abstinence and relieve nicotine withdrawal symptom. On the other hand, there are those who believe that e-cigarettes should not be promoted since safety and efficacy of these battery-operated devices are still under investigation. Hence, this project aims to evaluate the effect of using electronic cigarettes to quit smoking among the conventional smokers. Methods: This project used key words to search on PubMed, MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, 中国知网(CNKI), EMBASE, and BBCNEWS. Eventually, a total of 111 items in PubMed, 6 in The Cochrane Library and 23 were obtained in CNKI. After the screening process, finally 11 relevant papers were reviewed in this project. There were two randomized controlled trials on evaluating the effect of reducing smoking with e-cigarettes. Five surveys(Survey 1 - 5) analyzed users’ satisfaction and their original expectations on trying electronic cigarettes. Two proof-of-concept trials also assessed the effect of using e-cigarettes on reducing and quitting smoking. In addition, a qualitative study and a case series study provided evidence on interpreting whethere-cigarettes could help smoking abstinence. Results: Brown et al. 10 conducted a RCT and showed that in an intention to treat analysis, combined ≥ 50 % smoking reduction and complete smoking abstinence was shown in 33 % (99 / 300) at 12 weeks and 19 % (57 / 300) at 52 weeks. Another RCT conducted by Bullen et al. showed the continuous abstinence at 1 month was 23. 2 %in nicotine e-cigarettes group and 15. 9 %in nicotine patches group and 16. 4 %in placebo e-cigarettes group; at 3 month, the rateswere 13. 1 %, 9. 2 % and 6. 8 %; at 6 months, the rates were 7. 3 %, 5. 8 % and 4. 1 %. In survey 1 (Etter), satisfaction of helping smokers quit was 79 %; in survey 2 (Kralikova et al.), satisfaction of helping quit was over 60 %; in survey 3 (Dawkins et al. 14), participants reported their situation of smoking cessation: 38 % for > 1 year, 19 % for 6 - 11 months, 43 % for < 6 months;in survey 4 (Etter and Bullen), 92 % current smokers and 96 %former smokers reported ECs were effective to reduce their smoking consumption; in survey 5 (B. Siegel et al.), 66. 8 % smokers reported it helped quitting smoking. In two proof-of-concept trials, sustained quitting more than 50 % including quitter accounted for 55 % and 64. 3 %. Thequalitative study and the case series study indicated that ECs were modestly effective to reduce smoking consumption with less toxic effects. Conclusion: There is some preliminary evidence from 11 studiesthatelectronic cigarettes could be effective for reducing conventional smoking consumption within a short period. Because {{there is a lack of}} adequate and long-term randomized controlled trials to assess the safety and efficacy of e-cigarettes, particularly in comparison to nicotine replacement therapy, government regulations should be established to control e-cigarettes and to the claim that e-cigarettes can be used as a standard as nicotine smoking cessation aid. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|E
40|$|The Lhoba {{are a small}} ethnic group, {{located in}} the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. Until 1960, their {{livelihood}} was predominantly based on swidden agriculture, hunting, and gathering. To investigate and document the plant species used by the Lhoba, ethnobotanical surveys were conducted in three villages of Nanyi Township in Milin County, Tibet, China. Ethnobotanical surveys were conducted in three Lhoba villages using key informant interviews and semi-structured interviews. Plants traditionally used by the Lhoba were documented. Data obtained were analyzed through informant consensus factor analysis (FIC) to determine the homogeneity of the informants’ knowledge of medicinal plants. Fifty-nine plant species belonging to 49 genera and 28 families were recorded and collected. Twenty-eight species are ethnomedicinal plants, 29 are local edible plants, and 23 are used for other purposes in Lhoba daily life. The medicinal plant species are used for treating eight categories of illness. Most medicinal plants are herbs (71. 4 %) or roots (39. 2 %). Nutrition adjustment (FIC = 0. 76) and dermatological infections (FIC = 0. 56) showed the highest FIC, indicating that the Lhoba had {{the highest level of}} agreement about the use of plants for these two illness categories. Fruit is the most frequently used part of the edible plants. Nine edible plant species are used as herbal medicine. Plant species used for other purposes include, six species for fuel, five for dye material, six for religious use, four for timber, two for <b>tobacco</b> <b>substitutes,</b> and one for fodder. Some traditional technologies and customs of Lhoba, such as dyeing and bamboo weaving, have remained the same for centuries. In contrast, the Lhoba’s knowledge of ethnomedicine has been recently influenced by traditional Tibetan and Chinese medicine, resulting in the loss of traditional knowledge in this sector. In addition, the development of tourism has influenced a change in the Lhoba lifestyle and their production of traditional products. These events signal the need to invest in mechanisms that can enable the Lhoba to benefit from the use of their traditional plant-derived culture and therefore support the continued conservation and use of these important plant resources.

40|$|Significance: Electronic cigarettes, {{also known}} as ecigarettes, are devices {{designed}} to imitate regular cigarettes and deliver nicotine via inhalation without combusting tobacco. They are purported to deliver nicotine without other toxicants {{and to be a}} safer alternative to regular cigarettes. However, little toxicity testing has been performed to evaluate the chemical nature of vapour generated from e-cigarettes. The aim {{of this study was to}} screen e-cigarette vapours for content of four groups of potentially toxic and carcinogenic compounds: carbonyls, volatile organic compounds, nitrosamines and heavy metals. Materials and methods: Vapours were generated from 12 brands of e-cigarettes and the reference product, the medicinal nicotine inhaler, in controlled conditions using a modified smoking machine. The selected toxic compounds were extracted from vapours into a solid or liquid phase and analysed with chromatographic and spectroscopy methods. Results: We found that the e-cigarette vapours contained some toxic substances. The levels of the toxicants were 9 - 450 times lower than in cigarette smoke and were, in many cases, comparable with trace amounts found in the reference product. Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with the idea that <b>substituting</b> <b>tobacco</b> cigarettes with e-cigarettes may substantially reduce exposure to selected tobacco-specific toxicants.

40|$|Background Price-based {{mechanisms}} {{are an important}} tobacco cessation policy tool in New Zealand (NZ) and so measurement of smokers’ reaction to price changes is crucial in determining efficacy of this approach. Although approximately two-thirds of NZ tobacco demand is for manufactured cigarettes (MC) and one-third is for Roll-Your-Own (RYO) tobacco, previous price elasticity estimates have ignored differences between RYO tobacco and MC consumers. Methods We employ a seemingly unrelated regression econometric approach applied to quarterly data over the period 1991 – 2011 to estimate price elasticities of demand separately for MC and RYO tobacco. Results Estimate of price elasticity of demand for MC is − 1. 033, and − 0. 441 for RYO tobacco. RYO tobacco is an inferior good; a 1 % increase in average weekly income {{is associated with a}} 0. 8 % reduction in demand. RYO <b>tobacco</b> is a <b>substitute</b> for MC; a 1 % increase in the price of MC is associated with a 0. 867 % increase in demand for RYO tobacco. Conclusions There is significantly different price responsiveness across the two tobacco product types. MC smokers react far more strongly to price increases compared with RYO tobacco smokers. These findings suggest that pricing mechanisms may be more effective for reducing MC demand than for RYO tobacco. However, substitution between products means that this pricing effect is muted by the uptake of RYO tobacco use.

Although {{much has been written about}} the role of tobacco in traditional Native-American cultures, little is known about modern-day perceptions of tobacco among American-Indian adolescents. METHODS: This study conducted focus groups of 40 American-Indian adolescents in urban and rural areas of Southern California. Participants discussed the role of traditional ceremonial tobacco use in their lives, the use of commercial <b>tobacco</b> as a <b>substitute</b> for sacred <b>tobacco,</b> the perceived safety of traditional versus commercial tobacco, and the perceptions of American-Indian imagery in tobacco advertising. RESULTS: Many American-Indian adolescents may be introduced to traditional tobacco use at early ages. Smoking is viewed as a sign of respect for the elders, but there are acceptable ways for adolescents to participate in ceremonies without inhaling smoke. Commercial cigarettes often are <b>substituted</b> for homegrown <b>tobacco</b> at ceremonies and events.

40|$|This paper aims {{to deliver}} {{empirical}} {{evidence on the}} links between production efficiency, biodiversity, and resource management by analysing a case study on small-scale tobacco production in the Miombo woodlands in Tanzania. The subsistence nature of tobacco production in Tanzania suggests that most power-driven equipments, fertilizers and sustainable crop processing technologies are {{beyond the reach of}} most small-scale tobacco growers. The consequence is that in order to expand their production, <b>tobacco</b> farmers heavily <b>substitute</b> such inputs by an increasing use of wood. Hence, an increasing amount of forest land is cleared by the farmers resulting in forest degradation and a loss of biodiversity. This study determines in a first step the efficiency of tobacco production bordering the Miombo woodlands in Tanzania as well as investigates factors for the relative inefficiency on farm level. In a second step, the relation between forest species diversity in the surrounding woodlands and tobacco production efficiency as well as between diversity and the type of institutional arrangement with respect to forest management are empirically analysed. The results indicate that the different efficiency measures vary widely over the sample, showing a significant positive effect of the curing technology–i. e., the design of the barn–and the source of the firewood. The majority of farmers produce with increasing returns to scale. A strong positive correlation between the tobacco production efficiency and forest diversity as well as between community-based arrangements and forest diversity is revealed. This suggests that an increase in agricultural production efficiency with respect to tobacco is conducive for environmental sustainability in Tanzania. It finally supports property rights-based institutional arrangements for the management of forest resources as such motivate the sustainable management of unreserved forest resources...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} smoke and smoke {{fractions}} from <b>tobacco</b> and a <b>substitute</b> smoking material (NSM) on the DNA content of mammaliam cells in culture were measured. Tobacco smoke caused significant (P less than 0. 001) changes in the DNA content of all the mammalian cells exposed compared with controls. NSM smoke {{did not have a}} significant effect on the DNA content of the exposed cells (P less than 0. 95). Smoke from blends of NSM and tobacco caused changes in DNA content in proportion to the amount of tobacco in the mixtures. Condensate from cigarettes containing tobacco or blends of tobacco and NSM caused significant (P less than 0. 001) changes in DNA content of mammalian cell populations in culture, whereas equal weights of condensate from NSM alone or NSM containing nicotine did not cause significant changes (P less than 0. 05). NSM produces 28 % of the weight of condensate per cigarette in comparison with tabacco and would, therefore, be expected to be far less biologically active than tobacco. Filtered smoke from cigarettes containing tobacco caused significant (P less than 0. 001) changes in the DNA content of mammalian cells in culture. These changes were quantitatively similar to those caused by whole smoke suggesting that the gas phase of cigarette smoke is biologically more reactive than the particulate phase. The filtered smoke from the substitute smoking material NSM did not cause significant (P less than 0. 95) changes in DNA content of cultured mammalian cells. Filtered smoke from blends of NSM and tobacco caused changes in DNA content in proportion to the amount of tobacco in the mixture...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{disposal}} of effluents {{on land and}} subsequent pollution of groundwater and soil of surrounding farmlands {{is a relatively new}} area of research. Environmenal and socio-economic aspects of industrial effluent irrigation have not been studied as extensively as domesticsewage based irrigation practices, at least for developing countries like India. Disposal of treated and untreated industrial effluents on land has become a regular practice for some industries. Industries located in Mettupalayam taluk, Tamilnadu dispose their effluents on land, and the farmers of the adjacen farmlands have complained that their shallow open wells get polluted and also the salt content of soil has started building up slowly. This study attempts to capure the environmental and socio-economic impacts of industrial effluent irrigation in different industrial locations at Mettupalayam taluk through primary surveys and secondary information. This study found that coninuous {{disposal of}} industrial effluents on land, which has limited capacity to assimilate the pollution load, has led to groundwater pollution. Ground water quality of shallow open wells surrounding the industrial locations has deteriorated, and the application of polluted groundwater fo irrigation has resulted in increased salt conent of soils. In some locations drinking water wells (deep bore wells) also have high concentration of salts. Since the farmers had already shifted their cropping pattern to salt toleran crops (like jasmine, curry leaf, <b>tobacco</b> etc.) and <b>substituted</b> their irrigation source from shallow open wells to deep bore wells and/or river water the impact of pollution on livelihood was minimised. Since the local administration is supplying drinking water to households the impact in the domestic secor has been minimised. It has also been noticed that in some locations industries are supplying drinking water to the affected households. However, if the pollution continues unabated it could pose serious problems in the future. effluents, groundwater, pollution, salt conent of soils, Mettupalayam, Tamilnadu, India...|$|R
30|$|Cigarette smoking causes serious {{diseases}} through {{frequent and}} prolonged exposure to toxicants. Technologies {{are being developed}} to reduce smokers’ toxicant exposure, including filter adsorbents, <b>tobacco</b> treatments and <b>substitutes.</b> This study examined the effect of modifications to filter ventilation, variations in cigarette circumference and active charcoal filter length and loading, as well as combinations of these features in a reduced-toxicant prototype (RTP) cigarette, on the yields of toxicants in cigarette smoke. An air-dilution mechanism, called split-tipping, was developed in which a band of porous paper in {{the centre of the}} filter tipping functions to minimise the loss of effective filter ventilation that occurs at the high flow rates encountered during human-smoking, and to facilitate the diffusional loss of volatile toxicants. As compared with conventional filter ventilation cigarettes, split-tipping reduced tar and volatile smoke constituent emissions under high flow rate machine-smoking conditions, most notably for products with a 1 -mg ISO tar yield. Furthermore, mouth level exposure (MLE) to tar and nicotine was reduced among smokers of 1 -mg ISO tar cigarettes in comparison to smokers of cigarettes with traditional filter ventilation. For higher ISO tar level cigarettes, however, there were no significant reductions in MLE. Smaller cigarette circumferences reduced sidestream toxicant yields and modified the balance of mainstream smoke chemistry with reduced levels of aromatic amines and benzo[a]pyrene but increased yields of formaldehyde. Smaller circumference cigarettes also had lower mainstream yields of volatile toxicants. Longer cigarette filters containing increased levels of high-activity carbon (HAC) showed reduced machine-smoking yields of volatile toxicants: with up to 97 % removal for some volatile toxicants at higher HAC loadings. Split-tipping was combined with optimal filter length and cigarette circumference in an RTP cigarette that gave significantly lower mainstream (up to ~ 90 %) and sidestream (predominately 20 %– 60 %) smoke yields of numerous toxicants as compared with a commercial comparator cigarette under machine-smoking conditions. Significantly lower mainstream and sidestream smoke toxicant yields were observed for an RTP cigarette comprising several toxicant reducing technologies; these observations warrant further evaluation in clinical studies where real-world relevance can be tested using biomarkers of exposure and physiological effect.|$|R
