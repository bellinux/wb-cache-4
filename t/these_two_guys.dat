He found a piece of marching band music that was a band {{intentionally}} playing poorly, but sound designer Jeff Hutchins said, [...] "You could still discern the tune." [...] Hutchins thought [...] "Well, let's take this one step further. What if they couldn't even play their instruments, let alone a tune?" [...] He brought his portable DAT recorder to a musical instrument retail store and met two men who worked on its loading dock, packaging and shipping the instruments.

She also revealed that she ran in shoes {{that she had not}} broken in and they made her feet bleed. The actress added [...] "It was incredibly stressful but I guess it was stress in a good way. There were months of preparation involved so that it could run like clockwork. So I guess it was stressful in the sense the emotional stakes were heightened for a two-week period. It was exhausting and I think we can all say we were happy once it was over. But the final result was worth it." [...] McGregor filmed his final scene out of sequence at the Melbourne studios. He explained that they had already shot Mark's last scene on location, then went back inside to do the studio shots.

I read the script and thought how weird, this is a sort of LA male's version of an English girl's {{childhood}} and then I read the books and I thought wow, there is something here that relates to me growing up that I hadn't seen in the script. I thought this could be a British genre film or be like Clueless or Mean Girls in England and I liked the idea of doing a British version of those films.

5000|$|Another critic wrote: [...] "Inspired by a viral YouTube {{video and}} deftly {{directed}} by Linda Bloodworth-Thomason (Designing Women), Bridegroom {{is about an}} unmarried gay couple in their 20s {{and what happens when}} one of them dies.

[...] Another review stated, [...] "For many, it’s precisely the sort of emotional eye-opener needed for young people to find inspiration and naysayers to reconsider their attitudes.". [...] The reviewer went on to say, [...] "In lieu of telling the story via simple white captions, the documentary relies on straightforward talking-head interviews with Crone’s family and the couple’s shared circle of friends, who describe how <b>these</b> <b>two</b> closeted small-town <b>guys</b> clicked when they met in Los Angeles, quickly forming the kind of relationship that romantics everywhere envy." ...|$|R

The two men were tasked to cook {{three meals a day}} from home-grown ingredients while living three days a week in a rural village in Jeongseon County, Gangwon Province. Though the concept seemed simple, Lee and Ok, both city dwellers, had difficulty cultivating the vegetable garden and harvesting from the farm animals and the sorghum field, such that they struggled to feed themselves (and weekly celebrity guests) to comical results. Na said, [...] "All cooking shows do not have to feature fancy, delicious food. We seek the sincerity that comes from cooking with all their hearts.
