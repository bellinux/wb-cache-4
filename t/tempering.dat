5|$|Quenching {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, {{which is just a}} specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (<b>tempering)</b> process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E

5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which are cold {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, {{in two or three}} stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and <b>tempering</b> to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E
5|$|The main {{disadvantage}} to {{die casting}} {{is the very}} high capital cost. Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly, as compared to most other casting processes. Therefore, to make die casting an economic process, a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high-fluidity metals, and casting weights must be between 30grams (1oz) and 10kg (20lb). In the standard die casting process the final casting will have {{a small amount of}} porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable. Parts needing hardening (through hardening or case hardening) and <b>tempering</b> are not cast in dies.|$|E

5|$|During the Yayoi {{period from}} about 300BC to 300AD, iron tools and weapons such as knives, axes, swords or spears, were {{introduced}} to Japan from China via the Korean peninsula. Shortly after this event, Chinese, Korean, and eventually Japanese swordsmiths produced ironwork locally. Swords were forged to imitate Chinese blades: generally straight chokutō with faulty <b>tempering.</b> Worn slung from the waist, they were likely used as stabbing and slashing weapons. Although functionally it would generally be more accurate to define them as hacking rather than slashing weapons. Swordmaking centers developed in Yamato, San'in and Mutsu where various types of blades such as tsurugi, tōsu and tachi were produced. Flat double-edged (hira-zukuri) blades originated in the Kofun period, and around the mid-Kofun period swords evolved from thrusting to cutting weapons. Ancient swords were also religious objects according to the 8th century chronicles Nihon Shoki and Kojiki. In fact, one of the Imperial Regalia of Japan is a sword, and swords have been discovered in ancient tumuli or handed down as treasures of Shinto shrines or Buddhist temples. Few ancient blades (jokotō) exist because the iron has been corroded by humidity.|$|E
5|$|Phan's {{men were}} well-trained and disciplined, and the {{military}} inspiration behind his rebellion was derived from Cao Thang, a bandit leader who had been protected from royal forces by Phan's brother a decade earlier. They operated in the provinces of Thanh Hóa in the north, Hà Tĩnh, Nghệ An in the centre and Quảng Bình in the south, with their strongest areas being the two central provinces. In 1887, Phan concluded that his tactics were misguided, ordering his subordinates to cease open combat and resort to guerrilla tactics. His men built up a network of base camps, food caches, intelligence agents and peasant supply contacts. Phan traveled to the north {{in the hope of}} coordinating strategic and tactical plans with other leaders. In the meantime, Cao Thang led a force of around 1,000 men with some 500 firearms between them. Cao Thang produced around 300 rifles by disassembling and copying 1874-model French weapons that had been captured. For the purpose of creating such replica guns, they captured Vietnamese artisans. According to French officers who later captured some of the Vietnamese copies, the weapons were proficiently reproduced. The only details in which they were regarded as being defective were in the <b>tempering</b> of the springs, which were improvised with umbrella spokes, and the lack of rifling in the barrels, which curtailed range and accuracy.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{made from}} cast iron through oxygenation: The {{earliest}} known production of steel {{is a piece}} of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia (Kaman-Kalehoyuk) and is about 4,000 years old. Other ancient steel comes from East Africa, dating back to 1400 BC. In the 4th century BC steel weapons like the Falcata were produced in the Iberian Peninsula, while Noric steel was used by the Roman military. The Chinese, who had been producing cast iron from the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC), produced steel by the 2nd century BC through a process of decarburization, i.e. using bellows to pump large amounts of oxygen on to molten cast iron. This was first described in the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) book Huainanzi, compiled by scholars under Prince Liu An (179–122 BC). For steel, they used both quenching (i.e. rapid cooling) and <b>tempering</b> (i.e. slow cooling) methods of heat treatment. Much later, the American inventor William Kelly (1811–1888) brought four Chinese metallurgists to Eddyville, Kentucky in 1845, whose expertise in steelmaking influenced his ideas about air injection to reduce carbon content of iron; his invention anticipated the Bessemer process of English inventor Henry Bessemer (1813–1898).|$|E

This study examined a set of hypotheses related to: (a) the prevalence of <b>temper</b> outbursts in paediatric OCD, (b) the associations of <b>temper</b> outbursts with OCD severity and depressive symptoms; and (c) the influence of <b>temper</b> outbursts on treatment response. Methods:  The prevalence of <b>temper</b> outbursts was estimated in a specialist OCD clinical sample (n = 387) using parent- and child-report. This was replicated in a community sample (n = 18, 415). Associations of <b>temper</b> outbursts with obsessive-compulsive symptoms and with depressed mood were examined using logistic regression models. The influence of <b>temper</b> outbursts on treatment response was examined in a subsample of 109 patients treated with cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) with or without medication. Results:  Over a third of young people with OCD displayed <b>temper</b> outbursts, and rates were similar across the clinical and community samples. <b>Temper</b> outbursts were {{two to three times}} more common in youth with OCD than in healthy controls. However, OCD symptom severity was not a strong predictor of child- or parent-reported <b>temper</b> outbursts. Instead, both child- and parent- reported <b>temper</b> outbursts were significantly associated to depressive symptoms. CBT strongly reduced OCD and depressive symptoms, as well as the severity of <b>temper</b> outbursts. There {{was no significant difference in}} post-treatment OCD or depression scores between those with <b>temper</b> outbursts compared to those without. Conclusions:  <b>Temper</b> outbursts are common in youth with OCD and are particularly related to depressed mood. They improve with CBT for OCD and do not seem to impede OCD treatment response...|$|R

5|$|The {{transition}} from straight jokotō or chokutō to deliberately curved, {{and much more}} refined Japanese swords (nihontō), occurred gradually {{over a long period}} of time, although few extant swords from the transition period exist. Dating to the 8th century, Shōsōin swords and the Kogarasu Maru show a deliberately produced curve. Yasutsuna from Hōki Province forged curved swords that are considered to be of excellent quality. Stylistic change since then is minimal, and his works are considered the beginning of the old sword (kotō) period, which existed until 1596, and produced the best-known Japanese swordsmiths. According to sources Yasutsuna may have lived in the Daidō era (806–809), around 900; or more likely, was a contemporary of Sanjō Munechika and active in the Eien era (987, 988). The change in blade shape increased with the introduction of horses (after 941) into the battlefield, from which sweeping cutting strokes with curved swords were more effective than stabbing lunges required of foot soldiers. Imparting a deliberate curve is a technological challenge requiring the reversal of natural bending that occurred when the sword edge is hammered. The development of a ridge (shinogi) along the blade was essential for construction. Various military conflicts during the Heian period helped to perfect the techniques of swordsmanship, and led to the establishment of swordsmiths around the country. They settled in locations close to administrative centers, where the demand for swords was high, and in areas with easy access to ore, charcoal and water. Originally smiths did not belong to any school or tradition. Around the mid to late-Heian period distinct styles of workmanship developed in certain regional centers. The best known of these schools or traditions are the gokaden (five traditions) with each producing a distinct style of workmanship and associated with the five provinces: Yamashiro, Yamato, Bizen, Sagami/Sōshū and Mino. These five schools produced about 80% of all kotō period swords. Each school consisted of several branches. In the late Heian period Emperor Go-Toba, a sword lover, summoned swordsmiths from the Awataguchi school of Yamashiro, the Ichimonji school of Bizen and the Aoe school of Bitchū Province to forge swords at his palace. These smiths, known as goban kaji　(honorable rotation smiths) are considered to have been the finest swordsmiths of their time. Go-Toba selected from the Awataguchi, Hisakuni and Ichimonji Nobufusa to collaborate on his own <b>tempering.</b> Early Kamakura period tachi had an elaborately finished tang and an elegant dignified overall shape (sugata). Tantō daggers from the same period showed a slight outward curvature.|$|E

Thus, characterizing specific behavioral manifestations of <b>temper</b> loss along a dimension from normative misbehaviors to clinically significant problems {{is an important step}} toward identifying clinical thresholds. Methods Parent-reported patterns of <b>temper</b> loss were delineated in a diverse community sample of preschoolers (n = 1, 490). A developmentally sensitive questionnaire, the Multidimensional Assessment of Preschool Disruptive Behavior (MAP-DB), was used to assess <b>temper</b> loss in terms of tantrum features and anger regulation. Specific aims were: (a) document the normative distribution of <b>temper</b> loss in preschoolers from normative misbehaviors to clinically concerning <b>temper</b> loss behaviors, and test for sociodemographic differences; (b) use Item Response Theory (IRT) to model a <b>Temper</b> Loss dimension; and (c) examine associations of <b>temper</b> loss and concurrent emotional and behavioral problems. Results Across sociodemographic subgroups, a unidimensional <b>Temper</b> Loss model fit the data well. Nearly all (83. 7 %) preschoolers had tantrums sometimes but only 8. 6 % had daily tantrums. Normative misbehaviors occurred more frequently than clinically concerning <b>temper</b> loss behaviors.

40|$|AbstractThe initial <b>temper</b> of the {{material}} may directly affect the whole creep age forming (CAF) process. In terms of creep deformation and stress relaxation, using the constant-stress creep aging and constant-strain stress relaxation aging tests, the relationship between initial <b>temper</b> and CAF formability is investigated for an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy at 165 °C for 18 h. Three <b>tempers</b> are selected as the initial <b>tempers</b> in CAF, viz., solution, retrogression and re-solution. The CAF formability of this alloy with initial <b>temper</b> of retrogression is the best, and the creep strain of the retrogression <b>tempered</b> specimen after creep aging of 18 h is about 1. 21 and 1. 34 times {{than that of the}} solution and the re-solution <b>tempered</b> specimens, respectively. The calculated stress exponents of this alloy with three initial <b>tempers</b> range from 7. 3 to 9. 5, indicating that the CAF of this alloy is mainly controlled by the dislocation creep. The various formability for three initial <b>tempers</b> are attributed to different inhibitions of the transgranular precipitates on the dislocation movement. For the retrogression <b>temper,</b> the initial fine and uniformly distributed precipitates are seriously coarsened after 6 h of CAF, which minimally inhibit the dislocation movement.
