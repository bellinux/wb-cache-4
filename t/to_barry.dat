5|$|According to Diane Dimond of Hard Copy, Torbiner's {{records show}} that Robinul and Vistarol was {{administered}} instead of sodium amytal. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was investigating Torbiner's administration of drugs in house calls, where he mostly gave patients morphine and Demerol. His credentials with the Board of Dental Examiners indicated that he was restricted by law to administering drugs solely for dental-related procedures, {{but he had not}} adhered to those restrictions. For instance, he had given general anesthetic <b>to</b> <b>Barry</b> Rothman during hair-transplant procedures. Torbiner had introduced Chandler and Rothman in 1991, when Rothman needed dental work.|$|E

Building work began there in the winter and the gates opened to campers on 18 June 1966. Butlin retired in 1969 and the Barry Island camp was the last opening under his management.|$|E

50|$|A heroic {{version of}} Top {{is part of}} the 25th Century cops known as The Renegades, from Professor Zoom's future. When the Renegades attempt <b>to</b> arrest <b>Barry</b> for a crime he will commit in the future, Top {{abandons}} his team <b>to</b> help <b>Barry,</b> attempting <b>to</b> prevent the events that lead <b>to</b> <b>Barry's</b> accusation. Once he convinces <b>Barry</b> <b>to</b> let him help, it appears as though he is actually framing Barry for a crime he committed. It is subsequently revealed that Top is actually attempting <b>to</b> prevent <b>Barry</b> from investigating previous 'cold cases' in order to leave an innocent man in jail, as the man who actually committed the crime is an ancestor of the future Top; the future Top spent his whole life training to join the Renegades, but the organisation will not allow members in if anyone in their families (no matter how far back) has a criminal record, prompting Top to set up events to ensure that his ancestor stays out of prison so that he can achieve his 'dream'. Informing Top that he cannot be a hero under the circumstances he is trying <b>to</b> set up, <b>Barry</b> vibrates inside Top's body and destroys his suit from the inside, subsequently leaving him for the Renegades to take back to their future.|$|R
2500|$|On February 9, 2009, {{prosecutors}} filed {{a motion}} in federal court <b>to</b> revoke <b>Barry's</b> probation for not filing his 2007 tax return, which violated his probation. According <b>to</b> one prosecutor, <b>Barry</b> has not filed his taxes eight of the last nine years. Barry said the reason he did not file his taxes is because of distractions from his medical problems, although he noted that there is [...] "no excuse" [...] for not filing. In an interview, Barry {{said he has been}} undergoing four-hour dialyses three times a week as treatment for a problem with his kidney. At that point, a kidney donor had been identified, but the operation had yet to be scheduled. On February 17, WTOP-FM reported that, according <b>to</b> <b>Barry's</b> attorney, Barry had filed his federal and District tax returns for 2007. The same day, <b>Barry</b> was admitted <b>to</b> Howard University Hospital to prepare for a kidney transplant the next day. Barry was released from the hospital on February 27, but he was readmitted on March 2 due to large amounts of air in his abdominal cavity and also due <b>to</b> <b>Barry's</b> complaints of serious pains, both of which were caused by the combination of medications Barry was taking after the operation. Barry was released from the hospital on March 6. On April 17, 2009, the prosecution withdrew their request <b>to</b> revoke <b>Barry's</b> probation.|$|R

Mulder—against Agent Kazdin's orders—tells Barry that he believes his story, convincing him to let two more hostages go. However, when Mulder questions whether Barry is lying, he becomes enraged. Mulder tricks Barry into approaching the front door where Barry is shot by a sniper.|$|E
5|$|Several {{newspapers}} published {{images of}} Tomlinson's {{first encounter with}} police that evening.

An eyewitness, IT worker Ross Hardy, said Tomlinson was drunk and refusing to move; a police van tried to nudge him out of the way, and when that didn't work he was moved by four riot officers. The newspaper published a second image of him apparently being pushed by the police. On 16 April The Guardian published three images of Tomlinson taken at the same time.|$|E

The pier at Burnham-on-Sea was used for commercial goods, {{one of the reasons}} for the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway was to provide a link between the Bristol Channel and the English Channel. The pier at Burnham-on-Sea is the shortest pier in the UK. In the 1970s the Royal Portbury Dock was constructed to provide extra capacity for the Port of Bristol.|$|E

5|$|The {{script for}} the {{production}} was written by Lloyd F. Lonergan, who employed the deus ex machina dramatic technique in {{the conclusion of the}} plot. In film, this is the sudden inheritance and parents finding their children in the theater. The two children, Orilla Smith and Yale Boss, were child actors with prior film experience and did not have any further known connection to the Thanhouser Company after the production. The cameraman, Blair Smith, used a camera rented by the Columbia Phonograph Company and had its inventor, Joseph Bianchi, assist in the camera's operation and use. The director of has both been credited <b>to</b> <b>Barry</b> O'Neil and Lloyd B. Carleton in numerous trade sources. Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser Company, but this film was not the Thanhouser Company's first subject. Instead, it was The Mad Hermit produced in autumn 1909 and shelved until August 9, 1910. The exact order of the productions is not known, but a work titled Aunt Nancy Telegraphs was filmed in December 1909 and never released. Certain parts of The Actor's Children were produced in the last week of February 1910.|$|E

5|$|Barry is {{described}} as the most famous St. Bernard by the Natural History Museum of Bern. Following his death, his skin was preserved by a taxidermist for the museum, {{while the rest of}} his body was buried. He was originally given a humble and meek pose, as the taxidermist felt that this would serve as a reminder of servitude to future generations. In 1923, his body was refurbished by Georg Ruprecht, as his coat had become brittle and had broken into more than 20 pieces. During the restoration, his body was re-posed and his skull shape was modified to match the shape of the St. Bernard of that time, in a compromise between Ruprecht and the Museum's director. His original head shape was rather flat with a moderate stop, with the modification resulting in a larger head with a more pronounced stop. A barrel was added hanging from his collar, following the popularization of the myth of the monastery's dogs using these during the rescues, which was originally introduced by Edwin Landseer's work Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveller. The barrel was removed in 1978 by Professor Walter Huber, the director of the museum, although it has since been replaced. A monument <b>to</b> <b>Barry</b> is located opposite the entrance to the Cimetière des Chiens in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} of has both been credited <b>to</b> <b>Barry</b> O'Neil and/or Lloyd B. Carleton by film historian Q. David Bowers. It {{is not known}} for certain who directed or if both them played a directorial {{a role in the}} production. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company for a short time, moving to Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. The confusion between the directing credits stems from the industry practice of not crediting the film directors, even in studio news releases. There is also dispute over the cameraman credit for the film. Bower credits Blair Smith as the cameraman, but the American Film Institute adds that Carl Louis Gregory also could have been the cameraman. Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. Bowers believes that numerous releases were produced with Gregory operating the camera, but the role was uncredited in the 1910 era. Anna Rosemond was one of two leading ladies for {{the first year of the}} company. Rosemond joined in the autumn of 1909 and in their first year of productions. Frank H. Crane was involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company from 1909. Crane's was the first leading man of the company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser.|$|E
