5|$|The {{music for}} the 2011 neo-noir detective video game L.A. Noire, {{developed}} by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games, was composed by musicians Andrew Hale and Simon Hale. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, the score also features contributions from Woody Jackson, who had collaborated with Rockstar on previous projects. Andrew Hale felt that composing the game's score was about setting a mood, attempting to compose music that felt accessible to players. The score was inspired by films from the 1940s, though the team avoided specifically composing for this time period, instead opting <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> after the music had been produced. Three supplementary vocal recordings were composed by The Real Tuesday Weld and performed by Claudia Brücken; they also sought to fit with the game's setting.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} what was then known as Scary Movie went on sale on a Friday in June1995, but {{received}} no bids. By the following Monday, the script had become {{the subject of a}} significant bidding war among a host of established studios, including Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, and Morgan Creek Productions. Producer Cathy Konrad read the script and felt it was exactly what the Weinstein brothers of the fledgling Dimension Films — then a part of Miramax — were looking for. Dimension had previously released several horror films and intended <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> genre. Konrad brought the script to Bob Weinstein's assistant, Richard Potter. Believing it had potential, he brought it to Weinstein's attention. Studios began {{to drop out of the}} bidding as the price of the script increased, and the final two bidders were Oliver Stone, who was at the time working under Cinergi Pictures, and the Weinsteins of Dimension Films. Williamson agreed to a bid of $400,000 from Miramax, plus a contract for two sequels and a possible fourth unrelated film. Williamson said he chose Dimension because he believed they would produce Scary Movie immediately and without significantly censoring the violence in the script. Craven read the script before he became involved in the production, and considered convincing a studio to buy it for him to direct. However, by the time Craven read the script, it had already been sold.|$|E

Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "We thought there was more material left over from No Line... we now feel a long way from that material." [...] The dance-centric album was ultimately aborted as well; Clayton said, [...] "The work we did with RedOne was very, very exciting.

2500|$|In the UK the {{nomenclature}} {{is slightly}} different from North America. [...] This article primarily uses the North American terminology. [...] Although {{there is some}} adoption of the former naming conventions it has been normal to categorise lanterns by their lens type, so that what in the US {{is known as a}} spotlight is known as a Profile or a Fresnel/PC (Pebble/Plano/Prism Convex) focused tightly on a specific area of the stage (either by repositioning the lens, or by using barndoors) in the UK. A Spotlight in the UK often refers to a Followspot, or any lantern in general which has been focused tightly into a small area. The following definitions are from a North American point of view.
