50|$|In 1994, Coker Tire {{released}} a radial tire {{with a wide}} whitewall, which was a first of its kind. Coker now sells many brands that offer whitewall radial tires, and distributes a modern radial tire that has the narrow <b>tread</b> <b>profile</b> and distinct shoulders of a vintage bias ply tire. These tires are very popular with enthusiasts who want the vintage look, with the increased driving comfort of a radial tire. Coker Tire also has a Performance Division, which sells mostly drag racing tires. Coker sells Phoenix Race Tires, M&H Racemaster, Pro-Trac, Hoosier Pro Street Radials, and select Firestone vintage tires through its performance division. Coker has also developed a line of Firestone Indy tires, built {{for a variety of}} vintage Indy cars.|$|E
40|$|The tread of a tyre {{consists}} of a profile (pattern of grooves, sipes, and blocks) mainly designed to improve wet performance and inhibit aquaplaning by providing a conduit for water to be expelled underneath the tyre as it makes contact with the road surface. Testing different <b>tread</b> <b>profile</b> designs is time consuming, as it requires fabrication and physical measurement of tyres. We propose a supervised machine learning method to predict tyres’ aquaplaning performance based on the <b>tread</b> <b>profile</b> described in geometry and rubber stiffness. Our method provides a regressor from the space of profile geometry, reduced to images, to aquaplaning performance. Experimental results demonstrate that image analysis and machine learning combined with other methods can yield improved prediction of aquaplaning performance, even using non-normalised data. Therefore this method has can potentially save substantial cost and time in tyre development. This investigation is based on data provided by Continental Reifen Deutschland GmbH...|$|E
50|$|A flange {{climbing}} derailment {{can result}} if {{the relationship between}} these forces, L/V, is excessive. The lateral force L results not only from centrifugal effects, but a large component is from the crabbing of a wheelset which has a non-zero angle of attack during running with flange contact. The L/V excess can result from wheel unloading, or from improper rail or wheel <b>tread</b> <b>profiles.</b> The physics of this is more fully described below, in the section wheel-rail interaction.|$|R
5000|$|HSFV1 was {{intended}} for fundamental empirical research into wheel-rail interaction and suspension dynamics to be better understood, following from work on wheel <b>tread</b> <b>profiles.</b> It was regularly run at speeds of up to 140 mph (225 km/h) on the Vehicles Laboratory's roller rig. It also performed at 90 mph whilst under test on the main line. Its suspension had two vertical coil springs and two vertical and one lateral hydraulic damper at each corner of the vehicle. This was {{at a time when}} few freight trains travelled at more than forty mph and most passenger trains averaged about seventy mph. It supported theories of vehicle design which led to most later designs of train.|$|R
50|$|Other changes {{required}} cars not {{be allowed}} to race on, previously used, slicks (smooth tires), requiring <b>profiled</b> (<b>treaded</b> or grooved) tires. Also, the driver was required to sit more upright with a seating angle of, at most, 27 degrees.|$|R
40|$|Wheel treads {{are subject}} to {{different}} types of damage such as wear, rolling contact fatigue (RCF), thermal cracks, plastic deformation and also flats caused by wheel sliding. Some of these phenomena {{is followed by a}} change in <b>tread</b> <b>profile</b> which results in frequent wheel reprofiling to keep rich comfort of the vehicle. In this study, a series of full-scale tread braking experiments, including wheel-rail rolling contact, were conducted in order to clarify the influencing factors of evolution of wheel <b>tread</b> <b>profile.</b> The experiments focused on plastic deformation and wear caused by rolling contact and tread braking. The presented results show that the maximum tread depression is 0. 20 mm at the rolling contact center after 40 times stop braking actions. This is considered to be caused by plastic deformation of the wheel tread induced by high contact pressure and material softening due to high temperatures from tread braking. This result is supported by the observed protrusion of the tread near the rolling contact area and also by a difference of hardness between the rolling contact area and other tread area...|$|E
40|$|The online {{detection}} of wheelset size {{has important implications}} for ensuring the safety of railway operation and decreasing the maintenance costs. Based on laser displacement sensors (LDS), a novel online detection system of the wheel size is proposed using only six two-dimensional LDS and two one-dimensional LDS. The calculation principles of <b>tread</b> <b>profile</b> and wheel diameter are given, as well as the calibration method. Errors induced by wheel-rail vibration, misalignment, sensor noise, S-shape running, and wheelset differential are also analyzed. After system implementation, field experiments were performed using both standard wheel and several real trains. It turns out that the detection uncertainty of flange width and height is 0. 1 [*]mm and wheel diameter 0. 3 [*]mm, which can meet the requirements of maintenance...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{assesses the}} {{technical}} efficiency of different operators turning railway wheelsets on a under-floor wheel lathe. This type of lathe is a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine used to turn wheelsets in-situ on the train. As railway wheels are turned, {{a certain amount}} of the wheel diameter is lost to restore the <b>tread</b> <b>profile</b> and full flange thickness of the wheel. The technical efficiencies of the different wheel lathe operators are assessed using a Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), whilst controlling for other explaining variables such as the flange thickness and the occurrence of rolling contact fatigue (RCF) defects, wheel flats and cavities. Different model specifications for the SFA are compared with Linear Mixed Model (LMM) specifications, showing that the SFA model exhibits a better Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of rolling tyres with road surfaces {{is one of}} the major contributions to road traffic noise. The generation mechanisms of tyre/road noise are usually separated in structure borne and airborne noise. In both mechanisms the contact zone is important. In order to reduce tyre/road noise at the source, accurate (numerical) prediction models are needed. For accurate results, the tyre has to be modelled by a three-dimensional finite element model, accounting for complex rubber material behaviour, <b>tread</b> <b>profiles</b> and a detailed tyre construction. A dynamic analysis of a tyre in contact can then be carried out in the time domain. The Structural Dynamics and Acoustics group of the University of Twente has developed an alternative contact solver. The solver, in which the contact condition is always satisfied, is successfully applied to an implicit and explicit three-dimensional finite element model. As a consequence there is no need for contact elements or contact parameters. The finite element model is valid for large translations and rotations, in which different material models and friction models can be added. This paper explains the solver for an implicit and explicit scheme and presents some examples. In one of the examples a deformable rubber ring is modelled, which is rolling on a rigid surface at a slip angle. The results are compared to the finite element package Abaqus. The examples show the robustness and potential of the algorithm. ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{abnormal}} tread wear. Poor wheel alignment can cause excessive wear of the innermost or outermost ribs. Gravel roads, rocky terrain, and other rough terrain causes accelerated wear. Over-inflation above the sidewall maximum can cause excessive wear {{to the center of}} the tread. Modern tires have steel belts built in to prevent this. Under-inflation causes excessive wear to the outer ribs. Unbalanced wheels can cause uneven tire wear, as the rotation may not be perfectly circular. Tire manufacturers and car companies have mutually established standards for tread wear testing that include measurement parameters for <b>tread</b> loss <b>profile,</b> lug count, and heel-toe wear.

Also, the driver was required to sit more upright with a seating angle of, at most, 27 degrees. It finished second.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{modelling}} {{approach to}} predict the influence of road texture on the rolling resistance of car tyres is presented where the large static tyre deformations and the small texture induced tyre vibrations are treated separately. The energy dissipation due to the large continuous cyclic deformation of the tyre cross section for a treadless tyre subject to nominal load on a smooth road is determined in a non-linear steady-state rolling analysis on an FEM tyre model. The additional energy dissipation resulting from the contact forces and tyre vibrations due to the combined effect of the <b>tread</b> <b>profile</b> and the road texture, are determined based on a modal representation of the deformed tyre. The predicted rolling resistance coefficients are compared to experimental data. Although an offset in the absolute rolling resistance levels can be observed, the model predicts the correct trend regarding the increase of rolling resistance with increasing texture depth...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effects of}} gross rail load (GRL) {{on the performance of}} 36 -inch diameter freight car wheels in North American service. Association of American Railroads (AAR) Car Repair Billing (CRB) data are reviewed to show the types of wheel removals that typically occur in North American freight service. Historical trends in CRB data are noted, with emphasis on service-related wheel removals. The root causes of several wheel defects are briefly described. Wheel/rail contact stresses are reviewed for wheels with “ideal ” and “non-ideal ” <b>tread</b> <b>profile</b> conditions. Wheel/rail impact loads are discussed with particular emphasis on the possible negative effects of such loading on wheel failures such as shattered rims. Thermal loading of the wheel due to tread braking is considered and AAR S- 660 finite element analysis computer simulations are performed for four different 36 -inch one-wear wheel designs using 100 -ton and 125 -ton loading conditions. Finally, recent work relating the effects of drag braking to the level of residual compressive wheel rim hoop stress is reviewed. Throughout the paper recommendations are provided regarding practices that will benefit wheel safety and where the authors feel that additional industry research work will provide benefits...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{conduct a}} {{research}} and find out the causes of defects appearing on the wheel thread of freight locomotives 2 М 62 and SIEMENS ER 20 CF. Methodology. To find the ways {{to solve this problem}} comparing the locomotive designs and their operating conditions. Findings. After examining the nature of the wheel wear the main difference was found: in locomotives of the 2 M 62 line wears the wheel flange, and in the locomotives SIEMENS ER 20 CF – the tread surface. After installation on the 2 M 62 locomotive the lubrication system of flanges their wear rate significantly decreased. On the new freight locomotives SIEMENS ER 20 CF the flange lubrication systems of the wheel set have been already installed at the factory, however the wheel thread is wearing. As for locomotives 2 M 62, and on locomotives SIEMENS ER 20 CF most wear profile skating wheels of the first wheel set. On both locomotive lines the 2 М 62 and the SIEMENS ER 20 CF the <b>tread</b> <b>profile</b> of the first wheel set most of all is subject to the wear. After reaching the 170 000 km run, the tread surface of some wheels begins to crumble. There was a suspicion that the reason for crumb formation of the wheel surface may be insufficient or excessive wheel hardness or its chemical composition. In order to confirm or deny this suspicion the following studies were conducted: the examination of the rim surface, the study of the wheel metal hardness and the document analysis of the wheel production and their comparison with the results of wheel hardness measurement. Practical value. The technical condition of locomotives is one of the bases of safety and reliability of the rolling stock. The reduction of the wheel wear significantly reduces the operating costs of railway transport. After study completion it was found that there was no evidence to suggest that the ratio of the wheel-rail hardness could be the cause of the wheel surface crumbling...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} resolve the {{problems}} of conventional wheelset, many efforts have been made. For example, the semi-active and active actuation systems have been adopted to enhance the dynamic performance of railway vehicles [10, 11]. The independently rotating wheel (IRW) that decouples the wheelset is proposed to eliminate the hunting motion of the conventional wheelset and reduce the wheel/rail wear in sharp curves. The IRWs for railway vehicles have been investigated for many years. However, the use of IRW would also eliminate the guidance capability of the railway vehicles in large radius curves and tangent lines. Consequently, a compromise should be achieved between the curving performance in sharp curves and that in large radius curves and tangent lines by use of active controls like yaw control, creep control of damping, and stiff control. IRWs with <b>profiled</b> <b>tread,</b> with partial coupling, and with a superimposition gearbox have been proposed by Kaplan et al. [12], Dukkipati [13], and Jaschinski et al. [14], respectively. Gretashel and Bose [15] investigated the separate drive motors with precise torque control to provide guidance and curving capability. Goodall and co-workers [16, 17, 18] studied the active steering and optimized control strategy for IRWs.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that wheels are {{responsible}} for a significant amount of the total aerodynamic drag of passenger vehicles. Tyres, and mostly rims, {{have been the subject of}} research in the automotive industry for the past years, but their effect and interaction with each other and with the car exterior is still not completely understood. This paper focuses on the use of CFD to study the effects of tyre geometry (tyre <b>profile</b> and tyre <b>tread)</b> on road vehicle aerodynamics. Whenever possible, results of the numerical computations are compared with experiments. More than sixty configurations were simulated. These simulations combined different tyre <b>profiles,</b> <b>treads,</b> rim designs and spoke orientation on two car types: a sedan and a sports wagon. Two tyre geometries were obtained directly from the tyre manufacturer, while a third geometry was obtained from our database and represents a generic tyre which covers different profiles of a given tyre size. All geometries were deformed based on measured wind tunnel data under a defined load and rotating conditions of 100 kph. Results have shown that the main grooves consistently lead to a decrease of both drag and lift. The edge pattern however, did not show a clear trend for drag and lift with respect to the different configurations studied, although its influence was always more noticeable on the sports wagon. The larger profile of the generic tyre resulted in higher drag and lift values with relation to the tyres obtained from the manufacturer. For a given rim, a drag difference was observed between two tyre geometries with same profile but different tyre tread. These findings lead to the conclusion that tyre profile, as well as tyre pattern, are important to consider. These results were confirmed by wind tunnel tests. In conclusion, the work of aerodynamic optimization of rims cannot be separated from the tyre itself...|$|R
