5|$|Alcatraz cellhouse had a {{corridor}} naming system named after major American streets and landmarks. Michigan Avenue was <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> {{to the side}} of A-Block, and Broadway was the central corridor in which the inmates would assemble as they massed through Times Square (an area with a clock on the wall), before entering the dining hall for their meals. Broadway separated Block-B and Block-C and prisoners kept along it had the least privacy in the prison. <b>The</b> <b>corridor</b> between Block-C and the library was called Park Avenue. <b>The</b> <b>corridor</b> in D-Block was named Sunset Strip. Gun galleries lay {{at the end of each}} block, including the West and East Gun Galleries.|$|E

50|$|This mystery {{deals with}} {{the future and the}} past. The magi of Time, known as Diviners, also created <b>the</b> <b>Corridors,</b> holes in time and space that take a person from one place to another. <b>The</b> <b>Corridors</b> became <b>the</b> main form of {{transportation}} for all magi. When the Diviners were wiped out during the Iron Wars, <b>the</b> <b>Corridors</b> were maintained by the Kan-hanar s Life while the church took control of the use of <b>the</b> <b>Corridors.</b> It is stated in Darksword Adventures that for a person to be a Diviner, one parent must also be a Diviner.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> public <b>corridors</b> are {{generally}} L-shaped {{except on the}} fourth floor where <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> extend around <b>the</b> perimeter of the outside wall. Originally <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> had terrazzo floors with 8" [...] pink marble borders, plaster ceiling and walls with marble base. <b>The</b> original <b>corridor</b> doors were hollow metal surrounded by metal trim. Many original finishes still exist. The elevator lobbies have the same terrazzo floors with painted plaster walls and ceiling. The elevator doors are framed by Appalachian Golden Vein marble, with the same marble comprising the base at the wall.|$|R
5|$|Behind {{the granite}} barrier <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> {{branches}} eastward to a T-shaped magazine chamber which probably contained Userkaf's funerary equipment.

5|$|The roads {{now making}} up the highway were {{originally}} part of several privately maintained turnpikes, which fostered settlements along <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> Once part of the former NY58, it has been NY32 since 1930. Only one of three letter-suffixed spur routes remains.|$|E

5|$|Actual {{planning}} for I-359 commenced in 1961, and by 1971, the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) announced that federal funding would be sought for its construction. Planning for <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> continued throughout the 1970s, only to stall briefly due to complications with the required {{environmental impact assessment}} associated with the project. By 1976, it was announced I-359 would have an exit both at 35th Street and 15th Street to improve access to both the University of Alabama and Stillman College.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the NTSB {{recommended}} that ATC controllers and supervisors be briefed {{in the circumstances}} of this accident; that a Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA) be established for the location requiring special training for pilots transiting the area; and that helicopters be required to operate at lower altitudes than airplanes in <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> to minimize the speed differences.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the late 1950s, plans for a Tulsa freeway system {{included}} a route along 96th Street South. The 96th Street corridor was accessible to more motorists than other corridors further south (farther away from the urban core), while still having low right-of-way costs, comparable to more southerly corridors. This made it the ideal route for a south Tulsa freeway. In 1986, ODOT had {{plans to build a}} toll-free facility called the Creek Freeway in <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> as part of SH-117.|$|E

5|$|Bacliff, like San Leon, and Bayview, {{originated}} as {{a fishing}} community. In 2012 T.J.

Like San Leon and Bayview, many residents in Bacliff commute to work in Houston.|$|E
5|$|By mid-2012, {{the merits}} of the ten routes had been considered, {{including}} the economic, environmental and technical issues involved, and a broad outline of <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> for the link was scheduled to be published in September. After that, consultation with landowners and stakeholders took place, to establish the final route, for which design of the channel and the associated locks, bridges, moorings and pumping stations could then begin.|$|E

50|$|The {{first six}} {{floors of the}} E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse were similar in plan. Four {{elevators}} opened into a small lobby that accessed the main, double-loaded east-west <b>corridor.</b> <b>The</b> main hallway traveled nearly the entire width {{of the building and}} intersected secondary corridors at each end. <b>The</b> secondary <b>corridors,</b> which traveled north-south, provided access to the office spaces. On floors two- four, five, and six, <b>the</b> secondary <b>corridors</b> also connected to guarded entrances, which controlled access to private judge's <b>corridors.</b> <b>The</b> length of <b>the</b> secondary <b>corridors</b> varied by floor. Courtrooms, however, appeared in set locations. Floors two and four each held seven courtrooms. The north side of <b>the</b> main <b>corridors</b> on each floor accessed six courtrooms, while the seventh was accessed from the south side of <b>the</b> <b>corridors.</b> <b>The</b> sixth floor followed an identical arrangement, but held only six courtrooms. The ceremonial courtroom occupied the space of two typical courtrooms.|$|R

5|$|Didsbury {{is served}} by several bus routes into Manchester city centre, The Trafford Centre, Northenden, and other destinations. Wilmslow Road {{provides}} Didsbury with a regular bus service due to the strong demand for travel by students along <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> The service is cheap and passengers rarely have to wait {{more than a couple}} of minutes. According to some analysts, Wilmslow Road is the busiest bus corridor in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Except for the Q53, all buses along <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> end {{northbound}} {{service at}} Queens and Woodhaven Boulevards, at the Woodhaven Boulevard subway station of the IND Queens Boulevard Line {{and at the}} foot of Queens Center mall. Buses reenter service in a dedicated bus stop area on Hoffman Drive adjacent to the south side of Queens Boulevard. The Q53 serves these stops on its through service to or from Woodside.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, {{the house}} had 16 {{bathrooms}} and 65 rooms, including 20 for servants. The house's main door opens into a square vaulted vestibule, walled throughout with highly polished yellow marble. It leads into the main hall, which is paneled to the ceiling in wood, painted white, the corners and angles accentuated by pilasters, and the rich mahogany doors encased within monumental frames. The white ceiling is intricately coffered. The hall has a large fireplace of carved white marble and a large table in the room's center, which was on a large red rug covering most of the floor. The main hall also featured Gobelins and Italian tapestries. The first floor also has an enfilade of three rooms: the green silk- and cedar-paneled living room, the white and gold drawing room, and the dark mahogany dining room. The three rooms have large doorways between them to allow hosts to combine rooms for a large event. The combined space has a span or linear distance of about 150 feet. A corridor connects the main hall to three rooms; it has recessed windows, dividing <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> into bays. <b>The</b> <b>corridor</b> has pilasters and the same coffered ceiling of the main hall, and it used to have heavy velvet curtains at the window alcoves and entrance to the hallway; the windows had curtains of delicate salmon silk. <b>The</b> <b>corridor</b> originally displayed silk and velvet tapestries from {{various parts of the}} world.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, Raytheon Engineers and Constructors {{proposed}} {{to build and}} operate a Dulles Corridor Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. In January 1999, the Tysons-Dulles Corridor Group (which included Bechtel Corporation and West*Group) offered a competing BRT proposal that would ultimately extend the rail line to Ashburn. These proposals prompted the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) to evaluate the merits of BRT and heavy rail public transit in <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b>|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, state {{officials}} {{released a report}} detailing possible sites for an infill station in East Lyme.
