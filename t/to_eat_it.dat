5|$|A {{member of}} the genus Latrodectus in the family Theridiidae, the redback belongs in a clade with the black widow spider, with the katipo as its closest relative. A 2004 {{molecular}} study supports the redback's status as a distinct species, as does the unique abdomen-presenting behaviour of the male during mating. The close {{relationship between the two}} species is shown when mating: the male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo is too heavy to mate with the female redback, as it triggers a predatory response in the female when it approaches the web, causing the female <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it.</b> There is evidence of interbreeding between female katipo and male redbacks in the wild.|$|E

5|$|During a {{fundraising}} {{event in}} Russellville, Arkansas, Brightspirit's Mercy {{was performed by}} various high school drama students. The second of two plays by Erin Hunter, Brightspirit's Mercy is about Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf. After going to a Gathering, where it is obvious all of the Clans except for ThunderClan are starving, three cats from StarClan appear to them: Brightspirit and her parents, Shiningheart and Braveheart, characters created on Wands and Worlds, a fantasy fiction forum, in memory of a 10-year-old Warriors fan, Emmy Grace Cherry, and her parents, Dana and Jimmy Cherry, {{who were killed in}} a tornado in February 2007. They tell the three young cats that they must help feed the other Clans. Jaypaw is easily convinced, but Hollyleaf and Lionblaze are harder to win over. Eventually, they agree and hunt, then wait at the WindClan border for a patrol. Ashfoot, WindClan's deputy, accepts the gift, but Breezepaw, too proud to have help from another Clan, refuses <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it.</b> Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf then head towards another Clan's territory.|$|E
5|$|Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; {{angelfish}} and zebras are striped. These patterns have {{an evolutionary}} explanation: they have functions which {{increase the chances}} that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is camouflage; for instance, a leopard that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is signalling — for instance, a ladybird {{is less likely to}} be attacked by predatory birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also distastefully bitter or poisonous, or mimics other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it,</b> but it will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting genes that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.|$|E

25|$|They spin a tubular web, {{often in}} cracks of buildings. Six or more silken lines radiate from it, and the spider waits in the entrance, {{touching}} the lines with the frontal six legs. Prey triggering these lines get caught, and the spider immediately retreats again <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it.</b> However, {{in some cases}} the spider will kill and begin to consume its prey in the opening of the tube, but will retreat further if disturbed. They hunt nocturnal insects such as moths and cockroaches. Bees and wasps are always bitten at the head end, so the sting will face away from the spider.|$|E
25|$|Across {{the top of}} the {{trapping}} pit was a thick stick or pole, and on {{this was}} fastened a plank, which covered {{the top of the}} trap. On one end of this plank was a piece of venison, and on the other a stone. The way the trap was meant to work was this: The wolf would come to the venison, and just as it got on the plank <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it,</b> the plank would turn, causing the wolf to fall into the pit. The weight of the stone at the other end would bring the plank up again, ready baited for another wolf.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem with}} the thinkings of Rawls {{is that it is}} overly {{procedural}} as found in defenders of natural law.

For example, if two people are found to own an orange, the standard fair procedure is to cut it in two and give half to each. However, if one wants <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> while the other wants the rind to flavor a cake, cutting it in two is clearly less good than giving the peel to the baker and feeding the core to the eater.|$|E

25|$|According to Leviticus, {{anyone who}} comes {{into contact with}} or carries any {{creature}} that hadn't been deliberately killed by shechita was regarded by the biblical regulations as having made themselves unclean by doing so, and therefore was compelled to immerse their entire body. This regulation is immediately preceded by the rule against eating anything still containing blood, and according to biblical scholars {{this is also the}} context of the regulation about not eating non-sacrifices - that the regulation only treats such consumption as unclean if there is a risk of blood still remaining within the carcass. In the version of this regulation in Deuteronomy, eating the bodies of such creatures isn't described as making an individual ritually impure, nor requires the eater to wash their body, but instead such consumption is expressly forbidden, although the creature is allowed to be passed on to a stranger, who is permitted <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} grains in Poland were millet (often made into kasza, {{a type of}} porridge) and wheat. Barley and oats were cultivated, but used mostly as animal feed or for brewing beer. Cabbage (especially as sauerkraut), kale, peas, broad beans, and onions were the most common vegetables. Dill and mustard were almost {{ubiquitous}} potherbs and parsley {{was used as a}} leafy green in stews, as a flavor additive, and applied as a coloring agent in dishes for the upper classes. Beef, pork and poultry (primarily chicken) were the most common meats, with the occasional appearance of mutton and lamb. Game, as elsewhere, was highly prized, but in short supply and usually limited to the high nobility, as hunting licenses were controlled by land owners. Fish was a staple, but unlike Germans, Poles tended only <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> on fast days when meat was forbidden by the church.|$|E

Over time, Marlene Olive also developed resentment toward her father for siding with her mother in disputes and suspected him of informing police about her friends' drug activities. She shoplifted, stole her parents' credit cards, used and overdosed on drugs, ran away from home, and received stolen goods from burglaries committed by a boyfriend. She talked to several friends about wanting to kill her parents and asked {{some of them to}} help, but the friends either did not take her seriously or decided not to get involved.

25|$|Using these variables, {{the optimal}} diet model can predict how predators choose between two prey types: big prey1 with energy value E1 and {{handling}} time h1, and small prey2 with energy value E2 and handling time h2. In order to maximize its overall rate of energy gain, a predator {{must consider the}} profitability of the two prey types. If {{it is assumed that}} big prey1 is more profitable than small prey2, then E1/h1 > E2/h2. Thus, if the predator encounters prey1, it should always choose <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it,</b> because of its higher profitability. It should never bother to go searching for prey2. However, if the animal encounters prey2, it should reject it to look for a more profitable prey1, unless the time it would take to find prey1 is too long and costly for it to be worth it. Thus, the animal should only eat prey2 if E2/h2 > E1/(h1+S1), where S1 is the search time for prey1. Since it is always favorable to choose to eat prey1, the choice to eat prey1 is not dependent on the abundance of prey2. But since the length of S1 (i.e. {{how difficult it is to}} find prey1) is logically dependent on the density of prey1, the choice to eat prey2 is dependent on the abundance of prey1.|$|E

After intervention by the Captain, the crew were provided with a breakfast that satisfied them.
