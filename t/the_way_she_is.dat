2500|$|Christina Roberts of Culturess felt Slingshot was [...] "a cool premise for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to do.

Honestly, I would have loved if {{this was just a}} standalone episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., too. While the ongoing storylines and plot threads are fun, an episode that can stand on its own is always a nice breath of fresh air... It will be fun to see if any of this carries over into the rest of the show when it returns, even if it’s just a wink and a nod between Daisy and Elena." [...] Geek Exchange's Georgia Ringelberg felt, [...] "Overall, the digital series is unnecessary because the plot doesn’t add anything to the larger series as we await the second half of season 4. But it is enjoyable to watch with quite a few nice nods to {{the first half of the}} season... It’s a fun, quick watch that’s perfect for getting through the mid-season break and hopefully gets Yo-Yo/Slingshot some well-deserved attention." [...] Additionally, Ringelberg felt the use of Rodriguez in the series would lead [...] "to more screen time for Yo-Yo and maybe even preparing viewers for the Inhumans series... If they transition her to Inhumans or give her time on both shows, she could be strategically utilized instead of mostly forgotten <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> now." ...|$|E
