These are more reliable than A-clamps because the O-ring is well protected, but many countries do not use DIN fittings widely on compressors, or cylinders which have DIN fittings, so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system may need to take an adaptor, either for connecting the DIN regulator to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder valve.|$|R
5000|$|Four {{injection}} molded {{semi-rigid plastic}} pieces constitute the circa 6 in tall figure which features printed accents on the dress and hand-painted details on hands, face and neck, hair, sunglasses, microphone and inserts in the trouser legs. Molded as one piece, {{the upper body}} of the figure including a static head is the most prominent part. The right arm with hand and microphone is also molded as one piece and attached to the upper body piece at the right shoulder by a snap-in joint with a square connector which keeps the right arm of the figure in a static position relative to the upper body piece. The lower body piece consists of the pelvic area and both legs molded as one piece. At the waist of the figure, {{the upper and lower}} body pieces are connected to each other by a flexible metal spring joint, as are the left arm piece and the upper body piece at the left shoulder. Both threaded connectors of the spring joint at the left shoulder of the figure are recessed, hiding the spring mechanism of the joint.

40|$|<b>Threaded</b> <b>connectors</b> {{have been}} used in a variety of {{engineering}} structures for hundreds of years. Although stress analysis of <b>threaded</b> <b>connectors</b> has been performed since the early 1900 's, there are still areas that are not fully understood. The way in which eccentricity affects the fatigue performance and stress distribution is one such area, and is the main area of research described in this thesis. The techniques of photoelasticity and fatigue testing were used to determine the effect of eccentricity on the stresses and fatigue performance of bolts. The results show that eccentric loading has a significant effect on the fatigue performance, but that this effect can be quantified if the local stress amplitude is considered. The photoelastic analysis results show the eccentricity slightly increases the stress intensity factors at the crack tip. A number of two-dimensional and three-dimensional finite element models were created to detennine the salient characteristics of the models. The models were validated against the resuh from the photoelastic analysis and the results agreed well. Accurate results can be obtained from a two-dimensional model, but the information obtained is limited unless many models are created. However, if a three-dimensional model is created more information can be obtained, but the nut thread run-out must be accurately modelled to obtain the correct stress distribution. The shape of cracks occurring in cyclically loaded steel bolts and the effect of crack shape on the stress distribution was also investigated. The photoelastic analysis of cracked bolts failed to predict the shapes of cracks occurring in cyclically loaded bolts. It is suggested that the inability of photoelasticity to model plasticity is the cause of this failure and this is supported by results from an elastic-plastic finite element model...|$|R
5000|$|An annular-type blowout {{preventer}} can close around the drill string, casing or a non-cylindrical object, {{such as the}} kelly. Drill pipe including the larger-diameter tool joints (<b>threaded</b> <b>connectors)</b> can be [...] "stripped" [...] (i.e., moved vertically while pressure is contained below) through an annular preventer by careful control of the hydraulic closing pressure. Annular {{blowout preventer}}s are also effective at maintaining a seal around the drillpipe even as it rotates during drilling. Regulations typically require that an annular preventer be able to completely close a wellbore, but annular preventers are generally not as effective as ram preventers in maintaining a seal on an open hole. Annular BOPs are typically located {{at the top of}} a BOP stack, with one or two annular preventers positioned above a series of several ram preventers.|$|R

50|$|The cams {{at the end}} of each lever on {{the female}} end align with a {{circumferential}} groove on the male end. When the levers are rotated to the locked position, they pull the male end into the female socket, creating a tight seal up against a gasket. The arms lock into position using an over-center arrangement, preventing accidental decoupling. Because the groove is cut all the way around the male end, there is no specific alignment necessary to couple as there would be with <b>threaded</b> <b>connectors,</b> and there is no opportunity for cross-threading. This results in an error-resistant, faster coupling operation. Because the compression between the two fittings is limited by the size of the cams on the end of the levers and the rotation of the levers themselves, there is also no possibility of over- or under-tightening the fitting; the pressure against the sealing gasket is effectively constant from one coupling operation to the next, reducing possibility of leaks.|$|R

40|$|The {{finite element}} models of contact {{problems}} about connectors of buttress and round threads of casing were established with the elasto-plastic FEM of ANSYS software. Under the three flank angles 30, 50 and 100 for the buttress casing connector, the curves that the jump-out loads varied with the loading process were obtained. With the three tapers 1 / 14, 1 / 16 and 1 / 17, for the round casing connector, the curves that the jump-out loads varied with the loading process were obtained. At the same time, the jump-out process of the buttress and round <b>thread</b> <b>connectors</b> was studied, respectively. The average jump-out force of the buttress connector is 594. 1 ton, and however, the average jump-out force of the round connector is 342. 5 ton. That is to say, under the same casing and the same casing size, the connector of the buttress thread {{is not so easy}} to jump out, but the connector of the round thread is very easy to jump out. It provides the theoretical supports for the selection of the casing connectors in the extra-deep well and complex well...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to adopt the Johansen‚Äôs {{yielding}} theory as a possibility to predict the ultimate load for timber-to-concrete joints using self-tapping <b>threaded</b> <b>connectors</b> screwed at an angle into the wood. The ultimate loadbearing capacity of a single connector is predicted to be when either the stresses in the wood reach the plastic failure stress level or when a combination of plastic failure in wood and dowel is attained. K. W. Johansen assumed that no axial tension occurred in the dowel and, thus no frictional contribution affected the lateral load-bearing capacity. However, the joints with inclined fasteners are first affected by tension load, so the withdrawal capacity of the screws has to be taken into account. In order to determine the load bearing capacity for specific connector geometry, the kinematical possible failure modes are determined. The screw in the concrete part of connection was taken as rigidly embedded and thus no deformations appeared. The study showed that the load-bearing capacity for connections with inclined high tensile strength screws can be predicted using the yielding theory, but this theory was unable to predict precisely the failure mode. Possible reasons for that include limited fastener ductility and influence of the screw inclination on the strength properties of timber...|$|R

40|$|Petri-nets {{have been}} used to model and analyze {{business}} process behavior, both in pure form and as the semantics of visual formalisms. We and others have advocated the use of a restricted class of nets called free-choice nets.

This paper shows that constructs used in most business process languages lead to free-choice nets, but there are behaviors that cannot be modeled using these constructs, like the cancellation of an activity.

40|$|Graphite {{electrodes}} used in steelmaking {{are joined}} together by <b>threaded,</b> tapered <b>connectors</b> (nipples) of similar material. The jointed regions {{are subjected to}} arduous thermal and mechanical stresses during use. Mechanical stresses arise from electrode self-weight and tightening torque, and the thermal stresses from the high furnace operating temperatures which ensure a high radiative surface cooling rate as the electrode {{is removed from the}} furnace. This thermal shock effect is thought to contribute to particular types of electrode failure. In this computer-aided analysis of the stresses induced by the above effects, a commercial finite element program is used in conjunction with a purpose-written finite difference program. Mechanical loads due to electrode self-weight and pretightening torque are evaluated and applied with suitable restraints to an axisymmetric finite element mesh, to obtain a mechanical stress analysis. The finite difference program is then used to calculate the time-variant temperature field experienced by an electrode on being removed from the furnace. An interpolation program is used to assign temperatures at the nodes of the same finite element mesh, the thermal stresses then being evaluated by the commercial finite element program. A 'failure envelope' analysis of the results identifies the critically-stressed regions of the joint and shows that in some such areas the thermal-shock stresses act to relieve the mechanically-induced stresses. A statistical analysis based on Weibull theory predicts a high incidence of crack formation due to thermal stresses. Finally, consideration is given to the effect of thermal orthotropy and temperature-dependent material properties...|$|R
40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{mission to}} expand space {{exploration}} will return humans to the Moon {{with the goal}} of maintaining a long-term presence. One challenge that NASA will face returning to the Moon is managing the lunar regolith found on the Moon's surface, which will collect on extravehicular activity (EVA) suits and other equipment. Based on the Apollo experience, the issues astronauts encountered with lunar regolith included eye/lung irritation, and various hardware failures (seals, screw <b>threads,</b> electrical <b>connectors</b> and fabric contamination), which were all related to inadequate lunar regolith mitigation. A vacuum cleaner capable of detaching, transferring, and efficiently capturing lunar regolith has been proposed as a method to mitigate the lunar regolith problem in the habitable environment on lunar surface. In order to develop this vacuum, a modified "off-the-shelf' vacuum cleaner will be used to determine detachment efficiency, vacuum requirements, and optimal cleaning techniques to ensure efficient dust removal in habitable lunar surfaces, EVA spacesuits, and air exchange volume. During the initial development of the Lunar Surface System vacuum cleaner, systematic testing was performed with varying flow rates on multiple surfaces (fabrics and metallics), atmospheric (14. 7 psia) and reduced pressures (10. 2 and 8. 3 psia), different vacuum tool attachments, and several vacuum cleaning techniques {{in order to determine the}} performance requirements for the vacuum cleaner. The data recorded during testing was evaluated by calculating particulate removal, relative to the retained simulant on the tested surface. In addition, optical microscopy was used to determine particle size distribution retained on the surface. The scope of this paper is to explain the initial phase of vacuum cleaner development, including historical Apollo mission data, current state-of-the-art vacuum cleaner technology, and vacuum cleaner testing that has focused on detachment capabilities at varying pressure environments...|$|R
40|$|A tool {{makes it}} {{possible}} to couple a torque wrench to an externally knurled, internally <b>threaded,</b> round cable <b>connector.</b> The purpose served by the tool is to facilitate the tightening of multiple such connectors (or the repeated tightening of the same connector) to repeatable torques. The design of a prior cable-connector/ torque-wrench coupling tool provided for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location laterally offset from the axis of rotation of the cable connector, making it necessary to correct the torque reading for the offset. Unlike the design of the prior tool, the design of the present tool provides for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location on the axis of rotation, obviating correction of the torque reading for offset. The present tool (see figure) consists of a split collet containing a slot that provides clearance for inserting and bending the cable, a collet-locking sleeve, a collet-locking nut, and a torque-wrench adaptor that is press-fit onto the collet. Once the collet is positioned on the cable connector, the collet-locking nut is turned to force the collet-locking sleeve over the collet, compressing the collet through engagement of tapered surfaces {{on the outside of the}} collet and the inside of the locking sleeve. Because the collet is split and therefore somewhat flexible, this compression forces the collet inward to grip the connector securely. The torque wrench is then applied to the torque-wrench adaptor in the usual manner for torquing a nut or a bolt...|$|R
