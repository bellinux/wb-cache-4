25|$|RAF West Drayton was a non-flying Royal Air Force {{station in}} West Drayton, within the London Borough of Hillingdon, {{which served as}} the main centre for {{military}} air traffic control in the United Kingdom. It was co-located with the civilian London <b>Terminal</b> <b>Control</b> Centre to provide a vital link between civil and military flying and airspace requirements. Following {{the departure of the}} remaining civil and military air traffic control systems by 2008, the site was closed and demolished for a new residential development.|$|E

25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{investigation}} {{found that the}} Piper had entered the Los Angeles <b>Terminal</b> <b>Control</b> Area airspace without the required clearance. The TCA included a triangular slab of airspace from 6000ft to 7000ft altitude reaching south to 33.714N 118.007W, across the Piper's intended flight path; the Piper could legally fly beneath this airspace without contacting air traffic controllers, but instead climbed into the TCA. The air traffic controller had been distracted by another unauthorized private flight – a Grumman AA-5 Tiger – entering the TCA directly north of the airfield, that also did not have clearance.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Air Force withdrew in 1994, {{at which}} point the English Electric Lightning acting as a gate {{guardian}} was scrapped; only the nose section was retained and sent to the Malta Aviation Museum. Air traffic control services remained, although the section responsible for airspace outside London moved to Swanwick in Hampshire in 2002. The remaining operation was named the London <b>Terminal</b> <b>Control</b> Centre. RAF personnel remained on the site, as military air traffic control functions for the eastern side of England remained. In November 2007, the remaining civil air traffic control services moved to Swanwick, and in January 2008 the military operation also left the site. National Air Traffic Services vacated the site in 2008. The MT section of the Queen's Colour Squadron relocated to RAF Northolt.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, a {{graduate}} student in the computer science department named Bill Joy (MS 1982) assembled the original Berkeley Software Distribution, commonly known as BSD Unix. Joy, who went on to co-found Sun Microsystems, also developed the original version of the terminal console editor vi, while Ken Arnold (BA 1985) created Curses, a <b>terminal</b> <b>control</b> library for Unix-like systems that enables the construction of text user interface (TUI) applications. Working alongside Joy at Berkeley were undergraduates William Jolitz (BS 1997) and his future wife Lynne Jolitz (BA 1989), who together created 386BSD, a version of BSD Unix that runs on Intel CPUs and evolved into the BSD family of free operating systems and the Darwin operating system underlying Apple Mac OS X. Eric Allman (BS 1977, MS 1980) created SendMail, a Unix mail transfer agent that delivers about 12% of the email in the world.|$|E

25|$|The {{airport at}} Santa Maria {{was part of}} a larger complex of {{buildings}} and infrastructures constructed in the 20th century. Apart of the airport terminals and ground control facilities, the area later known as Aeroporto locally, included a residential barrio, the services and equipment to support local residences, roadways and many of first signals, public transport stops and electrical transformer stations. The development of this district was important in the development of the island, with many of the installations left by American troops after the Second World War (the early <b>terminal,</b> <b>control</b> tower, building of Clube Asas do Atlântico, gymnasium, cinemas and warehouses) and many of the semi-cylindrical troop-quarters retained after the withdraw of forces. Its North American influence and original purpose marks its differences to local construction; the urban design and buildings, just like many of the projected constructions by architect Keil do Amaral (the airport, residence of airport director, groups of residences and signalling) make the district distinct from the other areas of the island. The newer neighborhoods and recent buildings, are of an inferior architectural quality, and correspond to the blocks closer to the airport.|$|E
2500|$|The Kalamazoo Airport's 1958 {{terminal}} had two jetways and {{housed the}} air traffic control tower. A Non-Radar Approach Control, located in Battle Creek and servicing Kalamazoo, was Commissioned in 1969. The air traffic control tower provides ATC services between the hours of 6:00–23:00 local time. When the control tower is operational, the airport lies within FAA Class [...] "D" [...] airspace. When the approach control is operational pilots may elect to receive radar services associated within a Terminal Radar Service Area (TRSA). The <b>Terminal</b> <b>Control</b> Center (TRACON) facility was not established until 1975, and radar was not installed until 1978.|$|E

50|$|A {{transistor}} is a {{semiconductor device}} used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power.

A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's <b>terminals</b> <b>controls</b> the current through another pair of <b>terminals.</b> Because the <b>controlled</b> (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal.

30|$|In AC grids, {{flexible}} AC {{transmission system}} (FACTS) devices are employed to support power flow control. In MTDC grids, the system state is different, since DC bus voltages are only characterized by their amplitude, {{and not by}} their phase-angle, and the transmission line impedances do not present any imaginary component in steady-state at zero frequency. Therefore, the only magnitudes {{to be used for}} controlling power flow in MTDC grids are the voltage and current amplitudes. In point-to-point HVDC transmission systems, power flow control is typically arranged with one <b>terminal</b> <b>controlling</b> the dc-link voltage, while the other <b>terminal</b> <b>controls</b> the active power, i.e., the current flowing through the HVDC transmission line. Although this simple control philosophy could be extended to MTDC grids, this is neither an optimal nor a flexible control solution for modern power systems. Thus, in order to fulfill requirements of tomorrow’s networks—with improved performance, reliability, and safety, future MTDC grids need to integrate other devices able to make power flow control flexible [31, 32].|$|R
