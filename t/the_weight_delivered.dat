40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} smoothing real-time streams (such as video streams), where {{the goal is to}} reproduce a variablebandwidth stream remotely, while minimizing bandwidth cost, space overhead, and playback delay. We focus on lossy schedules, where some bytes may be dropped due to limited bandwidth or space. We present the following results. First, we determine the optimal tradeoff between buffer space, queuing delay, and link bandwidth for lossy smoothing schedules. Specifically, this means that if one of these parameters is under our control, we can precisely calculate the optimal value which minimizes data loss while avoiding resource wastage. The tradeoff is accomplished by a simple generic algorithm, that allows one some freedom in choosing which data to discard. This algorithm is very easy to implement both at the server and at the client, and it enjoys the nice property that only the server decides which data to discard, and the client needs only to reconstruct the stream. In a second set of results we study the case where different parts of the data have different importance, modeled by assigning a real “weight ” to each byte in the stream. For this setting we use competitive analysis, i. e., we compare <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>delivered</b> by on-line algorithms to the weight of an optimal off-line schedule using the same resources. We prove that a natural greedy algorithm is 4 -competitive. We also prove a lower bound of 1. 25 on the competitive ratio of any deterministic on-line algorithm. Finally, we give a few experimental results which show that smoothing is extremely effective in practice, and that the greedy algorithm performs very well in the weighted case...|$|E
40|$|The rate {{at which}} {{subsystem}} weights grow with vehicle gross weight is assessed and is shown to be critical to the efficiency of large Earth to orbit transports. The overall trend, however, is {{a reduction in the}} inerts as a percentage of gross <b>weight</b> as <b>the</b> vehicle size is increased. For this reason, the larger the vehicle, the greater <b>the</b> payload <b>weight</b> <b>delivered</b> per pound of vehicle manufactured. Other critical issues addressed include the effects of wing loading and wing size on wing <b>weight,</b> <b>the</b> effect of entry planform loading on thermal protection system <b>weight,</b> <b>the</b> impact of power demand on cooling system and prime power weight, and tank fineness ratio on insulation <b>weight.</b> <b>The</b> effects of body shape and various internal packaging arrangements on weight and balance are also discussed. The greatest impact on overall vehicle weight is body shape and internal packaging, and could account for weight savings of up to 30 percent in body structure. Other subsystems are important, but the savings are much smaller in relation to overall vehicle weight [...] individually less than one percent...|$|R

30|$|Closer {{inspection}} {{shows that}} the failure to reproduce the results of Abadie et al. (2015) is not due to software problems, but stems from the newly introduced cross-validation technique. In fact, all the above mentioned predictor <b>weights</b> <b>deliver</b> identical values for the cross-validation criterion, thus they are all equivalent solutions of the cross-validation approach. Hence, the cross-validation technique is (in most applications) not well-defined, since <b>the</b> predictor <b>weights</b> are not uniquely defined. As the cross-validation technique allows many different equivalent predictor <b>weights,</b> <b>the</b> results obtained by Abadie et al. (2015) are arbitrary {{in the sense that}} the authors could have obtained different results if they had used other software or organized the data differently.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} to use {{realised}} kernels to carry out efficient feasible inference on the ex-post variation of underlying equity prices {{in the presence of}} simple models of market frictions. The issue is subtle with only estimators which have symmetric <b>weights</b> <b>delivering</b> consistent estimators with mixed Gaussian limit theorems. <b>The</b> <b>weights</b> can be chosen to achieve the best possible rate of convergence and to have an asymptotic variance which is close to that of the maximum likelihood estimator in the parametric version of this problem. Realised kernels can also be selected to (i) be analysed using endogenously spaced data such as that in databases on transactions, (ii) allow for market frictions which are endogenous, (iii) allow for temporally dependent noise. The finite sample performance of our estimators is studied using simulation, while empirical work illustrates their use in practice. ...|$|R
40|$|A small {{occasional}} fishery for whelk in {{the southern}} Irish Sea expanded in the early 1990 s, particularly in 1993, to provide meat for the Far East. Between 1990 and 1993 <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of whelk <b>delivered</b> by a fisherman to factory per day remained stable but the fishing effort increased by 44 %. The quality of landings declined, increasing proportions of smaller whelk being retained. The most heavily fished populations apparently display a Lee effect. An age at length key was prepared from 3, 081 individuals and is used to transform length to age frequencies within the area of interest. <b>The</b> <b>weight</b> compositions of graded samples, abstracted from processors' financial accounts, were converted to population numbers. The age of full recruitment is reckoned to be five years over the area of interest although it may fall to four in the most intensely fished whelk patches. A Thompson-Bell yield per recruit curve has Fmax at F= 0. 3. Only one fishery, at the northern fringes of the fishing area, has an F value (read from the catch curve) of less than this. F values of fisheries at the centre {{and south of the}} exploited area are all situated on the negative slope of the yield per recruit curve. Male maturation occurs at a length of 70 - 80 mm in the least and 50 mm in the most exploited populations. Thus, a measure to protect broodstock would require a size limit of approximately 70 - 80 mm which would, coincidentally, approximate the size for maximum sustainable yield. It would also have a catastrophic effect on the existing fisheries. A size limit of 50 mm is already in force...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the extent to which {{principals}} and school nutrition programme coordinators (nutrition coordinators) manage the responsibility of ensuring that the nutrition programme is implemented at their schools without interfering with the process of teaching and learning. The study includes a literature review and an empirical investigation. The specific knowledge gained from this research may add to the body of knowledge in the field of Education Management and should inform educators, principals, policy makers and individuals concerned with the management of school nutrition programmes on strategies that could be applied in managing the primary school nutrition programme. The data was collected by administering semi-structured interviews and observations. Five public primary school principals and five coordinators from Tembisa on the eastern outskirts of Johannesburg (Gauteng, South Africa) were interviewed. The results showed that the majority of principals and coordinators admitted that the programme enhanced learners’ performance at school, but felt that there were specific challenges in managing the programme. Some of the principals and coordinators experienced the programme as an additional burden to the educators who were already overloaded with curriculum lessons. Most of the schools indicated that feeding time sometimes overlapped with the learners’ class time, due to the large number of learners being served by one food handler. This study recommends that the SGB should reconsider the installation of food preparation facilities at schools. Other mechanisms should be sought to relieve the already overburdened educators from running the programme. Measuring scales should be available at all schools to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of <b>delivered</b> food items agree with the kilograms stated on the delivery invoice. The Department of Education should involve experts when planning the menu to warrant better nutritional value and effective delivery of the school nutrition programme. Regular seminars and workshops should be arranged for food suppliers, programme committee members and food handlers to ensure effective management and implementation of the programme.
