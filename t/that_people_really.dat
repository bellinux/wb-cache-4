25|$|The word utility {{is used to}} mean general {{well-being}} or happiness, and Mill's view is that utility is {{the consequence}} of a good action. Utility, {{within the context of}} utilitarianism, refers to people performing actions for social utility. With social utility, he means the well-being of many people. Mill's explanation of the concept of utility in his work, Utilitarianism, is <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>really</b> do desire happiness, and since each individual desires their own happiness, it must follow that all of us desire the happiness of everyone, contributing to a larger social utility. Thus, an action that results in the greatest pleasure for the utility of society is the best action, or as Jeremy Bentham, the founder of early Utilitarianism put it, as the greatest happiness of the greatest number.|$|E
500|$|On his {{reliance}} on PayPal donations, Adams {{says he is}} content since he feels <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>really</b> like his work or they would not pay. Adams said that donations remain stable except during a new version update, {{where there is a}} sudden increase. Their expenses being low, he has maintained that he is happy as long as the game is self-sustaining and will not charge for it. In 2011, Adams refused a job offer from an unspecified major game developer and a $300,000 deal to license the name Dwarf Fortress from another company. Adams felt that this amount would not equate to long-term donations and that he prefers working on his own—not being part of the gaming industry. Adams said, [...] "Barely in the black one month, a little in the red another month. ... It's a risk I'm willing to take, and really I couldn't have it any other way." [...] He has spent no money on advertising and was happy when bloggers, reviewers like former game journalist Kieron Gillen from PC Gamer and Games for Windows, wrote about his game. In 2015, Bay 12 Games set up a Patreon account to help fund it.|$|E
500|$|The film cuts to {{the closing}} credits from {{a shot of the}} top {{apparently}} starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, [...] "I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny to me is <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>really</b> do expect me to answer it." [...] The film's script concludes with [...] "Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT". [...] Nolan said, [...] "I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me — it always felt like the appropriate 'kick' to me... The real point of the scene — and this is what I tell people — is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing." [...] Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, [...] "If I'm there it's real, because I'm never in the dream. I'm the guy who invented the dream." ...|$|E

500|$|Zur {{began his}} career in 1994 by working on soundtracks for movies, such as Yellow Lotus, {{featured}} at the Sundance Film Festival. He signed on to compose for Fox Family for six years, and made soundtracks for various children's television shows, including Digimon and Power Rangers. By 2002, he estimated that he had composed the soundtrack to over 360 Power Rangers episodes. He won his first award during this period in his career, a Telly Award {{for his work on}} [...] While he enjoyed the work, he began to want to go work somewhere [...] "more intriguing, more advanced, and basically a place <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>really</b> appreciate music more"; his agent overcame his initial reluctance and convinced him to work in the video games industry. His first video game soundtrack was 2000's , which he started composing for the game in 1997. Zur moved on to prestigious titles, composing for the award-winning and critically acclaimed [...] in 2001 and Icewind Dale II in 2002, among many others. Icewind Dale II earned him the first of many nominations for video game music awards, that of the Game Audio Network Guild's Music of the Year award. He continued to work on movies and television programs during these years, composing the soundtrack to Au Pair in 1999 and the English version of the 2000 anime series Escaflowne.|$|E

2500|$|Fator's success {{stems from}} {{combining}} singing, ventriloquism, and comedy.

2500|$|According to Carl Atkins, many early editors {{took the}} sonnet {{at face value}} and {{believed}} that it was simply a disparagement of the writer's mistress. [...] However, William Flesch believes that the poem is actually quite the opposite, and acts as a compliment. [...] He points out that many poems of the day seem to compliment the object of the poem for qualities that they really don't have, such as snow white skin or golden hair. [...] He states <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>really</b> don't want to be complimented on a quality they don't have, e.g. an old person doesn't want to be told they are physically young, they want to be told they are youthful, in behavior or in looks. [...] Flesch notes that while what Shakespeare writes of can seem derisive, he is in reality complimenting qualities the mistress truly exhibits, and he ends the poem with his confession of love.|$|E
2500|$|The show's other {{prominent}} pairing, Nathan and Haley, {{emerged as a}} supercouple. James Lafferty, Nathan's portrayer, said, [...] "I think Nathan and Haley... Well Schwahn always says that he had that sort of as an 'ace in the hole' the entire time. As he was writing the pilot script, he was planning on doing that, he really didn't know how it would pan out or what would happen. But, the fans have responded so passionately towards it, and I'm not really sure why." [...] However, Lafferty has said {{that there is a}} genuine relationship between Nathan and Haley: [...] "It started as something sort of based on betrayal and deceit. It then kind of transgressed over into something based on actual true love. So, I think that it's a transition that the fans really bought into, and I think <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>really</b> enjoy to watch." [...] Schwahn called the couple [...] "gold" [...] and said, [...] "I love Nathan and Haley, and most of our audience does as well." [...] He explained that Nathan and Haley's fan base is strong because they have always been the most stable couple on the show, admitting that it confuses him when people ask when he is going to let them be happy. [...] "They have a lot of obstacles come their way," [...] said Schwahn, [...] "but I see them growing– especially with the jump [...] ahead and aging them a little bit– I see them growing into some really great places, not only as individuals, but as a family." ...|$|E

I became a sort of hermit, and lived in a rocky cave. I allowed my hair and beard to grow, so <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>really</b> thought I was getting older and older; at last I acquired the reputation of a prophet, and was held in veneration by a great many religious people. Of course I could not prophesy, but as I had such a vast deal of experience I was able to predicate intelligently something about the future from my knowledge of the past. I became famed as a wonderful seer, {{and there were a}} great many curious stories told about me.|$|E
6000|$|We had {{the pretty}} place almost to {{ourselves}} at that hour. There were a half-dozen or so nursemaids, pushing their perambulators about, or standing the vehicles across the walk {{in front of}} the benches where they sat, in the simple belief of all people who have to do with babies {{that the rest of the}} world may be fitly discommoded in their behalf. But they did not actively molest us, and they scarcely circumscribed our choice of seats. We were by no means driven to the little kiosk in the lake for them, and I should rather say that we were fatefully led there, so apt were the associations of the place to my purpose. Nothing could have been more natural than that I should say, as we sat down there, [...] "This was where I first saw Miss Gage with her friends"; and it was by a perfectly natural transition that I should go on to speak, in a semi-humorous strain, of the responsibility which Mrs. March and myself had incurred by letting our sympathy for her run away with us. I said I supposed that if we had not been willing from the first to try to realise for her some of the expectations we imagined she had in coming to Saratoga, she never would have fallen to our charge; <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>really</b> brought a great many more things upon themselves than they were willing to own; and that fate was perhaps more the fulfilment of our tacit ambitions than our overt acts. This bit of philosophy, which I confess I thought fine, did not seem to impress Kendricks. He merely said that it must be great fun to have the chance of baffling the malice of circumstance in a case like that, and I perceived that he felt nothing complex in the situation. In fact, I doubt whether youth perceives anything complex in life. To the young, life is a very plain case. To be sure, they are much more alarmed than their elders at getting tangled up in its web at times, but that is because they have not had our experience in getting untangled, and think they are never going to get out alive. When they do, they think that it is the only tangle they are ever going to be in, and do not know that they are simply going on from one to another as long as there is enough of them left to be caught in a mesh. To Kendricks we Marches were simply two amiable people, who had fancied doing a pleasant thing for a beautiful girl that accident had thrown it in our power to befriend, and were by no means the trembling arbiters of her destiny we felt ourselves to be. The difference between his objective sense and my subjective sense was the difference between his twenty-seven years and my fifty-two, and while this remained I saw that it would be useless to try to get on common ground with him, or to give him our point of view. If I were to speak to him at all, it must be with authority, with the right of one who stood in the place of the girl's parents, and had her happiness at heart. That is, it was something like that; but my words say it too bluntly. I found myself beginning, [...] "I have rather had a notion that her father might come on, and take the enterprise off our hands," [...] though, to tell the truth, I had never imagined such a thing, which came into my head at that moment through an association with the thought of parents.|$|E

5000|$|In some {{strands of}} postmodernism, nations {{are no longer}} viewed as legally {{enforced}} territories but as imagined communities in which national identification becomes increasingly vaguer.
