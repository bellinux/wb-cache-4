40|$|This talk is {{concerned}} with questions arising from the problem of classification of compact complex manifolds. Recall that the classification of compact Riemann surfaces is well-known. The Enriques-Kodaira classification of compact complex surfaces covers the two-dimensional case, and is considered complete modulo some questions concerning surfaces of class V II 0.

On the other hand, if the algebraic condition is dropped, things became a great deal more complicated. To illustrate this, in 1990 Taubes proved that every smooth compact oriented 4 -manifold admits metrics with anti-self-dual Weyl curvature after taking connected sums with enough copies of P 2. The twistor space of such a manifold is a complex 3 -manifold fibred by P 1 ’s.

40|$|What {{do people}} want from leaders? That {{question}} has been asked for generations. In recent history, a huge growth in leadership studies has produced {{a wealth of information}} on this topic, but because of the multitude of publications, there are now many competing schools of thought about what qualities make a great leader. This paper seeks to understand the qualities that people look for in leaders and to understand if any consistent patterns emerge from these desired traits. This is done through two avenues. Firstly, a survey of the existing leadership publications in several different established leadership genres provides an understanding of what the experts seek from leaders. Several military publications show how the modern U. S. military is trying to develop quality leaders. A look at values based leadership publications shows what many leading consultants and professional leadership development experts are looking for. In addition, several business publications and international leadership sources expand the understanding of what <b>the</b> <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> a leader should be. Secondly, a survey conducted among various individuals from different fields helps to determine what qualities are desired in great leaders. These two pieces of information, when taken as a whole, create an understanding of what people are expecting from leaders. In the end, a recommended typology for leadership development is presented as a means for spurring future research...|$|E

40|$|Under what {{conditions}} is it legitimate to accept some {{claim on the}} basis of authority—in particular, the authority of an expert? Let the claim be p. A widespread textbook view is that for it to be legitimate to accept p {{on the basis of}} the authority of an expert, E, the following conditions must be satisfied: (1) p must belong to some body of knowledge, k; (2) E must be an expert on k; (3) E must not have a vested interest in p's being true, or be otherwise suspect as a professed authority on whether p is true; and, finally, (4) the experts on k must agree about p. (Cf. Govier: 84.) This last condition—call it the agreement condition—is of special relevance to the authors ' concerns. We find the condition affirmed in textbooks, in various ways. For example, one textbook says that we assess the credibility of an expert's testimony partly by seeing whether or not the matter is controversial among experts. If the experts disagree about some claim, then we can't decide for or against that claim on the basis of what <b>the</b> <b>experts</b> <b>say.</b> (Pinto, Blair, Parr: 34 - 5).

For all, it is a bitter-sweet confirmation of the difficulties involved in dealing with those sometimes painful moral problems that they have encountered over what is often several years of practice. Indeed, it is as if through the exchange of narratives, each student feels not only marginally unburdened but free to finally state those things that really matter to them in a forum where others actually appreciate their opinions. But then at some point, we come to an examination of what is currently called nursing ‘moral distress’, and slowly but surely, a rising degree of exasperation and annoyance emerges around the room, as one by one the students all focus on the same question, namely, ‘What are we to do about moral distress?’ Moral distress is a phenomenon that is a reality in nursing however it is labelled or packaged, and what-ever <b>the</b> <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> it is or it is not.

Actually there is not a quantitative damage records to allow determinate the best way which areas have been taken part by patching methods. The project is divided in three principal parts: the first consists to determinate the damages on pavement surface (rigid or flexible). The second is an economic analysis for the use of new materials, and the last is about technical comparison of actual patching activities used. The tool used to determinate of damages was based in SIECA’s manuals, and was complemented with other documents of organizations to take charge of pavement maintenance. When the tool was developed, it was used to take the damage of the rigid and flexible selected sections for the 1 - 7, Cartago conservation zone. The materials that analyzed as a possibility of usage for patching activities were: warm mix asphalt, cold-mix asphalt, rolled compacted concrete (RCC) and high initial resistance concrete (Fast-Track); taking as a price reference HMA patching activities. From the materials used, was found that the price of cold-mix asphalt less expensive than the HMA.

The project utilized mixed method, exploratory action research to collect data in three phases and from three perspectives for triangulation: Phase One [...] what do <b>the</b> <b>experts</b> <b>say?</b> Phase Two [...] what do the numbers say? and Phase Three [...] what do the schools say? Primary data included interviews {{as well as the}} IRS Tax Form 990 submitted by small Maui schools over a three-year period. Patton's Actual-Ideal Comparative Evaluation Format guided integration of the data in order to produce an adjusted vision for the financial sustainability of Maui's small independent schools. The key finding was that financial sustainability relies on a clearly articulated and relevant mission activating "passion and heart" for what the school is doing, and personal sacrifice by faculty, staff, and parents. This mission was central to two strands of action for the school: 1) expressing "the soul of a school" so that strong enrollment and donations result, and 2) developing strategic action for the school so that finances are managed and the school adapts to the environment. Execution of the school's mission relied on an entrepreneurial spirit of "doing what it takes," "planning for growth," "defying odds," and "taking a chance. " Limitations of this study included its focus on six small schools on Maui, and a single researcher approach. This study contributed to HAIS' {{understanding of the nature of}} a small school on Maui, and provided the Maui schools with an opportunity to self-define their existence, especially within the context of accreditation...|$|E
