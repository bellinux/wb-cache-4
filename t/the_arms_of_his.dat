5|$|The Earl of Warwick's {{coat of arms}} {{was unusually}} complex for the period, with seven {{different}} quarterings. The first quarter consists of <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father-in-law, Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, who bore his arms with an escutcheon of De Clare quartering Despenser (<b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife Isabel le Despenser), which Warwick showed in the fourth quarter. The second quarter showed {{the arms of the}} Montacutes (quartered with the Monthermer arms). The third quarter showed the arms of Neville differenced by a label for Lancaster to signify descent from Warwick's father, the Earl of Salisbury, who was the eldest son and heir of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland and his wife, Lady Joan Beaufort, daughter of the Duke of Lancaster.|$|E
5|$|Vainio {{gave his}} last {{performance}} on 12 October 1990. He {{died of a}} heart attack in his home in Gryon, Switzerland, on October 29, 1990, in <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife. He was 52 years old. A burial ceremony was held in the town of Vevey, and Vainio's body brought back to Finland and buried in the family grave in Hietaniemi graveyard in Helsinki.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} photography for {{the film}} began in Mexico on January 27, 1997 on a $60 million budget. The Mask of Zorro was mostly shot at Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City. Production stalled for four days in February when the director, Martin Campbell, was hospitalized for bronchitis. Filming resumed in Tlaxcala, three hours east of Mexico City, where the production crew constructed the Montero hacienda and town set pieces. Sony sent David Foster to join the project as a producer to help fill the void left by Steven Spielberg, Walter F. Parkes, and Laurie MacDonald, who were busy running DreamWorks. Foster and David S. Ward, who went uncredited, re-wrote some scenes; the troubled production caused The Mask of Zorro to go $10 million over its budget. In December, the producers were frustrated by customs agents when some props and other items, including Zorro's plastic sword, were held for nine days. During the post-production phase, Spielberg and Campbell decided that Diego de la Vega's death in <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> daughter was too depressing. The ending, where Alejandro and Eléna are happily married with their infant son, was added three months after filming had ended.|$|E

25|$|York {{remained}} in Ireland. He {{did not set}} foot in England until 9 September, and when he did, he acted as a king. Marching under <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> maternal great-great-grandfather Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, he displayed a banner of the Coat of Arms of England as he approached London.|$|E
25|$|Charles Edward {{was never}} granted {{arms in the}} United Kingdom. Also, he did not inherit <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father since royal arms, as a differenced version of Arms of Dominion, are granted {{individually}} and not inherited. On his accession as Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, he used the arms of that duchy, both the greater and lesser versions.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, Rilke's illness was {{diagnosed}} as leukaemia. He suffered ulcerous sores in his mouth, pain troubled his stomach and intestines, and he struggled with increasingly low spirits. Open-eyed, he died in <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> doctor on December 29, 1926, in the Valmont Sanatorium in Switzerland. He was buried on January 2, 1927, in the Raron cemetery {{to the west of}} Visp.|$|E
60|$|The old man's hand slid {{from the}} throat to <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> prisoner, without {{relaxing}} its firmness.|$|R

25|$|One variant that he {{used was}} a shield of the arms of Saxony, with a differenced version of {{the arms of the}} United Kingdom, charged with the label borne by his father on his father's arms (essentially, <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father in reverse). This was similar to the arms borne by his uncle, Alfred, as Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, which can be seen on his stall plate as a Knight of the Swedish Order of the Seraphim.|$|E
25|$|But whether {{complete}} or not, the Confutatio {{had little}} success; the attack {{attributed to the}} Jesuits was successful. Scioppius was wont to boast that his book had killed Scaliger. The Confutatio was Scaliger's last work. Five months after it appeared, on 21 January 1609, {{at four in the}} morning, he died at Leiden in <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> son Heinsius. In his will Scaliger bequeathed his renowned collection of manuscripts and books (tous mes livres de langues étrangères, Hebraiques, Syriens, Arabiques, Ethiopiens) to Leiden University Library.|$|E
25|$|It {{was more}} against his brother than his foreign enemies that Nicomedes now {{called in the}} {{assistance}} of more powerful auxiliaries and entered into an alliance with the Celts who, under Leonnorius and Lutarius, had arrived {{on the opposite side}} of the Bosphorus and were, at this time, engaged in the siege of Byzantium, 277 BC. Having furnished them with the means of crossing into Asia, where they founded Galatia, he first turned <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> new auxiliaries against Zipoetes II, whom he defeated and put to death, and thus reunited the whole of Bithynia under his dominion.|$|E

25|$|Charles Louis {{was born}} at the Royal Palace of Madrid. His father, {{a member of the}} house of Bourbon-Parma, was Louis, Prince of Piacenza, son and heir of Ferdinand, Duke of Parma. His mother, Infanta Maria Louisa of Spain, was a {{daughter}} of King Charles IV of Spain. They had married in 1795 when the Hereditary Prince of Parma came to Madrid in search of a wife. The couple remained in Spain for the first years of their married life. It was for this reason that Charles Louis was born in Madrid at his maternal grandfather's court and he was included in Francisco de Goya's famous portrait of the family of Charles IV, in <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, a giraffe called Victor tore {{a muscle}} in his leg, {{collapsed}} on his stomach, and {{was unable to}} get up. The press suggested that he had slipped while trying to mate and compared his situation to the splits. All attempts to get him on his feet failed, and his plight became a major international news story. Portsmouth Dockyard made a hoist to attempt to raise him onto his feet. He {{died of a heart attack}} very shortly afterward in <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> keeper Ruth. The publicity turned Marwell into a major tourist attraction, and interest was revived the following summer, when Victor's mate, Dribbles, gave birth to a female calf named Victoria.|$|E
25|$|We {{left the}} town, fleeing this living picture of Sodom, with incessant fear lest the raging {{waters of the}} lake {{overtake}} us, which were at the moment invading {{the main part of}} the town, sweeping away everything they encountered. On the outskirts of the town, I came upon a woman who was so exhausted by her burden of two little children and a bundle of clothing that she could proceed no farther. Moved by pity, I took one of the toddlers from her and carried him, and the little indio who has been wailing while in <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother, stopped short when I took him into mine and never uttered a sound while I was carrying him a good piece of the way.|$|E
60|$|Her {{hand was}} on <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chair, and <b>the</b> act <b>of</b> laying <b>his</b> own {{on it was}} an {{assurance}} stronger than words. Alison sighed.|$|R
60|$|Here the Baronet paused. He seemed lost in thought, and sat looking {{upon the}} floor and {{drumming}} with <b>his</b> fingers on <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chair.|$|R

25|$|Out of the {{fourteen}} traditional Stations of the Cross, only eight have clear scriptural foundation. Stations 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9 are not specifically attested {{to in the}} gospels (in particular, no evidence exists of station 6 ever being known before medieval times) and Station 13 (representing Jesus's body being taken down off the cross and laid in <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother Mary) seems to embellish the gospels' record, which states that Joseph of Arimathea took Jesus down from the cross and buried him. To provide {{a version of this}} devotion more closely aligned with the biblical accounts, Pope John Paul II introduced a new form of devotion, called the Scriptural Way of the Cross on Good Friday 1991. He celebrated that form many times but not exclusively at the Colosseum in Rome.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Napoleon invaded Spain {{with a huge}} army in late 1808, {{scattered}} the Spanish forces, {{and seized}} Madrid. However, {{the appearance of a}} British army commanded by John Moore caused the French emperor to order his army to pursue the British into northwest Spain. With their enemies spread thin, the Spanish armies began to revive. In late December 1808, the Army of the Center led by Pedro de Alcántara Álvarez de Toledo, 13th Duke of the Infantado advanced slowly toward Madrid, causing alarm among the scanty French forces guarding the capital. The cautious Infantado sent his lieutenant Venegas with a strong vanguard to annoy the French. After Venegas won a minor action at Tarancón, Victor concentrated his corps and marched against him in mid-January 1809. Without instructions or support from Infantado, Venegas unwisely tried to hold a strong position at Uclés. Victor overwhelmed the Spanish defenders with one division and herded many of them into <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> second division which had marched around their flank. Gathering up Venegas' survivors, Infantado led his crippled army into the mountains but not before losing much of his artillery. Blamed for the fiasco, Infantado was relieved of command. The next action in the area was the Battle of Ciudad Real in March.|$|E
25|$|The most sensational ghost story, and {{one that}} {{developed}} rapidly in form {{from the time of}} its first telling in the mid 1990s, is the story of Hannah Watson and her lover. Hannah, the wife of Captain Thomas Watson, the Harbour Master of Port Jackson, according to the legend, {{was having an affair with}} Captain John Steane of the Royal Navy. Thomas Watson, on discovering his wife's infidelity, cursed the lovers. Hannah wrote to Steane, begging him not to return to Sydney, but it was too late. Hannah Watson died and was buried in the cemetery. John Steane outlived Hannah by only a few days. The ship in which he was returning to <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> beloved was the ill-fated Dunbar. John Steane's body was one of the few that were recovered intact. It is buried in a separate grave near the Dunbar Tomb, and only a few metres from the plot where Thomas Watson had recently buried his wife. It is claimed that Hannah Watson has been seen emerging from her tomb in the form of a ghostly grey lady. She is said to drift slowly to the grave of her erstwhile lover. Although the tale has been told many times, and has been used as the basis for a work of fiction, no investigation into the possibility of a love-affair between Hannah Watson and Captain John Steane has yet been made. John Steane's descendants continue to live in the vicinity of Newtown.|$|E

6000|$|Sir Isaac's hand {{tightened}} on <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chair. [...] "I started 'em {{to please}} you," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't start 'em to please your friends." ...|$|R
500|$|Upon his {{marriage}} to Queen Victoria in 1840, Prince Albert received a personal grant of arms, being the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom differenced by a white three-point label with a red cross in the centre, quartered with his ancestral arms of Saxony. They are blazoned: [...] "Quarterly, 1st and 4th, the Royal Arms, with overall a label of three points Argent charged on the centre with cross Gules; 2nd and 3rd, Barry of ten Or and Sable, a crown of rue in bend Vert". The arms are unusual, being described by S. T. Aveling as a [...] "singular example of quartering differenced arms, [...] is not {{in accordance with the}} rules of Heraldry, and is in itself an heraldic contradiction." [...] Prior to {{his marriage}} Albert used <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father undifferenced, in accordance with German custom.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fifteenth}} century, Bishop Thomas Beckington left {{much of his}} estate to the Vicars' Choral, {{enabling}} repairs to be carried out. The gardens {{in front of the}} houses were not part of the original scheme with the garden walls being added as part of this development. The walls are on average [...] {{from the front of the}} houses. He unified the appearance of the terraces including the installation of a single arch-braced and wind-braced trussed sloping roof around 1466. The chimney shafts were renewed and raised, possibly because of the introduction of coal as the fuel rather than wood. Each stack incorporates two heraldic shields and the upper sections of the stacks are octagonal. The shields are those of the Bishop, a beacon above tun, and <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> three executors; sugar loaves for Hugh Sugar, three swans for Richard Swan, and the talbot for John Pope. Many of the original windows were replaced in the 18th century. Shrewsbury House is architecturally different from all the other buildings. It was re-built in the 19th century after a fire that burnt down the original structure.|$|E
500|$|Following the announcement, {{the senior}} Cardinal Deacon retreats, and papal aides unfurl a large, maroon banner {{that out of}} {{practicality}} often bears the late pope's arms in the centre, draping it onto the railing of the Basilica's loggia. During Pope Francis' announcement, there was no image of his predecessor's arms (indicating that the previous pope was still alive), and during Pope Pius XI's first appearance following his election at the 1922 conclave, the banner showed the arms of Pope Pius IX instead of <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> immediate predecessor Pope Benedict XV. [...] The new pope then emerges onto the balcony to the adulation of the crowd, while a brass band in the forecourt below plays the Pontifical Anthem. He then imparts the Urbi et Orbi blessing. The Pope may on this occasion choose to give the shorter episcopal blessing as his first Apostolic Blessing instead of the traditional Urbi et Orbi blessing, this happened most recently with Pope Paul VI after his election at the 1963 conclave [...] Beginning with Pope John Paul II, the last three popes elected including Pope Francis, have chosen to address the crowds first before imparting the Urbi et Orbi blessing. [...] Also, at Pope Francis' first appearance, he led the faithful first in prayers for his predecessor and asked them for prayers for himself before imparting the Urbi et Orbi blessing.|$|E
