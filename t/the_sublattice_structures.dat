40|$|The {{interest}} in strongly correlated systems in frustrated lattices has been increased recently {{due to the}} possible realization of exotic magnetic states, spin, and charge separation in two dimensions, and the discovery of superconductivity in NaxCoO 2 yH 2 O. In a recent Letter, Baskaran and Jafari have proposed {{the existence of a}} neutral spin collective mode for a graphene sheet that is modeled as a half-filled Hubbard model in the honeycomb lattice. These calculations were based on the random phase approximation (RPA), but the tensor character of the susceptibility for the honeycomb lattice was not considered in the calculations. Since inelastic neutron scattering can be used to study this spin collective mode in graphite, we decided to revisit the problem, taking into account the entire band <b>structure</b> and <b>the</b> <b>sublattice</b> <b>structure</b> of <b>the</b> honeycomb lattice.

40|$|Due {{to their}} unique {{electrical}} properties, graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) show great promise as {{the building blocks}} of novel electronic devices. However, these properties are strongly dependent on the geometry of the edges of the graphene devices. Thus far only zigzag and armchair edges have been extensively studied. However, several other self passivating edge reconstructions are possible, and were experimentally observed. Here we utilize the Nonequilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) technique in conjunction with tight binding methods to model quantum transport through armchair, zigzag, and several other self-passivated edge reconstructions. In addition we consider the experimentally relevant cases of mixed edges, where random combinations of possible terminations exist on a given GNR boundary. We find that transport through GNR's with self-passivating edge reconstructions is governed by <b>the</b> <b>sublattice</b> <b>structure</b> of <b>the</b> edges, {{in a manner similar to}} their parent zigzag or armchair configurations. Furthermore, we find that the reconstructed armchair GNR's have a larger band gap energy than pristine armchair edges and are more robust against edge disorder. These results offer novel insights into the transport in GNRs with realistic edges and are thus of paramount importance in the development of GNR based devices. Comment: J. Phys. Chem. C, 201...|$|R

40|$|We {{have applied}} Atomic Number Contract Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (Z-Contrast STEM) and STEM/EELS (Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) towards {{the study of}} {{colloidal}} CdSe semiconductor nanocrystals embedded in MEH-PPV polymer films. Unlike the case of conventional phase-contrast High Resolution TEM, Z-Contrast images are direct projections of the atomic structure. Hence they can be interpreted {{without the need for}} sophisticated image simulation and the image intensity is a direct measure of the thickness of a nanocrystal. Our thickness measurements are in agreement with the predicted faceted shape of these nanocrystals. Our unique 1. 3 A resolution STEM has successfully resolve 3 d <b>the</b> <b>sublattice</b> <b>structure</b> of these CdSe nanocrystals. In [010] projection (the polar axis in the image plane) we can distinguish Se atom columns from Cd columns. Consequently we can study the effects of lattice polarity on the nanocrystal morphology. Furthermore, since the STEM technique does not rely on diffraction, it is superbly suited to the study of non-periodic detail, such as the surface structure of the nanocrystals. EELS measurements on individual nanocrystals indicate a significant amount (equivalet to 0. 5 - 1 surface monolayers) of oxygen on the nanocrystals, despite processing in an inert atmosphere. Spatially resolved measurements at 7 A resolution suggest a surface oxide layer. However, the uncertainty in the measurement precludes definitive assignment at this time.

40|$|We {{present a}} mean-field theory for the {{dynamics}} of driven flow with exclusion in graphenelike structures, and numerically check its predictions. We treat first a specific combination of bond transmissivity rates, where mean field predicts, and numerics {{to a large extent}} confirms, that <b>the</b> <b>sublattice</b> <b>structure</b> characteristic of honeycomb networks becomes irrelevant. Dynamics, in the various regions of the phase diagram set by open boundary injection and ejection rates, is then in general identical to that of one-dimensional systems, although some discrepancies remain between mean-field theory and numerical results, in similar ways for both geometries. However, at the critical point for which the characteristic exponent is z = 3 / 2 in one dimension, the mean-field value z = 2 is approached for very large systems with constant (finite) aspect ratio. We also treat a second combination of bond (and boundary) rates where, more typically, sublattice distinction persists. For the two rate combinations, in continuum or late-time limits, respectively, the coupled sets of mean-field dynamical equations become tractable with various techniques and give a two-band spectrum, gapless in the critical phase. While for the second rate combination quantitative discrepancies between mean-field theory and simulations increase for most properties and boundary rates investigated, theory still is qualitatively correct in general, and gives a fairly good quantitative account of features such as the late-time evolution of density profile differences from their steady-state values.

40|$|Majorana {{boundary}} quasiparticles may naturally {{emerge in}} a spin-singlet superconductor with Rashba spin-orbit interactions, when a Zeeman magnetic field breaks time-reversal symmetry. Their existence and robustness against adiabatic changes is deeply related, via a bulk-edge correspondence, to topological {{properties of the}} band structure. The present paper shows that the spin-orbit {{may be responsible for}} topological transitions when the superconducting system has an underlying <b>sublattice</b> <b>structure,</b> as it appears in a dimerized Peierls chain, graphene, and phosphorene. These systems, which belong to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes class D, are found to have an extra symmetry that plays the role of the parity. It enables the characterization of the topology of the particle-hole symmetric band structure in terms of band inversions. The topological phase diagrams this leads to are then obtained analytically and exactly. They reveal that, because of <b>the</b> underlying <b>sublattice</b> <b>structure,</b> <b>the</b> existence of topological superconducting phases requires a minimum doping fixed by the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit. Majorana boundary quasiparticles are finally predicted to emerge when the Fermi level lies {{in the vicinity of the}} bottom (top) of the conduction (valence) band in semiconductors such as the dimerized Peierls chain and phosphorene. In a two-dimensional topological superconductor based on (stretched) graphene, which is semimetallic, Majorana quasiparticles cannot emerge at zero and low doping, that is, when the Fermi level is close to the Dirac points.
