5|$|Simms {{made his}} Football League debut at Lincoln City {{in place of}} Caesar Jenkyns, who had missed his train. In bitterly cold weather, after snow had been cleared from the pitch, Lincoln took {{advantage}} of winning the toss by choosing to play downhill, and took a 2–1 lead. On change of ends, Small Heath {{came back into the}} game, and scored <b>twice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> quarter of an hour to take the game 4–3.|$|E
5|$|Resuming the {{partnership}} with Marko Pantelić {{begun in the}} second half of 2003–04, Žigić continued to score freely in the new season. With Red Star two goals and a man down in the first leg of the Champions League qualifier against Young Boys, he netted <b>twice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 12 minutes to give his team an away draw. Domestically, Pantelić top-scored with 21 league goals and Žigić contributed 15 as Red Star finished in second place, behind Partizan. Žigić scored against Partizan to help Red Star reach the cup final, but was one of five regular starters unavailable for that match through injury or suspension, and his team lost to a last-minute goal to ten-man Železnik.|$|E
25|$|The cup campaigns brought little joy, with a 3rd round League Cup defeat to Motherwell and an agonising quarter-final Scottish Cup defeat to Celtic {{who scored}} <b>twice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> minute to win 2–1. Embarrassingly, the club lost on {{penalties}} to Stenhousemuir in the Scottish Challenge Cup final, although didn't concede {{during the entire}} tournament.|$|E

25|$|Interpretations of {{the shadowy}} Conall mac Taidg are {{determined}} {{largely by the}} shifting views of historians with regard to Caustantín mac Fergusa and the later origins of the Kingdom of Alba, a subject where the consensus may have changed <b>twice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> few decades having previously been stable {{since the time of}} William Forbes Skene. Skene made Conall a king of the Picts, later reinterpretations made him first a king of the Picts, then, following his expulsion by Caustantín, a king in Dál Riata. Recent reinterpretations make him a king in Argyll throughout, but not necessarily the chief king.|$|E

25|$|The {{second game}} of the season came on the road against long-time rivals the Michigan Wolverines, led by coach Lloyd Carr and second year {{starting}} quarterback, Chad Henne. Michigan had moved up to 3rd in the nation from a pre-season ranking of 4th after a 16-point win against Northern Illinois. Coming into the season, Michigan had not lost a home game since 2002 with a streak of 16 games and hadn't lost a non-conference home game since 1998. Also, despite beating the Wolverines <b>twice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> three years including a 28-20 win over the then 7th ranked Wolverines in 2004, the Irish hadn't won at Michigan since 1993.|$|E
25|$|The {{last game}} of the round robin of the NatWest Series was, as expected, won by the Australians. However, it summed up the {{improvement}} Bangladesh had made over the tour of England. In the first international, they were rolled over meekly by a no-balling, rusty English side – <b>twice.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last,</b> Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie put the pressure on early, and {{with the aid of}} Shane Watson had them on the reels with 75 for 5. Yet, Bangladesh recovered to post 250 for 8, and were theoretically in with a chance for most of the game. Yet, they started very, very shakily. Javed Omar was dropped by Matthew Hayden in the third over, only to be out to Jason Gillespie in the next for an eight-ball duck – a disappointing end to a fine series for the Bangladeshi. Brett Lee had both Tushar Imran and Mohammad Ashraful beaten with full deliveries, Bangladesh were 19 for three wickets down – an all too familiar position.|$|E
25|$|The women's final was {{scheduled}} to be played on the Saturday, with two of the biggest stars on the WTA Tour in Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams set to face each other. The fans who expected a tough battle were eventually disappointed though, as Williams dominated the top-seeded Russian from start to finish. Her game was completely on form throughout the match, with Sharapova only managing to hold service once in the first set as Williams hit winner after winner. The second set was no different, although Sharapova managed to hold <b>twice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> set but Williams was too good and prevailed 6–1, 6–2 to win her eighth Grand Slam title and her third Australian Open title. At the trophy presentation, Williams dedicated her win to Yetunde Price, her elder half-sister who was shot in September 2003. Williams became the third-lowest-ranked major titlist since 1975, after Evonne Goolagong and Chris O'Neil who won here in 1977 and 1978 respectively.|$|E

25|$|Following their West Lancashire League {{championship}} {{success in}} 2006–07, the club were accepted into Division Two of the North West Counties League for the 2007–08 season. At the club's {{annual general meeting}} (AGM) in July 2007, a 15-year plan was put forward with the stated aim of reaching the Conference National by 2017, and The Football League by 2022. The club's first match in the North West Counties League was a home match on 11 August 2007, against Darwen in front of 101 fans, which they won 5–0. The following Tuesday they played their first ever home match under floodlights winning 2–0 at home to Holker Old Boys On 8 September the club played their first ever match in the FA Vase, beating Northern Counties East League Division One club Worsbrough Bridge Athletic 3–0. The club had also arranged for the FA Vase trophy to be on display before the game. On 26 January 2008 the club reached the last sixteen of the FA Vase when they beat Studley 3–0. On 9 February they reached the quarter-finals after they beat Sussex County League leaders, Crowborough Athletic 2–0 {{in front of a}} record crowd of 772 at Crowborough's Alderbrook Recreation Ground. They subsequently defeated Midland Football Alliance club Coventry Sphinx 1–0 in a replay after a 3–3 draw. In the two-legged semi-final against Eastern Counties League Premier Division club, Needham Market, Kirkham & Wesham won 4–2 on aggregate. On 11 May, Kirkham & Wesham won the FA Vase in their first season in the competition, beating Lowestoft Town 2–1 in the final at Wembley Stadium in front of a crowd of 19,537, with about 14,000 from Lowestoft and about 3,500 Kirkham & Wesham supporters. A goal down for most of the game, Kirkham & Wesham scored <b>twice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> six minutes, both goals coming from seventeen-year-old substitute Matt Walwyn, son of former Blackpool player Keith Walwyn, who only played the last 11 minutes of the game. Kirkham & Wesham secured prize money of £20,000 for their win. Although the total amount the club earned was expected to be around £75,000. The season also saw the club win the Division Two knockout trophy with a 1–0 win over Bootle, as well as securing promotion to the Premier Division when they beat Castleton Gabriels 3–1 on 26 April.|$|E

Everly desperately struggles to escape and help her mother. She breaks one of the ropes that The Sadist had loosened before and uses her free hand to kill one of the assailants with a hidden gun. When The Sadist realizes she has a hidden gun, she shoots him <b>twice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lung. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> torturer runs toward Everly with a weapon, only to die when she shoots him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chest and neck.

He qualified for the UK Open and defeated Johnny Clayton 5-1 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first round, but then lost 5-4 against Kevin McDine. Wattimena <b>twice</b> lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 16 of Players Championship events during the year and beat Robert Marijanović 6-5 at the European Darts Grand Prix, but was then knocked out 6-3 by Peter Wright <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second round.|$|R

500|$|The team {{finished}} {{fourth in the}} league in Bergkamp's final season at Arsenal. Bergkamp scored an injury-time winner against Thun on Matchday 1 of the Champions League, having come on as a substitute in the 72nd minute. After much campaigning from Arsenal supporters, the club designated one of its Highbury matchday themes, organised to commemorate the stadium's final season as home of Arsenal, to Dennis Bergkamp. [...] "Bergkamp Day" [...] took place on 15 April 2006 and saw Arsenal up against West Bromwich Albion. It celebrated the player's contribution to Arsenal; fans were given commemorative orange [...] "DB10" [...] T-shirts – the colour of his national team, his initials and his squad number. Bergkamp himself came on as a second-half substitute and set up the winning Robert Pirès goal moments after Nigel Quashie had levelled the scoreline. Fittingly, Bergkamp's 89th-minute goal proved to be his last for Arsenal in competitive football. Bergkamp was an unused substitute in his final match for Arsenal against Barcelona in the Champions League final; Barcelona scored <b>twice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 13 minutes to overturn Arsenal's early lead and win the competition.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts persisted over Messi's form, as he {{finished}} an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season with Barcelona. At {{the start of the}} tournament, however, he gave strong performances, being elected man of the match in their first four matches. In his first World Cup match as captain, he led them to a 2–1 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina; he helped create their early opening goal and scored their second strike after a dribble past three players, his first World Cup goal since his debut in the tournament eight years earlier. During the second match against Iran, he scored an injury-time goal from [...] out to end the game in a 1–0 win, securing their qualification for the knockout phase. He scored <b>twice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> group match, a 3–2 victory over Nigeria, his second goal from a free kick, as they finished first in their group. Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1–0 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, before starting the play that led to their match-winning 1–0 goal in the quarter-final against Belgium, helping Argentina progress to the semi-final of the World Cup {{for the first time since}} 1990. Following a 0–0 draw in extra time, they eliminated the Netherlands 4–2 in a penalty shootout to reach the final.|$|E
500|$|Manchester United {{started their}} {{campaign}} {{to win an}} unprecedented third straight title at White Hart Lane — Teddy Sheringham's former stomping ground. An hour into his debut presented him {{with a chance to}} score from a dubious penalty, but he hit the post and blasted the rebound wide. What seemed like a pulsating draw turned out to be business as usual for the champions, who scored <b>twice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ten minutes from a Nicky Butt strike and an own goal by hapless defender Ramon Vega. David Beckham came off the bench to grab the winner against Southampton to ensure United remained in the driving seat and despite a lacklustre goalless draw to Leicester at Filbert Street, they managed a third straight clean sheet. Beckham kept up his ever-improving goal-scoring record while Sheringham poached his first goal for the club as Ferguson's all-conquering United dismantled Everton at Goodison Park. At home to Coventry, Andy Cole marked his return from minor surgery with a goal inside 73 seconds that left goalkeeper, Steve Ogrizovic completely bamboozled. Keane and Poborský added to the rout, which Ferguson and Coventry boss Gordon Strachan mutually agreed was a [...] "flattering scoreline". The champions set the benchmark in August with five straight clean sheets and eight goals leaving them joint top with Blackburn Rovers. In such commanding form, pundits alike reckoned that {{it was a matter of}} time before they would resume their domestic supremacy.|$|E
