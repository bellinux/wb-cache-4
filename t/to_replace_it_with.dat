Along with the grass, a heating and drainage system was also installed at a cost of $3.5million to MLSE.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Henry {{instructed}} the coachman to gather his remaining body parts in a cloth tied with blue string, {{place it in}} a cart drawn by a stallion. When the stallion broke, he was <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> an ox, and when the ox stopped, he was to build a church. This is where Henrik’s remains were to be buried.|$|E
5|$|By 1953, the {{lighthouse}} was in poor {{condition and the}} U.S. Coast Guard opted <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a skeleton tower. The lighthouse was sold to the Fairfield Dock Company, which initially planned to move it ashore, but it was later decided to dismantle and scrap it. A plan existed to move {{the lighthouse}} ashore to a city park as a monument to Connecticut's maritime heritage, but the location could not be agreed upon.|$|E
50|$|Sales of the Mustang {{remained}} strong, {{although in}} the 1980s Ford gave serious consideration <b>to</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a front-drive model (which eventually appeared as the Ford Probe instead). Emissions and fuel economy concerns led many of the latter-day pony cars to offer four-cylinder engines (sometimes with turbocharging), although they were never as popular as six-cylinder and V8 models.|$|R

5|$|The first {{structure}} {{in what is}} now Sheerness was a fort built by order of Henry VIII to prevent enemy ships from entering the River Medway and attacking the naval dockyard at Chatham. In 1666 work began <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a stronger fort. However, before its completion, this second fort was destroyed during the 1667 Dutch raid on the Medway. The Secretary of the Admiralty, Samuel Pepys, subsequently ordered the construction of Sheerness Dockyard as an extension to that at Chatham.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russian Civil War {{the victorious}} Bolsheviks {{considered}} finishing Izmail, and possibly Borodino, to their original design. It would have taken at least two years to build all of Izmails turrets, even if enough guns had been available. Ten had been delivered by Vickers before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912, but the prospects that more guns could be purchased from Vickers or that the Soviets could make more were not promising, given the state of their heavy industry {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. Another problem was the complicated electrical system; it could not be completed under current conditions, and at least twenty months would be required <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a simpler system.|$|E
5|$|Charles I was a {{connoisseur}} of art, and paid {{greater attention to}} the aesthetic aspects of Windsor Castle than his predecessors. Charles had the castle completely surveyed by a team including Inigo Jones in 1629, but little of the recommended work was carried out. Nonetheless, Charles employed Nicholas Stone to improve the chapel gallery in the Mannerist style and to construct a gateway in the North Terrace. Christian van Vianen, a noted Dutch goldsmith, was employed to produce a baroque gold service for the St George's Chapel altar. In {{the final years of}} peace, Charles demolished the fountain in the Upper Ward, intending <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a classical statue.|$|E
50|$|The 2 cm auto-cannon {{proved to}} be {{ineffective}} against many Allied tanks, and experiments were conducted <b>with</b> a view <b>to</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a 37 mm cannon, but nothing came of this. Prototypes were built with a 50 mm tank gun, but by then the Panzer II had outlived its usefulness as a tank regardless of armament. Greater success was had by replacing the standard 2 cm armour-piercing explosive ammunition with tungsten cored solid ammunition, but due to shortages of tungsten this ammunition was in chronically short supply.|$|R

5|$|Due to the April 2007 Nor'easter, the Rainbow Lake Bridge in Pittsgrove Township {{was washed}} {{out and the}} New Jersey Department of Transportation had <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a new bridge. This closure led to detours for traffic {{traveling}} between Vineland and Bridgeton. The new Rainbow Lake Bridge was opened in November 2007. The bridge spanning the Maurice River, which connects Vineland and Pittsgrove Township, was closed in July 2007 for planned repairs. This bridge replacement, which was completed in December 2007, cost $5 million and provided a wider and higher crossing of the river.|$|E
5|$|Hearst first {{bought the}} monastery {{intending}} {{to replace the}} family retreat at Wyntoon, {{on the bank of}} the McCloud River near Mount Shasta in remote Northern California. The original building was his mother's Bernard Maybeck-designed fantasy chalet which burned down in 1929. Hearst wanted <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a great stone building fitted with towers and turrets—an eccentric castle folly that was to be larger than its predecessor. To prepare for the arrival of the Spanish stones, Morgan drew up plans with the monastery's chapter house serving as the castle's entrance hall, and the large church enclosing a swimming pool. Other stones were designated as cladding for walls and rooms on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|The Grey Cup {{has been}} stolen on two occasions: it {{disappeared}} {{for three days}} in 1967 when it {{was taken from the}} Hamilton Tiger-Cats as a prank, and in December 1969 it was stolen from the offices of the Ottawa Rough Riders at Lansdowne Park. The thieves attempted to ransom the trophy, but the CFL refused to pay and made plans <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a duplicate. An anonymous phone call led to the trophy's recovery two months later in a locker at Toronto's Royal York Hotel. The thieves were never found.|$|E

5000|$|In Roanoke's May 2, 2006, {{municipal}} elections, Harris {{and then}} vice mayor Beverly Fitzpatrick backed a successful slate of three Democrats, running on an independent ticket dubbed [...] "For the City" [...] against the nominees of the Democratic and Republican parties.

The local Democratic party considered sanctions against Harris for supporting the independent ticket but differences were smoothed out by 2008. Harris ran for re-election in the May 2008 municipal election but lost to former mayor and fellow Democrat David A. Bowers who ran as an Independent; two other Independents were also in the race: Anita Powell, and George A. Sgouros.|$|R

5|$|Trotsky and his {{supporters}} had been organised since 1923 as the Left Opposition. They opposed the bureaucratisation of the Soviet Union, which they analysed as being partly caused by the poverty and isolation of the Soviet economy. Stalin's theory of socialism in one country was developed in 1924 as an opposition to Trotsky's Theory of Permanent Revolution, which argued that capitalism was a world system and required a world revolution in order <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> socialism. Prior to 1924, the Bolsheviks' international perspective had been guided by Trotsky's position. Trotsky argued that Stalin's theory represented the interests of bureaucratic elements in direct opposition to the working class.|$|E
5|$|In 1840 the Bull Head Turnpike Company built {{a private}} toll road {{known today as}} the Sag Harbor Turnpike, which {{operated}} successfully until a competing railroad line opened in the 1880s. In 1906 the town of Southampton {{took control of the}} now dilapidated road and removed the toll gates. NY114 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and is known in part as the Sag Harbor Turnpike. The bridge carrying NY114 between Sag Harbor and North Haven is an arched bridge that serves as a village landmark. In 1999, residents successfully fought state proposals <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a girder bridge. Instead, the bridge was replaced with a new, wider bridge with ornamental lamps that closely resembles the original and is in the same location.|$|E
5|$|In April 1998, the St Germans {{pumping station}} ran at maximum capacity, which was 6134 Ml/d (or 71 tonnes per second), for over 50 hours, and {{this led to}} the {{decision}} <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a brand new installation, with 40% extra capacity. Work started in December 2006, and the pumping station, which is the second largest in Europe, includes a glass wall to enable visitors to see the pumps. The new station was commissioned on 22 April 2010, after which the old station was demolished. A formal opening ceremony was held on 20 April 2011, when the station was opened by Lord James Russell, brother of the Duke of Bedford, and a descendent of the Earl of Bedford who started the process of draining the Fens in the seventeenth century. There are more than one hundred smaller pumping stations scattered throughout the system to maintain the water levels and prevent flooding.|$|E

5|$|Global {{announced}} on 12 August 2013 that Real and Smooth would relocate their London and West Midlands offices to Global premises. Smooth Radio's output was relocated to Global's Leicester Square headquarters from 1 October, {{a move that}} coincided with a major overhaul of its schedule, and the closure of Smooth 70s after 21 months on air. On 4 February 2014, the Radio Today website reported that Ofcom had given Global Radio permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform, and <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a service playing music from the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Under this agreement, Smooth would continue to broadcast on its regional frequencies, but {{would be required to}} provide seven hours of local output per day. On 6 February, Global confirmed the sale of eight of its regional stationsincluding those with the Smooth Radio brand in the North West, North East and East Midlandsto the Irish media holdings company Communicorp. Under a franchising agreement between the two firms, these stations would retain the Smooth Radio name, but relaunch airing a mixture of both regional content and networked programming from London. Smooth would also take over Gold's medium wave frequencies, except in London, Manchester and the East Midlands. Global announced later that month that Smooth would be relaunched from 3 March, and subsequently confirmed the Gold changes would take effect from 24 March, when the stations would begin simulcasting with Smooth Radio London. This also coincided with the return of local programming at breakfast and drivetime.|$|E

Although the final design, funding and timeline for construction for the new bridge are yet to be determined, it will be wider and possibly shorter than the existing structure.
