This ballpark was the home of Nashville's minor league teams through 1963. In 1887, Nashville's Southern League team was called <b>the</b> <b>Nashville</b> Blues. <b>The</b> <b>Nashville</b> Tigers competed for the city in the same league from 1893 to 1894. In 1895, <b>the</b> <b>Nashville</b> Seraphs won the city's first professional championship in the Southern League. <b>The</b> <b>Nashville</b> Centennials played in the Central League in 1897, but relocated to Henderson, Indiana, during the season before the league's collapse.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nashville</b> sit-ins, {{which lasted}} from February 13 to May 10, 1960, {{were part of}} a nonviolent direct action {{campaign}} to end racial segregation at lunch counters in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. The sit-in campaign, coordinated by <b>the</b> <b>Nashville</b> Student Movement and Nashville Christian Leadership Council, was notable for its early success and emphasis on disciplined nonviolence. It was part of a broader sit-in movement that spread across the Southern United States {{in the wake of the}} Greensboro sit-ins in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nashville</b> {{sound was}} a popular kind of country music that arose in the 1950s, a fusion of popular big band jazz and swing with the lyricism of honky-tonk country. The popular success of Hank Williams' {{recordings}} had convinced record labels that country music could find mainstream audiences. Record companies then tried to strip the rough, honky-tonk elements from country music, removing the unapologetically rural sound that had made Williams famous. Nashville's industry was reacting {{to the rise of}} rockabilly performer Elvis Presley by marketing performers that crossed the divide between country and pop. Chet Atkins, head of RCA's country music division, did the most to innovate <b>the</b> <b>Nashville</b> sound by abandoning the rougher elements of country, while Owen Bradley used sophisticated production techniques and smooth instrumentation that eventually became standard in <b>the</b> <b>Nashville</b> Sound, which also grew to incorporate strings and vocal choirs. By {{the early part of the}} 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>Nashville</b> sound was perceived as watered-down by many more traditionalist performers and fans, resulting in a number of local scenes like the Lubbock sound and, most influentially, the Bakersfield sound.|$|E
5|$|Although serious {{efforts were}} made to oppose Jim Crow laws in Nashville as early as 1905, it was not until 1958, with the {{formation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Nashville</b> Christian Leadership Council, that Nashville's African American community would lay the foundation for dismantling racial segregation.|$|E

5|$|The city's longest-operating {{baseball}} team, {{first known}} as only <b>the</b> <b>Nashville</b> Baseball Club and later nicknamed <b>the</b> <b>Nashville</b> Vols (short for Volunteers), {{was formed in}} 1901 as a charter member of the Southern Association. They remained in the league through 1961, winning eight pennants, nine playoff championships, and four Dixie Series titles. The league disbanded after the 1961 season, and no team was fielded in 1962, but the Vols played one final season in the South Atlantic League in 1963. Sulphur Dell was demolished in 1969, and the city went without a professional team for 14 years until 1978.|$|E
