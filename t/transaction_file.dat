WAT{_}MOVE has three major sub-systems: one for retrieval, one for loading, and one for purging. The retrieval sub-system creates <b>transaction</b> <b>files</b> of retrieved data for transfer and invokes a file transfer to send the <b>transaction</b> <b>files</b> to the receiving site. The loading sub-system reads the control and <b>transaction</b> <b>files</b> retrieved from the source database and loads the data in the appropriate files.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new way}} of solving the storage reclamation problem for a system such as Lisp that allocates storage automatically from a heap, and does not require the programmer to give any indication that particular items are no longer useful or accessible. A reference count scheme for reclaiming non-self-referential structures, and a linearizing, compacting, copying scheme to reorganize all storage at the users discretion are proposed. The algorithms are designed to work well in systems which use multiple levels of storage, and large virtual address space. They depend on the fact that most cells are referenced exactly once, and that reference counts need only be accurate when storage is about to be reclaimed. A <b>transaction</b> <b>file</b> stores changes to reference counts, and a multiple reference table stores the count for items which are referenced more than once...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to find the}} associations among different web pages in a web log file of a website, and then divide the page of each user accessed, who is likely to visit the Web site more than once and create individual sessions. This can be done by computing the association rules in relation to the web pages by using the information from the web log file maintained by its web server. Such information containing association rules gives a broad view of user sequences. It can be extended to any field of activity that involves large bulks of data. This paper is concerned with web usage mining of web mining. The server maintains the information of usage data sequences done by different users. The web log file has the information about the different pages that have been accessed by the users and the secondary information about each URL. Considering that information, in order to perform an association rule analysis, which is also known as market basket analysis, there’s the need to define the basket; in the web environment this is not as clear as in a real supermarket. A phase of transaction identifiers is needed. Finally, after the application of one of these methods, the <b>transaction</b> <b>file</b> is created, the basket entities are defined and the discovery process of association rules can go on with the application of an Association Rule algorithm such as the Apriori one. To find the confidence among the web pages accessed, the user gives a user specified threshold value such as minimum support and minimum confidence values, which determines the probability of accessing a web page when a set of web pages are accessed...|$|E
