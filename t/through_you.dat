5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going <b>through,</b> <b>you</b> can get to the other side.|$|E

In his setting, Bach introduces dramatic syncopation for each declamation in [...] "Come, o death, you brother of sleep"; {{and it is only}} {{at the end of the}} penultimate line that torment and dissonance are transformed into glory and harmony, illuminating the words [...] "" [...] (for <b>through</b> <b>you</b> I will come to my loveliest little Jesus). Gardiner notes that it is Bach's only setting of Crüger's tune which recalls the style of his father's cousin Johann Christoph Bach whom he regarded as a 'profound composer'.|$|E

500|$|... "Running to Stand Still" [...] earned {{critical}} praise upon The Joshua Trees release, {{which itself}} received very favourable reviews {{and went on}} to become the group's best-selling album. Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "After the first few times <b>through</b> , <b>you</b> notice the remarkable music... It sounds like a lovely, peaceful reverie – except that this is a junkie's reverie, and when that realization hits home, the gentle acoustic lullaby acquires a corrosive power." [...] In Time magazine's 1987 cover story on the band, Jay Cocks wrote that [...] "A U2 tune like 'Running to Stand Still', with a trancelike melody that slips over the transom of consciousness, insinuates itself into your dreams." [...] The Uncut magazine Ultimate Music Guide to U2 described the character sketch in the song as one of Bono's best.

500|$|In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown {{described}} Gilmour's guitar {{style as}} [...] "characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures." [...] According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on [...] "Money", [...] "Time" [...] and [...] "Comfortably Numb" [...] "cut through the mix like {{a laser beam}} through fog." [...] Brown described the [...] "Time" [...] solo as [...] "a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato." [...] Brown described Gilmour's sense of phrasing as intuitive, singling it out as perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: [...] "I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting... singing sustain... you need to play loud — {{at or near the}} feedback threshold. It's just so much more fun to play... when bent notes slice right <b>through</b> <b>you</b> like a razor blade." ...|$|E
500|$|Five {{women of}} Lynnhaven Parish Church {{examined}} Sherwood's naked {{body on the}} shoreline for any devices she might have to free herself, and then covered her with a sack. Six of the justices that had ordered the ducking rowed in one boat [...] out in the river, and in another were the sheriff, the magistrate, and Sherwood. Just before she was pushed off the boat Sherwood {{is said to have}} stated, under clear skies, [...] "Before this day be <b>through</b> <b>you</b> will all get a worse ducking than I." [...] Bound across the body—her right thumb to her left big toe and her left thumb to her right big toe– she was [...] "cast into the river", and quickly floated to the surface. The sheriff then tied a [...] Bible around her neck. This caused her to sink, but she untied herself, and returned to the surface, convincing many spectators she was a witch. As Sherwood was pulled out of the water a downpour reportedly started, drenching the onlookers. Several women who subsequently examined her for additional proof found [...] "two things like titts on her private parts of a black coller [...] ". She was jailed pending further proceedings.|$|E
