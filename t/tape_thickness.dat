5000|$|A VHS {{cassette}} holds {{a maximum}} of about 430 m (1,410 ft.) of tape at the lowest acceptable <b>tape</b> <b>thickness,</b> giving a maximum playing time of about four hours in a T-240/DF480 for NTSC and five hours in an E-300 for PAL at [...] "standard play" [...] (SP) quality.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{processes}} used in manufacturing of multilayer ceramic packages, multilayer capacitors and large scale integration circuits is tape casting. In this process, the wet <b>tape</b> <b>thickness</b> is one of the single most determining parameters affecting the final properties of the product, and it is therefore of great interest to be able to control it. One way to control the <b>tape</b> <b>thickness</b> is to use a two doctor blade configuration in the tape casting machine. In this case, it becomes important to fix the height of the slurry in front of both doctor blades according to the desired <b>tape</b> <b>thickness</b> and casting speed (belt velocity). In the present work, the flow in both doctor blade regions of a slurry is described with a steady state momentum equation in combination with a Bingham plastic constitutive equation, and this is integrated to a closed form analytical solution for both reservoirs based on the desired wet <b>tape</b> <b>thickness</b> and casting speed.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the superconducting (SC) wire windings of the mini-pole superconducting undulator at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) has improved. A precise measurement of the magnetic field was undertaken to examine {{the quality of the}} wire winding. We improved the insulation between the wires and the iron pole to avoid degradation of the SC wire when the coil was trained to a large current. A coating (Teflon, layer thickness 0. 045 r 0. 02 mm) on the iron pole is capable of providing insulation to 0. 5 kV. We pasted extra <b>tape</b> (Teflon, <b>thickness</b> 0. 12 mm) on the coating layer; this tape serves as a buffer that prevents the SC wires scraping the coating layer during adjustment of the position of the SC wire during winding. A quenching experiment was performed to measure the tolerance of the coil during extra heating of the beam duct; a heater (Ni 80 Cr 20) simulated the heating of that duct with synchrotron radiation. The coil and heater were separated with <b>tape</b> (Kapton, <b>thickness</b> 0. 3 mm), stainless steel (SS, 316 L), beam duct (thickness 0. 3 mm), Al foil (thickness 0. 1 mm) and an epoxy layer.

The system was designed to incorporate several advantages over traditional, ceramic characterization routes: (i) the system functions as an area detector (rather than a conventional point- or line-detector) providing rapid, statistical information on inhomogeneities in tape microstructures; (ii) it is capable of detecting small pores and surface pits on the order of 10 microns in size; (iii) it can also detect <b>tape</b> <b>thickness</b> variations on the order of 10 microns; (iv) it is capable of tracking these heterogeneities as a function of time and position throughout casting, debinding, and sintering; and (v) using standard equipment, it is amenable to scale up for quantitative process control and monitoring in an industrial setting. The prototype involved magnification radiography using a microfocus x-ray generator, digitization of the radiographs using a 14 -bit CCD camera, and image processing of the digitized radiographs.

In this paper, we report on the experimental investigation of commercially available cobalt-based amorphous alloys which, in their processing, were subjected to two different types of magnetic field anneals: A longitudinal magnetic field anneal or a transverse magnetic field anneal. The longitudinal field annealed material investigated was Metglas 2714 A. The electrical and magnetic characteristics of this material were investigated over the frequency range of 1 to 200 kHz and temperature range of 23 to 150 C for both sine and square wave voltage excitation. The specific core loss was lower for the square than the sine wave voltage excitation for the same maximum flux density, frequency and temperature. The transverse magnetic field annealed core materials include Metglas 2714 AF and Vacuumschmelze 6025 F. These two materials were experimentally characterized over the frequency range of 10 to 200 kHz for sine wave voltage excitation and 23 C only. A comparison of the 2174 A to 2714 AF found that 2714 AF always had lower specific core loss than 2714 A for any given magnetic flux density and frequency and the ratio of specific core loss of 2714 A to 2714 AF was dependent on both magnetic flux density and frequency. A comparison was also made of the 2714 A, 2714 AF, and 6025 F materials to two different <b>tape</b> <b>thicknesses</b> of the polycrystalline Supermalloy material and the results show that 2714 AF and 6025 F have the lowest specific core loss at 100 kHz over the magnetic flux density range of 0. 1 to 0. 4 Tesla...|$|R
