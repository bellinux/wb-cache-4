5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1988, the band started rehearsing material for a new album with producer André Jacquemin, who had worked on all the Monty Python’s records. The album Take a Bite was published by GWR in October 1988 and follows in the steps of Nightmare at Maple Cross, presenting powerful and melodic metal songs, tinged with the humour typical of the band. To promote the album, Girlschool did a UK tour with Gary Glitter, followed by a North American tour. In 1989, they travelled across Europe with Dio and to the Soviet Union with Black Sabbath, {{till the end of}} the year. After their return from Russia, GWR did not renew their contract and the band practically broke up. Musical tastes were changing worldwide in favour of grunge and more extreme metal genres, compelling most acts originated from the new wave of British heavy metal to disband or to reduce their activities, and the same <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Girlschool.|$|E
25|$|Mrs Oliver now {{contacts}} Mark {{with a key}} {{connection that}} she has made: another victim of the Pale Horse (Mary Delafontaine) has lost her hair during her illness. The same <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Lady Hesketh-Dubois, and Thomasina's hair was easily pulled out during the fight. Moreover, Ginger has begun to shed her own hair. Mark recognises that these are symptoms, not of satanic assassination of some sort, but of thallium poisoning.|$|E

Using its shift to perfection, Wycoff {{eventually}} got over the tying touchdown. After a fumble recovery, an 80-yard drive utilizing Wycoff and Sam Murray ended in a Carter Barron touchdown for the third score. After an interception, Ike Williams also added a 25-yard field goal.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Christman {{was engaged}} in {{traveling}} around the world lecturing about Scientology and gave media interviews about the subject. In his 2008 book , author Andrew Morton thanked Christman in the acknowledgements section for advising him {{with regard to the}} jargon and complicated history of Scientology. In February 2008, Christman appeared on the National Public Radio program Morning Edition in a piece about the protest movement against Scientology called Project Chanology started by the Internet-based group Anonymous; she said she objected to any illegal methods used, but appreciated new activists taking part in criticizing Scientology. Along with Scientology critic Mark Bunker, she took part in the international protests against the organization in 2008 as part of Project Chanology. Christman maintains an account on YouTube with the identification [...] "ToryMagoo44", where she posts topically about Scientology. Her YouTube account was briefly shut down in April 2008 around the time period that the same <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Mark Bunker; soon afterwards an unidentified individual posted to alt.religion.scientology and boasted of [...] "silencing" [...] Christman. Christman resided in Los Angeles in 2009. The Sunday Times characterized Christman in a 2009 article as [...] "a fierce critic of the church".|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} that Coon got in touch, Gerrold had just been {{employed}} at CBS as a typist working on scripts such as the pilot of Hawaii Five-O. As {{soon as he got}} the response, he quit the job. Gerrold and Coon met once more, and revealed that the network had recently made a request for more episodes based on other planets. Coon told Gerrold to work up a further pitch. This version of the story added the Klingons, and moved the action from planetside to a space station. During a visit to the set, Gerrold had the opportunity to speak to Leonard Nimoy and ask his advice on how to write for Spock and was allowed to watch the dailies from each day's shoot of the episode [...] "" [...] which was being filmed at the time. This version of the story was entitled [...] "A Fuzzy <b>Thing</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> Me...", which was purchased by Coon as a plot outline. He offered Gerrold a chance to write the script himself, by promising not to hand it to another writer for a month. However, Coon {{made it clear that he}} was not offering Gerrold a script assignment, but was giving him the option of submitting a draft.|$|E

500|$|In the {{subsequent}} decade, two pioneers {{of the style}} became increasingly commercially viable. According to Nielsen Soundscan, Napalm Death sold 367,654 units between May 1991 and November 2003, while Carcass sold 220,374 units in the same period. The inclusion of Napalm Death's [...] "Twist the Knife (Slowly)" [...] on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility, as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the Billboard 200 chart and went platinum {{in less than a}} year.< The originators of the style have expressed some ambivalence regarding {{the subsequent}} popularity of grindcore. Pete Hurley, the guitarist of Extreme Noise Terror, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: [...] "'grindcore' was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and {{it had nothing to do}} with us whatsoever. ENT were, are, and - I suspect - always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you can come up with." [...] Lee Dorian of Napalm Death indicated that [...] "Unfortunately, I think the same <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> grindcore, if you want to call it that, as happened to punk rock - all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{she struggles}} with her condition, doctors suggest to Karl that {{going back to}} {{familiar}} surroundings may trigger the return of her memories. Susan is brought to Ramsay Street, but nothing happens. Woodburne stated that Susan hates her hair and her clothes and wants to change everything. Karl takes her to Lyn Scully's salon and manages to persuade her to have her hair styled rather than cut short. While she is at the salon, Susan remembers her high school sweetheart, Craig Benson (Tim Hughes), and decides to find him. [...] Woodburne told Herbison [...] "As far as she's concerned, Craig is her boyfriend and they're in love. So she looks {{him up in the}} phone book and sets off to find him." [...] Woodburne added that there was a danger the storyline could cross a line and become silly, but the crew tried to portray the fear a person would feel when everything is suddenly unfamiliar. Susan falls in love with Karl and her memories return during their vow renewal service. During a 2012 interview, Woodburne told a What's on TV reporter that she and the writers initially joked about the storyline, but they found some truth in it. She explained [...] "It was actually based on a story of a woman who lived in England. The same <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> her. She fell over in a supermarket. Between leaving the supermarket and getting home, she'd lost 30 years. I don't think she recovered. She had a husband and grown-up children and she had no idea who they were. Imagine the terror and the fear of being surrounded by these people who tell you that they are your family. But you feel nothing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The fifth premise, [...] "The Fuzzies", {{was also}} {{initially}} rejected by Coon, but a while later {{he changed his}} mind and called Gerrold's agent to accept it. Gerrold then expanded the story to a full television story outline entitled [...] "A Fuzzy <b>Thing</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>To</b> Me…", and it eventually became [...] "The Trouble With Tribbles". The name [...] "Fuzzy" [...] was changed because H. Beam Piper had written novels about a fictional alien species of the same name (see Little Fuzzy). The script went through numerous rewrites, including, at the insistence of Gerrold's agent, being re-set in a stock frontier town instead of an [...] "expensive" [...] space station. Gerrold later wrote a book, The Trouble With Tribbles, telling the whole story about producing the episode and his earlier premises.|$|E

After the same <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Edgar Willsher's benefit match, Grace took a select team to play Kent a few days later, the proceeds all going to Willsher. On another occasion, he altered the date of a Gloucestershire match {{so that he could}} travel to Sheffield and take part in a Yorkshire player's benefit match, knowing full well the impact that his appearance would have on the gate.

2500|$|From early on, {{the club}} {{witnessed}} {{instability in the}} coaching situation. On its third attempt to get a long-serving coach did the club succeed, but Kristinn Atlason was swapped for player-coach Vegard Hansen ahead of the 2004 season. He left in 2005 after the club failed to pay him; the same <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> his successor Jonas Jonsson. The club then went through two more coaches and had just hired another when becoming defunct. The financial situation was dire throughout the club's existence, despite investments from Simonsen and Løvvik, and culminated in the lack of pay in 2005 and early 2006. Especially the sponsor attraction was lower than some had predicted. An attempt in 2006 to change ownership and club name did not help enough, and the club was even relegated. After this {{it was decided to}} give up, and to revert to the mother club Stord IL; the chairman of the club owners explained that Stord Sunnhordland had [...] "been a club without soul".|$|E

The check to the 16th Division left German machine-gunners north of the railway free to enfilade the area of 8th Division to the south.
