Meyer, appeared on the Fox News show <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Story</b> with John Gibson, where he debated Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education. There Meyer sought to convey the Institute's message that debate over evolution is not a ploy to get religious ideas into public schools, that evolution is a theory in crisis, and that students were currently being taught in error there was no scientific controversy over evolution.|$|E
25|$|Lauda's {{injuries}} {{kept him}} out of the following two races, allowing Hunt to close the gap in the championship chase. At Zandvoort, Hunt overtook Ronnie Peterson on the 12th lap and resisted pressure from John Watson to win. At the Italian Grand Prix, <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>story</b> was Lauda's miraculous return from his Nürburgring accident. At a circuit that should have suited Hunt's car, the Texaco fuel McLaren were using was tested and although apparently legal, their cars, and those of the Penske team, were judged to contain a higher octane level than allowed. Subsequently, both teams were forced to start {{from the rear of the}} grid. While trying to make his way up the field, Hunt spun off, while a returning Lauda finished fourth. At the next round in Canada, Hunt found out that he had been disqualified from the British Grand Prix and Lauda had been awarded the victory and thus received three additional points. A furious Hunt drove a very hard race at the challenging Mosport Park circuit and won. And at the penultimate round in the United States at the daunting Watkins Glen track, Hunt started from pole and took victory after a close battle with Jody Scheckter.|$|E
500|$|Maulbetsch's {{breakthrough}} came on October 31, 1914, {{in front}} of 30,000fans at Harvard. [...] The game {{was one of the}} most anticipated matches of the year. [...] A special train brought Michigan fans to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and hundreds of Michigan alumni from the East were on hand as [...] "reinforcements." [...] Though Harvard prevailed, 7–0, Maulbetsch was <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>story</b> in papers across the country. [...] Writers from Ring Lardner to Damon Runyon told the story of Maulbetsch's performance. [...] Lardner said: [...] "If anyone tells you the East plays the best brand of football, Maulbetsch shot that theory full of holes." [...] According to Runyon, the Wolverines used [...] "the mighty Maulbetsch as their battering ram", and he [...] "gained enough ground against Harvard to bury a German army corps." [...] Football writer Frank G. Menke said: [...] "No westerner ever created half the stir in the east as did this Michigander [...] [...] [...] His peculiar, baffling style of attack, backed by phenomenal strength almost always earned for him gains of 5 to 20yards every time he was called upon to carry the ball." [...] Another writer noted Maulbetsch's skill as a [...] "line breaker" [...] as he [...] "carried the ball repeatedly through the Harvard line and into the secondary defense with bullet-like rushes that upset tackler after tackler." [...] Maulbetsch was responsible for four-fifths of Michigan's ground gains, and on several occasions his dives reportedly [...] "had so much power that he dove right through a double line of crimson players and went sprawling on the ground twelve to twenty feet clear of the double line." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>story.</b> That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E

2500|$|The storyline {{was created}} {{during one of}} four {{planning}} meetings that are held during the year, in which the crew plot out all <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>story</b> arcs.
