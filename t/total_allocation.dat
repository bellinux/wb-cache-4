In that same period, Sestak raised only $758,000, about a quarter million dollars lower than the previous quarter, making his <b>total</b> <b>allocation</b> about $4.7 million. Sestak continued working hard to overcome his name recognition problem, seldom turning down interview requests and asking his staff to work six 12-hour days a week. As a result, Sestak saw a large amount of turnover in his staff, going through nearly half a dozen press secretaries and several chiefs of staff. Sestak called on Specter participate in six debates, one for each media market in Pennsylvania, but Specter only agreed to participate in one because that was the amount of debates he participated in as a Republican. On December 7, Sestak was endorsed by Congressman Barney Frank, who said that he was impressed by Sestak's leadership on economic and military issues, as well as his positions against the military's [...] "don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy and the Defense of Marriage Act. The endorsement was important to Sestak {{because it was the first}} time a prominent member of Congress broke with the Democratic establishment to back him over Specter. Frank also said of Specter's switching parties, [...] "I have to say I don't think it did our profession any good for someone to announce that he switched parties purely so he could survive." ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{concerns}} have intensified {{due to the}} actions of China, the predominant supplier. [...] Specifically, China has announced regulations on exports and a crackdown on smuggling. On September 1, 2009, China announced plans to reduce its export quota to 35,000 tons per year in 2010–2015 to conserve scarce resources and protect the environment. On October 19, 2010, China Daily, citing an unnamed Ministry of Commerce official, reported that China will [...] "further reduce quotas for rareearth exports by 30 percent at most next year to protect the precious metals from over-exploitation". The government in Beijing further increased its control by forcing smaller, independent miners to merge into state-owned corporations or face closure. At the end of 2010, China announced that {{the first round of}} export quotas in 2011 for rare earths would be 14,446 tons, which was a 35% decrease from the previous first round of quotas in 2010. China announced further export quotas on 14 July 2011 for {{the second half of the}} year with <b>total</b> <b>allocation</b> at 30,184 tons with total production capped at 93,800 tonnes. In September 2011, China announced the halt in production of three of its eight major rare-earth mines, responsible for almost 40% of China's total rare-earth production. In March 2012, the US, EU, and Japan confronted China at WTO about these export and production restrictions. China responded with claims that the restrictions had environmental protection in mind. In August 2012, China announced a further 20% reduction in production. These restrictions have damaged industries in other countries and forced producers of rare-earth products to relocate their operations to China. The Chinese restrictions on supply failed in 2012, as prices dropped in response to the opening of other sources. The price of dysprosium oxide was 994USD/kg in 2011, but dropped to 265USD/kg by 2014.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I examine the {{relationship}} between Pareto-optimality and group size in linear public goods games or experiments. In particular, I use the standard setting of homogeneous linear public goods experiments and apply a recently developed tool to identify all Pareto-optimal allocations in such settings. It turns out that under any conceivable circumstances, ceteris paribus, small groups have a higher Pareto-ratio (Pareto-optimal <b>allocations</b> over <b>total</b> <b>allocations)</b> than large groups. Hence, if Pareto-optimality of an allocation is a property that makes such allocations acceptable and maintainable, small groups will find is easier to provide Pareto-optimal amounts of a public good than large groups. This is a novel reasoning for Mancur Olson's claim, in particular, with respect to what he has termed inclusive goods and inclusive groups.

50|$|Regional OperationsRegional {{transport}} {{is considered}} as a major pillar {{in the process of}} regional integration since it facilitates setting up binds amongst African countries and between Africa and the Arab World. Moreover, this connection has a positive impact on the African continent promotion, by contributing to the expansion of the circle of commercial exchange, facilitating easy circulation of products between African countries as well as transportation inside and outside countries. It will also contribute to the extension of markets, creating regional or continental markets for both goods and services, and therefore achieve development in Africa.In this regard, the <b>total</b> <b>allocations</b> for financing regional operations during the period 1975-2013 amounted to US$537.7 million, directed to finance 66 regional projects, and US$7.69 million to finance 25 technical and economic feasibility studies as grants, some of which produced projects financed by BADEA.|$|R

We apply this framework to study the horizon effects in the allocations of equity-only investors, who hold a mix of value and growth indices, and a more general investor, who also has access to Treasury bills and bonds. We find that the mean allocation of equity-only investors is heavily tilted towards value stocks at short-horizons, but {{the magnitude of this}} tilt declines dramatically with the investment horizon, implying that growth is less risky than value at long horizons.
