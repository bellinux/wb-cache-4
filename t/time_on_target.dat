25|$|In {{a fierce}} battle lasting 10 days, the American and German lines were often confused. During {{the first three}} days, the battle raged over the twin villages of Rocherath-Krinkelt, during which American G.I.s were at times {{isolated}} in individual buildings surrounded by German armor. Attacking Elsenborn Ridge itself, the Germans, although superior in numbers, were stopped by the Americans' well-prepared and deeply dug-in defensive positions. The German attack plans were not well coordinated and frustrated by the rugged terrain, built-up areas around the twin villages, and massed American artillery firepower positioned behind Elsenborn Ridge. American artillery batteries repeatedly pounded the German advance. While the Germans employed an effective combined arms tactic and penetrated the U.S. lines several times, the Americans called in indirect fire on their own positions, pushing the Germans back. U.S. reserve forces consisting of clerks and headquarters personnel were rushed in at one point to reinforce the 395th Infantry Regiment's lines. Although the Germans possessed superior armor, they were held in check by the innovative American tactics, including better communications, coordinated <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>target</b> artillery strikes, new proximity fuses for artillery shells, and superior air power.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} explored how various {{methods of}} learning a task {{can affect the}} degree of flexibility found if the task is changed following acquisition. Two experiments examined flexibility in children (aged 3 1 / 2 - 5 1 / 2) with a cooperative puzzle-making task. Study 1 employed two forms of acquisition, instruction plus feedback and feedback only, to increase <b>time</b> spent <b>on</b> the <b>target</b> activity (cooperative play). Once an increase in <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the <b>target</b> was obtained, positive feedback was made contingent <b>on</b> a different <b>target</b> activity (individual play). The results suggested that an initial history of instructional learning produces responding that is slower to adapt when contingencies are changed, but all children were eventually able to adapt their responding to the changed goals of the task. Study 2 employed the same two forms of acquisition, instruction plus feedback and feedback only, to increase cooperative play. Once an increase occurred the feedback was removed and instructions were changed or added {{to increase the amount}} of <b>time</b> spent <b>on</b> the <b>target</b> activity (individual play). Results of Study 2 generally paralleled those of Study 1, in that regardless of acquisition or age all children spent large percentages of the experimental sessions <b>on</b> the <b>target</b> activity during acquisition and all subjects adapted to later changed task goals.

40|$|Abstract One {{critical}} {{question for the}} front end of models of visual-word recognition and reading is whether the stage of letter position coding is purely orthographic or whether phonology is (to some degree) involved. To explore this issue, we conducted a silent reading experiment in Japanese Kana—a script in which orthography and phonology can be easily separated—using a technique that is highly sensitive to phonological effects (i. e., Rayner’s (1975) boundary technique). Results showed shorter fixation <b>times</b> <b>on</b> the <b>target</b> word when the parafoveal preview was a transposed-mora nonword (a. ri. me. ka [アリメカ]–a. me. ri. ka [アメリカ]) than when the preview was a replacement-mora nonword (a. ka. ho. ka [アカホカ] –a. me. ri. ka [アメリカ]). More critically, fixation <b>times</b> <b>on</b> the <b>target</b> word were remarkably similar when the parafoveal preview was a transposed-consonant nonword (a. re. mi. ka [アレミカ]–a. ri. me. ka [アリメカ]) and when the parafoveal preview was an orthographic control nonword (a. ke. hi. ka [アケヒカ]–a. me. ri. ka [アメリカ]). Thus, these findings offer strong support for the view that letter/mora position coding during silent reading is orthographic in nature...|$|R
40|$|Covariance {{analysis}} {{of the performance of}} the Geoscience Laser Ranging System (GLRS) indicates that three-dimensional relative positions can be recovered to an accuracy of several millimeters over spatial scales from a few kilometers to several hundred kilometers and over temporal scales as short as several days. The key factors influencing the accuracy are range noise, number of targets and their locations, system pointing capability, dwell <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the <b>targets,</b> orbital geometry, and gravity field uncertainties. Based on the present trade-off studies, GLRS is designed to provide range measurements with 10 mm or better accuracy, fire at a rate of 40 pulses-per-second, point over a cone extending to 50 deg from nadir, and operate with a dwell <b>time</b> <b>on</b> individual <b>targets</b> of 2 s or less.

40|$|The {{application}} of network centric operations principles to human supervisory control (HSC) domains means {{that humans are}} increasingly being asked to manage multiple simultaneous HSC processes. However, increases {{in the number of}} available infor-mation sources, volume of information and operational tempo, all which place higher cognitive demands on operators, could become constraints limiting the success of net-work centric processes. In time-pressured scenarios typical of networked command and control scenarios, efficiently allocating attention between a set of dynamic tasks is crucial for mission success. Inefficient attention allocation leads to system wait times, which could eventually lead to critical events such as missed <b>times</b> <b>on</b> <b>targets</b> and degraded overall mission success. One potential solution to mitigating wait times is the introduction of automated decision support in order to relieve operator work-load. However, it is not obvious what automated decision support is appropriate, as higher levels of automation may result in a situation awareness decrement and other problems typically associated with excessive automation such as automation bias...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{questions}} {{asked in the}} present experiments concern the generality of semantic and phonological priming effects: Do these effects arise automatically regardless of target task, or are these effects restricted to target tasks that specifically require the retrieval of the primed information? In Experiment 1, subjects produced faster color matching <b>times</b> <b>on</b> <b>targets</b> preceded by a masked rhyming prime than <b>on</b> <b>targets</b> preceded by an orthographic control or an unrelated prime. This result suggests that automatic priming effects {{on the basis of}} phonological similarity can be obtained even when the target task does not make use of phonological information. This claim was reinforced in Experiment 2 in which a rhyme priming effect and a semantic priming effect were found in a semantic categorization task. In Experiment 3, the target task was phonological (rhyme detection), and, again, both phonological and semantic priming effects were observed. Finally, in Experiments 4 and 5, in a replication and an extension of Experiment 1, phonological and semantic priming effects were found in a color matching task, a task involving neither phonological nor semantic processing. These results are most straightforwardly interpreted by assuming that both semantic and phonological priming effects are, at least in part, due to automatic activation of memorial representations...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the roles}} that unintentional or unaware {{processing}} play in human learning of probabilistic relationships {{has important implications for}} the understanding of unconscious information processing and implicit learning. The current research explores some of these differences between intentional and unintentional processing by employing a visual search task which has been used to demonstrate implicit learning. This task involves a relatively subtle probabilistic relationship between nontarget stimuli and target presence. The type of processing in which participants engaged while performing this task was influenced by manipulating the complexity and accuracy of explicit instructions about the relationship between target presence and “nontarget background structure”. Participants in the implicit (uninstructed) conditions showed the expected patterns of sensitivity to the structure without accompanying verbalizeable knowledge to that structure. Participants who were instructed about the nontarget structure also showed sensitivity to the underlying structure. However, instructed participants initially had slower reaction times to target present trials. After practice, those who were accurately instructed appeared to shift their response criteria such that they were more willing to quickly make a target absent judgement. This led to faster reaction <b>times</b> <b>on</b> <b>target</b> absent trials, and more errors <b>on</b> <b>target</b> present trials. Intention to use the provided instructions was correlated with reaction time to target absent trials, while awareness of the structure was correlated with errors to target present trials. ...|$|R
