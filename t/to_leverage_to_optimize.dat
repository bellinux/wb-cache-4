40|$|International audienceWith {{increasing}} {{scale and}} complexity of supercomputing and cloud computing architectures, faults are becoming a frequent occurrence. For a large class of applications that run {{for a long time}} and are tightly coupled, Checkpoint-Restart (CR) is the only feasible method to survive failures. However, exploding checkpoint sizes that need to be dumped to storage pose a major scalability challenge, prompting the need to reduce the amount of checkpointing data. This paper contributes with a novel collective memory contents deduplication scheme that attempts to identify and eliminate duplicate memory pages before they are saved to storage. Unlike previous approaches that concentrate on the checkpoints of the same process, our approach identifies duplicate memory pages shared by different processes (regardless whether on the same or different node). We show both how to achieve such a global deduplication in a scalable fashion and how <b>to</b> <b>leverage</b> it effectively <b>to</b> <b>optimize</b> the data layout in such way that it minimizes I/O bottlenecks. Large scale experiments show significant reduction of storage space consumption and performance overhead compared to several state-of-art approaches, both in synthetic benchmarks and for a real life high performance computing application...|$|R

40|$|MAOMoVTe(Sb) NbO {{catalysts}} {{have been}} prepared using the slurry method and tested as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The influence of both the addition of silica to the starting slurry during the preparation and of a final heat treatment under nitrogen at 873 K after {{the dissolution of the}} M 2 phase formed concomitantly to the active M 1 active phase has been studied. While the parameters change the texture of the catalysts without modification of the catalytic sites, they have opposite effects on catalytic properties. The addition of silica increases the conversion without modifying the selectivity to ethylene and the final heat treatment decreases the conversion but increases the selectivity. These effects have been explained respectively by a decrease of the agglomeration and sintering of the M 1 phase crystallites and a decrease of the number of small pores, where total oxidation takes place. These effects could be <b>leveraged</b> <b>to</b> <b>optimize</b> the preparation protocol and obtain more efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{presents}} a comprehensive physical layer design and modeling platform for silicon photonic interconnects. The platform {{is based on}} explicit, closed-form expressions for optical power penalties, derived for both signal-dependent and signal-independent noise contexts. Our models agree well with reported experimental measurements. We show how the modeling approach {{is used for the}} design space exploration of silicon photonic links and can be <b>leveraged</b> <b>to</b> <b>optimize</b> the wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) capacity, evaluate the scalability, and study the sensitivity of the system to key device parameters. We apply the methodology to the design of microring-based silicon photonic links, including an evaluation of the impairments associated with cascaded ring modulators, as well as the spectral distortion and crosstalk effects of demultiplexer ring arrays for non-return-to-zero (NRZ) on-off keying (OOK) modulated WDM signals. We show that the total capacity of a chip-to-chip microring-based WDM silicon photonic link designed with recently reported interconnect device parameters, can approach 2 Tb/s realized with NRZ-OOK data modulation and 45 wave-lengths each modulated at 45 Gb/s.

40|$|Some {{instructions}} {{have more}} impact on processor performance than others. Identification of these critical instructions {{can be used}} to modify and improve instruction processing. Previous work has shown that the criticality of instructions can be dynamically predicted with high accuracy, and that this information can be <b>leveraged</b> <b>to</b> <b>optimize</b> the performance of load value prediction and instruction steering for clustered architectures. In this work, we revisit the idea of criticality, but we propose several processor enhancements that can exploit criticality information and can be directly applied to modern x 86 microarchitectures. For the investment of a small (less than 1 KB) criticality predictor, we can make a conventional single-read-port data cache achieve the performance of an ideal dual-read-port cache, yielding an average 10 % performance improvement. Our remaining techniques can reuse the predictor (i. e., no additional overhead) <b>to</b> further <b>optimize</b> other aspects of load processing (e. g., caching decisions, store-to-load forwarding, etc.), yielding an overall performance improvement of 16 % over a conventional processor. Some of these techniques also allow us to decrease power and area costs for several related hardware structures. 1...|$|R

More recently, the findings and methods of neuroscience have been applied to study the process of decision-making in order to offer advanced insights into the neural mechanisms that influence economic and consumer choices. In this thesis, I will address how customized marketing strategies can be enriched through the integration of consumer neuroscience, an integrative field anchored in the biological, cognitive and affective mechanisms of consumer behavior. By recognizing and utilizing these multidisciplinary interdependencies, marketers can enhance their advertising and promotional mix to elicit desired neural and affective consumer responses and measure these reactions {{in order to enhance}} purchasing decisions. The principal objective of this thesis is to present a comprehensive review of consumer neuroscience and to elucidate why it is an increasingly important area of study within the framework of human behavior. I will also describe how the insights gained from this emerging field can be <b>leveraged</b> <b>to</b> <b>optimize</b> marketing activities. Finally, I propose an experiment that illuminates key research questions, which may have considerable impact on the discipline of consumer neuroscience as well as the marketing industry...|$|R
40|$|Complexity in {{clinical}} workflows {{can lead to}} inefficiency in making diagnoses, ineffectiveness of treatment plans and uninformed management of healthcare organizations (HCOs). Traditional strategies to manage workflow complexity are based on measuring the gaps between workflows defined by HCO administrators and the actual processes followed by staff in the clinic. However, existing methods tend to neglect the influences of EMR systems on the utilization of workflows, which could be <b>leveraged</b> <b>to</b> <b>optimize</b> workflows facilitated through the EMR. In this paper, we introduce a framework to infer clinical workflows through the utilization of an EMR and show how such workflows roughly partition into four types according to their efficiency. Our framework infers workflows at several levels of granularity through data mining technologies. We study four months of EMR event logs from a large medical center, including 16, 569 inpatient stays, and illustrate that over approximately 95 % of workflows are efficient and that 80 % of patients are on such workflows. At the same time, we show that the remaining 5 % of workflows may be inefficient due {{to a variety of}} factors, such as complex patients...|$|R

Motivated {{by the need to}} provide an extensible and flexible framework beyond the abstractions provided by API libraries for files to manage and analyze large-scale data, we are developing Damasc, an enhanced file system where rich data management services for scientific computing are provided as a native part of the file system. This paper presents our vision for Damasc, a performant file system that would allow scientists or even casual users to pose declarative queries and updates over views of underlying files that are stored in their native bytestream format. In Damasc, a configurable layer is added on top of the file system to expose the contents of files in a logical data model through which views can be defined and used for queries and updates. The logical data model and views are <b>leveraged</b> <b>to</b> <b>optimize</b> access <b>to</b> files through caching and selforganizing indexing. In addition, provenance capture and analysis to file access is also built into Damasc. We describe the salient features of our proposal and discuss how it can benefit the development of scientific code. 1...|$|R
