5000|$|Like [...] "Surrender," [...] "Auf Wiedersehen" [...] {{was one of}} {{the earlier}} songs in Cheap Trick's repertory, and a version was {{originally}} recorded for the band's eponymous debut album. [...] It is a powerful, vital song. [...] Beaujour describes it as [...] "a furious hard rocker." [...] Music critic John Serba describes it as one of his favorite Cheap Trick songs, being [...] "one of their heaviest tunes, dark, gritty, punky, but still catchy as hell." [...] Some of the music quotes lines from Bob Dylan's [...] "All Along the Watchtower". [...] Wawzenek comments that the song requires a [...] "Broadway caliber performance" [...] from Cheap <b>Trick</b> <b>lead</b> singer Robin Zander to pull it off, and the song is one of Zander's favorites. [...] Wawzenek praised Zander's [...] "murderous howl" [...] on the [...] "most blood-curdling" [...] moments of the song such as at the words [...] "No Hope!" [...] Nielsen sometimes plays part of the song on a 5-neck guitar. [...] Heaven Tonight producer Tom Werman feels that despite his slick production, the subject matter of [...] "Auf Wiedersehen" [...] validated the band's new wave credentials. [...] Bradley Bambarger of Billboard described the song as being [...] "punkier than thou." [...] But Gary Graff wrote for MusicHound that [...] "Auf Wiedersehen" [...] is an [...] "overbearing rocker." ...|$|E
