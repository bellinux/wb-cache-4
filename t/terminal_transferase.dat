TdT adds N-nucleotides to the V, D, and J exons of the TCR and BCR genes during antibody gene recombination, enabling the phenomenon of junctional diversity. In humans, <b>terminal</b> <b>transferase</b> is encoded by the DNTT gene.

Studies using TdT knockout mice have found drastic reductions (10-fold) in T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity compared with that of normal, or wild-type, systems. The greater diversity of TCRs that an organism is equipped with leads to greater resistance to infection.|$|E

40|$|Hair {{plucking}} is {{the most}} frequently used method of anagen induction within hair follicles. In this study, we found that plucking leads to the entire renewal of the follicular stem cell region of the mouse pelage follicle. Comparative histochemical analysis revealed that S 100 A 4 protein was specifically distributed in the outer layer of the epithelial sac, which has been identified as the stem cell region of the pelage follicle, whereas the slow cycling cells that retained 5 -bromo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine label for 8 wk were located in the epithelial sac and also in the hair germ. Combined <b>terminal</b> deoxynucleotide <b>transferase</b> deoxyuridine triphosphate fluorescein nick end labeling method and immunohistochemistry revealed that positive cells were detected in the outer layer of the epithelial sac possessing both bromo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine and S 100 A 4 labels 4. 5 h after plucking.

50|$|The TA TOPO cloning {{technique}} {{relies on}} the ability of adenine (A) and thymine (T) (complementary basepairs) on different DNA fragments to hybridize and, in the presence of ligase or topoisomerase, become ligated together. The insert is created by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase, a polymerase that lacks 3' to 5' proofreading activity and with a high probability adds a single, 3'-adenine overhang to each end of the PCR product. It is best if the PCR primers have guanines at the 5' end as this maximizes probability of Taq DNA polymerase adding the terminal adenosine overhang. Thermostable polymerases containing extensive 3´ to 5´ exonuclease activity should not be used as they do not leave the 3´ adenine-overhangs.The target vector is linearized and cut with a blunt-end restriction enzyme. This vector is then tailed with dideoxythymidine triphosphate (ddTTP) using <b>terminal</b> <b>transferase.</b> It is important to use ddTTP to ensure the addition of only one T residue.

50|$|DNA {{samples are}} hybridized to a primer immobilized on a flow cell for sequencing, {{so it is}} usually {{necessary}} to generate a nucleic acid with an end compatible for hybridization to those surfaces. The target sequence attached to the flow cell surface could, in theory, be any sequence which can be synthesized, but, in practice, the standard commercially available flow cell is oligo(dT)50. To be compatible with the oligo(dT)50 primer on the flow cell surface, {{it is necessary to}} generate a poly(dA) tail of at least 50 nt at the 3’ end of the molecule to be sequenced. Because the fill and lock step will fill in excess A’s but not excess T’s, it is desirable for the A tail to be at least as long as oligo(dT) on the surface. Generation of a 3’ poly(dA) tail can be accomplished with a variety of different ligases or polymerases. If there is sufficient DNA to measure both mass and average length, it is possible to determine the proper amount of dATP to be added to generate poly(dA) tails 90 to 200 nucleotides long. To generate tails of this length, it is first necessary to estimate how many 3’ ends there are in the sample and then use the right ratio of DNA, dATP, and <b>terminal</b> <b>transferase</b> to obtain the optimal size range of tails.|$|E
5000|$|... cDNA cloning {{is a major}} {{technology}} for analysis of the expression of genomes. The full-length first-strand can be synthesized through the commercially available reverse transcriptases. Synthesis of the second-strand was once a major limitation to cDNA cloning. Two groups of methods differing by the mechanism of initiation were developed to synthesize the second-strand. In a first group of methods, initiation of second-strand synthesis takes place within the sequence of the first strand. However, the digestion of the 3' {{end of the first}} strand is required and therefore results in the loss of the sequences corresponding to the 5'end of the mRNA. In a second group of methods, initiation of second-strand synthesis takes place outside the sequence of the first strand. This group of methods does not require digestion of the 3' end of the first strand. However, the limitation of this group of method lies upon the elongation. Cloning with T7 DNA polymerase helps overcome this limitation by allowing digestion of the poly(dT) tract during the second-strand synthesis reaction. Therefore, the size of the tract synthesized with <b>terminal</b> <b>transferase</b> is not required to be within a given size range and the resulting clones contain a tract of a limited size. Moreover, due to high 3’ exonuclease activity of T7 DNA polymerase, high yield of the full-length second-strand can be obtained.|$|E

In contrast to previous in vitro results, both TdtS and TdtL are translocated to the nucleus in our model. Furthermore, TdtL/TdtS double Tg mice exhibit less N addition in fetal liver than do TdtS Tg mice. Whereas the TdtS transgene was shown to have functional consequences on the antiphosphorylcholine (PC) B cell repertoire, TdtL Tg mice exhibit a normal PC response, and Tdt �/ � mice actually exhibit an increase in the PC response and in TEPC 15 idiotype � Ab production.
