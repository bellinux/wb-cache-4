5|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} were affected by inability to reach their premises even where the premises themselves were largely unaffected by the blast. Criticism was expressed by local citizens and the local MP that originally <b>the</b> <b>depot</b> had been constructed away from other buildings, but that developmental pressures had led to both houses and commercial premises being built near <b>the</b> <b>depot.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2000/01, {{the track}} towards Portishead were relaid to allow rail access to Royal Portbury Docks. In 2010, another section of track was {{reinstated}} {{to allow the}} reopening of South Liberty Lane depot to handle Trans Ocean's wine import business, reducing road traffic. Seven trains terminate at <b>the</b> <b>depot</b> every week. <b>The</b> <b>depot</b> had closed in 1990 {{due to lack of}} demand for its facilities.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>depot</b> {{was located}} in Sporveisgata, between Bergsliens gate and the street {{junction}} Pilestredet–Sporveisgata. The street Sporveisgata was in the beginning only a branch from Pilestredet, but it became a street {{in its own right}} in 1879, after the tramway installations had been constructed. While it {{was located in}} a branch to Pilestredet, <b>the</b> <b>depot</b> had Pilestredet 75 as its address. After the branch had its name changed to Sporveisgata, the address was renamed Sporveisgata 8.|$|E

All were delivered in British Rail blue and white livery, before being repainted in Network SouthEast white, blue and red livery from 1986. In May 1991, 455743 was renumbered 455750 and renamed Wimbledon Traincare depot in recognition of <b>the</b> <b>depot</b> obtaining BS5750 quality services accreditation.|$|E
5|$|Depot Town {{was created}} after the Ypsilanti Train Depot was opened in 1838. As the {{railroad}} connected Ypsilanti, MI with Detroit, the area surrounding <b>the</b> <b>depot</b> grew. The commercial community known as Depot Town was {{built over the}} thirty years following {{the arrival of the}} railroad, and most of the buildings standing today were built from 1850 to 1880. In the early years, Depot Town included a flour mill, a large farmers' store, an iron foundry, a fire department, a clothing store, and paved streets. Ypsilanti's original city hall and jail were built just across the Huron River from Depot Town on West Cross Street. As <b>the</b> <b>depot</b> was built one mile north of the Chicago Road (now Michigan Avenue), the community of Ypsilanti was split between competing locations.|$|E

5|$|Fitting new {{traction}} equipment both improves Miles per Breakdown values and overall reduces operating and maintenance costs.

5|$|In 1861, the New London Northern Railroad succeeded the New London, Willimantic, and Palmer.

5|$|In 1924, the Air Ministry officially {{separated}} the two sites administratively, so that <b>the</b> <b>depot</b> site and accommodation site (RAF Blenheim Crescent) were considered two separate RAF stations.

5|$|After the nationalization, {{the company}} started a {{renovation}} {{process of the}} infrastructure and rolling stock. Combined with a municipal policy of low fares, the company started going with a loss. Five new trams were delivered from 1948 to 1952, and built at <b>the</b> <b>depot</b> at Holtet, with used equipment {{from some of the}} older trams. An additional nine new trams were delivered between 1952 and 1955. Five additional trams were rebuilt from 1955 to 1960, by which time all the narrow trams had been rebuilt or retired. The use of a unique voltage gave operational difficulties, as fuses could regularly blow at Oslo Hospital if errors were made while switching from the one supply to the other. In addition, all the trams were custom-built with extra equipment with limited spare parts. All the trams delivered during the 1950s were built so they could later be converted to only use 600 volt supply. <b>The</b> <b>depot</b> was expanded in 1952.|$|E
25|$|Below are <b>the</b> <b>depots</b> {{formerly}} {{used by the}} MTA and {{its predecessors}} for municipal bus operations, excluding facilities inherited by the city but not used for city-operated buses. Many of <b>the</b> <b>depots</b> were demolished or abandoned following their closure. Some have been converted for other uses by the MTA or other organizations. One <b>depot,</b> <b>the</b> 54th Street <b>Depot,</b> was demolished {{to make room for}} a new MTA facility outside of bus operations.|$|R

25|$|Some depots were {{targeted}} by thieves – whalers and other ship men who saw <b>the</b> <b>depots</b> {{as a source}} of free food and provisions. To discourage raiding, clothing left at <b>the</b> <b>depots</b> was often distinctively marked, so it could be identified, and warnings were painted on the huts.|$|R
5|$|Between March 1926 and September 1928, the CLR {{converted}} the remaining gate stock carriages in phases. The end platforms were enclosed {{to provide additional}} passenger accommodation and two sliding doors were inserting in each side. The conversions increased capacity and allowed the CLR to remove gatemen from the train crews, with responsibility for controlling doors moving to the two guards who each managed half the train. Finally, the introduction of driver/guard communications in 1928 allowed the CLR to dispense with the second guard, reducing a train crew to just a driver and a guard. The addition of doors in the sides of cars caused problems at Wood Lane where {{the length of the}} platform {{on the inside of the}} returning curve was limited by an adjacent access track into <b>the</b> <b>depot.</b> The problem was solved by the introduction of a pivoted section of platform which usually sat above the access track and allowed passengers to board trains as normal, but which could be moved to allow access to <b>the</b> <b>depot.</b>|$|E

The American vehicles were maintained in a dedicated shed, No. 5.|$|E
