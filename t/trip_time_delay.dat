40|$|Active queue {{management}} schemes like RED (Random Early Detection) {{have been}} suggested when multiple TCP sessions are multiplexed through a bottleneck buffer. The idea is to detect congestion before the buffer overflows and packets are lost. When the queue length reaches a certain threshold RED schemes drop/mark incoming packets with a probability that increases as the queue size increases. The objectives are an equitable distribution of packet loss, reduced delay and delay variation and improved network utilization. Here we model multiple connections maintained in the congestion avoidance regime by the RED mechanism. The window sizes of each TCP session evolve like independent dynamical systems coupled by the queue length at the buffer. We introduce a mean-field approximation to one such RED system {{as the number of}} flows tends to infinity. The deterministic limiting system is described by a transport equation. The numerical solution of the limiting system is found to provide a good description of the evolution of the distribution of the window sizes, the average queue size, the average loss rate per connection and the total throughput. TCP with RED or tail-drop may exhibit limit cycles and this causes unnecessary packet delay variation and variable loss rates. The root cause of these limit cycles is the hysteresis due to the round <b>trip</b> <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> in reacting to a packet loss...|$|E

These approaches should support higher bandwidth, longer distance between end user and network operator, and less energy consumption. Ethernet Passive Optical Network (EPON) is a favorable choice for broadband access networks. EPONs support transmission rates up to 10 Gbps. EPONs also support distance between end users and central office up to 20 Km. Moreover, optical networks have the least energy consumption among all types of networks. In this dissertation, we focus on reducing delay and saving energy in EPONs. Reducing delay is essential for delay-sensitive traffic, while minimizing energy consumption is an environmental necessity and also reduces the network operating costs. We identify five challenges, namely excess bandwidth allocation, frame delineation, congestion resolution, large round <b>trip</b> <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> in long-reach EPONs (LR-EPONs), and energy saving.

These problems can be partly addressed by interconnecting distributed generators (DGs) with the distribution system to supply electric power from renewable energy resources such as photovoltaic (PV), wind, biomass, and fuel cells. One way of integrating a large number of DG sources with the distribution system is to interconnect them with low-voltage (LV) loads to form a microgrid (MG). Multi-microgrids (MMGs) increase the load capacity of the distribution system by integrating several MGs, DGs, and medium-voltage (MV) loads with the distribution system. This chapter discusses a number of challenges in the protection of active distribution systems, MGs, and MMGs. The existing protection schemes and coordination strategies to address these challenges are briefly reviewed in this chapter. This is followed by the presentation of a new protection scheme for MMGs. The existing protection scheme for MMGs originally proposed by the EU More Microgrids Project disconnects all the DG sources when fault conditions occur. As a result, this protection scheme prevents the continued operation of the MMG during fault conditions. The MMG also experiences varying fault current levels due to contributions from DGs and MGs compared to single grid-connected MGs. A new adaptive overcurrent protection scheme for MMGs containing MGs with varying generation and load is proposed in this chapter. It automates the setting of relay characteristics to deal with the variations of generation and load as well as adjust the <b>tripping</b> <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> based on the fault current levels.

The queue bounds can be used to allocate buffers at bottlenecks so that flows can go through without any loss. We modify the AIMD algorithm by making the additive rate increase parameter proportional to the round <b>trip</b> <b>time</b> and the decrease parameter proportional to the power of round <b>trip</b> <b>time</b> which makes the algorithm fair even with heterogenous round <b>trip</b> <b>times.</b> 1 Introduction The presence of <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> in computer networks has made the problem of analysing the performance characteristics of congestion control algorithms a very hard one. In this paper we study the effect of timedelay in the performance characteristics of the Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) algorithm, like queue bound and fairness and suggest measures to improve fairness for both rate based and window based schemes.
