500|$|On 22 July 2009, Kisnorbo {{signed for}} Leeds United on a two-year contract. He made his debut in a 2–1 win over Exeter City on 8 August. On his debut Kisnorbo {{suffered}} a head wound which required stitches, after receiving stitches to the wound off the pitch {{he came out}} wearing a head bandage. After playing for Australia on 12 August, Kisnorbo became Leeds's 100th full international player. Whilst at Leeds he {{established himself as a}} fans' favourite for his solid performances and his brave style of play. After suffering the head injury, which required 12 stitches, Kisnorbo wore a protective headband. He rejected plastic surgery to avoid losing his place in the team: [...] "I can't see myself going for [...] at the moment because I've got bigger <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about than getting this sorted." ...|$|E
500|$|The safety {{concerns}} regarding the LHC collisions have attracted widespread media attention. Various widely circulated newspapers have reported doomsday fears {{in connection with}} the collider, including The Times, The Guardian, The Independent, The Sydney Morning Herald, and Time. Among other media sources, CNN mentioned that [...] "Some have expressed fears that the project could lead to the Earth's demise," [...] but it assured its readers with comments from scientists like John Huth, who said that it was [...] "baloney". MSNBC said that, [...] "there are more serious <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about" [...] and allayed fears that [...] "the atom-smasher might set off earthquakes or other dangerous rumblings". The results of an online survey it conducted [...] "indicate that a lot of [...] know enough not to panic". The BBC stated, [...] "the scientific consensus appears to be on the side of CERN's theorists" [...] who say the LHC poses [...] "no conceivable danger". Brian Greene in the New York Times reassured readers by saying, [...] "If a black hole is produced under Geneva, might it swallow Switzerland and continue on a ravenous rampage until the Earth is devoured? It’s a reasonable question with a definite answer: no." ...|$|E
500|$|Xhinovci {{has come}} to believe that he is Hitler reincarnated since he began {{dressing}} as the Nazi leader. He carries numerous pieces of Nazi paraphernalia around with him, including Nazi-era Reichsmarks, swastika-emblazoned buttons, scarves embroidered with swastikas and other Nazi imagery, as well as a copy of Mein Kampf. He has business cards featuring a swastika and the word [...] "Hitler" [...] printed in bold. Locals and peacekeepers alike do not seem to mind Xhinovci's Hitler impersonations, especially as many Kosovars are too preoccupied with the country's crippling poverty and rampant corruption to give his actions much thought. On the contrary, many passersby—including some NATO peacekeepers—stop and greet him with the Nazi salute. One local told Vice News: [...] "I have a lot of other <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about in my life. I might look at him if he walks by, but that's it." [...] Locals apparently believe that his way of earning a living [...] "shows great enterprise". [...] "People respect me," [...] Xhinovci explains. [...] "The young and old [...] men, women and children. Everyone greets me with [...] "Heil Hitler". Xhinovci's five daughters, referred to locally as [...] "Hitler's children", are not bothered by their father's Hitler impersonations. Xhinovci reportedly attends parent-teacher conferences dressed as Hitler and says that teachers and other parents do not mind his appearance. He says that every time he goes to pick his daughters up from school he is surrounded by children who want to talk with him and take pictures. [...] "Girls like to touch my face. They think it's a mask. They pull my hair and ask if they can kiss me on the face. When I'm out of the house with my family, people stop to talk to me. But my wife is not a jealous person—she doesn't mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kaine, a Roman Catholic, is {{personally}} against abortion, but is [...] "largely {{inclined to}} keep the law out of women's reproductive decisions." [...] Kaine has said: [...] "I'm {{a strong supporter of}} Roe v. Wade and women being able to make these decisions. In government, we have enough <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about. We don't need to make people's reproductive decisions for them." [...] Kaine supports some legal restrictions on abortion, such as requiring parental consent for minors (with a judicial bypass procedure) and banning late-term abortions in cases where the woman's life is not at risk.|$|E
2500|$|A {{year after}} the election, there was still ongoing feuding between the McCain and Palin camps over {{the conduct of the}} campaign, {{culminating}} with the November 2009 publication of Palin's memoir [...] Palin criticized McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt heavily, and contended that the McCain campaign had mismanaged her media appearances. Schmidt replied that Palin's telling was [...] "all fiction", and prior McCain strategist John Weaver denounced Palin for [...] "petty and pathetic" [...] attempts to get even. McCain himself simply said that he had read the book, was still very good friends with Palin, and stated: [...] "Look, I'm just moving on. I'm just moving on, and I've got too many other <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about except to say that I'm proud of my campaign." [...] McCain told his staff repeatedly, [...] "Don't look back in anger." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2008, Clarkson {{attracted}} {{over 500}} complaints to the BBC when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes. The BBC stated the comment was a comic rebuttal {{of a common}} misconception about lorry drivers and was within the viewer's expectation of Clarkson's Top Gear persona. Chris Mole, the Member of Parliament for Ipswich, where five prostitutes were murdered in 2006, wrote a [...] "strongly worded" [...] letter to BBC Director-General Mark Thompson, demanding that Clarkson be sacked. Clarkson dismissed Mole's comments in his Sunday Times column the following weekend, writing, [...] "There are more important <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about than what some balding and irrelevant middle-aged man might have said on a crappy BBC2 motoring show." [...] Andrew Tinkler, {{chief executive of the}} Eddie Stobart Group, a major trucking company, stated that [...] "They were just having a laugh. It's the 21st century, let's get our sense of humour in line." ...|$|E

6000|$|Leland looked up, {{and there}} was a trace of dryness in his smile. [...] "I have had quite a few <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> me lately," [...] he said, handing her the note. [...] "This is merely one of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{paced the}} path {{for a few}} moments in silence and then he continued. [...] "It's odd those little things seem {{specially}} big when there are bigger <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about. We'd better go in and do some work." ...|$|E

But I've seen ten {{thousand}} on their backs in the Soudan, and it gave me no such feelin', for when you are makin' history the life of any man is too small a <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> over.

50|$|According {{to another}} legendary about Perumthachacn, his son Kannan was {{certainly}} a greater perfectionist in all craftsmanship and he outdid and outshined his own father. But, Perunthachan never envied him, he was only proud of his son. Nevertheless, the father had a different <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about {{and that was that}} Kannan was in deep love with a princess who was in fact Perumthachan’s own daughter born to a queen. His fatherhood was known to none other than himself and the queen. Though this {{was the subject of a}} secret gossip among just the close circle of Perumthachan’s assistants and the queen’s maids.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the time}} of the administration, the United States was short of nearly {{everything}} during their time of need. All citizens were asked to donate any weapons, horses, and ammunition they possessed to help supply the army, with a small hope of the items being returned. The rationing was done during this time of National need so that food for soldiers, and citizens, wouldn't be an issue. Concepts such as [...] "meatless Mondays" [...] and [...] "wheatless Wednesdays" [...] were also implemented to help ration food, so that the government had one less <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about, essentially.|$|R

"Well, {{neither would}} anybody if they'd {{had all the}} worries I've had, sitting there {{worrying}} on a slow, hot train that stopped at every pig-pen--yes, and on a day-coach, too, by golly!

You see, there is not one of all the little people in the Green Forest who has so many enemies to watch out for as has Whitefoot. There are ever so many who would like nothing better than to dine on plump little Whitefoot. There are Buster Bear and Billy Mink and Shadow the Weasel and Unc' Billy Possum and Hooty the Owl and all the members of the Hawk family, not to mention Blacky the Crow in times when other food is scarce.

It keeps me busy all the time thinking them over and deciding what is right. It's a serious thing to grow up, isn't it, Marilla? But when I have such good friends as you and Matthew and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy I ought to grow up successfully, and I'm sure it will be my own fault if I don't. I feel it's a great responsibility because I have only the one chance. If I don't grow up right I can't go back and begin over again. I've grown two inches this summer, Marilla. Mr. Gillis measured me at Ruby's party. I'm so glad you made my new dresses longer. That dark-green one is so pretty and it was sweet of you to put on the flounce. Of course I know it wasn't really necessary, but flounces are so stylish this fall and Josie Pye has flounces on all her dresses. I know I'll be able to study better because of mine. I shall have such a comfortable feeling deep down in my mind about that flounce." ...|$|E

50|$|The song {{refers to}} a 95-page {{document}} written by Alexander Hamilton, former Secretary of the Treasury, to defend {{his name in the}} wake of a sex scandal. Hamilton does so to protect himself from a major political threat, as Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and Aaron Burr are made aware by Hamilton of his adulterous actions after they accused him of speculation and misappropriation of Treasury funds. He then publishes the document to the public, proving that he did not abuse his Cabinet position for financial gain, but had been instead victim of blackmail by James Reynolds for his one-year affair with Reynolds's wife Maria Reynolds. The document causes Angelica Schuyler to return from London to support her sister, Hamilton's wife Eliza. She then asks Hamilton angrily if he is satisfied, while Jefferson remarks on how he will never be President as his career has been sullied, which is a boon for the Democratic-Republican Party ("that's one less <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about). The song concludes with all of the characters expressing sympathy for Hamilton's wife.|$|R
60|$|It isn't {{a natural}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> keep on <b>worrying</b> about the {{morality}} of one's material prosperity. These are proclivities superinduced by modern conditions of the conscience. There is a natural resistance in every healthy human being to such distressful heart-searchings. Strong instincts battled in Lady Harman against this intermittent sense of responsibility that was beginning <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> her. An immense lot of her was for simply running away from these troublesome considerations, for covering herself up from them, for distraction.|$|R

All right enough, {{but not in the}} way the poetry puts it. Pity for the mariner's wife! all right again, but not in the way the poetry puts it. Look-a here! whose life's the safest in the whole world The poor mariner's. You look at the statistics, you'll see. So don't you fool away any sympathy on the poor mariner's dangers and privations and sufferings. Leave that to the poetry muffs. Now you look at the other side a minute. Here is Captain Brace, forty years old, been at sea thirty. On his way now to take command of his ship and sail south from Bermuda. Next week he'll be under way; easy times; {{comfortable}} quarters; passengers, sociable company; just enough to do to keep his mind healthy and not tire him; king over his ship, boss of everything and everybody; thirty years' safety to learn him that his profession ain't a dangerous one. Now you look back at his home. His wife's a feeble woman; she's a stranger in New York; shut up in blazing hot or freezing cold lodgings, according to the season; don't know anybody hardly; no company but her lonesomeness and her thoughts; husband gone six months at a time. She has borne eight children; five of them she has buried without her husband ever setting eyes on them. She watches them all the long nights till they died--he comfortable on the sea; she followed them to the grave she heard the clods fall that broke her heart he comfortable on the sea; she mourned at home, weeks and weeks, missing them every day and every hour--he cheerful at sea, knowing nothing about it. Now look at it a minute--turn it over in your mind and size it: five children born, she among strangers, and him not by to hearten her; buried, and him not by to comfort her; think of that! Sympathy for the poor mariner's perils is rot; give it to his wife's hard lines, where it belongs! Poetry makes out that all the wife worries about is the dangers her husband's running. She's got substantialer <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> over, I tell you. Poetry's always pitying the poor mariner on account of his perils at sea; better a blamed sight pity him for the nights he can't sleep for thinking of how he had to leave his wife in her very birth pains, lonesome and friendless, in the thick of disease and trouble and death. If there's one thing that can make me madder than another, it's this sappy, damned maritime poetry!" ...|$|E

She tells Victor that she was already married to a man who put his career first and she swore never to do it again, while he has vowed to never again let a “stupid woman” hold him back. He tries to apologize, saying he has been {{under a lot of pressure}} and she tells him he now has one less <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about since she’s intending to cancel the wedding. He says it’s too late to cancel but she responds that it’s “just in the nick of time”. The next morning Milton shows up early on her doorstep to apologize. She tells him it’s not his fault and he insists it is, since Victor has always been desperate for his father’s approval, especially since he’s never gotten it. She wonders why she should marry a man who values his father’s opinion more than hers. Milton tells her that after she left, Victor called him up and “tore him a new one” and blamed him for driving her away. Just then Victor arrives with roses and Milton sneaks out the back. He looks on approvingly as Victor and Gabrielle embrace.|$|R
