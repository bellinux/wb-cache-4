50|$|During {{the past}} year {{there has been a}} marked {{increase}} in the interest taken in military matters in Edmonton and the next few months should see even greater activity in military circles, not only in this city, but throughout the whole of western Canada. The Dominion government has been hampered by lack of funds in their efforts to raise military units in the west. They have done good work in this respect in the past and are every year making many, much-needed improvements. This is a new country, however, and a pretty extensive one and it takes time to introduce all the modern conveniences and equipment so necessary to the maintenance of an ideal volunteer military system in the west. Officers and men who have been connected with military organizations in eastern Canada and in the old country realize to the fullest extant the difficulties under which they are laboring in the west and it speaks volumes for their patriotism and deep interest in the work of establishing a creditable volunteer system that they almost invariably take hold in a whole-hearted manner and endeavor to surmount the obstacles. There are dozens of examples of <b>this</b> <b>right</b> <b>here</b> in Edmonton, and it is due largely to the efforts of such men that Edmonton is now the centre for two first class military units.|$|E

The scores and play fluctuated and they led us with about four minutes to go by 18 to 17. We got a penalty on the half way line and Ray Stehr captain says [...] "kick for the sideline". Wally O'Connell, who played in the game will verify this of course, he was closest to me. Stehr says [...] "which side you going to kick, so I'll go over?" [...] I said [...] "Don't you want the two points - it'll put us in front!" [...] He said [...] "Its too far for you to kick it." [...] Anyway, I {{had a little bit}} of trouble in getting the ball onto a mound. In those days there was no sand or anything like that to assist and I couldn't make a mound from the hardness of the centre, you know, the cricket pitch. So I said to Georgie Watt I'm going to kick this [...] "Lomas style" [...] - that's an upright position of the ball you know, standing up? He said [...] "Oh you couldn't kick that Lomas style." [...] And ah of course as soon as it left my boot, I thought this a goer for sure. Some say it landed in the crowd. I know it landed well over the bloody post because we did have a bit of excitement by kicking it - we were winning! Ironically, when Balmain kicked off I anticipated Jorgenson's kick - he was a great footballer and a great goal kicker, probably a lot better than me. I said to myself he'll kick <b>this</b> <b>right</b> <b>here,</b> which was the 25 yard line. But of course even with us having possession of the ball there could have been a scrum and something could have happened, maybe they could've kicked 2 points with a field goal and all that. Anyway, sure enough, I've caught the ball fortunately and this is the truth and actual facts - I punted it from our own 25 to find the line 5 yards from the corner post under the SCG scoreboard! Right? We won the scrum against the feed and this is where Lisle and O'Connell put a move on that, I'm not quite sure what the name of the move was, any rate, they went bang, bang, bang and fortunately they just passed me the ball and I scored in the corner and that really won the game. It was 22-18 with about 10 seconds to play. Kicking for the conversion goal and I've always said it, people say [...] "ah your bull!", I'm kicking for the goal and in my opinion no chance of missing. I had a lot of confidence and I went into the ball and just before I got into the ball the bell rang for full time you know. And it just put me off and grazed the outside upright so there was two more I would've scored!” [...]|$|E
