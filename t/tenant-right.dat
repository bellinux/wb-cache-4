60|$|The session went on very quietly. The {{question}} of the Irish Reform Bill was postponed till the next year, which was a great thing gained. He carried his bill about the Canada Railway, with sundry other small bills appertaining to it, through the House in a manner which redounded infinitely to his credit. There was just enough of opposition to give a zest to the work, {{and to make the}} affair conspicuous among the affairs of the year. As his chief was in the other house, the work fell altogether into his hands, so that he came to be conspicuous among Under-Secretaries. It was only when he said a word to any leaders of his party about other matters,--about Irish <b>Tenant-right,</b> for instance, which was beginning to loom very large, that he found himself to be snubbed. But {{there was no room for}} action this year in reference to Irish <b>Tenant-right,</b> and therefore any deep consideration of that discomfort might be legitimately postponed. If he did by chance open his mouth on the subject to Mr. Monk, even Mr. Monk discouraged him.|$|E
6000|$|It was September when Phineas {{found himself}} back at Killaloe, {{and he was}} due to be at his office in London in November. The {{excitement}} of Mr. Monk's company was now over, and {{he had nothing to}} do but to receive pouches full of official papers from the Colonial Office, and study all the statistics which came within his reach in reference to the proposed new law for <b>tenant-right.</b> In the meantime Mary was still living with her mother at Killaloe, and still kept herself somewhat aloof from the man she loved. How could it be possible for him not to give way in such circumstances as those? ...|$|E
60|$|The plan {{ultimately}} adopted, after {{a severe}} struggle and with momentous consequences, did not first spring from Mr. Gladstone’s brain. The idea of adapting {{the law to}} custom in all its depth and breadth, and extending the rooted notion of <b>tenant-right</b> to its furthest bearings, was necessarily a plant of Irish and not of English growth. Mr. Chichester Fortescue, the Irish chief secretary and an Irishman, first opened a bold expansion of the familiar principle of many <b>tenant-right</b> bills. He had introduced such a bill himself in 1866, and the conservative government had brought in another in 1867. It is believed that he was instigated to adopt the new and bolder line by Sir Edward Sullivan, then the Irish attorney-general. Away from Sullivan, it was observed, he had little to say of value about his plan. In the cabinet Fortescue was not found effective, but he was thoroughly {{at home in the}} subject, and his speeches in public on Irish business had all the cogency of a man speaking his native tongue, and even genius in an acquired language is less telling. What is astonishing is the magic of the rapid and sympathetic penetration with which Mr. Gladstone went {{to the heart of the}} problem, as it was presented to him by his Irish advisers. This was his way. When acts of policy were not of great or immediate concern, he took them as they came; but when they pressed for treatment and determination, then he swooped down upon them with the strength and vision of an eagle.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Monk's holiday {{programme}} {{allowed him}} {{a week at}} Killaloe, and from thence he {{was to go to}} Limerick, and from Limerick to Dublin, in order that, at both places, he might be entertained at a public dinner and make a speech about <b>tenant-right.</b> Foreseeing that Phineas might commit himself if he attended these meetings, Mr. Monk had counselled him to remain at Killaloe. But Phineas had refused to subject himself to such cautious abstinence. Mr. Monk had come to Ireland as his friend, and he would see him through his travels. [...] "I shall not, probably, be asked to speak," [...] said Phineas, [...] "and if I am asked, I need not say more than a few words. And what if I did speak out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Phineas did not stir {{out of the}} House {{till the}} {{division}} was over, having agreed with Mr. Monk that they two would remain through it all and hear everything {{that was to be}} said. Mr. Gresham had already spoken, and to Mr. Palliser was confided the task of winding up the argument for the Government. Mr. Robson spoke also, greatly enlivening the tedium of the evening, and to Mr. Monk was permitted the privilege of a final reply. At two o'clock the division came, and the Ministry were beaten by a majority of twenty-three. [...] "And now," [...] said Mr. Monk, as he again walked home with Phineas, [...] "the pity is that we are not a bit nearer <b>tenant-right</b> than we were before." ...|$|E
60|$|If {{the crown}} has any {{favorite}} name or title, {{if the subject}} has any matter of local accommodation within any of these jurisdictions, {{it is meant to}} preserve them,--and to improve them, if any improvement can be suggested. As to the crown reversions or titles upon the property of the people there, it is proposed to convert them from a snare to their independence into a relief from their burdens. I propose, therefore, to unite all the five principalities to the crown, and to its ordinary jurisdiction,--to abolish all those offices that produce an useless and chargeable separation from the body of the people,--to compensate those who do not hold their offices (if any such there are) at the pleasure of the crown,--to extinguish vexatious titles by an act of short limitation,--to sell those unprofitable estates which support useless jurisdictions,--and to turn the <b>tenant-right</b> into a fee, on such moderate terms as will be better for the state than its present right, and which it is impossible for any rational tenant to refuse.|$|E
6000|$|When Parliament met {{the first}} great subject of {{interest}} was the desertion of Mr. Monk from the Ministry. He at once took his place below the gangway, sitting as it happened exactly in front of Mr. Turnbull, and there he made his explanation. Some one opposite asked a question whether a certain right honourable gentleman had not left the Cabinet. Then Mr. Gresham replied that to his infinite regret his right honourable friend, who lately presided at the Board of Trade, had resigned; {{and he went on}} to explain that this resignation had, according to his ideas, been quite unnecessary. His right honourable friend entertained certain ideas about Irish <b>tenant-right,</b> as to which he himself and his right honourable friend the Secretary for Ireland could not exactly pledge themselves to be in unison with him; but he had thought that the motion might have rested at any rate over this session. Then Mr. Monk explained, making his first great speech on Irish <b>tenant-right.</b> He found himself obliged to advocate some immediate measure for giving security to the Irish farmer; and as he could not do so {{as a member of the}} Cabinet, he was forced to resign the honour of that position. He said something also as to the great doubt which had ever weighed on his own mind as to the inexpediency of a man at his time of life submitting himself for the first time to the trammels of office. This called up Mr. Turnbull, who took the opportunity of saying that he now agreed cordially with his old friend for the first time since that old friend had listened to the blandishments of the ministerial seducer, and that he welcomed his old friend back to those independent benches with great satisfaction. In this way the debate was very exciting. Nothing was said which made it then necessary for Phineas to get upon his legs or to declare himself; but he perceived that the time would rapidly come in which he must do so. Mr. Gresham, though he strove to speak with gentle words, was evidently very angry with the late President of the Board of Trade; and, moreover, it was quite clear that a bill would be introduced by Mr. Monk himself, which Mr. Gresham was determined to oppose. If all this came to pass and there should be a close division, Phineas felt that his fate would be sealed. When he again spoke to Lord Cantrip on the subject, the Secretary of State shrugged his shoulders and shook his head. [...] "I can only advise you," [...] said Lord Cantrip, [...] "to forget all that took place in Ireland. If you will do so, nobody else will remember it." [...] "As if it were possible to forget such things," [...] he said in the letter which he wrote to Mary that night. [...] "Of course I shall go now. If it were not for your sake, I should not in the least regret it." ...|$|E
6000|$|This trip to Ireland {{had been}} {{proposed}} in consequence of certain ideas respecting <b>tenant-right</b> which Mr. Monk {{was beginning to}} adopt, and as to which the minds of politicians were becoming moved. It had been all very well to put down Fenianism, and Ribandmen, and Repeal,--and everything that had been put down in Ireland {{in the way of}} rebellion for the last seventy-five years. England and Ireland had been apparently joined together by laws of nature so fixed, that even politicians liberal as was Mr. Monk,--liberal as was Mr. Turnbull,--could not trust themselves to think that disunion could be {{for the good of the}} Irish. They had taught themselves that it certainly could not be good for the English. But if it was incumbent on England to force upon Ireland the maintenance of the Union for her own sake, and for England's sake, because England could not afford independence established so close against her own ribs,--it was at any rate necessary to England's character that the bride thus bound in a compulsory wedlock should be endowed with all the best privileges that a wife can enjoy. Let her at least not be a kept mistress. Let it be bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh, if we are to live together in the married state. Between husband and wife a warm word now and then matters but little, if there be a thoroughly good understanding at bottom. But let there be that good understanding at bottom. What about this Protestant Church; and what about this <b>tenant-right?</b> Mr. Monk had been asking himself these questions for some time past. In regard to the Church, he had long made up his mind that the Establishment in Ireland was a crying sin. A man had married a woman whom he knew to be of a religion different from his own, and then insisted that his wife should say that she believed those things which he knew very well that she did not believe. But, as Mr. Monk well knew, the subject of the Protestant Endowments in Ireland was so difficult that it would require almost more than human wisdom to adjust it. It was one of those matters which almost seemed to require the interposition of some higher power,--the coming of some apparently chance event,--to clear away the evil; as a fire comes, and pestilential alleys are removed; as a famine comes, and men are driven from want and ignorance and dirt to seek new homes and new thoughts across the broad waters; as a war comes, and slavery is banished from the face of the earth. But in regard to <b>tenant-right,</b> to some arrangement by which a tenant in Ireland might be at least encouraged to lay out what little capital he might have in labour or money without being at once called upon to pay rent for that outlay which was his own, as well as for the land which was not his own,--Mr. Monk thought that it was possible that if a man would look hard enough he might perhaps be able to see his way as to that. He had spoken to two of his colleagues on the subject, the two men in the Cabinet whom he believed to be the most thoroughly honest in their ideas as public servants, the Duke and Mr. Gresham. There was so much to be done;--and then so little was known upon the subject! [...] "I will endeavour to study it," [...] said Mr. Monk. [...] "If you can see your way, do;" [...] said Mr. Gresham,--"but of course we cannot bind ourselves." [...] "I should be glad to see it named in the Queen's speech at the beginning of the next session," [...] said Mr. Monk. [...] "That is a long way off as yet," [...] said Mr. Gresham, laughing. [...] "Who will be in then, and who will be out?" [...] So the matter was disposed of at the time, but Mr. Monk did not abandon his idea. He rather felt himself the more bound to cling to it because he received so little encouragement. What was a seat in the Cabinet to him that he should on that account omit a duty? He had not taken up politics as a trade. He had sat far behind the Treasury bench or below the gangway for many a year, without owing any man a shilling,--and could afford to do so again.|$|E
60|$|But she did see {{him again}} before the summer was over, and the manner of their meeting was in this wise. Immediately after the passing of that {{scrambled}} Irish Reform Bill, Parliament, as the reader knows, was dissolved. This {{was in the early}} days of June, and before the end of July the new members were again assembled at Westminster. This session, late in summer, was very terrible; but it was not very long, and then it was essentially necessary. There was something of the year's business which must yet be done, and the country would require to know who were to be the Ministers of the Government. It is not needed that the reader should be troubled any further with the strategy of one political leader or of another, or that more should be said of Mr. Monk and his <b>tenant-right.</b> The House of Commons had offended Mr. Gresham by voting in a majority against him, and Mr. Gresham had punished the House of Commons by subjecting it to the expense and nuisance of a new election. All this is constitutional, and rational enough to Englishmen, though it may be unintelligible to strangers. The upshot on the present occasion was that the Ministers remained in their places and that Mr. Monk's bill, though it had received the substantial honour of a second reading, passed away for the present into the limbo of abortive legislation.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the first}} night of his arrival he sat for an hour downstairs with his father talking over his plans. He felt,--he could not but feel,--that he was not the hero now that he had been when he was last at Killaloe,--when he had come thither with a Cabinet Minister under his wing. And yet his father did his best to prevent the growth of any such feeling. The old doctor was not quite as well off as he had been when Phineas first started with his high hopes for London. Since that day he had {{abandoned}} his profession and was now living on the fruits of his life's labour. For the last two years he had been absolved from the necessity of providing an income for his son, and had probably allowed himself to feel that no such demand upon him would again be made. Now, however, it was necessary that he should do so. Could his son manage to live on two hundred a-year? There would then be four hundred a-year left for the wants of the family at home. Phineas swore that he could fight his battle on a hundred and fifty, and they ended the argument by splitting the difference. He had been paying exactly the same sum of money for the rooms he had just left in London; but then, while he held those rooms, his income had been two thousand a-year. <b>Tenant-right</b> was a very fine thing, but could it be worth such a fall as this? ...|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke for}} about an hour, {{and while he was}} {{speaking}} he knew nothing about himself, whether he was doing it well or ill. Something of himself he did say soon after he had commenced,--not quite beginning with it, as though his mind had been laden with the matter. He had, he said, found himself compelled to renounce his happy allegiance to the First Lord of the Treasury, and to quit the pleasant company in which, humble as had been his place, he had been allowed to sit and act, by his unfortunate conviction in this great subject. He had been told, he said, that it was a misfortune in itself for one so young as he to have convictions. But his Irish birth and Irish connection had brought this misfortune of his country so closely home to him that he had found the task of extricating himself from it to be impossible. Of what further he said, speaking on that terribly unintelligible subject, a <b>tenant-right</b> proposed for Irish farmers, no English reader will desire to know much. Irish subjects in the House of Commons are interesting or are dull, are debated before a crowded audience composed of all who are leaders in the great world of London, or before empty benches, in accordance with the importance of the moment and the character of the debate. For us now it is enough to know that to our hero was accorded that attention which orators love,--which will almost make an orator if it can be assured. A full House with a promise of big type on the next morning would wake to eloquence the propounder of a Canadian grievance, or the mover of an Indian budget.|$|E
60|$|In 1843 the Devon Commission had {{reported}} {{that it is the}} tenant who has made the improvements; that large confiscations of these improvements had been systematically practised in the shape of progressive enhancements of rent; that crime and disorder sprang from the system; and that parliament ought to interfere. A bill was proposed by the Peel government in 1845 for protecting the rightful interests of the tenant against the landlord. It was introduced in the House mainly composed of landlords. There it had such contumelious greeting, that it was speedily dropped. This was a crowning illustration of the levity of the imperial parliament dealing with Irish problems. The vital necessity for readjusting the foundations of social life demonstrated; a half measure languidly attempted; attempt dropped; bills sent to slumber in limbo; dry rot left quietly alone for a whole generation, until bloody outrage and murder awoke legislative conscience or roused executive fear. The union was seventy years old before the elementary feature in the agrarian condition of Ireland was recognised by the parliament which had undertaken to govern Ireland. Before the union Ireland was governed by the British cabinet, through the Irish landed gentry, according to their views, and in their interests. After the union it was just the same. She was treated as a turbulent and infected province within the larger island; never as a community with an internal economy peculiarly her own, with special sentiments, history, recollections, points of view, and necessities all her own. Between the union and the year 1870, Acts dealing with Irish land had been passed at Westminster. Every one of these Acts was {{in the interest of the}} landlord and against the tenant. A score of Insurrection Acts, no <b>Tenant-right</b> Act. Meanwhile Ireland had gone down into the dark gulfs of the Famine (1846-7).|$|E
6000|$|Our hero {{had a bad}} {{half hour}} of it, though many words were said which must have gratified him much. They all wanted to keep him,--so Lord Cantrip declared, [...] "except one or two whom I could name, and who are {{particularly}} anxious to wear his shoes," [...] said Barrington, thinking that certain reminiscences of Phineas with regard to Mr. Bonteen and others might operate as strongly as any other consideration to make him love his place. Lord Brentford declared {{that he could not}} understand it,--that he should find himself lost in amazement if such a man as his young friend allowed himself to be led into the outer wilderness by such an ignis-fatuus of light as this. Lord Cantrip laid down the unwritten traditional law of Government officials very plainly. A man in office,--in an office which really imposed upon him as much work as he could possibly do with credit to himself or his cause,--was dispensed from the necessity of a conscience with reference to other matters. It was for Sir Walter Morrison to have a conscience about Irish <b>tenant-right,</b> as no doubt he had,--just as Phineas Finn had a conscience about Canada, and Jamaica, and the Cape. Barrington Erle was very strong about parties in general, and painted the comforts of official position in glowing colours. But I think that the two ladies were more efficacious than even their male relatives in the arguments which they used. [...] "We have been so happy to have you among us," [...] said Lady Cantrip, looking at him with beseeching, almost loving eyes. [...] "Mr. Finn knows," [...] said Lady Laura, [...] "that since he first came into Parliament I have always believed in his success, and I have been very proud to see it." [...] "We shall weep over him, as over a fallen angel, if he leaves us," [...] said Lady Cantrip. [...] "I won't say that I will weep," [...] said Lady Laura, [...] "but I do not know anything of the kind that would so truly make me unhappy." ...|$|E
60|$|You may {{suppose that}} we do not approve your {{confiscation}} of the revenues of bishops, and deans, and chapters, and parochial clergy possessing independent estates arising from land, because we have the same sort of establishment in England. That objection, you will say, cannot hold as to the confiscation of the goods of monks and nuns, and the abolition of their order. It is true that this particular part of your general confiscation does not affect England, as a precedent in point; but the reason applies, and it goes a great way. The Long Parliament confiscated the lands of deans and chapters in England on the same ideas upon which your Assembly set to sale the lands of the monastic orders. But it is in the principle of injustice that the danger lies, and not in the description of persons on whom it is first exercised. I see, in a country very near us, a course of policy pursued, which sets justice, the common concern of mankind, at defiance. With the National Assembly of France possession is nothing, law and usage are nothing. I see the National Assembly openly reprobate the doctrine of prescription, which one of the greatest of their own lawyers[114] tells us, with great truth, {{is a part of the}} law of Nature. He tells us that the positive ascertainment of its limits, and its security from invasion, were among the causes for which civil society itself has been instituted. If prescription be once shaken, no species of property is secure, when it once becomes an object large enough to tempt the cupidity of indigent power. I see a practice perfectly correspondent to their contempt of this great fundamental part of natural law. I see the confiscators begin with bishops, and chapters, and monasteries; but I do not see them end there. I see the princes of the blood, who, by the oldest usages of that kingdom, held large landed estates, (hardly with the compliment of a debate,) deprived of their possessions, and, in lieu of their stable, independent property, reduced to the hope of some precarious charitable pension at the pleasure of an Assembly, which of course will pay little regard to the rights of pensioners at pleasure, when it despises those of legal proprietors. Flushed with the insolence of their first inglorious victories, and pressed by the distresses caused by their lust of unhallowed lucre, disappointed, but not discouraged, they have at length ventured completely to subvert all property of all descriptions throughout the extent of a great kingdom. They have compelled all men, in all transactions of commerce, in the disposal of lands, in civil dealing, and through the whole communion of life, to accept, as perfect payment and good and lawful tender, the symbols of their speculations on a projected sale of their plunder. What vestiges of liberty or property have they left? The <b>tenant-right</b> of a cabbage-garden, a year's interest in a hovel, the good-will of an ale-house or a baker's shop, the very shadow of a constructive property, are more ceremoniously treated in our Parliament than with you the oldest and most valuable landed possessions, in the hands of the most respectable personages, or than the whole body of the moneyed and commercial interest of your country. We entertain a high opinion of the legislative authority; but we have never dreamt that Parliaments had any right whatever to violate property, to overrule prescription, or to force a currency of their own fiction in the place of that which is real, and recognized by the law of nations. But you, who began with refusing to submit to the most moderate restraints, have ended by establishing an unheard-of despotism. I find the ground upon which your confiscators go is this: that, indeed, their proceedings could not be supported in a court of justice, but that the rules of prescription cannot bind a legislative assembly.[115] So that this legislative assembly of a free nation sits, not for the security, but for the destruction of property,--and not of property only, but of every rule and maxim which can give it stability, and of those instruments which can alone give it circulation.|$|E
6000|$|This {{proposition}} {{had taken}} Phineas Finn {{so much by}} surprise that when first made to him by Barrington Erle it took his breath away. What! he stand for Parliament, twenty-four years old, with no vestige of property belonging to him, without a penny in his purse, as completely dependent on his father as {{he was when he}} first went to school at eleven years of age! And for Loughshane, a little borough in the county Galway, for which a brother of that fine old Irish peer, the Earl of Tulla, had been sitting for the last twenty years,--a fine, high-minded representative of the thorough-going Orange Protestant feeling of Ireland! And the Earl of Tulla, to whom almost all Loughshane belonged,--or at any rate the land about Loughshane,--was one of his father's staunchest friends! Loughshane is in county Galway, but the Earl of Tulla usually lived at his seat in county Clare, not more than ten miles from Killaloe, and always confided his gouty feet, and the weak nerves of the old countess, and the stomachs of all his domestics, to the care of Dr. Finn. How was it possible that Phineas should stand for Loughshane? From whence was the money to come for such a contest? It was a beautiful dream, a grand idea, lifting Phineas almost off the earth by its glory. When the proposition was first made to him in the smoking-room at the Reform Club by his friend Erle, he was aware that he blushed like a girl, and that he was unable at the moment to express himself plainly,--so great was his astonishment and so great his gratification. But before ten minutes had passed by, while Barrington Erle was still sitting over his shoulder on the club sofa, and before the blushes had altogether vanished, he had seen the improbability of the scheme, and had explained to his friend that the thing could not be done. But to his increased astonishment, his friend made nothing of the difficulties. Loughshane, according to Barrington Erle, was so small a place, that the expense would be very little. There were altogether no more than 307 registered electors. The inhabitants were so far removed from the world, and were so ignorant of the world's good things, that they knew nothing about bribery. The Hon. George Morris, who had sat for the last twenty years, was very unpopular. He had not been near the borough since the last election, he had hardly done more than show himself in Parliament, and had neither given a shilling in the town nor got a place under Government for a single son of Loughshane. [...] "And he has quarrelled with his brother," [...] said Barrington Erle. [...] "The devil he has!" [...] said Phineas. [...] "I thought they always swore by each other." [...] "It's at each other they swear now," [...] said Barrington; [...] "George has asked the Earl for more money, and the Earl has cut up rusty." [...] Then the negotiator went on to explain that the expenses of the election would be defrayed out of a certain fund collected for such purposes, that Loughshane had been chosen as a cheap place, and that Phineas Finn had been chosen as a safe and promising young man. As for qualification, if any question were raised, that should be made all right. An Irish candidate was wanted, and a Roman Catholic. So much the Loughshaners would require on their own account when instigated to dismiss from their service that thorough-going Protestant, the Hon. George Morris. Then [...] "the party,"--by which Barrington Erle probably meant the great man in whose service he himself had become a politician,--required that the candidate should be a safe man, one who would support [...] "the party,"--not a cantankerous, red-hot semi-Fenian, running about to meetings at the Rotunda, and such-like, with views of his own about <b>tenant-right</b> and the Irish Church. [...] "But I have views of my own," [...] said Phineas, blushing again. [...] "Of course you have, my dear boy," [...] said Barrington, clapping him on the back. [...] "I shouldn't come to you unless you had views. But your views and ours are the same, and you're just the lad for Galway. You mightn't have such an opening again in your life, and of course you'll stand for Loughshane." [...] Then the conversation was over, the private secretary went away to arrange some other little matter of the kind, and Phineas Finn was left alone to consider the proposition that had been made to him.|$|E

There will be several leading gentlemen present who will speak on the occasion, amongst whom will be John O'C. Power, Esq., M.P., John Ferguson, Esq. Glasgow, and J.J.Louden, Esq. Westport. The meeting, it is considered, {{will be one of the}} largest ever held in Connaught.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the first}} Finlay {{advocated}} the emancipation of the Roman Catholics, {{and it was}} in the columns of the 'Northern Whig' that William Sharman Crawford propounded his celebrated views on <b>tenant-right.</b> Some comments in the 'Northern Whig' on the conduct of Lord Hertford's agent led to another prosecution for libel in 1830, which, however, was abandoned when it transpired that Daniel O'Connell had volunteered for the defence. On a similar charge he was found guilty on 23 July 1832 and sentenced to three months' imprisonment and fined 50l. In spite, however, of these proceedings, the 'Northern Whig' continued {{from time to time to}} give expression to similar views which were adjudged libellous and occasioned its proprietor very heavy legal expenditure. To the extension of the suffrage, the disestablishment of the Irish church, and the reform of the land laws Finlay through his paper gave a steady and zealous support but, though a personal friend of O'Connell, he opposed the movement for the repeal of the union and the later developments of Irish disaffection, such as the Young Irelandism of Mitchell and the agitation which resulted in the abortive insurrection of Smith O'Brien.|$|E
5000|$|In mid-1863, Stephens {{informed}} {{his colleagues}} {{he wished to}} start a newspaper, with financial aid from O’Mahony and the Fenian Brotherhood in America. The offices were established at 12 Parliament Street, almost {{at the gates of}} Dublin Castle. The first number of the Irish People appeared on 28 November 1863. The staff of the paper along with Kickham were Luby and Denis Dowling Mulcahy as the editorial staff. O’Donovan Rossa and James O’Connor had charge of the business office, with John Haltigan being the printer. John O'Leary was brought from London to take charge in the role of Editor. Shortly after the establishment of the paper, Stephens departed on an America tour, and to attend to organizational matters. Before leaving, he entrusted to Luby a document containing secret resolutions on the Committee of Organization or Executive of the IRB. Though Luby intimated its existence to O’Leary, he did not inform Kickham as there seemed no necessity. This document would later form the basis of the prosecution against the staff of the Irish People. The document read:Kickham’s first contribution to the Irish People appeared in the third number titled, “Leaves from a Journal,” based on a journal kept by Kickham on his way to America in 1863. This article left no doubt as to his literary capacity according to O’Leary. The third edition also saw the last article by Stephens titled “Felon-setting” a much used phrase now to the Irish political vocabulary.It would fall to Kickham, as a good Catholic to tackle the priests, though not exclusively with articles such as “Two Sets of Principles,” a rebuff to the doctrines laid down by Lord Carlisle, and “A Retrospect” dealing with the <b>tenant-right</b> movement chiefly but also the events of the recent past and their bearing on the present. Kickham would articulate the attitude held by the IRB in relation to priests, or more particularly in politics: ...|$|E

In this paper I propose to notice the other three impediments, namely, the restraints {{on the power of}} making <b>tenant-right</b> agreements, the stamps on leases and other contracts with tenants, and the remnant of the usury laws. I shall also consider the legal impediments to the application of capital, by proprietors, to agricultural improvements...|$|E
40|$|Sir George Campbell, in {{an admirable}} {{pamphlet}} published in June, 1869, points out with great clearness {{the de facto}} state of land tenure in Ireland. He shows that although the legal conditions were at that time substantially the same in both England and Ireland they had seldom in practice been fully acted on or recognised by either landlord or tenant in Ireland. He shows how under this strange condition of things [laws made {{on the principle of}} contract only and customs prevailing on the principle of status or tenure] there had sprung up <b>tenant-right</b> in the north, and elsewhere somewhat analogous usages, or at least expectations, any interference with which {{on the part of the}} landlord was resented by the tenant, and often led to violence. He thus describes the Ulster custom...|$|E
40|$|Already in {{the twelfth}} century, men canvassed {{different}} {{views on the}} ways in which they thought lordship ought to be exercised. They used their picture of how an idealised "Good Lord" [...] a familiar label in later times [...] comported himself to assess the treatment they actually received from their lords. This Good Lordship had both Positive and Negative aspects: the "good lord" maintained his vassals in their honours and renounced his right to revoke grants afterwards. One excellent way to study the pursuit of this double ideal is through the language of charters, more particularly through the warranty clauses by which Good Lordship was often implemented. The transformation of warranty into its familiar Common-Law shape reflects corresponding and complex changes in both lord-vassal relations and the role of the King and his justice. 	Warranty actually began as a security device, designed to keep men to their word, and is found used in this sense over wide areas of sub- Carolingian Europe. It was probably imported to England by the French, and can be seen in twelfth-century charters progressively superseding other forms of words to become the classic "guarantee" of Good Lordship. In this manner it came by 1200 to be virtually equated with the lordship it had originally been used to enforce. Warranty was lordship seen from the vassal's point of view, that is, <b>tenant-right.</b> 	Despite this origin in very personal relations, warranty probably always created between the parties' heirs some kind of obligation, which sharpened and was made infinitely more clear-cut with the emergence of full legal inheritance rights. Warranty swelled to full <b>tenant-right,</b> a full guarantee of the Right to Good Lordship. 	As the heir's claim grew into an enforceable right of inheritance through increasing access to remedies by royal justice, and because such justice tended to strict construction, warranty became a contractual addition to which claimants had to prove their entitlement. The narrative of legal change from 1150 argues for gradual evolution but also suggests 1153 - 4 as the decisive turning-point in this development. 	Detailed (sometimes technical) examination of evidence for some relevant cases, royal writs concerning warranty and the turning-point of 1153 - 4 is reserved for three appendixes...|$|E
40|$|Few {{subjects}} {{have engaged}} {{so much of}} the public attention in Ireland as the condition of the tenant farmers, and it is generally admitted that the present laws, and the practice generally prevailing with respect to the letting of land, have had very injurious effects in impeding the improvement of the country. Various remedies have been proposed as panaceas for these evils. <b>Tenant-right,</b> fixity of tenure, valuation of rent, compensation for improvements, have each had its respective advocates. Whenever the attempt has been made to reduce these proposed plans to practice as the basis of legislation, difficulties have arisen which appear not to have been previously anticipated; so that no one of these schemes, when carried out into detail, has given satisfaction to the several parties interested. The difficulties which have thus arisen, and the complicated nature of the various legislative measures proposed, naturally lead us to consider whether any of these plans are calculated to effect a cure; whether the causes of the evil do not lie deeper, and require remedies of a different characte...|$|E
