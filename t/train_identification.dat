The wheels of the first two cars in the six-car, White-Flint-bound train were forced off the tracks, stopping the train. Almost all of the estimated 345 passengers were evacuated from the damaged train by 11:50am and the NTSB arrived on the scene by noon. Two minor injuries were reported, and a third passenger was taken to George Washington University Hospital. The NTSB ruled the crash was due to the train operator's failure to follow standard procedures and WMATA management for failure to provide proper supervision of the train operator which resulted in the incomplete configuration of the <b>train</b> <b>identification</b> and destination codes leading to the routing of the train into the pocket track.|$|E

The data come from a longitudinal study of homeless individuals in Minneapolis. Various individual attributes are linked with leaving homelessness, including recent employment, welfare receipt, job <b>training,</b> <b>identification</b> with other homeless people, and homeless history. Fewer attributes are linked with returns to homelessness: work history and gender.

50|$|New Deal was {{originally}} known as Monroe, named for Monroe G. Abernathy, a local landowner. The town {{was originally}} {{developed as a}} train station loading site. People began to settle there {{and that is why}} the town was built alongside the railroad tracks and highway. The <b>train</b> <b>identification</b> name for the township still reads Monroe alongside the railroad tracks. Some time afterward the town wanted a post office and requested the permit for the Monroe Postal Station. Because there was already a town in Texas with the name Monroe City, the U.S. postal department changed the name of the town to New Deal after Franklin D. Roosevelt's programs and {{to go along with the}} consolidated school system's name. This information was all developed when the school system had to write a history when applying for a federal grant. In 1970, the township was incorporated by the vote of its citizens. The city of Lubbock, Texas, was planning some annexation of surrounding lands and the people of the New Deal area decided to incorporate rather than be annexed to the city of Lubbock. A local farmer, Billy Fortenberry, was the first mayor. In 1970, Ray Edell West, a city councilman for three years, became the mayor. Under his mayoral direction in the next 7 years, the town built a City Hall and a Volunteer Fire Department building.|$|E

40|$|One {{recovery}} {{strategy in}} case of a major disruption in a rail network is to cancel all trains on a specific line of the network. When the disturbance has ended, the cancelled line must be reinserted as soon as possible.

40|$|Learning to {{identify}} organisms is extraordinarily difficult, yet trained field biologists can {{quickly and easily}} identify organisms at a glance. They do this without recourse {{to the use of}} traditional characters or identification devices. Achieving this type of recognition accuracy is a goal of many courses in plant systematics. Teaching plant identification is difficult because of variability in the plants ’ appearance, the difficulty of bringing them into the classroom, and the difficulty of taking students into the field. To solve these problems, we developed and tested a cognitive psychology– based computer program to teach plant identification. The program incorporates presentation of plant images in a homework-based, active-learning format that was developed to stimulate expert-level visual recognition. A controlled experimental test using a within-subject design was performed against traditional study methods {{in the context of a}} college course in plant systematics. Use of the program resulted in an 8 – 25 % statistically significant improvement in final exam scores, depending on the type of identification question used (living plants, photographs, written descriptions). The software demonstrates how the use of routines to train perceptual expertise, interleaved examples, spaced repetition, and retrieval practice can be used to <b>train</b> <b>identification</b> of complex and highly variable objects...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} carried out to investigate the effect of sanding on the electrical isolation of a wheel/rail contact. Sand is applied to the wheel/rail interface to increase adhesion in both braking and traction. Train detection, for signalling purposes, can be by means of track circuits. Signalling block occupancy is triggered by the wheelset of the train ‘shorting out’ the track circuit. Sand in the wheel/rail interface means that contact between the wheelsets and the track may be compromised, inhibiting <b>train</b> <b>identification.</b> Static tests were performed using sections cut from wheels and rail and dynamic tests on a twin disc machine where rail and wheel steel discs are loaded together and driven under controlled conditions of rolling and slip. The electrical circuit used was a simplified simulation of the TI 21 track circuit. The application of sand was carried out under a range of mild and severe test conditions. The results indicated that a transition exists in the amount of sand applied, below which there is a measurable, but not severe, change in voltage, but above which the contact conductance decreases by an order of magnitude. A model of electrical isolation has been developed assuming either full disc separation by a sand layer or partial disc contact with some sand present. Idealisations inherent in both test methods mean that they represent a severe case. Given these limitations, {{it is likely that the}} test methods, at their present stage of development, should be used as a means to qualitatively assess the relative effects on electrical isolation of different contaminants...|$|E
40|$|Historically, due to {{the high}} cost of optical devices, fiber-optics sensor systems were only {{employed}} in niche areas where conventional electrical sensors are not suitable. This scenario changed dramatically {{in the last few years}} following the explosion of the Internet which caused the rapid expansion of the optical fiber telecommunication industry and substantially driven down the cost of optical components. In recent years, fiber-optic sensors and particularly fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors have attracted a lot of interests and are being used in numerous applications. We have conducted several field trials of FBG sensors for railway applications and structural monitoring. About 30 FBG sensors were installed on the rail tracks of Kowloon¬Canton Railway Corp. for <b>train</b> <b>identification</b> and speed measurements and the results obtained show that FBG sensors exhibit very good performance and could play a major role in the realization of "Smart Railway". FBG sensors were also installed on Hong Kong's landmark TsingMa Bridge, which is the world longest suspension bridge (2. 2 km) that carries both trains and regular road traffic. The trials were carried out with a high-speed (up to 20 kHz) interrogation system based on CCD and also with a interrogation unit that based on scanning optical filter (up to 70 Hz). Forty FBGs sensors were divided into 3 arrays and installed on different parts of the bridge (suspension cable, rocker bearing and truss girders). The objectives of the field trial on the TsingMa Bridge are to monitor the strain of different parts of the bridge under railway load and highway load, and to compare the FBG sensors' performance with conventional resistive strain gauges already installed on the bridge. The measured results show that excellent agreement was obtained between the 2 types of sensors...|$|E
