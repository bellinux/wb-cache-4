5|$|The {{tradition}} of singing carols in pubs around Christmas is still kept {{alive in the}} city. The Sheffield Carols, as they are known locally, predate modern carols by over a century and are sung with alternative words and verses. Although there is a core of carols that are sung at most venues, each particular place has its own mini-tradition. The repertoire at two nearby places can vary widely, and woe betide those who try to strike up a ‘foreign’ carol. Some are unaccompanied, some have a piano or organ, there is a flip chart with <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>on</b> in one place, a string quartet (quintet, sextet, septet) accompanies the singing at another, some encourage soloists, others stick to audience participation, a brass band plays at certain events, the choir takes the lead at another. It is thought this tradition is now unique in Britain.|$|E

Major biblical stories are recast as mini-blockbusters; individual psalms are rewritten as song lyrics; the Pauline epistles become emails to the fledgling [...] "Jesus Liberation Movement" [...] (aka <b>the</b> church). <b>The</b> <b>Word</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Street is published by Zondervan.|$|R

The words were often written in late-night eight- to ten-hour-long sessions before the pair were due to record the vocals. The pair worked diligently to ensure the lyrics were not lackluster, even though few changes actually resulted; Shields said, [...] "There's nothing worse than bad lyrics."

500|$|Based on {{observations}} of modern Maya rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod {{claim that the}} stela refers to a celebration {{in which a person}} portraying Bolon Yokte' K'uh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site. They note that the association of Bolon Yokte' K'uh with b'ak'tun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations such as [...] "erection of stelae, scattering of incense" [...] and so forth. Furthermore, they assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012 and not the 7th century. Mayanist scholar Stephen Houston contests this view by arguing that future dates on Maya inscriptions were simply meant to draw parallels with contemporary events, and that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>on</b> the stela describe a contemporary rather than a future scene.|$|E

500|$|In 1993, Cobain told Spin that on Bleach he [...] "didn't give {{a flying}} fuck what the lyrics were about" [...] {{and claimed that}} 80 percent of the lyrics were written the night before {{recording}}. He was often still working on <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>on</b> the drive to the recording studio. He explained: [...] "It was like I'm pissed off. Don't know what about. Let's just scream negative lyrics, {{and as long as}} they're not sexist and don't get too embarrassing it'll be okay. I don't hold any of those lyrics dear to me." [...] Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad noted that, nevertheless, many of the songs on the album reflected Cobain and various incidents in his life.

500|$|Madonna's vocal range spans {{almost one}} octave from F3 to D4. As {{she begins to}} sing the first verse, the bass pedal changes to C major, changes back to F during the chorus, and back to D minor during the chorus closure. This process is {{repeated}} during the second verse and chorus, which abruptly ends in a silence, with only the low and lifeless sound of the synthesizer, set in D minor. Madonna then starts to sing the bridge (or middle part)— [...] "If I ran away, I'd never have the strength"— between the tonal keys of D and F, closing with the repetition of the chorus until the song gradually fades out. The original composition of the song {{did not have the}} background synths, instead Leonard created a basic structure on piano, and Madonna added <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>on</b> top of it. According to Leonard, Madonna came up with the bridge by herself, extending it from the music that he was playing.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} {{music of the}} song {{published}} online by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] {{is set in the}} time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 127 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of A minor with Madonna's vocals ranging from Gm to Dm. The song follows a sequence of Gm–Cm–E during the opening prayer verse and Am–Em–G–F for the rest as its chord progression. Mike Senior from Sound on Sound magazine found that along with the predominant synth sounds, there was [...] "a lot" [...] of double tracking present in the song which made the vocals unclear. He felt that this was not pose a problem in stereo sound, but with mono sounds the combined vocals appeared double tracked while the vocal level decreased. The mixing for [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] was done mainly for stereo speakers and around the 1:45–2:00 mark, the vocal levels fluctuate with the backing music being dwarfed. Senior also observed that Madonna put the stresses of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>on</b> the beats of the song, hence some of the enunciation are lost with the drum sounds, especially on the title hook.|$|E

500|$|In Ved Vejen, Bang has masterfully {{developed}} his impressionistic style. While recognizing that impressionism was {{first and foremost}} a trend in painting, he explained in a letter sent to Peter Nansen from Prague {{that he was trying to}} achieve the same style in literature: [...] "Impressionistic is indeed the word. I am frantically striving to make every single impression clear and precise and distinctive, and so I never think about the whole" [...] Jean-Claude Polet adds that while he owes much to Zola, Daudet and Maupassant, he channels naturalism into a quite unexpected direction, that of impressionism. His characters are revealed through their responses or a slight turn of phrase along the lines of the Norwegian Jonas Lie or the Russian Turgenev. He does not explain, he merely presents a picture, providing the reader with impressions, allowing him to read between the lines, interpreting what lies behind <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> <b>On</b> meeting Claude Monet, he was told, [...] "You are the first impressionist writer." [...] A recognized example of his mastery of impressionism is the novel's opening scene where all the characters meet at the station.|$|E
500|$|According to American critic Robert Christgau, Maxinquayes groove-oriented and low-tempo music drew {{not only}} on dub but also on lo-fi, ambient techno, and hip hop, while James Hunter from Rolling Stone said Tricky subsumed American hip hop, soul, reggae, and 1980s English rock sounds into [...] "a mercurial style of dance music". Entertainment Weekly critic David Browne {{classified}} the music as an intellectual form of R. Ben Walsh of The Independent called it an experimental album featuring a [...] "heady blend" [...] of soul, rock, punk, hip hop, dub, and electronica. In Tricky's own words, he composed his songs based on a particular sound he liked rather than having a definite song structure in mind: [...] "I couldn't write you a blues track or a hip-hop track if you asked. I just make what I hear and then me and Martina sing all <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>on</b> paper, putting {{the emphasis on the}} things that perhaps shouldn't be sung." [...] Tricky had no concept of pitch, regard for notational conventions and time signatures, or previous experience with sampling, but his approach for Maxinquaye challenged Saunders to rethink his ideas about music production and experiment in ways he had never tried before. Saunders recalled being asked to combine samples of two songs that were 30 beats per minute apart and composed in entirely different keys: [...] " [...] thought differently to anybody I've ever known ... It didn't occur to me that by de-tuning one to slow it down, both might then gel musically at that point. I always think of it like going into a scrapyard and building a car out of all the bits you can find. You could probably build a car that would work, and although it might be the ugliest you've ever seen, it would have loads of character." ...|$|E
