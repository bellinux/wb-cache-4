5|$|Iguanodon was {{recorded}} from Africa based on teeth from Tunisia {{and elsewhere in}} the Sahara, but <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> Lurdusaurus and Ouranosaurus cast doubt on African records of Iguanodon. The genus was also recorded from Mongolia based on <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> I. orientalis, and in North America based on I. ottingeri from Utah. Another North American species, from South Dakota, once assigned to Iguanodon as I. lakotaensis, has since been reclassified as the genus Dakotadon.|$|E
5|$|The Chronologia {{developed}} into an even wider project, the Cosmographia, {{a description of}} the whole Universe. Mercator's outline was (1) the creation of the world; (2) <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the heavens (astronomy and astrology); (3) <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the earth comprising modern geography, the geography of Ptolemy and the geography of the ancients; (4) genealogy and history of the states; and (5) chronology. Of these the chronology had already been accomplished, the account of the creation and the modern maps would appear in the atlas of 1595, his edition of Ptolemy appeared in 1578 but the ancient geography and <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the heavens never appeared.|$|E

5|$|A 2008 {{molecular}} phylogenetic study clarified {{the relationships}} among the mushroom-forming species of the family.

5|$|All {{specimens}} discovered until 1967 were in coarse-grained sandstone {{that prevented}} preservation of fine details, making interpretation difficult. S.B.

5|$|In 1847, Hodgson {{described}} a red panda {{under the name}} Ailurus ochraceus, of which Pocock concluded it represents the same type as Ailurus fulgens, since <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the two agree very closely.
