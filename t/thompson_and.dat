5|$|<b>Thompson</b> <b>and</b> Russell {{found another}} {{evolutionary}} lineage that originates in a glacially restricted {{area of the}} Salmon River Mountains, Idaho. With {{the arrival of the}} Holocene interglacial, approximately 10,000 years ago, the Pleistocene glaciers receded and opened a migratory path linking these southern populations to northern areas where they currently overlap with A. m. krausei and co-migrated north into the Peace River (Canada) Valley. Ferguson also noted an intergradation in the same geographic area, but between the morphological subspecies A. m. columbianum and A. m. kraisei that run parallel to the Bitterroot and Selkirk ranges. <b>Thompson</b> <b>and</b> Russell suggest that this contact zone is between two different subspecies lineages because the A. m. columbianum lineage is geographically isolated and restricted to the central Oregon Mountains.|$|E
