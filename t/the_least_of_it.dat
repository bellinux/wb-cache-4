[...] Subsequent histories, including William Laird Clowes' book of 1900 and Richard Woodman's of 2001 follow James, but in his 1837 reprint Brenton defended the account and named Alexander Robert Kerr, second lieutenant of Boston during the action, as his source. In the same year a magazine article written by a niece of Captain Courtenay continued to repeat the allegations, stating that [...] "the treacherous or – to say <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> – the improper and unprofessional conduct of Lieutenant Edwards" [...] had been responsible for his commander's death.|$|E

She grew up in a racially diverse {{neighborhood}} in the 1970s and 1980s, which she described as a community of [...] "old hippies, ex-druggies, burn-outs from the 1960s, drag queens, Chinese people, and Koreans.

The words of Socrates {{are the only ones}} to have ever upset him so deeply that his soul started to realize that his aristocratic life was no better than a slave's (215e). Socrates is the only man who has ever made Alcibiades feel shame (216b). Yet all this is <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> (216c)- Socrates is mad about {{beautiful}} boys, following them around in a daze (216d).

2500|$|Manley became well-known, even notorious, as a novel {{with the}} {{publication}} of her roman à clef, the New Atalantis in 1709, a work that spotted present British politics on the fabulous Mediterranean Island. [...] Contemporary critics like Swift might consider that her caricatures missed the mark much more often than they hit it; but a historian like G. M. Trevelyan would at least rate her portrait of Godolphin as a telling one: “...the greatest genius of his age with <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in his aspect. The affairs of a nation in his head, with a pair of cards or a box of dice in his hand”.|$|E
