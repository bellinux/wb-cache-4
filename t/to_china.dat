5|$|After US President Richard Nixon {{made his}} famous 1972 visit <b>to</b> <b>China,</b> {{a wave of}} exchanges took place between the two countries. One of these was a {{delegation}} of the American Institute of Architects in 1974, which Pei joined. It was his first trip back <b>to</b> <b>China</b> since leaving in 1935. He was favorably received, returned the welcome with positive comments, {{and a series of}} lectures ensued. Pei noted in one lecture that since the 1950s Chinese architects had been content to imitate Western styles; he urged his audience in one lecture to search China's native traditions for inspiration.|$|E

In 1921 Matsui was posted to Siberia as a staff officer, but returned in 1922 <b>to</b> <b>China</b> where he served until 1924 as an advisor to Zhang Zuolin in the Manchurian city of Harbin and did intelligence work for Japan's Kwantung Army.|$|E

40|$|The paper applies Cobb-Douglas Production Function and So low-Swan Model to {{constructing}} the calculation {{model of the}} contribution rate of cultivated land occupation by construction (CLOC) <b>to</b> <b>China's</b> economic growth, and analyzes the contribution change of CLOC <b>to</b> <b>China's</b> economic growth qualitatively and quantitatively. The main conclusions are as follows: 1) From 1989 to 2007, the contribution rates of capital, labor, and CLOC <b>to</b> <b>China's</b> economic growth were 45. 76 %, 8. 47 %, and 6. 19 % respectively. 2) From the period 1989 - 1996 to the period 1997 - 2007 the contribution rate of CLOC <b>to</b> <b>China's</b> economic growth increased from 5. 40 % to 5. 87 %. The degree of contribution was enhanced significantly. 3) The contribution of CLOC <b>to</b> <b>China's</b> economic growth had a spatial distribution characteristic that the contribution rate of eastern coastal regions was the highest, that of central regions came second, and that of western regions the lowest. The paper indicates {{that in order to}} enhance the contribution of CLOC <b>to</b> <b>China's</b> economic growth, some relevant economic and administrative measures might be taken, and land might be used intensively and economically to increase land economic density. The cost of promoting gross domestic product (GDP) growth might be reduced as much as possible to achieve higher GDP growth and lower land resource consumption...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the overseas risks <b>to</b> <b>China’s</b> energy security and provides suggestions for how <b>to</b> safeguard <b>China’s</b> energy security. The key <b>to</b> <b>China’s</b> energy security is supply security. This means obtaining enough and continued energy supply at affordable prices {{which can be}} divided into two factors: one is purchasing energy at reasonable prices; the other is having uninterrupted energy import. Accordingly, the major overseas challenges <b>to</b> <b>China’s</b> energy security are the surging international oil prices and the problem of safeguarding energy imports. There are both merits and shortcomings to the energy security concept of realism and that of neo-liberalism. Suggestions for how <b>to</b> secure <b>China’s</b> energy supply should be based on China’s conditions as well as a critique of the two theoretical perspectives and should include three aspects: energy diplomacy, military development and strategic oil reserves...|$|R
