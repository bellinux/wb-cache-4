5|$|<b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> {{from the}} {{ionosphere}} to the plasma sheet is especially strong when the corresponding {{part of the}} plasma sheet rotates slower than the planet. As mentioned above, co-rotation breaks down in the region located between 20 and 40RJ from Jupiter. This region corresponds to the magnetodisk, where the magnetic field is highly stretched. The strong direct current flowing into the magnetodisk originates in a very limited latitudinal range of about ° from the Jovian magnetic poles. These narrow circular regions correspond to Jupiter's main auroral ovals. (See below.) The return current flowing from the outer magnetosphere beyond 50RJ enters the Jovian ionosphere near the poles, closing the electrical circuit. The total radial current in the Jovian magnetosphere is estimated at 60 million–140million amperes.|$|E
25|$|Coaxial cables are {{commonly}} used at audio frequencies and above for convenience. A coaxial cable has a conductive wire inside a conductive tube, separated by a dielectric layer. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> {{on the surface of}} the inner conductor is equal and opposite to <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> on the inner surface of the outer tube. The electromagnetic field is thus completely contained within the tube, and (ideally) no energy is lost to radiation or coupling outside the tube. Coaxial cables have acceptably small losses for frequencies up to about 5GHz. For microwave frequencies greater than 5GHz, the losses (due mainly to the electrical resistance of the central conductor) become too large, making waveguides a more efficient medium for transmitting energy. Coaxial cables with an air rather than solid dielectric are preferred as they transmit power with lower loss.|$|E

For discussion, a light source illuminates a plate P, and another plate electrode Q collects any emitted electrons.

40|$|The {{computation}} of nodes centrality is {{of great}} importance {{for the analysis of}} graphs. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> betweenness is an interesting centrality index that is computed by considering how the information travels along all the possible paths of a graph. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> betweenness exploits basic results from electrical circuits, i. e. Kirchhoff 2 ̆ 7 s laws, to evaluate the centrality of vertices. The computation of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> betweenness may exceed the computational capability of a single machine for very large graphs composed by millions of nodes. In this paper we propose a solution that estimates <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> betweenness in a distributed setting, by defining a vertex-centric, gossip-based algorithm. Each node, relying on its local information, in a self-adaptive way generates new flows to improve the betweenness of all the nodes of the graph. Our experimental evaluation shows that our proposal achieves high correlation with <b>the</b> exact <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> betweenness, and provides a good centrality measure for large graphs...|$|R

25|$|A modern {{electrometer}} is {{a highly}} sensitive electronic voltmeter whose input impedance is so high that <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> into it can be considered, for most practical purposes, to be zero. The actual value of input resistance for modern electronic electrometers is around 1014Ω, compared to around 1010Ω for nanovoltmeters. Owing to the extremely high input impedance, special design considerations must be applied to avoid leakage current such as driven shields and special insulation materials.|$|E
25|$|Electrically, RO is a {{resistance}} controlled by <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> through the light source. In the dark state, the resistance typically exceeds a few MOhm; when illuminated, it decreases as the inverse {{of the light}} intensity. In contrast to the photodiode and phototransistor, the photoresistor can operate in both the AC and DC circuits and have a voltage of several hundred volts across it. The harmonic distortions of the output current by the RO are typically within 0.1% at voltages below 0.5 V.|$|E

5000|$|A {{nanoscale}} vacuum-channel transistor (NVCT) is a transistor {{in which}} the electron transport medium is a vacuum. In a tradition solid-state transistor, a semiconductor channel exists between the source and the drain, and <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> through <b>the</b> semiconductor. However, in a nanoscale vacuum-channel transistor, no material exists between the source and the drain, and therefore, <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> through <b>the</b> vacuum.|$|R

25|$|A {{thermocouple}} {{can produce}} current to drive some processes directly, {{without the need}} for extra circuitry and power sources. For example, the power from a thermocouple can activate a valve when a temperature difference arises. The electrical energy generated by a thermocouple is converted from the heat which must be supplied to the hot side to maintain the electric potential. A continuous transfer of heat is necessary because <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> through the thermocouple tends to cause the hot side to cool down and the cold side to heat up (the Peltier effect).|$|E
25|$|Jaroslav Heyrovský, a Nobel laureate, {{eliminated}} the tedious weighing required by previous analytical techniques, which used the differential precipitation of mercury by measuring drop-time. In the previous method, a voltage {{was applied to}} a dropping mercury electrode and a reference electrode was immersed in a test solution. After 50 drops of mercury were collected, they were dried and weighed. The applied voltage was varied and the experiment repeated. Measured weight was plotted versus applied voltage to obtain the curve. In 1921, Heyrovský had the idea of measuring <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> through the cell instead of just studying drop-time.|$|E
25|$|From 1953 the US had {{increasingly}} {{concentrated on}} the fast pinch concept. Some of these machines had produced neutrons, and these were initially associated with fusion. There was so much excitement that several other researchers quickly entered the field as well. Among these was Stirling Colgate, but his experiments quickly led him to conclude that fusion was not taking place. According to M-theory, the only theoretical study of high-power plasmas at the time, {{the temperature of the}} plasma could be determined from <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> through it. When Colgate ran the calculation, the temperatures in the plasma were far below the requirements for fusion.|$|E

50|$|Another {{option is}} to have a DPDT relay to set <b>the</b> {{direction}} of <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> and a transistor to enable <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>flow.</b> This can extend the relay life, as the relay will be switched while the transistor is off and thereby there is no <b>current</b> <b>flow.</b> It also enables the use of PWM switching to control <b>the</b> <b>current</b> level.|$|R
30|$|The {{bottom panel}} of Fig.  2 shows <b>the</b> <b>current</b> density, that is, <b>the</b> {{electric}} <b>current</b> per unit area. <b>The</b> westward <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> in <b>the</b> outer region, and the eastward one flows {{in the inner}} region. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> density also shows the asymmetric distribution during the main phase, {{which is consistent with}} the observation (Le et al. 2004). Because of the dipolar geometry, the cross-sectional area of the outer region where <b>the</b> westward <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> is larger than the inner region where <b>the</b> eastward <b>current</b> <b>flows.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> net <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> westward is larger than that flowing eastward (Ebihara and Ejiri 2000). The dominance of <b>the</b> net westward <b>current</b> causes <b>the</b> decrease in the geomagnetic field on the ground.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} Enigma rotors, each rotor drum of the bombe had two complete sets of contacts, one for input towards the reflector {{and the other}} for output from the reflector, so that the reflected signal could pass back through a separate set of contacts. Each drum had 104 wire brushes, which made contact with the plate onto which they were loaded. The brushes and the corresponding set of contacts on the plate were arranged in four concentric circles of 26. The outer pair of circles (input and output) were equivalent to the current in an Enigma passing in one direction through the scrambler, and the inner pair equivalent to <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> in the opposite direction.|$|E
25|$|All the {{electromagnetic}} motors, {{and that includes}} the types mentioned here derive the torque from the vector product of the interacting fields. For calculating the torque it is necessary to know the fields in the air gap. Once these have been established by mathematical analysis using FEA or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current. This makes the calculation difficult but a computer can do the many calculations needed.|$|E
25|$|Planar {{magnetic}} speakers (having printed or embedded conductors {{on a flat}} diaphragm) {{are sometimes}} described as ribbons, but are not truly ribbon speakers. The term planar is generally reserved for speakers with roughly rectangular flat surfaces that radiate in a bipolar (i.e., front and back) manner. Planar magnetic speakers consist of a flexible membrane with a voice coil printed or mounted on it. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> through the coil interacts with the magnetic field of carefully placed magnets {{on either side of}} the diaphragm, causing the membrane to vibrate more or less uniformly and without much bending or wrinkling. The driving force covers a large percentage of the membrane surface and reduces resonance problems inherent in coil-driven flat diaphragms.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps are {{negative}} differential resistance devices, so as more <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> through them, <b>the</b> electrical {{resistance of the}} fluorescent lamp drops, allowing for even more <b>current</b> to <b>flow.</b> Connected directly to a constant-voltage power supply, a fluorescent lamp would rapidly self-destruct due to <b>the</b> uncontrolled <b>current</b> <b>flow.</b> To prevent this, fluorescent lamps must use an auxiliary device, a ballast, to regulate <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> through <b>the</b> lamp.|$|R

25|$|A carbon {{microphone}}, {{also known}} as a carbon button microphone (or sometimes just a button microphone), uses a capsule or button containing carbon granules pressed between two metal plates like the Berliner and Edison microphones. A voltage is applied across the metal plates, causing a small current to flow through the carbon. One of the plates, the diaphragm, vibrates in sympathy with incident sound waves, applying a varying pressure to the carbon. The changing pressure deforms the granules, causing the contact area between each pair of adjacent granules to change, and this causes the electrical resistance of the mass of granules to change. The changes in resistance cause a corresponding change in <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> through the microphone, producing the electrical signal. Carbon microphones were once commonly used in telephones; they have extremely low-quality sound reproduction and a very limited frequency response range, but are very robust devices. The Boudet microphone, which used relatively large carbon balls, was similar to the granule carbon button microphones.|$|E
