Specifically <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> <b>during</b> the satellite era since 1979 include Atlantic and Indian Ocean warming and Pacific cooling associated with phase shifts of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and enhanced global monsoon (GM) circulation and rainfall {{especially in the}} Northern Hemisphere. Here we evaluate effects of the oceanic changes on the global and regional monsoon trends by partial ocean temperature restoring experiments in a coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation model. Via trans-basin atmosphere–ocean teleconnections, the Atlantic warming drives a global pattern of sea surface temperature change that resembles observations, giving rise to the enhanced GM. The tropical Atlantic warming and the resultant Indian Ocean warming favor subtropical deep-tropospheric warming in both hemispheres, resulting in the enhanced monsoon circulations and precipitation over North America, South America and North Africa. The extratropical North Atlantic warming makes an additional contribution to the monsoon enhancement via Eurasian continent warming and resultant land–sea thermal gradient over Asia. The {{results of this study}} suggest that the Atlantic multidecadal variability can explain a substantial part of global climate variability including the recent decadal trends of GM...|$|E

In this study, the feasibility of vitrification, ice-free cryopreservation, for precultured ready-to-use TECs was evaluated. To prepare the TECs, bone marrow-derived porcine mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were seeded in polycaprolactone-gelatin nanofibrous scaffolds and cultured for 3 weeks before vitrification treatment. The vitrification strategy developed, which involved exposure of the TECs to low concentrations of cryoprotectants followed by a vitrification solution and sterile packaging in a pouch with its subsequent immersion directly into liquid nitrogen, was accomplished within 11 min. Stepwise removal of cryoprotectants, after warming in a 38 degrees C water bath, enabled rapid restoration of the TECs. Vitrification did not impair microstructure of the scaffold or cell viability. No {{significant differences were found}} between the vitrified and control TECs in cellular metabolic activity and proliferation on matched days and in <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> <b>during</b> 5 weeks of continuous culture postvitrification.

The YPLL rates decrease for 'all causes mortality', 'total avoidable causes' and 'road traffic injuries'. This trend can be observed during the four periods of 5 years. A slowing down of the decrease of the YPLL rates for road traffic injuries, both {{for men and women}} is observed: 11. 7 % between periods 2 and 1, and only 3 % between periods 4 and 3 for men (16. 2 and 7. 5 % for women).

40|$|In 1995, a National Health Insurance Law (NHIL) {{was enacted}} in Israel. It {{specified}} a mandatory package {{of services to}} be provided by the four competing private non-profit sickness funds, and secured the financing of that provision. This review discusses the main issues associated with financing of - and the sickness funds' expenditure on - the package of services and analyzes <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> <b>during</b> {{the first decade of}} the implementation of the NHIL. The main findings indicate that between 1995 and 2005 the "real value" of the budget of the package of services has eroded by more than a third, most of it being due to the under-updating with regard to technological advances. The steep rise in the co-payment paid by users of health services and in voluntary supplementary health insurance ownership which is offered by the sickness funds partially financed that erosion. The growth of private spending on health, including on voluntary supplementary insurance, took place in all population groups and in the lowest income-quintile in particular. Indices of the progressivity of the financing of the package of services indicate that the burden of financing has been slightly regressive. In spite of the increase in the share of the regressive private expenditure between 1997 and 2003, overall, the finance became less regressive due to the health tax becoming less regressive. In conclusion, the introduction of the Israeli NHIL was a promising social achievement, but, during its first decade and facing tight national budgets and receiving lower national priority, subsequent regulation eroded the real value of its benefits, and its principles of solidarity and equity in finance. After 10 years of experience, the system might need refreshment and policy amendments that will correspond to its original aspirations. ...|$|E

METHODS: A total of 1982 cases of CHD, which were not associated with a known chromosomal anomaly, were obtained from the Paris Registry of Congenital Malformations. Main outcome measures were trends in the proportions diagnosed and terminated before birth, stillbirth, and early (< 1 day, 1 -week) neonatal mortality for (1) all cases; (2) all cases excluding isolated ventricular septal defects; and (3) malformation-specific trends for transposition of great arteries, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, coarctation of aorta, and tetralogy of Fallot. Analyses included cusum and binomial regression models for analysis of <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> <b>during</b> 1983 - 2000. RESULTS: Prenatal diagnosis rates for CHD increased from 23. 0 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 19. 0 - 27. 4) in 1983 - 1988 to 47. 3 % (95 % CI: 43. 8 - 50. 8) in 1995 - 2000. Termination rates increased between 1983 and 1989 (9. 9 %; 95 % CI: 7. 2 - 13. 2) and 1989 and 1994 (14. 7 %; 95 % CI: 12. 3 - 17. 4) but seemed to remain stable thereafter. Other than for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, pregnancy termination was exceptional for the other 3 specific malformations examined. Early neonatal mortality decreased to less than one third in the period 1995 - 2000 as compared with 1983 - 1989 (risk ratio, first-week mortality: 0. 31; 95 % CI: 0. 18 - 0. 53). First-week mortality was significantly lower for cases of transposition of great arteries that were diagnosed before birth (risk difference: 15. 4 %; 95 % CI: 4. 0 - 26. 7).

40|$|Reconstructing ocean {{temperature}} values {{is a major}} target in paleoceanography and climate research. However, most temperature proxies are organism-based and thus suffer from an "ecological bias". Multiproxy approaches can potentially overcome this bias but typically require more investment in time and resources, while being susceptible to errors induced by sample preparation steps necessary before analysis. Three lipid-based temperature proxies are widely used: UK' 37 (based on long chain alkenones from phytoplanktonic haptophytes), TEX 86 [based on glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) from pelagic archaea] and LDI (based on long chain diols from phytoplanktonic eustigmatophytes). So far, separate analytical methods, including gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC), {{have been used to}} determine these proxies. Here we present a sensitive method for determining all three in a single normal phase high performance LC-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (NP-HPLC-APCI-MS) analysis. Each of the long chain alkenones and long chain diols was separated and unambiguously identified from the accurate masses and characteristic fragmentation during multiple stage MS analysis (MS 2). Comparison of conventional GC and HPLC-MS methods showed similar results for UK' 37 and LDI, respectively, using diverse environmental samples and an Emiliania huxleyi culture. Including the three sea surface temperature (SST) proxies; the NP-HPLC-APCI-MS method in fact allows simultaneous determination of nine paleoenvironmental proxies. The extent to which the ecology of the source organisms (ecological bias) influences lipid composition and thereby the reconstructed temperature values was demonstrated by applying the new method to a sediment core from the Sea of Marmara, covering the last 21 kyr BP. Reconstructed SST values differed considerably between the proxies for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the period of Sapropel S 1 formation at ca. 10 kyr BP, whereas <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> <b>during</b> the late Holocene were similar. Changes in the composition of alkenone-producing species at the transition from the LGM to the Bølling/Allerød (B/A) were inferred from unreasonably high UK' 37 -derived SST values (ca. 20 °C) during the LGM. We ascribe discrepancies between the reconstructed temperature records during S 1 deposition to habitat change, e. g. a different depth due to changes in nutrient availability...|$|E

Los resultados se estratificaron por grupos de edad. Las frecuencias de muertes por picaduras de alacrán se compararon mediante el riesgo relativo (RR) y sus intervalos de confianza de 95 % (IC 95 %). RESULTADOS: Entre 1979 y 2003, en México se registraron 6 077 muertes por picaduras de alacrán. Se observó una tendencia descendente estadísticamente significativa en la mortalidad estandarizada (beta = - 0, 195; P OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the trends in mortality from scorpion stings in Mexico {{as a whole}} and in each of its states for the period of 1979 to 2003. METHODS: We estimated the crude and standardized mortality rates due to scorpion stings and <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> <b>during</b> the period studied based on official mortality data for Mexico, using the codes (E 905. 2 and X 22, respectively) from the 9 th and 10 th editions of the International Classification of Diseases. The results were stratified by age group. The frequencies of deaths from scorpion stings were compared using relative risk (RR), with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Between 1979 and 2003 in Mexico, 6 077 deaths from scorpion stings were registered. A statistically significant downward trend was found in standardized mortality rates (beta = - 0. 195; P < 0. 001), with a total reduction of 86. 5 % for the period of 2001 - 2003 versus 1979 - 1982. For the 2001 - 2003 period, the highest mortality rates were in children under 1 year of age (7. 07 per 1 000 000), children 1 to 4 years old (3. 78 per 1 000 000), persons 60 and older (0. 84 per 1 000 000), and males (0. 81 per 1 000 000).

40|$|Eutrophication {{through the}} process of {{nutrient}} enrichment of stagnant waters due to urbanization & agricultural practices is becoming a significant water pollution issue in Sri Lanka. The appearance of thick Microcystis aeruginosa bloom in 1999 indicates that the Kandy Lake is also becoming the victim of nutrient enrichment. Therefore an effective Lake Management and Lake monitoring programmes with integrated catchment management have to be adopted and it is a prior necessity in planning of the management practices of the catchments to get firsthand information through research on trophic status of the lake. This study is focused on the evaluation of trophic status of the lake using Phytoplankton as indicators. The objectives of the study were to find out the species composition, variation of species richness & their diversity towards the trophic nature of Kandy lake through responses of the species towards different nutrient levels of the lake, and to develop different diversity index ranges which could be used as indicator levels of Lake Eutrophication, thus making it possible to determine the status of the water body through diversity index values. To achieve these objectives, the overall physico-chemical nature of the water body, was investigated by the parameters such as water level, water transparency, dissolved oxygen, temperature, conductivity, pH, alkalinity, nitrate, orthophosphate and biological nature by the parameters such as chlorophyll - a and the phytoplankton densities and species composition were determined. The laboratory experiments also were conducted using a series of diluted lake water as culture media to monitor the effect or Nitrate & Phosphate on indicator organisms. Sampling was carried out in Kandy Lake from October 2001 to March 2002 (six months), once a month during the day time. The total number of individual species collected at 08 selected stations at each depth surface, mid and bottom were quantified and the phytoplankton density was expressed as the number of cells per cubic meter of the lake water. These data were used in calculating diversity indices. During this study an attempt was made to develop a curve to predict the number of cells in a colony according {{to the size of the}} colony of Microcystis. According to the curve there were 20 cells per unit area (1 μm 2) of Microcystis colony. Low Secchi Depth value « 1 m) and high chlorophyll a concentration (100 - 250 mg/rn ') indicates Hyper-eutrophic nature of the Lake. High nutrient loading observed through out the study period (Average values of Nutrients varied between 204. 65 μg/L and 512. 95 μ/L for Orthophosphate and 0. 114 mg/L and 0. 243 mg/L for Nitrate) triggers that situation and it probably maximized by the mixing nature of the lake. Only a few (06) phytoplankton species were recorded in Kandy Lake during the study period; namely Microcystis aeruginosa. Microcystis incerta, Pediastrum duplex. Merismopedia tenuissima. Melosira granulata. Diatoma elongata. Out of them Mtc [...] . rocystis and Melosira were found in greater abundance indicating the eutrophic nature of the lake. The calculated diversity index values for water samples of entire Kandy Lake throughout the investigation period were below 10 According to previous studies diversity index 3 is clean water. Therefore values obtained for Kandy Lake indicates the eutrophicated status of the lake. Even during different seasons the values have never increased indicating permanent eutrophic status of Kandy Lake. The diversity index value of < I found for Kandy Lake could be used as a reference value to monitor <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> <b>during</b> restoration of the Lake. According to the physico chemical and biological observations of the present investigations, Kandy lake water is already eutrophic and therefore its bottom sediment may contain high nutrient concentrations adsorbed to the bottom sediment Therefore even if further nutrient inputs are controlled, the blooming could occur due to accumulated nutrient loads in the bottom and there is a need for quick remedial efforts if the Lake is to be saved from this bad situation. Diversity index values could be used as a monitoring tool in Management of Eutrophication in Kandy Lake even without time consuming and costly chemical analysis procedures...|$|E

Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) {{find that in}} the case of {{developing}} countries, productivity shocks explain an important portion of output fluctuations. On the other hand, the results of Rodríguez (2010 c) show that the variance of <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> component of Peruvian GDP is as important as the variance of the cyclical component, especially from 1990 onwards. Finally, although Perron (1989) and Perron and Wada (2009) propose a non-stochastic trend for most of the time, this goes in hand with structural changes in <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>during</b> some periods; however, this is not the case in the UC-C and the UC-CP models.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we discuss the}} {{evolutionary}} paths of industrial districts. We describe a specific case which illustrates an ‘anomalous’ path but is nevertheless of interest, given its possible replicability in other district contexts. In particular, we examine the evolutionary path of the tanning district of Arzignano, doing so by analysing {{the results of an}} empirical survey conducted in 2005. We dwell upon the reasons that have induced the majority of local actors to favour the developmental model which we call ‘reverse relocation’. This is a phenomenon that involves the large presence of immigrant workers and contrasts with <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1990 s, whereby Italian districts relocated some manufacturing activities to countries with low labour costs...|$|R
50|$|The chain-like {{arrangement}} of summits {{and the formation}} of long, jagged mountain crests - known in Spanish as sierras ("saws") - is a consequence of their collective formation by mountain building forces. The often linear structure is linked to the direction of these thrust forces and the resulting mountain folding which in turn relates to the fault lines in {{the upper part of the}} earth's crust, that run between the individual mountain chains. In these fault zones, the rock, which has sometimes been pulverised, is easily eroded, so that large river valleys are carved out. These, so called longitudinal valleys reinforce <b>the</b> <b>trend,</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> early mountain building phase, towards the formation of parallel chains of mountains.|$|R
