5|$|Mihardja, a journalist-cum-literary {{editor who}} {{associated}} with <b>the</b> <b>eccentric</b> poet Chairil Anwar and the Socialist Party of Indonesia, wrote Atheis from May 1948 to February 1949. The Indonesian {{used in the}} novel was influenced by Sundanese and harkens back to earlier works by Minang writers, as opposed to Mihardja's contemporaries who attempted {{to distance themselves from}} the earlier style. Dealing mainly with faith, the novel also touches on the interactions between modernity and traditionalism. Although the writer insisted that the work was meant to be realistic, symbolic representations from subjective meanings to the novel being an allegory have been advanced.|$|E
5|$|By 1926 Joyce had {{completed}} the first {{two parts of the}} book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine transition. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including {{the death of his father}} in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia, and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including Samuel Beckett. For some years, Joyce nursed <b>the</b> <b>eccentric</b> plan of turning over the book to his friend James Stephens to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.|$|E

5|$|Forging a {{collaboration}} with Scorsese, the two paired {{again for a}} biopic of <b>the</b> <b>eccentric</b> and obsessive American film director and aviation pioneer Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004). Centering on Hughes' life from the late 1920s to 1947, DiCaprio initially developed the project with Michael Mann, who decided against directing it after back-to-back film biographies in Ali and The Insider. The actor eventually pitched John Logan's script to Scorsese, who quickly signed on to direct. The Aviator became a critical and financial success. DiCaprio received rave reviews for his performance and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, also receiving another Academy Award nomination.|$|E
5|$|St. Paul, Minnesota: in a store, Clyde Bruckman (Peter Boyle), a life {{insurance}} salesman, purchases a {{paper and a}} lottery ticket and leaves. In the street, he almost bumps into an inconspicuous man (Stuart Charno), who heads to a gypsy palm reader named Madame Zelma (Karin Konoval). After seeking his fortune, the inconspicuous man attacks and kills her. A few days later, the eyes and entrails of a tea leaf reader, {{who was also a}} doll collector, have been found in her apartment, her body being missing. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive at the scene of that murder to help the local cops, who have recruited the help of a psychic, <b>the</b> <b>eccentric</b> Stupendous Yappi (Jaap Broeker). Although the psychic delivers extremely vague clues, the cops are thoroughly impressed; both Scully and Mulder, however, are not, especially after Yappi diagnoses that it is Mulder—not Scully—who is a skeptic.|$|E
5|$|The Boggs' {{neighbors are}} curious about their new house guest, and the Boggs throw a {{neighborhood}} barbecue welcoming Edward. Most {{of the neighbors}} are fascinated by Edward and befriend him, except for <b>the</b> <b>eccentric</b> religious fanatic Esmeralda and Kim's boyfriend Jim. Edward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into topiaries. This leads him to discover he can groom dogs' hair, and later he styles the hair of the neighborhood women. One of the neighbors, Joyce, offers to help Edward open a hair salon. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce Edward, but scares him away. Joyce tells the neighborhood women that he attempted to seduce her, reducing their trust in him. The bank refuses to give Edward a loan as {{he does not have}} a background or financial history.|$|E

40|$|Tobias Smollet's {{purpose in}} writing was twofold: to {{entertain}} the reader and to satirize man and his society. To accomplish his aim, <b>the</b> author created <b>eccentric</b> personalities in <b>the</b> old Elizabethan humour convention. This thesis looks at Smollet's characterizations, especially of <b>the</b> <b>eccentrics,</b> in his novels...|$|R
5|$|The Mint then struck silver or gold in {{response}} to deposits by those holding bullion, and made little profit from those transactions. By the 1840s, profits, or seignorage, from monetizing copper into cents helped fund the Mint. In 1849, copper prices rose sharply, causing the Department of the Treasury to investigate possible alternatives to the large one-cent pieces. The cent was unpopular in trade; as {{it was not a}} legal tender, nobody had to take it, and banks and merchants often refused it. The cent was disliked for its large size as well. In 1837, <b>the</b> <b>eccentric</b> New York chemist Lewis Feuchtwanger had experimented with a smaller cent size in making model coins as part of a plan to sell his alloy (similar to base-metal German silver) to the government for use in coinage. His pieces circulated as hard times tokens in the recession years of the late 1830s and early 1840s.|$|E
5|$|Western RPGs changed {{following}} this period. Non-player characters were given more dialogue, as in Baldur's Gate, party sizes became smaller, as in Fallout, and combat became faster, as in Diablo. Games became more accessible. Their feel became more cinematic rather than novelistic, and {{they focused on}} a single player-made character who progressed through the game as the player's sole avatar. Video games became darker and more thematically consistent. Designers abandoned or reconciled some of <b>the</b> <b>eccentric</b> elements and pastiche of the 8-bit and 16-bit titles. Diablo, for instance, displayed a consistent Gothic style throughout the series, and the Elder Scrolls series downplayed its cat- and lizard-people {{in favor of the}} more recognizable Dark Elves and Nords.|$|E
5|$|The Liberty Head nickel was {{replaced}} after 1912, and initially {{there was no}} indication that 1913-dated pieces with that design existed. In December 1919, a coin dealer, Samuel W. Brown, placed advertisements in coin publications, offering to buy 1913 Liberty Head nickels. The following August, Brown appeared at the annual American Numismatic Association (ANA) convention bearing such a piece. Brown claimed that a master die had been prepared for 1913 and that these pieces had been run off to test it. As it turned out, Brown possessed five coins, which he eventually sold. After spending fifteen years in the hands of <b>the</b> <b>eccentric</b> Col. E.H.R. Green, the famous Fort Worth, Texas, area collector, the coins were finally dispersed in 1943. Since then, they have had several owners each. Today, two are on public display—at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the ANA's Money Museum in Colorado Springs, while three are owned privately. The most recent sale of a 1913 Liberty Head nickel was in January 2010, when one sold for $3,737,500 in an auction.|$|E

25|$|In {{the single}} toggle jaw crushers, the swing jaw is {{suspended}} on <b>the</b> <b>eccentric</b> shaft {{which leads to}} a much more compact design than that of the double toggle jaw crusher. The swing jaw, suspended on <b>the</b> <b>eccentric,</b> undergoes two types of motion- swing motion towards the fixed jaw due to the action of toggle plate and vertical movement due the rotation of <b>the</b> <b>eccentric.</b> These two motions, when combined, lead to an elliptical jaw motion. This motion is useful as it assists in pushing the particles through the crushing chamber. This phenomenon leads to higher capacity of the single toggle jaw crushers but it also results in higher wear of the crushing jaws. These type of jaw crushers are preferred for the crushing of softer particles.|$|E
5000|$|Both top {{and bottom}} {{eccentric}} weights play {{a big role in}} sorting a ratio of coarse versus fine products.

40|$|In Chinese history, few personalities {{compare to}} <b>the</b> Chan <b>eccentrics.</b> These legendary, {{exceptional}} monks, including the friends Hanshan and Shide, their teacher Fenggan, and Budai, supposedly dwelled {{in the mountains}} and cities of southeast China between the seventh and tenth centuries. Dressed in rags, the monks spoke and acted in extraordinary ways. <b>The</b> <b>eccentrics</b> represented qualities that were valued by various social and religious groups, most prominently the Chan (also known as Zen, after its Japanese translation) establishment. In the Song and Yuan dynasties (960 - 1368), the monks appear throughout Chan texts, and they become a popular and recurring theme in art. This study investigates the theme of <b>the</b> Chan <b>eccentrics</b> in <b>the</b> art and culture of the Song and the Yuan. It focuses on the role of <b>the</b> <b>eccentrics</b> and their visual representations for Chan Buddhism, while also paying attention to the interpretation of this theme in other traditions, and in forms of art that are not generally associated with Chan. The study shows how the translation of this theme in texts and art questions long-held notions in the fields of Chinese Studies, Art History and Chan Studies, including definitions of “religious tradition”, “portraiture” and “Chan art”.
