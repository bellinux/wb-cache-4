On 7October 1946, Sjahrir and the former Dutch Prime Minister, Wim Schermerhorn, agreed to work towards a ceasefire. <b>The</b> <b>discussions</b> were to be moderated by the British diplomat Lord Killearn and involved Sudirman. He took a specially commissioned train to Jakarta, departing on 20October. However, he ordered it to return to Yogyakarta when Dutch troops refused to allow him and his men to enter the city with their weapons, feeling that such an order violated his sense of honour; the Dutch apologised, construing the events as a misunderstanding. Sudirman took another train in late October, arriving at Gambir Station in Jakarta on 1November, where he was greeted by large crowds. <b>The</b> <b>discussions</b> in Jakarta resulted in the drafting of the Linggadjati Agreement on 15 November; the agreement was ratified on 25March 1947, despite heavy opposition from Indonesian nationalists.

40|$|After {{teaching}} {{online for}} several semesters, I became increasingly frustrated with {{not seeing the}} value of having discussion board assignments.

I decided to try something new. I began reading all of <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> board posts (and replies) I would pull together common themes and common issues that arouse from <b>the</b> <b>discussion.</b> I would then write and send out a “summary paper” to the entire class about <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> board for all students to read. I would clear up any misconceptions that I found in <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> and would end the paper with a section on my thoughts on the topic. I would invite the students to further engage in <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> with me if they were interested via email. My student’s response to this process was overwhelmingly positive.

40|$|This Master's thesis {{focuses on}} <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> about Chinese and Western Medicine in the Duli pinglun Magazine (獨立評論) {{in the year}} of 1934. Its main purpose is to {{introduce}} the lines of reasoning of its participants. The thesis introduces general historical and philosophical background crucial for the formation of <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> about Chinese and Wester Medicine in 1930 s. It describes the situation of Chinese medicine in China from the late imperial period to so called Nanjing Decade (1928 - 1937). It describes <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> in <b>the</b> context of <b>the</b> intellectual <b>discussion</b> about social Darwinism, national essence, cultural iconoclasm and science and scientism. It introduces selected basic characteristics of Chinese Medicine crucial for the understanding of this <b>discussion.</b> <b>The</b> main actor of <b>the</b> <b>discussion,</b> Fu Sinian 傅斯年 (1896 - 1950), and the Duli pinglun Magazine itself are introduced here. The thesis focuses also on the first phase of <b>the</b> <b>discussion,</b> which was held in the Da gongbao Magazine 大公報.

5|$|The novel extrapolates Balzac's {{analysis}} of desire {{from the individual}} to society; he feared that the world, like Valentin, was losing its way due to material excess and misguided priorities. In the gambling house, the orgiastic feast, the antique shop, and <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> with men of science, Balzac examines this dilemma in various contexts. The lust for social status to which Valentin is led by Rastignac is emblematic of this excess; the gorgeous but unattainable Foedora symbolizes the pleasures offered by high society.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} inquiry {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} future use of the pipelines, and took evidence from the various stakeholders, most of whom presented the case that favored their companies or industry. The inquiry concluded that the pipelines should be sold for continued use in transporting petroleum. An auction for the pipelines was announced in 1946, {{which was designed to}} give preference to bidders who intended to use them for moving petroleum. 16 bids were received, with the highest cash bidders being companies hoping to use the pipelines for natural gas. Assessing the different bids proved difficult and <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> became enmeshed in national politics, with companies seeking support from various Washington politicians. Meanwhile, a threatened national coal strike raised concerns over the availability of natural gas, strengthening the arguments of the natural gas lobby.|$|E

5|$|At the convention, held August 5–8, Agnew {{abandoned}} his favorite son status, placing Nixon's name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination {{on the first}} ballot. In <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> that followed about a running mate, Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions thought they could influence his choice: Strom Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina, told a party meeting that he held a veto on the vice presidency. It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there was little enthusiasm when he first proposed Agnew, and other possibilities were discussed. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates {{was little more than}} a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of advisers and party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for the vice presidency later that day, before adjourning.|$|E
5|$|Crucially, {{both the}} Wartburg rally in 1817 and the Hambach Festival in 1832 had lacked any {{clear-cut}} program of unification.

Held together only by the idea of unification, their notions of how to achieve this did not include specific plans but instead rested on the nebulous idea that the Volk (the people), if properly educated, would bring about unification on their own. Grand speeches, flags, exuberant students, and picnic lunches did not translate into a new political, bureaucratic, or administrative apparatus.
