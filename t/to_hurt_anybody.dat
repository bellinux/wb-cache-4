Rockstar also released exclusive merchandise, limited editions and pre-order bonuses such as official soundtracks, a Piggsy figure, and a handheld voice changer. During {{the release of the}} first game, a former Rockstar employee admitted that the game almost caused a mutiny in the company, saying that the team [...] had [...] "already weathered plenty of controversy over GTA III and —we were no strangers to it—but Manhunt felt different.

You could play completely ethically if you wanted, and the game was parody anyway, so lighten up". The game became available through the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on May 14, 2013, and for the PlayStation 4 on March 22, 2016.|$|E

2500|$|Consistently {{cited as}} one of football's meanest, toughest, and most feared players, Butkus was renown for his intimidating profile and style of play. He was known to snarl at the {{opposition}} prior to plays. Quarterbacks would complain of Butkus biting them in pileups. Lions tight end Charlie Sanders recalled Butkus poking him in the eyes with {{his fingers through his}} face mask. He once intercepted a pass from Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton near the goal line, and instead of taking the ball into the end zone for an easy touchdown, he took aim at Tarkenton to run him over. When asked by a reporter if he was as the rumors suggested, he replied, [...] "I'm not so mean. I wouldn't ever go out <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>anybody</b> deliberately.

2500|$|One {{of the key}} {{witnesses}} to testify {{on behalf of the}} prosecution was the Reverend Elizabeth Cobbs—Chambliss's own niece. Reverend Cobbs stated that her uncle had repeatedly informed her he had been engaged in what he referred to as a [...] "one-man battle" [...] against blacks since the 1940s. Moreover, Cobbs testified on November 16 that, on the day before the bombing, Chambliss had informed her he had in his possession enough dynamite to [...] "flatten half of Birmingham". Cobbs also testified that, approximately one week after the bombing, she had observed Chambliss watching a news article relating to the four girls killed in the bombing. According to Cobbs, Chambliss had informed her: [...] "It [...] wasn't meant <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>anybody</b> ... it didn't go off when it was supposed to." [...] Another witness to testify was a man named William Jackson, who testified as to his joining the Ku Klux Klan in 1963 and his becoming acquainted with Chambliss shortly thereafter. Jackson testified that Chambliss had expressed frustration as to his (Chambliss's) belief that the Klan was [...] "dragging its feet" [...] on the issue of racial integration, and of his eagerness to form a more virulent splinter group.|$|E

5000|$|Three {{weeks to}} the day after Kennedy's assassination, the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee gave Dylan their annual Tom Paine award for his {{contribution}} to the civil rights movement. Dylan gave an acceptance speech at the awards ceremony held at Hotel Americana in New York.

I want to accept it in my name but I'm not really accepting it in my name and I'm not accepting it in any kind of group's name, any Negro group or any other kind of group. There are Negroes - I was on the march on Washington up on the platform and I looked around at all the Negroes there and I didn't see any Negroes that looked like none of my friends. My friends don't wear suits. My friends don't have to wear suits. My friends don't have to wear any kind of thing to prove that they're respectable Negroes. My friends are my friends, and they're kind, gentle people if they're my friends. And I'm {{not going to try to}} push nothing over. So, I accept this reward - not reward, (Laughter) award in behalf of Phillip Luce who led the group to Cuba which all people should go down to Cuba. I don't see why anybody can't go to Cuba. I don't see what's going <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> by going any place. I don't know what's going <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>anybody's</b> eyes <b>to</b> see anything. On the other hand, Phillip is a friend of mine who went to Cuba. I'll stand up and to get uncompromisable about it, which I have to be to be honest, I just got to be, as I got to admit that the man who shot President Kennedy, Lee Oswald, I don't know exactly where … what he thought he was doing, but I got to admit honestly that I too - I saw some of myself in him. I don't think it would have gone - I don't think it could go that far. But I got to stand up and say I saw things that he felt, in me - not to go that far and shoot. (Boos and hisses) You can boo but booing's got nothing to do with it. It's a - I just a - I've got to tell you, man, it's Bill of Rights is free speech and I just want to admit that I accept this Tom Paine Award in behalf of James Forman of the Students Non-Violent Coordinating Committee and on behalf of the people who went to Cuba.
