40|$|A Long Duration Test (LDT) was {{initiated}} in June 2005 {{as a part}} of NASA's Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT) service life validation approach. Testing was voluntarily terminated in February 2014, with the thruster accumulating 51, 184 hours of operation, processing 918 kg of xenon propellant, and delivering 35. 5 MN-s of total impulse. The post-test inspection objectives for the ion optics were derived from the original NEXT LDT test objectives, such as service life model validation, and expanded to encompass other goals that included verification of in situ measurements, test issue root causes, and past design changes. The ion optics cold grid gap had decreased only by an average of 7 % of pretest center grid gap, so efforts to stabilize NEXT grid gap were largely successful. The upstream screen grid surface exhibited a chamfered erosion pattern. Screen grid thicknesses were 86 % of the estimated pretest thickness, indicating that the screen grid has substantial service life remaining. Deposition was found on the screen aperture walls and downstream surfaces that was primarily composed of grid material and back-sputtered carbon, and this deposition likely caused the minor decreases in screen grid ion transparency during the <b>test.</b> <b>Groove</b> depths had eroded through up to 35 % of the accelerator grid thickness. Minimum accelerator aperture diameters increased only by about 5 - 7 % of the pretest values and downstream surface diameters increased by about 24 - 33 % of the pretest diameters. These results suggest that increasing the accelerator aperture diameters, improving manufacturing tolerances, and masking down the perforated diameter to 36 cm were successful in reducing the degree of accelerator aperture erosion at larger radii...|$|E

Using a repeated-measures randomized blind design, experimenters exposed 12 subjects to four treatment combinations. These included: room air for 90 minutes (baseline); 100 % oxygen for 90 minutes; nitrous oxide-oxygen sedation for 90 minutes followed by 100 % oxygen for 2 minutes; and 90 minutes of nitrous oxide-oxygen sedation followed by 10 minutes of 100 % oxygen. Following each treatment, {{participants were asked}} to perform six standard neuropsychological tests together with a rating scale measurement where subjects self-evaluated their respective levels of alertness. The tests were: digit span; digit symbol; paced auditory serial addition; controlled word association; letter cancellation; and grooved pegboard. Two-way analysis of variance revealed significant differences between mean scores for treatments on only two <b>tests,</b> <b>grooved</b> pegboard (P less than 0. 05) and controlled word association (P less than 0. 05). There was also a significant difference in mean scores obtained for the rating scale (P less than 0. 001).

40|$|Background: We {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} chemical disinfection and accelerated aging on the dimensional stability and detail reproduction of a silicone elastomer containing one of two opacifiers. Methods: A total of 90 samples were fabricated from Silastic MDX 4 - 4210 silicone and divided into groups (n = 10) according to opacifier content (barium sulfate or titanium dioxide) and disinfectant solution (neutral soap, Efferdent, or 4 % chlorhexidine). The specimens were disinfected 3 times per week during 60 days and then subjected to accelerated aging for 1008 hours. Dimensional stability and detail reproduction tests were performed after specimens' fabrication (baseline), chemical disinfection and periodically during accelerated aging (252, 504, and 1008 hours). The results were analyzed using 3 -way repeated-measures ANOVA and the Tukey HSD test (alpha = 0. 05). Results: All groups exhibited dimensional changes over time. The opacifier (p =. 314), period (p <. 0001) and their interactions (p =. 0041) affected the dimensional stability of the silicone. Statistical significant dimensional differences occurred between groups with (0. 071) and without opacifiers (0. 053). Accelerated aging influenced the dimensional stability of the samples. All groups scored 2 in the detail reproduction tests, which represents the fully reproducing of three <b>test</b> <b>grooves</b> with accurate angles. Conclusions: Incorporation of opacifiers alters the dimensional stability of silicones used in facial prosthetics, but {{seems to have no}} influence on detail reproduction. Accelerated aging is responsible for most of the dimensional changes in Silastic MDX 4 4210, but all dimensional changes measured in this study remained within the limits of stability necessary for this application...|$|R

We evaluated this therapy in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. MethodsSixty-four patients were prospectively randomized to group A (n = 31; atmospheric air, 1. 5 atmospheres absolute) or group B (n = 33; hyperbaric oxygen, 2. 4 atmospheres absolute) before on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Age, sex, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, coronary disease severity, left ventricular function, Parsonnet score, Euroscore, bypass time, myocardial ischemia time, and number of grafts were comparable in both groups. Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina, New York Heart Association dyspnea, and previous myocardial infarction were significantly higher in group B. Inflammatory markers were analyzed before surgery and 2 and 24 hours after bypass. Neuropsychometric testing was performed 48 hours before surgery and 4 months after surgery and included trail making A and B, the Rey auditory verbal learning <b>test,</b> <b>grooved</b> peg board, information processing table A, and digit span forward and backward. Neuropsychometric dysfunction was defined as more than 1 SD deterioration in more than 2 neuropsychometric tests. Chi-square tests, Fisher tests, t tests, and analysis of variance were used as appropriate for statistical analysis. ResultsGroup A had a significant postoperative increase in the inflammatory markers soluble E-selectin, CD 18, and heat shock protein 70. This was not observed in group B. Neuropsychometric dysfunction was also significantly higher in group A compared with group B. There was no difference in any other early postoperative clinical outcome. ConclusionsOur results seem to indicate that pretreatment with hyperbaric oxygen can reduce neuropsychometric dysfunction and also modulate the inflammatory response after cardiopulmonary bypass.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the influence of cultural factors {{in the assessment of}} African Americans (N = 45) who had suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Following the administration of a neuropsychological test battery and functional outcome measures, participants completed a self-report measure of African American acculturation (African American Acculturation Scale-Short Form; Landrine 2 ̆ 6 Klonoff, 1995). In the first study, hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the possible relationship between acculturation and neuropsychological test performance. After controlling for various injury-related (TBI severity, time since injury) and demographic factors (age, sex, and education/occupation), lower levels of acculturation were associated with poorer overall neuropsychological test performance (Overall Test Battery Mean; Rohling, Langhinrichsen-Rohling, 2 ̆ 6 Miller, in press) and lower scores on three of the administered <b>tests</b> (<b>Grooved</b> Pegs, WAIS-R Block Design, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test - Categories). In the second study, standard regression analyses were performed to assess whether inclusion of cultural factors could improve the ability of neuropsychological tests to predict functional outcome following TBI. Less acculturation was related to lower ratings of functional independence on cognitive tasks (Functional Independence Measure-Cognition), greater ratings of disability (Disability Rating Scale), and decreased community integration (Community Integration Questionnaire). These findings suggest that differences in cultural experience may be an important factor in the neuropsychological assessment of African Americans following TBI, and provide support for the hypothesis that cultural factors may partially account for differences among various ethnic-cultural groups on neuropsychological tests.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discuss a}} simple, {{low-cost}} method I detecting wear progress of bearing within audio frequency signals; f < 20 kHz. The technique {{is found to}} be suitable since it is sensitive to the surface degradation prior to the onset of severe wear. The wear test is conducted under pin-on-disc configuration in a lubricated sliding condition. The results show that the value of I-kaz coefficient Z ∞ is represented by scattered data in an I-kaz 3 D spaces in which the scattered areas underwent contraction with increased sliding distance. From this statistical analysis, a clear-cut correlation with the established Taylor Tool Life Curve is noted. Here, the lower value of Z ∞ indicates severe wear which lies I the failure region of Taylor’s curve. Examination of worn microstructures is carried out using a secondary electron microscopy (SEM). Based on the morphology investigation, it is found that under lubricated <b>test,</b> parallel <b>grooves</b> and craters up to 2 µm in size are present indicating an abrasive wear mechanism has occurred.

Methods We had three groups: two clinical (eighteen subjects) and one control (twelve subjects). The learning types in these groups were assessed by two experimental tasks evaluating procedural-implicit and declarative memory. A Serial Reaction-Time Task was used to measure procedural sequence learning, and the Spanish version 1 of the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version- CVLT- 2 to measure declarative-explicit learning. The learning capacity was assessed considering only the blocks that represent learning, and were compared with MANOVA in clinical and normal subjects.

Twelve participants (average age 76 years) exercised with both hands. One of the hands exercised by pressing with the proximal phalanges (targeting mainly intrinsic hand muscles), while the other hand exercised by pressing with the finger tips (targeting mainly extrinsic hand muscles). Training led to higher MVC forces, higher enslaving indices and improved performance on the Pegboard <b>Grooved</b> <b>test.</b> Changes in an index of multi-finger force stabilizing synergy showed a significant correlation with changes in the index of force variability in the accurate force production test. Strong transfer effects were seen to the site that did not perform strength training exercise within each hand. Effects of exercise at the proximal site were somewhat stronger as compared to those of exercise at the finger tips, although the differences did not reach significance level. Control tests showed that repetitive testing by itself did not significantly change the maximal finger force and enslaving. The results suggest that strength training is {{an effective way to}} improve finger strength. It can als...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been performed {{to study the}} forced convection and pressure-drop characteristics fully-developed steady turbulent flows in air-cooled, horizontal, equilateral-triangular ducts. These ducts were constructed of duralumin, each of the same axial length and hydraulic diameter. The inner surfaces of each duct were either plane or machined with uniformly-spaced parallel, identical V-grooves. For each <b>tested</b> duct, these <b>grooves</b> had a depth of 1 mm, but were all of the same apex angle, θ, where 0 ≤ θ < 150 °. The uniform separation between the centre lines of two adjacent V-grooves was kept constant at 34 mm. The measurements were performed with the hydraulic diameter-based Reynolds number for the steady-state air flow, ranging from 2800 to 9500. The entire inner wall of the duct was heated uniformly, while its outer surface was thermally insulated. The forced convection was enhanced {{by the presence of}} the V-grooves; the greatest forced-convection augmentation being achieved with V-grooves of apex angle θ~ 17. 5 °. Non-dimensional expressions for the determination of the steady-state heat transfer coefficient and the Darcy friction-factor for the equilateral triangular ducts, which were fabricated with uniformly-spaced identical V-grooves in their inner surfaces, have been deduced.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{evidence}} on prematurity as 'a priori' a risk for palatal disturbances {{that increase the}} need for orthodontic or orthognathic treatment is still weak. Further well-designed clinical studies are needed. The objective of this review {{is to provide a}} fundamental analysis of methodologies, confounding factors, and outcomes of studies on palatal development. One focus of this review is the analysis of studies on the palate of the term newborn, since knowing what is 'normal' is a precondition of being able to assess abnormalities. Methods A search profile based on Cochrane search strategies applied to 10 medical databases was used to identify existing studies. Articles, mainly those published before 1960, were identified from hand searches in textbooks, encyclopedias, reference lists and bibliographies. Sources in English, German, and French of more than a century were included. Data for term infants were recalculated if particular information about weight, length, or maturity was given. The extracted values, especially those from non-English paper sources, were provided unfiltered for comparison. Results The search strategy yielded 182 articles, of which 155 articles remained for final analysis. Morphology of the term newborn's palate was of great interest {{in the first half of}} the last century. Two general methodologies were used to assess palatal morphology: visual and metrical descriptions. Most of the studies on term infants suffer from lack of reliability <b>tests.</b> The <b>groove</b> system was recognized as the distinctive feature of the infant palate. The shape of the palate of the term infant may vary considerably, both visually and metrically. Gender, race, mode of delivery, and nasal deformities were identified as causes contributing to altered palatal morphology. Until today, anatomical features of the newborn's palate are subject to a non-uniform nomenclature. Conclusion Today's knowledge of a newborn's 'normal' palatal morphology is based on non-standardized and limited methodologies for measuring a three-dimensional shape. This shortcoming increases bias and is the reason for contradictory research results, especially if pathologic conditions like syndromes or prematurity are involved. Adequate measurement techniques are needed and the 'normal palatal morphology' should be defined prior to new clinical studies on palatal development. </p...|$|R
40|$|Fifteen ductile {{fracture}} <b>tests</b> on <b>grooved</b> specimens are simulated to investigate {{ductile fracture}} under plane strain deformation. Stresses, especially, equivalent stresses within a critical {{distance from the}} crack tip are found to remain at constant values during steady static crack growth. The constant values of the crack tip stresses are specimen size independent. Ductile fracture criteria using stresses at the crack tip as characterization parameters are thus suggested for ductile fracture under plane strain deformation. ^ Ductile fractures of flat plates are studied by simulating fracture tests on ungrooved specimens. 3 D effects on the stress distribution at the crack tip {{must be considered in}} such cases. A 2 D moving plane strain core model is used to account for the 3 D effects. With the plane strain core model, it is found that stresses, especially, equivalent stresses at the crack tip remain constant during steady quasi-static crack growth for ungrooved specimens. Stresses at the crack tip are specimen size independent. ^ Plane strain core is proved to exist at the crack tip for an elastic plate by analytical solution of 3 D stresses at the crack tip of an elastic plate. Numerical results on the plane strain nature of the crack tip singular stresses for ductile fracture are discussed. ^ 1 T compact tension specimens of 2024 -T 3 aluminum are tested. Specimens of three different thicknesses are compared. Tunneling effects are found to be important for all cases. Equivalent crack length is introduced to account for the tunneling effects and is used together with the moving plane strain core model to simulate the experimental tests. ^ Ductile fracture criterion based on the critical equivalent stress at the crack tip is used together with plane strain strip model, a simple version of plane strain core model, to study the interaction of a leading crack and small cracks. Special attention is paid on the development of yielding zones of the interacting cracks. Swift 2 ̆ 7 s postulation that the leading crack and a small crack coalesce if the yielding zones of the two cracks overlap is shown to be good approximation at least for 2024 -T 3 aluminum. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a wear study of {{innovative}} Ti-Ta alloys is present. Samples of Ti- 30 %Ta, Ti- 52 %Ta, were produced by laser cladding. This technology uses a high power density {{generated by a}} laser beam to melt the base material and the filler material. The interaction between the laser and the substrate {{is a function of}} the radiation absorption properties of the material and that conditions the heat flow. Laser technology allows working with high temperatures and melting powders of titanium and the alloying elements as tantalum. As this is a continuous process enables rapid cooling of the molten material and the consequent solidification. The principal importance of these innovative alloys is the low Young’s Modulus, the closest to Young´s Modulus of the bone, the biocompatibility of titanium and tantalum and consequently its applicability to biomedical industry. The wear behavior is an important factor that influences the structural integrity of materials and must be studied for innovative alloys. So in this work the micro-scale abrasive wear tests were used to characterize the wear behavior of Ti- 30 %Ta, Ti- 52 %Ta alloys. The results shows that the wear volume increases linearly as the rotation of the ball test and with the sliding distance and the analysis of the ball cratering shows that for this <b>test</b> there just <b>grooving</b> abrasion and the volume wear abrasion is higher for the highest hardness alloy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive characterisation of HVOF- and HVAF-sprayed Cr 3 C 2 - 25 wt. % NiCr hardmetal coatings. One commercial powder composition with two different particle size distributions was processed using five HVOF and HVAF thermal spray systems. All coatings contain less Cr 3 C 2 than the feedstock powder, possibly {{due to the}} rebound of some Cr 3 C 2 -rich particles during high-velocity impact onto the substrate. Dry sand-rubber wheel abrasive wear <b>testing</b> causes both <b>grooving</b> and pull-out of splat fragments. Mass losses depend on inter- and intra-lamellar cohesion, being higher (≥ 70 mg after a wear distance of 5904 m) for the coatings deposited with the coarser feedstock powder or with one type of HVAF torch. Sliding wear at room temperature against alumina involves shallower abrasive grooving, small-scale delamination and carbide pull-outs, and it is controlled by intra-lamellar cohesion. The coatings obtained from the fine feedstock powder exhibit the lowest wear rates (≈ 5 × 10 - 6 mm 3 /(Nm)). At 400 °C, abrasive grooving dominates the sliding wear behaviour; wear rates increase by one order of magnitude but friction coefficients decrease from ≈ 0. 7 to ≈ 0. 5. The thermal expansion coefficient of the coatings (11. 08 × 10 - 6 °C- 1 in the 30 - 400 °C range) is sufficiently close {{to that of the}} steel substrate (14. 23 × 10 - 6 °C- 1) to avoid macro-cracking...|$|R
