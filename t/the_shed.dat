5|$|Animals {{are visible}} in stalls. Behind {{them is a}} {{crumbling}} wall with three low Romanesque windows. Four shepherds in contemporary 15th-century clothing are chatting amiably, leaning against the wall, looking into <b>the</b> <b>shed.</b> Two are positioned {{to the left and}} two to the right; in each pair one is dressed in red and an other in blue. Behind <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> is a small hill where two shepherds herd sheep along a pathway, and beyond is a Netherlandish town with two domed structures in its center, symbolizing Jerusalem and Christ's Passion. The large domed building is based on the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, a replica of which the Adornes family built in Bruges in 1427, called the Jerusalem chapel. A flock of geese is visible high in the sky through the roof's trusses.|$|E

Stepping in front of a window while holding Loomis' body, Michael is shot twice by Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Brad Dourif), and falls into the spikes of some farming equipment. Apparently released from her visions, Laurie walks over and tells Michael she loves him, then stabs him repeatedly. <b>The</b> <b>shed</b> door opens and Laurie walks out, wearing Michael's mask.

5|$|In 1897, her {{daughter}} Irène was born. To support her family, Curie began {{teaching at the}} École Normale Supérieure. The Curies {{did not have a}} dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to the School of Physics and Chemistry. <b>The</b> <b>shed,</b> formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof.

5|$|On 12 September 1965 the {{terminal}} platforms were closed. This allowed the platforms to be renumbered with the order reversed (see list below). The redundant train shed became a covered car park in February the following year, but from 1989 until 1999 the original (Brunel) part was an interactive science centre known as The Exploratory and an exhibition space. From 2002 to 2008 it housed the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum.

40|$|Key words：electrical shedding, Neural network, single neuron {{adaptive}} algorithm, PID, AC Servo-Motor, five ploynomical curve Abstract:AC Servo-Motor tracking five ploynomial curve could {{adapt the}} {{the change of}} the textile technology more better than the conjugacy cams. Whith the matlab simulation, {{the results indicate that}} single neuron adaptive algorithm is more precise than the PID algorithm and RBF neural network supervising algorithm. It has the practical meaning in improving <b>the</b> <b>shedding</b> mechanism in <b>the</b> textile machine.. THE BACKGROUND OF <b>THE</b> ARTICLE <b>The</b> <b>shedding</b> movement is achieved with conjugate cams in the traditional textile machines. With the development of the textile technology of the composite material, <b>the</b> <b>shedding</b> mechanism should change <b>the</b> <b>shedding</b> range to adapt the changes of the textile technology, and the AC servo-motor is used widely in <b>the</b> <b>shedding</b> mechanism in <b>the</b> modern textile machines such as the Toyota textile machine[1] which could adapt the changes of the textile technology. Because of the rigid or flexible impact induced by initialing angular acceleration, the machine is vibrated fiercely, but the five polynomial curve motion[2] has less impact based on the textile technology. <b>The</b> <b>shedding</b> mechanism especially <b>the</b> high-quality composite material need the less impact and <b>the</b> precise <b>shedding</b> range. <b>The</b> traditional motor controlling algorithm is PID, to improve the controlling precision of <b>the</b> <b>shedding</b> motion, <b>the</b> author advance the single neural adaptive algorithm based on <b>the</b> <b>shedding</b> motor. <b>The</b> comparison of PID, single neuron adaptive algorithm, RBF neural network supervising algorithm results that the motor with single neuron adaptive algorithm could work the five polynomial curve motion more precisely than others.

The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats {{to an emergency}} bunker, while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When Arnold fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to <b>the</b> <b>shed.</b> They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the raptors. Muldoon distracts the raptors, while Sattler goes to turn the power back on, before being attacked by a raptor and discovering Arnold's severed arm. Meanwhile, Muldoon is caught off-guard and killed by the other two raptors.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, {{three years}} after the first Quaker {{settlers}} arrived in the area, a meeting house was constructed {{on the site of the}} present-day Friends meeting house for US$1,000. Quakers continued to flow into the area through the 1860s and in 1874 the current Friends meeting house was constructed and it has seen little change since it was built. Some minor alterations have taken place, including the addition of a concrete porch to the entryway and a shed on the east (rear) facade. <b>The</b> <b>shed</b> was added around 1910 to serve as a storage space and a privy. The building became a social, political, and religious hub for the area Quakers and the site was visited by Friends from other meeting houses around the state. The building is no longer owned by a religious institution, though there are occasional services held there.|$|E
5|$|In November 1955, a {{grand jury}} {{declined}} to indict Bryant and Milam for kidnapping, despite their own admissions of having taken Till. Mose Wright and {{a young man named}} Willie Reed, who testified to seeing Milam enter <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> from which screams and blows were heard, both testified in front of the grand jury. After the trial, T.R.M.Howard paid the costs of relocating to Chicago for Wright, Reed, and another black witness who testified against Milam and Bryant, {{in order to protect the}} three witnesses from reprisals for having testified. Reed, who later changed his name to Willie Louis to avoid being found, continued to live in the Chicago area until his death on July 18, 2013. He avoided publicity and even kept his history secret from his wife until she was told by a relative. Reed began to speak publicly about the case in the PBS documentary The Murder of Emmett Till aired in 2003.|$|E

In Saint Andrew Parish's Sandy Park, a house next to a street gully succumbed {{to the effects of}} the storm; five bodies were recovered near the site, while the final missing inhabitant was presumed dead. Elsewhere in Saint Andrew, three construction workers were killed when <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> in which they were sleeping caved in. A girl was crushed to death under the weight of a collapsed board house in Saint Catherine Parish. Rushing waters swept away three people {{in different parts of the}} island, all of whom drowned. Amid a microburst, a waterspout tore roofs off buildings and hospitalized five residents in Westmoreland Parish's capital of Savanna-la-Mar, while to the northwest, strong gusts and rough surf impacted the resort town of Negril. In the wake of the storm, a body was recovered from debris along a road in Saint Catherine. Flooded streets, roads and bridges isolated communities across seven of the island's parishes and trapped hundreds of residents in their homes.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} eight tracks and four island platforms. According to the New York City Transit Authority, {{this makes it}} one of the world's largest {{elevated}} transportation terminals, as well as the largest in North America. The westernmost tracks, tracks 5–8, gradually slope downward, so tracks 1–4 are slightly higher than tracks 5–8 at the station's south end. There are ADA-compliant ramps from the three easternmost platforms (the Culver, Brighton, and Sea Beach Lines' platforms, respectively) to the main station building below the platforms; a non-ADA-compliant ramp leads from the West End Line (eastern) platform, with steps. An ADA-compliant elevator at the northern end of the West End Line platform leads to an overpass that connects to another ADA-compliant elevator at the northern end of the Sea Beach Line's platform. There are also stairways down to the station building. The southern two-thirds of the station is under the solar-panel-covered roof, while the northern third of the station is in the open air, not covered by anything. <b>The</b> <b>shed</b> is lit up by platform floodlights during the night hours.|$|E
5|$|After Watkin's {{retirement}} from management, {{relations between the}} MR and GCR deteriorated rapidly over shared use of Baker Street station and the congested route into London, and soon broke down completely. On 30 July 1898 John Bell, General Manager of the Metropolitan Railway, {{took control of the}} Quainton Road signal box himself and refused to allow a GCR train onto MR-owned tracks {{on the grounds that it}} was scheduled to take the Great Western rather than the Metropolitan route south of Aylesbury, while on one occasion in 1901 King Edward VII was travelling home after visiting a friend in Wendover; the MR signalman allowed a slow goods train to run in front of the royal train, causing the King to arrive late back in London. The MR management also refused the GCR permission to install points to connect their engine shed at Aylesbury to the railway line, on the grounds that the land for <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> had been bought clandestinely. Eventually a parallel set of tracks was built for the GCR between Harrow and London, running alongside the MR to a separate terminus at Marylebone, a short distance from Baker Street. The GCR continued to share the less-congested section between Quainton Road and Harrow—including Chalfont Road station—with the MR.|$|E

5|$|After {{shooting}} Magruder {{and killing}} Arnaud, Logan then fled {{the scene with}} Kromah in a silver-painted Dodge Charger with Maryland license plates, with Kromah driving the vehicle. After leaving the house, Kromah took the weapon from Logan and attempted to wipe off any residual evidence, such as fingerprints, from it. The two then disposed of the murder weapon by burying it at a nearby forested cemetery and abandoned the getaway vehicle. Kromah was captured and charged as an accomplice to the murder; he pleaded guilty on April 24, 2003 to being an accessory after the fact to a murder. In the meantime, Logan stayed briefly at the residence of Twyla James, a woman who lived in Largo, Maryland. James would later be arrested and charged as an accessory to murder as she transported Logan, whom she had known was a murder suspect and fugitive sought by legal authorities, to her residence and allowed him to stay there. Logan was apprehended {{two days after the}} murder, on August 31, 2002, at a shed near the Quebec Arms Apartments in Hyattsville, Maryland, on the 8200 block of 14th Avenue. He was spotted there by undercover policemen, who had received information that it had been an area that Logan was known to frequent in the past. Logan was found hiding in <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> by policemen, who then used a police canine and a taser to subdue and apprehend him.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Nevinson joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit, which his father had helped to found. From 13 November 1914, Nevinson spent nine weeks in France with the FAU and the British Red Cross Society, mostly working at a disused goods shed by Dunkirk rail station known as the Shambles. The Shambles housed some three thousand badly wounded French troops, who had been evacuated from the Front and then all but abandoned. For weeks they had been left unfed and untended with the dead and dying lying together on dirty straw. Nevinson, alongside his father and other volunteers, worked to dress wounds, help clean and disinfect <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> and started to make it habitable. Nevinson later depicted his experiences in The Shambles in two paintings, The Doctor and La Patrie. As the French authorities began {{to take control of}} the situation, Nevinson was reassigned as an ambulance driver. Although Nevinson would often make much of this time as an ambulance driver, particularly in his publicity material, he only held the role for a week as, due to his poor health, he lacked the strength to steer the vehicle. By January 1915 his worsening rheumatism had made him unfit for further service and he returned to Britain.|$|E

A lock of Maria's hair sold for two guineas. Polstead became a tourist venue with visitors travelling from as far afield as Ireland; Curtis estimated that 200,000 people visited Polstead in 1828 alone. The Red Barn and the Martens' cottage excited particular interest. The barn was stripped for souvenirs, down to the planks being removed from the sides, broken up, and sold as toothpicks. It was slated to be demolished after the trial, but it was left standing and eventually burned down in 1842. Even Maria's gravestone in the churchyard of St Mary's, Polstead was eventually chipped away to nothing by souvenir hunters; only a sign on <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> now marks the approximate place where it stood, although her name is given to Marten's Lane in the village. Pottery models and sketches were sold and songs were composed, including one quoted in the Vaughan Williams opera Hugh the Drover and Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus.|$|E
