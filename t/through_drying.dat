5000|$|Lumber's nominal {{dimensions}} {{are larger than}} the actual standard dimensions of finished lumber.

Complete pressure drop-drying rate curves are determined for 235 handsheets of kraft paper of basis weights 25 - 150 g/m$ sp{ rm 2 }$ dried in air {{over a wide}} range of temperatures and throughflow rates. The previous procedure of calculating permeability by Darcy's law is substantially in error at relevant throughflow rates. A new characteristic dimension for flow through both dry and moist paper is determined by application of fundamental momentum transport principles. During <b>through</b> <b>drying</b> the value of the d$ sb{ rm p}$ drops substantially from an upper to a lower asymptotic limit, shown to correspond to known water-fibre relations. A theoretically based Re-f-d$ sb{ rm p}$ treatment is shown to be a more powerful method than those used previously. A comprehensive, tested correlation for <b>through</b> <b>drying</b> rates in the constant rate period is reported. <b>Through</b> <b>drying</b> is demonstrated to start with an increasing rate period during which, for industrial conditions, about half the water is removed. An original treatment, "drying period diagrams", shows the extent of the increasing, constant and falling rate periods as a function of drying conditions.

40|$|<b>Through</b> <b>drying</b> {{of paper}} of basis weight 25 to 50 g/m 2 was studied through 89 {{experiments}} with 22 to 90 °C air at mass flow rates from 0. 125 to 1. 45 kg/m 2 s. The complete drying rate curves are represented with five quantitative parameters: moisture contents {{at the end}} of the increasing and constant rate periods, the constant drying rate, and exponents for the increasing and falling rate period relations. The constant drying rate period disappears at higher drying intensities leaving the increasing rate period accounting for as much as 37 % of the drying. The constant drying rate may be controlled by thermodynamics or by transport phenomena. The critical moisture content depends on effects from the intrinsic local nonuniformity of <b>through</b> <b>drying</b> as well as on sheet average conditions. A universal set of relations was obtained for representation of the complete drying rate curve and was verified for prediction of drying rate and drying time. <b>Through</b> <b>drying</b> rates cannot be increased significantly by providing the drying air as an impingement flow...|$|E

A drying rate - moisture content relationship for this period was obtained based on theoretical analysis. It was verified with experimental data. A quantitative representation of the complete drying rate curve was established using this relationship and a modified power law equation for the falling rate period drying rate - moisture content relation. It needs five parameters to quantify the <b>through</b> <b>drying</b> from wet to dry: moisture content {{at the end of the}} increasing rate period; exponent for the drying rate - moisture relationship during the increasing rate period; constant drying rate; critical moisture content and the power-law exponent for the falling rate period...|$|E

40|$|Air drying {{of paper}} by pure impingement, pure through flow and by {{combination}} of impingement and through flow was studied. For the combined process the inlet and both outlet air flow rates were held constant throughout drying, thereby providing results appropriate {{for analysis of}} the complex and interacting kinetics. Pure impingement drying rate curves were quantified with three parameters which were related to drying process conditions: constant drying rate, critical moisture content and the exponent for a power law relationship over the falling rate period. The Churchill - Usagi asymptotic approach model was tested and found not applicable. For pure <b>through</b> <b>drying</b> the constant drying rate period disappears at higher drying intensities leaving two drying rate periods, the increasing rate and falling rate periods. A theoretically based exponential relationship was obtained for the increasing rate period, where up to 47 % of the drying may occur. Drying rate curves were quantified with no subjective judgements, using five parameters: moisture contents {{at the end of}} the increasing rate and constant rate periods, constant drying rate, and exponents for the increasing and falling rate period relations. A universal normalized drying rate curve was obtained. <b>Through</b> <b>drying</b> rates are the same with or without impinging jets. In combined impingement and through air drying, an adiabatic process, removal of impingement boundary layer humidity by through flow makes both components of the process nonadiabatic. Relative to pure impingement drying, impingement water removal rates are sensitively reduced by through flow. Because critical moisture content is intrinsically lower for <b>through</b> <b>drying</b> than impingement drying, through flow water removal rate curves can be strikingly different from pure <b>through</b> <b>drying,</b> with addition of a unique feature, a secondary increasing rate period when paper temperature is driven up by the falling rate period of impingement water removal. Parameters for quantitative representation were determined, analyzed and related to drying process conditions. Of two prior models for the combined impingement and through air drying of paper, trends assumed by Randall (1984) are now found contrary to actual rates while the Crotogino and Allenger (1979) model has the trends correct but over predicts the drying rates now measured. Results of the pilot plant work of Burgess et al. (1972) are consistent with the comprehensive model now developed to predict drying time and drying rate for combined impingement and through flow air drying of paper...|$|E
40|$|A general {{model for}} <b>through</b> <b>drying</b> of tissue was {{developed}} {{based on the}} equations of continuity in combination with correlations for heat and mass transfer. The model incorporates different geometric descriptions together with corresponding heat and mass transfer correlations for flow through cylindrical conduits and flow through packed beds of cylindrical fibers. At low intensities, i. e., at low airflow rates and low drying air temperatures, the model shows very good agreement with experimental data {{found in the literature}} and accurately predicts a period of constant drying rate due to saturation of the drying air. However, at higher drying intensities, the model predicts drying rates that are generally higher than what is found in experimental studies described in the literature. The model also predicts a period of constant drying rate that has not been observed in experiments at higher drying intensities. To illustrate the effect of nonuniform pore size distribution on the average drying rate, a model including a variable pore size distribution was developed. The results show that the early onset of the falling rate period in <b>through</b> <b>drying</b> at higher intensities could be explained by channelling effects caused by a nonuniform pore size distribution...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{facility was}} developed to determine fundamental characteristics of combined impingement and through air drying of paper. Removal of impingement boundary layer humidity by through flow makes both components of the combined process nonadiabatic, complicating the analysis.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model for <b>through</b> <b>drying</b> of paper at constant pressure drop was developed. The model {{is based on}} physical properties; hence, basis weight, pressure drop, drying air temperature, pore size distribution, initial gas fraction, and tortuosity are important input parameters to the model. The model was solved for different combinations of the variables basis weight, drying air temperature, and pressure drop corresponding to industrial conditions {{and the results were}} compared with data from bench-scale experiments. The simulations show that the drying rate curve is very sensitive to the air flow rate and that correctly modeling the correlation between pressure drop and air flow rate is the most important factor for a successful model for <b>through</b> <b>drying.</b> The model was tuned by adjusting the parameters initial gas fraction and tortuosity in order to give the best possible fit to experimental data. For a given basis weight and pressure drop, different drying air temperatures resulted in relatively constant values of the fitted parameters. This means that the model can well predict the effects of changes in drying air temperature based on a tuning of the model performed at the same basis weight and pressure drop. However, for a given basis weight, an increase in pressure drop yielded fitted parameters that were somewhat different; i. e., a lower initial gas fraction and a higher tortuosity, a change that increases the resistance to air flow. This implies that the correlation between pressure drop and air flow rate in the model does not quite capture the nonlinear relationship shown by the experiments...|$|E
