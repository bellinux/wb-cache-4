5|$|In the {{following}} season, the Lakers won 26 {{of their first}} 39 games, but lost 27 of their last 43—including seven in a row at one point—to finish 42–40. They were eliminated {{in the first round}} by Phoenix again. Frustrated by the team's inability to advance in the playoffs, Bryant demanded to be traded in the offseason. Buss initially agreed to seek a trade, but also worked to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> Bryant's mind.|$|E
5|$|Most of Æthelred's time as {{archbishop}} {{was spent}} {{dealing with the}} effects of Viking raids, but he also had a conflict with King Alfred the Great over royal control of ecclesiastical affairs. It was during Æthelred's archbishopric that the Golden Gospels, a still-surviving 8th century gospel book, was ransomed from a raiding army and donated to Canterbury. Pope John VIII also urged Æthelred and Archbishop Wulfhere of York to reform the dress of the English clergy. The Anglo-Saxon clergy wore the short tunic that was the normal costume of the laypeople of Britain. The Roman custom, however, was to wear long clerical robes or habits, and the Anglo-Saxon custom was opposed by the papacy and other continental clergy. Whether Æthelred and Wulfred took steps to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the dress of their clergy is unknown, but the clothing customs of the Anglo-Saxon clergy did not change.|$|E

5|$|The unmarked {{bills from}} the robbery {{were easy to}} exchange, but the serial numbers of the 500-ruble notes were known to the authorities, making them {{impossible}} to exchange in Russian banks. By the end of 1907, Lenin decided to exchange the remaining 500-ruble notes abroad. Krasin had his forger <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> some of the serial numbers. Two hundred of these notes were transported abroad by Martyn Lyadov (they were sewn into his vest by the wives of Lenin and Bogdanov at Lenin's headquarters in Kuokkala). Lenin's plan was to have various individuals exchange the stolen 500-ruble notes simultaneously {{at a number of}} banks throughout Europe. Zhitomirsky heard of the plan and reported it to the Okhrana, who contacted police departments throughout Europe asking them to arrest anyone who tried to cash the notes.|$|E
5|$|Though these {{measures}} were established to counter {{many of the}} irrationalities in the Soviet economic system, the reform did not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the existing system radically; it instead tried to improve it gradually. Success was ultimately mixed, and Soviet analyses on why the reform failed to reach its full potential have never given any definitive answers. The key factors are agreed upon, however, with blame being put on {{the combination of the}} recentralisation of the economy with the decentralisation of enterprise autonomy, creating several administrative obstacles. Additionally, instead of creating a market which in turn would establish a pricing system, administrators were given the responsibility for overhauling the pricing system themselves. Because of this, the market-like system failed to materialise. To make matters worse, the reform was contradictory at best. In retrospect, however, the Eighth Five-Year Plan as a whole is considered {{to be one of the}} most successful periods for the Soviet economy, and the most successful for consumer production.|$|E

25|$|Some materialists among modern {{historians have}} tried to read a form of class {{struggle}} into Sverre and the Birkebeiner's fight against Erling and Magnus. However, {{the extent to which}} Sverre's men actually represented the impoverished strata of the population remains disputed. It is clear that most of the lendmenn—the nobility of the time—sided with King Magnus, but Sverre also quickly won several of them over to his side. In any event, the Birkebeiner did not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the social order of society; they merely wanted to place themselves at its top.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} police {{was involved in}} various ways in Operation Peace for Galilee, although the bulk of its duties were according to standard procedure. The corps had ample {{time to prepare for}} the operation and very specific designations were made for it {{as a result of the}} lessons learned from the Yom Kippur War (see also: Sectors and operations during emergency). For the first time, it met a friendly population in Lebanon, which often cooperated with the IDF - this created a need for MP presence to prevent the soldiers from making illegal dealings with the locals. Placing road signs was also a major issue, as for the first time a major city (Beirut) needed to be labeled, and enemy forces would certainly <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the signs to mislead the IDF. To counter this, Graffiti was used on the city buildings to indicate direction.|$|E

500|$|The {{indigenous}} people lived on their traditional lands until the 1950s, when settlers began encroaching. Gagnon {{found them to}} be [...] "free from pretension, ostentation or calculation. Obviously, these uncommon virtues in a modern society make them victim to many abuses." [...] Partly due to his efforts, the Cutivireni land was protected from settlement by others; it was the only land of the Asháninka people to be preserved. Although taught modern technology and facilitated Spanish lessons with the Summer Linguistics Institute, a Protestant organization, for the {{indigenous people}}, he did not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> aspects of their culture, like polygamy or women going topless.|$|E

Before he dies, the soldier informs Kratos that Zeus has destroyed Sparta in Kratos' absence. Outraged, Kratos is further motivated and frees a phoenix, riding the creature to the Sisters' stronghold where he confronts two, Lakhesis and Atropos. After they refuse his request to alter time, Kratos battles them. During this, the Sisters <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the outcome of Kratos' battle with Ares, but Kratos kills them both, then confronts the remaining Sister, Clotho. He kills her using her own traps, and acquires the [...] "Loom of Fate" [...] in order to return to the point at which Zeus betrayed him.|$|E

[...] Despite this media and public relations training, industry sources stated, [...] "They gave him talking points and he just didn't execute". [...] The same sources also noted that, while [...] "Parker seemed at times to understand the need to emphasize his sorrow about the devastating impact of the 1999 encounter on {{the woman at the}} center of the charges, sources say when the cameras rolled he reverted to his original position." [...] In an October 2016 60 Minutes interview, Parker maintained that he was innocent of the crime and that he did not feel guilty about it, but conceded that, from the perspective of a 36-year-old man, he had done something morally wrong.|$|E

500|$|Sinatra's {{decline in}} {{popularity}} was evident at his concert appearances. At a brief {{run at the}} Paramount in New York he drew small audiences. At the Desert Inn in Las Vegas he performed to half-filled houses of wildcatters and ranchers. At a concert at Chez Paree in Chicago, only 150 people in a 1,200-seat capacity venue turned up to see him. By April 1952 he was performing at the Kauai County Fair in Hawaii. Sinatra's relationship with Columbia Records was also disintegrating, with A executive Mitch Miller claiming he [...] "couldn't give away" [...] the singer's records. Though several notable recordings were made during this time period, such as [...] "If I Could Write a Book" [...] in January 1952, which Granata sees as a [...] "turning point", forecasting his later work with its sensitivity, Columbia and MCA dropped him later that year. His last studio recording for Columbia, [...] "Why <b>Try</b> <b>To</b> <b>Change</b> Me Now", was recorded in New York on September 17, 1952, with orchestra arranged and conducted by Percy Faith. [...] Journalist Burt Boyar observed, [...] "Sinatra had had it. It was sad. From the top to the bottom in one horrible lesson." ...|$|E
