2500|$|The modern [...] "high tension" [...] snare was {{developed}} {{in response to the}} higher head tensions made possible with the development of Kevlar and other high strength fibers bonded into the drum head. These high <b>tension</b> <b>drums</b> were first developed by Legato of Australia [...] for pipe band snare <b>drums.</b> High <b>tension</b> <b>drums</b> began and were perfected in the pipe band market and later moved into the marching band and drum corps areas. The bottom (or resonant) side of the drum has a tightly tuned head and synthetic gut or metal snare wires, which are often secured to the drum using a strainer to limit their movement and make the sound more staccato. For outdoor use, a projector or [...] "scoop" [...] - a piece of curved plastic - may be attached {{to the back of the}} bottom hoop to help project the sound forward to the audience.|$|R
25|$|Top, or first, bass is {{the highest}} pitched drum in the bass line and usually starts or ends phrases. The high <b>tension</b> <b>drum</b> heads allow this player to play notes that are just as taxing {{as those of the}} snare line, and often the top bass will play a part in unison with the snare line to add some depth to their sound.|$|R
50|$|The {{music of}} the Yoruba people is {{perhaps best known for}} an {{extremely}} advanced drumming tradition, especially using the dundun hourglass <b>tension</b> <b>drums.</b> The representation of musical instruments on sculptural works from Ile-Ife, indicates, in general terms a substantial accord with oral traditions. A lot of these musical instruments date back to the classical period of Ile-Ife, which began at around the 10th century A.D. Some were already present prior to this period, while others were created later. The hourglass <b>tension</b> <b>drum</b> (Dùndún) for example, may have been introduced around the 15th century (1400's), the Benin bronze plaques of the middle period depicts them. Others like the double and single iron clapper-less bells are examples of instruments that preceded classical Ife. Yoruba folk music became perhaps the most prominent kind of West African music in Afro-Latin and Caribbean musical styles. Yorùbá music left an especially important influence on the music of Trinidad, the Lukumi religious traditions, practice and the music of Cuba.|$|R
50|$|In Africa, cord-and-peg tension atabaques had a {{distribution}} area roughly {{congruent with the}} iron double bell (Agogo). This included the Guinea Coast from the Niger River and west to Benin, Togo, and Ghana. Beyond West Africa, cord-and-peg <b>tension</b> <b>drums</b> appeared in Bahia, Suriname, St. Domingue, Cuba, and the southern states of America. These drums traveled with the Ewe, Fon, Akan, and Yoruba people during the New World diaspora.|$|R

40|$|The main {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} the sis was to propose a horizontal belt conveyor with a transport output 80 tonnes per hour. The transported material is sand and gravel. Functional calculation is carried out ČSN ISO 5048 which specifies main dimensions and proposal of propulsion. The shaft of <b>tension</b> <b>drum</b> is object of the strenght calculations. The conveyor is easily transportable and demountable. That means, it is also acceptable for middle and smaller functioning. Individual components of conveyor are chosen from catalogues of contemporary companies...|$|R

5000|$|Yoruba {{music is}} {{prominent}} in the music of Nigeria and in Afro-Latin and Caribbean musical styles. Ensembles using the talking drum play a type of music that is called dundun after the drum, using various sizes of <b>tension</b> <b>drum</b> along with special band drums (ogido). The leader or oniyalu uses the drum to [...] "talk" [...] by imitating the tonality of Yoruba language. Yoruba music traditionally centred on folklore and spiritual/deity worship, utilising basic and natural instruments such as handclaps. Professional musicians were referred to by the derogatory term of Alagbe.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album is}} the first the band self-produced, with {{additional}} assistance provided by Crowded House-producer Mitchell Froom on two tracks, [...] "Silently" [...] and [...] "Top Ranking". In a press release accompanying the album, the band members acknowledged their goals to be more spontaneous in their song-writing, to aim for simplicity and clarity, and to create additional <b>tensions.</b> <b>Drummer</b> Simone Pace said he found it nerve-wracking to enter the studio with only loose ideas for songs. Singer Kazu Makino admitted it [...] "wasn't an entirely enjoyable experience. Without a producer, a referee, we could really get on each other's cases. It got intense." ...|$|R
2500|$|On modern {{band and}} orchestral drums, the drumhead is {{placed over the}} opening of the drum, which in turn is held onto the shell by a [...] "counterhoop" [...] (or [...] "rim"), which is then held by means of a number of tuning screws called [...] "tension rods" [...] that screw into lugs placed evenly around the circumference. The head's tension can be {{adjusted}} by loosening or tightening the rods. Many such drums have six to ten tension rods. The sound of a drum depends on many variables—including shape, shell size and thickness, shell materials, counterhoop material, drumhead material, drumhead <b>tension,</b> <b>drum</b> position, location, and striking velocity and angle.|$|R
5000|$|Double-tension is {{a method}} of {{applying}} <b>tension</b> to <b>drum</b> heads. Drum manufacturers use several methods to apply <b>tension</b> to <b>drum</b> heads; the preferred way is to tighten the heads with a hoop that is held tight to the drum shell {{with a number of}} individual threaded rods which connect to stanchions mounted with bolts onto the outside of the drum shell. When there are individual stanchions for both the lower head and the upper [...] "struck" [...] head, or when there is one common center-mounted stanchion that accepts the threaded rods from both the upper and lower drum heads, that {{is said to be a}} double-tension drum.|$|R

50|$|Guitarist Jerry Teel and bassist Lisa Wells founded The Honeymoon Killers in {{the summer}} of 1983. They were later {{accompanied}} by guitarist Michael O'Neill and former Ritual <b>Tension</b> <b>drummer</b> Claire Lawrence-Slater on their 1984 debut album The Honeymoon Killers from Mars, released on the band's own label Fur Records. Drummer Sally Edroso, who became the band's most consistent drummer, joined the band for the release of Love American Style in 1985. Continuing as a trio the band released 1986's Let It Breed, which was recorded with Steve McAllister and composer/producer Mark Kramer. The following year Cristina Martinez, of Pussy Galore and Boss Hog, joined the band as a second guitarist for band's fourth album Turn Me On. The EPs Take It Off! and 'Til Death Do Us Part followed in 1988 and 1990 respectively. 1991's Hung Far Low, the band's first studio album in four years, was recorded with drummer Russell Simins and guitarist Jon Spencer.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} estimating and controlling {{the speed of a}} belt-driven casting drum in a web production process, where direct measurement of drum speed is infeasible. Techniques for estimating web <b>tension</b> and casting <b>drum</b> speed, using measured values of brake and drive torque demand and speed, are described and veried by application to a laboratory casting drum facility. The estimates of web <b>tension</b> and casting <b>drum</b> speed are incorporated in a new speed control strategy, which counteracts the effects of creep and slip between the drive belt and pulleys. Experimental results demonstrate much improved steady-state speed holding and transient speed response of the casting drum, in comparison with the performance of the original controller: the steady-state speed error with nominal (50 per cent) web tension is reduced from 0. 8 to 0. 1 per cent, while the peak transient speed error for a 25 per cent change in web tension reduces from 4 to 0. 5 per cent...|$|R
50|$|The drum {{corps of}} a pipe band {{consists}} of a section of drummers playing highland snare drums and the bass section (see below). In {{the early days of}} pipe bands, rope <b>tension</b> snare <b>drums</b> were common, but as the technology evolved, so did the music. Pipe band drummers now play on drums with very tight, knitted kevlar heads, designed for maximum tension to create a very crisp and strident sound. Due to technological innovations and changing aesthetics, this crispness has {{become an integral part of}} the pipe band sound. Since today's drum is so facile as a result of its design, players are often able to execute extremely complicated and technically demanding rudimentary patterns.|$|R
50|$|Rope-tension is {{the oldest}} system for {{applying}} <b>tension</b> to <b>drum</b> heads and was common until the late 19th Century.A long rope (or less commonly, a series of ropes) is passed alternately between {{the top and bottom}} drum head hoops that are held to the shell by clamps which incorporate holes for the rope(s). The ropes are tightened by sewn-together loops, usually of leather, which are slid downward to tighten the drum heads and which remain in position by surface tension against the rope.The drum heads thus tightened are not as tense as with the more modern single-tension or double-tension systems, but offer a historically deep tone in keeping with the heritage of certain music, such as pipe-and-drum corps, fife-and-drum corps, or bands of the Civil War era.|$|R
50|$|In September 2008 {{the band}} pounded out another album, {{entitled}} Phantom Cats. Around this time, The Quakes, an American Psychobilly band based in Phoenix, recruited Juan Carlos to play drums for them. This position would influence Juan's playing style from a standard sit-down drumkit, to {{working as an}} upright <b>drummer.</b> <b>Tensions</b> came to a boiling point within The Limit Club and Cadaverous Joel was asked to leave. Nicholas David (NickDave) was then recruited to fill the position of bassist.|$|R
50|$|When {{tensioning}} a head, the tensioning rod {{closest to}} the tensioner should be tightened first. The {{reason for this is}} to keep an even <b>tension</b> across the <b>drum</b> head, which is impossible to do if the lugs are tightened differently. Next, the tension rod opposite the first lug is tightened by the same number of turns. The process is repeated for the remaining lugs in order, moving {{from one side of the}} head to the other.|$|R
