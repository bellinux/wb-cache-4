5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Morsell with it.|$|E

On April 26, Sultana stopped at Helena, Arkansas, where photographer T.W. Bankes <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the grossly overcrowded vessel. Near 7:00 P.M., Sultana reached Memphis, Tennessee, and the crew began unloading 120 tons of sugar from the hold.
