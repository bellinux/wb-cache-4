However, special relativity does not apply beyond motion <b>through</b> <b>space.</b> Hubble's law describes velocity that results from expansion of space, rather than <b>through</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

5|$|Aether is a {{video game}} {{designed}} by Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel and published by Armor Games, released on September 3, 2008. Players control a lonely boy and an octopus-like monster that the boy encounters, solving puzzles on different planets to restore them from monochrome to color. The pair travel <b>through</b> <b>space</b> by swinging on clouds and asteroids with the monster's elongated tongue, searching other planets for life to which the boy can relate. It is {{also a part of}} The Basement Collection.|$|E
5|$|As the {{universe}} cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate {{that of the}} photon radiation. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued <b>through</b> <b>space</b> largely unimpeded. This relic radiation {{is known as the}} cosmic microwave background radiation. The chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when {{the universe}} was only 10–17 million years old.|$|E

5|$|Creatively, {{the focus}} of Watchmen is on its structure. Gibbons used a nine-panel grid layout {{throughout}} the series and added recurring symbols such as a blood-stained smiley face. All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series' backstory, and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story, an in-story pirate comic titled Tales of the Black Freighter, {{which one of the}} characters reads. Structured, at times, as a nonlinear narrative, the story skips <b>through</b> <b>space,</b> time and plot. In the same manner, entire scenes and dialogue have parallels with others through synchronicity, coincidence and repeated imagery.|$|E
5|$|Further {{tests of}} general {{relativity}} include precision measurements of the Shapiro effect or gravitational time delay for light, most recently in 2002 by the Cassini space probe. One set of tests focuses on effects predicted by general relativity for the behavior of gyroscopes travelling <b>through</b> <b>space.</b> One of these effects, geodetic precession, has been tested with the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment (high-precision measurements of the orbit of the Moon). Another, which is related to rotating masses, is called frame-dragging. The geodetic and frame-dragging effects were both tested by the Gravity Probe B satellite experiment launched in 2004, with results confirming relativity to within 0.5% and 15%, respectively, as of December 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 2273, a Starfleet {{monitoring}} station, Epsilon Nine, detects {{an alien}} force, {{hidden in a}} massive cloud of energy, moving <b>through</b> <b>space</b> towards Earth. The cloud destroys three of the Klingon Empire's new K't'inga-class warships and the monitoring station en route. On Earth, the starship Enterprise is undergoing a major refit; her former commanding officer, James T. Kirk, has been promoted to Admiral and works in San Francisco as Chief of Starfleet Operations. Starfleet dispatches Enterprise to investigate the cloud entity as the ship {{is the only one}} in intercept range, requiring her new systems to be tested in transit.|$|E

5|$|In September 2001 {{development}} {{began on}} a new project, Sam & Max Plunge <b>Through</b> <b>Space.</b> The game was to be an Xbox exclusive title, developed by Infinite Machine, a small company consisting {{of a number of}} former LucasArts employees. The story of the game was developed by Purcell and fellow designer Chuck Jordan and involved the Freelance Police travelling the galaxy to find a stolen Statue of Liberty. However, Infinite Machine went bankrupt within a year, partially due to the failure of their first game, New Legends, and the project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In {{models of}} the {{expanding}} universe, the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. This receding is not due to motion <b>through</b> <b>space,</b> but rather {{to the expansion of}} space itself. For example, galaxies far away from Earth appear to be moving away from the Earth with a speed proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called the Hubble sphere, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes greater than the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is a {{theoretical}} framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings look like small segments or loops of ordinary string. String theory describes how strings propagate <b>through</b> <b>space</b> and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.|$|E
