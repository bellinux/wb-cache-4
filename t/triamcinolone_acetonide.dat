25|$|In September 2016, Russian hackers hacked the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) ADAMS {{anti-doping}} {{system and}} released {{data on a}} number of athletes, including Chris Froome and Bradley Wiggins. Therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) are medical exemptions athletes can be given when they need treatment for pre-existing medical conditions where the drugs used in the treatment are on the WADA prohibited compound list. The leak demonstrated that Wiggins had received TUEs for <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>acetonide</b> in June 2011, June 2012 and April 2013, a number of days {{before the start of the}} 2011 Tour de France, 2012 Tour de France, and 2013 Giro d'Italia respectively. Wiggins also received TUEs for salbutamol, fluticasone, formoterol and budesonide whilst at Team Highroad. Froome had received TUEs for prednisolone in May 2013 and during the 2014 Tour de Romandie.|$|E
500|$|In a 2004 article {{published}} in Dermatology Online Journal, authors reported on use of the Magic Wand to help alleviate pain before cosmetic and dermatologic techniques performed by clinicians. The authors described use of the device to decrease discomfort before procedures including supplementing anesthesia with the injection of <b>triamcinolone</b> <b>acetonide</b> into the proximal nail fold for psoriasis, decreasing discomfort during a Restylane injection of the nasolabial fold, making an intense pulsed light (IPL) facial treatment easier by reducing pain during the procedure, and throughout axillary hyperhidrosis treatment with botulinum toxin. They recommended use of the device with the [...] "Wonder Wand" [...] attachment to provide vibration to a decreased surface area on the patient. Lead researcher Kevin C. Smith explained to Skin & Allergy News that the vibrations when delivered {{to the area of}} the patient's mandible can give relief from discomfort by negating feelings of pain from being sent through the sensory system. Smith and Francisco Perez-Atamoros further elaborated on use of the Magic Wand in Chapter 7 [...] "Other Dermatologic Uses of Botulinum Toxin" [...] of the 2006 compilation book Botulinum Toxin in Clinical Dermatology. They emphasized the beneficial uses of the Magic Wand with the [...] "Wonder Wand" [...] attachment and showed how its vibrations can reduce pain if given just before an injection of Restylane within [...] from the injection site.|$|E
