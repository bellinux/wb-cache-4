It was generally felt that the sun was bursting through the clouds and that Fate would soon despair of the hopeless task of trying to keep good men down.|$|E
6000|$|Monseigneur, my dear, {{is really}} one of the finest young fellows it is {{possible}} to see. A tall, broad-chested, slim-waisted, brown-faced, dark-eyed young prince, with a great beard (and other martial qualities no doubt) beyond his years. As he strode into the Chapel of the Invalides on <b>Tuesday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head of his men, he made no small impression, I can tell you, upon the ladies assembled to witness the ceremony. Nor are the crew of the [...] "Belle Poule" [...] less agreeable to look at than their commander. A more clean, smart, active, well-limbed set of lads never [...] "did dance" [...] upon the deck of the famed [...] "Belle Poule" [...] in the days of her memorable combat with the [...] "Saucy Arethusa." [...] "These five hundred sailors," [...] says a French newspaper, speaking of them in the proper French way, [...] "sword in hand, in the severe costume of board-ship (la severe tenue du bord), seemed proud of the mission that they had just accomplished. Their blue jackets, their red cravats, the turned-down collars of blue shirts edged with white, ABOVE ALL their resolute appearance and martial air, gave a favorable specimen of the present state of our marine--a marine of which so much might be expected and from which so little has been required."--Le Commerce: 16th December.|$|E

6000|$|... "No {{doubt you}} were, and my arrival is the signal for Mr. Newcome's bon jour. I am Bogey, and I frighten {{everybody}} away. By the scene which you witnessed yesterday, my good young friend, {{and all that}} painful esclandre on the promenade, you must see how absurd, and dangerous, and wicked--yes, wicked it is for parents to allow intimacies to spring up between young people, which can only lead to disgrace and unhappiness. Lady Dorking was another good-natured goose. I had not arrived yesterday ten minutes, when my maid came running in to tell me of what had occurred on the promenade; and, tired as I was, I went that instant to Jane Dorking and passed the evening with her, and that poor little creature to whom Captain Belsize behaved so cruelly. She does not care a fig for him--not one fig. Her childish inclination is passed away these two years, whilst Mr. Jack was performing his feats in prison; and if the wretch flatters himself that it was on his account she was agitated yesterday, he is perfectly mistaken, and you may tell him Lady Kew said so. She is subject to fainting fits. Dr. Finck has been attending her ever since she has been here. She fainted only last <b>Tuesday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sight of a rat walking about their lodgings (they have dreadful lodgings, the Dorkings), and no wonder she was frightened {{at the sight of}} that great coarse tipsy wretch! She is engaged, as you know, to your connexion, my grandson, Barnes:--in all respects a most eligible union. The rank of life of the parties suits them to one another. She is a good young woman, and Barnes has experienced from persons of another sort such horrors, that he will know the blessing of domestic virtue. It was high time he should. I say all this in perfect frankness to you.|$|E
6000|$|There {{are many}} {{brighter}} intervals which make one willing {{to suppose that}} if the wife {{had been a little}} more patient, more tolerant, more cheerful, less severely addicted to her sterile superstition, there might have been somewhat more happiness in the house. One misery of the present social ideal of women is that, while it keeps them so systematically ignorant, superstitious, and narrow, it leaves them without humility. [...] "Be content," [...] said the great John Wesley to his froward wife, [...] "be content to be a private insignificant person, known and loved by God and me. Of what importance is your character to mankind? If you was buried just now, or if you had never lived, what loss would it be to the cause of God?" [...] This energetic remonstrance can hardly be said to exhaust the matter. Still it puts a wholesome side of the case which Madame Diderot missed, and which better persons are likely to miss, so long as the exclusion of women, by common opinion or by law, from an active participation in the settlement of great issues, makes them indifferent to all interests outside domestic egoism, and egoistic and personal religion. Brighter intervals shone in the household. [...] "I announced my departure," [...] writes Diderot, [...] "for next <b>Tuesday.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> first word I saw the faces both of mother and daughter fall. The child had a compliment for my fête-day all ready, and it would not do to let her waste the trouble of having learnt it. The mother had projected a grand dinner for Sunday. Well, we arranged everything perfectly. I made my journey, and came back to be harangued and feasted. The poor child made her little speech in the most bewitching way. In the middle there came some hard words, so she stopped and said to me, 'My papa, 'tis because my two front teeth have come out'--as was true. Then she went on. At the end, as she had a posy to give me, and it could not be found, she stopped a second time to say to me--'Here's the worst of the tale; my pinks have got lost.' Then she started off in search of her flowers. We dined in great style. My wife had got all her friends together. I was very gay, eating, drinking, and doing the honours of my table to perfection. On rising from table I stayed among them and played cards instead of going out. I saw them all off between eleven and twelve: I was charming, and if you only knew with whom; what physiognomies, what folk, what talk!" ...|$|E
