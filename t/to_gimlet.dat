50|$|Rafsanjani was {{featured}} in the first season of Gimlet's podcast StartUp, consulting with her husband Alex Blumberg as he launched a media company then called American Podcasting Corporation. As the business grew, Rafsanjani elected to join the team, specifically to develop branded podcasts (podcasts produced by Gimlet on behalf of advertisers) {{as a source of}} revenue for the firm. The first branded podcast from Rafsanjani's four-person creative team at Gimlet was a six-episode series for eBay called Open for Business, which hit number one on the iTunes podcast chart. Rafsanjani has been praised for the journalism and producing skills she brings <b>to</b> <b>Gimlet's</b> marketing projects; hiring for her team at Gimlet Creative also drew from journalism, including Katelyn Bogucki from The Huffington Post and Frances Harlow from NPR's Planet Money.|$|R

On October 5, 2016, Ward announced {{at the beginning of}} season 1 episode 22 that Davidson and McKay had left the podcast. In episode 23 on January 19, 2017, Ward announced that she would be moving on <b>to</b> another <b>Gimlet</b> project and the show was then replaced by Flora Lichtman's Every Little Thing.|$|R
30|$|The {{relationship}} between the scalability of Gimlet and the entire code suite is different than for Reeber, chiefly because Gimlet execution takes significantly longer than does Reeber. For almost any number of sidecar processes in Figure  9, the time <b>to</b> execute <b>Gimlet</b> is longer than the corresponding 5 simulation time steps. (For 256 sidecar processes the two times are roughly equivalent.) As a result, Gimlet dominates the total code execution time, and the simulation+analysis strong scaling behavior follows that of Gimlet alone almost exactly.|$|R

60|$|So {{he helped}} Stuyvesant nail his ladder. Stuyvesant got a small <b>gimlet</b> <b>to</b> bore holes for the nails. Phonny {{thought that this}} was not necessary. He said they could drive the nails without boring. Stuyvesant said that there were three {{objections}} to this: first, they might not go straight, secondly, they might split the wood, and thirdly, they would cause the wood to break out, as he called it, where they came through on the other side.|$|R
5000|$|A {{self-tapping}} screw is a screw that can tap its own hole {{as it is}} driven into the material. For hard [...] such as metal or hard plastics, the self-tapping ability is often created by cutting {{a gap in the}} continuity of the thread on the screw, generating a [...] and cutting edge similar to those on a tap. Thus, whereas a regular machine screw cannot tap its own hole in a metal substrate, a self-tapping one can (within reasonable limits of substrate hardness and depth). For softer substrates such as wood or soft plastics, the self-tapping ability can come simply from a tip that tapers <b>to</b> a <b>gimlet</b> point (in which no flute is needed). Like the tip of a nail or gimlet, such a point forms the hole by displacement of the surrounding material rather than any chip-forming drilling/cutting/evacuating action.|$|R
2500|$|Following a flyoff {{against the}} T-214 rocket, which {{indicated}} {{the necessity to}} modify the rocket motor <b>to</b> reduce the <b>Gimlet's</b> visual signature, the Navy directed {{the development of a}} modified, 'hybrid' rocket, using the T-214's tail; this became known as [...] "T-Gimlet". The modified rocket was considered to be suitable for the Navy's purposes; both the original Gimlet and the T-Gimlet were ordered for production, a 5 million dollar USD contract being allotted to start production at the Shumaker Naval Ammunition Depot in Arkansas.|$|R

Father and mother keep very quiet, looking at me as if I were one of the lost, with hard, {{screwing}} eyes, like <b>gimlets.</b> <b>To</b> me they scarcely say anything, but they talk it all over with each other, and try and decide what is to be done. It's my belief that father has written to the people in Washington--what do you call it! the Department--to have you moved away from Brooklyn,--to have you sent to sea." ...|$|R
30|$|First {{we present}} results of some {{synthetic}} performance benchmarks, {{in order to}} establish baselines by which to compare the performance of real analyses performed by the Reeber and Gimlet. Then we present the results from the analysis codes themselves. We note that, although Nyx and other BoxLib-based codes use OpenMP to express intra-node parallelism, we disabled OpenMP for all performance tests presented below (in Nyx, Gimlet, and Reeber), since the focus of this work is primarily on inter-node relationships. Furthermore, because both the Box size and the total problem domain size of Nyx simulations is typically a power of 2, we use only up to 8 MPI processes per socket on an Edison compute node, always with only 1 MPI process per core. The extra 4 cores on each socket generally do not expedite the computation significantly, both due to load imbalance (12 and 24 rarely divide evenly into the problem domain size), {{as well as to the}} fact that, even with only 8 out of 12 cores active on a given socket, we already saturate most of the available memory bandwidth due to the low arithmetic intensity of the finite-volume algorithms in Nyx (Williams et al. 2009). Again, we applied this power-of- 2 rule <b>to</b> the <b>Gimlet</b> and Reeber codes as well.|$|R
500|$|Toscanini, Beecham {{and many}} others {{regarded}} Sargent as the finest choral conductor in the world. Even orchestral musicians gave him credit: the principal violist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra wrote of him, [...] "He is able to instil into the singers a life and efficiency they never dreamed of. You have only to see {{the eyes of a}} choral society screwing into him like hundreds of <b>gimlets</b> <b>to</b> understand what he means to them." [...] However, another of Sargent's colleagues, Sir Adrian Boult, said of him, [...] "e was a great all-rounder but never developed his potentialities, which were enormous, simply because he didn't think hard enough about music – he never troubled to improve on a successful interpretation. He was too interested in other things, and not single-minded enough about music." ...|$|R

50|$|Sargent was {{especially}} devoted to choral music. His special skills with singers were well described by Bernard Shore (the former principal viola of the BBC Symphony Orchestra) {{in his book}} The Orchestra Speaks: 'He is able to instil into the singers a life and efficiency they never dreamed of. You have only to see {{the eyes of a}} choral society screwing into him like hundreds of <b>gimlets,</b> <b>to</b> understand what he means to them. He is hypnotic with the choir - he plays upon the imagination and minds of the singers like a mesmerist.' Under Sargent the emphasis in the Society's repertoire shifted from adventurous new continental works to the 20th-century compositions of British composers: Herbert Howells's Hymnus Paradisi, Vaughan Williams's Sea Symphony, Delius's Sea Drift, Ireland's These things shall be, along with the classics of the choral repertory such as Haydn's Creation, Beethoven's Ninth and the Missa Solemnis, Handel's Messiah. Premieres were fewer than before: significant works included Golgotha by Frank Martin and Hodie by Vaughan Williams. Important events included the ceremonial opening of the new Royal Festival Hall in 1951 (with a concert of English music by Thomas Arne, Handel and Hubert Parry) and a memorial concert for King George VI (Messiah with the Royal Choral Society).|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean to say," [...] {{continued}} Dupin, while I merely {{laughed at}} his last observations, [...] "that if the Minister {{had been no}} more than a mathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check. I know him, however, as both mathematician and poet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew him as a courtier, too, and as a bold intriguant. Such a man, I considered, could not fail {{to be aware of the}} ordinary policial modes of action. He could not have failed to anticipate--and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate--the waylayings to which he was subjected. He must have foreseen, I reflected, the secret investigations of his premises. His frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the Prefect as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses, to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G--, in fact, did finally arrive--the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises. I felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of policial action in searches for articles concealed--I felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the Minister. It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, <b>to</b> the <b>gimlets,</b> and <b>to</b> the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw, in fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of course, to simplicity, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice. You will remember, perhaps, how desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested, upon our first interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so very self-evident." ...|$|R
