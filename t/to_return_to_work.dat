40|$|Objective: To study use and {{awareness}} of the Social Security Work Incentives (SSWIs) and to obtain empirical data on barriers <b>to</b> <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Study Design: Using parallel surveys and multiple sampling and recruitment strategies, the authors administered a brief survey about the SSWIs. Participants: Persons with a psychiatric disability (n= 539), service providers (n= 120), and family members (n= 174). Results: All groups registered the greatest concern {{about the loss of}} health insurance; this and other concerns were perceived as serious barriers <b>to</b> <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> There were differences in the perceptions of the 3 groups about the importance of disincentives <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and differences among consumers by demographic characteristics. Conclusions: Consumers, family members, and providers of services need more information about the work incentives, particularly if the goals of the new Ticket <b>to</b> <b>Work</b> legislation are <b>to</b> be realized.

5|$|On July 25 The New York Times {{reported}} that a general strike {{had taken place in}} Scranton. A committee representing the miners called a meeting with W. R. Storrs, coal superintendent.

5|$|The PTC's {{response}} to the strike was anemic and was interpreted by some contemporary observers and later historians as tacitly supporting the strike. Arthur Mitten, chairman of the company's Industrial Relations Division, stopped by the Luzerne carbarn and asked the workers <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Subsequently, he suggested that WMC temporarily suspend the non-discrimination order, and even brought a pile of freshly printed fliers with a suspension announcement to the WMC offices. However, the WMC officials refused to approve suspension of the FEPC order and Mitten's suspension fliers were not distributed. On the morning of August 1, PTC officials immediately shut down the high-speed lines, even before the strike had spread, and instructed the company supervisors to stop selling tickets. The PTC left its carbarns open, which allowed the strikers to use the carbarns as rallying points and coordinating centers for their activities. The company also cancelled the regularly scheduled meeting of its executive committee, where the {{response to}} the strike could have been discussed, and refused to join the TWU in a radio broadcast urging the strikers <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|Widespread strikes marked 1922, {{as labor}} sought redress for falling wages and {{increased}} unemployment. In April, 500,000 coal miners, led by John L. Lewis, struck over wage cuts.

As Harding proposed, the miners agreed <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> and Congress created a commission to look into their grievances.|$|E

5|$|A race riot {{broke out}} in May 1943 of whites against blacks.

That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; and whites objected to the change by rioting on May 24.

5|$|In 1921, a labour strike {{erupted in}} the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills in Madras. This strike was led by V. Kalyanasundara Mudaliar, {{a leader of the}} Indian National Congress. The strike lasted for over six months during which around 10,000 workers struck work. A {{crackdown}} was ordered. Eventually, two factions emerged; one group of workers desired <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> while another wished to continue the strike. Violent riots broke out when striking workers prevented the others from returning to work. The riots began to assume communal colours as the workers who wished to continue the strike were mostly caste Hindus while those who desired to end it were largely untouchables or Dalits.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Gompers of the AFL {{recognized}} that the strike was damaging the cause of labor {{in the public mind}} and advised the strikers <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Commissioner Curtis refused to re-hire the striking policemen. He was supported by Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, whose rebuke of Gompers earned him a national reputation. The strike proved a setback for labor unions, and the AFL discontinued its attempts to organize police officers for another two decades. Coolidge won the Republican nomination for vice-president of the U.S. in the 1920 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|The five {{previous}} {{series of}} One Foot in the Grave were produced {{and directed by}} Susan Belbin. She had retired because of ill health. Renwick persuaded her <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on the final series to provide continuity, but her health quickly forced her to resign from the show again. The final series was produced by Jonathon P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience working with Belbin on the earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, {{as well as on}} other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, which would aid the transition between directors.|$|E
