40|$|Abstract – As a {{consequence}} of the recent introduction of the pine wood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus in Portugal, nematodes of the genus Bursaphelenchus were looked for in various French pine forests, in trees attacked by Monochamus galloprovincialis, the vector insect of B. xylophilus, and in the insects themselves. <b>Trap</b> <b>trees</b> were felled in 12 localities distributed all over the country. Nematodes were extracted from transversal stem discs; insects emerging from the <b>trap</b> <b>trees</b> were studied. B. hellenicus, B. leoni, B. mucronatus and B. sexdentati were isolated, but not B. xylophilus. The presence of B. mucronatus and the absence of B. xylophilus were confirmed by molecular markers. B. mucronatus was isolated from several regions with an average prevalence of 19 %. The infestation of M. galloprovincialis by B. mucronatus reached 26. 7 %.

40|$|Summary. Changes in Gregarina typographi Fuchs, 1915 (Eugregarinorida: Gregarinidae) {{infection}} {{levels were}} studied {{in a population}} of the bark beetle Ips typographus (L., 1758) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), which lives in association with Norway spruce. Beetles were repeat-edly collected from three logs of <b>trap</b> <b>trees</b> during 2009 and 2010 at one study site in the Czech Republic {{with a high level}} of G. typographi infection (seasonal mean of 15. 7 % in 2009 and 19. 8 % in 2010). Infection levels did not differ statistically between sexes, logs, and <b>trap</b> <b>trees</b> but did differ among sampling dates. During the beetle reproductive period, the infection levels nearly doubled in 2009 (from 10. 7 to 19. 8 %) and more than tripled in 2010 (from 9. 3 to 31. 3 %). We infer that the continuous increase in the G. typographi infection level within each of the two years resulted from transmission among beetles in nuptial chambers during the May–June reproductive and egg-laying period...|$|R

Treatments included ash trap trees girdled {{in the lower}} 1. 5 m of the bole with either a clear sticky band or a purple sticky band wrapped above the wound, ungirdled ash trap trees, ash trap trees girdled at 3 m above the ground, ungirdled ash trap trees baited with Manuka oil release devices at 3 m above the ground, purple prism traps baited with Manuka oil, and non-ash ungirdled trap trees. Where available, ash trap trees girdled in the lower 1. 5 m of the bole in 2004 and 2005 with a clear sticky band around them were used. Sites used represented locations with high or low ash density and high, low, or very low emerald ash borer density.

40|$|The two {{eucalyptus}} borers Phoracantha semipunctata and P. recurva were accidently {{introduced in}} Tunisia in 1962 and 1999, respectively. Their relative distribution is still unknown {{and very little}} is known about their preferences and performances in various host species under different Tunisian climates. We combined field data and laboratory follow-up, in order to define their present distribution, their relative abundance and to test the effects of sites and Eucalyptus species on attack density, reproductive and developmental performances and productivity of insects. The study was carried out in Eucalyptus plantations of ten localities ranging from humid to arid. Choice preference and colonization of various selected Eucalyptus species by the two borers were studied with standing trap trees and trap logs. Tree species differed among localities, but all localities contained {{at least one of the}} two species E. gomphocephala and E. camaldulensis, both being well appreciated by the two Phoracantha species. It appeared that both beetle species were present in all localities but P recurva was dominant over P semipunctata everywhere. Insect characteristics depended on attack localization on tree stem; attack densities were higher on the lowest than on the upper parts. It is perfectly coherent that the density of emerging beetles correlated positively with attack density, number of young larval galleries, larval survival and adult success in the <b>trap</b> <b>tree</b> experiment. High larval survival and adult success resulted in high offspring productivity.

40|$|Agrilus planipennis (emerald ash borer, Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is a pest of ash (Fraxinus spp.) in North America and {{has caused}} {{mortality}} of ash throughout its introduced range. One technique used for detection of A. planipennis is {{the establishment and}} peeling of girdled trap trees. In {{an effort to reduce}} the search effort and target detection survey efforts within ash trap trees, a predictive model was created using data from 2007 and validated using data from 2008. In 2007 and 2008, ash trap trees were established, harvested, peeled and inspected for A. planipennis larvae. Gaussian curves were fit to describe the relationship between stem diameter and relative proportion and frequency of larvae. The observed and predicted 2008 relative proportion and frequency of larvae did not differ in paired t-tests. Within the relative proportion and frequency Gaussian models, the curves peaked at approximately 10 cm iameter signifying the greatest proportion and frequency of A. planipennis larvae occurred at 10 cm stem diameter. This peak was then bracketed by 2 cm on each side creating a target stem section with a top diameter of 8 cm and a bottom diameter of 12 cm. A simple linear regression was fit to describe the relationship between the larvae count within the targeted 8 – 12 cm section of tree and the larvae per cm 3 of phloem per tree for 2007. The observed and predicted 2008 larvae per cm 3 did not differ in a paired t-test. Targeting the 8 – 12 cm diameter section of the <b>trap</b> <b>tree</b> stem will reduce the amount of the tree peeled to less than 45 % with more than 50 % of A. planipennis larvae within the tree encountered in this targeted section. This reduction in the amount of tree peeled will greatly increase the number of trees and area surveyed for A. planipennis detection and population delimiting surveys...|$|E
40|$|The European woodwasp, Sirex noctilio F. (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) {{utilizes}} pine as {{its host}} during larval development. Females drill through pine bark to deposit eggs, a symbiotic fungus, Amylostereum, and phytotoxic mucus into the tree. In their native range, these insects are not viewed as primary pests because they attack dead or dying trees. Over the last century, this woodwasp has been accidentally introduced into several {{countries in the}} southern hemisphere. Some regions have incurred {{millions of dollars in}} damage to large plantations of the widely planted pine species, radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don). Sirex noctilio was discovered in northeastern United States and Canada in 2004. Prior studies have focused on damage done to pine stands in the southern hemisphere and, because those pines are not native, these studies may not be applicable to native pines in the U. S. The southeastern U. S. contains millions of hectares of possibly susceptible pine trees and, thus it is advisable to study the native Arkansas woodwasp, S. nigricornis F., (as a species with similar biology) in preparation for a possible invasion by its exotic counterpart. The objectives of this research were to 1) examine how shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.) logs (bolts) in moderate drought conditions of Arkansas lose moisture over time, and 2) determine oviposition preferences of Sirex nigricornis females in aging pine bolts. To complete these objectives, shortleaf pines were felled and moisture content was measured over a period of 45 days. Moisture content results were used to create parameters for oviposition choice experiments. After a cross-sectional cut was made, the most moisture loss occurs within 3 - 4 cm of bolt ends while the center of the bolt stays consistent during this time period. Females prefer to oviposit in recently cut bolts. Using these results, <b>trap</b> <b>tree</b> methods can be altered to create more efficient methods of siricid capture and laboratory rearing...|$|E
50|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} to prevent the start of beetle outbreaks. Some suggest using “trap trees” {{at the beginning of}} each reproductive cycle.

Another method is clearcutting, removing sections of trees at the first signs of infestation. Pheromone traps can be used.
