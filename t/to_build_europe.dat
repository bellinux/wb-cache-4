40|$|The {{plasticity}} of myeloid {{cells is}} illustrated by a diversity of functions including their role as effectors of innate immunity as macrophages (MACs) and bone remodelling as osteoclasts (OCs). TET 2, a methylcytosine dioxygenase highly expressed in these cells and frequently mutated in myeloid leukemias, may be a key contributor to this plasticity. Through transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses, we investigated 5 -methylcytosine (5 mC), 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC) and gene expression changes in two divergent terminal myeloid differentiation processes, namely MAC and OC differentiation. MACs and OCs undergo highly similar 5 hmC and 5 mC changes, despite their wide differences in gene expression. Many TET 2 - and thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) -dependent 5 mC and 5 hmC changes directly activate the common terminalmyeloid differentiation programme. However, the acquisition of differential features between MACs and OCs also depends on TET 2 /TDG. In fact, 5 mC oxidation precedes differential histone modification changes between MACs and OCs. TET 2 and TDG downregulation impairs the acquisition of such differential histone modification and expression patterns at MAC-/OC-specific genes. We prove that the histone H 3 K 4 methyltransferase SETD 1 A is differentially recruited between MACs and OCs in a TET 2 -dependent manner. We demonstrate a novel role of these enzymes {{in the establishment of}} specific elements of identity and function in terminal myeloid differentiation.

40|$|The French Government {{has had a}} {{paradoxical}} relationship with globalization. Globalization is perceived as both a threat to react against and a cradle for new policy ideas. French policymakers have a love-hate relationship with the European higher education reforms that started in the 1990 s, a mixed sentiment that French singer Serge Gainsbourg spoke of in his popular song, ‘Je t’aime moi non plus’. At the outset, most of higher education reforms, such as the Bologna declaration, were framed as a way <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>Europe</b> and fight against international competition. Yet, the mode of governance of these reforms mirrored the one recommended by international organizations {{and led to the}} precise outcome criticized in globalization, i. e. greater competition. This paper explores the relationship between international, European and domestic discourses and modes of governance. It uses insights from the literature on policy transfer to investigate such relationship and questions the sustainability of such ambivalent discourse. The French government should concentrate on the policy it started developing from 2007 consisting in opening French higher education to globalization.

However, little is known on how decision making in AN patients evolves in response to treatment or whether impairments are reversible. Method AN patients (n[*]=[*] 42) completed the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) upon admission to a 3 -month day-hospital treatment programme and at a 1 -year follow-up. Patient IGT performance was compared to age-matched controls (n[*]=[*] 46). Results AN patients displayed poorer performance on the IGT at admission compared to controls (p[*]<[*]. 001). Patients with full remission (n[*]=[*] 31; 73. 9 %) at the 1 -year follow-up improved IGT performance (p[*]=[*] 0. 007), and scores were similar compared to controls (p[*]=[*] 0. 557). AN patients with partial/no remission at follow-up (n[*]=[*] 11; 26. 1 %) did not improve IGT scores (p[*]=[*] 0. 867). Conclusions These findings uphold that enduring remission from AN can reverse decision-making impairments, and they might be most likely explained by clinical state rather than a trait vulnerability.

Concentrations of orex in-A and sleep were evaluated in 26 obese, 40 morbid obe se and 32 healthy-weight participants. The sleep monitor Actiwatch AW 7 and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used to evaluate sleep. The Symptom Checklist- 90 -Revised was administered to assess symptoms of psychopathology. A higher weight status was associated with elevated orexin-A levels (p =. 050), greater depression, anxiety and somatization symptoms (all: p <. 001), and impoverished self-reported sleep quality (p <. 001). A quadratic trend was found in objective sleep time, being longest in the obese group (p =. 031). Structural equation modelling showed plasma orexin-A to be related to poor total sleep quality, which in turn was associated with elevated body mass index. Our data conﬁrm an interaction between elevated plasma orexin-A concentrations and poor sleep that contributes to ﬂuctuations in body mass index.

40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease with both motor and non-motor manifestations. Hyposmia {{is one of the}} early non-motor symptoms, which can precede motor symptoms by several years. The relationship between hyposmia and PD remains elusive. Olfactory bulb (OB) pathology shows an increased number of olfactory dopaminergic cells, protein aggregates and dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems. In this study we examined tissue levels of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) and their metabolites, of noradrenaline (NA) and of the amino acid neurotransmitters aspartate, glutamate, taurine and γ-aminobutyric acid in OBs of 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treated Macaca fascicularis in different stages, includin g monkeys who were always asymptomatic, monkeys who recovered from mild parkinsonian signs, and monkeys with stable moderate or severe parkinsonism. DA was increased compared to controls, while neither NA and 5 -HT nor the amino acid neurotransmitters were significantly changed. Furthermore, DA increased before stable motor deficits appear with + 51 % in asymptomatic and + 96 % in recovered monkeys. Unchanged DA metabolites suggest a special metabolic profile of the newly formed DA neurons. Significant correlation of homovanillic acid (HVA) with taurine single values within the four MPTP groups and of aspartate with taurine within the asymptomatic and recovered MPTP groups, but not within the controls suggest interactions in the OB between taurine and the DA system and taurine and the excitatory neurotransmitter triggered by MPTP. This first investigation of OB in various stages after MPTP administration suggests that the DA increase seems to be an early phenomenon, not requiring profound nigrostriatal neurodegeneration or PD symptoms.

40|$|Noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) {{receptor}} antagonists {{can produce}} {{positive and negative}} symptomatology as well as impairment of cognitive function that closely resemble those present in schizophrenia. In rats, these drugs induce a behavioral syndrome (characterized by hyperlocomotion and stereotypies), an enhanced glutamatergic transmission in the medial prefrontal cortex, and damage to retrosplenial cortical neurons in adult rats, which was measured as the induction of the stress protein 72 / 73 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp 72 / 73). In the present work we have examined the existence of possible differences among different antipsychotic drugs in their capacity to block immunolabeling of Hsp 72 / 73 in the retrosplenial cortex of the rat induced by the potent NMDA receptor antagonist, MK- 801. In addition, the effects of selective monoaminergic agents were also studied to delineate the particular receptors responsible {{for the actions of}} antipsychotic drugs. Pretreatment with clozapine, chlorpromazine, olanzapine, ziprasidone -and to a lesser extent haloperidol- reduced the formation of Hsp 72 / 73 protein in the rat retrosplenial cortex after the administration of MK- 801. In addition, antagonism at dopamine D 2 (raclopride), 5 -HT 2 A (M 100907) and α 1 -adrenoceptors (prazosin) as well as agonism at 5 -HT 1 A receptors (BAY x 3702) also diminished the MK- 801 -induced number of cells labeled with Hsp 72 / 73. Each of these effects may contribute to antipsychotic action. The results suggest that the efficacy of atypical antipsychotic drugs in the clinic may result from a combined effect on 5 -HT 2 A, 5 -HT 1 A and α 1 -adrenergic receptors added to the classical dopamine D 2 receptor antagonism.

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Orexins/hypocretins are orexigenic {{peptides}} {{implicated in the}} regulation of feeding behavior and the sleep/wake cycle. Little {{is known about the}} functioning of these peptides in anorexia nervosa (AN). The aims of the current study were to evaluate the extent to which orexin-A might be linked to sleep and treatment outcome in AN. Method Fasting plasma orexin-A concentrations were measured in 48 females with AN {{at the start of a}} day hospital treatment and in 98 normal-eater/healthy-weight controls. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was administered at the beginning of the treatment as a measure of sleep quality. Other psychopathological variables were evaluated with the Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL 90 R) and the Eating Disorder Inventory- 2 (EDI). Patients were assessed at the start and end of treatment by means of commonly used diagnostic criteria and clinical questionnaires. Results The AN patients presented more sleep disturbances and poorer overall sleep quality than did the healthy controls (p =. 026) but there were no global differences between groups in plasma orexin-A concentrations (p =. 071). In the AN sample, orexin-A concentrations were associated with greater sleep disturbances (|r| =. 30), sleep inefficiency (|r| =. 22) and poorer overall sleep (|r| =. 22). Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) showed that both elevated orexin-A concentrations and inadequate sleep predicted poorer treatment outcome. Conclusion Plasma orexin-A concentrations contribute to poor sleep quality in AN, and both of these variables are associated with therapy response.

40|$|Background] The {{rise of the}} primate lineage is {{accompanied}} by an outstanding emergence of microRNAs, small non-coding RNAs with {{a prominent role in}} gene regulation. In spite of their biological importance {{little is known about the}} way in which natural selection has influenced microRNAs in the human lineage. To study the recent evolutionary history of human microRNAs and to analyze the signatures of natural selection in genomic regions harbouring microRNAs we have investigated the nucleotide substitution rates of 1, 872 human microRNAs in the human and chimpanzee lineages. [Results] We produced a depurated set of microRNA alignments of human, chimpanzee and orang-utan orthologs combining BLAT and liftOver and selected 1, 214 microRNA precursors presenting optimal secondary structures. We classified microRNAs in categories depending on their genomic organization, duplication status and conservation along evolution. We compared substitution rates of the aligned microRNAs between human and chimpanzee using Tajima’s Relative Rate Test taking orang-utan as out-group and found several microRNAs with particularly high substitution rates in either the human or chimpanzee branches. We fitted different models of natural selection on these orthologous microRNA alignments and compared them using a likelihood ratio test that uses ancestral repeats and microRNA flanking regions as neutral sequences. We found that although a large fraction of human microRNAs is highly conserved among the three species studied, significant differences in rates of molecular evolution exist among microRNA categories. Particularly, primate-specific microRNAs, which are enriched in isolated and single copy microRNAs, more than doubled substitution rates of those belonging to older, non primate-specific microRNA families. [Conclusions] Our results corroborate the remarkable conservation of microRNAs, a proxy of their functional relevance, and indicate that a subset of human microRNAs undergo nucleotide substitutions at higher rates, which may be suggestive of the action of positive selection.

40|$|The {{recreational}} drugs, {{alcohol and}} 3, 4 -Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, "Ecstasy") {{have both been}} shown to cause immune activation in vivo, and they are linked to cognitive impairment and anxiety-like behaviors in rodents. The neuronal effects of these drugs in the hippocampal area, {{an area that has}} been a focus of studies aiming to explain the mechanisms underlying anxiety related-disorders, remains poorly understood. Therefore we investigated the specific inflammatory impact of alcohol and MDMA on this area of the brain and on a hippocampal-related behavioral task. We centered our study on two inflammatory factors linked to anxiety-related disorders, namely Interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We subjected drug-consuming mice to a battery of behavioral tests to evaluate general activity, anxiety-like and depressive-live behaviors. We then introduced them to a contextual fear discrimination task and immune-related effects were examined by immunohistochemical and biochemical studies. Our results suggest that there is a relationship between the induction of immune activated pathways by voluntary alcohol consumption and a high-dose MDMA. Furthermore, the ability of mice to perform a contextual fear discrimination task was impaired by drug consumption and we report long term inflammatory alterations in the hippocampus even several weeks after drug intake. This information will be helpful for discovering new selective drug targets, and to develop treatments and preventive approaches for patients with anxiety-related disorders.

40|$|Mitofusin 2 (MFN 2) plays {{critical}} {{roles in}} both mitochondrial fusion {{and the establishment}} of mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) interactions. Hypothalamic ER stress has emerged as a causative factor for the development of leptin resistance, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we show that mitochondria-ER contacts in anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the hypothalamus are decreased in diet-induced obesity. POMC-specific ablation of Mfn 2 resulted in loss of mitochondria-ER contacts, defective POMC processing, ER stress-induced leptin resistance, hyperphagia, reduced energy expenditure, and obesity. Pharmacological relieve of hypothalamic ER stress reversed these metabolic alterations. Our data establish MFN 2 in POMC neurons as an essential regulator of systemic energy balance by fine-tuning the mitochondrial-ER axis homeostasis and function. This previously unrecognized role for MFN 2 argues for a crucial involvement in mediating ER stress-induced leptin resistance. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Background: Some {{studies have}} {{analyzed}} {{the relation between}} well-being and mortality {{but none of them}} have attempted to disentangle the differential influence that positive affect, negative affect, and evaluative well-being might have on mortality using a longitudinal design in the general population and measuring independently and accurately each component of well-being. The aim of the present study is to assess the association of these well-being components with mortality after adjusting for health and other lifestyle factors and to analyze whether this association is different in people with and without depression. Methods: A nationally representative sample of 4753 people from Spain was followed up after 3 years. Analyses were performed with Cox regression models among the total sample and separately in people with and without depression. Results: In the analyses adjusted for age, sex, and years of education, all three well-being variables showed separately a statistically significant association with mortality. However, after adjustment for health status and other confounders including the other well-being components, only positive affect remained as marginally associated with a decreased risk of mortality in the overall sample [HR = 0. 87; 95 % CI = 0. 73 - 1. 03], in particular among individuals without depression [HR = 0. 82; 95 % CI = 0. 68 - 0. 99]. Conclusion: Positive affect is inversely associated with mortality in individuals without depression. Future research should focus on assessing interventions associated with a higher level of positive affect.

40|$|Genetic {{changes in}} {{regulatory}} elements {{are likely to}} result in phenotypic effects that might explain population-specific as well as species-specific traits. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are posttranscriptional repressors involved in the control of almost every biological process. These small noncoding RNAs are present in various phylogenetic groups, and a large number of them remain highly conserved at the sequence level. MicroRNA-mediated regulation depends on perfect matching between the seven nucleotides of its seed region and the target sequence usually located at the 3 ′ untranslated region of the regulated gene. Hence, even single changes in seed regions are predicted to be deleterious as they may affect miRNA target specificity. In accordance to this, purifying selection has strongly acted on these regions. Comparison between the genomes of present-day humans from various populations, Neanderthal, and other nonhuman primates showed an miRNA, miR- 1304, that carries a polymorphism on its seed region. The ancestral allele is found in Neanderthal, nonhuman primates, at low frequency (∼ 5) in modern Asian populations and rarely in Africans. Using miRNA target site prediction algorithms, we found that the derived allele increases the number of putative target genes for the derived miRNA more than ten-fold, indicating an important functional evolution for miR- 1304. Analysis of the predicted targets for derived miR- 1304 indicates an association with behavior and nervous system development and function. Two of the predicted target genes for the ancestral miR- 1304 allele are important genes for teeth formation, enamelin, and amelotin. MicroRNA overexpression experiments using a luciferase-based assay showed that the ancestral version of miR- 1304 reduces the enamelin-and amelotin-associated reporter gene expression by 50, whereas the derived miR- 1304 does not have any effect. Deletion of the corresponding target sites for miR- 1304 in these dental genes avoided their repression, which further supports their regulation by the ancestral miR- 1304. Morphological studies described several differences in the dentition of Neanderthals and present-day humans like slower dentition timing and thicker enamel for present-day humans. The observed miR- 1304 -mediated regulation of enamelin and amelotin could at least partially underlie these differences between the two Homo species as well as other still-unraveled phenotypic differences among modern human populations.

30|$|The EDE like a {{political}} strategy {{could be the}} political answer of the Members States to the European educational challenges {{in the near future}} (an old innovation for a new time, characterised by a real unity in diversity).

Finally, is important to highlight that this work is a political proposal based on the idea of the EDE, like the essence of the acquis communautaire obtained in the recent European history and its educational and political issues. All the collateral aspects of its development in other European dimensions (political, cultural, social, etc.) need to be reviewed and re-thought by the main agents involved. These proposals include a beginning of a deliberation process and intend to give a first step to launch the redefinition process <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a new <b>Europe</b> in the 21 st century through education and citizenship.|$|R
