After each water cooler rendezvous, the number of individuals who have heard the rumor roughly doubles (though this doesn't account for gossiping twice to the same person; perhaps Alice tries to tell the story to Frank, only to find that Frank already heard it from Dave).

Numerous authors recommend that tests for VO 2 max should last no longer as 12  min, as prolonged tests could lead to inconsistent results [4, 23].

Finally, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>protocol</b> is highly correlative to running economy and actual VO 2 max consumption with outdoor running.

We then consider applications of secure MPC in on-line marketplaces, where customers select resources advertised by providers and it is desired to ensure privacy to the extent possible. Problems here are more naturally formulated in terms of boolean circuits, and we study the performance of our MPC implementation relative to existing ones that use an arithmetic-circuit representation. Our protocol easily handles tens of customers/providers and thousands of resources, and outperforms existing implementations including FairplayMP [3], VIFF [10], and SEPIA [7]. ...|$|E
