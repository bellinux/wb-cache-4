5|$|The General Society of Mayflower Descendants, or <b>The</b> <b>Mayflower</b> Society, is a genealogical {{organization}} {{of individuals who}} have documented their descents from {{one or more of}} the 102 passengers who arrived on <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower</b> in 1620. The Society, founded at Plymouth in 1897, claims that tens of millions of Americans descend from these passengers, and it offers research services to people seeking to document such descents.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mayflower</b> II is a {{full-size}} replica of <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower,</b> the ship which brought the Pilgrims to Plymouth in 1620. It {{is located at}} the State Pier in Plymouth Center. The ship is open as a museum about the Pilgrims' historic voyage from Plymouth, England, and is considered a faithful replica of the original Mayflower. It is officially a part of Plimoth Plantation.|$|E

50|$|Two months prior, during <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower's</b> {{grand opening}} party, Jenna and Ryan spiked Eleanor's drink with drugs. Keller raped Eleanor {{while she was}} {{intoxicated}} and was directly responsible for her death. Henry found Keller burying Eleanor's body in <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower's</b> basement crawlspace and is ordered to delete the surveillance files {{to cover up the}} crime.|$|R

5|$|Plymouth Colony did {{not have}} a royal charter authorizing it to form a government, yet some means of {{governance}} was needed. <b>The</b> <b>Mayflower</b> Compact was the colony's first governing document, signed by the 41 able-bodied Separatists aboard <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower</b> upon their arrival in Provincetown Harbor on November 21, 1620. Formal laws were not codified until 1636. The colony's laws were based on a hybrid of English common law and religious law as laid out in the Bible. The colonial authorities were deeply influenced by Calvinist theology, and were convinced that democracy was the form of government mandated by God.|$|E
5|$|During the winter, <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower</b> colonists {{suffered}} {{greatly from}} lack of shelter, diseases such as scurvy, and general conditions onboard ship. Many of the able-bodied men were too infirm to work; 45 out of 102 pilgrims died and were buried on Cole's Hill. Thus, only seven residences (of a planned nineteen) and four common houses were constructed during the first winter. By the end of January, enough of the settlement had been built to begin unloading provisions from <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower.</b> In mid-February, after several tense encounters with local Native Americans, the male residents of the settlement organized themselves into military orders; Myles Standish was designated as the commanding officer. By {{the end of the}} month, five cannons had been defensively positioned on Fort Hill. John Carver was elected governor to replace Governor Martin.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower</b> settlers' first {{explorations of}} Cape Cod, they came across {{evidence}} that Europeans had previously spent extensive time there. They discovered {{remains of a}} European fort and uncovered a grave that contained the remains of both an adult European male and a Native American child.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mayflower's</b> [...] "upscale small car" [...] {{position}} did {{not find}} a ready market and sales did not meet Standard's expectations. Standard's next small car, the Standard Eight of 1953, was a basic 0.8-litre economy car.|$|R
5|$|Plymouth, the shire town of {{the county}} and capital of the colony. This was the {{original}} 1620 settlement of <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower</b> Pilgrims, and continued as {{the largest and most}} significant settlement in the colony until its dissolution in 1691.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mayflower</b> first {{anchored}} in {{what became the}} harbor of Provincetown, Massachusetts on November 11, 1620. The ship was headed for {{the mouth of the}} Hudson River near Manhattan, which was part of the Colony of Virginia at the time, but it eventually reached New England.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} built in Brixham, England in 1956, and sailed to Plymouth across the Atlantic Ocean in 1957 by famous mariner Alan Villiers. The ship is still seaworthy, and {{routinely}} takes voyages around Plymouth Harbor. In the year 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower</b> II celebrated the 50th anniversary of its arrival in Plymouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cousin Frank," [...] asked Lucy, awfully, [...] "what if {{we should}} meet <b>the</b> <b>Mayflowers</b> now?"--the Mayflowers being a very ancient and noble Boston family whose {{acquaintance}} was the great pride and terror of our friends' lives.|$|R

During her time there, Hickok's nominal address was at <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower</b> Hotel in DC, where she met most people. Also during this time, she formed an intense {{friendship}} with Marion Janet Harron, a United States Tax Court judge who was ten years younger than she and almost {{the only person to}} visit her at the White House.|$|E
5|$|Taylor was a {{descendant}} of Elder William Brewster, the Pilgrim colonist leader of the Plymouth Colony, a Mayflower immigrant, {{and one of the}} signers of <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower</b> Compact; and Isaac Allerton Jr., a colonial merchant and colonel who was the son of Mayflower Pilgrim Isaac Allerton and Fear Brewster. Taylor's second cousin through that line was James Madison, the fourth president.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Hotel {{was built}} between 1882 and 1887. It had seven floors, 500 rooms {{and a large}} ballroom which has largely survived intact from its {{original}} design. The original reception room was renamed <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower</b> Room in 1923, and is now called the Salon. Unlike other hotels on Northumberland Avenue that were {{taken over by the}} War Office, the Grand has survived as an entertainment and exhibition venue.|$|E

50|$|Two early {{areas of}} {{settlement}} were Plymouth (c 1620) and Nantasket (c 1621). The Plymouth Colony began with <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower's</b> landing {{and is a}} well-known story. The Nantasket settlement followed soon after that of Plymouth. Roger Conant was at these two settlements before going north to Cape Ann.|$|R
5|$|Using the {{financing}} {{secured from the}} Merchant Adventurers, the Colonists bought provisions and obtained passage on two ships: <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower</b> and the Speedwell. They had intended to leave early in 1620, but they were delayed several months due to difficulties {{in dealing with the}} Merchant Adventurers, including several changes in plans for the voyage and in financing. The congregation and the other colonists finally boarded the Speedwell in July 1620 in the Dutch port of Delfshaven.|$|E
5|$|A regular {{international}} ferry {{service provided}} by Brittany Ferries operates from Millbay taking cars and foot passengers directly to France (Roscoff) and Spain (Santander) {{on the three}} ferries, MV Armorique, MV Bretagne and MV Pont-Aven. The Cremyll Ferry is a passenger ferry between Stonehouse and the Cornish hamlet of Cremyll, which {{is believed to have}} operated continuously since 1204. There is also a pedestrian ferry from <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower</b> Steps to Mount Batten, and an alternative to using the Tamar Bridge via the Torpoint Ferry (vehicle and pedestrian) across the River Tamar.|$|E
5|$|After the {{departure}} of Massasoit and his men, Squanto remained in Plymouth to teach the Pilgrims how to survive in New England, for example using dead fish to fertilize the soil. For {{the first few years}} of colonial life, the fur trade was the dominant source of income, buying furs from Native Americans and selling to Europeans, beyond subsistence farming. Shortly after {{the departure}} of <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower,</b> Governor Carver suddenly died. William Bradford was elected to replace him and went on to lead the colony through much of its formative years.|$|E

5|$|Massachusetts {{has a long}} {{political}} history; earlier {{political structures}} included <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower</b> Compact of 1620, the separate Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies, and the combined colonial Province of Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Constitution was ratified in 1780 while the Revolutionary War was in progress, {{four years after the}} Articles of Confederation was drafted, and eight years before the present United States Constitution was ratified on June 21, 1788. Drafted by John Adams, the Massachusetts Constitution is currently the oldest functioning written constitution in continuous effect in the world. It has been amended 120 times, most recently in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Cremyll Ferry {{lands in}} Devon at Stonehouse, {{one of the}} Three Towns {{that make up the}} modern city of Plymouth. The path follows roads past Stonehouse Barracks and Millbay Docks to Plymouth Hoe with its views across Plymouth Sound. It then crosses Sutton Harbour by <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower</b> Steps then skirts the hill of Cattedown to cross the River Plym by the Laira Bridge to Plymstock. Passing round the edge of the tidal Hooe Lake, the path regains the {{countryside}} above Jennycliff Bay, part of the Plymouth Sound, Shores and Cliffs Site of Special Scientific Interest, and follows the cliffs past Bovisand to Wembury, Wembury Marine Centre.|$|E
5|$|The General Court, as the {{legislative}} and judicial bodies, and the Governor, {{as the chief}} executive of the colony, constituted a political system of division of power. It followed a recommendation in John Calvin's political theory to set up several institutions which complement and control each other in a system of checks and balances in order to minimize the misuse of political power. In 1625, the settlers had repaid their debts and thus gained complete possession of the colony. The colony was de facto a republic, since neither an English company nor the King and Parliament exerted any influence—a representative democracy governed on the principles of <b>the</b> <b>Mayflower</b> Compact ("self-rule").|$|E
