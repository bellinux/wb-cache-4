Knauf did not deny a stylistic link and made comparisons to John Steinbeck's novel <b>The</b> <b>Grapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wrath.</b> When Lost began to receive major critical attention, Carnivàle and its type of mythological storytelling were compared to Lost story approach in several instances.|$|E

It began with what he {{suggests}} was best January in cinema history. <b>The</b> <b>Grapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wrath,</b> His Girl Friday and The Shop Around the Corner, all considered classics, were released in January 1940. Later in the decade, other classic films would first reach screens during January, such as Sullivan's Travels, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E

The film serves as a satire of the social conditions, dominant practices, and ideologies of Hollywood, as well as the film industry's perceived mistreatment of actors.

When he was minister of water resources and electricity, massive power projects were realized in Baddawi and Zahrani, Zouk and Baalbeck, and massive electrical grid installation and distribution throughout Lebanon, including the outlying areas still in turmoil with Israeli Forces in the south, hence the progress was too slow compared to the massive increase in the Megawatts needed, since little electricity projects were accomplished over 18 years of civil unrest, mainly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Israeli Operation <b>Grapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wrath.</b> In 2000, Hobeika lost his parliament seat, due to active Syrian interference against him in the election.|$|R
