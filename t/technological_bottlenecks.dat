50|$|Due to the <b>technological</b> <b>bottlenecks</b> China {{faced in}} the early 1990s, it was {{impossible}} to provide the power source for every single transceiver of the APAR. Instead, the design team took an approach similar to that of British MESAR and Israeli EL/M-2075 APARs by group four transceivers into a transmitting/receiving (T/R) module with 100W peak power, and each T/R module was powered by its own power source. Each T/R module was sized twenty centimeter in width, five centimeter in thickness and forty-five centimeter in length. By April 1993, the team finally successfully developed the required T/R module, which eventually won 2nd place Science and Technology Advancement Award given by the Ministry of Electronic Industry of China in 1994.|$|E
40|$|International audienceToday the {{development}} of digital libraries is reaching technological limits due {{to the difficulty of}} automatically processing a growing mass of digitized images of documents from different origins. The main problem is the high cost of the digitization and retro-conversion processes which include image capture and indexation, metadata extraction, image storage, conversion in reusable electronic form, publication on the Internet and reduction of image weights for faster access. To reduce the cost of digitization and retro-conversion, we need to break <b>technological</b> <b>bottlenecks</b> like {{the development}} of "intelligent" digitizers which reduce manual intervention and produce the best quality images. Retro-conversion needs efficient software which analyze images contents and automatically extract all necessary information for image indexing.
