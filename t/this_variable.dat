5|$|The common {{starling}} is a noisy bird. Its song {{consists of}} a wide variety of both melodic and mechanical-sounding noises as part of a ritual succession of sounds. The male is the main songster and engages in bouts of song lasting for a minute or more. Each of these typically includes four varieties of song type, which follow each other in a regular order without pause. The bout starts with a series of pure-tone whistles and these are followed by the main part of the song, a number of variable sequences that often incorporate snatches of song mimicked from other species of bird and various naturally occurring or man-made noises. The structure and simplicity of the sound mimicked is of greater importance than the frequency with which it occurs. In some instances, a wild starling has been observed to mimic a sound it has heard only once. Each sound clip is repeated several times before the bird moves on to the next. After <b>this</b> <b>variable</b> section comes a number of types of repeated clicks followed by a final burst of high-frequency song, again formed of several types. Each bird has its own repertoire with more proficient birds having a range of up to 35 variable song types and as many as 14 types of clicks.|$|E

A useful choice is the short-circuit current output of the amplifier (leading to the short-circuit current gain).

25|$|Since the {{entering}} variable will, in general, increase from 0 {{to a positive}} number, {{the value of the}} objective function will decrease if the derivative of the objective function with respect to <b>this</b> <b>variable</b> is negative.

One variable changed {{the magnitude of the}} opposite side. In many cases, <b>this</b> <b>variable</b> changed sign; the hypotenuse could coincide with the adjacent side (a zero input), or move beyond the adjacent side, representing a sign change.|$|E
25|$|SOMs {{have been}} helpful to {{researchers}} in identifying and investigating the constraints and variables of interest {{in a number of}} acquisition processes, and in exploring the consequences of these findings on linguistic and cognitive theories.

25|$|Critics of the Kuznets curve theory {{argue that}} its U-shape {{comes not from}} {{progression}} {{in the development of}} individual countries, but rather from historical differences between countries. For instance, many of the middle income countries used in Kuznets' data set were in Latin America, a region with historically high levels of inequality. When controlling for <b>this</b> <b>variable,</b> the U-shape of the curve tends to disappear (e.g. Deininger and Squire, 1998). Regarding the empirical evidence, based on large panels of countries or time series approaches, Fields (2001) considers the Kuznets hypothesis refuted.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{distribution}} of cones in the eye, the tristimulus values depend on the observer's field of view. To eliminate <b>this</b> <b>variable,</b> the CIE defined a color-mapping function called the standard (colorimetric) observer, to represent an average human's chromatic response within a 2° arc inside the fovea. This angle was chosen owing {{to the belief that}} the color-sensitive cones resided within a 2° arc of the fovea. Thus the CIE 1931 Standard Observer function is also known as the CIE 1931 2° Standard Observer. A more modern but less-used alternative is the CIE 1964 10° Standard Observer, which is derived from the work of Stiles and Burch, and Speranskaya.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{source of}} heterogeneity among study results is {{the variation in}} techniques used to assess vitamin concentrations in milk. HPLC {{was selected as the}} ‘‘gold standard’’ method for determination of fat-soluble vitamins by AOAC International. No gold standard has been identified for water-soluble vitamins; fluorescence spectroscopy, chromatography, and microbiological methods are all referenced in the AOAC official methods. Metaregression for vitamin B1 and folate studies revealed a significant association between study and method used to quantify vitamins; however, <b>this</b> <b>variable</b> was not significant for other vitamins. Analytic methods must take into consideration separation of vitamers for each vitamin, the methodology used for calibration of external standards, retention of vitamer conformation, and successful recovery. The solvents, standards, execution of extraction procedures, and equipment used to carry out these analyses may differ among investigators and can introduce variation among studies. Hollman et al. investigated 18 laboratories that were asked to analyze water-soluble vitamin contents in selected foods. These authors reported that in contrast to the fat-soluble vitamins a wider range of methods was used for water-soluble vitamins and that results from different methods did not always agree for vitamins B2 and C.|$|E

2500|$|The {{climate is}} [...] unique {{due to the}} many {{different}} wind patterns that flow throughout the region, traveling {{from east to west}} and north to south. Due to the fact that this region is geographically positioned {{in the center of the}} United States and Canada, there are many different air mass types that pass through and affect the constantly shifting weather patterns. This means that the Great Plains has a less consistent climate due to its central location than a region located on the coast. This is shown by how the western Great Plains is semi-arid, while the eastern portion of the Great Plains is much wetter. It has the four seasons of summer, autumn, winter, spring, but each season brings new extremes in the weather conditions. For example, the southern portions of the region typically experience 70 to 100 days each year over 90°F, while the northern portions typically see only 10 to 20 days above 90°F. It’s the air masses that come in from all directions that bring <b>this</b> <b>variable</b> climate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difficulty}} of deep dyslexics in reading abstract words has {{been referred to}} as the [...] "imageability effect". According to this idea, the ease with which a mental image can be created for a word is strongly related to the ease of reading the word. In an attempt to explain this relationship, researchers have developed a variable to link the mental imagery created by a word and the ease of reading it. <b>This</b> <b>variable,</b> ease of predication, is a rating of {{how easy it is to}} come up with simple factual statements or attributes of a word. For example, when presented with the word [...] "dog", an individual may come up with statements, or predicates, such as [...] "has four legs", [...] "is an animal", or [...] "barks and wags its tail". Words with higher ease of predication scores are more easily read aloud by deep dyslexics than words with lower ease of predicaton scores, yet there is no correlation between ease of predication and ease of reading seen in normal adult readers. Ease of predication may not explain specific symptoms of deep dyslexia, but rather indicates that deep dyslexics read using imagery, or a predicational route, rather than the more precise mechanisms used in normal reading.|$|E
