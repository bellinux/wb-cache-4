5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E

5|$|In the past, Native Americans ate {{the flesh}} of {{horseshoe}} crabs, and used the tail spines as spear tips and the shells to bail water out of their canoes. More recent attempts to use horseshoe crabs as food for livestock were abandoned when {{it was found that}} this gave the meat a bad taste. Horseshoe crab blood contains a clotting agent, limulus amebocyte lysate, which is used to test antibiotics and kidney machines to ensure that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> of dangerous bacteria, and to detect spinal meningitis and some cancers.|$|E
5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E

Once again, their surroundings melt away as they awaken underground again in the cave. Mulder sticks his hand through the earth ceiling as Skinner {{and a team of}} rescue staff manage to locate them and drag them out and haul them to the safety of an ambulance.

This freedom from tax liability applies not just to charitable trusts, but also to people who donate to them. Individuals who donate via Gift Aid are free from paying tax on that amount, while companies who give gifts to charity can claim tax on the amount back from HM Revenue & Customs.|$|E

25|$|In Michigan, sheriffs are constitutionally mandated, elected county officials.

Occasionally, this results in conflict over jurisdiction between municipal police agencies and sheriff's offices.|$|E
