50|$|A {{ring frame}} was {{constructed}} from cast iron, and later pressed steel. On {{each side of}} the frame are the spindles, above them are draughting (drafting) rollers and on top is a creel loaded with bobbins of roving. The roving (unspun thread) passes downwards from the bobbins to the draughting rollers. Here the back roller steadied the incoming thread, while the front rollers rotated faster, pulling the roving out and making the fibres more parallel. The rollers are individually adjustable, originally by mean of levers and weights. The attenuated roving now passes through a <b>thread</b> <b>guide</b> that is adjusted to be centred above the spindle. Thread guides are on a thread rail which allows them to be hinged out of the way for doffing or piecing a broken thread. The attenuated roving passes down to the spindle assembly, where it is threaded though a small D ring called the traveller. The traveller moves along the ring. It is this that gives the ring frame its name. From here the thread is attached to the existing thread on the spindle.|$|E
30|$|The {{operative}} {{principle is}} based on stretching of the vaginal membrane intraabdominally. Via a pluggable segmented dummy, which is connected to two threads, pressure is continuously exerted on the vaginal membrane resulting in the formation by stretching of a neovagina {{within a matter of}} days. Using the vagino-abdominal perforation method of Wallwiener the two threads are drawn intraabdominally from the vaginal membrane using the straight single-prong <b>thread</b> <b>guide,</b> by means of which the vaginal membrane is perforated (through a single perforation), and then pulled outside the abdominal wall with a large curved <b>thread</b> <b>guide</b> which is positioned retroperitoneally from cranial to caudal. Using the abdomino-vaginale perforation method of Fedele one of the curved thread guides is used. This <b>thread</b> <b>guide</b> is also positioned retroperitoneally from cranial to caudal, then the vaginal membrane is perforated with this <b>thread</b> <b>guide</b> and the threads executing traction are threaded extraabdominal/extravaginal and then also pulled outside the abdominal wall. Outside the abdomen the threads are held taut by a traction device and tightened daily so that a constant stretching pressure is exerted on the vaginal membrane.|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A monitored <b>thread</b> <b>guiding</b> device in a knitting machine, in which at least one <b>thread</b> is <b>guided</b> under predetermined tension along a free thread transport zone, has unit(s) for supplying the thread along the zone and a unit for receiving and/or further <b>guiding</b> the tensioned <b>thread.</b> An optical sensor unit, for contact-free detection of thread in the transport zone, generates a control or regulation signal for the thread supply and/or receiving unit(s). The novel feature is that a device for causing sideways oscillation of the thread from its path is provided along the transport zone. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a corresponding monitored <b>thread</b> <b>guiding</b> process, in which controlled transverse oscillations are induced in the thread in the transport zone, optical detection of a consequent dynamic sensor signal is used to indicate an undamaged thread and lack of detection of such a signal is used to detect a broken thread, in which case operation of the knitting machine is halted. USE - For monitored <b>guiding</b> of <b>thread</b> in a knitting machine, especially a circular knitting machine. ADVANTAGE - <b>Guiding</b> of the <b>threads</b> is effectively monitored (especially as regards thread tension) while avoiding additional wear on the knitting machine side components (including the thread itself), so {{that the need for}} expensive and time-consuming maintenance operations is eliminated. Constant thread quality is ensured, especially so that threads of low (specifically non-optically resolvable) roughness are obtained. Yarn <b>guiding</b> within several <b>thread</b> <b>guides</b> can be individually monitored, so that a higher quality knitted product is obtained.

40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Bilateral vocal cord {{paralysis}} {{in early}} childhood is a life-threatening condition, which often requires immediate intervention. One of the treatment options is a quick, reversible simple suture vocal cord lateralizing technique, whereby the arytenoid cartilage is directly lateralized to the normal abducted position. Considering pediatric laryngeal anatomy, a small endolaryngeal <b>thread</b> <b>guide</b> instrument was designed for precise suture insertion. STUDY DESIGN: New instrument validation. METHODS: Four newborns had inspiratory stridor immediately after birth; two had to be intubated. Laryngotracheoscopy revealed bilateral vocal cord paralysis. Unilateral, left-sided endoscopic arytenoid abduction lateropexy was performed with supraglottic jet ventilation on the 4 th, 5 th, 5 th, and 27 th day {{of life for the}} four patients, respectively. RESULTS: All babies remained intubated for 3 to 7 days with an uncuffed tracheal tube. After extubation, no dyspnea or swallowing disorder occurred. A subjective quality of life questionnaire, laryngotracheoscopy, clinical growth charts, and voice analysis showed satisfactory functional results. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive, quick, reversible endoscopic arytenoid abduction lateropexy might be a more favorable solution for neonatal bilateral vocal cord paralysis than earlier treatment strategies. In one step, the airway can be maintained without the risk of any permanent damage to voice production. Good swallowing function is also preserved. The specially modified endolaryngeal <b>thread</b> <b>guide</b> instrument gives a fast and effective option for creating the lateralized arytenoid position even in the technically challenging surgical context of a neonate larynx.

40|$|The {{concept of}} man’s {{individual}} rights appeared {{a long time}} ago as a means of the individual’s protection in relationship with the others. Living in a society, man interacts with other people, and these relations are regulated by certain rules.

Human’s fundamental rights are sanctioned only after being put down in the constitutions of different states, and once regional and international protection instruments are created.

40|$|In the {{symbiotic}} {{interaction between}} Azorhizobium caulinodans and Sesbania rostrata root and stem-borne nodules are formed. The bacteria enter the host via intercellular spaces at lateral or adventitious root bases and form infection pockets in outer cortical layers. Infection <b>threads</b> <b>guide</b> the bacteria to nodule primordia where plant cells are invaded. To identify bacterial functions {{that are required}} for this infection process, two mutants defective in nodulation were studied; one produced no Nod factors (nodA mutant), the other had altered surface polysaccharides (SPS) and induced the formation of pseudo-nodules, Bacteria were visualized {{with the help of}} a nodA-uidA reporter fusion that was functional during nodule development and in bacteroids. In contrast to the SPS mutant, nodA mutants were unable to colonize outer cortical regions. In mixed inoculations with both mutants, functional nodules were formed, the central tissue of which was occupied by the nodA mutant. These observations suggest that SPS play a role in deeper invasion and that Nod factors are necessary for entry. Simultaneous application of purified Nod factors and nodA mutant bacteria restored the formation of outer cortical infection pockets leading to the conclusion that intercellular infection is an active process that is dependent on bacterial Nod factor signaling...|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{activated}} chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of polycrystalline diamond films, hot-filament activation (HF-CVD) is widely used for applications where large deposition areas are needed or three-dimensional substrates have to be coated. We have developed processes for the deposition of conductive, boron-doped diamond films {{as well as for}} tribological crystalline diamond coatings on deposition areas up to 50 cm x 100 cm. Such multi-filament processes are used to produce diamond electrodes for advanced electrochemical processes or large batches of diamond-coated tools and parts, respectively. These processes demonstrate the high degree of uniformity and reproducibility of hot-filament CVD. The usability of hot-filament CVD for diamond deposition on three-dimensional substrates is well known for CVD diamond shaft tools. We also develop interior diamond coatings for drawing dies, nozzles, and <b>thread</b> <b>guides.</b> Hot-filament CVD also enables the deposition of diamond film modifications with tailored properties. In order to adjust the surface topography to specific applications, we apply processes for smooth, fine-grained or textured diamond films for cutting tools and tribological applications. Rough diamond is employed for grinding applications. Multilayers of fine-grained and coarse-grained diamond have been developed, showing increased shock resistance due to reduced crack propagation. Hot-filament CVD is also used for in situ deposition of carbide coatings and diamond–carbide composites, and the deposition of non-diamond, silicon-based films. These coatings are suitable as diffusion barriers and are also applied for adhesion and stress engineering and for semiconductor applications, respectively...|$|R
