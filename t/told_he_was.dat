He grew up with three brothers; Jimmy, Dennis, and Patrick, who all joined the Coldstream Guards; and one sister, Jackie. He {{attended}} St Mary's College as a youth. A promising athlete and gifted footballer, as a youngster he travelled to London for a trial with Crystal Palace along with John and Terry Fenwick, but was <b>told</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> too lightweight at the time. After an unsuccessful trial with Aston Villa, he became an apprentice at Chesterfield in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Bostwick {{started his}} career at Millwall, and played {{regularly}} for the club's under-18 team and reserve team. At the age of 17, he joined Conference National club Crawley Town on work experience during the latter stages of 2005–06 season. On return to Millwall, Bostwick signed a new one-year contract with the club, but {{was sent back to}} Crawley Town on loan in August 2006. Bostwick played regularly for Crawley until he was recalled by Millwall in January 2007, and was <b>told</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> surplus to requirements at the club. He subsequently signed for Rushden & Diamonds on an 18-month contract, but only played eight matches before falling out of favour at Nene Park, and was released by Rushden {{at the end of the}} 2006–07 campaign.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{appearing}} 24 {{times for}} Gateshead {{during the opening}} half of the 2012–13 season, although eight of which were as a substitute, Odubade was loaned to Conference National side Forest Green Rovers on 17 January 2013, {{for the remainder of}} the campaign. He made his debut on 19 January as a second-half substitute against Stockport County, a game in which Forest Green lost 2–1. He scored his first goal for Forest Green on 12 March 2013 in a 2–1 win over Southport. It proved to be his only goal during his time at Forest Green, making 14 appearances, all of which in the league. Odubade returned to Gateshead following the conclusion of the 2012–13 season, and was <b>told</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> one of seven players released by the club in April 2013.|$|E
5|$|Having not {{featured}} for Cardiff {{during the}} opening months of the 2010–11 season, Comminges joined League One side Carlisle United on a short-term loan deal until 31 December 2010. Carlisle manager Greg Abbott hinted {{at the possibility of}} a permanent deal, should the loan be a success. However, Comminges failed to make a league appearance during his three-month loan spell, playing just 45 minutes in a 3–2 win over Conference National side Tamworth in the FA Cup. The adverse weather conditions during his loan agreement had resulted in a spate of postponements, and Comminges returned to his parent club earlier than agreed. On returning to Cardiff, he was <b>told</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> free to find a new club with his contract expiring {{at the end of the}} season. He left the club by mutual consent, and subsequently joined League Two side Southend United on a free transfer in January 2011.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other teams}} either had similar {{knowledge}} or had pursued Bure, {{but there was}} confusion as to {{the legitimacy of the}} extra games. The Detroit Red Wings had asked league vice president Gil Stein about Bure's availability before their fifth-round pick, but were <b>told</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not eligible. They later decided to select him with their sixth-round pick, 116th overall, and settle his eligibility later. The Canucks selected Bure three picks ahead of Detroit's turn. Meanwhile, Winnipeg Jets general manager Mike Smith, claimed he made an offer to the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation that would involve three years of transfer payments before Bure would be allowed to join the Jets; however Smith did not have any plans to draft Bure in 1989 as he believed he was ineligible.|$|E

Button ran wide at the first corner on the penultimate lap of the race but continued in fifth place. Alonso maintained the lead throughout the remainder of the event and crossed the start/finish line on lap 67 to secure the 23rd victory of his Formula One career. Massa finished second 4.1 seconds behind, and was ahead of Vettel in third. Hamilton secured fourth, with teammate Button in fifth. Webber reduced his pace and managed to finish in sixth place. Kubica, Rosberg, Schumacher and Petrov rounded out the points-scoring positions. Kobayashi {{was the first of the}} non-points scorers in eleventh, followed by Barrichello and Hülkenberg. De La Rosa, Alguersuari, Liuzzi, Sutil, Glock and Senna were the last of the classified finishers.|$|E
5|$|Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion for the Court, which declined to overturn the state court's decision because fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody. Kennedy noted that there were facts for and against the claim that Alvarado was in custody. Facts pointing towards custody included that the interview took place at a police station, the interview lasted for two hours, Alvarado was not <b>told</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> free to leave, and Alvarado's parents {{were not allowed to}} be present during the interview. Facts weighing against custody included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police, Alvarado was not threatened or told he would be placed under arrest, and the interview focused on the crimes of Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes. The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody, rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision was reasonable because it was not clearly unreasonable.|$|E
5|$|Earp was {{a lifelong}} gambler {{and was always}} looking for a quick way to make money. After leaving Tombstone, Earp went to San Francisco, where he reunited with Josephine Earp. She became his common-law wife. They joined a gold rush to Eagle City, Idaho, where they owned mining {{interests}} and a saloon. They left there to race horses and open a saloon during a real estate boom in San Diego, California. Back in San Francisco, Wyatt raced horses again, but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the Fitzsimmons–Sharkey boxing match and called a foul that led many to believe that he fixed the fight. They moved briefly to Yuma, Arizona, before joining the Nome Gold Rush in 1899. In partnership with Charlie Hoxie, they opened a two-story saloon called the Dexter and made an estimated $80,000 (about $2 million in 2017 dollars). Returning to the lower 48, they opened another saloon in Tonopah, Nevada, the site of a new gold find. Around 1911, Earp began working several mining claims in Vidal, California, retiring in the hot summers with Josephine to Los Angeles. Earp made friends among early Western actors in Hollywood and tried to get his story <b>told.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> portrayed in film only once before he died, and very briefly, in the 1923 film Wild Bill Hickok.|$|E

However, after the Rams lost nine of their first ten games, coach Reddy and the entire coaching staff were sacked by the Rams' administration. Reddy was replaced by former Perth Reds coach Dean Lance and mid-season saw the arrival of goal kicking Canberra Raiders utility back Graham Appo.|$|E
