50|$|A {{reaction}} against modern American liberalism began with Barry Goldwater, {{which led to}} the eventual election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. The intellectual foundations of this conservative resurgence included the works of free-market economists Milton Friedman and the Chicago School of Economics, who argued against central economic planning (with the notable exception of the Federal Reserve), regulation of business, and Keynesian economics. Deregulation began in the mid-1970s and had broad support from both liberals and conservatives. Reagan successfully lowered marginal tax rates, most notably for those {{at the top of the}} income distribution, while his Social Security reforms raised <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> and bottom of the income distribution, leaving their total tax burden unchanged. Democratic president Bill Clinton (1993-2001) worked with conservatives, against strong liberal opposition, to end some of the main welfare programs and to implement NAFTA, linking the economies of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Clinton pushed to extend modern liberal ideals especially in the areas of health care (where he failed) and environmental protection (where he had more success).|$|R

25|$|Early on, McGuinty {{set down}} three {{strategic}} imperatives. First, no tax cuts. This ran against {{the conventional wisdom}} of politics {{that you had to}} offer tax cuts to win; everyone from Mike Harris to Bill Clinton had campaigned <b>on</b> reducing <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> burden <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> class. But McGuinty was determined that Ontario voters would accept that the money was needed to restore public health care and education services. Second, a positive tone. McGuinty wanted to avoid the typical opposition leader role of automatically opposing whatever the government announced, and instead, set the agenda with positive alternatives. While attacking your opponent was important, that would be left to caucus surrogates. Third, one big team. At the time, the Ontario Liberal Party was riven into factions. Peterson-era people distrusted more recent arrivals. Jean Chrétien supporters fought with Paul Martin supporters. McGuinty set a tone that divisions were left at the door.|$|R
40|$|The {{approach}} to addressing {{economic and social}} needs in the United States strongly favors individual and corporate charity over the establishment and enforcement {{of economic and social}} rights. This charity/justice imbalance has a severely negative impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nation's poor, who struggle with inadequate access to healthcare, housing, and nutrition, despite high overall U. S. wealth. This article suggests a two-part approach for remedying the charity/justice imbalance in the United States. First, the U. S. should eliminate the charitable tax deduction, a policy that does not effectively address economic and social needs, forces an inequitable poverty relief and <b>tax</b> burden <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> class, and lulls the nation into a false sense of complacency about its poverty crisis. Second, the U. S. should replace the deduction with ratification of <b>the</b> International Covenant <b>on</b> Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This twopart process would reverse the U. S. legacy of avoiding enforceable commitments to economic and social rights. Charity would take a step back and justice a step forward...|$|R

40|$|Tax reform ideas {{played an}} {{important}} role in the recent Presidential election.

40|$|When {{most workers}} {{look at their}} pay stubs, they {{can see that the}} Social Security payroll tax rate is 12. 4 percent [...] with the {{employee}} and employer each paying 6. 2 percent. But many workers do not know that any annual wages above $ 106, 800 are not taxed by Social Security. In other words, a worker who makes twice the Social Security wage cap [...] $ 213, 600 per year [...] pays Social Security tax on only half of his or her earnings, and one who makes just over a million dollars per year pays the tax on only about a tenth. Raising the Social Security cap [...] which would make some or all earnings above $ 106, 800 subject to the Social Security tax [...] has gotten some attention as a way to help alleviate Social Security's long-term budget shortfall. U. S. Senator Bernie Sanders plans to introduce legislation to keep the current cap at $ 106, 800, but to also apply the Social Security payroll tax to earnings over $ 250, 000. It is similar to previous bills and echoes a proposal by then-Senator Obama on the campaign trail in 2008. While this would leave those making between the current cap of $ 106, 800 and the proposed cap of $ 250, 000 paying the lowest rates, it would help secure the solvency of the program and avoid an increase in <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> To help inform this policy debate, this paper examines Census Bureau data from the most recently available American Community Survey to determine how raising the cap would affect workers based on gender, race or ethnicity, age, and state of residence...|$|E
50|$|This {{criticism}} by the MRC {{does not address}} the argument that $1.1 trillion in additional annual revenue could be generated by closing loopholes and eliminating tax expenditures. Eliminating just 19% of these tax expenditures would raise the same revenue without raising the top marginal tax rate, and eliminating income <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> all earnings below $200,000.Additionally, fewer than 30% of Americans realize that the payroll tax generates almost as much federal revenue as the income tax. Currently, all earnings above $106,000 are exempt from the payroll tax, meaning that the majority of federal <b>taxes</b> collected <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> class are collected through a regressive tax. Eliminating this exemption raises the highest effective marginal tax rate (combining both income taxes and payroll taxes) to about 48%. This is similar to the effective tax rate currently paid by small business owners with incomes below $150,000. This change, combined with the elimination of other exemptions, it is argued, allows the OneTax to remain revenue neutral despite eliminating income tax filing for more than 98% of American households.|$|R
5000|$|However, the {{argument}} {{put forward by}} Wilkinson and Taylor {{may have been more}} of a thought exercise in relative tradeoffs between aspects of economic freedoms. As written by Wilkinson in the post:The biggest problem with my particularist, data-first libertarian argument for Bernie Sanders is that Bernie Sanders doesn’t seem to actually understand that Denmark-style social democracy is funded by a free-market capitalist system that is in many ways less regulated than American capitalism. This critique had been outlined in an earlier piece by Wilkinson, in which he wrote: [...] "The lesson Bernie Sanders needs to learn is that you cannot finance a Danish-style welfare state without free markets and large <b>tax</b> increases <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> class." [...] Rhetorical exercise or not, the idea of a [...] "libertarian case for Bernie Sanders" [...] helped contribute to a debate among libertarians about ideological priors during the 2016 election cycle.

40|$|The Coalition is {{committed}} to helping Australian families to get ahead. Middle income Australians are bearing a growing tax burden. Without action, the average full time wage earner would face the second highest marginal tax rate this year and {{nearly half of all}} taxpayers would be in the top two brackets in ten years’ time. The Turnbull Government is giving hard working Australians greater incentive to earn more without being taxed more. The Government will prevent average full time wage earners from moving into the second top tax bracket until 2019 - 20 by increasing the 32. 5 per cent tax threshold from $ 80, 000 to $ 87, 000. This will stop around 500, 000 taxpayers facing the 37 per cent marginal tax rate. By pushing up <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> threshold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>tax</b> bracket we’ll keep full time average wage earners <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower rate for longer. This will reward hard working Australians for doing more overtime, picking up more shifts, taking a promotion or a better new job, without being penalised by paying more tax through the higher rate. This change also builds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> cuts provided to those on incomes of less than $ 80, 000 to compensate for the carbon tax.
