Spring and fall experience peaks of activity as <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> seasons when stronger winds, wind shear, and atmospheric instability are present. Tornadoes are focused in the right front quadrant of landfalling tropical cyclones, which tend {{to occur in the}} late summer and autumn. Tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of eyewall mesovortices, which persist until landfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. <b>Those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> kind of people who do not give up hope even {{at the edge of the}} grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E

25|$|Romanesque {{never truly}} {{ceased to be}} {{expressed}} in various ways both decorative and structural until {{as late as the}} 16th century, thus most historians name it as Resistance Romanesque, referring to a specific kind of buildings that present a very marked statement of this period even if mixed with later artistical styles (Gothic, Manueline, Renaissance). Some examples of <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Churches of Caminha, (built in the late 15th century), Torre de Moncorvo (built in the early 16th century), and the Cathedral of Viana do Castelo (also from the 15th century).|$|E

25|$|During archaeological {{excavations}} in 2012 {{the remains}} of a skeleton pierced with an iron bar in the heart were found. It is believed that <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> remains of the local nobleman Krivich (or Krivitsa), ruler of the fortress of Sozopol (castrofilax). Believed to be a very cruel person, the locals made sure that he would not come back to haunt the city after his death by piercing him with an iron bar in the chest. There are more than 100 medieval funerals similar to that of Krivitsa found all over Bulgaria. The remains were pierced with either an iron or a wooden bar through the chest {{to make sure that the}} dead will not rise from the grave as a vampire.|$|E
25|$|The sīra {{literature}} {{includes a}} variety of heterogeneous materials, containing mainly stories of military expeditions undertaken by Muhammad and his companions. These stories are intended as historical accounts and used for veneration. The sīra also includes a number of written documents, such as political treaties (e.g., Treaty of Hudaybiyyah or Constitution of Medina), military enlistments, assignments of officials, letters to foreign rulers, and so forth. It also records some of the speeches and sermons made by Muhammad, like his speech at the Farewell Pilgrimage. Some of the sīra accounts include verses of poetry commemorating certain events and battles. While {{some of which are}} considered to be of a lesser quality and lacking authenticity, the most serious of <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> ones by Hassan ibn Thabit.|$|E
25|$|Most batsmen {{prefer to}} play shots off either the front or back foot {{and this will}} {{influence}} the bowlers' choice of balls. It is difficult to play short balls off the front foot so bowlers will bowl more short balls at batsmen who prefer the front foot. Likewise, {{it is hard to}} play yorkers and full pitched balls off the back foot so <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> deliveries of choice against back foot players. If a bowler can successfully get a batsman playing off his or her less-favoured foot with a sequence of appropriately pitched balls he can then gain an element of surprise by suddenly throwing down the opposite kind of ball – a yorker after a succession of short balls or a bouncer after a succession of full balls. An unobservant or complacent batsman can easily be caught unawares and lose their wicket.|$|E

25|$|Lika and Gorski Kotar {{are marked}} by several {{significant}} rivers draining north towards the Pannonian Basin. <b>Those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Kupa, tracing the northern boundary of the region, Dobra, Mrežnica and the Koranaforming travertine barriers and waterfalls before discharging into Kupa in area of Karlovac, as well as Una, {{in the eastern part}} of the region, at the border of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore, there are losing streams such as Gacka, Krbava and Lika rivers, reflecting a high degree of karstification of the terrain in the region, resulting in increased permeability of soil and rocks. Ingress of water underground resulted in formation of subterranean watercourses and lakes. Probably the finest example of interaction of karst terrain and watercourses in the area are Plitvice Lakes16 interlinked lakes between Mala Kapela and Plješevica, through which Korana River flows. The area is abundant in travertine barriers, waterfalls and caves of biological origincreated through deposition of calcium carbonate through agency of moss, algae and aquatic bacteria. The Plitvice Lakes are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and they are a part of one of three Croatia's national parks located in the Mountainous Croatia, along with Risnjak and Sjeverni Velebit.|$|E
25|$|The IFRC {{coordinates}} {{cooperation between}} national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies {{throughout the world}} and supports the foundation of new national societies in countries where no official society exists. On the international stage, the IFRC organizes and leads relief assistance missions after emergencies such as natural disasters, manmade disasters, epidemics, mass refugee flights, and other emergencies. As per the 1997 Seville Agreement, the IFRC is the Lead Agency of the Movement in any emergency situation which does not take place {{as part of an}} armed conflict. The IFRC cooperates with the national societies of those countries affected– each called the Operating National Society (ONS)– as well as the national societies of other countries willing to offer assistance– called Participating National Societies (PNS). Among the 187 national societies admitted to the General Assembly of the International Federation as full members or observers, about 25–30 regularly work as PNS in other countries. The most active of <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> American Red Cross, the British Red Cross, the German Red Cross, and the Red Cross societies of Sweden and Norway. Another major mission of the IFRC which has gained attention in recent years is its commitment to work towards a codified, worldwide ban on the use of land mines and to bring medical, psychological, and social support for people injured by land mines.|$|E
