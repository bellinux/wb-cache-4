5|$|Meanwhile, {{after his}} release, Alfano left Naples and went from village to village to elude arrest. The Carabinieri located him in San Leucio, near Caserta, {{but he managed}} to escape. He fled to Rome, {{obtained}} a false passport and sailed for the United States from Marseilles, France. He disembarked on March 17, 1907, in New York disguised {{as a member of the}} ship's crew, posing as a stoker. In New York he began to run a gambling den in the basement of 108 Mulberry Street. He became one of the primary underworld targets of police sergeant Joseph Petrosino of the New York City Police Department, who believed Alfano <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> player in the New York branch of the Camorra.|$|E
5|$|According to a podcast {{interview}} with Chris Jericho, Copeland {{said that he}} did not initially like the idea of the ladder match and even told WWE management not to include him on the Wrestlemania 21 card altogether. However, he was talked into competing by the other participants like Jericho and Glenn Jacobs (Kane) who said the match had the potential <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> success. At Backlash, Edge defeated Chris Benoit in a Last Man Standing match to end the feud. Several weeks after, Edge was then paired with Lita, his real-life girlfriend at the time, in an angle in which she betrayed her storyline husband Kane, by costing him a number-one contender match for the World Heavyweight Championship. Edge faced even more scorn from fans due to this relationship, which lasted over a year. The next week, Edge received his World Heavyweight Championship match against Batista, which he lost. Edge started a feud with Kane leading to several matches between them including one at Vengeance, when Edge lost to Kane. After trading several victories on Raw, the feud ended in a stretcher match on the July 25 episode of Raw that Edge won, but shortly after, Kane performed a tombstone piledriver on Lita.|$|E
5|$|Jardine {{planned to}} use Verity to contain the batsmen and prevent them scoring runs, while the fast bowlers rested. However, Verity was not {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> success on the tour. The good batting conditions, the aggressive Australian approach to playing spin bowlers and Verity's lack of experience led critics to dismiss his potential contribution to the English bowling attack, but Verity had a successful start to the tour. Assisted by overnight rain, he took seven for 37, including the wicket of Don Bradman, against a Combined XI, comprising {{some of the best}} Australian players. In the following game, against South Australia, Verity took eight wickets, including five for 42 in the second innings. By now, the press had begun to pay attention to Verity's achievements, and former Australian batsman Clem Hill expressed his admiration for Verity. Selected for the first Test on the strength of his early tour performances, Verity bowled just 17overs in the game, mainly being used to give the fast bowlers a rest. He did not take any wickets and Verity himself believed he had bowled poorly. England won the match, using Bodyline tactics which had first been used earlier in the tour. After the Test, the tourists travelled to Tasmania to play two matches against the state team. Verity played in the second, and although rain interrupted play, restricting Verity to five overs, he scored his first half-century in first-class cricket. However, he was left out of the team for the second Test and was replaced by Bill Bowes. England played four fast bowlers but Jardine had misjudged the playing surface; the Australian spinners were very effective on a slow-paced pitch and Australia levelled the series.|$|E

Reynolds and Ashby were both solid in their positions and gave Houston some much needed consistency. The season started with a boost from pitcher Ken Forsch, who threw a no-hitter the Braves the second game of the season. In May 1979, New Jersey shipping tycoon Dr. John McMullen had agreed to buy the Astros. Now with an investor in charge, the Astros {{would be more likely to}} compete in the free agent market.|$|E

50|$|After a shaky start, Spence became {{comfortable}} with the Radio London format and quickly established his lunchtime show as the most popular on the station, working live for three hours a day, often in rough seas where gramophone needles skipped across vinyl records, and with blankets to deaden the echo from the steel walls of the studio. His ratings could not <b>be</b> put down <b>to</b> formatting or music choice alone, as every DJ followed a similar tight format, based on the Dallas station KLIF. It was almost unheard of for a lunchtime radio show on any station <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> draw than the breakfast show.

25|$|Kershaw pitched five {{innings and}} {{held on to the}} lead, but the Nationals {{repeatedly}} pushed him to the brink, and his frequent discussions on the mound with Dodgers catcher Yasmani Grandal incited a chorus of boos from the crowd. In the second inning, with two Nationals on base after Daniel Murphy and Ryan Zimmerman singled and Anthony Rendon reached first on a fielder's choice, Danny Espinosa – batting seventh instead of a probable eighth due to Ramos′s unavailability – struck out for the second out. A Dodgers error then allowed Severino to reach first base and load the bases, but Scherzer popped out to end the inning without the Nationals scoring a run. In the third inning, Rendon singled to drive in two runs as part of what promised <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> inning, cutting the Dodgers′ lead to 4-2, but Espinosa struck out to end the inning with two men on base. Severino doubled in the fourth and scored on a sacrifice fly by Trea Turner to reduce the Dodgers′ lead to 4–3, but in the fifth, with Jayson Werth and Rendon on base, Espinosa again struck out to end the inning. Although he provided his typically reliable defense in the field during the game, Espinosa′s strikeouts had left six men on base and brought three rallies to an end.|$|E
25|$|Following a shaky {{start to}} the 1991–92 season, Pleat took a gamble and {{arranged}} the return of Mick Harford, who joined Luton for a second spell as a player for £325,000 in mid-September 1991. Brian Stein had already returned from FC Annecy for a second spell and the pair were thus re-united as Luton's forward line. Stein scored only three goals in 39 league appearances {{over the course of}} the season, but Harford proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> success once again as he ended the year as the club's top scorer for the season with 12 goals. The loan signing of goalkeeper Steve Sutton from Nottingham Forest revived Luton for a period, but the Board refused to supply the £300,000 fee required to keep Sutton permanently. Various loan signings such as veteran forward Imre Varadi failed to galvanise the side, but come the last day, Luton still had an outside chance of avoiding relegation. Luton travelled to already-relegated Notts County knowing that they had to win their first away match of the season, and hope that Coventry lost at Aston Villa. Julian James gave Luton the lead they required, but two late goals from Rob Matthews saw County drag Luton down with them. This meant the club missed out on competing in the inaugural season of the Premier League and, with it, the larger amounts of money available through television rights.|$|E

30|$|This {{approach}} however, {{does not}} exclude {{the assistance of}} the international community or cooperation with the development agencies and NGOs that are specialized in addressing this issue. Resorting to those agencies however, should only be made in the time of distress or unforeseen natural disasters. Hence, redefining the concept of food security and adopting this purely locally based-solution against the impacts of the climate change could contribute to the development efforts and peace and stability of the region. Not doing so however, could prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> obstacle against the African development strategy and economic gains. Thus, as Mark L. Wahlqvist, John McKay, Ya-Chen Chang and Ya-Wen Chiu have asserted, “as populations increase and the full impacts of climate change are felt, competition for the scarce resources of food and water has the potential to destabilize the region and undermine the many development gains that have been achieved in recent years” (Chellaney 2011; McDonald 2010; McKay 2009)s.|$|R
