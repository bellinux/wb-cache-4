5|$|As {{they move}} around {{the city in the}} van, <b>they</b> <b>pick</b> up {{different}} men from the streets to join them. These scenes are interspersed with the scenes of Madonna singing in front of the neon screen. The video progresses like this until the intermediate verse whence Madonna is shown standing in a cage opposite to a number of men. As the bridge builds up, Madonna starts fighting with the men. She starts bending backwards and tying herself in knot like positions, while doing backflips and somersaults which defeats the men. The chorus starts again and Madonna and her dancers are shown skating in circles around a roller rink. The video ends with the close-up of Madonna in the purple leotard and fades into her silhouette.|$|E
5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. <b>They</b> <b>pick</b> out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as {{to have a better}} chance of mating. They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by a behavioral ecologist, John Alcock, showed that a large majority of the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E

Afterwards, they decide to visit the old Hardesty family homestead. Along the way, <b>they</b> <b>pick</b> up a hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) who talks about his family {{who worked at the}} old slaughterhouse. He borrows Franklin's pocket-knife and cuts himself, then takes a Polaroid picture of the others and demands money for it. When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo and slashes Franklin's arm with a straight razor. The group forces him out of the van and drive on. They stop at a gas station to refuel, but the proprietor (Jim Siedow) tells them the pumps are empty.|$|E

25|$|There {{are other}} tactics. Dippers forage {{underwater}} in fast-moving streams. Common grackles {{have been observed}} to follow farmers’ plows to glean the grubs exposed in the fresh soil. Similarly, {{on the island of}} Borneo, the Bornean ground-cuckoo will follow wild pigs and sun bears as they turn up soil while foraging in the forest. Brewer's blackbirds are often seen in parking lots, where <b>they</b> <b>pick</b> off dead insects from car grilles. Some hummingbirds are known to take prey items from spiderwebs.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} {{jury had}} {{the task of}} selecting a song from each heat which they think was the most suitable for the Eurovision Song Contest. The jury were only able to pick songs that had not passed to the final. If <b>they</b> <b>pick</b> a song which qualifies to the final through the Second Chance round, that song became ineligible for the jury's choice. The international jury were also given {{the right to vote}} during the final of the contest, becoming the 12th jury, alongside the 11 regional juries.|$|E
25|$|While {{wandering}} around New Orleans before a show with Dockstader's Minstrels, he enters a small club {{where a group}} of black jazz musicians are performing. Jolson has a revelation, that the staid repertoire of the minstrel troupe can be transformed by actually playing black music in blackface. He tells Dockstader that he wants to sing what he has just experienced: 'I heard some music tonight, something they call jazz. Some fellows just make it up as they go along. <b>They</b> <b>pick</b> it up out of the air.' After Dockstader refuses to accommodate Jolson's revolutionary concept, the narrative chronicles his climb to stardom as he allegedly injects jazz into his blackface performances … Jolson's success is built on anticipating what Americans really want. Dockstader performs the inevitable function of the guardian of the status quo, whose hidebound commitment to what is about to become obsolete reinforces the audience's sympathy with the forward-looking hero.|$|E

25|$|Another wrinkle in {{the issue}} is the unnatural {{geographic}} location of this Eastern-Time-Zoned region. In the western Indiana counties where Eastern time is observed (South Bend and Lafayette south to Terre Haute and Vincennes), around the summer solstice, the sun neither sets until after 9:20 pm, nor does it reach solar noon until almost 2:00 pm. During the winter months when standard time is observed, school buses in western regions lose a valuable hour of the sun's rays as <b>they</b> <b>pick</b> up children in the morning. Another notable observation is that schools in the Eastern Time Zone of Indiana tend to have far more 2-hour delays, mainly {{due to the fact that}} sunlight is required for many road de-icing components to work. With the sun rising as late as 8:20 am in some areas, available sunlight is inadequate to safely thaw the roads for school buses to pick up all their passengers on time. The argument is that if the same area were in its geographically natural Central time zone, the sun would be up an hour sooner, and it would have an additional hour to thaw the roads every morning.|$|E
25|$|The protagonists {{make their}} way to Firsthome and the Court, but are treated there with {{relative}} indifference. <b>They</b> <b>pick</b> up a new friend, Roofshadow, and go northwest. They are captured by a group of evil cats called the Clawguard, and taken to Vastnir, an enormous mound far to the north, where the evil cat-god Grizraz Hearteater enslaves cats to take over the world, swollen in size and sitting upon a mound of dead and dying creatures. Tailchaser needs to alert the outside world and especially the court about his evil doings. Soon, Roofshadow creates a hole from above ground, and Tailchaser manages to escape, and races to Ratleaf Forest, where he asks a clan of squirrels to alert them for him in repayment for a debt contracted with their lord's brother. He feels guilty with Pouncequick, Eatbugs, and Roofshadow trapped in Vastnir because of him. He returns to the dreadful mound, where Quiverclaw and Prince Fencewalker, whom he had met at the court, come to the rescue. Lord Hearteater creates the Fikos, a dog-like monster of terrible power, out of the mound of dying creatures he had been sitting on. Tailchaser takes advantage of the chaos to rescue Pouncequick, Eatbugs, and Roofshadow. They go through the havoc of Vastnir, and lose Eatbugs, the mad cat, on the way. Roofshadow and Pouncequick escape while Tailchaser goes back to find Eatbugs. He goes into a crevice and sees Eatbugs in a near-deathlike state, and feels dazed and confused. Upon Tailchaser's uttering a prayer to Lord Tangaloor Firefoot, Hearteater's brother, Eatbugs awakens, revealing himself to actually be Firefoot incognito. Tailchaser runs out of Vastnir at Firefoot's urging, and meets his friends, while Firefoot goes to deal with Hearteater, resulting in the destruction of Vastnir.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "cerulean speech", where Miranda {{draws the}} {{connection}} between the designer fashion in Runways pages and Andy's cerulean sweater, criticizing Andy's snobbishness about fashion and explaining the trickle-down effect, had its origins in a scene cut from earlier drafts that Streep had asked to have restored. It slowly grew from a few lines where the editor disparaged her assistant's fashion sense to a speech about [...] "why she thought fashion was important ... She is so aware that she is affecting billions of people, and what <b>they</b> <b>pick</b> off the floor and what they are putting on their bodies in the morning." [...] Streep said in 2016 she was interested in [...] "the responsibility lying on the shoulders of a woman who was the head of a global brand ...

The video also includes several special musical segments, including two songs from the film; [...] "Bad to the Bone" [...] and [...] "Guitars, Cadillacs", {{as well as a}} [...] "live" [...] video feed from Costa Rica of a performance of the song La Bamba. Mixed into the video cycle are live images of the waiting audience (in the manner of a closed-circuit security system) and two brief comical sketches of [...] "guests" [...] running afoul of Cyberdyne security – either being electrocuted by a security device or being arrested by security staff.

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} badnjak {{has been brought}} in, or {{immediately}} before in some places, an armful of straw is spread over the floor. The straw is usually brought in with the same greetings and throwing of grain as the badnjak. The person spreading it may imitate a hen clucking to call her chicks, [...] "Kvo, kvo, kvo", with the family's children imitating chicks, [...] "Piju, piju, piju", while <b>they</b> <b>pick</b> at the straw. In Čečava, northern Bosnia, the children then {{lie down on the}} straw, before closing their eyes and picking a stalk with their lips: the child that picked the longest stalk will supposedly be the luckiest in the following year. In the Bay of Kotor, the ceremony is accompanied by the words [...] "Kuda slama, tuda slava"—"Whither straw, thither celebration." [...] A common custom is to scatter a handful of walnuts over the straw. It will be collected and taken out of the house {{on the morning of the}} second day after Christmas. Some of the straw may be set aside and used in apotropaic practices in the coming year.|$|E
500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode.

[...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and <b>they</b> <b>pick</b> you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened.
