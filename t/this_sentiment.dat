5|$|The Corinthian {{order of}} {{architectural}} style originating from ancient Greece was the dominant architectural {{style in the}} age of Augustus and the imperial phase of Rome. Suetonius once commented that Rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital, yet Augustus and Agrippa set out to dismantle <b>this</b> <b>sentiment</b> by transforming the appearance of Rome upon the classical Greek model.|$|E
5|$|The Indonesian {{sociologist}} Umar Kayam, who {{had served}} on the Jakarta Art Council with Djajakusuma, described the director as highly disciplined. Biran described him as having a fiery temper which could be triggered suddenly, yet quick to calm when the trigger was removed; <b>this</b> <b>sentiment</b> was echoed by several people {{who had worked with}} Djajakusuma. Coverage in the film magazine Djaja described him as hardworking and highly dedicated to his craft, to the point of forsaking romantic relationships.|$|E
5|$|Lewis {{argues that}} Applewhite {{effectively}} controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes <b>this</b> <b>sentiment,</b> arguing {{that members of}} the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because they saw {{it as a way to}} demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.|$|E

5|$|Opposition to Chicago's skyscrapers {{began to}} grow during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Even before the {{development}} of the skyscraper, some criticized large buildings in Chicago for dominating churches and private houses, and <b>this</b> <b>sentiment</b> strengthened. Critics complained that the concentration of tall buildings {{in the center of the}} city was causing huge congestion, and each new skyscraper was also burning additional coal to power its facilities, together consuming a total of over one million tons each year, leaving smoke and stagnant air hanging over Chicago. Many were concerned over the risk of a major fire breaking out and spreading, uncontrolled, from building to building.|$|E
5|$|The {{permissive}} attitude toward business {{did not always}} extend toward large corporations. A lack of venture capital in the state became a significant problem with the early industry. Civic and business leaders, and even ordinary citizens, worried that the influx of capital from outside the state {{would lead to a}} loss of political power, revenue, and business opportunities. <b>This</b> <b>sentiment</b> led to a series of antitrust lawsuits by the state Attorney General starting in 1906. The lawsuits easily succeeded and limited the ability of outside investors, most notably Standard Oil, to gain control of the state oil companies.|$|E
5|$|In Georgian literature, Tamar {{was also}} romanticized, but very {{differently}} from the Russian and Western European view. The Georgian romanticists followed a medieval tradition in Tamar's portrayal as a gentle, saintly woman who ruled a country permanently at war. <b>This</b> <b>sentiment</b> was further inspired by the rediscovery of a contemporary, 13th-century wall painting of Tamar in the then-ruined Betania monastery, which was uncovered and restored by Prince Grigory Gagarin in the 1840s. The fresco became a source of numerous engravings circulating in Georgia {{at that time and}} inspired the poet Grigol Orbeliani to dedicate a romantic poem to it. Furthermore, the Georgian literati, reacting to Russian rule in Georgia and the suppression of national institutions, contrasted Tamar's era to their contemporary situation, lamenting the irretrievably lost past in their writings. Hence, Tamar became a personification of the heyday of Georgia, a perception that has persisted down to the present time.|$|E
50|$|Grounds for {{overturning}} a precedent—Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken {{presents a}} direct contradiction to the Supreme Court decision in Buck v. Jewell-LaSalle Realty Co., which {{held that a}} hotel proprietor who made broadcast music available to his hotel guests did violate the Copyright Act of 1964. Due to this inconsistency, the Supreme Court called upon the legislature to clarify what constitutes a performance and what does not. Both majority and dissenting opinions expressed <b>this</b> <b>sentiments</b> involving the need for clarification by Congress on this issue.|$|R

2500|$|Anti-Irish {{prejudice}} rose {{when the}} Irish {{migrated to the}} mostly-Protestant Great Britain during the 19th century famine. The predominant factor triggering <b>this</b> anti-Irish <b>sentiment</b> was that the migrants were predominantly Catholic.|$|R
5|$|The economy {{continued}} in muted form. The three main establishment families on the island, the Moodys, the Sealys, and Kempners, had essentially unrivalled {{control of the}} island. The Splash Day celebrations restarted, drawing tourists to the coast. Many hotels, banks, and some insurance companies remained as did the medical and nursing schools, {{as well as the}} hospitals. Efforts at historical preservation (notably including those of George P. Mitchell) gradually helped to re-establish the island's tourism industry, though in a very different form from the past. Nonbinding referenda were put forward in the 1980s regarding legalization of casinos in the city but were defeated by the voters each time, demonstrating the changes in the city since the bygone era. However informal polls in 2008 and 2010 indicate <b>this</b> <b>sentiment</b> may be changing. Indeed gambling aboard cruise ships leaving from Galveston is now commonplace.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of 4 consists of mid-tempo pieces, {{but unlike the}} filler that might have occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in this realm. Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while {{not be easy to}} grind to, still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé reminds us that a party is not only meant for dancing. It is a place where you go to enjoy the company of others and oftentimes, that involves real human conversation and interaction. Echoing <b>this</b> <b>sentiment,</b> André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast. 'Party' like much of 4, is a conversation, and André 3000 wants to be heard.|$|E
5|$|Writing for PC Gamer, Leif Johnson complimented {{the variety}} of {{multiplayer}} game modes available. <b>This</b> <b>sentiment</b> was shared by other reviewers who thought the multiplayer offering was considerably more diverse than what was typically available in most RTS games. Numerous critics regarded Blitz to be the standout multiplayer mode, however they were still apprehensive about its shortcomings. GamesRadar reviewer Robert Zak called Blitz the most forward-thinking area of Halo Wars 2, in contrast {{to other parts of}} the game which he thought were formulaic. Other writers agreed that the mode was an interesting twist on RTS and enjoyed playing it. While Blitz card packs could be earned through playing the game, both Bratt and Rignall still expressed disappointment about the inclusion of microtransactions for purchasing card packs. Johnson and Stapleton suspected that winning games in Blitz may be too reliant on the luck of the draw. Consequently, Stapleton thought the mode was unsuitable for competitive multiplayer but felt that the randomness and card mechanics worked well in the Firefight variant.|$|E

5|$|The {{events of}} 1848 in Europe {{and in the}} Austrian Empire {{represent}} a watershed in Croatian society and politics, given their linkage to the Croatian national revival that strongly influenced and significantly shaped political and social events in Croatia from that point onwards {{to the end of}} the 20th century. At the time, the Sabor advocated the implicit severance of ties with the Kingdom of Hungary, emphasizing links to other South Slavic lands within the empire. A period of neo-absolutism was followed by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and Croatian–Hungarian Settlement, recognizing the limited independence of Croatia, together with reinvigorated claims of uninterrupted Croatian statehood. Two political parties that evolved in the 1860s and contributed significantly to <b>this</b> <b>sentiment</b> were the Party of Rights (1861–1929) and the People's Party. They were opposed by the National Constitutional Party that was in power for most of the period between the 1860s and 1918, which advocated closer ties between Croatia and Hungary. Another significant party formed in this era was the Serb People's Independent Party, which would later form the Croat-Serb Coalition with the Party of Rights and other Croat and Serb parties. This Coalition ruled Croatia between 1903 and 1918. The Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), established in 1904 and led by Stjepan Radić, advocated Croatian autonomy but achieved only moderate gains by 1918. In the Kingdom of Dalmatia, two major parties were the People's Party, a branch of the People's Party active in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, and the Autonomist Party, which advocated maintaining the autonomy of Dalmatia, opposing the People's Party's demands for unifying Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia. The Autonomist Party was also linked to Italian irredentism. By the 1900s, the Party of Rights also made electoral gains in Dalmatia. In Dalmatia, the Autonomists won the first three elections held there in 1861, 1864 and 1867, while those from 1870 to 1908 were won by the People's Party. In 1861–1918 there were 17 elections in Croatia-Slavonia and 10 in Dalmatia.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>sentiment</b> was {{in large}} {{part due to the}} fact that Jurchens were descended from Mohe people, who were once {{subjects}} of Korean kingdoms of Goguryeo and Balhae. In addition, Jurchens were widely recognized as barbarians, as Jurchen tribes have been raiding and pillaging the northern border regions of Korean Goryeo and Joseon kingdoms for centuries. <b>This</b> <b>sentiment</b> did not disappear even after Qing completed sinicization.|$|E

25|$|Weapons of Choice {{has been}} both hailed and criticized {{by members of the}} {{alternative}} history community.

25|$|The devastation {{caused by}} Hurricane Katrina in late 2005 caused {{a few people}} to {{question}} {{the future of the}} city's Mardi Gras celebrations.

25|$|Many Canadians {{did not yet}} share <b>this</b> <b>sentiment.</b> Shortly {{before the}} {{official}} flag raising on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on 15 February 1965 (February 15 was declared National Flag of Canada Day in 1996), Stanley received an anonymous death threat. Unperturbed, he attended the ceremony in a colourful and quintessentially Canadian Hudson's Bay coat, which stood out dramatically {{in a sea of}} dark formal attire worn by the other dignitaries.|$|E
25|$|Common {{opinion of}} the mass disk {{distribution}} is also reflected in some popular media. For example, in episode 120 ("Tiki Lounge") of Malcolm in the Middle, Malcolm complains that the booster club auction items are all embarrassingly worthless. One {{of the items in}} the auction is an AOL startup disk. <b>This</b> <b>sentiment</b> is also recorded in Urban Dictionary, where listed uses for the disks include flying disks, pizza cutters, sun catchers, and microwave fodder.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} {{is that the}} Western Rite is inherently divisive. Following different liturgical traditions than their neighboring Byzantine Rite Orthodox Christians, those using the Western Rite do not share liturgical unity with them and present an unfamiliar face {{to the majority of}} Orthodox Christians. <b>This</b> <b>sentiment</b> is expressed most famously by Metropolitan Kallistos Ware, who was particularly concerned about the further fragmentation of Orthodoxy in non-Orthodox countries, in this case in Britain.|$|E
