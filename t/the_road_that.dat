5|$|Mississippi Highway 454 (MS 454) is a {{state highway}} in western Mississippi. MS 454 starts at U.S. Highway 82 (US 82) and US 278. It travels eastward to its eastern {{terminus}} at MS 1. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> became MS 454 was constructed in 1940 and opened the next year. MS 454 was designated in 1953, and has not changed significantly since.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> became Route 75 {{has existed}} since 1926, {{as part of}} Route 55 from south of Charleston to east of East Prairie. The route was renumbered to Route 77 in 1959, and it was rerouted in 1968. The {{realignment}} replaced Route E with Route 77, and its old alignment became part of Route 88 and Route 105. The section that traveled through Anniston was renumbered to Route 75.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> {{currently}} {{carries the}} SR-202 designation has existed since 1937, when it connected US-40 and US-50 along the Garfield Cut-Off Road. The Utah State Legislature designated the road SR-202 in 1969, thus taking responsibility {{of maintaining the}} road from the county. No changes or alterations have been made to SR-202, except for the legal definition of the road, which has changed twice since it was formed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> is now SR 46 {{was built}} and {{improved}} during the 1920s and was fully paved by 1930. The majority of SR 46 was originally designated as U.S. Route 466; however, after {{the latter was}} entirely removed from the U.S. Highway system, the eastern portion of the route became SR 46.|$|E
5|$|Two other roads {{have been}} {{designated}} Utah State Route 202 in the past. From 1939 to 1953, {{the name was}} used by <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> formed the eastern approach to Mercur, Utah and later became part of SR-73. From 1961 to 1967, the name was used by Main Street between SR-201 (2100 South) and SR-171 in downtown Salt Lake City, which {{is now part of}} Utah State Route 186.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1976, Bob Lewis, an {{environmental}} activist in Aspen, organized revegetation efforts on some {{sections of the}} pass near <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> were having serious erosion problems. He realized eventually that a dedicated nonprofit organization {{would be a better}} way to address the many issues that remained. The Independence Pass Foundation (IPF) was established in 1989. Its first project, coordinated with the Forest Service, CDOT and Pitkin County, was the reconstruction of a curve near the popular Weller Lake trailhead.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{something}} unexpected happened: a roadblock on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> {{had to be}} used by the brigade had to be dismantled. Zero hour was once more modified and set at midnight. At last, the troops fought battle between 2 am and 5 am but with no benefit of cover. The attackers were rapidly discovered, depriving the Israelis of the surprise effect. The battle started at 4am. The Israeli forces were submitted to a strong fire. The artillery tried to intervene but felt rapidly out of ammunition or was not within range to provide a counter-battery fire.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's brigade {{departed}} on {{the same}} road it used to enter Wytheville, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> leads to Tazewell Courthouse (Jeffersonville). It was a good decision to leave, because the Confederate army had already begun an attempt to block their return home. One of the two main roads available for the return trip was occupied by troops {{under the command of}} Colonel John McCausland, and the other road was blocked by the command of Brigadier-General John S. Williams. Two cavalry units were in pursuit, including Major May's cavalry that had harassed the brigade as it approached Wytheville.|$|E

5|$|Lajjun is {{situated}} on an elevated hill with {{an altitude of}} 150 meters above sea level, located on the southwestern edge of the Jezreel Valley (Marj ibn Amer). The village is located on both the banks of Wadi al-Lajjun, with Jenin and the entire valley visible from it. It is bordered by Tall al-Mutsallem to the northeast, and by Tall al-Asmar to the northwest. Lajjun, which was linked by secondary roads to the Jenin-Haifa road, and <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> led southwest {{to the town of}} Umm al-Fahm, laid close to the junctions of the two highways. The main spring that supplied the village with water was Ayn al-Hajja.|$|E
5|$|The 10,356 {{capacity}} all-seater {{stadium is}} in the Bury Park area of Luton, and named after <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> runs along one end of it, although the official address of the club is 1 Maple Road. Opposite the eponymous Kenilworth Stand is the Oak Road End, which has evolved from a stand first used exclusively by Luton supporters, then later by away supporters, and now used by both except in times of high ticket demand from away clubs. The Main Stand is flanked by the David Preece Stand, and opposite them stands a row of executive boxes. These boxes replaced the Bobbers Stand in 1986, as the club sought to maximise income.|$|E
5|$|The Campo road {{served as}} a wagon road {{providing}} access to eastern San Diego County as well as Imperial County. The road {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1933, and signs for Route94 were posted along local roads later that decade. Efforts to convert the western half of the route to a freeway got underway in the 1950s, and the freeway was complete by 1962 west of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> became SR125. Construction continued east to Avocado Road over the next few years. Various proposals for widening the highway have come from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), but local opposition resulted in the delay or cancellation of many of these proposals.|$|E

5|$|The Custer Trail, {{named for}} General George Armstrong Custer, {{was created in}} 1917 along a series of roads between Grand Rapids and Ft. Wayne, Indiana that {{included}} the modern M-37. Custer commanded the Michigan Cavalry Bridge during the Civil War, and he was wildly popular in the state after the war. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> bears his name never achieved that level of popularity. By 1930, the name had already fallen out of use.|$|E
5|$|The {{expressway}} crosses Taylor-Massey Creek and the East Don River, {{and climbs}} out of the valley, swinging northwards toward Eglinton Avenue. In this section, the DVP passes around the apartment buildings of Flemingdon Park. The lanes split again before the underpass at Spanbridge Road, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> connects a three-tower complex of apartments to the east of the parkway with Flemingdon Park to the west. The lanes pass beneath the Gatineau Hydro Corridor and reconnect south of the Eglinton interchange.|$|E
5|$|The {{hamlet of}} Port Kent and the {{connecting}} road were originally built in 1823. The village was planned {{to act as}} a source of labor for iron manufacturing and to provide for the industrial needs of Essex County. The hamlet grew and eventually became connected to Burlington, Vermont, via an hour-long ferry across Lake Champlain. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> accessed Port Kent originally began in Keeseville, but became part of the longer Port Kent and Hopkinton Turnpike in the 1830s. The highway that is now NY373 was also designated as part of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway in 1919.|$|E

5|$|The name of {{the road}} matches its winding route, but {{actually}} derives from the emblem of the Snake Inn, {{one of the few}} buildings on the high stretch of road. In turn, the pub's name and sign were derived from the serpent on the Cavendish arms of William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire. In the early 21st century, the inn was renamed the Snake Pass Inn, such that the inn now refers to <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> referred to itself.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> became SR28 was paved around 1932, and {{has been}} used for flumes in the timber {{industry}} since 1880. The route first appeared in 1948, with the same general alignment as it has today. The highway gained fame for many years as the location of the Ponderosa Ranch, filming location of the television series Bonanza. On June 7, 1994, the Nevada Department of Transportation(NDOT) designated SR28 as a scenic byway, named North Shore Road. Later in September 1996, SR28 and part of US50 was designated as Lake Tahoe - Eastshore Drive, a National Scenic Byway.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> {{extended}} from US101 in Oceanside {{all the way}} to SR79 near Lake Henshaw was originally added to the state highway system in 1933, but was not designated as legislative Route195 until 1935. By 1936, US395 was signed along what would become SR76 through Bonsall, as part of the route in between Elsinore and San Diego. In 1943, work began on widening the approaches to the Bonsall bridge. US395 had been shifted east away from Bonsall by 1949. SR76 was signed by 1954. During the 1964 state highway renumbering, Route195 was legally redesignated as State Route 76; at that time, the legal definition was updated to reflect the new designation of I-5, replacing US 101.|$|E
