5|$|Malvern {{had already}} become an {{overspill}} for the nearby city of Worcester, {{and the new}} motorways constructed in the early 1960s brought the industrial Midlands within commuting distance by car. With this development came the construction of large private housing developments.

5|$|After {{signing the}} truce, Muhammad {{assembled}} an expedition against the Jewish oasis of Khaybar, {{known as the}} Battle of Khaybar. This was possibly due <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> the Banu Nadir who were inciting hostilities against Muhammad, or to regain prestige from what appeared as the inconclusive result of the truce of Hudaybiyya. According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad also sent letters to many rulers, asking them to convert to Islam (the exact date is given variously in the sources). He sent messengers (with letters) to Heraclius of the Byzantine Empire (the eastern Roman Empire), Khosrau of Persia, the chief of Yemen and to some others.

5|$|Nasser made Egypt fully {{independent}} of British influence, {{and the country}} became a major power {{in the developing world}} under his leadership.

By the end of his presidency, employment and working conditions improved considerably, although poverty was still high in the country and substantial resources allocated for social welfare had been diverted to the war effort.|$|E
5|$|On December3, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, {{upgraded}} {{a tropical}} disturbance, located {{to the west}} of the Solomon Islands, to Tropical Depression 04F. On December5, as the depression moved towards the west into the Fijian archipelago, both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and RSMC Nadi upgraded it to Cyclone Daman. On December7 the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 185km/h, (115mph 10-minute sustained) which made Daman a Category 4 cyclone on the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale.

Daman then weakened the next day into a tropical depression and dissipated on December10.|$|E

The building was designed by a local architectural firm, William Lim Associates, which adopted a postmodern pluralist approach, expressed through a multiplicity of materials and forms.|$|E
5|$|Some Black Hebrews renounced their American {{citizenship}} {{to try to}} prevent more deportations.

The Black Hebrews reclaimed their American citizenship and have received aid from the U.S. government, which helped them build a school and additional housing.

5|$|There {{have been}} {{increasing}} attempts to preserve {{much of what}} survives from Scotland's architectural heritage, including the great buildings and monuments, and the classically influenced houses of towns such as Edinburgh and Glasgow. There have also been attempts at preserving the surviving Glasgow tenements, {{many of which have}} been renovated, restored to their original pink and honeyed sandstone from the black fronts created by pollution and brought up to modern standards of accommodation. Urban regeneration has also been attempted in areas of post-industrial decline, such as the Merchant City in Glasgow, which was returned <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> from the 1980s, with warehouse loft conversions and more recently the waterfront in Edinburgh, resulting in a return of resident populations to major urban centres.|$|E
5|$|A leat runs to {{the east}} of the town's main street but it is {{uncertain}} when it was first constructed. By the early seventeenth century, {{the southern end of the}} leat and one mill are shown on a map. There were three main mills: Higher Mill, Lower Mill and Middle Mill. Higher Mill appears to have always been a corn mill and it continued to produce animal feed until 1974. It has since been converted <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> but a water turbine remains. Middle Mill was used as a woollen mill in the nineteenth century and was also associated with Bilbie's bell foundry (see below). Around 1900, the mill was steam powered and had a boiler delivered. It is labelled as an axle works on the 1904 Second Edition Ordnance Survey map. The only remains of Middle Mill are some walls and a chimney base. Lower Mill ceased working in 1968. The building is now in residential use but the sluices (made by Stenner and Gunn of the Lowman Ironworks, Tiverton) can still be seen, as can the water wheel and gearing.|$|E

The Hlaingthaya industrial zone was hardest hit, with five factories destroyed and dozens of homes having their roof torn off. Locals, however, claimed that the damage was more severe than reported by the government. Cars were reportedly tossed into the air during the storm. Two people were killed and fourteen others were injured in Hlaingthaya. The winds also downed numerous power lines, leaving many without electricity. In Labutta Township, near the southern tip of the Delta, 88homes were destroyed. In the Hinthada District, torrential rains caused flash flooding that killed 18people and left 14others missing.|$|E
