5|$|The {{participants}} in the programme are four trans women and three trans men {{from different parts of}} the British Isles. They range in age from 22 to 52; five of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> under 30.|$|E
5|$|In this test, {{a number}} of cards are {{presented}} to the participants. The figures on the cards differ with respect to color, quantity, and shape. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> then given a pile of additional cards and are asked to match each one {{to one of the}} previous cards. Typically, children between ages nine and eleven demonstrate the cognitive flexibility needed for this test.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> ranked {{based on}} their {{individual}} scores. Medals are awarded to the highest ranked participants; slightly {{fewer than half of}} them receive a medal. The cutoffs (minimum scores required to receive a gold, silver or bronze medal respectively) are then chosen so that the numbers of gold, silver and bronze medals awarded are approximately in the ratios 1:2:3. Participants who do not win a medal but who score seven points on at least one problem receive an honorable mention.|$|E
50|$|During a whispered speech test, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> {{asked to}} cover the opening of one ear with a finger. The tester will then step back 1 to 2 feet behind <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> and say a series of words in a soft whisper. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> then asked to repeat what <b>is</b> heard. If <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> unable to {{distinguish}} the word, the tester will speak progressively louder until <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> able {{to understand what is}} being said. The other ear is then tested.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> mean <b>participant</b> age <b>was</b> {{approximately}} 66.9 (SD[*]=[*] 7.74) years. Demographic {{information was}} also collected {{to know that}} all <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> unrelated Caucasian men. Due to the characteristics of this pathology, all of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> men.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> {{asked to}} read a series of related word-reading and color-naming trials. In the first {{component}} of the task, known as the word-reading condition of <b>the</b> task, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> {{asked to read}} {{as quickly as possible}} a series of color names printed either in white or other various colors. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> then asked to name the color of a series of colored blocks.|$|R
5|$|The film {{is mostly}} in English, {{but also has}} some subtitled Yiddish and Hebrew. The film follows the lives of several gay and lesbian Orthodox Jews and {{includes}} interviews with rabbis and psychotherapists about Orthodox attitudes towards homosexuality. During the film's six-year production, DuBowski met hundreds of homosexual Jews, but only a handful agreed to be filmed due to fear of being ostracized from their communities. Many people who agreed to be interviewed are shown only in silhouette or with their faces pixelized. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> American Jews, with one British and one Israeli Jew also featured. The film was successful at the box office, grossing over $788,896 on eight screens by its close date.|$|E
5|$|When {{applied to}} human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of {{participants}} having varying phenotypes {{for a particular}} trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without (controls), {{or they may be}} people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said {{to be associated with the}} disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to mark a region of the human genome that may influence the risk of disease.|$|E
5|$|With {{effect from}} 1 September 2008, under the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) Order 2008 ("2008 PEMA Order"), {{responsibility}} for registering people wishing to speak or stage an exhibition or performance at Speakers' Corner {{was taken over}} from the police by the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation by way of {{an amendment to the}} Parks and Trees Regulations. To provide greater convenience, the National Parks Board made it possible for people to register online at its website. In addition, it became possible to hold demonstrations provided that they are organized by Singapore citizens and <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> only citizens and permanent residents. As the time period restriction was lifted, events can now be held around the clock. In addition, rules on voice amplification were revised to allow the use of self-powered amplification devices like loudhailers from 9:00a.m. to 10:30p.m. This relaxation of the rules potentially allows for speakers' messages to be heard by larger audiences. A minor change was also introduced to the conditions for the use of Speakers' Corner – no banner, film, photograph, placard or poster containing any violent, lewd or obscene material may be displayed or exhibited whether before, during or after the event.|$|E
30|$|This {{categorization}} {{was supported}} by the way <b>the</b> research <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> assigned to treatment and control groups, as defined by Shadish et al. (2002). During the coding process, two main categories emerged: (a) randomized, where <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> randomly selected and assigned to the treatment or control group, and (b) quasi-experimental, where <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> assigned by <b>the</b> researchers.|$|R
3000|$|... “b 1, b 2, b 3, and b 4 ” codes. Used {{to specify}} the beacon at which <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> {{deprived}} of vision. They indicate the distance where <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> blindfolded: 150, 125, 100, and 75 m respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{washed and}} anointed, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> dressed in <b>the</b> temple garment, a {{religious}} undergarment which <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> instructed to wear throughout {{his or her}} life. (Since 2005, <b>participants</b> in <b>the</b> LDS Church version of the ritual already come clothed in this garment prior to the washing and anointing.) Finally, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> given a [...] "new name" [...] {{which he or she}} is instructed never to reveal except under certain conditions in the temple.|$|R
25|$|Social-communicative aspects: <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> {{farmers and}} non-farmers. With their {{participation}} {{awareness of the}} problems of land use is raised also within unrelated to agriculture.|$|E
25|$|The Baseball Beanpot, {{an annual}} rivalry tournament {{which began in}} 1989. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> {{the same as in}} the hockey Beanpot, except that Boston University, which has no {{baseball}} program, is replaced by UMass.|$|E
25|$|Kinesthetic factors: This {{category}} {{deals with}} how closely <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> to touching, from being completely outside of body-contact distance {{to being in}} physical contact, which {{parts of the body}} are in contact, and body part positioning.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> asked non-personally {{identifiable}} information including age; their gender; {{whether they}} live alone {{and if they}} live alone. In {{order to keep the}} results anonymous, <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> not asked their name, address or anything else that could identify them.|$|R
30|$|Participants {{needed to}} use Handpad to {{complete}} two tasks. Task A was browsing a film database {{and searching for}} films to watch. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> asked to browse through a film database website to search for films to watch. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> able to choose the film database website. During this task, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> could read synopses, watch short trailers, and get more information about films. Task B was browsing one or several news websites to read news for 10  min. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> asked to browse one or several news websites and read news for 10  min. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> first asked which websites they preferred to browse (if any) and were then presented with a web browser with the desired web pages opened in various tabs (or windows, depending on user preference).|$|R
5000|$|Session two: Then <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> {{going through}} similar session as session one. The only {{difference}} <b>was</b> that for <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in <b>the</b> smoking cue {{were asked to}} express their minimum price to delay smoking before and after removing the plastic cover off <b>the</b> tray. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> also informed {{that there will be}} a 50% chance that <b>the</b> compensation <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> expressed will <b>be</b> taken into consideration for their real compensation given at the end of the study. In <b>the</b> end, all <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> rewarded five dollars for their participation.|$|R
25|$|In 2013 the {{university}} hosted the inaugural SEC Symposium in Atlanta. The topic is the Southeast's {{impact on the}} future of renewable energy, and <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> the 14 universities of the SEC, as supported by its new academic initiative, SECU.|$|E
25|$|The UMNSVP team is {{composed}} mainly of undergraduate {{students from the}} Twin Cities Campus of the University of Minnesota. Most of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> studying some sort of engineering in the University's College of Science and Engineering, but students of any major are welcome to join the team. The team is usually composed of 40 to 60 students.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> {{included}} in the research as a group, and not as individuals - hence, an umpukan, or natural cluster, is required {{to serve as the}} participants, per se. The researcher is introduced to a natural cluster by a tulay (bridge), who {{is a part of the}} umpukan and is a well-respected man in the community.|$|E
30|$|The {{instructions}} {{given to}} <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> {{similar to those}} for the lexical decision task. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> to judge whether the phrase was ambiguous and to press “Q” on the keyboard with the left hand if so or “P” {{with his right hand}} if not. In front of these letters were marks indicating what <b>the</b> keys meant. <b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> instructed to react as quickly as possible.|$|R
50|$|In November 2016, <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> announced.|$|R
30|$|Similar {{instructions}} were given for Part D, {{with the exception}} that <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> instructed {{to draw a line}} from an angle figure pair to a curve figure pair and so on. Mistakes made by <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> corrected, as with the TMT Parts A and B.|$|R
25|$|Most, but not all, of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> post-menopausal {{women and}} the older women are {{the leaders of the}} most {{challenging}} behaviors. Post-menopausal women are of key importance because they are believed not to be vulnerable to witchcraft which may take away their fertility, because they have esteem in their communities, and because they have more time for activities.|$|E
25|$|It {{proved to}} be immensely popular, drawing not only viewership, but genuine affection from the public for the young idealistic contenders. Pride also arises for the regions where <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> from, like pride was felt by many from the Acadian people when Wilfred Le Bouthillier, from Acadia, was chosen for the {{competition}} and later crowned winner of the first, 2003 edition.|$|E
25|$|Just as Jane Goodall studied {{chimpanzee}} {{social and}} family life by careful observation of chimpanzee behavior in the field, psychologists conduct naturalistic observation of ongoing human social, professional, {{and family life}}. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> aware they are being observed, and other times the participants do not know they are being observed. Strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> Club América, Everton and Pachuca.|$|R
5000|$|For knockouts, a ten-count {{similar to}} boxing and kickboxing <b>is</b> used. If <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> unable {{to answer the}} ten-count, it is {{declared}} a TKO and that fighter has lost the match. However, if <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> able to answer the ten-count, the fight resumes and one point is deducted.|$|R
30|$|The test {{requires}} <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> {{to reach}} forward beyond {{the length of}} his/her arm without loss of balance. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> on two legs, positioned shoulder width apart (or seated if <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> could not stand). <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> requested to lift one arm up to 90 °, forward flexion and extend fingers. Test-retest reliability and validity was established in a previous study (Duncan et al. 1990).|$|R
25|$|LGBT {{members of}} the church are {{expected}} to keep the law of chastity. If they do, they can “go forward as do all other {{members of the}} church.” If they desire to enter into a heterosexual marriage, they should first learn to deal with their homosexual feelings; otherwise, they must remain celibate. Gay or lesbian sex, in any form, whether <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> married or not, may be grounds for excommunication.|$|E
25|$|Buddy {{breathing}} is discouraged by many training agencies because other more reliable techniques and equipment exist. The technique needs training and regular practice by both divers {{if it is}} to be used successfully in a crisis; panic and task loading being the main reasons for it failing. Especially in situations in which one or both of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> not well-trained in the technique, the procedure has been criticised for endangering two people instead of one.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{a process}} of {{informed}} consent {{is often used to}} make sure that volunteers know what will happen in the experiment and understand that they are allowed to quit the experiment at any time. A debriefing is typically done at the experiment's conclusion in order to reveal any deceptions used and generally make sure that <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> unharmed by the procedures. Today, most research in social psychology involves no more risk of harm than can be expected from routine psychological testing or normal daily activities.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>participant</b> should <b>be</b> {{a female}} {{over the age}} of 18  years without the history of mammary gland excision. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> shouldn’t <b>be</b> {{pregnant}} confirmed by negative urine pregnancy test. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> presents with suspicious breast clinical symptoms and/or previous breast findings classified BI-RADS ≥  3 on mammography and/or ultrasound. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> willing to have all imaging procedures completed (MRI, CESM) within a 3 -week interval.|$|R
50|$|The {{executor}} in a transitive sentence always {{precedes the}} experiencer. However, when an event is proceeded by a lone <b>participant,</b> <b>the</b> semantic {{content of the}} event determines whether <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> an executor or an experiencer. This can only be determined syntactically if <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> marked by <b>the</b> preposition ʔuł-, which marks the experience.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> {{seated at}} a table in front of a laptop {{computer}} with a 15.4 -inch screen. They were randomly assigned to either the action gesture or the structure gesture condition. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> then told: “Today, your job is to watch a video of how a four-stroke engine works four times in a row and explain the concept in the video to a peer coming later. However, since you are not directly explaining a concept, your explanation will be videotaped and showed later either to him or her. He or she will learn about the concept from your explanation.” <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> not allowed to take notes or to pause or stop the video. The experimenter left the room while <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> watched <b>the</b> video. After watching the video four times, <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> given <b>the</b> verbal knowledge test and the diagramming task, and then made a video explaining the system to a peer. The video camera <b>was</b> set opposite <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> 3 m away. <b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> allowed to spend as much time as they wanted carrying out this task.|$|R
