2500|$|Forerunners {{of modern}} horizontal-axis {{utility-scale}} wind generators were the WIME-3D in service in Balaklava USSR from 1931 until 1942, a 100-kW generator on a 30-m (100-ft) tower, [...] the Smith-Putnam wind turbine built in 1941 {{on the mountain}} known as Grandpa's Knob in Castleton, Vermont, United States of 1.25 MW and the NASA wind turbines developed from 1974 through the mid-1980s. The development of these 13 experimental wind turbines pioneered many of the wind turbine design technologies in use today, including: steel <b>tube</b> <b>towers,</b> variable-speed generators, composite blade materials, and partial-span pitch control, as well as aerodynamic, structural, and acoustic engineering design capabilities. [...] The modern wind power industry began in 1979 with the serial production of wind turbines by Danish manufacturers Kuriant, Vestas, Nordtank, and Bonus. These early turbines were small by today's standards, with capacities of 20–30kW each. Since then, commercial turbines have increased greatly in size, with the Enercon E-126 capable of delivering up to 7 MW, while wind turbine production has expanded to many countries.|$|R

40|$|Instability damage {{may occur}} in {{some members of}} the {{transmission}} tower subjected to the downburst, and eventually the damage accumulation may further lead to the failure of the tower. Therefore, it is extremely essential to identify and repair the damaged major vertical members in tower body timely. The relationship surface of instable member among axial compression force, bending moment at the end and axial stiffness is determined. The results show that the axial stiffness of the instability members reduces to zero gradually. Accordingly, a two-step detection method of the major vertical member instability damage is presented. The first step detection is used to find the possible buckling damaged regions by using wavelet packet energy curvature change rate index. The second step is used to identify location of buckling damaged major member that appears in the possible damaged subregions based on the theory of modal strain energy and interval estimation. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a realistic transmission tower and experimental verified with a steel <b>tube</b> <b>tower.</b> The results indicate that the two-step detection method is effective and feasible.

40|$|As {{fluidized}} beds {{can result}} in {{an order of magnitude}} increase in the heat transfer coefficinet for a surface, they can potentially be coupled with dry cooling towers for power plant heat rejection. On such a large scale, economic considerations necessitate the use of an inexpensive particle and shallow bed depths. Existing heat transfer mechanism models for fluidized beds are discussed, and a new model presented. Heat transfer coefficients from a horizontal tube in a row of dummy tubes to a shallow fluidized bed were experimentally measured. Coefficients from banks of horizontal tubes are lower than coefficients from vertical walls primarily because of particle stagnation on the tube tops and particle recirculation problems. Experimentally, different tube and distributer geometries were tried in order to reduce stagnations and enhance particle recirculation. Experimental data for these different geometries is compared to exising horizontal tube correlations and the new model. The RMS deviation of data from the model is less than 17 %. The best correlation was obtained by modifying the Vreedenberg correlation to include a dependency on the particle fraction of the bed. The RMS deviation of data from the modified Vreedenberg correlation was 13. 8 %. Using both experimental data and the modified Vreedenberg correlation, economic optimizations were performed to compare fluidized bed dry cooling towers to a finned <b>tube</b> <b>tower.</b> For a 1000 mw plant, heat exchanger costs are 13 % lower for fluidized beds, but the fluidized bed is severely penalized by the cost for the power needed to keep the bed fluidized. The incremental cost of the fluidized bed is 16 % higher than that for a finned surface, but rapidly approaches the finned tube incremental cost as the particle size and bed depth are reduced.

The large wind turbines developed under this effort set several world records for diameter and power output. The MOD-2 wind turbine cluster of three turbines produced 7.5 megawatts of power in 1981. In 1987, the MOD-5B was the largest single wind turbine operating {{in the world with}} a rotor diameter of nearly 100 meters and a rated power of 3.2 megawatts. It demonstrated an availability of 95 percent, an unparalleled level for a new first-unit wind turbine. The MOD-5B had the first large-scale variable speed drive train and a sectioned, two-blade rotor that enabled easy transport of the blades. The 4 megawatt WTS-4 held the world record for power output for over 20 years. Although the later units were sold commercially, none of these two-bladed machines were ever put into mass production. When oil prices declined by a factor of three from 1980 through the early 1990s, many turbine manufacturers, both large and small, left the business. The commercial sales of the NASA/Boeing Mod-5B, for example, came to an end in 1987 when Boeing Engineering and Construction announced they were [...] "planning to leave the market because low oil prices are keeping windmills for electricity generation uneconomical." ...|$|R
