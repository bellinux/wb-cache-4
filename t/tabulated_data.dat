5|$|Dive tables or {{decompression}} {{tables are}} <b>tabulated</b> <b>data,</b> {{often in the}} form of printed cards or booklets, that allow divers to determine a decompression schedule for a given dive profile and breathing gas. In some cases they may also specify an altitude range. The choice of tables for professional diving use is generally made by the organization employing the divers, and for recreational training it is usually prescribed by the certifying agency, but for recreational purposes the diver is generally free to make use of any of the range of published tables, and for that matter, to modify them to suit himself or herself.|$|E

25|$|Monospaced fonts are typefaces {{in which}} every glyph is the same width (as opposed to variable-width fonts, where the w and m are wider than most letters, and the i is narrower). The first {{monospaced}} typefaces were designed for typewriters, which could only move the same distance forward with each letter typed. Their use continued with early computers, which could only display a single font. Although modern computers can display any desired typeface, monospaced fonts are still important for computer programming, terminal emulation, and for laying out <b>tabulated</b> <b>data</b> in plain text documents; {{they may also be}} particularly legible at small sizes due to all characters being quite wide. Examples of monospaced typefaces are Courier, Prestige Elite, Fixedsys, and Monaco. Most monospaced fonts are sans-serif or slab-serif as these designs are easiest to read printed small or display on low-resolution screens, though many exceptions exist.|$|E

The adjustment functions aim to correct for species difference in crown-stem relationships, wood to bark ratios, root to shoot ratios, and decay rates of dead tree component. If acceptable, adjustments are possible using {{a relatively small number of}} biomass studies for the species assessed; this would obviate the need to re-parameterise the FCP for each species, while still providing reasonably accurate predictions of carbon sequestration on an existing modelling platform.|$|R
