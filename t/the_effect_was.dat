5|$|Across {{languages}} and letters, the average {{probability of a}} letter being chosen {{as one of the}} six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> present but not to a significant degree. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered. There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter effect was still found across all languages.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the letter}} {{preference}} data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name. Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking by participants {{who did not have}} that number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference. The mean liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers in their birthday. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> stronger for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from the mean), and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their birthday than men did.|$|E
3000|$|... ■ If <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> positive, it {{indicates}} this land use type should be expanded, and {{the bigger the}} numerical value of <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> bigger <b>the</b> market <b>effect</b> to <b>the</b> land use will <b>be.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> negative, {{it indicates}} this land use type should be reduced, and the bigger the absolute value of <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> bigger <b>the</b> market <b>effect</b> to <b>the</b> land use is.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} reasons to think this <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> real. Firstly, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> seen in such {{a wide range of}} patients, medical and surgical, unselected and selected. Secondly, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> very {{consistent}} in terms of the degree of difference (10-15%). Thirdly, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> seen in many developed countries on several continents, all of which have a ‘Saturday/Sunday weekend concept’.|$|R
30|$|In occupations {{with more}} {{non-routine}} service content, we observe {{a very similar}} feature to the one observed for occupations with abstract contents, but <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> seems to <b>be</b> smaller, namely, those workers in occupations with more service content are becoming younger. In this case, and differently from what happened with occupations with more abstract content, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> {{found to be significant}} in the recession period. As in the previous two cases, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> stronger for males. Indeed, for females <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> not significant.|$|R
5|$|ILM's {{computer}} graphics division {{was responsible for}} creating three sequences, including the explosion of Praxis. Meyer's idea for <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> influenced by The Poseidon Adventure; Farrar used imagery of an immense wave hitting the Poseidon to inform the scale of their shock wave. The department built on a lens flare simulation to create a plasma burst composed of two expanding disc shapes with swirling detail texture mapped to the surface.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, W.D. Hamilton {{proposed}} a specific but widely applicable handicap mechanism, parasite-mediated sexual selection. He {{argued that in}} the never-ending co-evolutionary race between hosts and their parasites, sexually selected signals indicate health. This idea was tested in 1994 in barn swallows, a species where males have long tail streamers. Møller found that the males with longer tails, and their offspring, did have fewer bloodsucking mites, whereas fostered young did not. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> therefore genetic, confirming Hamilton's theory.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> to {{prohibit}} {{the use of}} public funds by any religious school, although it did not advance Grant’s other aim of requiring states to provide public education to all children. The bill passed the House but failed in the Senate. Although it never passed Congress, and left Blaine open to charges of anti-Catholicism, the proposed amendment served Blaine’s purpose of rallying Protestants to the Republican party and promoting himself as one of the party’s foremost leaders.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> mesomeric <b>effect</b> in {{chemistry}} <b>is</b> a property of substituents or functional {{groups in a}} chemical compound. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> used in a qualitative way and describes the electron withdrawing or releasing properties of substituents based on relevant resonance structures and is symbolized by the letter M. <b>The</b> mesomeric <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> negative (-M) when the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group and <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> positive (+M) when the substituent is an electron releasing group.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> Stark <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> pressure broadening (Stark broadening) of spectral lines by charged particles. When the split/shifted lines appear in absorption, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> called <b>the</b> inverse Stark <b>effect.</b>|$|R

5|$|Accordingly, William de Valence {{began to}} build a much larger castle around the {{original}} keep from the 1280s onwards, demolishing Marshal's earlier work. As part of the extremely expensive construction work, Valence used oak trees drawn from several royal forests. Valence was building {{at the same time}} that his nephew Edward I was constructing his major castles in the north of Wales, and the concentric castle that he built at Goodrich is both very similar in design and a rarity in England itself. Valence's son, Aymer de Valence built an additional line of outer defences before his death in 1324, including the external barbican, inspired by that at the Tower of London, and for which the earlier Valence barbican at Pembroke may have been an experimental forerunner. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> an early success in converting a fortress into a major dwelling, without damaging its defensive arrangements, and influenced the later castle conversion at Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|Although Mansfield's transformations between Jekyll and Hyde {{included}} lighting {{changes and}} makeup designed to appear different under colored filters, it was mainly accomplished by the actor's facial contortions {{and changes in}} posture and movement. As Hyde, Mansfield was hunched over with a grimacing face and claw-like hands; he spoke with a guttural voice and walked differently than he did as Jekyll. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> so dramatic that audiences and journalists speculated {{about how it was}} achieved. Theories included claims that Mansfield had an inflatable rubber prosthetic, that he applied chemicals, and that he had a mask hidden in a wig, which he pulled down to complete the change.|$|E
5|$|Bilinguals {{using two}} {{different}} alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets. A weaker effect should {{be found in}} the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with a tendency to like their name letters in Cyrillic also had a tendency to like their name letters in the Roman alphabet. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> found to be weaker in the second alphabet. This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.|$|E

50|$|The {{next set}} of {{substituent}}s are the halogens, for which <b>the</b> substituent <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> still positive but much more modest. The {{reason for this is}} that while <b>the</b> inductive <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> still negative, <b>the</b> mesomeric <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> positive, causing partial cancellation. The data also show that for these substituents, <b>the</b> meta <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> much larger than <b>the</b> para <b>effect,</b> due to <b>the</b> fact that <b>the</b> mesomeric <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> greatly reduced in a meta substituent. With meta substituents a carbon atom bearing the negative charge is further away from the carboxylic acid group (structure 2b).|$|R

5|$|During the 1990s {{and early}} 2000s, several city councils and {{autonomous}} communities had opened registers for civil unions that allowed benefits for unmarried couples of any sex, although <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> mainly symbolic. Registries {{were created in}} 16 out of 17 of Spain's autonomous communities; Catalonia (1998), Aragon (1999), Navarre (2000), Castile-La Mancha (2000), Valencia (2001), Balearic Islands (2001), Madrid (2001), Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002), Castile and León (2002), Extremadura (2003), Basque Country (2003), Canary Islands (2003), Cantabria (2005), Galicia (2008) and La Rioja (2010), and in both autonomous cities; Ceuta (1998) and Melilla (2008) Spanish law already allowed single people to adopt children; thus, a same-sex couple could undertake a de facto adoption, but the partner who was not the legal parent had no rights if the relationship ended or the legal parent died. Same-sex marriages were not legal in the autonomous communities, because the Spanish Constitution gives the State sole power to legislate marriage.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of rugby-style rules to American football, Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. Dissatisfied with what seemed to {{him to be a}} disorganized mob, he proposed his first rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of the line of scrimmage and the snap from center to quarterback, was also passed in 1880. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.|$|E
5|$|Ifs {{new owner}} was Robert Guinn, of Galaxy Publishing. The change of {{ownership}} was abrupt {{and led to a}} delay in publication, with the first issue under new editorship not appearing until July 1959. The editor was Horace Gold, who was also the editor of Galaxy Science Fiction; Galaxy had gone from a monthly to a bimonthly schedule at the start of 1959, and If and Galaxy appeared in alternate months for the next few years. In a 1975 retrospective article, Gold commented that his policy with If was to experiment, using new writers who had not yet established themselves. In the judgement of science-fiction historian Mike Ashley, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> that If became the weaker of the two magazines, printing stories that were of lower quality than those Gold selected for Galaxy.|$|E
40|$|A {{destructive}} {{combination of}} earthquakes, floods, droughts and other hazards make South Asia is the world's most disaster-prone region. <b>The</b> <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> aggravated by climate change, unsuitable social and development policies, and environmental degradation. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> to slow or block development and keep millions trapped in poverty...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> side-jump <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> {{a manifestation}} of the spin orbit {{interaction}} in electron scattering from an atom/ion/impurity. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> has a broad interest because of its conceptual importance for generic spin-orbital physics, in particular <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> widely discussed in spintronics. We reexamine <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> accounting for <b>the</b> exact nonperturbative electron wave function inside the atomic core. We find that value of <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> much smaller than estimates accepted in literature. The reduction factor is 1 /Z^ 2, where Z is the nucleus charge of the atom/impurity. This implies that <b>the</b> side-jump <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> practically irrelevant for spintronics, the skew scattering and/or the intrinsic mechanism always dominate the anomalous Hall and spin Hall effects...|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} trial, 38 Dutch-speaking local {{elementary}} school girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant {{preference for the}} letters of one's own name over {{those of the other}} person was found. The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last. All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out. No significant difference was found using family name rather than first name or both names. While <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> strongest for initials, subsequent data analysis revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.|$|E
5|$|Kenny Jackett stood down {{as manager}} {{following}} Watford's disappointing season, becoming assistant to Graham Taylor. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> immediate; Watford won six {{of their first}} seven league games, eventually becoming 1997–98 Second Division champions and earning promotion. Gibbs played part of the season at left-back due to an injury to Paul Robinson, although in turn Gibbs also missed games to injury. He started the 1998–99 season as a first-team regular, but sustained an injury {{in a game against}} Bolton on 20 October 1998, and only made two further appearances. Nonetheless, Watford secured promotion via the playoffs in Gibbs' absence, and when Watford won the play-off final to secure promotion, Gibbs {{was the first person to}} celebrate the win with Taylor.|$|E
5|$|One {{challenge}} for the production team was how to convey Bella's depression once Edward departs. In the novel, these pages were filled {{with the names of}} the passing months, and in the movie, would be represented as a visual effects shot with a camera circling around Kristen Stewart. The window that was used for the original film did not quite fit what Weitz was looking for, so the production team created a bay window when recreating the Swan house. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> one of the 300 visual effects helmed by Prime Focus led by visual effects supervisor Eric Pascarelli. It required matching two camera shots: one that shot the actress in a chair, and the other shooting the view outside the window as seen from the house built on location. Using a greenscreen, Prime Focus was able to enhance the changing of seasons with computer-generated leaves and falling snow.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Troxler <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> {{enhanced}} if <b>the</b> stimulus is small, is of low contrast (or [...] "equiluminant"), or <b>is</b> blurred. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> enhanced <b>the</b> {{further the}} stimulus is {{away from the}} fixation point.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the price}} changes from [...] to [...] the {{magnitude}} of <b>the</b> price <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> represented by <b>the</b> rectangle [...] and {{the magnitude of}} <b>the</b> quantity <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> given by rectangle [...] <b>The</b> price <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> loss of revenue from selling the original quantity at the lower price; <b>the</b> quantity <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> added revenue earned at the new price on the newly induced units sold.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Tocqueville <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{phenomenon}} that, {{as social}} conditions and opportunities improve, social frustration grows more quickly. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> based on Alexis de Tocqueville's {{observations on the}} French Revolution and later reforms in Europe and the United States. Another way to describe <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> aphorism [...] "the appetite grows by what it feeds on". For instance, after greater social justice is achieved, {{there may be more}} fervent opposition to even smaller social injustices than before.|$|R
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} by a single balanced rudder, which gave the ships excellent maneuverability. The rudder was augmented with special steering system on the engine transmissions; they had gears that could drive half of the engines astern and half forward allowed the screws to assist in turning the ship at sharper angles. The ships tended toward lee helm in general conditions, but in heavy wind, they suffered from weather helm. Both vessels also suffered from severe leeway at low speeds, and <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> especially pronounced for Nürnberg, owing to her larger superstructure.|$|E
5|$|The 19-year-old Geoff Emerick was {{promoted}} to replace Norman Smith as engineer on the first session for the Revolver album. This started at 8pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio Three at Abbey Road. Lennon told producer Martin {{that he wanted to}} sound like a hundred chanting Tibetan monks, which left Martin the difficult task of trying to find the effect by using the basic equipment they had. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, he inquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while he sang into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as it came out of the revolving speaker.|$|E
5|$|The Mahdists withdrew to the {{fortified}} town of Rejaf, while Chaltin's column {{marched in}} pursuit for seventeen miles until the occupied town was sighted at about one-thirty in the afternoon. A battery of artillery pieces fired on the Belgians {{as they came}} within range, but <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> negligible. As the Belgians approached, a hidden force of Mahdists emerged from a ravine near {{the bank of the}} Nile and attacked Chaltin's flank. The commandant realized the threat in time and repulsed the attack without much loss. Chaltin's companies then turned to begin the attack on the town. For several hours Chaltin's companies pushed through the streets and houses of Rejaf, forcing the Mahdists back until by seven o'clock they had been nearly expelled entirely. Only the citadel remained occupied, but by dawn the next morning the remaining Mahdist forces retreated, leaving behind their weapons and munitions.|$|E
