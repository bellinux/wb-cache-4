5|$|The {{buildings}} are considered fireproof by the New York City Fire Department because partitions between individual units are designed <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of flames, {{also known as}} compartmentalization. This is evidenced by a 2004 fire caused by a cigarette, where no one was seriously injured because the fire was self-contained.|$|E
5|$|The US government's {{response}} to this announcement was the adoption of containment, the goal of which was <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of Communism. Truman delivered a speech that called for the allocation of $400 million {{to intervene in the}} war and unveiled the Truman Doctrine, which framed the conflict as a contest between free peoples and totalitarian regimes. Even though the insurgents were helped by Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia, American policymakers accused the Soviet Union of conspiring against the Greek royalists in an effort to expand Soviet influence.|$|E
5|$|Hatoful Boyfriend {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} version of Earth in which sapient birds have seemingly taken the place of humans in society {{for reasons that are}} hinted at, but not fully explained in the dating simulation portion of the game. In Bad Boys Love, it is revealed that Hatoful is set in a post-apocalyptic, dystopian future—in which a pandemic of a deadly, mutated strain of the H5N1 virus, or bird flu, nearly wipes out mankind in the year 2068. The release of a counter-virus, cultivated to destroy the virus' avian carriers in a desperate attempt <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of the disease, ends up backfiring as birds who resisted the counter-virus instead developed human-level intelligence. War soon breaks out between the newly uplifted birds and the remnants of humanity, resulting in birds emerging as the planet's new dominant lifeforms as humans continued to succumb to the disease. Following several terrorist attacks by a human insurgency, all remaining humans have been forced to live in the wilderness away from civilization in a form of apartheid-like segregation.|$|E

50|$|On 14 October, Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei {{stated that}} the Palestinian Authority is unable <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> anarchy. While {{routinely}} blaming Israel for the PA's problems, {{he pointed out that}} the many PA security forces are hobbled by corruption and factional feuding. Due to the lack of governmentals reforms demanded by international peace mediators, Palestinian legislators demanded Qurei present a report on the matter by 20 October, at which point they will decide upon holding a no-confidence vote.|$|R

For example, more deaths in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake were caused by fire than by the earthquake itself.|$|E

40|$|Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) is {{spreading}} on agricultural fields in Germany, mainly in Brandenburg and Bayern. Competitive crops like winter cereals and oilseed-rape can reduce growth of this plant better than spring crops. In maize or cereals a chemical control is possible, but problems may arise {{because of the}} late emergence of ragweed and its high ability to regrowth. In crops like sunflower or lupines herbicide choice is limited and thus preventive control measures are crucial. An integrated approach is {{needed in order to}} avoid yield losses and <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> of ragweed in Germany...|$|R
50|$|The Svenska Federationen {{presented}} petitions to {{the governor}} of Stockholm in 1880 and 1902, and to the monarch in 1883. In 1903, a Motion (parliamentary procedure) {{was made in the}} Riksdag to investigate a method other than the reglementation of prostitutes <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> of Sexually transmitted infection. A government committee was formed, which presented their suggestion in 1910. The reglementation system was finally abolished in Sweden by the Lex Veneris Act of 1918. At the time of its abolition, the reglementation was already abolished in all cities where it had occurred except in the capital itself.|$|R

25|$|Missouri and Arkansas sent {{settlers}} into Kansas {{all along}} its eastern border. These settlers attempted to sway votes {{in favor of}} slavery. The secondary settlement of Americans in Kansas Territory were abolitionists from Massachusetts and other Free-Staters, who attempted <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of slavery from neighboring Missouri. Directly presaging the American Civil War, these forces collided, entering into skirmishes that earned the territory the name of Bleeding Kansas.|$|E

5|$|Rulers {{sponsored}} Theravada {{and often}} took steps <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> of Mahayana beliefs. Rulers such as Aggabodhi I, Kashyapa V (914–923) and Mahinda IV (956–972) promulgated disciplinary {{rules for the}} proper conduct of the Sangha. Voharika Tissa and Gothabhaya (249–262) expelled several monks from the order for supporting such views. A change in this occurred when Mahasena embraced Mahayana teachings and acted against Theravada institutions. However, he too accommodated Theravada teachings after the population rebelled against him. As the kingdom and the authority or kings declined, Mahayana and Tantric doctrines again began to spread, however, Theravada remained the main and most widespread doctrine.|$|R

25|$|The Spanish Civil War exposed {{political}} divisions across Europe. The {{right and}} the Catholics supported the Nationalists {{as a way to}} stop the expansion of Bolshevism. On the left, including labor unions, students and intellectuals, the war represented a necessary battle <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of fascism. Anti-war and pacifist sentiment was strong in many countries, leading to warnings that the Civil War had the potential of escalating into a second world war. In this respect, the war was an indicator of the growing instability across Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} to the ossuary used to be closed with a grill and a wooden door, which were destroyed by vandals who also destroyed several wooden coffins and stole some skulls and other bones. As a result, the portal was walled up in 1990. Thanks to this, the ossuary was saved from the flood which struck Olomouc in 1997. The entrance was reopened in 1998 to assess the range of necessary repairs and <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of mould, and was then walled up again.|$|E

50|$|Boreditis is a {{rare disease}} within preteens and teens in America. This illness has {{originated}} from the 1980s and is making a comeback in 2017. It mostly affects children from 9 to 17 years of age. Recently, it has been spreading rapidly all over the United States, Europe, and some of South America. From 2002, researchers have studied the disease's growth and is conducting research on how <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> of <b>the</b> illness. So far, it is uncurable. Boreditis is spread due to people hanging in groups and going on their phones 24/7 without interacting with another human being.

25|$|In {{the view}} of the State Department under President Harry S Truman, the United States needed to adopt a {{definite}} position on the world scene or fear losing credibility.

There was also some hope that the Eastern Bloc nations would join the plan, and thus be pulled out of the emerging Soviet bloc, but that did not happen.|$|E
