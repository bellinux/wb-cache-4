When Tillakaratne Dilshan asked for the umpire Mark Benson's decision to give him out caught behind to be reviewed, the English official changed his verdict when the television replay umpire Rudi Koertzen could not say conclusively that the ball had hit his bat or the ground on the way through to the Indian wicketkeeper.|$|E
25|$|After {{a school}} teacher {{suggested}} to her parents that her natural talent for singing and dancing should be nurtured, she was educated at the Aida Foster stage school {{from the age of}} 12, where she eventually became Head Girl. Her mother had to take an additional job to order to pay for the school fees. While training, she appeared in BBC Schools programmes. Webb later commented that, having come from a normal school, she found it a shock <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> perform in front of her classmates.|$|E

In many training stables, a horse is first introduced on the longe to nearly everything it is going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> do under saddle, including movement at all gaits, response to hand and voice commands (called riding aids), and remaining calm in unusual or stressful situations.|$|E

25|$|Wise was, however, {{taken seriously}} enough by the Topographical Engineers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> build a balloon. Mary Hoehling {{indicated}} that Captain Whipple of the Topographical Engineers told Lowe that Wise {{was preparing to}} bring up his own balloon, supposedly the Atlantic. Other accounts state that John LaMountain had taken possession of the Atlantic after a failed flight he made with Wise in 1859, and later place the Atlantic with LaMountain at Fort Monroe. Lowe's report says that Captain Whipple indicated they had instructed Mr. Wise to construct a new balloon. He also proposed that Lowe pilot the new balloon. Prof. Lowe was vehemently opposed to flying one of Wise's old-style balloons.|$|E
25|$|The Olympic Torch Relay ends {{on the day}} of {{the opening}} {{ceremony}} in the central stadium of the Games. The final carrier is often kept unannounced until the last moment, and is usually a sports celebrity of the host country. The final bearer of the torch runs towards the cauldron, often placed at the top of a grand staircase, and then uses the torch to start the flame in the arena. It is considered to be a great honor <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> light the Olympic flame. After being lit, the flame continues to burn throughout the Games, until the day of the closing ceremony and celebration, when it is finally put out, symbolizing the official end of the Games.|$|E
25|$|Hensleigh and Arad said in many {{interviews}} that Jane {{was the first}} and only actor <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> play the title role. Arad had previously pursued Jane for other roles in Marvel Studios films. He turned down The Punisher twice, as he did not see himself as a superhero actor. Jane said, when asked the second time to play the Punisher, that he became interested when Arad sent Tim Bradstreet's artwork of the character. After learning more about the Punisher, he accepted. Jane went on to read as many Punisher comics he could find to understand the character, and became a fan of the Punisher in the process. Jane trained for six to seven months with the United States Navy SEALs and gained more than twenty pounds of muscle for the part.|$|E

25|$|The main airport {{serving the}} GTA is Toronto Pearson International Airport in Mississauga, which is Canada's largest and busiest airport. It {{processed}} over 38.5 million passengers in 2014 and over 41 million passengers in 2015. Toronto Pearson International Airport is {{operated by the}} Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA), and could potentially be asked to help observe in {{the operations of the}} other airports in the area, but has yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> do so. John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport in nearby Hamilton also handles international flights handles some discount flights and charters and acts as an alternate to Pearson. The Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport on the Toronto Islands near downtown is used for civil aviation, air ambulance traffic and regional scheduled airlines (it handled nearly two million passengers in 2012). YTO is a multiple airport code for Pearson, City Centre, and Buttonville Municipal Airport (in Markham). There are also a number of smaller airports scattered throughout the GTA.|$|E
25|$|At a later {{election}} Hackett {{was opposed to}} John Madden, and this time lost by only a small margin. In 1882 he resigned his positions at Trinity College and went to Western Australia to become a squatter in the Gascoyne district. His first season was a bad one {{and he decided to}} give up the land. He joined forces with Charles Harper, the proprietor of The West Australian, and very soon his influence on this paper began to be felt. The Western Mail was established in 1885 and both papers became prosperous. In 1887 Hackett became editor of The West Australian and was a strong advocate of responsible government. Western Australia received its constitution in 1890, and Alexander Forrest selected Hackett as the first man <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> join the nominee Western Australian Legislative Council. The population of the colony was still under 50,000 but was beginning to rise, and the discovery of gold accelerated this. The newspapers grew with the population and became very valuable properties. Hackett, as editor, was writing a daily leading article, and was also the business manager.|$|E

Jan Levinson, Michael's former boss and lover played by Melora Hardin, reappeared in the [...] "Jan-as-diva" [...] mode. Tony Gardner, portrayed by Mike Bruner, cameos as a pianist. Novak rationalized that, despite Gardner being fired on his first day, the character might {{have appeared in the}} movie because he was [...] "intrigued" [...] and [...] "flattered" [...] that Michael—after apologizing [...] "profusely"—asked him, or that he might have been [...] "lonely".|$|E

Graham stated in 2011 that they [...] "set out to do right from the start" [...] making the episode more aimed at children, rather than adults and older Doctor Who fans, as the much darker finale would be broadcast following it.

Menzel, who is well known for her Broadway musical roles in Wicked (whose composer, Stephen Schwartz, wrote the lyrics to the film's songs) and Rent, was offered the role of Nancy Tremaine. Since the role did not require any singing, Menzel said in an {{interview}} that [...] "it was a compliment <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> just be hired on her acting talents alone." [...] Nancy is a fashion designer and Robert's girlfriend. She is named after Lady Tremaine, the stepmother from Cinderella.
