50|$|The noise {{generator}} is implemented as a 23-bit-length Fibonacci LFSR (Feedback polynomial: x^22+x^17+1). When using noise waveform simultaneously {{with any other}} waveform, the pull-down via waveform selector tends to quickly reduce the XOR shift register to 0 for all bits that {{are connected to the}} output DAC. As the zeroes shift in the register when the noise is clocked, and no 1-bits are produced to replace them, a situation can arise where the XOR shift register becomes fully zeroed. Luckily, the situation can be remedied by using the waveform control <b>test</b> <b>bit,</b> which in that condition injects one 1-bit into the XOR shift register.

40|$|A {{formulation}} of core-based system-on-chip (SoC) test sched- uling as a network transportation problem is presented. Given {{a set of}} tests,with demands for transportation of <b>test</b> <b>bits</b> (either for <b>test</b> stimuli or test response) and unrelated parallel test resources (e. g., test access mechanisms or built—in self-test engines), the authors determine the start times and resource mappings of all the tests such that the finish time for the complete SoC test is minimized. The problem is hard and they present an approximation algorithm using a result from {{the solution of the}} single source unsplittable flow problem. The proposed method uses the number of <b>test</b> <b>bits</b> that need to be transported for a test as the invariant and is hence relatively independent of the test application and execution model.

50|$|With the {{exception}} of MOS 3.50 where the space was reclaimed for more code, the area normally hidden by the input/output memory locations (the 768 bytes from 0xFC00-0xFEFF inclusive) in the MOS ROM contained {{a list of names}} of contributors to the system. This could be recovered by extracting the ROM and reading its contents in an EPROM programmer. Those who did not have such a device could access the ROM on a Master by setting a <b>test</b> <b>bit</b> of an access control register, then using a machine-code program to copy the ROM directly to text-mode screen memory.|$|E
50|$|At the X'2008 demo party, a {{completely}} new method of playing digitized samples was unveiled. The method allows for an unprecedented four (software-mixed) channels of 8-bit samples with optional filtering {{on top of all}} samples, as well as two ordinary SID sound channels. The method works by resetting the oscillator using the waveform generator <b>test</b> <b>bit,</b> quickly ramping up the new waveform with the Triangle waveform selected, and then disabling all waveforms, resulting in the DAC continuing to output the last value---which is the desired sample. This continues for as long as two scanlines, which is ample time for glitch-free, arbitrary sample output. It is however more CPU-intensive than the 4-bit volume register DAC trick described above. Because the filtering in a SID chip is applied after the waveform generators, samples produced this way can be filtered normally.|$|E
5000|$|The simuland for {{adaptive}} collaborative control {{centers on}} robotics. As such, adaptive collaborative control follows {{the tenets of}} control theory applied to robotics at its basest level. That means {{the states of the}} robot are observed at a given instant and noted if it is within some accepted bound. If it is not, the estimated states of the robot are calculated using equations of dynamics and kinematics at some future time. The process of entering observation data into the model to generate initial conditions is called initialization. The process of initialization for adaptive collaborative control occurs differently depending on the environment: robotics only and human-robotic interaction. [...] Under a robotics only environment, initialization occurs very similarly to the description above. The robotics, systems, subsystems, non-human entities observe some state it finds not in accordance with the higher-level strategy. The entities that are aware of this error use the appropriate equations to present a revised value for a future time step to its peers. For human-robotic interactions, initialization can occur at two different levels. The first level is what was previously described. In this instance, the robot notices some anomaly in its states that is not wholly consistent or is problematic with its higher-level strategy. It queries the human seeking advice to regulate its dilemma. In the other case, the human feels cause to either query some aspect of the robot’s state (e.g. health, trajectory, speed) [...] or present advice to the robot that is challenged against the robot's existing tactical approach to the higher-level strategy. The main inputs for adaptive collaborative control are a human-initiated dialogue based command or value presented by either a human or robotic element. The inputs used in the system models serve as the starting point for the collaboration.A number of ways are available to gather observational data for use in functional models. The easiest method to gather observational data is simple human observation of the robotic system. Self-monitoring attributes such as built-in <b>test</b> (<b>BIT)</b> can provide regular reports on important system characteristics. A common approach to gather observations is to employ sensors throughout the robotic system. Vehicles operating in teleoperations have speedometers to indicate how fast they travel. Robotic systems with either stochastic or cyclic motion often employ accelerometers to note the forces exerted. GPS sensors provide a standardized data type that is used nearly universally for depicting location. Multi-sensor systems have been used to gather heterogeneous observational data for applications in path planning.|$|E
30|$|In {{regard to}} English {{language}} testing, Iran has a rather {{long tradition of}} discrete-point English <b>tests</b> that <b>test</b> <b>bits</b> of language knowledge rather than the ability to communicate. In fact, to every school teacher and student in Iran, {{the notion of a}} language test is tantamount to a set of discrete-point, often multiple choice, written test items (see Farhadi and Keramati 2009 for an overview). For decades, this summative approach to measuring bits of English language knowledge has been in place, despite evidence of its negative washback effect (Riazi and Razavipour 2011). The recent ELT reform places emphasis on assessing communicative competence in all the four language skill areas. Mindful of the power of assessments in shaping and detouring curricula and defeating reforms, policy makers have called for a shift from <b>testing</b> <b>bits</b> of language knowledge to assessing the ability to communicate and assessment for learning (ibid). This is in stark contrast with the decades-long language testing tradition of the country, which focused exclusively on testing surface reading, isolated vocabulary knowledge, and grammar. As demanded by the new syllabus, all the four language skill areas are to be assessed, and aggregate scores should be computed for making final pass/fail decisions. Overall, the change in English language education seems to be quite ambitious and in the right direction.|$|R

40|$|DE 10164643 A UPAB: 20030903 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} {{feeding a}} <b>test</b> <b>bit</b> sequence simultaneously to two parallel optical paths in a receiver end and making {{copies of the}} sequence {{in the first and}} second paths. The copies are delayed so that all test bits occur in parallel in both paths at a time at which the signal amplitudes of all parallel bits in their respective channels are separately summed. The summed values are optoelectronically converted and differenced. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method involves repeated periodic addition of a characteristic <b>test</b> <b>bit</b> sequence from a number of test bits with 0 and 1 bits into a digital signal data stream at the transmitter end and filtering out and evaluating the <b>test</b> <b>bit</b> sequence at the receiver end. The <b>test</b> <b>bit</b> sequence is simultaneously fed to two parallel optical paths at the receiver end and a number of copies of the sequence corresponding to the number of 1 and 0 bits made in the first and second paths respectively.

40|$|Various {{efficient}} compression {{methods have}} been pro-posed for tackling the problem of increased test-data volume of contemporary, core-based Systems-on-Chip (SoCs).
