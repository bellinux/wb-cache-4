He goes on to write that the writing style—"the economy of words, the crisp writing"—lends itself well to a young audience.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{because of}} strict rules forbidding direct {{conversational}} {{interactions between the}} sexes, the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact with one another. Using the gandingan, {{young men and women}} would spend hours teasing, flirting, gossiping, playing guessing games, trading friendly insults and simply conversing with one another. For instance, if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him but the boy didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort <b>to</b> <b>telling</b> his friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he could use the gandingan to express his reasons and his friends would be able to pick up the message by translating his song.|$|E

25|$|Each episode {{follows the}} same pattern: Rodge, the dumber of the two, arrives home. Originally the pair {{would get into}} bed but in recent seasons they sit at the kitchen table. They talk about what Rodge was doing, with Podge usually {{insulting}} him. This leads Podge on <b>to</b> <b>telling</b> a story (acted out by live actors) about some people (whose names are usually sexual innuendos, e.g. Enda Meshank, Chris Peacock, Ulick McGee) who inevitably come to an unpleasant end. Rodge interrupts the story with stupid comments and/or reference to masturbation. It ends with Podge punishing Rodge for no reason.|$|E

40|$|What {{characteristics}} distinguish liars from truth-tellers? Recent {{research has}} explored "when" and "why" people lie. Yet {{little is known}} about "who" lies. Previous studies have led to mixed results about the effect of gender on deception, and they have largely neglected the role of other characteristics, such as age and level of education. To shed light on these questions, here I report a meta-analysis of 6, 508 distinct observations, collected in 50 Deception Game treatments, by 6 research groups. I find that: (i) males are more likely than females <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> black lies; (ii) males are more likely than females <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> altruistic white lies; (iii) males are (marginally) more likely than females <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Pareto white lies; (iv) age has no effect on the decision <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> black lies; (v) age has no effect on the decision <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> altruistic white lies; (vi) age has no effect on the decision <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Pareto white lies; (vii) educated subjects are more likely than non-educated subjects <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> black lies; (viii) the level of education has no effect on the decision <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> altruistic white lies; (ix) educated subjects are more likely than non-educated subjects <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Pareto white lies.

The Leland Stanford Mansion State Historic Park, which was completely restored in 2006, serves as the State's official address for diplomatic and business receptions.

The California State Railroad Museum in Old Sacramento has historical exhibits and live steam locomotives that patrons may ride. The California Automobile Museum, located just south of Old Sacramento, is filled with automotive history and vehicles from 1880 to 2006 and is the oldest non-profit automotive museum in the West. The mission of it is to preserve, promote, and teach automotive culture and its influence on our lives—past, present and future. In addition, the Sacramento History Museum, in the heart of Old Sacramento, focuses on the history of Sacramento from the region's pre-Gold Rush history through the present day.|$|E
25|$|Josie {{initially}} gets {{herself a}} job as a barmaid at The Queen Victoria public house and she later becomes the receptionist at Fred Fonseca (Jimi Mistry)'s surgery. However, things do not run smoothly for her in her new post. Josie is a strict perfectionist, she also expects perfection from everyone else and she isn't adverse <b>to</b> <b>telling</b> them so either. Her strict mannerisms only seek to frighten away half the patients. She eventually manages to settle down with a lot of coaching from Dr Fonseca, however, yet more problems arise when she discovers that her employer is homosexual. Josie is a strict Christian and she feels that working for a homosexual conflicts with her religious beliefs. She goes as far as to accuse him of coercing Kim into becoming a lesbian. She continues down a path of self-righteousness, judging everyone by her own, impossibly high standards. After she discovers that her son has become involved with ex-prostitute, Nina Harris (Troy Titus Adams), she cannot condone their friendship and her aloof manner towards Nina infuriates Mick. It takes bigoted remarks by racist Jim Branning (John Bardon) to make Josie realise that she is as prejudiced in her own way as he is, but by then it is too late. Having forgotten to renew her visa, she is threatened with deportation and is forced to return to Jamaica, leaving Kim in Mick's care. She promises Kim she will return when she sorts out her visa. Her last appearance is in February 2000.|$|E

Desperate to hold on to her husband, she announces that she is terminally ill and only has six months to live. Upon hearing this, Den becomes wracked with guilt, and so decides to revise his plans and stay with Angie. He sets about organising a second honeymoon for them in Venice. However, their holiday is ruined when Jan arrives, and upon seeing her and Den together, Angie starts drinking again having not long given up. On the way home from Venice on the Orient Express, a drunk Angie tells the barman all about her big lie. Unfortunately for Angie, Den overhears every word, and from that moment on he reverts to his original plan to leave her, although he decides to wait a while before letting Angie know that he knows about her lie. On Christmas Day that year, Den decides to get his revenge. Thinking that her marriage is safe, Angie is happier than ever - until Den informs her that he'd overheard her conversation with the barman, and he then serves her divorce papers as a Christmas present. This episode had the highest number of viewers the show has ever seen - with more than 30 million viewers (more than half of the British population) tuning in to see it. In response, Angie and Sharon pack their bags and walk out of the pub, choosing to take the route through the public area to cause Den the most embarrassment possible.|$|E

Harrison {{did not have the}} campaign trail to himself; Vice President Johnson told Van Buren that the President should [...] "go out among the voters as I intended doing".

An ageing Keenor became a target of {{frustrated}} fans as Cardiff entered a period of financial difficulty that saw the majority of the teams star names sold in a bid to raise funds and the team struggled in the Second Division. Prior to the 1930–31 season, Keenor, still on the wages he had been given when the club was in the First Division, was given a pay cut by the club of a quarter during the season and a half during the off season. The cut was offered by club director Walter Bartley Wilson, who had told Keenor that [...] "I'm sorry but I'm going to surprise you" [...] prior <b>to</b> <b>telling</b> him of the cut which was instigated to leave Keenor with no choice but to leave the club, however he replied to Wilson [...] "Bart, I'm going to surprise you too.

They eventually finished the season in 22nd position and were relegated to the Third Division South. Keenor played his final match for the club on 6 April 1931 against Tottenham Hotspur, along with the club's all-time record goalscorer Len Davies, before being released {{at the end of the}} season, ending a 19-year spell with the side.|$|E
