50|$|Besides {{boosting}} and economizing, it {{is possible}} to produce cascade subcooling systems, able <b>to</b> <b>subcool</b> the liquid with an analogous and separate system. This procedure is complex and costly as it involves the use of a complete system (with compressors and all of the gear) only for subcooling. Still, the idea has raised some investigation as there are some purported benefits. Furthermore, the United States Department of Energy issued a Federal Technology Alert mentioning refrigerant subcooling as a reliable way of improving the performance of systems and saving energy. Making this kind of system operationally independent from the main system and commercially possible is subject to study due to the mentioned claims. The separation of the subcooling unit from the main cycle (in terms of design) is not known to be an economically viable alternative. This kind of system usually requires the use of expensive electronic control systems to monitor the fluid thermodynamic conditions. Recently, a product capable of increasing the system's capacity by adding mechanical subcooling to any generic unspecific refrigeration system has been developed in Chile.|$|E

50|$|Another {{important}} and very common application of subcooling is its indirect {{use on the}} superheating process. Superheating is analogous <b>to</b> <b>subcooling</b> in an operative way, and both processes can be coupled using an internal heat exchanger. Subcooling here serves itself from the superheating and vice versa, allowing heat to flow from the refrigerant at a higher pressure (liquid), to the one with lower pressure (gas). This creates an energetic equivalence between the subcooling and the superheating phenomena {{when there is no}} energy loss. Normally, the fluid that is being subcooled is hotter than the refrigerant that is being superheated, allowing an energy flux in the needed direction. Superheating is critical for the operation of compressors because a system lacking it may provide the compressor with a liquid gas mixture, situation that generally leads to the destruction of the gas compressor because liquid is uncompressible. This makes subcooling an easy and widespread source of heat for the superheating process.|$|R

In contrast to conventional chilled-water or ice storage, it uses stored chilled water <b>to</b> <b>subcool</b> condenser refrigerant liquid instead of supplying cooling directly to a cooling load. Â For typical R- 134 a and R- 410 A systems, subcooling increases capacity by approximately. 5 to. 7 %/Â°F (~. 9 to 1. 3 %/K) without increasing compressor input power. Even larger performance improvements are possible with transcritical carbon dioxide systems. Â The subcooler is preferably a high-effectiveness, counterflow heat exchanger with approximately equal temperature change on both the water and refrigerant sides. This configuration allows warm water {{to return to the}} tank at a temperature that approaches the entering refrigerant liquid temperature. For air-cooled systems the water temperature change can be 60 to 80 Â°F (33 to 44 K) or even greater. The large temperature change greatly reduces the required tank size compared to conventional chilled-water storage, which is typically limited to a temperature change of about 10 to 20 Â°F (5 to 11 K). The high temperatures of warm water in the tank combined with lower nighttime air temperatures reduce energy required to cool the tank and improve overall system efficiency in addition to providing a large reduction in peak electric demand.

The TVS system was used <b>to</b> <b>subcool</b> the LCH 4 to a liquid saturation pressure of approximately 55. 2 kPa before the tank was pressurized with GHe to a total pressure of 165. 5 kPa. A total of 23 TVS cycles were completed. The TVS successfully controlled the ullage pressure within a prescribed control band but did not maintain a stable liquid saturation pressure. This was likely. due to a TVS design not optimized for this particular propellant and test conditions, and possibly due to a large artificially induced heat input directly into the liquid. The capability to reduce liquid saturation pressure as well as maintain it within a prescribed control band, demonstrated that the TVS could be used to seek and maintain a desired liquid inlet temperature for an engine (at a cost of propellant lost through the TVS vent).

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{relative}} freezing {{resistance of}} tissues in the stem, foliage and buds of terminal twigs from Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) was investigated at about ten-day intervals from summer {{until the following}} spring. Tissues from growing twigs collected before development of dormancy had no freezing resistance and were killed immediately after subcooling. Tissues {{at the base of}} inner bud scales and in the pith of stems at the base of buds were among the last to harden in autumn. Pith parenchyma and pith rays of the interfascicular region of the bud trace and the transfusion tissue in needles were most susceptible to injury after development of freezing resistance. Abaxial mesophyll was more susceptible to injury than adaxial mesophyll of hardened needles. The cortex was more resistant than other tissues during development of freezing resistance but parenchyma of the pith lost freezing resistance more slowly and was more resistant after growth processes resumed in the spring. The phloem-cambium region of the stem lost freezing resistance earlier and became more susceptible to injury than other tissues of the twig after midwinter 0 Survival of the vegetative apex depended on the ability of its water <b>to</b> <b>subcool.</b> Heat of fusion of water on freezing produced a sharp exotherm that was a precise index of the temperature at death and freezing resistance of the vegetative apex. Prolonged subfreezing temperatures after development of freezing resistance in late autumn increased hardiness of twigs beyond that induced by the natural environment 6 Both formation of ice in the pith of stems enclosed by coriaceous bud scales, and artificial dehydration reduced water content and promoted subcooling and freezing resistance of vegetative apices. Moisture content was reduced from 200 to 70 percent on a dry weight basis after three days at _ 90 C in early February and freezing resistance of apices increased 0 0 0 from - 16 C to - 20 C when cooled at 1 C per minute 0 These findings suggested that diffusion of water from the protoplasm to sites of extracellular ice, and not low temperature, was the direct cause of hardening at subfreezing temperatures 0 The basic freezing curve for Douglas-fir is characteristic of plant tissues in general but was modified by exotherms associated with freezing and death of vegetative apices from November until April. A decline n length of the plateau after the second subcooling temperature during hardening, and increase in length of the plateau during loss of hardiness reflected probable seasonal change in quantity of intracellular water. Unhardened tissues survived freezing of extracellular water but were injured before intracellular water was completely frozen. Hardened tissues, on the other hand, were not injured until after most of the intracellular water was frozen and the cooling rate of the stem returned to normal. Observations suggested a definite relationship between time of acquisition and loss of freezing resistance and number of days to bud burst after March 31. Trees which developed freezing resistance earliest in fall broke buds earliest in spring. Trees which broke buds latest in spring were also those which were the last to deharden, Ready availability of potassium appears to enhance early development and loss of freezing resistance. Trees with the highest content of potassium in the current season's foliage burst buds earliest and those with the lowest content of potassium were the last to burst buds. Night temperatures of 20 C delayed but did not prevent loss of hardiness when day temperatures were 250 C in March. However, continuous temperature of 2 ° C failed to reharden twigs that had lost freezing resistance at 25 ° C. Injury to all tissues, except the vegetative apex, declined at 250 C in March when moisture stress exceeded a critical level. These observations suggest that environ mental conditions unfavorable for growth enable Douglas-fir to maintain resistance to injury from spring frosts...|$|E
40|$|Author: House Ear Institute ### Preparative Techniques for the TEM For routine {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} (TEM), it is generally accepted that specimens should be thin, dry and contain molecules which diffract electrons. Biological specimens, which are large and consist of large amounts of water, also do not defract electrons and are therefore difficult {{to see in the}} TEM. Preparing biological specimens for the TEM, whilst retaining the structural morphology of the material, is a challenge. However, researchers have been looking at biological material for many years, and many protocols exist which allow us to look at biological material in many different ways. Below is a brief outline of some of the more common ways of looking at biological samples in the TEM. ### Whole mounts Small or very thin objects can be examined directly by mounting them onto a support film and introducing them directly into the electron beam. Contrast is provided by heavy metal precipitation in one of three ways. 1. Positive staining: The object is chemically stained with a solution of the metal salt and appears dark on a bright background. - Negative staining: The object remains unstained but is embedded in a dried film of the heavy metal salt. The specimen appears light on a dark background. This method of visualization has been used extensively in the study of virus particles but is also useful for cell fractions (e. g. coated vesicles). More details can be found [here]([URL] - Shadowing: A thin layer of heavy metal atoms is deposited on the specimen by evaporation in a vacuum chamber. Shadowing from one direction only produces a pseudo-three-dimensional image. Rotary shadowing, where the specimen is uniformly coated with heavy metal, is used to visualize nucleic acids and proteins. ### Ultrathin sectioning The most popular technique for examining biological materials is to embed the material under study in plastic and cut ultrathin sections that can be examined in a TEM. The material is stabilized by chemical fixation (usually with aldehydes such as formaldehyde or gluteraldehyde), contrasted with solutions of heavy metal salts (osmium tetroxide and uranyl acetate), dehydrated in ethanol or acetone, and embedded in plastic (epoxy resin). Ultrathin sections (60 nm) cut with glass or diamond knives using an ultramicrotome are floated on water, transferred to specimen support grids and examined in the TEM. Often the sections are further contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate prior to examination in the microscope. In some cases, macromolecules can be specifically labelled prior to embedding and sectioning. For example, the location of some enzymes can be visualized by incubating the tissue with a substrate whose reaction with the enzyme leads to the local deposition of electron opaque material. Alternately, antibodies can be coupled to such enzymes, and the electron opaque reaction product is used to localize the antigens recognized by the antibodies. Some embedding resins (e. g. Lowicryl resins and LR White resin) have been designed to enable antibodies and electron opaque markers (such as colloidal gold particles) to be applied to the ultrathin sections. In this way, subcellular antigens recognized by the antibodies can be localized with the TEM. Another sectioning technique that is increasing in popularity is [cryosectioning]([URL] (the sectioning of vitrified, frozen material). After chemical fixation, the tissue is immersed in cryo-protectant (usually sucrose) and then quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cryo-protectant allows the biological material to be frozen without the formation of ice crystals, which would damage ultrastructure. This type of freezing, or vitrification, is possible in the absence of cryo-protectants but is technically demanding. Sections cut from the vitrified block can be thawed and incubated with antibodies specific to subcellular antigens. Electron opaque markers allow the antibodies to be seen in the TEM. [Colloidal gold]([URL] coupled to protein A (a protein from bacterial cell walls which binds to the Fc portion of some immunoglobulins) has been used extensively in recent years to localize antibodies on resin and [frozen sections]([URL] of biological materials. The ability to produce homogeneous populations of colloidal gold with different particle sizes has enabled researchers to use these probes to colocalize different structures on the same section. ### Cryofixation It is possible to freeze biological material fast enough to vitrify the water present inside the cells. Vitrification of water occurs when the freezing has occurred so fast that ice crystals have no time to form. Vitrified biological material can be sectioned at low temperatures. Thin films of vitrified water and sections of vitrified material can be examined in transmission electron microscopes that are equipped with specimen stages that can be kept cold. ### Rapid Freezing Methods There are seven main rapid freezing methods presently available. They are: 1. immersion freezing - the specimen is plunged into the cryogen. - slam (or metal mirror) freezing - the specimen is impacted onto a polished metal surface cooled with liquid nitrogen or helium. - cold block freezing - two cold, polished metal blocks attached to the jaws of a pair of pliers squeeze-freeze the specimen. - spray freezing - a fine spray of sample in liquid suspension is shot into the cryogen (usually liquid propane). - jet freezing - a jet of liquid cryogen is sprayed onto the specimen. - [high pressure freezing]([URL] - freezing the specimen at high pressure <b>to</b> <b>subcool</b> the water. - excision freezing - a cold needle is plunged into the specimen, simultaneously freezing and dissecting the sample. ### Freeze-fracture followed by freeze etch and replication If, for some reason, the object to be studied cannot be examined in the TEM, then a thin replica can be made. This is usually made by evaporating a thin layer of a heavy metal (usually platinum) onto the specimen and then coating this with a thin layer of carbon. The object and the replica are separated either by floating off the replica or by digesting away the object. There are four basic steps to follow 1. The specimen is frozen (often without regard to [vitrification]([URL] - The specimen is fractured, while still frozen, under vacuum. - The fractured specimen can then be etched by leaving it frozen and under vacuum. Depending on the time of exposure, more or less water sublimes from the specimen (freeze drying). - A replica of the fractured surface is made which is then examined in the electron microscope. A recent modification of this method employs rapid freezing achieved by slamming cells against a copper block cooled to - 269 °C with liquid helium. If these frozen cells are then exposed to extensive freeze drying (deep etching), very impressive images of the internal structures of cells are uncovered...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increase}} of specific power, in development of modern engines, also the demand on the cooling system has significantly increased. CFD analysis reveals the occurrence of localized boiling, since often the measured temperature distribution cannot be explained by convective heat transfer alone. The requirement for highest heat transfer rates {{has led to the}} very promising concept of a controlled transition from pure convection <b>to</b> <b>subcooled</b> boiling in the critical thermal conditions. However, computational fluid dynamics is still unable to represent boiling flow, while any boiling based strategy requires a right prediction of heat transfer rates on the coolant surface inside IC engines.

In spite of this, it's very difficult its application to IC engines cooling passages where the definition of an hydraulic diameter for the model is very impractical. The present work proposes a new application model that, leaving every experimental aspect but taking advantage only from CFD analysis, solves the problems connected with direct application of Chen's model to coolant passages inside an IC engine.

Many studies were conducted {{to shed light on}} boiling {{heat transfer}} in microchannels.

Due to the increasing trend in critical heat flux and suppression of boiling instabilities with increasing mass velocity flow boiling {{is becoming more and more}} attractive at higher mass velocities, where subcooled boiling conditions are expected at high mass velocities.

Diameter ratios therefore varied from 530 : 1 to 51 : 1. The water velocity varied from 1. 8 to 13. 5 feet per second. Rectified alternating current was supplied to the wires. The current, wire surface area, wire resistance, and bulk water temperature were measured and from this data the average convective heat transfer coefficient calculated. The heat transfer coefficient varied from 1840 to 4990 BTU /hr. ft²[superscript. ]F for the 0. 0197 inch diameter wire to 7210 to 13000 BTU /hr. ft. ²[superscript. ]F for the 0. 0019 inch diameter wire.

The data correlated when plotted as N[subscript Nu]/N[subscript Prf]¹[superscript /]³ versus N[subscript Re] when the equivalent diameter was based on experimentally determined radii of maximum velocity in turbulent annular flow. Over the range of operating conditions studied the heat transfer coefficients were considerably lower than predicted by the usual empirical equations...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} actual CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) approaches <b>to</b> <b>subcooled</b> boiling and investigates their {{capability to}} contribute to fuel assembly design. In a prototype version of the CFD code CFX a wall boiling model is implemented based on a wall heat flux partition algorithm. It can be shown, that the wall boiling model is able to calculate the cross sectional averaged vapour volume fraction of vertical heated tubes tests with good agreement to published experimental data. The most sensitive parameters of the model are identified. Needs for more detailed experiments are established which are necessary to support further model development. The model is applied for investigation of the phenomena inside a hot channel of a fuel assembly. Here the essential phenomenon is the critical heat flux. Although subcooled boiling represents only a preliminary state towards the critical heat flux occurrence, essential parameters like swirl, cross flow between adjacent channels and concentration regions of bubbles can be determined. By calculating {{the temperature of the}} rod surface the critical regions can be identified which may later on lead to departure from nucleate boiling and possible damage of the fuel pin. The application of up-to-date CFD with a subcooled boiling model for the simulation of a hot channel enables the comparison and the evaluation of different geometrical designs of the spacer grids of a fuel rod bundle. 1...|$|R
40|$|Experiments on the {{transient}} {{film boiling}} heat transfer from a horizontal circular plate facing downward <b>to</b> a <b>subcooled</b> water at atmospheric pressure {{have been carried out}} by a quenching method. The test section used in the experiments is made of a copper cylinder with 30 mm in thickness and 50 mm in diameter, which is insulated on the sides and at the back surface by Teflon. Boiling curves are examined for saturated and subcooled conditions. Results show that film boiling heat fluxes are increased up to max. 230 % with increasing of liquid <b>subcooling</b> from 0 <b>to</b> 60 K...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to {{describe}} a general methodology suitable for analysing any intermediate configuration considered in staged vapour compression refrigeration cycles. This general methodology only depends on two basic parameters related <b>to</b> the <b>subcooling</b> and desuperheating obtained in the inter-stage system. A COP expression based on the two basic parameters {{was obtained from the}} general configuration. By means of its particularization to seven common configurations, it was then possible to make an energy comparison of the various configurations working with two fluids appropriated for the low temperature domain such as ammonia and R- 404 A...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was <b>to</b> predict if <b>subcooled</b> {{cryogenic}} liquid entering the bottom of a storage tank will destroy the thermal stratification of the tank. After an extensive literature search, a formula for maximum critical Reynolds Number which used to predict the destratification of a cryogenic tank was found. Example of calculations and graphics to determine the mixing of fluid in the tank were presented...|$|R
40|$|Forced {{convection}} {{film boiling}} heat transfer from a horizontal cylinder <b>to</b> a <b>subcooled</b> liquid cross-flowing upward is analysed based on the two-phase boundary-layer theory. Numerical solution of the conservation equations is determined for subcooled water, ethanol and hexane under the atmospheric pressure by the method {{similar to that of}} the first report for saturated liquid. The velocity profile, the separation point in the vapor film, the thickness of the boundary-layer and the average Nusselt number are discussed in the same manner as in the previous report and the effects of the subcooling and the approaching velocity on them are also examined. The calculated results on heat transfer are compared with the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Vapor {{compression}} {{refrigeration system}} is usually designed such that refrigerant exits a condenser at subcooled liquid state {{in order not}} to cause possible damage to expansion devices. Even in small refrigeration systems incorporating capillary tube as an expansion device, the refrigerant is supposed <b>to</b> be <b>subcooled</b> before entering the expansion device. In this study, experimental apparatus equipped with several thermocouples, pressure transducers and visualization device was constructed in order to observe the behavior of refrigerant flow at condenser outlet of a vapor compression refrigeration system. Visual observation as well as temperature and pressure readings indicate the presence of two-phase flow at highly subcooled temperature. An alternative equation was suggested to calculate the enthalpy of the two-phase refrigerant in subcooled region and verification test was conducted...|$|R
30|$|Thanks to two 1 mm-diameter K-type {{thermocouples}} and {{two other}} Eurotherm 3216 controlling the cartridges and the thermoelectric coolers, the two related temperatures could be set as constant. The gas temperature was measured at 20 mm of the aluminum plate and the subcooling temperature was measured in the cold aluminum plate. Depending on the sample, the surface sample temperature could vary from the measured temperature. Each sample surface temperature was thus measured and compared <b>to</b> the given <b>subcooling</b> temperature.|$|R
