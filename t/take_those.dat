5|$|Having {{published}} many novels, {{essays and}} short stories, Narayan {{is credited with}} bringing Indian writing {{to the rest of}} the world. While he has been regarded as one of India's greatest writers of the twentieth century, critics have also described his writings with adjectives such as charming, harmless and benign. Narayan has also come in for criticism from later writers, particularly of Indian origin, who have classed his writings as having a pedestrian style with a shallow vocabulary and a narrow vision. According to Shashi Tharoor, Narayan's subjects are similar to those of Jane Austen as they both deal with a very small section of society. However, he adds that while Austen's prose was able to <b>take</b> <b>those</b> subjects beyond ordinariness, Narayan's was not. A similar opinion is held by Shashi Deshpande who characterizes Narayan's writings as pedestrian and naive because of the simplicity of his language and diction, combined with the lack of any complexity in the emotions and behaviours of his characters.|$|E
5|$|They {{team up with}} a {{group called}} the Sweeper Alliance to storm the Apostles of the Stars' island, {{organized}} by Chronos assassin Lin Shaolee in disguise to act as decoys for Chronos' own attack. Separated upon arriving, Train, Sven and Eve each get involved in fights with members of the Apostles, while Chronos, who landed after them, get to Creed first. Sephiria Arks faces off against Creed, but loses. Sven, Eve and Chronos then fight bio-warrior weapons fused with nanotechnology, while Train begins his battle with Creed. Creed has obtained immortality, although he reveals to Train his only weakness; his brain cannot be repaired like the rest of his body. Train defeats Creed using one last full-powered railgun shot to destroy his Imagine Blade and Eve uses her own nanomachines to <b>take</b> <b>those</b> that give Creed immortality out of his body. Train and Sephiria allow Creed to walk away, and the survivors of the Apostles of the Stars are shown on the run or hiding.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 the British Ministry of Defence {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that a better short-range missile was needed, and drew up a request for proposals, AST 1218. This outlined the need for better maneuverability and a wider seeker angle, in order to successfully intercept the target in the types of shots the pilots were attempting to make, as opposed to demanding they not <b>take</b> <b>those</b> shots. AST 1218 also included the requirement that the missile could be carried by aircraft that lacked the target acquisition systems of the Phantom and Lightning.|$|E

25|$|I get {{the tune}} and then I {{just keep on}} singing the tune until the words come out from the tune. It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you <b>take</b> <b>those</b> words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E
25|$|On 15 March 1943, the Prime Minister {{disclosed}} {{in the floor}} of the Assembly that on several occasions, under the guise of discretionary authority, the governor disregarded the advice tendered by the ministry and listed those occasions. The governor did not <b>take</b> <b>those</b> allegations kindly, and, largely due to his initiative, no-confidence motions were voted in the assembly on March 24 and March 27. On both occasions the motions were defeated, although by narrow margins. To enforce his writ, the governor asked Huq to sign a prepared letter of resignation on 28 March 1943 and assigned himself the responsibility of administering the province under the provision of Section 93 of the constitution. A month later a League dominated ministry was commissioned with Nazimuddin as the Prime Minister. Huq’s party won much fewer seats during the Indian provincial elections, 1946.|$|E
25|$|Multiculturalism – Although the {{theoretical}} foundations of psychology {{are rooted in}} European culture, {{there is a growing}} recognition that there exist profound differences between various ethnic and social groups and that systems of psychotherapy need to <b>take</b> <b>those</b> differences into greater consideration. Further, the generations following immigrant migration will have some combination of two or more cultures—with aspects coming from the parents and from the surrounding society—and this process of acculturation can play a strong role in therapy (and might itself be the presenting problem). Culture influences ideas about change, help-seeking, locus of control, authority, and the importance of the individual versus the group, all of which can potentially clash with certain givens in mainstream psychotherapeutic theory and practice. As such, there is a growing movement to integrate knowledge of various cultural groups in order to inform therapeutic practice in a more culturally sensitive and effective way.|$|E

[...] To avoid putting myself into a corner and writing something I wouldn't be able to shoot, I made a list of the givens in the situation and tried to <b>take</b> <b>those</b> givens and juggle them into the final scenario." ...|$|E

The recording {{took place on}} October 16 and October 17, 1989. Malkmus {{was influenced by the}} rehearsal style of jazz musicians as significant to the EP's recording, saying [...] "When we start recording, we're really focused on what we're doing. We know how it's going to sound in the studio. We don't have to worry if it's sounding good in the rehearsal space.

500|$|At 4:30 p.m., Hood {{stood in}} his {{stirrups}} {{at the front of}} the Texas Brigade and shouted, [...] "Fix bayonets, my brave Texans! Forward and <b>take</b> <b>those</b> heights!" [...] It is unclear to which heights he was referring. His orders were to cross the Emmitsburg Road and wheel left, moving north with his left flank guiding on the road. This discrepancy became a serious problem when, minutes later on Slyder's Lane, Hood was felled by an artillery shell bursting overhead, severely wounding his left arm and putting him out of action. His division moved ahead to the east, no longer under central control.|$|E
500|$|From {{growing up}} in the Seward {{household}} with Canon Seward {{and the members of the}} Lunar Society, Honora Sneyd and her childhood friend Anna Seward developed relatively progressive views for the times on the status of women and equality in marriage, a key to which was female education. Sneyd entered into marriage with Richard Edgeworth on the understanding that they were equal partners in his work. Anna and later Honora's stepdaughter, Maria Edgeworth, were to <b>take</b> <b>those</b> values and promote them in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century Britain, the ancestors of modern feminists. Today Honora's position on women's rights is best remembered for her rebuke of Thomas Day and his theory of the [...] "perfect wife".|$|E
500|$|That {{sense of}} {{crossing}} cultural boundaries was, for Al Kooper, {{at the heart}} of Blonde on Blonde: [...] " [...] was the quintessential New York hipster—what was he doing in Nashville? It didn't make any sense whatsoever. But you <b>take</b> <b>those</b> two elements, pour them into a test tube, and it just exploded." [...] For Mike Marqusee, Dylan had succeeded in combining traditional blues material with modernist literary techniques: [...] " [...] took inherited idioms and boosted them into a modernist stratosphere. 'Pledging My Time' and 'Obviously 5 Believers' adhered to blues patterns that were venerable when Dylan first encountered them in the mid-fifties (both begin with the ritual Delta invocation of [...] "early in the mornin"). Yet like 'Visions of Johanna' or 'Memphis Blues Again', these songs are beyond category. They are allusive, repetitive, jaggedly abstract compositions that defy reduction." ...|$|E

500|$|As Hancock rode {{north to}} find {{additional}} reinforcements, he saw Wilcox's brigade nearing {{the base of}} the ridge, aiming at a gap in the Union line. The timing was critical, and Hancock chose the only troops at hand, the men of the 1st Minnesota, Harrow's Brigade, of the 2nd Division of the II Corps. They were originally placed there to guard Thomas's U.S. Battery. He pointed to a Confederate flag over the advancing line and shouted to Col. William Colvill, [...] "Advance, Colonel, and <b>take</b> <b>those</b> colors!" [...] The 262 Minnesotans charged the Alabama brigade with bayonets fixed, and they blunted their advance at Plum Run but at horrible cost215 casualties (82%), including 40 deaths or mortal wounds, one of the largest regimental single-action losses of the war. Despite overwhelming Confederate numbers, the small 1st Minnesota, with the support of Willard's brigade on their left, checked Wilcox's advance and the Alabamians were forced to withdraw.|$|E
500|$|Both studio co-founder Jordan Weisman and {{executive}} producer Ray Winninger had experience developing both tabletop games and video games. One of the studio's motivations for developing the game was to combine the two mediums, with Winninger explaining [...] "One of the spaces we're interested in exploring at Harebrained, and Golem is the first effort, is how can we <b>take</b> <b>those</b> tabletop games that we know and love so much and leverage technology to enhance that experience in some way." [...] Weisman and Winninger also stressed the social nature of the game. Winninger, comparing Golem Arcana to Skylanders, another game with both physical and digital components, stressed that Golem Arcana was less focused on components and more focused on the social experience. Weisman pointed to his disappointment that [...] "kids' idea of playing together after school these days usually means just meeting online from their own houses" [...] in stressing that participants playing {{against each other in}} Golem Arcana would do so face-to-face.|$|E
500|$|In {{his notes}} of the Philadelphia Convention in 1787, James Madison {{expressed}} the fear that members of Congress would create new federal jobs, or increase the salaries for existing jobs, and then <b>take</b> <b>those</b> jobs for themselves. Madison wrote that corrupt legislative actions, {{in the form of}} the unnecessary creation of offices and the increase of salaries for personal benefit, were one of his greatest concerns. The delegates who were present agreed that no member of Congress should be eligible to be appointed to an executive position while serving in Congress. Madison originally proposed a one-year length on such a bar. However, Nathaniel Gorham, James Wilson, and Alexander Hamilton wanted no bar at all at the conclusion of congressional service. Eventually, Madison proposed a compromise: [...] "that no office ought to be open to a member, which may be created or augmented while he is in the legislature"; this led to extensive debate.|$|E

500|$|After {{being named}} Most Valuable Player (MVP) {{at the prestigious}} Boston Shootout and {{acknowledged}} as the leading participant at the Nike camp, Howard was mentioned as the best prospect in the country. By this time, he had dropped Michigan State and Illinois from his list of possible college destinations and had begun considering UNLV as well. Following his time at the Nike camp, his household was besieged by recruiters. Howard issued the following statement: [...] "Contact my coach. I do not want my grandmother and aunt upset about calls at all {{times of the day}} and night. I'm not the only person who lives in this house. I think my wishes should be respected. If not, {{when it comes time to}} make my decision, I'll <b>take</b> <b>those</b> things into account." [...] Although Howard was the best performer at the camp, talent scout Bob Gibbons felt Webber and Robinson were equally talented prospects. [...] Despite Howard's most recently listed college preferences and the fact that the team was under investigation for recruiting violations, Illinois continued pursuing Howard as its number one recruit. [...] By the end of July 1990, Howard was projected to sign with Michigan.|$|E
