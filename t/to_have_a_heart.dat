5|$|When Tom goes missing, Darren {{is desperate}} to find him. Thinking that Tom has run away, he assumes {{that he will}} come home if Nancy is there and convinces Sienna to change her {{statement}} about Nancy. Nancy is released from the mental institute because of this. However, it is revealed that Sienna actually kidnapped Tom and kept him hostage in a basement. Tom is able to escape and along with Nancy, they expose Sienna for everything. Sienna attacks Nancy causing her to have temporary brain damage and attempts to kill Tom, Charlie and Oscar although they are saved and Nancy recovers. Following Darren's treatment of Nancy, things are hard between them and get even worse when Nancy attempts to get revenge on Darren. However, they eventually reconcile and get engaged again. However, things only get worse when Sienna blackmails Darren to get Tom to change his statement or she'll create even more problems for the Osbornes. Following a heart attack, Darren is given angina spray however Sienna takes this while Darren is on a camping trip and Nancy leaves him on his own on the trip following an argument. Darren starts <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack and Sienna, realizing what she's done, saves him at the last minute.|$|E

5|$|The NGC 4038 Group is a {{group of}} galaxies across Corvus and Crater. The group may contain between 13 and 27 galaxies. The best-known member is the Antennae {{peculiar}} galaxy, located 0.25 north of 31 Crateris. It consists of two interacting galaxies—NGC 4038 and 4039—that appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> shape as seen from Earth. The name originates from the huge tidal tails that come off the ends of the two galaxies, formed because of the spiral galaxies' original rotation. Both original galaxies were spiral galaxies and are now experiencing extensive star formation due to the interaction of gas clouds. The galaxies are 45 million light-years from Earth and each has multiple ultraluminous X-ray sources, the source of which is unknown. Astronomers theorize that they may be a rare type of x-ray emitting binary stars or intermediate-mass black holes. The Antennae Galaxies appear in a telescope at the 10th magnitude. SN 2004gt was a type Ic supernova that erupted on December 12, 2004. The progenitor was not identified from older images of the galaxy, and is either a type WC Wolf–Rayet star with a mass over 40 times that of the Sun, or a star 20 to 40 times as massive as the Sun in a binary star system. SN 2007sr was a Type Ia supernova event that peaked in brightness on December 14, 2007. The galaxy has been identified as a good place to take detailed images in case of further supernovae.|$|E
25|$|Smoking also {{increases}} {{the chance of}} heart disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, and peripheral vascular disease. Several ingredients of tobacco lead to the narrowing of blood vessels, increasing {{the likelihood of a}} blockage, and thus a heart attack or stroke.

25|$|The storyline {{leading up}} to the match was that JBL caused Guerrero's mother <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack at a house show when he {{threatened}} her and grabbed her by the shoulder. At Judgment Day, JBL defeated Guerrero via disqualification in a match for the WWE title. A title cannot change hands by disqualification, so Guerrero retained the title. JBL controversially won his sole world championship, the WWE Championship from Guerrero in a Texas Bull Rope match at The Great American Bash. The initial decision of Guerrero's victory was reversed by then-General Manager Kurt Angle, awarding the match and the title to JBL; the replay showed that JBL touched the fourth corner before Guerrero. JBL won a rematch in a steel cage two weeks later, again with Angle's assistance.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} health {{problems}} associated with Newfoundlands. Newfoundlands are prone to hip dysplasia (a malformed ball and socket in the hip joint). They also get Elbow dysplasia, and cystinuria (a hereditary defect that forms calculi stones in the bladder). [...] Another genetic problem is subvalvular aortic stenosis (SAS). This is <b>a</b> common <b>heart</b> defect in Newfoundlands involving defective heart valves. SAS can cause sudden death at an early age. It is similar <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack. [...] It is common that [...] "Newfs" [...] live to be 8 to 10 years of age; 10 years is a commonly cited life expectancy. But, Newfoundlands can live up to 15 years old.|$|R
25|$|People {{with higher}} levels of vitamin D tend to have lower rates of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke and tend to have lower blood pressure. However, it has been found that vitamin D supplementation does not improve {{cardiovascular}} health or metabolism, so the link with vitamin D must be in part indirect. People who get more sun are generally healthier, and also have higher vitamin D levels. It has been found that ultraviolet radiation (even UVA) produces nitric oxide (NO) in the skin, and nitric oxide can lower blood pressure. High blood pressure increases the risk of stroke and heart disease. Although long-term exposure to ultraviolet contributes to non-melanoma skin cancers that are rarely fatal, it has been found in a Danish study that those who get these cancers were less likely to die during the study, and were much less likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack, {{than those who did not}} have these cancers.|$|E

[...] Many reviewers agreed with this sentiment, commenting on the {{transition}} from a [...] "spoiled brat" [...] to a young, confused, but courageous teenager were noted by several reviewers positively. Times reviewer James Poniewozik emphasized the growth of Robb Stark's character, praising both Martin's writing and Richard Madden's acting. Maureen Ryan highlighted the scene where Syrio Forel confronts the Lannister men to allow Arya's escape, which she considered masterfully staged.|$|E

Conversely, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{described}} [...] "Love Is a Camera" [...] as a [...] "bogged down in pretension" [...] moment in Wanderlust; Erlewine {{went on to}} criticize the song's [...] "ceaseless pomp". Kate Bennett of musicOMH wrote that [...] "Love Is a Camera" [...] was [...] "more of the same" [...] "heroine-gazing-forlornly-into-the-distance."

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} filming, {{in early}} February 1964, Sellers met Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi. On 19 February 1964, just ten days after their first meeting, the couple married. Sellers soon showed signs of {{insecurity}} and paranoia; he would become highly anxious and jealous, for example, when Ekland starred opposite attractive men. Shortly after the wedding, Sellers started filming on location in Twentynine Palms, California for Billy Wilder's Kiss Me, Stupid, opposite Dean Martin and Kim Novak. The relationship between Wilder and Sellers became strained; both had different approaches to work and often clashed as a result. On the night of 5 April 1964, prior to having sex with Ekland, Sellers inhaled amyl nitrites (poppers) as a sexual stimulant in his search for [...] "the ultimate orgasm", and suffered a series of eight heart attacks {{over the course of}} three hours as a result. His illness forced him to withdraw from the filming of Kiss Me, Stupid and he was replaced by Ray Walston. Wilder was unsympathetic about the heart attacks, saying that [...] "you have <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> before you can have an attack".|$|E
500|$|Nearly all Cavaliers {{eventually}} {{suffer from}} {{disease of the}} mitral valve, with heart murmurs which may progressively worsen, leading to heart failure. This condition is polygenic (affected by multiple genes), and therefore all lines of Cavaliers worldwide are susceptible. It {{is the leading cause}} of death in the breed. A survey by The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom showed that 42.8% of Cavalier deaths are cardiac related. The next most common causes are cancer (12.3%) and old age (12.2%). The condition can begin to emerge at an early age and statistically may be expected to be present in more than half of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels by age 5. It is rare for a 10-year-old Cavalier not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> murmur. While heart disease is common in dogs generally– one in 10 of all dogs will eventually have heart problems– mitral valve disease is generally (as in humans) a disease of old age. The [...] "hinge" [...] on the heart's mitral valve loosens and can gradually deteriorate, along with the valve's flaps, causing a heart murmur (as blood seeps through the valve between heartbeats) then congestive heart failure. The Cavalier is particularly susceptible to early-onset heart disease, which may be evident in dogs as young as one or two years of age.|$|E

500|$|Josephine made {{landfall}} {{in northwestern}} Florida along Apalachee Bay {{and produced a}} high storm surge of around [...] in Suwannee, causing minor to moderate beach erosion. The storm produced widespread tropical storm force wind gusts in the state, and the highest sustained winds were 45mph (72km/h) along the Sunshine Skyway Bridge; the same location reported a peak gust of 72mph (115km/h). Josephine dropped heavy rainfall in the state, peaking at [...] in Fernandina Beach. The storm also spawned at least 16tornadoes in northern Florida, most of which caused minor tree damage. One [...] wide tornado, rated an F2, remained {{on the ground for}} [...] in Edgewater, which damaged 130houses, 30 of them severely. The tornado caused a woman <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack in Edgewater, and its damage was estimated at $2.4million. In western Florida, the high tides flooded roads and buildings along the coast. Between Levy to Lee county along the gulf coast, Josephine flooded about 3,600homes, mostly west of U.S. Route 19. The heaviest storm surge damage was in Pinellas County, where about 1,400homes were affected, causing $25million in damage. One person was injured in the county when a man was surfing in rough seas. The high tides damaged three fishing piers along the west coast. In Clay County, flooding rains forced about a dozen families to seek shelter elsewhere, and a few roads were washed out. In Jacksonville, high rains flooded hundreds of roads and caused schools countywide to close. Street flooding occurred as far south as the Florida Keys. High winds caused sporadic wind damage across northern Florida, and about 400,000people lost power statewide. Following the storm, President Bill Clinton declared 16counties as disaster areas, which made them eligible for federal assistance in reconstructing.|$|E

2500|$|Dickens {{is often}} {{described}} as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his caricatures and the ugly social truths he reveals.

In the days following Lawrence's murder, several residents came forward to provide names of suspects and an anonymous note was also left on a police car windscreen and in a telephone box naming a local gang as the five main suspects. [...] The suspects were Gary Dobson, brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt, Luke Knight and David Norris. [...] In February 1999, officers investigating the handling of the initial inquiry revealed that a woman who might have been a vital witness had telephoned detectives three times within the first few days after the killing, and appealed for her to contact them again. The five suspects were previously involved in racist knife attacks around the Eltham area. Four weeks before Lawrence's death, Dobson and Neil Acourt were involved in the racist attack of a black teenager, Kevin London, whom they verbally abused and attempted to stab. Neil's brother Jamie was accused of stabbing teenagers Darren Witham in May 1992 and Darren Giles in 1994, causing Giles <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack.
