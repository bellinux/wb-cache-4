25|$|This type is {{the most}} basic, but {{can be a good}} choice for hard rock, multi-laterals and {{underbalance}} drilling. It involves leaving the productive reservoir section without any <b>tubulars.</b> This effectively removes control of flow of fluids from the formation; it is not suitable for weaker formations which might require sand control, nor for formations requiring selective isolation of oil, gas and water intervals. However, advances in interventions such as coiled tubing and tractors means that barefoot wells can be successfully produced.|$|E

5000|$|Oil and gas TENORM and/or NORM {{is created}} in the {{production}} process, when produced fluids from reservoirs carry sulfates {{up to the surface}} of the Earth's crust. Some states, such as North Dakota, uses the term [...] "diffuse NORM". Barium, calcium and strontium sulfates are larger compounds, and the smaller atoms, such as radium 226 and radium 228, can fit into the empty spaces of the compound and be carried through the produced fluids. As the fluids approach the surface, changes in the temperature and pressure cause the barium, calcium, strontium and radium sulfates to precipitate out of solution and form scale on the inside, or on occasion, the outside of the <b>tubulars</b> and/or casing. The use of <b>tubulars</b> in the production process that are NORM contaminated does not cause a health hazard if the scale is inside the <b>tubulars</b> and the <b>tubulars</b> remain downhole. Enhanced concentrations of the radium 226 and 228 and the daughter products such as lead-210 may also occur in sludge that accumulates in oilfield pits, tanks and lagoons. Radon gas in the natural gas streams concentrate as NORM in gas processing activities. Radon decays to lead-210, then to bismuth-210, polonium-210 and stabilizes with lead-206. Radon decay elements occur as a shiny film on the inner surface of inlet lines, treating units, pumps and valves associated with propylene, ethane and propane processing systems.|$|E

40|$|In vitro {{modulation}} of <b>tubular</b> cyst regression in murine {{polycystic kidney}} disease. Recent studies in a murine model of genetically-determined polycystic kidney disease, the CPK mouse, {{have suggested that}} alterations in renal Na-K ATPase activity in concert with <b>tubular</b> epithelial hyperplasia have pathogenic import in proximal <b>tubular</b> cyst formation. In the current study, we therefore studied the relative roles of Na-K ATPase activity, <b>tubular</b> epithelial hyperplasia, and basal lamina alterations during in vitro modulation of proximal <b>tubular</b> cyst regression during serum-free organ culture of newborn CPK kidneys. Under basal in vitro conditions, regression of CPK proximal <b>tubular</b> cysts was demonstrated in association with progressive decreases in Na-K ATPase activity and <b>tubular</b> epithelial hyperplasia. The pattern of proximal <b>tubular</b> cyst regression was modified by: a) Na-K ATPase activity induction with triiodothyronine, which promoted proximal <b>tubular</b> cystogenesis; and b) Na-K ATPase activity inhibition with ouabain, which blocked the effects of T 3 {{on the process of}} cyst formation. Modulation of proximal <b>tubular</b> cystogenesis by Na-K ATPase induction and inhibition were accomplished without significant changes in proximal <b>tubular</b> epithelial hyperplasia or expression of basal lamina components. We conclude that increased Na pump activity may have a significant role in proximal <b>tubular</b> cyst formation and progressive enlargement in the CPK mouse...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tubular</b> {{proteinuria}} is proteinuria (excessive {{protein in}} the urine) caused by renal <b>tubular</b> dysfunction.

40|$|AbstractWe {{hypothesized}} that HIV- 1 may enter <b>tubular</b> cells by phagocytosis of apoptotic fragments of HIV- 1 -infected T cells infiltrating <b>tubular</b> interstitium. The {{study was designed}} to evaluate the interaction of programmed death- 1 (PD- 1) receptors on CD 4 T cells and programmed death ligand- 1 (PD-L 1) on <b>tubular</b> cells (HK 2 and HRPTEC, primary <b>tubular</b> cells). Co-cultivation of HIV- 1 infected lymphocytes (HIV-LY) with HK 2 s/HRPTECs resulted in T cell apoptosis, uptake of the apoptosed HIV-LY by HK 2 s/HRPTECs, <b>tubular</b> cell activation and HIV expression. Cytochalasin-B inhibited <b>tubular</b> cell HIV-LY uptake and anti-PD-L 1 antibody inhibited HIV-LY apoptosis and <b>tubular</b> cell HIV-LY uptake, activation and HIV expression. These observations do indicate induction of apoptosis of T cells due to interaction of PD- 1 and PD-L 1 upon co-cultivation and subsequent phygocytosis of HIV-laden apoptotic bodies by <b>tubular</b> cells and thus the transfer of HIV- 1 into <b>tubular</b> cells. These findings identify a novel pathway that facilitates HIV- 1 entry into <b>tubular</b> cell...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a new <b>tubular</b> PhotoBioReactor (PBR) called twisted <b>tubular</b> PBR. The {{geometry of}} a twisted <b>tubular</b> PBR induces swirl mixing to guarantee good exposure of microalgae to Light-Dark (LD) cycles {{and to the}} nutrients and dissolved CO 2. The paper analyses the energy uptake for fluid transport through the twisted <b>tubular</b> PBR. The analysis {{is based on a}} comparison between the twisted <b>tubular</b> PBR and other <b>tubular</b> PBRs that have swirl mixing generation. Four types of <b>tubular</b> PBRs are simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD); these results are used to evaluate energy consumption and mixing conditions. Swirl number is used to evaluate mixing conditions and swirl flow. On the other hand, microalgae particles performing undulatory motion are evaluated with Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Characteristics of the microalgae frequency in the swirl mixing depend on average flow velocity. Results show that the new twisted <b>tubular</b> PBR demands less energy for pumping than the other <b>tubular</b> PBRs that have swirl motion; providing an important step towards the construction of a highly efficient <b>tubular</b> PBR...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: HIV-associated {{nephropathy}} {{is accompanied}} by significant <b>tubular</b> alterations {{in the form of}} <b>tubular</b> cell proliferation, apoptosis, and microcystic dilatation. In the present study we evaluated the role of CD 4 receptors in HIV- 1 -induced <b>tubular</b> cell injury. METHODS: To confirm the presence of CD 4 receptors in <b>tubular</b> cells, immunocytochemical, Western and Northern blot studies were carried out. To determine the downstream effect of CD 4 and gp 120 interaction, we evaluated the effect of gp 120 on <b>tubular</b> cell p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and phosphorylation. To establish causal relationships between gp 120, CD 4, and p 38 MAPK pathways, we studied the effect of anti-CD 4 antibody and SB 202190 (an inhibitor of p 38 MAPK) on gp 120 -induced <b>tubular</b> cell apoptosis. RESULTS: Proximal <b>tubular</b> cells in culture as well as in intact tissue showed expression of CD 4 (immunocytochemical and Western blot studies). Cultured <b>tubular</b> cells also showed mRNA expression for CD 4 (Northern blot studies). Gp 120, at concentrations of 10 - 100 ng/ ml, triggered <b>tubular</b> cell apoptosis; however, this effect of gp 120 was inhibited by anti-CD 4 antibody. SB 202190 also inhibited gp 120 -induced <b>tubular</b> cell apoptosis. In addition, gp 120 promoted <b>tubular</b> cell p 38 MAPK phosphorylation in a time- and dose- dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Gp 120 through interaction with CD 4 triggers <b>tubular</b> cell apoptosis. This effect of gp 120 on <b>tubular</b> cells is mediated through phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the {{finite element analysis}} of <b>tubular</b> expansion in oval bore holes such as those frequently observed in Upper Natih reservoirs. The minimum inner diameter of the expanded <b>tubular</b> must be larger than the drift diameter set by American Petroleum Institute (API) standards.

The phenomenon of <b>tubular</b> ovality has been previously unknown to petroleum industry. Finite element model of <b>tubular</b> expansion in oval bore-holes is developed to determine the <b>tubular</b> ovality and compared with measured ovality. It was found that ovality increases linearly with <b>tubular</b> expansion ratio.

40|$|Background: Renal {{ischemia}} {{leads to}} apoptosis of <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells {{and results in}} decreased renal function. Tissue repair involves re-epithelialization of the <b>tubular</b> basement membrane. Survival of the <b>tubular</b> epithelium following ischemia is therefore important in the successful regeneration of renal tissue.

Methodology/Principal Findings: In a mouse model for renal ischemia/reperfusion injury, we studied how expression of c-KIT on <b>tubular</b> epithelium and its ligand SCF protect cells against apoptosis. Administration of SCF specific antisense oligonucleotides significantly decreased specific staining of SCF following ischemia. Reduced SCF expression resulted in impaired renal function, increased <b>tubular</b> damage and increased <b>tubular</b> epithelial apoptosis, independent of inflammation. In an in vitro hypoxia model, stimulation of <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells with SCF activated survival signaling and decreased apoptosis.
