5|$|Although a large {{horse is}} not {{required}} to carry an armoured knight, it is held by some historians <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> horse was desirable to increase the power of a lance strike. However, practical experiments by re-enactors have suggested that the rider's weight and strength is of more relevance than the size of the mount, and that little of the horse's weight is translated to the lance.|$|E

5|$|A {{turning point}} came in 1777 when British forces invaded New York from Canada and laid siege to Patriots in Fort Stanwix. In August, when Brant learned <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> body of Patriot militia {{was on its}} way to relieve the fort, she sent Mohawk runners to alert the British {{commander}} of the danger. This information enabled a British, Mohawk, and Seneca force to ambush the Patriots and their Oneida allies in the Battle of Oriskany. The Iroquois were divided in their loyalties. The Oneida allied with the Patriots, while most bands of the other four nations allied with the British. After this battle, in which Iroquois warriors of these nations fought on both sides, the war in the Mohawk Valley became particularly brutal. The Oneida and rebel Americans retaliated against Brant by pillaging Canajoharie. Brant fled with her children to Onondaga, the central city of the Iroquois Confederacy. Her departure was so precipitate that she had to leave most of her belongings behind.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{a debate}} about whether a country should {{introduce}} financial planning to develop itself or rely on private entrepreneurs emerged. Nurkse believed that the subject of who should promote development does not concern economists. It is an administrative problem. The crucial idea was <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> amount of well dispersed investment should {{be made in the}} economy, so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels, increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question. However, {{it should be noted that}} most economists who favoured the balanced growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates. Further, the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks.|$|E
5|$|After the Third Battle of Ypres petered out in late 1917, the Western Front {{fell into}} its usual lull {{over the winter}} months. In early 1918, it became {{apparent}} to the Allies <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> German offensive was pending. This Spring Offensive commenced on 21 March 1918, with over one million men in three German armies striking hard near the junction between the French and British armies. The main effort of this offensive hit the British Fifth Army, which formed the right flank of the British front line. Struck a staggering blow, it began a rapid and at times panicked withdrawal. The key railway junction at Amiens was soon threatened.|$|E

5|$|Although a 17-page {{petition}} with 298 signatures {{in favor}} of a public referendum was presented at the meeting, the board felt that OSI funds would not be available by the proposed November referendum. Opponents of the board's decision protested it by placing signs near the mountain deriding the purchase as an unwise expenditure. The town was not legally obligated to hold a referendum, regardless of public sentiment, because the money budgeted for the purchase was not borrowed; board members planned to tap a $340,000 surplus fund, generated by the 2010 sale of town land to the OSI, which intended to allow bouldering on the property. The $340,000 fund was originally intended for capital improvements, specifically {{the construction of a new}} town hall, but a June 2011 audit of the town's 2010 budget found <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> part of the surplus had already been used to offset budget and tax shortfalls; only $79,000 remained available.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method that}} has been used to {{establish}} the date of eruption is tree-ring dating. Tree-ring data has shown <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> event interfering with normal tree growth in North America occurred during 1629–1628 (±65 years)BCE. Evidence of a climatic event around 1628BCE has been found in studies of growth depression of European oaks in Ireland and of Scotch pines in Sweden. Bristlecone pine frost rings also indicate a date of 1627BCE, supporting the late 1600sBCE dating. Procedural changes in how ice cores are interpreted would bring that data more in line with the dendrochronological numbers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, in 1980, {{geologist}} Walter Alvarez and his father, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Luis Walter Alvarez, put forth his hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> extraterrestrial body had struck Earth. In 1981, unaware of Penfield's discovery, University of Arizona graduate student Alan R. Hildebrand and faculty adviser William V. Boynton published a draft Earth-impact theory and sought a candidate crater. Their evidence included greenish-brown clay with surplus iridium containing shocked quartz grains and small weathered glass beads that {{looked to be}} tektites. Thick, jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present, {{thought to have been}} scoured from one place and deposited elsewhere by a megatsunami resulting from an Earth impact. Such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the Caribbean basin at the K–Pg boundary. So when Haitian professor Florentine Morás discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on Haiti, Hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby impact. Tests on samples retrieved from the K–Pg boundary revealed more tektite glass, formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high-yield nuclear detonations.|$|E
