Collins was also rumored to be considering running for the U.S. Senate, a bid which never materialized following her husband's conviction.

5|$|The Tokyo Mew Mew manga {{series was}} well {{received}} by English-speaking audiences. In March and April 2003, {{the first volume}} sold an estimated 1,597 and 1,746 copies respectively. This put the volume at <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the top 50 sales for each month. By 2004, {{with most of the}} series released, it became a mild success for licensor Tokyopop. It was ranked number 16 on the list of Manga Top 50 for the first quarter of 2004 in the ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga, based on sales from both mainstream bookstores and comic book shops. Sales of the sixth and seventh volumes dropped slightly; however, both were among the top 100 best-selling graphic novels in March and May 2004. The first volume of Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode debuted 63rd on the list of top 100 best-selling graphic novels of May 2005, with nearly double the sales figures of the last volume of the main series. On the Nielsen Bookscan charts, the volume debuted at rank 39 before quickly climbing to the 14th spot. The second volume of à la Mode saw similar success, debuting in the 69th slot before advancing to the 12th position, a result of the Mew Mew Power show appearing on 4Kids TV.|$|E

25|$|In energy {{dispersive}} analysis, dispersion and detection are a single operation, {{as already mentioned}} above. Proportional counters or various types of solid-state detectors (PIN diode, Si(Li), Ge(Li), Silicon Drift Detector SDD) are used. They all share the same detection principle: An incoming X-ray photon ionises {{a large number of}} detector atoms with the amount of charge produced being proportional to the energy of the incoming photon. The charge is then collected and the process repeats itself for the next photon. Detector speed is obviously critical, as all charge carriers measured have to come from the same photon to measure the photon energy correctly (peak length discrimination is used to eliminate events that seem to have been produced by two X-ray photons arriving almost simultaneously). The spectrum is then built up by dividing the energy spectrum into discrete bins and counting the number of pulses registered within each energy bin. EDXRF detector types vary in resolution, speed and the means of cooling (a low number of free charge carriers is critical in the solid state detectors): proportional counters with resolutions of several hundred eV cover <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the performance spectrum, followed by PIN diode detectors, while the Si(Li), Ge(Li) and Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) occupy {{the high end of the}} performance scale.|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} {{of stem cells}} with their bone marrow microenvironment is a critical process in maintaining normal hematopoiesis. We applied an approach to resolve the spatial organization that underlies these interactions by evaluating the distribution of hematopoietic cell subsets along an in vivo Hoechst 33342 (Ho) dye perfusion gradient. Cells isolated from different bone marrow regions according to Ho fluorescence intensity contained the highest concentration of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) activity in <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ho gradient (i. e., in the regions reflecting diminished perfusion). Consistent with the ability of Ho perfusion to simulate the level of oxygenation, bone marrow fractions separately enriched for HSCs {{were found to be}} the most positive for the binding of the hypoxic marker pimonidazole. Moreover, the in vivo administration of the hypoxic cytotoxic agent tirapazamine exhibited selective toxicity to the primitive stem cell subset. These data collectively indicate that HSCs and the supporting cells of the stem cell niche are predominantly located at <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> an oxygen gradient in the bone marrow with the implication that regionally defined hypoxia plays a fundamental role in regulating stem cell function...|$|R
