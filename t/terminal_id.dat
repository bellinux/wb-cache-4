50|$|Using an {{extended}} code of 11 digits (if the receiving bank has assigned extended codes to branches or to processing areas) allows the payment {{to be directed}} to a specific office. For example: DEUTDEFF500 would direct the payment to an office of Deutsche Bank in Bad Homburg. SWIFT deviate slightly from the standard though by using position nine for a Logical <b>Terminal</b> <b>ID,</b> making their extended codes 12 digits long.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—EMV, {{also known}} as “Chip and PIN”, is the leading system for smartcard-based {{payments}} worldwide; it is widely deployed in Europe and is starting to be introduced in the USA too. It replaces the familiar mag-strip cards with chip cards. A cryptographic protocol is executed between a chip card and bank servers based on a message authentication code (MAC) over transaction data, including a nonce called the unpredictable number. We discovered two protocol flaws: first, {{the lack of a}} <b>terminal</b> <b>ID</b> to identify involved parties, and second that the nonce is not generated by the relying party. Together, these make EMV vulnerable to the pre-play attack: pre-recorded transaction data from a target card can be replayed at a future location. This powerful attack can be exploited due to weak random number generators, by a man-in-the-middle betwee...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} {{to the details of}} the input variables used for constructing the input feature vector for training the random forests algorithm, Table  1 also shows the variable importance of each input feature obtained by applying the random forests’ property, to observe its dependence on the output variable in the training dataset. From the table, it can be observed that the index of the selected receive filter beam is the most important variable that influences the value of the output variable. This is because the output variable, the MCS selection, is tied to the SINR value of the given terminal n for a given time instance t, which is highly dependent on the receive filter selected to serve the user n. The terminal position is the next most important variable, which itself indicates the expected interference level seen by terminal n when served by a selected transmit beam and receive filter combination by an RRH. The interfering beam indices also considerably influence the output variable, since they are also important in deciding the level of interference seen by terminal n at time t. The assigned <b>terminal</b> <b>ID</b> is the least important parameter, since it only indicates the terminal considered for a given sample instance, and is loosely tied to the output variable, i.e., the MCS selected for serving the indicated terminal.|$|E

50|$|Gingermaster: A trojan {{developed}} for an Android platform that propagates by installing applications that incorporate a hidden malware for installation in the background. It exploits the frailty in the version Gingerbread (2.3) {{of the operating}} system to use super-user permissions by privileged escalation. It then creates a service that steals information from infected <b>terminals</b> (user <b>ID,</b> number SIM, phone number, IMEI, IMSI, screen resolution and local time) by sending it to a remote server through petitions HTTP.|$|R

50|$|On a Unix or Unix-like system, a {{background}} process or job {{can be further}} identified as one whose process group ID differs from its <b>terminal</b> group <b>ID</b> (TGID). (The TGID of a process is the process ID of the process group leader that opened the terminal, which is typically the login shell. The TGID identifies the control terminal of the process group.) This type of process is unable to receive keyboard signals from its parent terminal, and typically will not send output to that terminal. This more technical definition does not distinguish between {{whether or not the}} process can receive user intervention. Although background processes are typically used for purposes needing few resources, any process can be run in the background, and such a process will behaves like any other process, with the exceptions given above.|$|R

The game also features an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of the}} game. On every floor, the player can access to the computer <b>terminal</b> with an <b>ID</b> Card and a Record Card in their possession. ID cards are used to reveal unexplored parts of the floor, while Record Cards hold pre-recorded messages that can be read with the terminal. At certain points in the game, the player can also acquire Armor ROMs to enhance the suit's defense system, which reduces damage from enemy attacks.|$|R
50|$|An orange box is a {{piece of}} {{hardware}} or software that generates caller ID frequency-shift keying (FSK) signals to spoof caller ID information on the target's caller <b>ID</b> <b>terminal.</b> It takes advantage of call waiting caller ID (also called off-hook caller ID) by mimicking the phone company's central office equipment and sending the call waiting tone followed by the audible caller ID data. An orange box {{can also be used to}} spoof Caller ID information sent after an incoming call rings, if the user has direct access to the target's phone line. One proposal to accomplish this involves an orange box used in conjunction with a magenta box, which in combination is called a vermilion box.|$|R
50|$|DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing) is a {{tool for}} transparently {{checkpointing}} the state of an arbitrary group of programs spread across many machines and connected by sockets. It does not modify the user's program or the operating system. Among the applications supported by DMTCP are Open MPI, Python, Perl, and many programming languages and shell scripting languages. With the use of TightVNC, it can also checkpoint and restart X Window applications, {{as long as they}} do not use extensions (e.g. no OpenGL or video). Among the Linux features supported by DMTCP are open file descriptors, pipes, sockets, signal handlers, process id and thread id virtualization (ensure old pids and tids continue to work upon restart), ptys, fifos, process group <b>ids,</b> session <b>ids,</b> <b>terminal</b> attributes, and mmap/mprotect (including mmap-based shared memory). DMTCP supports the OFED API for InfiniBand on an experimental basis.|$|R
40|$|Interference {{alignment}} (IA) is {{a promising}} solution for interference management in wireless networks. On the other hand, simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) {{has become an}} emerging technique. Although some works have been done on IA and SWIPT, these two important areas have traditionally been addressed separately in the literature. In this paper, we propose to use a common framework to jointly study IA and SWIPT. We analyze the performance of SWIPT in IA networks. Specifically, we derive the upper bound of the power that can be harvested in IA networks. In addition, we show that, to improve the performance of wireless power transfer and information transmission, users should be dynamically selected as energy harvesting (EH) or information decoding (<b>ID)</b> <b>terminals.</b> Furthermore, we design two easy-implemented SWIPT-user selection (SWIPT-US) algorithms in IA networks. To optimize the ID and EH performance of SWIPT in IA networks, a power-splitting optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed when power splitters are available, and its closed-form optimal solutions are derived. Power allocation in the PSO algorithm is also studied to further optimize the performance. Simulation results are presented to show {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed algorithms...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{genome-wide}} screen {{had previously}} shown that knocking down miR- 98 and let- 7 g, two miRNAs of the let- 7 family, {{leads to a}} dramatic increase in terminal myogenic differentiation. In the present paper, we report that a transcriptomic analysis of human myoblasts, where miR- 98 was knocked down, revealed that approximately 240 genes were sensitive to miR- 98 depletion. Among these potential targets of miR- 98, we identified the transcriptional repressor E 2 F 5 and showed that it is a direct target of miR- 98. Knocking down simultaneously E 2 F 5 and miR- 98 almost fully restored normal differentiation, indicating that E 2 F 5 is involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle differentiation. We subsequently show that E 2 F 5 can bind to the promoters of two inhibitors of <b>terminal</b> muscle differentiation, <b>ID</b> 1 (inhibitor of DNA binding 1) and HMOX 1 (heme oxygenase 1), which decreases their expression in skeletal myoblasts. We conclude that miR- 98 regulates muscle differentiation by altering the expression of the transcription factor E 2 F 5 and, in turn, of multiple E 2 F 5 targets...|$|R
