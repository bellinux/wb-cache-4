Some people look to Hollywood, some people look to Blackpool and <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> Blackpool. That's probably where I would look.|$|E

Tunny realizes that his generation has been so numbed and apathetic that nothing, not even <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> the city, will excite him ("Are We the Waiting"). He enlists in the army.|$|E
500|$|Director Rebecca Thomas {{was raised}} as a Mormon. She first {{researched}} Mormon fundamentalism for a documentary, {{and the religious}} group portrayed in Electrick Children is based on this research. She {{wanted to write a}} film based on scripture and decided to adapt the story of the Virgin Mary. In writing the script, she drew from her own experience of growing up in Las Vegas and the conflict she perceived [...] "between the traditions of Mormon culture in Utah and <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> Las Vegas". She was also inspired by Pier Paolo Pasolini's [...] "nonjudgmental approach" [...] to religion in The Gospel According to St. Matthew. Thomas began writing the script in April 2011, after her second year of studying at the Columbia University School of the Arts.|$|E

2500|$|The Atlantic Ocean {{was a major}} {{strategic}} battle zone (the [...] "Battle of the Atlantic") {{and when}} Germany declared war on the U.S., the East Coast of the United States offered easy pickings for German U-boats (referred to as the [...] "Second Happy Time"). After a highly successful foray by five Type IX long-range U-boats, the offensive was maximized {{by the use of}} short-range Type VII U-boats, with increased fuel stores, replenished from supply U-boats called Milchkühe (milk cows). From February to May 1942, 348 ships were sunk, for the loss of two U-boats during April and May. U.S. naval commanders were reluctant to introduce the convoy system that had protected trans-Atlantic shipping and, without coastal blackouts, shipping was silhouetted against <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> American towns and cities such as Atlantic City until a dim-out was ordered in May.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effects of}} this early {{discrimination}} still linger a half-century later, as documented by the studies of the Adva Center, a think tank on social equality, and by other Israeli academic research (cf., for example, Tel Aviv University Professor Yehuda Shenhav's article in Hebrew documenting the gross under-representation of Sephardic Jewry in Israeli high school history textbooks.) All Israeli Prime Ministers have been Ashkenazi, although Sephardim and Mizrahim have attained high positions including ministerial positions, chief of staffs and presidency. The student bodies of Israel's universities remain overwhelmingly Ashkenazi in origin, {{despite the fact that}} roughly half the country's population is non-Ashkenazi. And the tent cities of the 1950s morphed into so-called [...] "development towns". Scattered over border areas of the Negev Desert and the Galilee, far from <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> Israel's major cities, most of these towns never had the critical mass or ingredients to succeed as places to live, and they continue to suffer from high unemployment, inferior schools, and chronic brain drain.|$|E
60|$|I {{never spoke}} with her again but once. That was an evening three years later in Brussels. Strolling idly after dinner <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> a theatre invited me to enter. It was {{somewhat}} late; the second act had commenced. I slipped quietly into my seat, the only one vacant at the extreme end of {{the front row of}} the first range; then, looking down upon the stage, met her eyes. A little later an attendant whispered to me that Madame G---- would like to see me; so at the fall of the curtain I went round. Two men were in the dressing-room smoking, and on the table were some bottles of champagne. She was standing before her glass, a loose shawl about her shoulders.|$|E

60|$|When {{he was so}} {{very nearly}} breathless as {{to be able to}} run no more, but was forced to walk, Toby looked behind him, and there he could see <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> the circus and hear the strains of the music as he had heard them on the night when he was getting ready to run away from Uncle Daniel; and those very sounds, which {{reminded}} him forcibly of how ungrateful he had been to the old man who had cared for him when {{there was no one else}} in the world who would do so, made it more easy for him to leave those behind who had been so kind to him when he stood so much in need of kindness.|$|E
6000|$|At length {{they were}} {{descending}} the long low hill, or rather undulation, {{leading to the}} wooded vale of Lynwood, and <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> the Keep began to gleam like stars in the darkness--stars indeed to the eager eyes of the young Knight, who gazed upon them long and affectionately, as he felt himself once more at home. [...] "I wonder," [...] said he, [...] "to see the light strongest towards {{the east end of}} the Castle! I knew not that the altar lights in the chapel could be seen so far!" [...] Then riding on more quickly, and approaching more nearly, he soon lost sight of them behind the walls, and descending the last little rising ground, the lofty mass of building rose huge and black before him.|$|E
60|$|Lord St. Maurice {{was in a}} {{good humor}} with himself and the entire world that night. He had spent nearly {{the whole of the}} day with the woman he loved, and whom he was shortly to marry, and with the {{prospect}} of another such day on the morrow, even his temporary exile from paradise was not a very severe trial. He was an ardent suitor, and deeply in love, but an hour or two alone with a case of excellent cigars, with delightful thoughts to keep him company, the softest air in Europe to breathe, {{and one of the most}} picturesque sights to look upon, could scarcely be esteemed a hardship. Above him, among the woods, twinkled <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> the Villa Fiolesse which he had just quitted, and below was the gay little Marina, still dotted about with groups of men in soft hats and light clothes, and bright-eyed, laughing women, whose musical voices rang out on the still night air with strange distinctness.|$|E
6000|$|Mechanically she obeyed; {{mechanically}} {{she looked}} down where his finger was pointing.

[...] branded on the villain's shoulder! ...|$|R

60|$|It {{was perhaps}} nearly nine at night; he had eaten nothing since lunch, he had drunk a good deal, {{and he was}} {{exhausted}} by emotion, when the thought of Houston came into his head. He turned, not merely to the man as a friend, but to his house {{as a place of}} refuge. The danger that threatened him was still so vague, that he knew neither what to fear nor where he might expect it; but this much at least seemed undeniable, that a private house was safer than a public inn. Moved by these counsels, he turned at once to the Caledonian Station, passed (not without alarm) into <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> the approach, redeemed his portmanteau from the cloak-room, and was soon whirling in a cab along the Glasgow road. The change of movement and position, the sight of the lamps twinkling to the rear, and the smell of damp and mould and rotten straw which clung about the vehicle, wrought in him strange alternations of lucidity and mortal giddiness.|$|E
6000|$|Forthwith, {{the sailors}} crowded round {{them in a}} hollow square. Muriel and Felix, half faint with relief from their long and anxious suspense, {{staggered}} slowly down the seaward path between them. But {{there was no need}} now for further show of defence. The islanders, pressing near and flinging away their weapons, followed the procession close, with tears and lamentations. As they went on, the women, rushing out of their huts while the fugitives passed, tore their hair on their heads, and beat their breasts in terror. The warriors who had come from the shore recounted, with their own exaggerative additions, the miracle of the six-shooter and the dynamite cartridge. Gradually they approached the landing-place on the beach. There the third officer sat waiting in the gig to receive them. The lamentations of the islanders now became positively poignant. [...] "Oh, my father," [...] they cried aloud, [...] "my brother, my revered one, you are indeed the true Tu-Kila-Kila. Do not go away like this and desert us! Oh, our mother, great queen, mighty goddess, stop with us! Take not away your sun from the heavens, nor your rain from the crops. We acknowledge we have sinned; we have done very wrong; but the chief sinner is dead; the wrong-doer has paid; spare us who remain; spare us, great deity; do not make <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> heaven become dark over us. Stay with your worshippers, and we will give you choice young girls to eat every day, we will sacrifice the tenderest of our children to feed you." ...|$|E
