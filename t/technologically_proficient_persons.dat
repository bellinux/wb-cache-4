Computers, like pencils and notebooks, have {{become an integral part of}} the college experience. In the last five years there has been an emerging national trend to require laptop computers for accounting majors as well as in other disciplines. A laptop computer requirement can be extremely beneficial to accounting majors. While courses in accounting information systems have typically required students to gain hands-on experience using software such as Microsoft Access, Peachtree, QuickBooks, Great Plains and others, incorporation of technology into the other accounting courses has generally been more limited and has varied from programme to programme. The implementation of a laptop requirement necessitates a thorough analysis of the entire accounting curriculum and should result in the incorporation of information technology in all accounting courses. This also requires that faculty become <b>technologically</b> <b>proficient</b> and thus able to incorporate the laptop use into the curriculum so that the value of the laptop computer is realized.

Lack of access toward becoming a digital citizen can be a serious drawback, since many elementary procedures such as tax reports filing, birth registration, and use of Web sites to support candidates in political campaigns (E-democracy) etc. have been transferred to only be available via the Internet.

40|$|AbstractThe {{increasing}} {{importance of}} computers in today‚Äôs world forces teachers and educators to become technology-proficient teachers, {{and to make}} use of technology in the classroom practices. All over the world most countries acknowledging the need for <b>technologically</b> <b>proficient</b> teachers, have started to infuse some degree of technological competency into pre-service teacher training programmes. Turkey was not an exception. The Turkish Ministry of National Education (MoNE) has started to promote computer use within schools, through policy, and through the provision of computers and professional development (Akkoyunlu, 2002; Rosaen, Hobson, & Khan, 2003; Cohen & Tally, 2004). The Council of Higher Education (HEC) has responded to these initiatives by integrating technology into teacher education programmes. However, like in many other countries several problems have been encountered in the implementation of technology (Salaberry, 2001; Asan, 2003; √áakƒ±roglu & Cakƒ±roglu, 2003; √ñzden, 2007). Among several other problems prospective teachers‚Äô attitudes towards technology is the most important one (Gunter, 2001; Johnson & Howell, 2005). Given the significance this study investigated the attitudes of pre-service TEFL teachers toward technology. A twelve item 5 -point Likert scale questionnaire was used to collect data from a sample of 200 TEFL Certificate programme students in a state university in Istanbul.

Although the requirements in the workplace have been changing over the years, entry into the 21 st century labor force demands that the schools keep pace with these changes, {{many of which have}} resulted in curriculum reform. The United States Department of Education has concluded that it is crucial for teachers to be <b>technologically</b> <b>proficient</b> if they are to meet the students 2 ÃÜ 7 needs. The obligation to be better informed about effective uses of technology has, therefore, become a priority of the United States Congress and many state legislatures. State education departments and school districts have established new goals to assure that students learn specific skills and competencies. The goal {{of this study was to}} enable high school teachers to infuse online components into the coursework using constructivist theory. The process by which this goal was achieved was through the development of HSTOR-E (High School Teachers 2 ÃÜ 7 Online Resource Environment), an online community where, during the fall semester of 2003, high school teachers acclimated themselves to the online atmosphere for learning. While being mentored, sharing their ideas and knowledge with other participants, and using online primary source American history documents, they expanded their knowledge base and learned to infuse technology into their coursework appropriately.

40|$|Leadership is an {{extensively}} {{discussed and}} researched concept in scholarship. A {{vast amount of}} literature focuses on adult leadership, especially in a political and organizational context. Adult leadership places emphasis {{on the role of}} individual leaders, whilst youth leadership takes a participatory approach. Leadership scholars indicate that this participatory approach to youth leadership, involves young people addressing community concerns and at a civic level, engaging in planning and decision-making. Social participation traits and civic identity are developed during adolescence yet very little research has been undertaken in this area since the 1960 s. This suggests that youth leadership is an overlooked research stream. Current studies on Gen Y indicate that this demographic are <b>technologically</b> <b>proficient</b> especially with regard to Web 2. 0 tools, but also disengaged from their community. This research project examines the use of online communities to influence the leadership skills of a Gen Y cohort in the context of social participation and civic engagement. In this study a focus group and an online wiki were used to investigate how Gen Y teenagers in Wellington, New Zealand used online communities to develop and exercise their leadership skills through civic and social action endeavours. Results from the study indicate that youth leadership, in an online context, centres on the role of organisers who foster civic participation through online community networks. Thus youth leadership is strengthened through participation in civic and community issues using online communities. Adult perceptions of youth and the low credibility of online communities, as perceived by youth, were found to act as barriers to online youth leadership. The findings highlight the importance of adults acknowledging youth in social participation and civic endeavours. This study extends research in the youth leadership stream and enhances our understanding of Gen Y and their use of online communities...|$|R
40|$|Crop {{production}} contributes {{for about}} 92 % {{of the food}} needs of humanity (Borlaug 2002). The unprecedented crop yield increases from the Green Revolution varieties have dramatically improved the level of food supply particularly to the world‚Äôs poor since the 1960 s. The roots of such crop yield increases lie in {{the advent of the}} science of genetics in the early 20 th century. Genetics continues to provide the knowledge base for the recombination of agronomic traits of economic importance through plant breeding. In recent decades, the incremental understanding of the molecular basis of genetics and associated sciences has yielded powerful tools and techniques collectively termed as biotechnology. Advances in biotechnology offer opportunities to improve crop productivity and to enhance crop product quality. Increased yields mean reduced environmental degradation brought about by agricultural land expansion, which is a common feature of African farming systems. In crop agriculture, biotechnology encompasses the production of genetically modified crops, micropropagation, marker assisted breeding, genomics and bioinformatics (DeVries and Toenniessen 2001). Of all these, advances in genetic modification came along with uncertainties this technology might entail on biodiversity, human health and socio-economic development. Cognizant of these potentials and pitfalls, Agenda 21 (Chapter 16) of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) detailed program of action to create enabling conditions, including technology transfer, for the safe application of biotechnology for sustainable development particularly in developing countries.

40|$|Originally, the Internet was a {{technological}} playground, a collaborative endeavor among researchers who shared the common goal of achieving communication. Self-interest {{used not to}} be a concern, but the motivations of the Internet's participants have broadened. Today, the Internet consists of millions of commercial entities and nearly 2 billion users, who often have conflicting goals. For example, while Facebook gives users the illusion of access control, users do not have the ability to control how the personal data they upload is shared or sold by Facebook. Even in BitTorrent, where all users seemingly have the same motivation of downloading a file as quickly as possible, users can subvert the protocol to download more quickly without giving their fair share. These examples demonstrate that protocols that are merely <b>technologically</b> <b>proficient</b> are not enough. Successful networked systems must account for potentially competing interests. In this dissertation, I demonstrate how to build systems that give users incentives to follow the systems' protocols. To achieve incentive-compatible systems, I apply mechanisms from game theory and auction theory to protocol design. This approach has been considered in prior literature, but unfortunately has resulted in few real, deployed systems with incentives to cooperate. I identify the primary challenge in applying mechanism design and game theory to large-scale systems: the goals and assumptions of economic mechanisms often do not match those of networked systems. For example, while auction theory may assume a centralized clearing house, there is no analog in a decentralized system seeking to avoid single points of failure or centralized policies. Similarly, game theory often assumes that each player is able to observe everyone else's actions, {{or at the very least}} know how many other players there are, but maintaining perfect system-wide information is impossible in most systems. In other words, not all incentive mechanisms are systems-compatible. The main contribution of this dissertation is the design, implementation, and evaluation of various systems-compatible incentive mechanisms and their application to a wide range of deployable systems. These systems include BitTorrent, which is used to distribute a large file to a large number of downloaders, PeerWise, which leverages user cooperation to achieve lower latencies in Internet routing, and Hoodnets, a new system I present that allows users to share their cellular data access to obtain greater bandwidth on their mobile devices. Each of these systems represents a different point in the design space of systems-compatible incentives. Taken together, along with their implementations and evaluations, these systems demonstrate that systems-compatibility is crucial in achieving practical incentives in real systems. I present design principles outlining how to achieve systems-compatible incentives, which may serve an even broader range of systems than considered herein. I conclude this dissertation with what I consider to be the most important open problems in aligning the competing interests of the Internet's participants...|$|R

As language access rises in importance ‚Äì within the government as a whole, and the legal system in particular ‚Äì law schools have begun to develop strategies to promote language access within the academy. These strategies serve multiple purposes: to prepare students to identify, and respond to, issues of language difference in the context of legal work; to ensure that the policies and practices of law schools comply with language access norms; and to foment student awareness and advocacy on language access, as a key social justice issue. Indeed, educating future lawyers involves not just teaching law students how to read a case, interview a client or draft a brief, it also includes introducing them to the numerous ways lawyers seek to participate in and improve the justice system. Promoting language access in the legal academy offers numerous opportunities to expose students to a diverse set of organizations and skills, and to a community of advocates who have engaged on these issues.

The investigation was undertaken using four constructs of the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge framework: Technological Knowledge (TK), Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK), Technological Content Knowledge (TCK), and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). A mixed methods approach was adopted to probe eight research questions in two phases. The first phase was the completion of the TK and TPACK surveys by teachers (n = 173) from 12 secondary schools and pre-service teachers (n = 53) from two campuses of the University of Trinidad and Tobago. The second phase consisted of a series of one-on-one, semi-structured interviews for in-service teachers (n = 21), pre-service teachers (n = 15), ICT technicians (n = 5), school supervisors (n = 3), and the Director of the eConnect and Learn program (n = 1). Statistical analyses with SPSS revealed {{there was a significant difference}} between in-service and pre-service teachers‚Äô confidence to integrate ICT for teaching and student learning. Final year pre-service teachers studying for an undergraduate degree were more confident in the integration of ICT than the in-service teachers. Teaching experience and qualification also impacted on teachers‚Äô TK, TPK/TCK, and TPACK scores. Teachers with less than 10 years of teaching experience as well as pre-service teachers had higher mean TK, TPK/TCK, and TPACK scores than teachers who were employed in secondary schools for more than 10 years. As part of the research, a comparison was made of the TPACK scores between pre-service teachers from an Australian University and the University of Trinidad and Tobago. Australian pre-service teachers had higher mean scores in five out of 20 TPACK items. In contrast, the Trinidad and Tobago pre-service teachers had a higher mean score in one item. Overall, both cohorts demonstrated a high level of consistency in their confidence to use ICT and support students‚Äô use of ICT in 14 items of the survey. The qualitative interview data were analysed using a modified form of coding strategies from grounded theory and thematic approach supported by NVIVO. Four common themes were identified: teacher support; challenges of the eConnect and Learn program; pedagogy with computers and related devices; and implications for the future of the program. Teachers perceived factors such as insufficient professional development, inadequate resources, inappropriate infrastructure, and lack of time for collaboration reduced the full implementation of the eConnect and Learn program. The eight stages of the Levels of Teaching Innovation model developed by Moersch (2010) were used to review and interpret Trinidad and Tobago teachers‚Äô pedagogical practices with computers and related devices. The majority of the teachers‚Äô responses occurred at the Awareness Level (Level 1) where teachers utilised mainly PowerPoint and videos. Few responses occurred at the higher levels. The study concludes with the conceptualisation of a Learning Environment Model aligned with the Levels of Teaching Innovation and the seven constructs of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge. It is contended this framework provides a greater understanding on how to facilitate teachers‚Äô ability to integrate and evaluate technology integration for 21 st Century teaching and learning in the classroom. Thus, this framework has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of how teachers can assist students to become more <b>technologically</b> <b>proficient</b> especially with eLearning which is important for the current and future knowledge economy...|$|R
40|$|The {{staff at}} the University of North Dakota Health Sciences Library has {{continuously}} done outreach to North Dakota Indian reservation communities {{for the past four}} years. Funding was from the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) Greater Midwest Region subcontracts and training grants. Description of Projects: 1. Consumer Health Subcontract March 2002 ‚ÄîSeptember 2003 focusing on tribal college librarians and users of North Dakota‚Äôs five tribal college libraries. The project trained librarians, purchased computers for libraries, purchased a subscription to a full-text health database, and developed a web site, Linking Native Americans to Health Information 2. Training grant, August 2003, trained Fort Berthold Reservation Community Health Representatives (CHRs) to access health information on the Internet, and served as a pilot project for the Outreach to Health Professionals Subcontract. 3. Outreach to Health Professionals Subcontract, April 2004 ‚Äì December 2005 had three objectives: a. Train reservation health care providers. b. Reinforce, strengthen, and maintain a working relationship with the tribal college librarians. c. Expand the Linking Native Americans to Health Information web site. Challenges and effective practices: 1. Priorities are different for tribal college librarians. They have severe time constraints. Being patient and consistent are important. 2. There are often technology limitations. Although Internet access and equipment in tribal colleges are often very good, the librarians may not be <b>technologically</b> <b>proficient</b> nor have control over their Web pages. Directly approaching the colleges‚Äô IT staffs about adding links is an option. 3. Determining IP ranges was difficult. Some colleges contract with local Internet providers, while others use the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Each case must be approached on an individual basis. The librarians often had little knowledge of their systems, and it was effective to contact the IT staff directly. 4. There were cultural considerations in approaching the colleges and the health care providers. Learning as much as possible about health issues and communication styles was helpful. Training materials focusing on the group‚Äôs health problems is appreciated. 5. When doing outreach to the health providers, especially IHS staff, scheduling time for training was difficult. Either the administrative officer or the medical director is the best contact, but the demands on both are many. The IHS facilities are hectic, and they are reluctant to make time for training. 6. Selling the value of the training to the IHS facilities was difficult. At the IHS facilities, physicians rely on Up-To-Date and Micromedex. Many are not doing ‚Äúresearch,‚Äù so PubMed was not important. The counter to resistance is to be persistent and flexible. Introductory in-person visits proved helpful in some cases. 7. When working with the tribal health departments, making the right contact can be difficult. Once a contact is found, they are often more receptive to training than IHS. Having an advocate who promotes the advantages of training and provides assistance in making arrangements, is most effective. 8. Be wary of tribal politics. If there is unrest politically, tribal health personnel are reluctant to make any commitments. Relax and wait until later. This project is supported under contract no. NO 1 -LM- 1 - 3514 with the NN/LM MidContinental Region from the National Library of Medicine.
