25|$|Research {{shows that}} {{children}} from lower-income households who get good-quality pre-Kindergarten education {{are more likely}} <b>to</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>from</b> <b>high</b> school, attend college, hold a job and have higher earnings. In 2010, the U.S. ranked 28th out of 38 advanced countries in the share of four-year-olds enrolled in public or private early childhood education. Gains in enrollment stalled after 2010, as did growth in funding, due to budget cuts arising from the Great Recession. Per-pupil spending in state-funded programs declined by 12% after inflation since 2010. The U.S. differs from other countries in that it funds public education primarily through sub-national (state and local) taxes. The quality of funding for public education varies based on the tax base of the school system, with significant variation in local taxes and spending per pupil. Better teachers also raise the educational attainment and future earnings of students, {{but they tend to}} migrate to higher income school districts. Among developed countries, 70% of 3-year-olds go to preschool, versus 38% in the United States.|$|E

25|$|The mean {{onset of}} social phobia is 10 to 13 years. Onset after age 25 is rare and is {{typically}} preceded by panic disorder or major depression. Social anxiety disorder occurs {{more often in}} females than males. The prevalence of social phobia appears to be increasing among white, married, and well-educated individuals. As a group, those with generalized social phobia are less likely <b>to</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>from</b> <b>high</b> school {{and are more likely}} to rely on government financial assistance or have poverty-level salaries. Surveys carried out in 2002 show the youth of England, Scotland, and Wales have a prevalence rate of 0.4 percent, 1.8 percent, and 0.6 percent, respectively. In Canada, the prevalence of self-reported social anxiety for Nova Scotians older than 14 years was 4.2 percent in June 2004 with women (4.6 percent) reporting more than men (3.8 percent). In Australia, social phobia is the 8th and 5th leading disease or illness for males and females between 15–24 years of age as of 2003. Because of the difficulty in separating social phobia from poor social skills or shyness, some studies have a large range of prevalence. The table also shows higher prevalence in Sweden.|$|E
