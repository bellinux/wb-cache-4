Hers was the first widely available recording of the song.|$|E
50|$|For his film, {{director}} Jacques Demy {{wanted a}} band that captured the vibe of Los Angeles as he saw it. After hearing Spirit perform in an L.A. club, he decided {{that they would be}} the perfect group for his film's soundtrack. However, the film itself was considered a failure and no soundtrack album was released at the time. Most of the material remained unreleased until 2005, following the discovery of a master <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> mono mixes.|$|E

50|$|After the {{war ended}} in 1945, the cave would remain {{untouched}} for a long time, while several locals frequently visited it. Little was done until 1990, when a memorial was built outside the cave. At the same time, a wooden platform and sitting area was constructed, to allow memorial events and services to be held, {{as well as providing}} sitting for tourists and other visitors. A reel-to-reel audio tape detailing the story of the cave was also opened, but destroyed by vandals only two years later, with the tapes and player being stolen. A secondary <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> recording was discovered in 2008, and promptly digitalized. It was then played {{for the first time in}} over fifteen years during the annual memorial service at the cave.|$|E
5000|$|In 1986, [...] "Irresistible" [...] was remixed and {{released}} {{again as a}} single. For the new version, Harley worked with recording engineer Stuart Breed at Air Studios in London. Breed had come to Harley's attention through Mickie Most, who knew of his work. For the remix, the pair used the original 1985 recording on a 2" [...] Master tape. Harley and Breed mixed-and-matched parts of the track, and experimented with equipment. The song ended up being sped-up and dramatically altered from its original form. The 1985 version's guitar solo {{was replaced by a}} keyboard solo, which had been recorded during the original sessions with Most. The vocals used were from a different take, taken from the original 24-track 2" [...] <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> 1985 sessions.|$|E
5000|$|Each week, 3 {{families}} {{would get a}} chance to win fabulous prizes from Cilla's [...] "Dream Directory". These would typically be cars, holidays, televisions etc. and each member of the family would pick a prize that they wanted. However, to earn the prize, one member of the family, usually Mum or Dad but occasionally an older child, has to perform a very tricky task. They are given seven days to practice it, but when they arrive at the studio the next week they have one chance (and one chance only) to get it [...] "right on the night". If they do, they win the prizes they chose. If they don't, they lose the prizes they chose. Unlike the original show, if the nominated family member fails in the task then the younger children are given a consolation prize appropriate for this (this was included at the insistence of Cilla Black after she watched a <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> Japanese version, and was upset to see [...] "kiddies crying because the bikes they thought they'd won were being taken away").|$|E

Recent discovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stereo master <b>tapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> session, with an extra 25 minutes of music, is featured on the limited 1500 unit special edition Legend CD 32 DLX, released July, 2010, as a 26-track 74:34 CD.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, Roy Orbison re-recorded 19 of his {{greatest}} hits {{as a gift to}} his fans. <b>The</b> master <b>tapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> recordings were being legally held by Monument Records after the label went bankrupt in the late 1970s. Many of Orbison’s famous songs were not available to consumers for a few years and there was a threat to destroy the tapes if disputes were not resolved. Fearing his famous songs would be lost forever, Orbison stepped into the studio and performed them once again. This was his first album with Virgin Records.|$|R
50|$|In 1999 a straight-to-video movie {{entitled}} Tusenårsfesten ('The Millennium Party') was released, {{bringing together}} {{the main characters}} from both Mot i brøstet and Karl & Co (with <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> Trine). It explained how Nils and Trine now had four children, triplet boys and a girl, and still lived in Elna's old apartment. Henry and Elna were still in Spain, running their Norwegian restaurant, while Målfrid had gotten engaged to an African doctor in her new job. It had its TV premiere on TV 2 in 2001, and was re-released on DVD in 2007, albeit both of these in a heavily edited form, which has caused <b>the</b> VHS <b>tapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> cut to become highly attractive to fans.The VHS version is 56 minutes, while the TV/DVD version is edited to two 24 minute-episodes, cutting a total of 11 minutes from <b>the</b> <b>original</b> version.|$|R
5000|$|Young {{appeared}} on the podcast WTF with Marc Maron to promote the album.

Shortly after, the Individual Thought Patterns album was reissued. In February 2012, Relapse Records released a 2 CD live album entitled Vivus! that included the previously released 1998 concerts Live in L.A. and Live in Eindhoven, including liner notes by drummer Christy and manager/lawyer Greif. The Relapse deal does not include Death's acclaimed 1995 album Symbolic, whose rights are still retained by Roadrunner Records as of 2008.|$|R
50|$|The {{orchestra}} {{was established}} in 1990 by an Act of Congress with an appropriation to <b>the</b> Smithsonian Institution <b>of</b> $242,000. It was founded by Gunther Schuller and David Baker and began performing in 1991. The inaugural season, jointly conducted by Schuller and Baker, consisted of six weekends of free concerts for which the conductors collected or commissioned transcriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> arrangements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> works to be presented and provided the orchestra's members with <b>tapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> performances. Since that time, the SJMO has performed in nine foreign countries and 26 US states in addition to numerous free concerts in Washington, DC. Among their performances outside their base at <b>the</b> National Museum <b>of</b> American History have been a performance at the White House in 1993 celebrating <b>the</b> 40th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Newport Jazz Festival; the Cultural Olympiad at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia; and a 1999 tour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States presenting concerts in tribute to <b>the</b> 100th anniversary <b>of</b> Duke Ellington's birth which included a performance at the Monterey Jazz Festival in a concert featuring Ellington's Suite Thursday, originally commissioned for the festival.|$|R
50|$|The Winterland 1973 concerts were {{recorded}} on two-channel analog tapes, using a Nagra IV reel-to-reel tape recorder.

5000|$|From 1965 to 1968 Karen, {{her brother}} Richard and his college friend Wes Jacobs, a bassist and tuba player, formed the Richard Carpenter Trio. The band played jazz at {{numerous}} nightclubs and also {{appeared on the}} TV talent show Your All-American College Show. Karen, Richard and other musicians, including Gary Sims and John Bettis, also performed as an ensemble known as Spectrum. Spectrum focused on a harmonious and vocal sound and recorded many demo tapes in <b>the</b> garage studio <b>of</b> friend and bassist Joe Osborn. Many <b>of</b> those <b>tapes</b> were rejected by record companies. According to former Carpenters member John Bettis, those rejections [...] "took their toll." [...] <b>The</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> sessions were lost in a fire at Joe Osborn's house and <b>the</b> surviving versions <b>of</b> those early songs exist only as fragile acetate reference discs. Finally A&M Records signed the Carpenters to a recording contract in 1969. Karen sang most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs on the band's first album, Offering (later retitled Ticket to Ride), and her brother wrote 10 out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album's 13 songs. The issued single (later the title track), which was a cover of a Beatles song, became their first single; it reached #54 on the Billboard Hot 100. Their next album, 1970's Close to You, featured two massive hit singles: [...] "(They Long to Be) Close to You" [...] and [...] "We've Only Just Begun". They peaked at #1 and #2, respectively, on the Hot 100.|$|R

50|$|In {{the least}} {{offensive}} manner, one person would bring over their VCR to <b>tape</b> from that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> pirate, {{a process that}} would go on until <b>the</b> <b>original</b> copy had become worn due to overuse or until said film would become available on commercial home video often several {{months to a year}} later.

For school districts in affluent areas, these would even record right back onto the same 2-inch or 1-inch studio videotape formats from which <b>the</b> <b>original</b> broadcast emanated.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{he could}} only produce the tapes during periods in which his guards were absent, <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> {{recording}} <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> took over a year.

5000|$|Shields {{has been}} outspoken about the {{corporate}} {{influence in the}} music industry. He has said that Sony Music Entertainment, upon inheriting My Bloody Valentine from Creation Records, deliberately hid <b>the</b> master <b>tapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band's <b>original</b> recordings {{in an attempt to}} delay <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> EP's 1988-1991 (2012). Shields threatened to involve Scotland Yard in the dispute and then said the tapes [...] "magically, suddenly reappeared." [...] He has since called for reorganisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> record industry, which he has referred to as [...] "sociopathic". As a result, My Bloody Valentine's third album, m b v (2013), was an independent-self release. Reflecting on his decision, Shields said it was [...] "great to release the record without any industry interaction at all, but it also meant that it was a bit too expensive to buy, so we're {{going to try to make}} it cheaper by working with various record companies in the future", though ruling out agreements with major labels. In 2013, following <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> m b v, he accused <b>the</b> organisers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mercury Prize <b>of</b> [...] "banning" [...] the album for the nominated shortlist. In an interview with The Guardian, Shields said My Bloody Valentine were [...] "banned by Mercury Prize" [...] due to not having a major digital distribution deal in the United Kingdom. He added [...] "because we're not on Amazon or iTunes ... it's not a real record. Our album's not a real album because it's independent. The corporateness has got to such a point where we've essentially been told that we don't exist." ...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{assessment}} <b>of</b> clam yield {{potential and}} <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> suitable sites for clam rearing are a necessary step {{to improve the}} economic and environmental sustainability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exploitation activities in a regulated fishery. We discuss the development, validation and application of a method for estimating the clam yield potential of a northern Adriatic lagoon (Sacca di Goro, Italy) by combining logistic and ordinary regression. Clam yield potential was derived on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> six environmental parameters, namely sediment type, dissolved oxygen, salinity, hydrodynamism, water depth and chlorophyll "a". Density data were positively skewed and contained a substantial proportion of zero values due to <b>the</b> patchy-distribution <b>of</b> <b>Tapes</b> philippinarum. <b>The</b> <b>original</b> data set was divided in two parts: one indicating if T. philippinarum was present or not and the other indicating <b>the</b> abundance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species when it was present. The presence data was modelled by using logistic regression and the abundance data was separately modelled by using ordinary regression. The two models were then combined to identify suitable sites, to compute the expected clam yield potential in the Goro lagoon and to define <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> each environmental parameter in determining clam presence and abundance. The two-part model was then validated on a further data set (R 2 = 0. 87). Data on environmental parameters gathered in 15 sampling sites were interpolated via a nearest neighbour algorithm so as to derive maps of each environmental parameter for the whole lagoon. Finally, the two-part model was applied to derive <b>the</b> thematic maps <b>of</b> suitable sites for clam rearing and the corresponding yield potential. We claim that this reasonably rapid and cost-effective approach provides a rigorous framework for a fair partition of harvesting concessions among competitive users and for a substantial improvement <b>of</b> transparency in <b>the</b> decision-making process...|$|R
