40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: A common {{auditory}} {{complaint of}} multiple sclerosis patients, is misunderstanding {{speech in the}} presence of background noise. Evidence from animal and human studies has suggested that the medial olivocochlear bundle may {{play an important role in}} hearing noise. The medial olivocochlear bundle function can be evaluated by the suppression effect of <b>transient</b> otoacoustic <b>emission</b> in response to contralateral acoustic stimulation. The present study was conducted to investigate the suppression effect of <b>transient</b> otoacoustic <b>emission</b> in multiple sclerosis patients. Materials & Methods: This analytical case-control study was conducted on 34 multiple sclerosis patients (24 female, 10 male), aged 20 - 50 years and 34 controls matched for age and gender in Faculty of Rehabilitation, Tehran University of Medical Sciences in 2006. All cases were selected in simple random manner. The suppression effect of <b>transient</b> otoacoustic <b>emission</b> was evaluated by comparing the <b>transient</b> otoacoustic <b>emission</b> levels with and without contralateral acoustic stimulation.

40|$|Objectives: (1) To {{establish}} {{test performance}} measures for <b>Transient</b> Evoked Otoacoustic <b>Emission</b> testing of 6 -year-old {{children in a}} school setting; (2) To investigate whether <b>Transient</b> Evoked Otoacoustic <b>Emission</b> testing provides a more accurate and effective alternative to a pure tone screening plus tympanometry protocol. Methods: Pure tone screening, tympanometry and <b>transient</b> evoked otoacoustic <b>emission</b> {{data were collected from}} 940 subjects (1880 ears), {{with a mean age of}} 6. 2 years. Subjects were tested in non-sound-treated rooms within 22 schools. Receiver operating characteristics curves along with specificity, sensitivity, accuracy and efficiency values were determined for a variety of transient evoked otoacoustic emission/pure tone screening/tympanometry comparisons. Results: The <b>Transient</b> Evoked Otoacoustic <b>Emission</b> failure rate for the group was 20. 3 %. The failure rate for pure tone screening was found to be 8. 9 %, whilst 18. 6 % of subjects failed a protocol consisting of combined pure tone screening and tympanometry results. In essence, findings from the comparison of overall <b>Transient</b> Evoked Otoacoustic <b>Emission</b> pass/fail with overall pure tone screening pass/fail suggested that use of a modified Rhode Island Hearing Assessment Project criterion would result in a very high probability that a child with a pass result has normal hearing (true negative). However, the hit rate was only moderate. Selection of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) criterion set at ≥ 1 dB appeared to provide the best test performance measures for the range of SNR values investigated. Test performance measures generally declined when tympanometry results were included, with the exception of lower false alarm rates and higher positive predictive values. The exclusion of low frequency data from the <b>Transient</b> Evoked Otoacoustic <b>Emission</b> SNR versus pure tone screening analysis resulted in improved performance measures. Conclusions: The present study poses several implications for the clinical implementation of <b>Transient</b> Evoked Otoacoustic <b>Emission</b> screening for entry level school children. <b>Transient</b> Evoked Otoacoustic <b>Emission</b> pass/fail criteria will require revision. The findings of the current investigation offer support to the possible replacement of pure tone screening with <b>Transient</b> Evoked Otoacoustic <b>Emission</b> testing for 6 -year-old children. However, they do not suggest the replacement of the pure tone screening plus tympanometry battery. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
