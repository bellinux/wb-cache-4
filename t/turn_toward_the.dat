5|$|Late on December 29, {{more than}} four weeks after the {{official}} end to the season, a tropical disturbance developed in the east-central Atlantic. It quickly became more organized and was declared Tropical Depression Thirty on December 30. The next day, Thirty was declared a tropical storm naming it Zeta. Zeta made a <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> west but stalled and gradually weakened until dissipating on January 6, 2006.|$|E
5|$|While the Slaying of Goliath is a {{relatively}} simple composition with the two protagonists centrally placed and the only other figures being dimly seen observers, the Brazen Serpent picture is crowded with figures and separate incidents as the various individuals who have been attacked by snakes struggle and die or <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> icon that will save them. This is the most Mannerist of Michelangelo's earlier compositions at the Sistine Chapel, picking up the theme of human distress begun in the Great Flood scene and carrying it forward into the torment of lost souls in the Last Judgement, which was later painted below.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its size}} and {{electrical}} defenses, the marbled electric ray does not often fall prey to other animals such as sharks. This species exhibits different defensive behaviors depending on whether a prospective predator grasps it by the disc or the tail. A ray touched on the disc will quickly <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> threat while producing electric shocks; {{this is followed by}} it fleeing in a straight line, after which it may re-bury itself. A ray touched on the tail will propel itself upward into a loop; if it has not escaped after the maneuver, the ray will curl into a ring with the belly facing outward, so as to present the area of its body with the highest electric field gradient (the underside of the electric organs) towards the threat; these behaviors are accompanied by short, strong electric shocks. The ray tends to produce more electric bursts when protecting its tail than when protecting its disc.|$|E

As stated earlier in the article, this is in fact, not true. Modern Spiritualists often have art or jewelry with sunflower designs.|$|R
5|$|As {{early as}} August 10, {{computer}} models anticipated the hurricane to accelerate {{to the northeast}} and become extratropical within three days, but this did not materialize. A westerly trough that had been influencing Alberto’s motion outran the storm, and a strong ridge developed {{to the north and}} west, causing the storm to turn abruptly to the south on August 15, and to complete a large loop over the open Atlantic. Alberto turned to the southwest on August 16 and to the west on August 17. The storm then took a sharp <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northwest as a large, slow-moving mid-level trough was carving out over the eastern United States. Alberto began to strengthen, and reached hurricane status for the third time on August 18. The hurricane continued to turn to the north on August 19 and to the northeast on August 20 and August 21. During this time, Alberto reached a third peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h) on August 20, and a 70mi (110km) wide eye was observed. Operationally, Alberto reached a peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), but after reanalysis, it was reduced to 105mph (165km/h).|$|E
5|$|Hours after {{attaining}} {{its peak}} intensity, Fred began to weaken as clouds {{began to fill}} the eye. By this time, the hurricane was beginning to <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northwest as a subtropical ridge to the north weakened. Continued weakening took place as dry air started to erode convection along {{the southern edge of}} the system and the eye was no longer present on satellite imagery and wind shear also increased. Convection gradually became elongated in response to the shear and outflow was mostly restricted to the northeast region of the hurricane. By September10, the mid-level circulation center was displaced from the low-level circulation center. On September11, the convective pattern of Fred had no organized shape to it and the NHC downgraded the hurricane to a tropical storm. Unrelenting shear and dry air finally took their toll on September12. By that time, no deep convection was associated with the main circulation of Fred, leaving the center fully exposed. The storm degenerated into a remnant-low later that day, corresponding with the final advisory from the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

25|$|As {{the spur}} falling north from High Raise {{gradually}} narrows, the ground becomes rockier, until a sudden <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> east throws up a knuckle of crag.

From Sergeant's Crag the ridge drops slightly before reaching its terminus at Eagle Crag.|$|E
25|$|Such was {{the lack}} of warning that {{there was no time to}} engage in {{defensive}} manoeuvres, leading to a change in British policy whereby any Royal Navy vessel that suspected it might be under missile attack would <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> threat, accelerate to maximum speed and fire chaff to prevent a ship being caught defenceless again. The codeword used to start this procedure was 'handbrake', which had to be broadcast once the signal of the Agave radar of the Super Étendard was picked up.|$|E

25|$|The main {{forces in}} the Balkans in the 1345 were Serbia, Bulgaria, and the Byzantine Empire. Stefan Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia proclaimed himself Tsar of the new Serbian Empire and {{continued}} his efforts at expansion, quickly conquering Albania and other surrounding areas within the year. The Byzantines, though powerful, were {{in a state of}} decline, with an ongoing civil war between emperors John V Palaiologos and John VI Kantakouzenos, although in 1345, the tide began to <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> latter. At the same time, the Zealot commune in Thessalonica entered a more radical phase.|$|E
25|$|The {{run for the}} Torres Strait {{was going}} without {{incident}} until an unknown destroyer and freighter were spotted on the 17th headed {{in the opposite direction}} and then on 18 February Don Isidro was attacked twice by a Japanese bomber, though without damage. That attack was decisive in the captain's decision to <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> friendly port of Darwin. On the morning of the 19th seven Japanese fighters strafed the ship while she was about 25 miles north of Bathurst Island. This attack holed the ship, destroyed all life boats and rafts and wounded a number of crew and defenders. In early afternoon, at about 1:30 (1330) the ship was again attacked by a single bomber and again escaped bomb damage.|$|E
25|$|Originating from a {{tropical}} wave that emerged off Africa on September22, Matthew developed into {{a tropical}} storm {{just east of the}} Lesser Antilles on September28. It became a hurricane north of Venezuela and Colombia on September29, before undergoing explosive intensification, ultimately reaching Category5 intensity on October1 at just 13.4°N latitude – the lowest latitude ever recorded for a storm of this intensity in the Atlantic basin, breaking the record set by Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Matthew weakened slightly and fluctuated in intensity while making a northward <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Greater Antilles, remaining a strong Category4 hurricane as it made its first landfall over Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula early on October4, and then a second one in Cuba later that day. Matthew weakened somewhat but re-intensified as it tracked northwest, making landfall in the northern Bahamas. The storm then paralleled the coast of the southeastern United States over the next 36 hours, gradually weakening while remaining just offshore before making its fourth and final landfall over the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane on the morning of October 8. Matthew re-emerged into the Atlantic shortly afterward, eventually completing its transition into an extratropical cyclone as it turned away from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on October9.|$|E

500|$|These attacks—as well {{as similar}} {{incidents}} {{that caused the}} Southern Poverty Law Center to declare in 2002 that the animal rights movement had [...] "clearly taken a <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> more extreme"—prompted the US government to pass the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act and the UK government to add the offense of [...] "Intimidation of persons connected with animal research organisation" [...] to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. Such legislation and the arrest and imprisonment of activists may have decreased the incidence of attacks.|$|E
