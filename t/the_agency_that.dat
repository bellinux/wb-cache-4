25|$|The IAEA has {{requested}} that third parties {{allow it to}} share the documents on the alleged studies with Iran. The IAEA has further stated that though it has not provided full documents containing the alleged studies, information from other countries has corroborated some of the allegations, which appear to the IAEA to be consistent and credible, and that Iran should therefore address the alleged studies even without obtaining the full documents. However, questions about {{the authenticity of the}} documents persist, with claims that the documents were obtained either from Israel or the MEK, an Iranian dissident group officially considered to be a terrorist organization by the United States, and that investigations into the alleged studies are intended to reveal intelligence about Iran's conventional weapons programs. Some IAEA officials have requested a clear statement be made by <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>that</b> it could not affirm the documents' authenticity.

Deutch added that if the 12 CIA officers cited in Hitz's report were still employed, he would have fired two of them.

This time Aliferi proposed the continuation of construction for the two decade-old project, with several community groups either opposing the plan, or raising concerns. The proposal was to include a seven-story hotel, 83 single-family homes, two parking garages and [...] of retail space. The local highway, Laurence Parkway, would also receive improvements to better handle the new development.

In July, Murgatroyd was indicted on 19 counts of violating the state's merit system by making politically motivated hires, including that of Jamie Gray. A transportation official testified in September that Farmer had declined one job for Gray because the salary was too low and had negotiated a higher salary on the job Gray eventually got.
