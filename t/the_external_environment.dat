Dendritic cells {{are present in the}} tissues that are in contact with <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>environment,</b> mainly the skin, the inner lining of the nose, the lungs, the stomach, and the intestines. Once activated, they mature and migrate to the lymphoid tissues where they interact with T cells and B cells to initiate and orchestrate the adaptive immune response.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they were}} named, the {{proteins}} {{have been found}} to be differentially expressed in other glands that secrete products directly into <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>environment.</b> These include lacrimal, parotid, submaxillary, sublingual, preputial and mammary glands. In some species, such as cats and pigs, Mups appear not to be expressed in urine at all and are mainly found in saliva. Sometimes the term urinary Mups (uMups) is used to distinguish those Mups expressed in urine from those in other tissues.|$|E
5|$|The {{biology of}} life {{operates}} {{within a certain}} range of temperatures. Heat {{is a form of}} energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>environment.</b> In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy.|$|E

Recommendations on creation of effective social systems adaptation mechanisms for unstable conditions are developed, based on these processes.

5|$|The {{book had}} {{chapters}} on memory, imitation and suggestion, perceptual illusions, and esthetics. In these he refuted {{the idea that}} experience was just <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>environment</b> acting on and molding a mind working as a passive recipient. Stratton saw the sensation of time as being multidimensional, in analogy with perception of space. That we could simultaneously hear separately, without synthesizing, multiple mixed tones meant our experiences did not necessarily come in single file temporally. To Stratton this meant time had multiple dimensions, since simultaneous events could not be distinguished on the one past-present-future dimension of time alone. He did not address how the other dimensions could be in temporal-space if the events were indistinguishable temporally to begin with. He also analyzed poetic measure as mathematically connected to the waxing and waning span of attention, tying the arts to psychology. This last was rebutted by Charles Samuel Myers, writing in Nature, who saw poetry and its rhythm as too complex a subject to be reduced to the arithmetic of attention spans.|$|E

40|$|Condensation {{occurs in}} the inner layers of {{construction}} materials at whatever point the partial pressure of water vapor diffuses and reaches its saturation pressure. Condensation, also called sweating, damages materials, reduces thermal resistance, and by increasing the total heat transfer coefficient, results in unwanted events such as increased heat loss. This study applied minimization of thermal insulation thickness with consideration given to condensation in <b>the</b> <b>external</b> walls. <b>The</b> calculations of heat and mass transfers in the structure elements are expressed in a graphical form. While {{there was an increase}} in the required thermal insulation thickness subsequent to an increase in the internal environment’s temperature, relative humidity, and <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>environment’s</b> relative humidity, <b>the</b> required thickness decreased with an increase in <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>environment’s</b> temperature. <b>The</b> amount of water vapor transferred varied with internal or <b>external</b> conditions and <b>the</b> thickness of the insulation.

In addition, biochemical reactions are catalyzed by enzymes which sometimes prefer one isotope over others. For example, oxygenic photosynthesis is catalyzed by RuBisCO, which prefers carbon-12 over carbon-13, resulting in carbon isotope fractionation in the rock record.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how <b>the</b> <b>external</b> information <b>environment</b> in which foreign subsidiaries operate affects the investment decisions of multinational corporations (MNCs). We hypothesize {{and find that}} the investment decisions of foreign subsidiaries in country-industries with more transparent information environments are more responsive to local growth opportunities than are those of foreign subsidiaries in country-industries with less transparent information environments. Further, this effect is larger when (1) there are greater cross-border frictions between the parent and subsidiary, and (2) the parents are relatively more involved in their subsidiaries' investment decision-making process. Our results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>external</b> information <b>environment</b> helps mitigate the agency problems that arise when firms expand their operations across borders.
