50|$|Outcry {{over this}} process {{led to the}} {{foundation}} of the right <b>to</b> not <b>incriminate</b> <b>oneself</b> being established in common law and was the direct precursor of the right to silence and non-self-incrimination in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|R
50|$|Outcry {{against this}} {{practice}} (particularly in {{the trials of}} John Lilburne ("Freeborn John") around 1630 - 1649) led {{to the establishment of}} the right <b>to</b> not <b>incriminate</b> <b>oneself</b> in common-law. This was the direct precursor of similar rights in modern law, including the right to silence and non-self-incrimination in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The right itself appears as item 16 in the Levellers Agreement of the Free People of England (1649) and first appeared in US law in the Massachusetts Body of Liberties and the Connecticut Code of the same era. The Star Chamber itself, as a judicial body, was abolished by Parliament as part of the Habeas Corpus Act 1640.|$|R
5000|$|The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects {{witnesses}} {{from being}} forced <b>to</b> <b>incriminate</b> themselves. <b>Incriminating</b> <b>oneself</b> {{is defined as}} exposing oneself to [...] "an accusation or charge of crime," [...] or as involving oneself [...] "in a criminal prosecution or the danger thereof." [...] The privilege against self-incrimination is [...] "the privilege derived from the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const., and similar provisions in the constitutions of states....that requires the government to prove a criminal case against the defendant {{without the aid of}} the defendant as a witness against himself...." [...] To [...] "plead the Fifth" [...] is to refuse to answer a question because the response could form self-incriminating evidence. Historically, the legal protection against self-incrimination {{is directly related to the}} question of torture for extracting information and confessions.|$|R

50|$|During {{the trial}} on gun {{possession}} charges, Patane argued that his arrest violated the Fourth Amendment prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures and the Fifth Amendment right not <b>to</b> <b>incriminate</b> <b>oneself</b> {{because there was}} not probable cause to arrest him and because the gun had been found {{as a result of}} an un-Mirandized confession.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} section 26(7), the court making the {{restraint}} order may also make {{an order to}} compel the defendant to disclose the whereabouts, etc., of the property over which he may have effective control. This power should not be lightly exercised, as it tends to infringe on the right not <b>to</b> <b>incriminate</b> <b>oneself.</b> Note that a restraint order is appealable. The court granting the restraint order has no inherent jurisdiction to rescind that order.|$|E
2500|$|The Fifth Amendment protects {{individuals}} from being forced <b>to</b> <b>incriminate</b> themselves. <b>Incriminating</b> <b>oneself</b> {{is defined as}} exposing oneself (or another person) to [...] "an accusation or charge of crime," [...] or as involving oneself (or another person) [...] "in a criminal prosecution or the danger thereof." [...] The privilege against compelled self-incrimination is defined as [...] "the constitutional right of a person to refuse to answer questions or otherwise give testimony against himself.... To [...] "plead the Fifth" [...] is to refuse to answer any question because [...] "the implications of the question, in the setting {{in which it is}} asked" [...] lead a claimant to possess a [...] "reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer", believing that [...] "a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result." ...|$|R
50|$|Though {{the second}} premise is not {{completely}} correct, {{the main source of}} error lies in the first premise. If one truthfully reports the amount of one's income, one does not <b>incriminate</b> <b>oneself</b> in the commission of a crime. However, falsely reporting one's income is itself the commission of a crime. Put another way, the fifth amendment protects one from <b>incriminating</b> <b>oneself</b> if testifying truthfully will <b>incriminate</b> <b>oneself</b> in the commission of a crime. It does not offer a provision for lying.|$|R
5000|$|Conclusion: Since {{filing a}} 1040 <b>incriminates</b> <b>oneself,</b> filing a 1040 {{therefore}} violates one's fifth amendment rights.|$|R

[...] The court also stated that [...] "was not making a judgement on whether the right not <b>to</b> <b>incriminate</b> <b>oneself</b> is absolute or whether infringements of it may be justified in particular circumstances." ...|$|E
50|$|In Latvia, the Criminal {{procedure}} law (Kriminālprocesa likums) (sections 60.2, 150, 265 and more) {{sets out}} a right for anyone against whom criminal proceedings has been initiated or suspicions raised to remain silent. Upon arrest and before first interrogation {{of a person}} against whom any (official or unofficial) suspicion has been raised in a criminal case, such person must be warned {{of his or her}} right to remain silent, and that everything such person says may be used against that person in a criminal proceedings. Witnesses, victims and persons who`s property rights has been affected by criminal proceedings has a right not <b>to</b> <b>incriminate</b> <b>oneself</b> and his or her relatives and not to give any information that is directly or indirectly self-incriminating or may incriminate such persons` relatives. Refusal to testify or answer all or any questions on the basis of right against self-incrimination can`t be used against such person in any way or be used as evidence of guilt. No judge, prosecutor, investigator or any other public body may draw adverse inferences about a person from exercising a right against self-incrimination. Outside criminal proceedings right against self-incrimination is honored as long-standing unwritten general principle of law in all quasi-criminal (such as administrative offense law) and public proceedings, which has been repeatedly upheld by legal precedent and case law.|$|E
50|$|A federal {{investigation}} initiated before the 2014 Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, found faults with the treatment given {{youths in the}} juvenile justice system in St. Louis County, Mo. The Justice Dept, following a 20-month investigation based on 33,000 cases over three years, reported that black youths were treated more harshly than whites, and that all low-income youths, regardless of race, were deprived of their basic constitutional rights. Youths who encountered law enforcement got little or no chance to challenge detention or get any help from lawyers. With only one public defender assigned to juveniles in a county of one million, that legal aide handled 394 cases in 2014. The investigation was unrelated to the notorious case which roiled St. Louis, beginning before the police shooting of the unarmed black youth. The failure to grant access to counsel brought to light the practice of an informal process which could let offenders off with a warning or having them enter into diversion programs in lieu of being charged in court. But to be accepted into the informal process, offenders had to admit to guilt, which runs afoul of the right not <b>to</b> <b>incriminate</b> <b>oneself</b> in criminal proceedings. The investigation found enormous disparity in the way juvenile cases were handled, with blacks being 47% more likely than whites to be put through the formal criminal proceedings. It also found them more likely to be held in detention, and also subsequently sentenced to incarceration once the case was finished. They {{were also more likely to}} be detained for violating parole from a previous case.|$|E
5000|$|Premise 2: The fifth {{amendment}} says {{one does not}} have to do something that <b>incriminates</b> <b>oneself.</b>|$|R
50|$|The fifth {{amendment}} does, however, allow oneself to avoid disclosing {{the source of}} the income if doing so would <b>incriminate</b> <b>oneself</b> in the commission of a crime. One must still truthfully report the amount of the income.|$|R
50|$|One {{may not be}} made to say {{something}} that <b>incriminates</b> <b>oneself.</b> This is the natural consequence or corollary of the presumption of innocence, and it applies both to criminal and to civil cases. Sometimes, in civil cases, one might be in danger of saying something that could lead subsequently to one’s criminal prosecution. Privilege protects one in such circumstances.|$|R
40|$|A person's {{right not}} <b>to</b> <b>incriminate</b> <b>oneself</b> or {{to remain silent}} and not {{contribute}} to their own incrimination is a basic requirement of due process, although the right not to testify against oneself is not expressly guaranteed. This legal right is intended to protect the accused/ the defendant against the authorities’ abusive coercion. The scope of the right not <b>to</b> <b>incriminate</b> <b>oneself</b> is related to criminal matter under the Convention, and thus susceptible or applicable to criminal proceedings concerning all types of crimes as a guarantee to a fair trial. The European Court of Justice ruled that {{despite the fact that}} art. 6 paragraph 2 of the Convention does not expressly mention the right not <b>to</b> <b>incriminate</b> <b>oneself</b> and the right not to contribute to their own incrimination (nemo tenetur are ipsum accusare) these are generally recognized international rules that are in consistence with the notion of “fair trial” stipulated in art. 6. By virtue of the right to silence, the person charged with a crime is free to answer the questions or not, as he/she believes it is in his/her interest. Therefore, the right to silence involves not only the right not to testify against oneself, but also the right of the accused/ defendant not <b>to</b> <b>incriminate</b> <b>oneself.</b> Thus, the accused/defendant cannot be compelled to assist in the production of evidence and cannot be sanctioned for failing to provide certain documents or other evidence. Obligation to testify against personal will, under the constraint of a fine or any other form of coercion constitutes an interference with the negative aspect of the right to freedom of expression which must be necessary in a democratic society. It is essential to clarify certain issues as far as this right is concerned. First of all, the statutory provision in question is specific to adversarial systems, which are found mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries and are totally different from that underlying the current Romanian Criminal Procedure Code, which observes the tradition of continental trial systems. This type of system was traditionally adopted in our country and it underlies the entire judicial doctrine and practice endorsed by our scholars and practitioners from the foundation of the modern state to date...|$|E
40|$|The author takes a twofold approach, first {{considering}} matters {{relating to}} the identification of prisoners of war, namely contemporary {{issues such as the}} use of modern identification techniques, and then discussing interrogation procedures that go beyond the establishment of a prisoner’s identity. In this context particular attention is given to the question whether and, if so, at which point in time a prisoner of war starts to benefit from fair trial rights, namely the right to remain silent, the right not <b>to</b> <b>incriminate</b> <b>oneself</b> and the corresponding right to be informed about these fair trial protections...|$|E

50|$|If {{the witness}} is warned under section 204 of the CPA, the {{privilege}} falls away: The witness is then {{given the right}} to earn an indemnity in exchange for taking away the privilege against self-incrimination. For example, if while housebreaking one sees a murder occurring, one may be indemnified against <b>incriminating</b> <b>oneself</b> in providing evidence of the murder. This {{is a question of}} State strategy: The murder is obviously the more serious offence. Once the procedure in section 204 has been correctly followed, the witness loses the privilege, but gains indemnity against any future prosecution on that charge. This can be controversial: Glenn Agliotti was famously called as a witness against Jackie Selebi in terms of section 204, and admitted to having paid a bribe. It could be argued that in such circumstances the bigger crook is allowed to get away with it.|$|R
