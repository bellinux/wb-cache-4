5|$|By 9 April, <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> {{decreasing}} on the New Zealand {{positions as}} the Germans shifted their offensive {{north to the}} area around Armentières. While {{the bulk of the}} New Zealand Division remained on the Somme and consolidated its defences, some of its artillery went to reinforce the British forces bearing the brunt of the renewed German attacks. Casualties for this period of the war were high; nearly 1,000 of the division's personnel were killed through March and April and almost 2,700 were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Radar {{was also}} {{employed}} {{to determine the}} size of the hurricane's eye, stated to be roughly 13mi (20km) in diameter, following a 6-mile (10km) decrease due to the strengthening. Light wind shear surrounding the hurricane allowed further strengthening to take place. Late on August2, the system attained winds of 135mph (215km/h), making it a Category4 storm. During the afternoon of August3, Guillermo nearly attained Category5 intensity as it reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 155mph (250km/h) along with a barometric pressure estimated at 925mbar (hPa; 27.32inHg). A brief period of weakening took place later that day before further strengthening ensued. Late on August4, Guillermo intensified into a Category5 hurricane, attaining peak winds of 160mph (260km/h). Operational analysis of satellite information indicated a minimum pressure of 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg); however, post-storm studies stated that <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> more likely around 919mbar (hPa; 27.14inHg).|$|E

60|$|Hence the {{absolute}} quantity of oxygen {{in a given}} volume of atmospheric air, when <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> 23 in., and the temp. 60 degrees, is 20.14 per cent. less than when <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> 30 in. and the temp. 80 degrees.|$|R
5|$|Synthetic gem-quality diamond {{crystals}} {{were first}} produced in 1970 by GE, then reported in 1971. The first successes used a pyrophyllite tube seeded {{at each end}} with thin pieces of diamond. The graphite feed material {{was placed in the}} center and the metal solvent (nickel) between the graphite and the seeds. The container was heated and <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> raised to about 5.5GPa. The crystals grow as they flow from the center {{to the ends of the}} tube, and extending the length of the process produces larger crystals. Initially, a week-long growth process produced gem-quality stones of around 5mm (1 carat or 0.2 g), and the process conditions had to be as stable as possible. The graphite feed was soon replaced by diamond grit because that allowed much better control of the shape of the final crystal.|$|E
5|$|Australia was {{regarded}} by swimming analysts as a medal chance, {{but were not}} seen as the main threatsSweden, Great Britain and the Soviet Union were the most heavily fancied teams.

Their freestyler Sergey Koplyakov later came fourth in the corresponding 100m event. The British boasted Duncan Goodhew, the 100m breaststroke gold medallist, and Gary Abraham, who had placed fifth in the 100m backstroke. Sweden's butterflyer Pär Arvidsson and backstroker Bengt Baron had won their respective 100m events and their freestyle swimmer Per Holmertz would win silver in the 100m a few days later. Their weakest swimmer was the breaststroker Peter Berggren, who came ninth in the 100m. On paper, Australia's team paled in comparison. Brooks later came seventh in his 100m freestyle semifinal and 14th overall after having an asthma attack, and Evans was Australia's only medallist in the corresponding individual event, winning bronze in the breaststroke. Kerry had been eliminated in the 100m backstroke semifinals, while Tonelli was the Australian champion in the 100m freestyle and backstroke but was swimming as a makeshift butterflyer; the nation {{did not have an}} entrant in the 100m butterfly. Adding to <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> Australia's failure to win any gold medals in any sport at the 1976 Olympics.

Coming into the Olympics, Australia were ranked seventh out of the thirteen competing countries. Australia's prospects improved after the morning heats in which Sweden was disqualified. Tonelli, the eldest swimmer in the quartet at the age of 23, convened the team as its de facto leader. He asked his team-mates to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to swim the backstroke in 57s, Evans the breaststroke in 63s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49.8s, even though he had never gone faster than 51s. Tonelli named the foursome as the Quietly Confident Quartet, and they exhibited a quiet confidence as they lined up for the race.|$|E
