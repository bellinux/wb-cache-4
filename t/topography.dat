30|$|A {{solution}} is also required {{to increase the}} durability of antifouling <b>topographies</b> in marine environments {{to be considered a}} viable option for commercial antifouling applications. Moreover, there has yet to be any solution to prevent the formation of biofilms that would eventually hide and overcome the antifouling properties of <b>topographies.</b> This suggests that environmental factors (e.g. hydrodynamic shear, biofilms, conspecific cues) are influential towards antifouling <b>topographies</b> and current <b>topographies</b> are still not well equipped to be in marine environments for long periods of time. Hence, combinations of several strategies are likely the best option to maintain the durability and performance of antifouling <b>topographies.</b> More field trials are necessary to corroborate observations from laboratory tests and calculations from quantitative models for optimum designs of foul-resistant <b>topographies.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{functional}} analysis identified the reinforcers for 3 participants' problem behavior, but only relatively mild problem behaviors (e. g., screaming, disruption) were observed when all <b>topographies</b> produced tested consequences. We then conducted an extinction analysis in which specific <b>topographies</b> produced a reinforcer while all other <b>topographies</b> were on extinction. The extinction analysis {{confirmed that the}} same reinforcer identified in the initial {{functional analysis}} maintained more severe <b>topographies</b> of problem behavior (e. g., aggression). In addition, results of the extinction analysis indicated that 2 of the participants displayed patterns of responding consistent with a response class hierarchy hypothesis, in which less severe problem behavior frequently occurred prior to more severe <b>topographies.</b> The 3 rd participant displayed a response pattern indicative of differential reinforcement effects...|$|R

30|$|Unlike macro and micro <b>topographies,</b> {{nanostructures}} {{that were}} tested for marine antifouling purposes {{have been limited}} to irregular self-assembled geometries of mixed nano sizes. There are studies that have studied the effects of regular arrays of nano <b>topographies</b> at deterring biofouling but these have been limited to other applications [92, 93]. Hence, future investigations should develop regular, nano-sized <b>topographies</b> to be analysed for marine antifouling purposes.|$|R

5|$|In 1953, Robert S. Dietz and {{his colleagues}} first {{identified}} the swell behavior. It was suggested that the cause was mantle upwelling. Later work pointed to tectonic uplift, caused by reheating within the lower lithosphere. However, normal seismic activity beneath the swell, as well as lack of detected heat flow, caused scientists to suggest dynamic <b>topography</b> as the cause, in which {{the motion of the}} hot and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface <b>topography</b> around the islands. Understanding the Hawaiian swell has important implications for hotspot study, island formation, and inner Earth.|$|E
5|$|Almost all of Manila sits on top {{of centuries}} of prehistoric {{alluvial}} deposits built by {{the waters of the}} Pasig River and on some land reclaimed from Manila Bay. Manila's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since the American colonial times.

30|$|Hierarchical <b>topographies</b> are {{relatively}} new and {{have yet to}} be extensively explored for marine antifouling applications. Nonetheless, there were promising results which indicated that these <b>topographies</b> might have the potential to reduce fouling by both micro and macro organisms. Therefore, future studies on antifouling <b>topographies</b> should consider mixed scales of hierarchical structures that might have the potential to prevent a wider array of taxa from settling.|$|R
25|$|Unordered <b>topographies</b> are {{generally}} created by processes that occur spontaneously during other processing; the patterns are random in orientation and organization with imprecise or {{no control over}} feature geometry. The advantage to creating unordered <b>topographies</b> over ordered is that the processes are often less time consuming, less expensive, and do not require great skill and experience. Unordered <b>topographies</b> can be created by polymer demixing, colloidal lithography and chemical etching.|$|R
25|$|Ordered <b>topographies</b> {{are defined}} as {{patterns}} that are organized and geometrically precise. Though there are many methods for creating ordered <b>topographies,</b> they are usually time-consuming, requiring skill and experience {{and the use of}} expensive equipment.|$|R

Bones of birds and fish were also found. Faunal finds indicate that the area was forested over an undulating <b>topography.</b>|$|E

30|$|Most macro {{invertebrates}} {{reviewed in}} Additional file 3 : Table S 3 settled effectively on macro-sized <b>topographies</b> {{that consisted of}} bumps, holes and V-shaped grooves [22, 36, 55 – 57]. These <b>topographies</b> were generally larger in scale relative {{to the size of}} invertebrates and were likely considered to be suitable by these organisms for settlement and adhesion. Turbulent flows over macro sized <b>topographies</b> creates disturbances in the viscous sublayer of the boundary layer that is directly adjacent to the surface [44]. Disturbance in the viscous sublayer increases hydrodynamic drag or friction {{on the surface of the}} substrate which is a condition that must be avoided particularly in the shipping industry. Hence, it could be argued that <b>topographies</b> at this scale are not suitable for marine antifouling applications. However, the differences in macro-invertebrate settlement patterns observed on macro-scale <b>topographies</b> highlight essential factors that are of interest to antifouling research.|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between {{verbal and nonverbal}} behavior with common syntactic properties was investigated, using retarded and nonretarded children. Reinforcement was contingent on either verbal or nonverbal responses whereas responses of the other repertoire had no experimental consequences. Changes sometimes occurred in the unreinforced (collateral) repertoire, but they were always changes in the stimulus control of pre-existing <b>topographies.</b> A contingency involving responses of one repertoire never instated new <b>topographies</b> in the collateral repertoire. This suggested {{that the problem of}} “cross-modality generalization” should be reformulated to distinguish explicitly between instating new <b>topographies</b> and changing the stimulus control of pre-existing <b>topographies.</b> The result confirmed Skinner's hypothesis about “the same response spoken and heard” and clarified some anomalies in previous studies...|$|R
25|$|Physical cues {{are formed}} by {{creating}} an ordered surface structure {{at the level of}} the microstructure and/or nanostructure. Physical cues on the nanoscale have been shown to modulate cell adhesion, migration, orientation, contact inhibition, gene expression, and cytoskeletal formation. This allows for the direction of cell processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and spreading. There are numerous methods for the manufacture of micro- and nanoscale <b>topographies,</b> which can be divided into those that create ordered <b>topographies</b> and those that create unordered <b>topographies.</b>|$|R
5|$|Downcutting and canyon {{widening}} continue {{today as}} the process of erosion continues to try to reduce the <b>topography</b> to sea level. In 1998 a flash flood temporarily increased the Virgin River's flow rate from 200 to 4,500ft³/s (6 to 125m³/s). Geologists estimate that the Virgin River can cut another thousand feet (300m) before it loses the ability to transport sediment to the Colorado River to the south. However, additional uplift will probably increase this figure.|$|E

40|$|In this investigation, {{extinction}} (EXT) {{was applied}} {{alone or in}} combination with func-tional communication training (FCT) to less severe <b>topographies</b> of problem behavior while more severe <b>topographies</b> continued to be reinforced. EXT alone decreased less severe and increased more severe <b>topographies</b> of problem behavior (i. e., response co-variation), whereas EXT with FCT reduced all <b>topographies</b> of problem behavior to near-zero levels. DESCRIPTORS: response covariation, extinction, functional communication train-ing, severe disabilities Individuals with severe disabilities who engage in problem behavior frequently dis-play multiple response <b>topographies</b> that vary in severity and frequency but are mem-bers of the same functional response class (Sprague & Horner, 1992). It is not uncom-mon for behavior-reduction programs to tar-get one problem behavior at a time. How-ever, punishment of one problem behavior (e. g., disruption) may decrease that response and increase another behavior (e. g., aggres-sion) if the responses are maintained by the same reinforcer (Grace, Kahng, & Fisher, 1994; Sprague & Horner, 1992). When ex-tinction is applied to some but not all to-pographies of problem behavior, more severe forms of problem behavior may emerge, ei-ther {{as part of an}} extinction burst or simply as new alternative <b>topographies.</b> An inter-vention that includes reinforcement for a functionally equivalent alternative response (e. g., communication), concurrent with im-plementation of extinction, may help to pre...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, two novel {{spatial filter}} {{approaches}} for artifact correction in continuous {{recordings of the}} electro- (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) are presented. The spatial filters differ from earlier approaches such as multiple source eye correction (MSEC) or independent component analysis (ICA) in the way artifact and brain signal <b>topographies</b> are estimated. Comparable to MSEC, artifact <b>topographies</b> are derived from single or averaged artifact prototypes. In order to model brain signal <b>topographies,</b> two novel concepts are introduced: the preselection approach and spatially constrained ICA (SCICA). In the preselection approach, a relevant number of eigenvectors is extracted from an artifact-free subset of the data segment. The subset is obtained by excluding sample vectors from the original data segment that exceed a certain amplitude or correlation with the predefined artifact subspace. In SCICA, brain signal <b>topographies</b> are estimated from the whole data segment. SCICA uses the prior knowledge about artifact <b>topographies</b> and combines this spatial information with the temporal-statistical strategy of ICA to estimate brain signal <b>topographies.</b> Starting from n artifact <b>topographies,</b> the artifact-contaminated data segment of m channels is decomposed iteratively into m-n further components until all waveforms are maximally independent under the spatial constraint. An algorithm to perform the SCICA decomposition is introduced. Spatial filtering of EEG/MEG segments applying preselection and SCICA shows that both approaches can remove artifacts completely without distortion of relevant brain signals. However, the preselection approach depends crucially on the subjective choice of parameters such as the correlation threshold. Advantages of SCICA over ICA are demonstrated...|$|R
