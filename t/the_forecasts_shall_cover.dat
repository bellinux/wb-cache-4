30|$|The {{evaluation}} {{framework is}} motivated by this one of [20] where the performance also evaluated once for all out-of-sample days and once without the holidays. As basic evaluation method, we consider the mean absolute error (MAE) which is optimal if <b>the</b> point <b>forecast</b> corresponds to <b>the</b> median. We also evaluate the performance concerning the {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) which is optimal if <b>the</b> point <b>forecast</b> <b>shall</b> match <b>the</b> mean. As the models are designed on <b>forecasting</b> <b>the</b> mean, the evaluation focus should be on the RMSE. Note that we are not considering the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) even though it is still popular in energy forecasting, especially in engineering literature. The reason is that the MAPE is not a suitable forecasting evaluation measure, especially with respect to significance evaluation [53].|$|R

Under this perspective, load forecasting performs an important task, allowing the optimization of investments and the adequate exploitation of existing distribution networks. This paper describes the models developed for current intensity forecasting at primary substation feeders. The main goal consists on defining a regression process characterized by good quality estimates of those future intensity values, based on historical database. Anticipation interval shall include from the next hour to one week in advance. <b>The</b> <b>forecasting</b> method <b>shall</b> also be adaptable to power network reconfiguration, whenever planned or not. In this work, artificial neural networks (ANN) were used as the basic regression tool. This paper describes used ANN as well as the premises that led to the implementation of selected forecasting models...|$|R
40|$|The Port of Thessaloniki is {{the second}} biggest port in Greece after Piraeus. Located in the Northern part of the country, it has a large {{hinterland}} above it, the Balkan Peninsula, which renders the Port a transit one. It is naturally protected from winds and waves {{and it is the}} best alternative for vessels coming from the Suez Canal and heading towards the Balkans. Competition though is intense in the Adriatic and the Black Sea especially due to the container industry booming as well as the concession of several container terminals in the region to international stevedoring companies. The Port of Thessaloniki seems to be at the moment the leading spoke port in the region. In order thus to maintain this leading position, a proper Masterplan is required, something that has been missing for the last years. This Thesis is the result of an effort to create such a port planning. An inventory of the present situation of the Port was conducted taking into account elements like dry and wet infrastructure, road and rail networks, connections with the regional and national transport networks as well as waterside and landside handling equipment using methods like the queuing theory. These figures were compared to the present cargo and passenger throughput in order to depict deficiencies, lacks and surpluses per terminal. The future needs were then demonstrated based on forecasts. These <b>forecasts</b> were <b>the</b> combination of the extrapolation of past data, the consideration of several transport trends (containerization, liquefied natural gas) as well as the insight in the financial situation of the Balkan countries that constitute the potential customers of the Port. Three different growth scenarios were assumed while the 28 -years duration of the Masterplan was divided into three periods (2008 - 2015 - 2025 - 2035). Having these needs as a base, eight alternatives were generated. A multi criteria analysis was then used in order to end up with the three most promising alternatives; the validity of this analysis was verified by five sensitivity checks which demonstrated similar results. Finally an ideal port layout was chosen which was accompanied by the respective construction phasing. The present Thesis was meant to fill a gap; that of the lack of a Masterplan. Fortunately, it can be concluded that the present condition of the Port is adequate for the current cargo and passenger throughput which shows that the rough planning that has been implemented by the consequent authorities until now was successful. Moreover, from now and on, a Masterplan should be considered as mandatory and the present Thesis comprises the ideal blueprint for this. In order to render this report more realistic though, regular updates shall be conducted almost every five years while <b>the</b> <b>forecasts</b> <b>shall</b> be checked and readjusted continuously.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. There are {{two basic}} {{approaches}} to forecasting: model building and time data analysis. Model building, the more complex of the two, takes basic economic relationships and develops a simple model for the data. The simple income and consumption equations, Y=C+I and C=α+βY, are {{a good example of}} a model. The regression analysis as a method of <b>forecasting</b> <b>shall</b> be examined under the model building approach. The second method, data-based analysis, derives its <b>forecasts</b> on <b>the</b> past values of <b>the</b> <b>forecasted</b> variable. Under this approach, we shall look at exponential smoothing and the ARIMA techniques. These three techniques, regression, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA modeling, shall be explained and then applied to an empirical example. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R
40|$|ITAB Shop Concept Nässjö AB {{is a major}} {{actor in}} the shop {{interior}} decoration market. ITAB has during several years, seen their inventory levels increase and has experienced efficiency problems in their purchasing. Part of ITAB's problems is their customers’ very unsteady demand and their inability to give ITAB good information on when and where they will open or refurbish their stores. In ITAB’s efforts to improve their purchasing they have decided to move from a system where they exchange single orders with their suppliers, with a given, fixed delivery time, {{to a system of}} sending block orders and exchange <b>forecasts.</b> <b>The</b> block order system means that ITAB places an order for the full amount of an article needed during a set period. The suppliers will then deliver the amount needed by ITAB at several occasions specified by ITAB. Delivery schedules and <b>forecast</b> will give <b>the</b> supplier the information as to how much and when to deliver. However, this change has yet to be implemented. The {{purpose of this study is}} thus to analyse what effects such a change might have on ITAB and their suppliers. The study made is based on a qualitative approach. The information used to analyse the problem was acquired through several semi-structured interviews with different managers within ITAB as well as two people within each of the supplier organisations. Five of ITAB’s suppliers were interviewed. The people interviewed in the supplier organisations all belonged to sales, or order department or production planning or vice president. Mapping was used to illustrate the current order flow, purchasing flow, and production flow within ITAB as well as the order flow in the supplier organisations. The outcome of the interviews was that several of the suppliers showed a very positive attitude to the implementation of the block order system. The cooperation between them and ITAB seemed, according to both parties, to be working well. A good relationship is a good basis to introduce new routines and deepen the relationship. The suppliers believed that a forecast would give them the possibility to improve their production planning as well as their capacity use. However, each supplier set terms for its implementation. One being that the information sharing between the two companies must improve. ITAB also have to take the responsibility as well as ownership of everything they purchase. If this is the case, most suppliers aired a certain promise to be able to store ITAB’s products before delivering and to be able to implement the block order system. However, there need to be further negotiations between ITAB and the suppliers to discuss and settle the exact terms of contract. It is the authors’ belief that some prerequisites must be fulfilled before ITAB implements the block order system. The information sharing between the two companies must improve. If <b>the</b> <b>forecast</b> <b>shall</b> give <b>the</b> suppliers some benefits, they need to be as accurate as possible. The communication about orders has to be timelier and fit the suppliers lead times better. Today, the suppliers often receive order information from ITAB too late, which causes difficulties. If the suppliers are to trust <b>the</b> <b>forecasts,</b> they must be as accurate as possible. It is the author’s belief that if this is not so the suppliers will increase their inventory costs as well as continue to have difficulties delivering. It is also the author’s belief that the communication between sales and purchasing in ITAB needs to improve so that <b>the</b> <b>forecast</b> can be updated in a timely fashion as well as correctly. More involvement of suppliers as well as purchasing and production within ITAB’s product development phase could help them prepare for changes, and prevent mishaps...|$|R
