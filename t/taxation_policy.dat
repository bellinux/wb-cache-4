25|$|Partnerships {{recognized}} {{by a government}} body may enjoy special benefits from <b>taxation</b> <b>policy.</b> Among developed countries, for example, business partnerships are often favored over corporations in <b>taxation</b> <b>policy,</b> since dividend taxes only occur on profit before they are distributed to the partners. However, depending on the partnership structure and the jurisdiction in which it operates, owners of a partnership may be exposed to greater personal liability than they would as shareholders of a corporation. In such countries, partnerships are often regulated via anti-trust laws, so as to inhibit monopolistic practices and foster free market competition. Enforcement of the laws, however, varies considerably. Domestic partnerships {{recognized by}} governments typically enjoy tax benefits, as well.|$|E

25|$|Al-Jazzar {{understood}} {{well that}} in order to maintain his political and military dominance in Syria, his rule needed a solid economic foundation. Al-Jazzar acquired his income from a variety of means, namely taxes, commerce, tolls and extortion. As such, he continued and strengthened the lucrative monopolies on cotton and grain that were established by Zahir. In the 1780s, he expelled French cotton traders from Acre and Jaffa. Improvements in agricultural development and increased trade from Palestine bolstered the economic prosperity of certain enclaves of territory in his domain, particularly the coastal cities of Acre, Sidon and Beirut. He successfully suppressed marauding Bedouin tribes and thus increased security and maintained order in his territories. Although he attempted to attract immigrants, including Christians and Jews, to settle in his domains, al-Jazzar's institution and strict enforcement of a stringent and high <b>taxation</b> <b>policy</b> heavily burdened the population to the point that many emigrated from the areas he ruled to neighboring regions.|$|E
25|$|He {{attended}} Gilman School in Baltimore, {{and then}} went to Harvard University, graduating in 1968 with a degree in Dutch art history. During his time at Gilman, Symington met Thomas Caplan, who would later introduce him to Bill Clinton during college. At 19 years old, Symington rescued Clinton from nearly drowning during a trip to Hyannis Port, Massachusetts near the Kennedy compound. While studying at Harvard, Symington discovered the works of Nobel Prize winner Friedrich Hayek, an economist, social theorist and political philosopher who promoted limited government and free markets. Hayek's work would serve as an influence for Symington's political beliefs in regards to fiscal and <b>taxation</b> <b>policy</b> as Governor. Symington was also a supporter of Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election against Lyndon B. Johnson. Beginning in 1967, he served in the United States Air Force during the Vietnam War, and was stationed at Luke Air Force Base near Glendale, Arizona. In 1971, he was awarded the Bronze Star for meritorious service, before being honorably discharged. He remained in Arizona and became involved in real estate development, founding his own company, The Symington Company, in 1976. In 1983, he was appointed to Southwest Savings and Loan Association board of directors which was based in Salt Lake City, Utah.|$|E

Ture Turesson accompanied the King to Finland in July. On their return in August, the Archbishop was imprisoned and brought to Denmark by the King, with Ture Turesson reinstated as Castellan of Stockholm.

However, the report concluded that: [...] "Unfortunately, Huntsman has completely dropped the ball on spending, with per capita spending increasing at about 10 percent annually during his tenure."

500|$|Analysis of the MIS {{failures}} of Great Southern Group and Timbercorp focused on several factors. First, critics argued that some MIS investments resembled Ponzi schemes, where securing financial returns for existing investors relied on attracting new investors {{rather than on}} successful economic activity. Second, Great Southern Group's rapid expansion had been underpinned by high levels of debt, and in difficult economic circumstances in which new investment was diminishing and new borrowings were hard to obtain, that debt could not successfully be serviced. Third, some experts and Great Southern Group itself expressed concern that investor uncertainty caused by ATO rulings, and fueled by reporting of <b>taxation</b> <b>policy</b> issues, had scared investors away from their MIS. This was a view that the Australian Taxation Office rejected, arguing that the administrators of both Timbercorp and Great Southern had not identified taxation uncertainty as an issue. Finally, a range of commentators considered that the MIS tax concessions were encouraging unsustainable business models, with companies focusing on selling the tax benefits of investments rather than focussing on profitable commodity production. This, it was argued, led them to underestimate business risks, overinflate land prices, and sell products at lower-than-optimal prices. The failure of MIS schemes for these reasons was predicted in 2008 by Ajani, who argued that [...] "we know that investment driven by the demand for tax minimisation, and not market realities, is associated with collapse".|$|E
500|$|Bruce {{moved quickly}} to secure a working {{majority}} for his government. He convinced Hughes' long time political ally George Pearce to join his ministry and shored up {{the support of the}} other former National Labor members of the Nationalist Party whom had walked out of the Labor Party with Hughes in 1916. He appointed William Watt as Speaker of the House, effectively removing one of his key opponents from the benches, a tactical manoeuvre that became common in Australian politics thereafter. But his most lasting political achievement was the negotiation of {{what became known as the}} Coalition an arrangement of electoral and political cooperation between the Nationalists (and their successors) and the Country Party. Although differing greatly in character and background, the orderly and diplomatic Bruce forged a strong working relationship with the intelligent but irascible Country Party leader Page. Bruce had to pay a very high price for this relationship, however. [...] As part of the Coalition agreement, the Country Party received five seats in a Cabinet of 11. [...] Page also became Treasurer and ranked second in the Cabinet. The Nationalists also made major concessions on rural development and <b>taxation</b> <b>policy</b> compromises that stirred some resentment among some members of Bruce's party. [...] Page, who would serve as Treasurer and de facto Deputy Prime Minister throughout Bruce's tenure, would become a great admirer of Bruce, stating, [...] "He was a leader who impressed his colleagues with his sincerity and his capacity, and earned their loyalty as the reward for his wisdom and integrity." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{question}} of government issues(253) of paper money again came [...] {{up in the}} United States in 1862, during the civil war, and part of [...] our present currency {{is the result of}} the policy then adopted. The [...] first step—the one that generally costs—however, was taken July [...] 17, 1861, when the Treasury issued $50,000,000 of “demand notes,” [...] not bearing interest. These notes, however, were not made legal [...] tender. They could be used in payment of salaries and other dues [...] from the United States. It may be well to state that the Treasury [...] balanced the arguments for and against the issues of paper at the [...] beginning of the experiment, and we can see how these views were [...] realized as we go along. In favor of paper issues it was urged [...] that we could borrow a large amount without interest, as in the [...] case of the Continental currency; that there would be no expense [...] beyond the coin necessary for keeping the paper at par; and that [...] the country would gain a uniform currency. On the other hand, it [...] was seen that there might be temptations to issue without [...] provisions for redemption; that even if a fund were kept, a [...] disturbance of the money market would precipitate a demand for [...] coin, and all upon this single fund; and, lastly, that there were [...] all the dangers of over-issue. Secretary Chase(254) then decided [...] against paper issues. Government bonds, however, did not sell, and [...] the attempt of the banks toward the end of 1861 to carry [...] $150,000,000 of bonds brought on a suspension of specie payments, [...] December 31, 1861. Without any <b>taxation</b> <b>policy,</b> the country [...] drifted along, until in a spasm of dread at seeing an empty [...] Treasury, Congress passed the legal-tender act (February 25, [...] 1862), issuing $150,000,000 of paper in the form of promises to [...] pay. A committee of bankers showed that the issue could have been [...] avoided by selling bonds at their market price; but Congress would [...] not sell them below par. No necessity for the issues of paper need [...] have arrived. In four months another issue of $150,000,000 was [...] authorized (July 11, 1862); and a third issue of a like amount [...] (March 3, 1863), in all $450,000,000. The depreciation took place [...] (see Chart No. XII), for, as Secretary Chase anticipated, no [...] provision was made for redemption. They were made legal tender, [...] but this “essential idea” did not preserve their value; nor did [...] the provision that they be received for taxes (except customs), [...] avail for this purpose.|$|E
40|$|Three {{policy options}} for {{greenhouse}} gas abatement in the predominantly grazing systems of Western Australia are analysed. The two <b>taxation</b> <b>policies</b> ({{a tax on}} total emissions, and a tax on methane emissions only) are only effective at extreme tax rates ($ 85 /t CO 2 equivalents) where farming systems are no longer economically viable. The third policy option, emission restrictions, allows farms to remain profitable at approximately four times greater abatement levels than the <b>taxation</b> <b>policies,</b> and {{is found to be}} the most effective and efficient policy option studied. However, it is concluded that the introduction of any farm-level policy for greenhouse gas abatement would be politically unpopular and, in the absence of swift and innovative technological change, would cause the current farming systems to fail and be replaced by alternative land-uses. ...|$|R
