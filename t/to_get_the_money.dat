25|$|A lower {{threshold}} of mens rea is satisfied when a defendant recognizes an act is dangerous but decides to commit it anyway. This is recklessness. It is the mental {{state of mind}} of the person {{at the time the}} actus reus was committed. For instance, if C tears a gas meter from a wall <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> inside, and knows this will let flammable gas escape into a neighbour's house, he could be liable for poisoning. Courts often consider whether the actor did recognize the danger, or alternatively ought to have recognized a risk. Of course, a requirement only that one ought to have recognized a danger (though he did not) is tantamount to erasing intent as a requirement. In this way, the importance of mens rea has been reduced in some areas of the criminal law but is obviously still an important part in the criminal system.|$|E
