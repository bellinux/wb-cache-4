After that, they sent California Chrome to Harris Farms {{where he was}} turned out on pasture. By early July, his foot was fully healed, he had gained weight, and Sherman was pleased enough with his recovery that he brought the colt back to Los Alamitos to resume training on July 17, two weeks earlier than anticipated.|$|E

5|$|The {{families}} of Mecoptera are well accepted by taxonomists but their relationships have been debated. In 1987, R. Willman <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> Mecoptera as a clade, containing the Boreidae as sister to the Meropeidae, but in 2002 M. F. Whiting declared the Mecoptera paraphyletic, with the Boreidae as sister to another order, the Siphonaptera (fleas).|$|E
5|$|The {{important}} {{mathematical constant}} , sometimes called Euler's number, is approximately equal to 2.718 {{and is the}} base of the natural logarithm. Although exponentiation of e could, in principle, be <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> same as exponentiation of any other real number, such exponentials turn out to have particularly elegant and useful properties. Among other things, these properties allow exponentials of e to be generalized in a natural way to other types of exponents, such as complex numbers or even matrices, while coinciding with the familiar meaning of exponentiation with rational exponents.|$|E

5|$|The {{next section}} accuses the Dissenters of {{involvement}} with various notorious and hideous {{events of the}} past century, including the English Civil War and Monmouth's Rebellion. The accusations become increasingly sinister, and at points the speaker directly addresses the Dissenters ("You have butchered one King! deposed another King! and made a Mock King of a third!"). A brief history is given of how past monarchs—from James I to William III—have <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> Dissenters; in the opinion of the speaker, it is too leniently.|$|E
5|$|Under John, {{the monks}} of Bath became {{known for their}} scholarship, {{although}} he was not particularly noted for learning. William of Malmsebury claimed he was generous and affable, although the chronicler acknowledged that the bishop <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> canons of Wells abominably. William also recorded that John was a heavy drinker and not given to self-restraint, but that his health was good and he lived to be old. At first he <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> monks at Bath with contempt and confiscated much of the lands of the abbey for his own use, but in 1106 he restored their lands to them. John's canons of Wells disliked him because he reduced their income and destroyed some of their buildings {{as part of the}} movement of the see to Bath. A layman official of the diocese, Hildebert, was probably John's brother; and he held the offices of steward of the diocese and was also the provost of Wells, an inheritable office. John gave much of the revenues of Wells to Hildebert. Another relative, a nephew also named John, was named archdeacon in the diocese.|$|E
5|$|While Athens was {{preoccupied with}} the Social War (357–355 BC), PhilipII retook Amphipolis from them in 357BC and the {{following}} year recaptured Pydna and Potidaea, the latter of which he {{handed over to the}} Chalcidian League as promised in a treaty. In 356BC, he took Crenides, refounding it as Philippi, while his general Parmenion defeated the Illyrian king Grabos of the Grabaei. During the 355–354BC siege of Methone, PhilipII lost his right eye to an arrow wound, but managed to capture the city and <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants cordially, unlike the Potidaeans, who had been enslaved.|$|E

5|$|Antigonus entered Sparta triumphantly, {{its first}} foreign conqueror. Nevertheless, he <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> {{population}} generously and humanely. He ordered that the reforms of Cleomenes be revoked, and restored the ephors, {{although he did}} not force Sparta to join the League. However, Antigonus' failure to restore the Spartan Kings suggests to historian Graham Shipley that this restoration of laws was a sham. Within three days, he left Sparta and returned to Macedon to deal with a Dardani invasion, leaving a garrison in Acrocorinth and Orchomenos. With Cleomenes' defeat, Sparta's power collapsed and it fell into the hands of successive tyrants.|$|E
5|$|As the Second World War loomed, the British Admiralty {{commissioned}} Lethbridge {{to undertake}} a reconnaissance mission to Iceland to analyse German naval activity around the country, which he carried out in summer 1939. Lethbridge however <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> mission with contempt, spending {{much of the time}} visiting sites that interested him, such as locations mentioned in the Icelandic Sagas. Back in Britain, he self-published a short volume discussing his Icelandic journey, News from Tili. As war broke out, Lethbridge organised the transfer of much of the museum's collections to Balsham Caves for safe keeping, while also becoming a warden of the Air Raid Precautions. He also led the rescue excavation of ten prehistoric tumuli that were being destroyed to enable the construction of Snailwell Airfield for the Royal Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Capitalising on anti-French sentiment, {{the paper}} {{went on to}} discuss Bảo Đại's {{upbringing}} in France, claiming that he was already womanising as a teenager because of his European upbringing. Bảo Đại later married an ethnic Vietnamese French citizen, who became Empress Nam Phương, who had been raised Catholic. The editorials accused her of being a French agent and claimed she had <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> queen mother badly, a serious character flaw as Confucianism strongly emphasized respect for elders. Hong Van went on to claim that Bảo Đại's sequence of Gallic lovers was an indication that colonial officials were successfully using sex to turn {{the head of state}} into a puppet of France.|$|E

5|$|Coach Leeman Bennett <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> {{season as}} a {{building}} season, but was disappointed with the team's mental errors and lack of progress. Later in the season, he would begin to privately admit that the Buccaneers' talent was much worse than he had realized. Steve DeBerg won the starting quarterback job after outplaying Steve Young in the preseason, but was benched in favor of Young after struggling {{in the first two}} games. Kevin House and Jimmie Giles were released after an October loss to the New Orleans Saints, along with ex-Dallas Cowboys fullback Ron Springs. Bennett showed up at a press conference held after the season by owner Hugh Culverhouse, unaware {{that the purpose of the}} press conference was to announce Bennett's firing. Giles, then with the Detroit Lions, criticized the move, saying that no coach could compensate for the Buccaneers' lack of talent. He also claimed that administrator Phil Krueger destroyed team chemistry by demeaning players during contract negotiations, pointing to guard Sean Farrell's disgruntlement as an example.|$|E
5|$|Deep Purple's {{members were}} {{experienced}} musicians with different musical backgrounds: Lord had trained in classical music and {{had played in}} jazz and blues rock ensembles, Blackmore and Simper came from session work in pop rock, Paice and Evans from beat bands. However, no one was an accomplished songwriter. The only one with experience in musical composition was Lord, who <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> arrangements and wrote {{the bulk of the}} music for the first album, with some guitar riffs added by Blackmore. The album shows the potential of the band but does not focus on a distinct sound. Clearly identifiable on the album are the musical styles which were developing in the UK in that period and that influenced the young musicians in Deep Purple, a mix of psychedelic rock, progressive rock, pop rock and hard rock, the latter mostly evident in Blackmore's guitar parts.|$|E
5|$|Detectives also {{investigated}} {{the death of}} a woman who had been a colleague of Smith at the Rainbow. Patricia Lynott, a divorced mother of two from Ireland who had moved to Birmingham, had been found dead in her flat in October 2000. Police had not <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> death as suspicious, but after they discovered her connection to Smith, her body was exhumed for a second post mortem. This proved to be inconclusive, and in January 2003 a coroner's jury in Birmingham recorded an open verdict after hearing that the cause of her death could not be determined.|$|E

5|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the navy, army, and local government devised a cleanup plan. Three hundred government employees (with guidance of the military) worked to clear debris. They quickly restored water and power service, and within a few days streets had been cleaned for most of the impacted area. Authorities in Manzanillo asked for medicine, clothing and food from nearby areas while the red cross <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> injured. Many of the displaced were evacuated to government offices. Within {{a few days after the}} storm, the ports of Manzanillo, Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Lazaro Cardenas were reopened. The remnants of the storm later brought rain to the Rockie Mountains and the Southwestern United States.

5|$|Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General is {{the name}} of two cases of the Singapore courts, a High Court {{decision}} delivered in 2008 and the 2009 judgment by the Court of Appeal.

It was alleged that the authorities had acted in violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, which guarantees the rights to equality before the law and equal protection of the law.|$|E
5|$|Fielding first {{produced}} a play in February 1728. Although his first production, Love in Several Masques, {{lasted only a}} few nights, it {{was the start of}} his career in theatre. On 16 March 1728, Fielding enrolled at the University of Leyden, but he did not abandon the theatre. His early plays were those of an amateur hobby, but he later returned to London to earn a living. Arthur Murphy, in his 1762 biographical introduction to Fielding's works, believed that Fielding returned to London and <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> theatre as a career because his father stopped an allowance of 200 pounds a year.|$|E
