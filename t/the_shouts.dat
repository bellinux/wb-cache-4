5|$|Once the two ropes are lashed {{together}} {{around the}} binyeomok, the contest begins, to <b>the</b> <b>shouts</b> and cheers of the celebrants. The actual competition is short, with victory usually decided after a single pull (although some contests are played to best of three). Because {{of the association}} of the Western direction with the concept of fertility and fecundity, the match is often fixed to ensure that the West team win (and thus ensure a bounteous harvest). After celebrating at the house of their team's captain, the winners will then proceed to the house of the losing team's captain to offer their commiserations; this often resembles a funeral procession. Both ropes are taken by the winning team, dissected and sold; the straw taken from them is believed to have unusual protective or nourishing properties.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{continued}} {{in single file}} towards {{the top of the}} plateau, with 1 Platoon—under Sergeant Gordon Peterson—leading, followed by 2 and then 3 Platoon. The going was slow in the dense jungle and visibility was limited. By 16:30 the lead section was nearing {{the top of the hill}} having gone just , while the last platoon—3 Platoon—was still leaving the harbour. Suddenly, 1 Platoon was hit by heavy small arms fire from at least three Viet Cong machine-guns in well-sited bunkers, supported by rifles and grenades. The fire engulfed the lead section and platoon headquarters, causing five casualties in the opening minute. Pinned down, the Australians went to ground and began returning fire, allowing all except one of the wounded to crawl to safety. Private Richard Parker, who had fallen directly in front of the bunker system, was unable to be recovered. Failing to respond to <b>the</b> <b>shouts</b> of his comrades, Parker was exposed to further hits, although was probably already dead. To support the beleaguered platoon, Healy subsequently ordered the support section from company headquarters to move forward to provide covering fire, while 3 Platoon moved up on the left flank. However, due to the dispersed patrolling plan adopted, the remaining companies were unable to provide any assistance.|$|E

25|$|The {{captain of}} the Ollie K Wilds stated that the windows of his pilot house were closed, {{and that he did}} not hear the Frosta's horn.

The morning of the accident, the windows were likely closed, and this may have prevented Auletta from hearing the Frosta's horn. Therefore, it is imperative that a lookout be designated and posted outside to listen for and relay signals from other vessels.|$|E

When the university declined to pay his legal fees, Bakke went to court, and on January 15, 1980, was awarded $183,089. Graduating from the UC Davis medical school in 1982 at age 42, he went on to a career as an anesthesiologist at the Mayo Clinic and at the Olmsted Medical Group in Rochester, Minnesota.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>shout</b> feature {{embedded}} in a derivative security resembles the American early exercise feature. In an American option, the early exercise payoff is taken {{to be the same}} as the terminal payoff. For <b>the</b> <b>shout</b> feature, <b>the</b> payoff upon <b>shouting</b> is another derivative with contractual specifications different from the original derivative. In its earliest form, <b>the</b> embedded <b>shout</b> feature in a call option allows its holder to lock in <b>the</b> profit via <b>shouting</b> while retaining <b>the</b> right to benefit from any future upside move in the payoff. The terminal payoff of a shout call option is the form: C = max(ST – K, L – K, 0), where K is the strike price, ST is the terminal stock price and L is some ladder value installed at <b>shouting.</b> <b>The</b> ladder value L is set to be the prevailing stock price St at <b>the</b> <b>shouting</b> instant t (Thomas, 1993). Hence, the terminal payoff is guaranteed to be at least St – K. Obviously, <b>the</b> holder should <b>shout</b> only when St> K. <b>The</b> number of <b>shouting</b> rights throughout <b>the</b> life of the contract may be more than one. Some other restrictions may apply, say, <b>the</b> <b>shouting</b> instants are limited to some predetermined times.

50|$|Upbeat and engaging, shout band music {{consists}} of three sections: the recitive and call, which involves a musical statement from the trombones; the aria, which develops the melody and tempo; and <b>the</b> <b>shout,</b> <b>the</b> ending call-and-response.

500|$|There {{was just}} enough time before nightfall to storm the {{position}} on its north side (mainly up the steepest part of the slope immediately north of Gustavus's fort), but {{not enough time to}} develop simultaneous attacks from other sides. The attack went in around 18:00, led by the advanced guard of the 'forlorn hope'. This force of 80 English grenadiers from the 1st English Foot Guards, led by Viscount Mordaunt and Colonel Richard Munden, was designed to draw the enemy fire and thus enable the Allied commanders to discern the defensive strong points. The main force followed closely behind. [...] "The rapidity of their movements, together with their loud yells, were truly alarming", recalled la Colonie, who, in order to drown out <b>the</b> <b>shouts</b> and hurrahs, ordered his drummer to beat charge [...] "so as to drown them with their noise, lest they should have a bad effect upon our people." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the leak}} {{of the song}} in November 2011, media {{reported}} on {{the similarities between the}} song and singer Nicola Roberts' [...] "Beat of My Drum", due to the [...] "cheerleader-style" [...] verses in both. [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin" [...] has the lyrics [...] "L-U-V Madonna" [...] while Roberts track features the lyrics [...] "L.O.V.E/ Dance to the beat of my drum". Soon after, Roberts called Madonna a [...] "copycat" [...] for the alleged similarities between the songs. However, she later insisted that people had been [...] "quick to jump the gun" [...] and claimed she had not even heard the song. Brazilian music producer Joao Brasil alleged that the chorus of [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin" [...] was plagiarized from his 2011 single [...] "L.O.V.E Banana". Both songs start with <b>the</b> <b>shouts</b> of cheerleaders, who in Brazil's song say [...] "L.O.V.E Banana" [...] and in Madonna's song, [...] "L.U.V. Madonna".|$|E
500|$|The outnumbered {{defenders}} of the Schellenberg had resisted the Allied assaults for two hours, but now under pressure from both Baden's and Marlborough's forces, their stalwart defence was over. As panic spread through the Franco-Bavarian army, Marlborough unleashed 35 squadrons of cavalry and dragoons to pursue the fleeing troops, ruthlessly cutting down the enemy soldiers to <b>the</b> <b>shouts</b> of [...] "Kill, kill and destroy!" [...] There was no easy escape route. A pontoon bridge over the Danube had collapsed under their weight, and many of d'Arco's troops, most of whom could not swim, drowned trying to cross the fast-flowing river. Many others who had been cut off on the northern shore of the Danube ran for their lives amongst the reed-beds, vainly endeavouring to avoid the Allied sabres. Others headed for the village of Zirgesheim, straining to escape to the wooded hills beyond. Only to the west could Marlborough detect a few Franco-Bavarian battalions crossing the Danube by Donauwörth's bridge in tolerable order, before darkness descended over the battlefield.|$|E

500|$|The {{organizers}} received {{permission from}} Rochussen for their meeting {{since they had}} argued that their grievances were social matters, not [...] "matters of state," [...] and {{that they did not}} form a political threat to the government. However, on 20 May van Hoëvell printed the kind of anti-government rhetoric he had been asked to refrain from in a journal he published. [...] There were also signals at other public events of growing unease among the locally born Dutch population as well as the large Indo-European population, who had held protests of their own and delivered a petition to Rochussen. Taking all these developments in consideration, Rochussen concluded that the meeting in De Harmonie should be considered subversive and a danger to the state; he {{let it be known that}} armed troops were ready to take control of the situation if need be. At 6PM on 22 May, people were flocking to the club house, and by 7PM it was packed. Van Hoëvell was quickly proclaimed to be president of the assembly. Soon after, though, the meeting became unruly and <b>the</b> <b>shouts</b> of a few led to a riot. In an increasingly unruly atmosphere, the protestors ousted van Hoëvell from his presidency as quickly as they had raised him to the position, after which he and others left the building.
