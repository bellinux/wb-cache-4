5|$|The Bulgarian {{high command}} {{did not attempt}} to perform a spoiling attack as they lacked the {{necessary}} vehicles and pack animals. The barrage did not cause a significant number of casualties but severely affected the Bulgarian esprit de corps.

5|$|Aware of {{the time}} constraints, Otway decided he could wait no longer, and the reduced {{battalion}} headed for the battery and joined up with Major Smith's reconnaissance party just outside the village of Gonneville en Auge.

5|$|TNA {{held the}} first-ever Barbed Wire Massacre at Turning Point between Abyss and Sabu. TNA advertised <b>the</b> <b>Barbed</b> Wire Massacre between Abyss and Sabu on the November19 episode of Impact!. The {{reasoning}} behind the match stipulation {{had to do}} with Abyss fearing barbed wire in the storyline. Abyss challenged this fear on the December3 episode of Impact!, by bashing Sabu over the head with a barbed wire wrapped steal chair. Sabu defeated Abyss at the event to end their rivalry.|$|E
5|$|The Tank Corps {{was formed}} as the Heavy Section Machine Gun Corps in 1916. Tanks {{were used for}} the first time in action in the battle of the Somme on 15 September 1916.

In November 1916, they were renamed the Heavy Branch MGC and in June 1917, the Tank Corps.|$|E

However, <b>the</b> use of <b>barbed</b> suture is not without risk. There were a few reports on <b>the</b> risks of <b>barbed</b> sutures in <b>the</b> literature. We report herein a case of acute abdomen because of small bowel entrapment and obstruction following <b>the</b> use of <b>barbed</b> suture in laparoscopic myomectomy. Surgeons using barbed suture in myomectomy should be vigilant on the possibility of this bowel complication whenever adverse clinical situation arises as the outcome could be serious if the condition was left unchecked...|$|R

5|$|A 20-foot (6 m) wide ditch was dug at {{the north}} end of the moat to prevent tanks from {{breaking}} through and following the track south past the castle, and a 545-foot by 151-foot (166 m by 46 m) wide anti-personnel minefield was laid to the south-west to prevent infantry soldiers from circumventing the castle's defences and advancing down into Craster. After the end of the war, <b>the</b> <b>barbed</b> wire was cleared away from the beaches by local Italian prisoners of war, although the two pillboxes, the remnants of the anti-tank ditch and some of the trenches and weapons pits still remain.|$|E
5|$|A made-for-television movie, Farewell to Manzanar, {{directed}} by John Korty, aired on March 11, 1976, on NBC. It {{was based on}} the 1973 memoir of the same name, written by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston, who was incarcerated at Manzanar as a child, and her husband James D. Houston. The book and the movie {{tell the story of the}} Wakatsuki family and their experiences behind <b>the</b> <b>barbed</b> wire through young Jeanne's eyes. On October 7, 2011, the Japanese American National Museum (JANM) announced that they had negotiated the rights to the movie, and that they would make it available for purchase on DVD.|$|E
5|$|Each side's {{front line}} was {{constantly}} under observation by snipers and lookouts during daylight; movement was therefore restricted {{until after the}} dusk stand-to and night had fallen. Under the cover of darkness, troops attended to vital maintenance and resupply, with rations and water being brought to the front line, fresh units swapped places with troops moving to the rear for rest and recuperation. Trench raiding was also carried out and construction parties formed to repair trenches and fortifications, while wiring parties were sent out to repair or renew <b>the</b> <b>barbed</b> wire in no man's land. An hour before dawn, everyone would stand-to once more.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, {{during the}} battle of Cambrai, the Tank Corps adopted new tactics. Three tanks working {{together}} would advance in a triangle formation, with the two rear tanks providing cover for an infantry platoon. The tanks were to create gaps in <b>the</b> <b>barbed</b> wire for the accompanying infantry to pass through, then use their armament to suppress the German strong points. The effectiveness of tank–infantry co-operation was demonstrated {{during the battle}}, when Major General George Montague Harper of the 51st (Highland) Division refused to co-operate with the tanks, a decision that compelled them to move forward without any infantry support; the result was the destruction of more than 12 tanks by German artillery sighted behind bunkers.|$|E
5|$|It is now 1945, {{nearing the}} end of the Pacific War. Despite the terror and poor living {{conditions}} of the camp, Jim survives by establishing a successful trading network—which even involves the camp's commander, Sergeant Nagata. Dr. Rawlins, the camp's British doctor, becomes a father figure and teacher to Jim. One night after a bombing raid, Nagata orders the destruction of the prisoners' infirmary as reprisal. He only stops when Jim (now fluent in Japanese) begs forgiveness. Through <b>the</b> <b>barbed</b> wire fencing, Jim befriends a Japanese teenager, who is a trainee pilot. Jim also visits Basie in the American POW barracks, where Jim idolizes the Americans and their culture.|$|E
5|$|Italian gun {{positions}} were located using sound ranging by the British 6th Survey Regiment, Royal Artillery. These positions disclosed themselves by firing at Australian patrols, which now went out nightly, mapping the antitank ditch and <b>the</b> <b>barbed</b> wire obstacles. Aerial {{photographs of the}} {{positions were}} taken by Westland Lysander aircraft of No. 208 Squadron RAF, escorted by Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters of No. 3 Squadron RAAF. British Intelligence estimated {{the strength of the}} Italian garrison at 20 to 23,000 with 100 guns, and discounted reports of six medium and seventy light tanks as exaggerated—a serious intelligence failure.|$|E

5|$|No. 4 Commando {{made the}} {{crossing}} to Dieppe on board HMS Prins Albert. The crossing was uneventful and at 04:50 just before daybreak Group one landed unopposed. Using two Bangalore torpedos to blow {{a hole in}} <b>the</b> <b>barbed</b> wire, they managed to scale the cliffs. As they approached the battery at 05:45 it opened fire on the main landing force coming ashore at Dieppe. This was 30 minutes before Group one {{was expected to be}} in a position but Mills-Roberts responded by speeding up the advance to get their guns into action sooner. Once in position they opened fire on the battery with their mortars, Bren machine guns and sniper rifles. One of the mortar bombs landed inside the battery and exploded the stored charges, putting the guns out of action.|$|E
