50|$|Individuals {{who suffer}} from medial {{temporal}} lobe damage {{have a difficult time}} recalling visual stimuli. This neurotransmission deficit is due, not <b>to</b> <b>lacking</b> perception of visual stimuli but, <b>to</b> <b>lacking</b> perception of interpretation. The most common symptom of inferior temporal lobe damage is visual agnosia, which involves impairment in the identification of familiar objects. Another less common type of inferior temporal lobe damage is prosopagnosia which is an impairment in the recognition of faces and distinction of unique individual facial features.|$|R

5|$|At the {{southern}} part of their range, the Arctic tern has been reducing in numbers. Much of this is due <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> of food. However, most of these birds' range is extremely remote, with no apparent trend in the species as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Historical data {{prior to}} 1700 is sparse due <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> of {{significant}} European settlements along the coastline; the few storms listed are largely records from Roanoke Colony {{and later the}} Province of Carolina. Modern meteorologists believe early storms were tropical cyclones, though due to the time period confirmation is impossible. One theory explaining the disappearance of Roanoke Colony suggests a hurricane destroyed the village, {{though there is no}} evidence to prove the theory. It is considered unlikely due <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> of damage to a fence around the village, on which the villagers left an inscription.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, however—the year bids from {{contractors}} were to {{be entertained}} by the city—the project was halted and the project's engineering staff laid off. Officially, the plan was delayed due <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> of funding, but Hylan and New York City Board of Transportation (BOT) Chairman John Delaney also wanted to secure freight service for the tunnel. The status of the tunnel as mixed-use created tension and deadlock between Hylan, Delaney and the New York State Transit Commission; the latter emphasized passenger service for the tunnel. After an investigation issued by Governor Al Smith, planners eliminated freight service from the plan, as per the Nicoll-Hofstadter Act {{signed into law by}} the governor; this then led <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> of interest from contractors.|$|E

5|$|Much of the inter-war period saw {{economic}} recession or stagnant growth, making fund-raising more challenging. Partially as a result, many memorial projects {{had to be}} cut back or altered due <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> of money. The final size of Douaumont had to be cut in size by a third when fund-raising slowed. Proposals to turn the planned Imperial War Museum into a grand memorial for the war dead were shelved due <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> of funds.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: When {{developing}} {{a catalogue of}} technical requirements for online voting systems {{to be used in}} legally ruled, non-parliamentary elections, major interdisciplinary problems arise which currently cannot be solved. Technical requirements are not yet definable due <b>to</b> <b>lacking</b> legal preconditions, and legal definitions are not yet definable due <b>to</b> <b>lacking</b> technical experience. Problems of this type are the role of a technically necessary intermediate storage of votes, the so-called last call problem and the general problem of ensuring verifiability. The problem of verifiability is discussed from the technical point of view to bring forward a possible solution 1. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{comprehensive}} analysis {{conducted in}} 1980 by Hopson questioned Thulborn's ideas. Hopson {{showed that the}} wear facet patterns on the teeth in fact indicate vertical and lateral rather than back and forth jaw movements. Furthermore, Hopson demonstrated variability {{in the degree of}} tooth wear, indicating continuous tooth replacement. He did acknowledge that X-ray images of the most complete specimen showed that this individual indeed lacked unerupted replacement teeth. According to Hopson, this indicated that only juveniles continuously replaced their teeth, and that this process ceased when reaching adulthood. Thulborn's aestivation hypothesis was rejected by Hopson due <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> of evidence.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed {{as studies have shown}} that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
5|$|A ring Roxy {{inherited}} from Archie, which went missing at Christmas, is planted in Janine's flat.

She realises that Peggy planted the ring {{in an attempt to}} frame her. When Shirley thinks Phil is seeing another woman, she accuses him of only being interested in her for her alibi. He says it is not true, but she drunkenly threatens to withdraw the alibi, and walks to the police station.|$|E
5|$|A skills {{commission}} report released in 2013, backed by Labour MP Barry Sheerman, suggests {{that young people}} were being let down by the education system, with particular criticism aimed towards the lack of information, advice and guidance available to 14-19 year olds.

40|$|Using 12 {{waves from}} the SOEP, this study {{analyses}} if there exists inequity in access {{or in the}} utilisation of health care services due <b>to</b> <b>lacking</b> language skills or due <b>to</b> <b>lacking</b> information about {{the health care system}} (approximated by years since migration) among German first-and second-generation immigrants. The results indicate that years since migration have a slightly impact on the contact decision, but not on the frequency decision. Hence, missing knowledge about the health care system could create additional access barriers and hence yield inequity in access to health care, but not in utilisation of health care services. Regarding the contact decision, German language skills have no influence for the first-generation immigrants, but for second-generation women. Hence, for this group, there exists inequity in the access to health care due to language skills. Regarding the frequency decision, German language skills seem to play a role for the group of first-immigrant men as well as for {{men and women of the}} second-generation: those reporting poor language skills have a significant lower expected number of visits. Hence, there is evidence for inequity in health care utilisation due <b>to</b> <b>lacking</b> language skills...|$|R

On August 22, convection organized while the system was over the western Bahamas, and it developed into Tropical Depression Eleven later that day. Conditions were only marginally favorable due <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> of outflow to its west, but the depression strengthened to reach tropical storm status on August 23.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to {{the stadium}} was the Empire Pool, which hosted the Olympic aquatic events and was the first-ever indoor Olympic pool. The pool was longer than the Olympic {{standard}} of , so a wooden platform had to be built to reduce the overall length.

5|$|After {{handling}} the marketing for Rentjong Atjeh (Rencong of Aceh, 1940), Andjar made his directorial debut in 1940 with Kartinah, a war-time romance starring Ratna Asmara. Academia {{was critical of}} the film, believing it <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> educational value. In 1941 he directed Noesa Penida, a tragedy based in Bali, for JIF; the film was remade in 1988. In these films, he had little creative control, and performed as what the Indonesian entertainment journalist Eddie Karsito describes as a dialogue coach. Camera angles and locations were chosen by the cinematographer, who was generally also the producer.|$|E
