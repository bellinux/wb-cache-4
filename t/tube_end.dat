25|$|Scrubbing tubes: Water {{before and}} after the animal chamber must be removed. One {{arrangement}} would use a large acrylic column of Drierite (8 mesh (scale), i.e., relatively coarse) upstream (before the push pump, before the animal chamber) to dry incurrent airstream and several tubes with smaller mesh (10-20, i.e., relatively fine) Drierite to remove water after the animal chamber. To prepare a scrubbing tube, make sure there is a small amount of cotton {{at either end of the}} tube to prevent dust particles from traveling to the analyzers. Use small amounts of cotton, say around 0.005 g, just enough to keep the dust out of the tubing. Large amounts of cotton will block air flow when/if it gets damp. Pour the Drierite into the tube with a funnel, tap the tube on the bench to pack the grains tightly (to increase surface area - air + water rushes through loose Drierite, requiring frequent changes of scrubbers), and cap off with a small amount of cotton. To remove carbon dioxide] {{before and after}} the animal chamber, Ascarite II is used (Ascarite II is a registered trademark of the Arthur H. Thomas Co.). Ascarite II contains NaOH, which is caustic (so don't get any on your skin and keep away from water). A scrubbing tube is prepared by placing a small amount of cotton into the <b>tube</b> <b>end,</b> filling one-third of the way with 10-20 mesh Drierite, adding a small amount of cotton, then an additional third of the tube with the Ascarite II, another layer of cotton, followed by more Drierite and capping the tube off with another small amount of cotton. Tap the tube on the bench as each layer is added to pack the grains. Note: Driereite can be used over and over again (after heating in an oven), although indicating Drierite will lose color with repeated drying; Ascarite II is used once and will be considered a hazardous waste.|$|E

50|$|A {{theoretical}} basis for computation {{of the end}} correction is the radiation acoustic impedance of a circular piston. This impedance represents the ratio of acoustic pressure at the piston, divided by the flow rate induced by it. The air speed is typically assumed to be uniform across the <b>tube</b> <b>end.</b> This is a good approximation, but not exactly true in reality, since air viscosity reduces the flow rate in the boundary layer {{very close to the}} tube surface. Thus, air column inside the tube is loaded by the external fluid due to sound energy radiation.

25|$|Cold cathode lamps are {{generally}} less efficient than thermionic emission lamps because the cathode fall voltage is much higher. The increased fall voltage results in more power dissipation at <b>tube</b> <b>ends,</b> {{which does not}} contribute to light output. However, this is less significant with longer tubes.

50|$|Field-emission {{electric}} propulsion (FEEP) thrusters use either caesium or indium as the propellant. The design comprises a small propellant reservoir that stores the liquid metal, a narrow tube or {{a system of}} parallel plates that the liquid flows through and an accelerator (a ring or an elongated aperture in a metallic plate) about a millimeter past the <b>tube</b> <b>end.</b> Caesium and indium are used due to their high atomic weights, low ionization potentials and low melting points. Once the liquid metal reaches {{the end of the}} tube, an electric field applied between the emitter and the accelerator causes the liquid surface to deform into a series of protruding cusps ("Taylor cones"). At a sufficiently high applied voltage, positive ions are extracted from the tips of the cones. The electric field created by the emitter and the accelerator then accelerates the ions. An external source of electrons neutralizes the positively charged ion stream to prevent charging of the spacecraft.|$|E
5000|$|To {{start the}} bagging process, a {{horizontal}} sealing bar creates the [...] "Bottom Seal" [...] by clamping {{across the bottom}} edge of the tube, bonding the film together, and cutting off any film below. This sealing bar can be on a fixed height, which is called an intermittent sealing process. Faster systems include a sealing bar that moves down with the bag while sealing. This is called a continuous process. The product is either pre-measured by a multi-head weighing system or the sealed <b>tube</b> <b>end</b> is then lowered onto a precision weighing table and the product to be bagged is dispensed through the long conical tube {{in the center of}} the bag. When the gross weight of the product-filled bag is reached, filling stops, and the horizontal sealing bar seals the top of the bag, simultaneously forming the bottom of the next bag above. This bag is then cut off from the tube and is now a sealed package, ready to advance onward into the product boxing and shipping processes.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unusual}} for the general water {{velocity}} in a system to be so high that impingement attack occurs throughout {{the whole of the}} copper pipework. More commonly, the velocity is just sufficiently low for satisfactory protective films to be formed and to remain in position on most of the system, with impingement damage more likely to occur where there is an abrupt change in the direction of water flow giving rise to a high degree of turbulence, such as at tee pieces and elbow fittings. It is not generally realised how great an effect small obstructions can have on the flow pattern of water in a pipe-work system {{and the extent to which}} they can induce turbulence and cause corrosion-erosion. For example, it is most important, as far as possible, to ensure that copper tubes cut with a tube cutter are deburred before making the joint. Also a gap between the <b>tube</b> <b>end</b> and the stop in the fitting, due to the tube not having been cut to the correct length and fully inserted into the socket of the fitting, can also induce turbulence in the water stream.|$|E
40|$|We study kink {{oscillations}} of thin magnetic tubes. We {{assume that}} the density {{inside and outside the}} tube (and possibly also the cross-section radius) can vary along the tube. This variation is assumed to be of such a form that the kink speed is symmetric with respect to the tube centre and varies monotonically from the <b>tube</b> <b>ends</b> to the <b>tube</b> centre. Then we prove a theorem stating that the ratio of periods of the fundamental mode and first overtone is a monotonically increasing function of the ratio of the kink speed at the tube centre and the <b>tube</b> <b>ends.</b> In particular, it follows from this theorem that the period ratio is lower than two when the kink speed increases from the <b>tube</b> <b>ends</b> to its centre, while it is higher than two when the kink speed decreases from the <b>tube</b> <b>ends</b> to its centre. The first case is typical for non-expanding coronal magnetic loops, and the second for prominence threads. We apply the general results to particular problems. First we consider kink oscillations of coronal magnetic loops. We prove that, under reasonable assumptions, the ratio of the fundamental period to the first overtone is lower than two and decreases when the loop size increases. The second problem concerns kink oscillations of prominence threads. We consider three internal density profiles: generalised parabolic, Gaussian, and Lorentzian. Each of these profiles contain the parameter (Formula presented.) that is responsible for its sharpness. We calculate the dependence of the period ratio on the ratio of the mean to the maximum density. For all considered values of (Formula presented.) we find that a formula relating the period ratio and the ratio of the mean and maximum density suggested by Soler, Goossens, and Ballester (Astron. Astrophys. 575, A 123, 2015) gives a sufficiently good approximation to the exact dependence...|$|R

5000|$|There {{were only}} 50 HK91s {{imported}} in 1974. For these, H&K dropped the month {{from the date}} code {{and replaced it with}} the number [...] "19" [...] in order to completely spell out the year of manufacture. Since they were built on surplus HK41 receivers, the end result was [...] "19/74". For the 1975 models, they stamped the year without the [...] "/" [...] in the middle.The reasons why Heckler & Koch renamed the HK41 in 1974 are unclear. Part of their reasoning could have been that they wanted to change the perception of the rifle as being a semi-automatic sporting rifle instead of a paramilitary rifle. Furthermore, gun laws that were adopted in West Germany around that time prohibited the civilian ownership of paramilitary rifles. (As a side note, HK41s that were sold in West Germany came without flash suppressors because they were prohibited under the West German gun laws). As a result, Heckler & Koch modified the weapon with a plate welded inside the receiver to prevent the mounting of a full-auto [...] "SEF" [...] fire control group and re-designated the rifle as the Heckler & Koch HK91. Late pattern HK41s and HK91s are virtually identical in appearance (except for the receiver markings and the retaining hole of the cocking <b>tube</b> <b>end</b> cap) and all their parts are interchangeable. The last few HK91s that were delivered to the U.S. in 1989 were blocked by customs after President George H. W. Bush issued an Executive Order banning the importation of [...] "non-sporting" [...] rifles. These were slightly modified, to remove [...] "non-sporting" [...] features like the flash suppressor, and the receivers re-stamped as the HK911, forming a transitional model between the HK91 and the HK SR9.The HK91 is rather valuable in the United States firearm market since it was banned from further importation by executive order in 1989. Only 48,817 HK91s were imported into the U.S. prior to 1989. The retail price for an HK91 in the late 1970s was roughly $380 for the standard A2 models and $50 more for the A3 version. Prior to 1979, H&K did limited production runs of HK91s with polygonal rifle barrels. These were only $10 more than their standard counterparts. Today, original HK91s often fetch over $3500. The early 50 1974 [...] "SACO" [...] imports that are in good condition and have the old style [...] "SF" [...] marked grip frame housings can bring a premium and are very desirable among H&K collectors.

The overall length of each machine is 49.53 m (162.5 ft). The generators are rated at 500 MW, 22 kV at 0.85 power factor. Steam {{conditions at the}} H.P. turbine stop valve are 2,300 psig (158.6 bar). at 566 °C with a single reheat stage to the I.P. cylinder of 565 psia (38.96 bar) at 566 °C. The turbine has a design steam consumption of 6.3932 lb/kWh, including reheating, feed heating, and boiler feed pump drive and an overall heat input of 7,543 Btu/kWh. A novel mounting arrangement was adopted for the turbo-generators. The L.P. cylinders are supported on two steel beams about 22.098 m (72.5 ft) long, which bridge between the concrete blocks at the H.P. steam and generator ends of the sets. The fabricated condenser structure was welded directly to {{the underside of the}} L.P. frame using a pre-heated welding technique. This provides a compact arrangement of the condenser and the main set and is {{a major factor in the}} reduction of size related to the output of the machines, which is a striking feature of the turbine hall. The L.P. frame is supported at its corners, each of the supports taking about 203.2 tonnes (200 tons) in weight. The overall weight of the frame and condenser structure is some 2,235 tonnes (2,200 tons) of which 1,422 tonnes (1,400 tons) is supported on the bottom of the condenser by the mounting springs. The condensers were fabricated on site by English Electric from sub assemblies and welded to the bridge beams supporting the L.P. cylinder. There are over 40,000 9.144 m (30 ft) long, 25.4 mm (1 in) diameter aluminium/brass tubes in each condenser, giving an effective surface area of 27,870 m² (300,000 sq ft) the equivalent of 3.9 football pitches. Operation is at 1.3 inHg with 1,023 m³/min (225,000 gal of cooling water at 15.5 °C. Steam is passed to the condenser at over 963.9 t/h (2,125,000 lb/h). Since contamination of the condensate by the cooling water must be avoided, a double tube plate construction has been adopted in which the condenser tubes are expanded into an extra tubeplate in addition to the one forming the side of the water box. The narrow space between the plates is filled with demineralised water, supplied from a header tank from 48.768 m (160 ft). This provides a pressure considerably higher than the 20 psig developed in the cooling water system, so that any leaks on the <b>tube</b> <b>end</b> plates will be supplied from the header tank.|$|E
