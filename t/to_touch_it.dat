Due to security concerns following an attack on the bell by a visitor with a hammer in 2001, the bell is hung out of easy reach of visitors, who are no longer allowed <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>it,</b> and all visitors undergo a security screening.|$|E
5|$|Back at the caves, after {{informing the}} {{survivors}} why {{they went into}} the jungle and that Dr. Arzt (Daniel Roebuck) is dead, Jack decides that he is going after Kate and Locke. Upon reaching the Hatch, he finds no one there and rappels down the shaft on his own. While exploring, he comes across a painted mural, and a wall where the key hanging around his neck is pulled by a strong magnetic force. Finally, after being surprised by a bright light and loud music, he enters what appears to be an underground geodesic dome with computer equipment, including an Apple II Plus computer with its prompt glowing and its shift key relabeled execute. As Jack is about to use it, Locke appears and tells Jack not <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>it.</b> After Jack raises the gun and asks where Kate is, Locke is revealed to be at gunpoint. The gunman threatens that he will shoot Locke if Jack does not surrender. Jack refuses, instead taunting Locke about his destiny. Finally, the gunman steps out and Jack seems to recognize him. The gunman is Desmond.|$|E
5|$|One {{month before}} the final task, Harry and Krum are talking when they {{encounter}} Crouch, who appears to have gone insane, but manages to tell Harry to get Dumbledore. Leaving Krum with Crouch, Harry fetches Dumbledore but returns to find Krum stunned and Crouch gone. Harry returns to preparing for the final task, a hedge maze. Inside the maze, Harry is forced to incapacitate Krum, who has been bewitched, to save Cedric. Working together, the two reach the cup. They agree <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>it</b> at the same time, and doing so, discover {{that it is a}} Portkey that transports them to a graveyard. There, Peter Pettigrew kills Cedric and uses Harry's blood (along with his own hand and Tom Riddle Sr.'s bone) to resurrect Lord Voldemort.|$|E

25|$|Jochanaan {{emerges from}} the cistern and shouts prophecies {{regarding}} Herod and Herodias that no one understands, except Salome when the Prophet refers to her mother. Upon seeing Jochanaan, Salome is filled with an overwhelming desire for him, praising his white skin and asking <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>it,</b> but he rejects her. She then praises his black hair, again asking <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>it,</b> but is rejected once more. She finally begs for a kiss from Jochanaan's lips, and Narraboth, who cannot bear to hear this, kills himself. As Jochanaan is returned to the well, he preaches salvation through the Messiah.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} playing equipment, the major {{adaptation}} is the ball, which is significantly {{larger than a}} standard cricket ball and filled with ball bearings. The size allows partially sighted players to see the ball and the contents allow blind players to hear it. The wicket (stumps) is also larger, to allow partially sighted players to see and blind players <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>it</b> in order to correctly orient themselves when batting or bowling.|$|E

Hightower, under a ghostly form, glowing blue, appears beside it and reaches out <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>it.</b> The idol zaps him with a bolt of green electricity, blasting him backwards past open {{elevator doors}} {{at the opposite end of}} the apartments, where Hightower falls down the shaft, which then fades away, replaced by a star field. The idol turns toward the guests' elevator and laughs before the doors close.|$|E

For example, an individual might see a feather as not touching their skin but still experience the sensation of being tickled when it hovers just above their hand. Other examples include the blowing of wind, gusts of air, and the passage of heat.|$|R

25|$|After dinner, Belle gets {{a tour of}} {{the castle}} {{courtesy}} of Cogsworth and Lumière, her curiosity leads her to enter the West Wing, a place the Beast told her was forbidden. Mesmerized by a mysterious rose floating in a bell jar, she reaches out <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>it</b> but before she can, the Beast stops her and orders her to get out accidentally shoving her in the process. Fearing for her life, Belle flees from the castle. Realizing his deadly mistake, the Beast knows he will be a monster forever if he cannot learn to love her ("If I Can't Love Her").|$|E
25|$|There {{are limits}} {{placed on the}} steps a player may take without dribbling, which {{commonly}} results in an infraction known as traveling. Nor may a player stop his dribble and then resume dribbling. A dribble that touches both hands is considered stopping the dribble, giving this infraction the name double dribble. Within a dribble, the player cannot carry the ball by placing {{his hand on the}} bottom of the ball; doing so is known as carrying the ball. A team, once having established ball control in the front half of their court, may not return the ball to the backcourt and be the first <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>it.</b> A violation of these rules results in loss of possession.|$|E
25|$|Light rail is {{generally}} powered by electricity, usually {{by means of}} overhead wires, but sometimes by a live rail, also called third rail (a high voltage bar alongside the track), requiring safety measures and warnings to the public not <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>it.</b> In some cases, particularly when initial funds are limited, diesel-powered versions have been used, {{but it is not}} a preferred option. Some systems, such as AirTrain JFK in New York City, are automatic, dispensing with the need for a driver; however, such systems are not what {{is generally}} thought of as light rail, crossing over into rapid transit. Automatic operation is more common in smaller people mover systems than in light rail systems, where the possibility of grade crossings and street running make driverless operation of the latter inappropriate.|$|E

25|$|A {{block is}} {{performed}} when, after a shot is attempted, a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball. In almost all variants of play, {{it is illegal}} to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc; this is known as goaltending. It is also illegal under NBA and Men's NCAA basketball to block a shot after it has touched the backboard, or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim. Under international rules {{it is illegal to}} block a shot that is in the downward path of its arc or one that has touched the backboard until the ball has hit the rim. After the ball hits the rim, it is again legal <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>it</b> even though it is no longer considered as a block performed.|$|E
25|$|The {{birth of}} the rank of yokozuna is unclear, {{and there are two}} {{competing}} legends. According to one, a 9th-century wrestler named Hajikami tied a shimenawa around his waist as a handicap and dared any <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>it,</b> creating sumo as it is now known in the process. According to the other, legendary wrestler Akashi Shiganosuke tied the shimenawa around his waist in 1630 as a sign of respect when visiting the Emperor, and was posthumously awarded the title for the first time. There is little supporting evidence for either theory—in fact, it is not even certain that Akashi actually existed—but it is known that by November 1789, yokozuna starting from the fourth yokozuna Tanikaze Kajinosuke and the fifth yokozuna Onogawa Kisaburō were depicted in ukiyo-e prints as wearing the shimenawa. These two wrestlers were both awarded yokozuna licences by the prominent Yoshida family.|$|E

Scherzinger was hesitant at first, stating in an interview that: [...] " [...] I was scared to death <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>it</b> [...] afraid for people to hear it before I even wrote it". Scherzinger put her [...] "heart into writing the lyrics and put in themes from the film Slumdog Millionaire. Love and destiny were elements from the movie that she put into the track". She stated that she [...] "prayed every night to do this right". Fair and Iovine additionally hired Brick & Lace, The Writing Camp and Ester Dean to write their own interpretation of the song.|$|E

500|$|During December 2008, {{while still}} in the process of drafting, Loeb said that he had been riveted by the Bernard Madoff {{headlines}} and showed interest in referencing him in the film, noting: [...] "the thing that is so crazy about this story is that Ponzi schemes seem to be the simplest low-class scam," [...] and [...] "but this was carried out in the highest echelon of high finance. You couldn't even get in to see this guy unless you had $2 million to invest." [...] Stone clarified that Madoff will not be mentioned in the film, commenting that he considered Madoff's actions to be [...] "a crook running a Ponzi scheme" [...] which is [...] "legal robbery." [...] The filmmaker returned to the project in April on the strength of this script, feeling Loeb's draft was [...] "so great" [...] that he did not feel the need <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>it,</b> although he did have the option.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of every quarter and after a goal has been scored, play starts with {{a player in the}} centre position passing the ball from the centre of the court. These [...] "centre passes" [...] alternate between the teams, regardless of which team scored the last goal. When the umpire blows the whistle to restart play, four players from each team can move into the centre third to receive the pass. The centre pass must be caught or touched in the centre third. The ball is then moved up and down the court through passing and must be touched by a player in each adjacent third of the court. Players can hold the ball for only three seconds at any time. It must be released before the foot they were standing on when they caught it touches the ground again. Contact between players is only permitted if it does not impede an opponent or the general play. When defending a pass or shot players must be at least [...] away from the player with the ball. If illegal contact is made, the player who contacted cannot participate in play until the player taking the penalty has passed or shot the ball. If the ball is held in two hands and either dropped or a shot at goal is missed, the same player cannot be the first <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>it</b> unless it first rebounds off the goal.|$|E
500|$|The cap of this {{mushroom}} is [...] broad at maturity. Slightly sticky <b>to</b> <b>touch,</b> <b>it</b> is convex {{in shape}} when young and flattens with age. The colour is generally reddish-brown fading to white in areas near the margin, {{and continues to}} darken as it matures. The stipe, or stem, is [...] in height, and up to [...] thick—rather large {{in comparison to the}} cap; it is club-shaped, or bulges out in the middle. It is finely [...] on the upper portion, but smooth or irregularly ridged on the lower part. The under surface of the cap is made of thin tubes, the site of spore production; they are [...] deep, and whitish in colour when young, but mature to a greenish-yellow. The angular pores, which do not stain when bruised, are small—roughly 2 to 3 pores per millimetre. In youth, the pores are white and appear as if stuffed with cotton (which are actually mycelia); as they age, they change colour to yellow and later to brown. The spore print is olive brown. The flesh of the fruit body is white, thick and firm when young, but becomes somewhat spongy with age. When bruised or cut, it either does not change colour, or turns a very light brown or light red. Fully mature specimens can weigh about a huge specimen collected on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, in 1995 bore a cap of , with a stipe [...] in height and [...] wide, and weighed [...] A similarly sized specimen found in Poland in 2013 made international news.|$|E
