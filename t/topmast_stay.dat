6000|$|Hard {{work and}} excitement? Let the wind baffle and drop {{in a heavy}} tide- way just as you are sailing your little sloop through a narrow draw-bridge. Behold your sails, upon which you are depending, flap with sudden emptiness, and then see the impish wind, with a haul of eight points, fill your jib aback with a gusty puff. Around she goes, and sweeps, not through the open draw, but {{broadside}} on against the solid piles. Hear {{the roar of the}} tide, sucking through the trestle. And hear and see your pretty, fresh-painted boat crash against the piles. Feel her stout little hull give to the impact. See the rail actually pinch in. Hear your canvas tearing, and see the black, square-ended timbers thrusting holes through it. Smash! There goes your <b>topmast</b> <b>stay,</b> and the topmast reels over drunkenly above you. There is a ripping and crunching. If it continues, your starboard shrouds will be torn out. Grab a rope--any rope--and take a turn around a pile. But the free end of the rope is too short. You can't make it fast, and you hold on and wildly yell for your one companion to get a turn with another and longer rope. Hold on! You hold on till you are purple in the face, till it seems your arms are dragging out of their sockets, till the blood bursts from the ends of your fingers. But you hold, and your partner gets the longer rope and makes it fast. You straighten up and look at your hands. They are ruined. You can scarcely relax the crooks of the fingers. The pain is sickening. But there is no time. The skiff, which is always perverse, is pounding against the barnacles on the piles which threaten to scrape its gunwale off. It's drop the peak! Down jib! Then you run lines, and pull and haul and heave, and exchange unpleasant remarks with the bridge-tender who is always willing to meet you more than half way in such repartee. And finally, {{at the end of an}} hour, with aching back, sweat-soaked shirt, and slaughtered hands, you are through and swinging along on the placid, beneficent tide between narrow banks where the cattle stand knee-deep and gaze wonderingly at you. Excitement! Work! Can you beat it in a calm day on the deep sea? ...|$|E
50|$|On rigs having {{multiple}} jibs or staysails {{of which}} at least one is set high, such as many late 19th and 20th Century racing cutters, the uppermost of these, set flying or on a <b>topmast</b> <b>stay,</b> is often called the jib topsail.|$|E
50|$|Coromandel {{measured}} 133 ft x 33 ft x 23 ft. She was a 3 masted square rigged {{ship with}} 13 foresails, 3 top sails, 3 fore <b>topmast</b> <b>stay</b> sails, 2 main sails, 3 main top sails and well found. She had one long boat and two quarter boats. The ship {{was made from}} oak, black birch, and red pine. She was sheathed in yellow metal.|$|E

6000|$|... "There is {{only one}} thing more that I can suggest. I fancy that these tornadoes begin with heavy lightning. Get those wire <b>topmast</b> <b>stays,</b> and twist them tightly round the shrouds and lash them there, leaving the ends to drop a fathom {{or two in the}} water. In that way I don't think that we need be afraid of the lightning. If it strikes us it will run down the wire shrouds, and then {{straight}} into the water." ...|$|R
60|$|Again wheeling, {{this time}} at {{no more than two}} hundred yards, the whale charged back, not {{completing}} her semi-circle sufficiently, so that she bore down upon the schooner's bow from starboard. Her back hit the stem and seemed just barely to scrape the martingale, yet the Mary Turner sat down till the sea washed level with her stern-rail. Nor was this all. Martingale, bob-stays and all parted, as well as all starboard stays to the bowsprit, so that the bowsprit swung out to port at right angles and uplifted to the drag of the remaining <b>topmast</b> <b>stays.</b> The <b>topmast</b> anticked high in the air for a space, then crashed down to deck, permitting the bowsprit to dip into the sea, go clear with the butt of it of the forecastle head, and drag alongside.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was then}} that Fate sent down in a twin-screw shallow-draft gunboat, {{designed}} for the defence of rivers, of some two hundred and seventy tons' displacement, Lieutenant Harrison Edward Judson, to be known for the future as Bai-Jove-Judson. His type of craft looked exactly like a flat-iron with a match stuck up in the middle; it drew five feet of water or less, carried a four-inch gun forward, which was trained by the ship, and, on account of its persistent rolling, was to live in three degrees worse than a torpedo-boat. When Judson was appointed {{to take charge of}} the thing on her little trip of six or seven thousand miles southward, his first remark as he went to look her over in dock was, [...] "Bai Jove, that <b>topmast</b> wants <b>staying</b> forward!" [...] The topmast was a stick about as thick as a clothes-prop, but the flat-iron was Judson's first command, and he would not have exchanged his position for second post on the [...] "Anson" [...] or the [...] "Howe". He navigated her, under convoy, tenderly and lovingly to the Cape (the story of the topmast came with him), and he was so absurdly in love with his wallowing wash-tub when he reported himself, that the Admiral of the station {{thought it would be a}} pity to kill a new man on her, and allowed Judson to continue in his unenvied rule.|$|R
