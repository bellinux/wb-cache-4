5|$|Wind {{causes the}} {{generation}} of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause {{a low level of}} environmental noise. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blowing</b> over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.|$|E

25|$|Diogo Lopes took on lots of {{food and}} left with another ship captained by Jerónimo Teixeira which had just arrived there as well. However, on August 12 they were {{separated}} by a storm, with Captain Lopes ending up at a small peninsula which provided an anchorage well protected by <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blowing</b> that day. Here they found cattle, wild boar, yams and rice provided by the local Malagasy, who were very friendly. This site, known as Taolanara, is where the name of Tolagnaro comes from.|$|E
25|$|The game-time {{temperature}} was 82 degrees Fahrenheit (28 degrees Celsius), with <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blowing</b> out to center field at eight miles per hour. Cliff Lee threw {{the first pitch}} at 8:47 EDT. Starting pitchers Lee and Ben Sheets {{set the tone for}} the game by each throwing two scoreless innings. The game stayed scoreless until the fifth inning when Matt Holliday led off the inning with a solo home run off Ervin Santana to give the National League a 1–0 lead. The NL added a run in the sixth on a sacrifice fly by Lance Berkman to score Hanley Ramírez. The American League finally got on the board in the bottom of the seventh inning on a two-out, two-run home run by J. D. Drew off Edinson Vólquez, tying the game at two.|$|E
25|$|The video {{begins with}} Amy Lee {{dressed in a}} nightgown, barefoot and asleep in a bed within a building, dreaming of falling through the air below a skyscraper. As the chorus begins, the band and Paul McCoy are {{performing}} in another room as Lee awakens and makes {{her way to the}} window. Lee climbs out of the window and climbs the building with <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blowing</b> her hair and dress until she reaches the window of the room where the band is performing. During the bridge, McCoy notices Lee and opens the window, which causes her to lose her balance, and she grabs the ledge. Throughout the bridge and final chorus, McCoy unsuccessfully attempts to pull Lee up, and she falls from his grasp down the building. However, she is then shown asleep in her bed again.|$|E

25|$|Based on the concept, for the {{majority}} Rouvas represents the dark and erotic side of the video, while Tamta the light and innocence. The video begins {{with the image of}} a man in shadows spinning on a chair and holding his head with his hand. It then forwards to a scene with Tamta, wearing leopard print lingerie, looking in a mirror and getting dressed, continuously alternating between these two scenes, while lights flash constantly. As the first verse begins, the shadowy figure is revealed to be Rouvas, with sweat dripping heavily down his face and an unidentified female hand touching him. A new scene is added with Tamta {{standing in front of a}} white background with <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blowing,</b> wearing various loose, flowy costumes, one of which is a Laskaris Haute Couture creation. The scenes constantly alternate between a single frame to a grid. Throughout the video Tamta wears five different costumes. It was also the first music video where Tamta can be seen with her new look.|$|E
25|$|For {{their last}} chance to avoid {{becoming}} the first 0–16 team in NFL history, the Lions traveled to Green Bay, Wisconsin to take on division rivals the Green Bay Packers (whom Detroit had not beaten on the road since 1991). The Packers struck first midway through the first quarter when Deshawn Wynn ran in a career long 73 yard TD. They made it 14–0 when Jermichael Finley caught a 3-yard TD pass {{near the end of}} the first quarter. The Lions got on the board in the second quarter when Calvin Johnson caught a 9-yard TD pass. At the end of the half, Will Blackmon called a fair catch as time expired, allowing Mason Crosby to attempt a rare 69-yard field goal. Crosby kicked it accurately but it fell just a yard short with <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blowing</b> against him. Before the game, Crosby also attempted a 64-yard field goal. Calvin Johnson scored another TD to tie it up in the 3rd quarter when he caught a 14-yard pass. The Packers responded just after the start of the 4th quarter with a 36-yard Mason Crosby field goal, and later with a John Kuhn 5-yard TD catch. The Lions responded less than a minute later with a Kevin Smith 9-yard TD run. The Packers sealed the Lions’ fate though with a 71-yard TD pass caught by Donald Driver.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "2 Become 1" [...] was {{directed}} on the 5-6th November 1996 by Big TV!, in a two-day shoot located at {{a studio in}} Old Compton Street, London. Cinematographer Stephen Keith-Roach—who worked in other music videos such as Jamiroquai's [...] "Virtual Insanity" [...] and U2's [...] "Discothèque"—was {{in charge of the}} photography. The shoot involved the group dressed in winter coats, wandering around the studio against a green screen, interspersed with close-up camera angles, so that the backdrop could be superimposed later. To achieve the effect of <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blowing</b> slowly through their hairs, the group was required to lip-synch the song in double time while wind machines were on them.|$|E

500|$|The {{transfer}} of energy between <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blowing</b> {{over the surface}} of an ocean and the ocean's upper layer is an important element in wave dynamics. [...] The spectral wave transport equation is used to describe the change in wave spectrum over changing topography. [...] It simulates wave generation, wave movement (propagation within a fluid), wave shoaling, refraction, energy transfer between waves, and wave dissipation. [...] Since surface winds are the primary forcing mechanism in the spectral wave transport equation, ocean wave models use information produced by numerical weather prediction models as inputs to determine how much energy is transferred from the atmosphere into the layer at the surface of the ocean. Along with dissipation of energy through whitecaps and resonance between waves, surface winds from numerical weather models allow for more accurate predictions {{of the state of the}} sea surface.|$|E
500|$|Flower is a {{video game}} {{developed}} by Thatgamecompany and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. Flower, designed by Jenova Chen and Nicholas Clark, was released in February 2009 on PlayStation 3, via the PlayStation Network. PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita versions of the game were ported over by Bluepoint Games, and released in November 2013. An iOS version was released in September 2017, published by Annapurna Interactive. The game {{was intended as a}} [...] "spiritual successor" [...] to Flow, a previous title by Chen and Thatgamecompany. In Flower, the player controls <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> <b>blowing</b> a flower petal through the air using the movement of the game controller. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary windmills. The game features no text or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues.|$|E
500|$|The nave and chancel of {{the church}} were not {{structurally}} divided, and measure 39feet 6inches by 15feet 9inches (12 by 4.8m). The walls are [...] thick. In 1844, it was recorded as having a coved roof, doors {{in the north and}} south walls and windows in the east, north and west walls. It also had a pulpit and an oak screen, [...] high, both dated 1610. The screen had inscriptions in Welsh and Latin, and a note that [...] "Richard Williams of Rhodogeidio who married Marcelly Lloyd at his own charge caused all this worke to be don to the honor of God and his church". A brass plaque, erected in 1609 by Williams in memory of his wife, was moved to the new church. Another screen was later added at the west end to stop <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blowing</b> into the nave, and two windows were added {{on opposite sides of the}} chancel. Two box pews were installed during the 18th century, and a bell (now used by the new church) was added.|$|E

500|$|The video {{opens with}} a bird's-eye view of Mumbai, with Azalea's name and [...] "Bounce" [...] in large yellow text. Scenes with local {{residents}} include a young Indian boy and children playing cricket. Azalea, in a gold bodysuit and Indian inspired clothing, slouches atop an Indian elephant. The song begins with Azalea and a troupe of female Indian dancers entering a darkened Bollywood set for a traditional Indian wedding. Azalea and the dancers, in traditional red saris with bindis, begin belly dancing and modernised Indian dance routines. The scene is intercut with snippets of Azalea walking and dancing in Mumbai's slums. On the Bollywood set, a large Indian family are seen celebrating, drinking and dancing. Azalea (in a green sari) dances in a garden, rides an elephant along city streets and travels in an auto rickshaw, wearing a printed silk blouse, with <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blowing</b> through her hair. Now in a blue sari, she lies on the elephant, gesturing with her hands and dancing next to Indian children on a cluttered platform.|$|E
500|$|... "Hair" [...] has {{received}} mostly positive reviews. An hour before starting the final leg of The Monster Ball Tour, Gaga sent four tracks to Rolling Stone, including [...] "Scheiße", [...] "You and I", and [...] "The Edge of Glory", for a preview. Matthew Perpetua wrote a positive review of [...] "Hair", describing it as another inspirational {{song in the}} mold of [...] "Born This Way", but {{felt that it was}} a bit weirder. Perpetua concluded the review by jokingly adding that the song will become [...] "n anthem for salons everywhere." [...] Jody Rosen from the same publication felt that [...] "although Gaga is not the first singer to create a connection between self-esteem and liberation to free-flowing coiffure, she seems to be the most committed to the idea." [...] Dan Martin from NME classified [...] "Hair" [...] as an empowerment anthem, using the [...] "simple image of <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blowing</b> through a person’s hair to illuminate the album’s Love-Yourself-And-Let-It-All-Hang-Out message way more effectively than the title track. It trumps it once again by being quite the gayest thing you will ever hear for a long time." [...] Tim Jonze from The Guardian felt that the message of [...] "Hair" [...] was not particularly a new one, since the 60's musical Hair also preached the same message. Although he described some of the lyrics as [...] "trite", Jonze opined that [...] "these weaknesses can also be strengths, and there's something admirable about the way the [...] address confused teenagers in search of their identity." [...] Writing for The Vancouver Sun, Leah Collins described the song as [...] "a pumping anthem designed to pump up your follicles with pride." [...] She added that the overall feel of the song was that of retro dance music.|$|E

When the wind reversed as the eye passed the ship broke free and was grounded. [...] The ship was towed to Manila, arriving October 8, 1905, for major repairs including removal and straightening of a number of hull plates and sending the stern frame to Hong Kong for rewelding. Pathfinder was unable to leave Manila for surveys until February 17, 1906.

2500|$|The {{legend of}} <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blowing</b> around the cathedral is as follows: In olden days, the Devil {{flew over the}} ground, riding the wind. Thus he {{caught a glimpse of}} his {{portrait}} carved onto the cathedral: the Tempter, courting the foolish virgins (...) , {{in the guise of a}} seductive young man. It is true that his back opens up and toads and snakes come out of it, but none of the naïve girls notices that [...] nor do many tourists for that matter. Very flattered and curious, the Devil had the idea to enter to see whether there were other sculptures representing him on the inside of the cathedral. Taken captive inside the holy place, he could not come back out. The wind always waits in the square and still howls today from impatience on the places outside the cathedral. The Devil, furious, makes air currents from the bottom of the church to the height of the pillar of angels.|$|E

[...] The vessel was immediately spotted by the personnel at the Coquille River Life-Saving Station, who boarded the steamer and then passed a line to the steamer Favorite. [...] Favorite however {{was not able to}} haul Welcome off the bank, and so the life-savers returned to the life-saving station in the surfboat, where they obtained an anchor, hawser, and cables, then rowed back to where Welcome was stranded. [...] They rigged the anchor to Welcome, and that night, when the tide was high, hove the vessel off the bank without damage. [...] Because the master of the Welcome was unfamiliar with the route, and the night was very dark, the keeper of the life-saving station piloted Welcome down to Bandon.|$|E
