These usually went without incident, but on one occasion a vicar asked <b>them</b> <b>why</b> they were filming on church property. They lied by telling him that they were students filming a documentary on churches. Marketing campaigns also incorporated Sony Cambridge Studio's humour.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc {{objected to}} the use of his troops in the attack on Royan in April 1945. As a result, only part of 2e DB was employed. The {{division}} rejoined Seventh Army, crossing the Rhine on 25 April, and joining the pursuit into Bavaria. Leclerc visited Dachau concentration camp after its liberation by the Americans. In an incident that took place 8 May 1945 at Bad Reichenhall in Bavaria, he was presented with a defiant group of captured Frenchmen of the SS Charlemagne Division. He asked <b>them</b> <b>why</b> they wore a German uniform, to which one of them replied by asking why Leclerc wore an American one. Leclerc told his men to get rid of them. That was taken as a death sentence. The group of French Waffen-SS men was summarily executed by the RMT without any form of military tribunal procedure, and their bodies left where they fell until an American burial team collected them. For his services leading the 2e DB, Leclerc was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour.|$|E
25|$|Starr {{took the}} {{position}} part-time and remained active with his law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, {{as this was}} permitted by statute and was also the norm with previous independent counsel investigations. As time went on, however, Starr was increasingly criticized for alleged conflicts of interest stemming from his continuing association with Kirkland & Ellis. Kirkland, like several other major law firms, was representing clients in litigation with the government, including tobacco companies and auto manufacturers. The firm itself was being sued by the Resolution Trust Company, a government agency involved in the Whitewater matter. Additionally, Starr's own actions were challenged because Starr had, on one occasion, talked with lawyers for Paula Jones, who was suing Bill Clinton over an alleged sexual assault. Starr had explained to <b>them</b> <b>why</b> he believed that sitting U.S.presidents are not immune to civil suit.|$|E

25|$|Along with asking moral questions, Slaughterhouse-Five {{is also a}} {{novel that}} focuses on the philosophies of fate and free will. In the novel, Billy Pilgrim tries to {{determine}} what his role in life is and what the purpose of everything going on around him is as well. When abducted by the Tralfamdorians, Pilgrim asks <b>them</b> <b>why</b> he is chosen among all the others. He questions the fate of the situation and what led up to that point. Billy Pilgrim considers his fate and actions {{to be a part of}} a larger network of actions, his future manipulated by one thing over another based on decision. All things that happen would happen for a reason. Indeed, Pilgrim’s beginning mindset would suggest that he believed in free will, fate, whys, decisions and things happening for reasons. However, many of these thoughts are quickly challenged by the Tralfamadorians' ideology.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographer}} Pausanias {{records that}} Athena placed the infant Erichthonius {{into a small}} chest (cista), which she entrusted {{to the care of}} the three daughters of Cecrops: Herse, Pandrosos, and Aglauros of Athens. She warned the three sisters not to open the chest, but did not explain to <b>them</b> <b>why</b> or what was in it. Aglauros, and possibly one of the other sisters, opened the chest. Differing reports say that they either found that the child itself was a serpent, that it was guarded by a serpent, that it was guarded by two serpents, or that it had the legs of a serpent. In Pausanias's story, the two sisters were driven mad by the sight of the chest's contents and hurled themselves off the Acropolis, dying instantly, but an Attic vase painting shows them being chased by the serpent {{off the edge of the}} cliff instead. Erichthonius was one of the most important founding heroes of Athens and the legend of the daughters of Cecrops was a cult myth linked to the rituals of the Arrhephoria festival.|$|E

While her sister was on trial, Maureen—eight months pregnant—was attacked in the lift of the building in which she and David lived. Their home was vandalised, and hate mail was regularly posted through their letterbox. Maureen feared for her children: [...] "I couldn't let my children out of my sight when they were little. They were too young to tell <b>them</b> <b>why</b> they had to stay in, to explain why they couldn't go out to play like all the other children." ...|$|E

Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine has described Francis's writing as containing [...] "bizarre, fragmented lyrics about space, religion, sex, mutilation, and pop culture". Biblical {{violence is a}} theme of Doolittles [...] "Dead" [...] and [...] "Gouge Away"; Francis told a Melody Maker interviewer, [...] "It's all those characters in the Old Testament. I'm obsessed with <b>them.</b> <b>Why</b> it comes out so much I don't know."

500|$|Reflecting Zappa's eclectic {{approach}} to music, the next album, Cruising with Ruben & the Jets (1968), was very different. It represented {{a collection of}} doo-wop songs; listeners and critics were not sure whether the album was a satire or a tribute. Zappa later noted that the album was conceived in the way Stravinsky's compositions were in his neo-classical period: [...] "If he could take the forms and clichés of the classical era and pervert <b>them,</b> <b>why</b> not do the same... to doo-wop in the fifties?" [...] A theme from Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring is heard during one song.|$|E

Kristen asks <b>them</b> <b>why</b> they are doing this, to which the blonde woman replies, [...] "because you were home". The strangers then unmask themselves to the couple offscreen, and take turns stabbing the couple in the stomach and chest before leaving. They drive past two young boys on bicycles who are distributing religious tracts. Dollface asks for a tract. The boy asks if she's a sinner and she replies, [...] "sometimes". The strangers drive away, as the pin-up girl states, [...] "it'll be easier next time".

500|$|Variety {{discussed}} a possible sequel, saying {{it could happen}} if Speed Racer had a good box office performance. In 2008, a possible sequel was contemplated by the Wachowskis when Rain asked <b>them</b> <b>why</b> his character is so happy for Speed winning, and they replied it could be explained in the next film. Rain said he was hired for 3 years, while noting that doesn't guarantee a sequel will be released. Christina Ricci also considered it a possibility; she stated [...] "When we [...] were all leaving, we were like 'write the sequel!' 'We want to come back'. And they [...] were like, 'I know. I know. We're going to. Don't worry'.", adding she would like more action scenes to her character. The producer Joel Silver said that the Wachowskis [...] "have a great story idea for a sequel" [...] {{but that it is}} [...] "a great idea for a sequel if it makes sense to make it." ...|$|E
500|$|Cameron was {{an atheist}} {{in his early}} teens. When he was 17, {{during the height of}} his career on Growing Pains, he became a born-again Christian. After {{converting}} to Christianity, he began to insist that storylines be edited to remove anything he thought too adult or inappropriate in Growing Pains. After the series was cancelled, Cameron did not maintain contact with his former co-stars, and did not speak to Tracey Gold for eight years. Cameron has stated that this was not due to any animosity on his part toward any of his former cast-members, but an outgrowth of his desire {{to start a new life}} away from the entertainment industry, and the life he had been in for the previous seven years. Prior to the premiere of The Growing Pains Movie in 2000, for which the entire main cast reunited, Cameron described his regrets over how his relationship with his castmates changed after his religious conversion during production of the series, saying, [...] "I definitely kind of made an about-face, going toward another aspect of my life", admits Cameron. [...] "I shifted my focus from 100% on the show, to 100% on , and left 0% on the show—and even the friendships that were a part of that show. If I could go back, I think I could make decisions that were less inadvertently hurtful to the cast—like talking and explaining to <b>them</b> <b>why</b> I just wanted to have my family at my wedding." ...|$|E
