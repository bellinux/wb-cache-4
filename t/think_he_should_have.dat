25|$|Military historians {{continue}} {{to pay attention to}} his battlefield tactics and maneuvering, though many <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> designed better strategic plans for the Confederacy.

2500|$|Later, Dick lit a {{cigarette}} and blew smoke in Jen's direction while she was eating. Jen asked for Dick to stop, but he did not. Jen then reached to get the cigarette from Dick several times to which Dick began to burn Jen with his cigarette. Jen began to yell that Dick burned her on purpose. This incident ended with Dick yelling at Jen. Jen burst into tears and Jameka pulled Jen away from the confrontation and to the bathroom. Neither Jen nor Dick was expelled from the House and Jen was evicted on Day 55. Jen said to the Associated Press: [...] "I definitely <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been kicked out, but obviously he was definitely entertainment for the show, so that's why he was not." ...|$|E

5000|$|In the {{foreword}} to the book's 30th-anniversary edition, Dawkins said he [...] "can readily {{see that}} book's title might give an inadequate impression of its contents" [...] and in retrospect <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> taken Tom Maschler's advice {{and called the}} book The Immortal Gene.|$|R

50|$|A bartender, Doug, gets Ted and Barney {{involved}} {{in a fight with}} a group of guys sitting in the gang's favorite booth. Marshall and Lily try to warn them off, but Barney vows to join in when Robin reveals that she thinks fights are sexy. Ted joins in as an experience <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> sometime in his life.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The Gods {{have given}} him a good mind, at least' said the father proudly. 'To <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> listened so cleverly. Yonder is thy Temple. Now I am a poor man--many priests have dealt with me--but my son is my son, and if a gift to thy master can cure him--I am at my very wits' end.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "it is {{perfectly}} delightful {{that he should}} have made your acquaintance. It isn't that at all. But I do not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> made use of you in the way he did. He is utterly reckless sometimes and forgets what he is doing. It is all very well for himself, but he has no right to expose you to--to--" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{finished}} {{brushing his}} clothes, and then packed his [...] "valise," [...] by rolling the different articles carefully in the newspaper. Then, {{instead of going}} away, as Skip and his friends seemed to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done {{as soon as they}} arrived, he stood with his hands on his hips, as if waiting for them to take their departure. For a minute no one spoke, and the silence was really painful.|$|E
60|$|There is {{the real}} President of the Committee,--there the most active, {{efficient}} member of it. They are both of one opinion concerning their situation: and I think this opinion of Mr. Anderson is still more strong; for, as <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> written {{it with a little}} more guard, but <b>should</b> <b>have</b> agreed in substance, you must naturally think the strongest expression the truest representation of the circumstance.|$|R

6000|$|... "To <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> formed so {{foolish and}} cruel and fatal an attachment," [...] the widow said, [...] "which can but end in pain {{whatever}} be the issue." ...|$|R
60|$|You told me, if I {{remember}} rightly, {{that one}} of the members of the original meeting denounced me as an arch-heretic[170]--meaning, doubtless, an arch-pagan; for a heretic, or sect-maker, is of all terms of reproach the last that can be used of me. And I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been answered that it was precisely as an arch-pagan that I ventured to request a more intelligible and more unanimous account of the Christian Gospel from its preachers.|$|E
6000|$|If not, suppose some few gentlemen in the House of Commons, {{and to be}} sure {{very few}} they were, who {{publicly}} declared their dislike to it, or entered into any resolution; this, I <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> explained, and not insinuated so gross a reflection on a {{great majority of the}} House of Commons, who first passed this law, and have ever since opposed all attempts to repeal it; these are the gentleman whom, in sarcasm and irony, he is pleased to call the [...] "worthy," [...] that is, the unworthy patriots themselves.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poulter {{has been}} very good to me. He taught me to play on it,' said Lance; 'that is, he showed me a little; but Robin made me lock it up and give her the key all last spring, for fear of {{hindering}} my mugging; and I can't touch her now, so she {{has been very}} little use to me. I promised Poulter, and I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> her. Besides, I want the money slick at once. It's no good sticking it in a window to wait for some one to give what it is worth.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We made a sad {{mess with}} that old bull to-day, Dick," [...] he said. [...] "It is humiliating to <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> charged us all, injured Tom, and got away almost unscathed." ...|$|R

Also sending plant of 'Campanuta punctata'. Account of discussion with [Joseph] Sabine on roses...|$|R
50|$|By far {{the most}} common outcome for {{separated}} children is a grant of discretionary leave to remain. Discretionary leave to remain is provided most frequently when there are inadequate return arrangements for these children in their country of origin. This leave to remain is usually granted for three years or until the young person reaches 17 ½, whichever is sooner. The child may appeal if <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been granted refugee status or humanitarian protection, but only if he was initially granted more than twelve months’ leave. It {{should be noted that}} both grants of humanitarian protection and of discretionary leave are still rejection of asylum claims, so the young people granted either of these have the right to appeal this decision.|$|R
60|$|If it hadn't {{been for}} the unrequited {{kindness}} of these mere savage Namaquas, Granville cried to himself in his bitterness, he might have died of want in the open desert. And now he would {{go down to the}} coast, after all, a ruined man, penniless and friendless. It was a hard thought indeed for a Kelmscott to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been abandoned and robbed by his own half-brother, and should owe his life now to a heathen African. The tender mercies of a naked barbarian in a mud-built hut were better than the false friendship of his father's son, the true heir of Tilgate.|$|E
60|$|Certainly, when Satan {{first made}} the Attempt upon Eve, {{he did not}} <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> so easily conquered her, or have brought his Business about so soon; the Devil himself could not have {{imagined}} {{she should have been}} so soon brought to forget the Command given, or at least who gave it, and have ventur'd to transgress against him, and made her forget that GOD had told her, it should be Death to her to touch it; and above all, that she should aspire to be as wise as him, who was so ignorant before, as to believe it was for fear of her being like himself, that he had forbid it her.|$|E
6000|$|There {{is a kind}} of rejoicing naïveté in all of James’s {{references}} to the Gowrie affair, which seems to me hardly consistent with his disbelief in his own prowess on that occasion. If one may conjecture, one would guess that the Privy Council and the four preachers managed to persuade themselves, Sprot being the liar whom we know, that he lied when he called his Logan papers forgeries. The real facts may have been concealed from the King. Mr. Gunton, the Librarian at Hatfield, informs me that, had he not seen Letter IV (which he is sure was written by Sprot), he does not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> suspected the genuineness of Letters II and III, after comparing them with the undoubted letters of Logan in the Cecil manuscripts. The Government and the four preachers, with such documents in their hands, documents still apt to delude, may easily have brought themselves to disbelieve Sprot’s assertion that they were all forgeries. Let us hope that they did! ...|$|E
5000|$|Angry, Clamence exits {{his vehicle}} {{in order to}} confront the man when someone else {{intervenes}} and [...] "informed me that I was the scum {{of the earth and}} that he would not allow me to strike a man who had a motor-cycle [...] between his legs and hence was at a disadvantage" [...] (Camus 303-4). Clamence turns to respond to his interlocutor when suddenly the motorcyclist punches him {{in the side of the}} head and then speeds off. Without retaliating against his interlocutor, Clamence, utterly humiliated, merely returns to his car and drives away. Later, he runs through his mind [...] "a hundred times" [...] what <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done — namely strike his interlocutor, then chase after the motorcyclist and run him off the road. The feeling of resentment gnaws away at him, and Clamence explains that ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Robinson is {{certainly}} {{right not to}} break his engagement with Miss Walker," [...] said Sophonisba. Now I had said not a word about an engagement with Miss Walker, having only mentioned incidentally {{that she would be}} one of the party at Innspruck. [...] "But," [...] continued she, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> misled us." [...] And in this way we enjoyed our evening meal.|$|R
50|$|Being cloned from Wolverine's DNA, Logan is {{the closest}} thing Laura has to a father. The pair talk and {{interact}} with each other in ways that are consistent with a father-daughter relationship (even though in New X-Men, Logan introduced her to the students as his sister). Logan acts protective towards Laura and seems to have her well-being at heart, such as when he openly voiced his disapproval of Cyclops putting her on X-Force; he, however, did not force her to leave, though he told Gambit that <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have.</b> When the pair first meet, Logan offers to help her start over at the Xavier Institute and says that he knows better than anyone what she is going through. In the X-23 solo series Logan makes plans to adopt Laura as his daughter. Despite some bumps here and there the two have a strong familial relationship with one another. After Logan's death, Laura officially adopts his codename of 'Wolverine' to honor his memory.|$|R
60|$|WISE. A {{disappointment}} indeed, as ever I think {{poor woman}} had. One {{would think that}} the knave might a little let her have had her will since it was nothing but to be honest, and since she brought him so sweet, so lumping a portion--for she brought hundreds into his house--I say, one would <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> let her had her own will a little, since she desired it only in the service and worship of God; but could she win him to grant her that? No, not a bit, if it would have saved her life. True, sometimes she would steal out when he was from home, or on a journey, or among his drunken companions, but with all privacy imaginable; and, poor woman, this advantage she had she carried it so to all her neighbours that, though many of them were but carnal, yet they would not betray her, or tell of her going out to the Word if they saw it, but would rather endeavor to hide it from Mr. Badman himself.|$|E
6000|$|... “The k——, he laughed,” Frank said, {{pointing}} to the door where the sleeper was, and speaking in a low tone, “I don’t <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> laughed as {{he told me the}} story. As we rode along from Dover, talking in French, he spoke about you, and your coming to him at Bar; he called you ‘le grand sérieux’, Don Bellianis of Greece, and I don’t know what names; mimicking your manner” (here Castlewood laughed himself)—“and he did it very well. He seems to sneer at everything. He is not like a king: somehow, Harry, I fancy you are like a king. He does not seem to think what a stake we are all playing. He would have stopped at Canterbury to run after a barmaid there, had I not implored him to come on. He hath a house at Chaillot where he used to go and bury himself for weeks away from the queen, and with all sorts of bad company,” says Frank, with a demure look; “you may smile, but I am not the wild fellow I was; no, no, I have been taught better,” says Castlewood devoutly, making a sign on his breast.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that put}} me on the track, you see," [...] he said, leaning forward once more. [...] "I thought to myself, if the light was acting, then the whole {{apparatus}} must necessarily have been at work, and the scene as it took place must have been photographed, act by act and step by step, exactly as it happened. At the time the murderer, whoever he was, can't have known the meaning of the flashes. But later, he must have come to learn in some way what the electric light meant, and must have realised, sooner than we did, that therein the box, in the form of six successive negatives of the stages in the crime, was the evidence that would infallibly convict him of this murder." [...] He stroked his moustache thoughtfully. [...] "And to think, too," [...] he went on with a somewhat sheepish air, [...] "we should have had those photographs there in our power all those days and nights, and have let them in the end slip like that through our fingers! To <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> found it out sooner than we! To think that an amateur like the murderer should have outwitted us!" ...|$|E
60|$|As the Marquis of Farintosh seemed {{inclined}} to prolong his visit, {{and his company}} was exceedingly disagreeable to Clive, the latter took his departure for an afternoon walk, consoled to <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> Ethel to himself at the evening's dinner, when Lady Anne would be occupied about Sir Brian, and would be sure to be putting the children to bed, and, in a word, {{would give him a}} quarter of an hour of delightful tete-a-tete with the beautiful Ethel.|$|R

Yet I trust that I {{may be able to}} reach Brockenhurst to-night, where I may have all that heart can desire; for oh! sir, but my son is a fine man, with a kindly heart of his own, and it is as good as food to me to <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a doublet of Lincoln green to his back and be the King's own paid man." ...|$|R
5000|$|After Clark leaves Garrick, Impulse sits {{silently and}} watches the speed storm on the horizon. Impulse decides to go help Clark. Before he leaves, he tells Impulse that he heard the same names that Impulse did {{the first time he}} got his powers. Jay tells him that the speed force is {{something}} that binds all the speedsters together. Impulse then runs off. Later, Garrick and Clark meet at the JSA brownstone and talk about Impulse and Carter. Clark tells him not to blame himself, but Garrick <b>thinks</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done something about it years ago.|$|R
60|$|One day a youth {{started off}} from his native village, {{resolved}} never to come back till he had done some great deed that would make his name famous. But adventures did not seem very plentiful just then, and he wandered about {{for a long time}} without meeting either with fierce giants or distressed damsels. At last he saw in the distance a wild mountain, half covered with a dense forest, and thinking that this promised well at once took the road that led to it. The difficulties he met with--huge rocks to be climbed, deep rivers to be crossed, and thorny tracts to be avoided--only served to make his heart beat quicker, for he was really brave all through, and not merely when he could not help himself, like a great many people. But in spite of all his efforts he could not find {{his way out of the}} forest, and he began to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to pass the night there. Once more he strained his eyes to see if there was no place in which he could take shelter, and this time he caught sight of a small chapel in a little clearing. He hastened quickly towards it, and curling himself up in a warm corner soon fell asleep.|$|E

60|$|By mid-day {{his mood}} had changed {{to one of}} extreme {{tenderness}} and humility, {{and he began to}} entertain unusual misgivings as to his worthiness. He went home to lunch depressed by a sense of his shortcomings; but, on his return, his soaring spirits got the better of him again. Filled with a vast charity, his bosom overflowing with love for all mankind, he looked about to see whom he could benefit; and Bassett entering the room at that moment was sacrificed without delay. Robert Vyner was ashamed to <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> left the lad’s valuable services unrewarded for so long.|$|R
5000|$|The {{novel is}} written {{primarily}} {{about a girl}} called Jackie, later revealed to be formally named Jacqueline, who has convinced a man known only in the book as [...] "the Dragonslayer" [...] {{to allow her to}} be his apprentice and to work with her along with his taciturn assistant, Ron. At the beginning, the Dragonslayer repeatedly <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> accepted her as his apprentice, believing himself mad to have taken on not only a woman, but a teenage girl, but as the story progresses, he becomes more comfortable with her and sees she really is not bad at the job of a Dragonslayer.|$|R
5000|$|Dr Fong {{was brought}} back in {{distance}} for the 153rd {{running of the}} St James's Palace Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot on 16 June. The 2/1 favourite was the Peter Chapple-Hyam trained Victory Note who had won the Poule d'Essai des Poulains on his last start with Dr Fong next in the betting on 4/1 alongside the Irish 2000 Guineas winner Desert Prince. The best of the other five runners appeared to be Fa-Eq (runner up in the Irish Guineas) and the Duke of Devonshire's Duck Row. Fallon restrained the colt towards the rear as Desert Prince set the pace, before making his challenge on the outside in the straight. He caught Desert Prince in the final strides and won by a neck, with a gap of {{three and a half}} lengths back to Duck Row in third place. After the race Cecil commented [...] "Kieren was a bit upset about his ride in France and <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> won. But I was very pleased with him here- he showed what a great jockey he is". In July Dr Fong ran in France again when he carried top weight of 130 pounds in the Prix Eugene Adam over 2000 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse, with his main opponent appearing to be the Prix Noailles winner Special Quest. He took the lead 200 metres out but hung to the left as he tired in the closing stages and prevailed by only a nose from the Pascal Bary-trained Aware.|$|R
