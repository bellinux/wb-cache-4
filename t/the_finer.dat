5|$|Coarse or {{carpet wool}} sheep are {{those with a}} medium to long length wool of {{characteristic}} coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of <b>the</b> <b>finer</b> breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders {{of this type of}} sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes. Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.|$|E
5|$|Decorative {{arts for}} luxury {{consumers}} included fine pottery, silver and bronze vessels and implements, and glassware. The {{manufacture of pottery}} {{in a wide range}} of quality was important to trade and employment, as were the glass and metalworking industries. Imports stimulated new regional centres of production. Southern Gaul became a leading producer of <b>the</b> <b>finer</b> red-gloss pottery (terra sigillata) that was a major item of trade in 1st-century Europe. Glassblowing was regarded by the Romans as originating in Syria in the 1st century BC, and by the 3rd century Egypt and the Rhineland had become noted for fine glass.|$|E

5|$|A {{collaboration}} between the Welland Rivers Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Environment Agency {{has resulted in the}} construction of a rock ramp, to allow migrating sea trout to pass up the river beyond the weir on the Maxey Cut, which was acting as a barrier. Some 300 tons of rock, with 50 tons of finer material forming a top layer, were used to create the ramp. <b>The</b> <b>finer</b> material ensures that water mainly flows over the ramp, rather than through it. The ramp also enables young eels or elvers to move up the river, and provides habitat for stone loach and bullheads.|$|E
5|$|During the floods, {{flow through}} the narrow Wallula Gap was {{restricted}} such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis, which formed in the lowlands of the Columbia Plateau. Lake Lewis backflooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River valleys. This flooding lasted {{for a period of}} 4–7 days. In the relatively calm arms of the lake, the slack waters were thick with suspended materials eroded from the scablands above. Some of the suspended materials settled out, creating thick Touchet Formation layers, or rhythmites, which are found throughout these valleys. The larger clasts settled out first, followed by <b>the</b> <b>finer</b> ones. This resulted in layers with graded bedding, or bedding in which the larger particles are at the bottom and the smaller ones are at the top.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces of tesserae. The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, tessellated opus tessellatum using large pieces of tesserae, on average eight millimeters square, and <b>the</b> <b>finer</b> opus vermiculatum using pieces of tesserae smaller than four millimeters square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss flagstones. Pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. Thin strips of lead set into the cement are often used to distinguish the contours of geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor {{it to the ground}} and gather water and {{nutrients}} to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch {{out of the side of}} this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of <b>the</b> <b>finer</b> roots are single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the uniform}} jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of gray or brown fabric, with a {{six to nine}} button front. The design of the garment {{featured}} several variations: a four to six piece body, {{and one or two}} piece sleeves, usually with lining, often of a cotton material. The fabric used in these jackets, ranged from <b>the</b> <b>finer</b> kerseys and broadcloths used early in the war, to the cotton/wool blends of jeans, satinette, and cassimere, to name several examples. The exact color of the fabric also ranged from the prewar bright cadet gray, similar to the fabric used by Virginia Military Institute, or West Point U.S. Military Academy dress uniforms, to the sumac and logwood dyed fabrics, that would eventually fade to the ragged butternut appearance. Epaulettes may have been used {{in the construction of the}} jacket, as was the case for the Richmond clothing bureau designed jackets, commonly called today, the Richmond Depot types I, II, and III. Belt loops were also in intermittent use, such as the Richmond and the Charleston clothing depots. Trimming on the jackets range from piped or taped collars, cuffs, and front lapel edges, to full facings on the collar and cuffs, commonly in light blue, dark blue, red, or black. Due to the difficulty in obtaining yellow dye ingredients as the war progressed, yellow was infrequently used by the Cavalry Corps throughout the conflict.|$|E
50|$|First, the cjib {{will send}} <b>the</b> convict <b>the</b> <b>fine.</b> If <b>the</b> convict pays <b>the</b> <b>fine</b> <b>the</b> case is closed (by paying, the covict loses {{the right to}} go into appeal as well), if he doesn't, the case will be continued. The cjib will then send the convit a {{reminder}}, though this reminder will contain an increasement of €15. If this doesn't lead to the payment of <b>the</b> <b>fine,</b> <b>the</b> cjib will send another reminder, now with a raise of 20%, however, the raise must be at least €30. When <b>the</b> <b>fine</b> continues to be unpaid, the cjib will enable a bailiff in order to collect <b>the</b> <b>fine</b> nonetheless. This bailiff may e.g. seize the convict's income and sell his possisions. If these measures do not result into the full collection of <b>the</b> <b>fine,</b> <b>the</b> bailiff will return the case to the prosecutor. The prosecutor will order the police to arrest the convict, in order to execute the earlier written substitute imprisonment. The length of the imprisonment will be percentage-wise reduced if the convict has paid a sum, but not the entire amount of <b>the</b> <b>fine.</b> After <b>the</b> substitute imprisonment the convict will be a free man again.
