5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} {{as a tool}} of war, <b>there</b> <b>still</b> was a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons. The invention of the horse collar in China during the 5th century AD (Southern and Northern Dynasties) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast collars used in earlier times. The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Having {{decided on}} a {{location}} and date, <b>there</b> <b>still</b> remained the matter {{of what would be}} tested. John Challens, whose weapons electronics group at Aldermaston had to produce the bomb assembly, wanted to know the configuration of Green Granite. Cook ruled that it would use a Red Beard Tom, and would fit inside a Blue Danube casing for air dropping. The design was frozen in April 1956. There were two versions of Orange Herald, large and small. They had similar cores, but the large version contained more explosive. Both designs were frozen in July. The Green Bamboo design was also nominally frozen, but tinkering with it continued. On 3 September, John Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{observations}} of certain globular clusters appeared to indicate, {{that they were}} about 15billion years old, which conflicted with most then-current estimates {{of the age of}} the universe (and indeed with the age measured today). This issue was later resolved when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to stellar winds, indicated a much younger age for globular clusters.

5|$|The Poles {{had little}} {{interest}} or desire {{to support the}} French cause in the distant colonies, once again fighting against people who only desired their own independence. In Haiti <b>there</b> <b>still</b> is a popular myth that many Polish soldiers became sympathetic to the former slaves' cause and deserted the French, supporting Jean-Jacques Dessalines in significant numbers, with entire units changing sides. In fact, the actual desertion rate was much lower; nonetheless about 150 Polish soldiers joined the Haitian rebels. The loss of that many patriotic military personnel in the Caribbean was a serious blow to the Polish aspirations for regaining independence. The Haitian experience cast further doubts among Poles about France's and Napoleon's good intentions toward Poland.|$|E
5|$|The most {{critical}} problem, however, was {{a shortage of}} ammunition for the PAVN's tanks and heavy artillery (field artillery and mortars 85mm or larger in caliber). By 1974, PAVN's entire stock of heavy artillery and tank ammunition, including all ammunition held by combat units at forward warehouses, and in the PAVN's strategic reserves, totaled just 100,000 rounds. The ammunition problem was so serious that the PAVN artillery command had to replace the larger weapons {{in a number of}} units with obsolete 76.2mm and 57mm artillery pieces drawn out of storage for which <b>there</b> <b>still</b> was adequate ammunition.|$|E
5|$|The new European Norm EN144-3:2003 {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} valve, similar to existing 232 bar or 300 bar DIN valves, however, with a metric M26×2 fitting on both the cylinder and the regulator. These are intended to be used for breathing gas with oxygen content above that normally found in natural air in the Earth's atmosphere (i.e. 22–100%). From August 2008, these were required in the European Union for all diving equipment used with nitrox or pure oxygen. The idea behind this new standard is to prevent a rich mixture being filled to a cylinder that is not oxygen clean. However even with use of the new system <b>there</b> <b>still</b> remains nothing except human procedural care to ensure that a cylinder with a new valve remains oxygen-clean - which is exactly how the previous system worked.|$|E

5|$|When the {{protostar}} {{has grown}} {{such that it}} ignites to form a star, the surviving disk {{is removed from the}} inside outward by photoevaporation, the solar wind, Poynting–Robertson drag and other effects. Thereafter <b>there</b> <b>still</b> may be many protoplanets orbiting the star or each other, but over time many will collide, either to form a single larger planet or release material for other larger protoplanets or planets to absorb. Those objects that have become massive enough will capture most matter in their orbital neighbourhoods to become planets. Protoplanets that have avoided collisions may become natural satellites of planets through a process of gravitational capture, or remain in belts of other objects to become either dwarf planets or small bodies.|$|E

On 3 September, Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite. By January 1957, with the tests just months away, a tentative schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was too large to fit into a missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could fit into a Yellow Sun casing that could be used by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another ₤1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, the typhoon was {{forecast}} {{to strike}} areas {{affected by the}} Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Officials prepared by installing a cover to prevent rain contamination. Ultimately, <b>there</b> <b>still</b> was rain contamination, and Ma-on's passage produced 2,000tons of radioactive water. Before the storm struck Japan, officials in Miyakonojō, Miyazaki advised the evacuation of about 900people in areas prone to mudslides. At least 300airline flights were canceled due to the storm. The typhoon also caused delays in the nation's rail system. Nippon Oil stopped shipping oil during the storm. As Ma-on moved across Japan, it produced winds of 108km/h (68mph), along with heavy rainfall of up to 1200mm (48in). Rainfall in a 24‑hour period reached 860mm (38.5in) in Umaji, Kōchi, which set a 24‑hour rainfall record and exceeded the average July precipitation by 265.5mm (10.6in). The rains flooded houses and roads in the region. High rains closed several expressways, and in Shizuoka Prefecture, a blocked road stranded 96mountain climbers. Strong winds left about 11,000people without power on Shikoku Island. The combination of winds and rain damaged the 385‑year‑old Nijō Castle in Kyoto. The typhoon injured 60people, and killed five people. One of the deaths was {{from a man who}} drowned while checking on his boat during the storm. Damage was estimated at ¥3.9billion (2011JPY, $50million 2011USD).|$|E

5|$|The Sommerfeld {{model and}} spin models for {{ferromagnetism}} illustrated the successful application {{of quantum mechanics}} to condensed matter problems in the 1930s. However, <b>there</b> <b>still</b> were several unsolved problems, most notably the description of superconductivity and the Kondo effect. After World War II, several ideas from quantum field theory were applied to condensed matter problems. These included recognition of collective excitation modes of solids and the important notion of a quasiparticle. Russian physicist Lev Landau used {{the idea for the}} Fermi liquid theory wherein low energy properties of interacting fermion systems were given in terms of what are now termed Landau-quasiparticles. Landau also developed a mean field theory for continuous phase transitions, which described ordered phases as spontaneous breakdown of symmetry. The theory also introduced the notion of an order parameter to distinguish between ordered phases. Eventually in 1965, John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and John Schrieffer developed the so-called BCS theory of superconductivity, based on the discovery that arbitrarily small attraction between two electrons of opposite spin mediated by phonons in the lattice can give rise to a bound state called a Cooper pair.|$|E
