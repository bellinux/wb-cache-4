5|$|A First Avenue line, {{consisting}} of four tracks, would stretch from the Harlem River to City Hall. At 10th Street, the line would {{cease to be}} a four-track line, with the line splitting into two branches. One branch would run to a loop near City Hall, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>would</b> go to a new Lafayette Avenue line in Brooklyn, running via Third Avenue and the Bowery. On the northern end, at 161st Street, the line would split into two 3-track lines. One of the lines would go to Southern Boulevard and Fordham Road; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>would</b> continue to 241st Street after merging with the existing IRT White Plains Road Line at Fordham Road and Webster Avenue.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{surrender}} of Oribe, the Allied forces split into two groups, the plan being for one force to maneuver upriver and sweep down on Buenos Aires from Santa Fe, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>would</b> make a landing {{at the port of}} Buenos Aires itself. The first of these groups, was composed of Uruguayan and Argentine troops, along with the 1st Division of the Brazilian Army under Brigadier General Manuel Marques de Sousa (later the Count of Porto Alegre). It was initially based in the town of Colonia del Sacramento in the south of Uruguay across the Río de la Plata estuary from the city of Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|British aero engines were {{normally}} {{equipped with}} a power take-off shaft {{that led to the}} rear of the engine. In twin engine aircraft like the Anson, one of these would be used for a generator that powered the aircraft instruments at 24V DC, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>would</b> be left unconnected and available for use. Following a suggestion from Watt to avoid Air Ministry channels, in October Bowen flew one of the Battles to the Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick) plant in Sheffield, where he pulled the DC generator off the engine, dropped it on the table, and asked for an AC alternator of similar size and shape. Arnold Tustin, Metrovick's lead engineer, was called in to consider the problem, and after a few minutes he returned to say that he could supply an 80V unit at 1200 to 2400Hz and 800W, even better than the 500W requested. Bowen had an order for 18 pre-production units placed as soon as possible, and the first units started arriving at the end of October. A second order for 400 more quickly followed. Eventually about 133,800 of these alternators would be produced during the war.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocines have {{highly unusual}} teeth {{compared}} to other sauropods. The crowns are long and slender, and elliptical in cross-section, while the apex forms a blunt, triangular point. The most prominent wear facet is on the apex, though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods, diplodocine wear patterns are on the labial (cheek) side of both {{the upper and lower}} teeth. What this means is that Diplodocus and other diplodocids had a radically different feeding mechanism than other sauropods. Unilateral branch stripping is the most likely feeding behavior of Diplodocus, as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth (coming from tooth–food contact). In unilateral branch stripping, one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>would</b> act as a guide and stabilizer. With the elongated preorbital (in front of the eyes) region of the skull, longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action. Also, the palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behaviour: 1) an increased gape, and 2) allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows, creating a smooth stripping action.|$|E
5|$|Harold was crowned on 6 January 1066 in Edward's new Norman-style Westminster Abbey, {{although}} some controversy surrounds who performed the ceremony. English sources claim that Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, performed the ceremony, while Norman sources {{state that the}} coronation was performed by Stigand, who was considered a non-canonical archbishop by the papacy. Harold's claim to the throne was not entirely secure, however, as there were other claimants, perhaps including his exiled brother Tostig. King Harald Hardrada of Norway also had a claim to the throne as the uncle and heir of King Magnus I, who had made a pact with Harthacnut in about 1040 that if either Magnus or Harthacnut died without heirs, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>would</b> succeed. The last claimant was William of Normandy, against whose anticipated invasion King Harold Godwinson made most of his preparations.|$|E

5|$|In 627, Honorius was consecrated as {{archbishop}} by Paulinus of York at Lincoln. Honorius {{wrote to}} Pope Honorius I asking the pope {{to raise the}} see of York to an archbishopric, so that when one archbishop in England died, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>would</b> be able to consecrate the deceased bishop's successor. The pope agreed, and sent a pallium for Paulinus, but by this time, Paulinus had already been forced to flee from Northumbria. When Paulinus, {{after the death of}} King Edwin of Northumbria in October 633, fled Northumbria, he was received by Honorius and appointed to the bishopric of Rochester. The papal letter is dated to June 634, and implies that news of Edwin's death had not reached the pope. This evidence may mean that the traditional date of Edwin's death may need to be moved to October 634. The papal letter may also mean that the traditional date of consecration for Honorius may need re-dating, as the long gap between 627, when he {{is said to have been}} consecrated, and 634, when he finally received a pallium, is much longer than usually found. It may be that Honorius was consecrated closer to 634. The papal letter to Honorius is given in the Ecclesiastical History of the medieval writer Bede.|$|E
5|$|In July 1978, amid a {{financial}} crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented the group with two original ideas for their next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>would</b> later become Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former to be their next album. Bob Ezrin co-produced, and he wrote a forty-page script for the new album. Ezrin based {{the story on the}} central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was {{the death of his father}} in World War II. This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person.|$|E

Suleiman also stressed that demonstrators would not be prosecuted and that a separate independent fact-finding committee would be established to probe the violence of 2February. He said that wider press freedoms were under consideration {{and that he would}} produce a list of what was needed to hold free elections. He also said that plans were underway to organize a peaceful transfer of power. Suleiman reiterated his view that Egypt was not ready for democracy, while warning of a possible coup d'état unless demonstrators agreed to enter negotiations.|$|E

5|$|King Edward's {{death on}} 5 January 1066 left no clear heir, and several contenders laid {{claim to the}} throne of England. Edward's {{immediate}} successor was the Earl of Wessex, Harold Godwinson, the richest and most powerful of the English aristocrats and son of Godwin, Edward's earlier opponent. Harold was elected king by the Witenagemot of England and crowned by Archbishop of York Ealdred, although Norman propaganda claimed that the ceremony was performed by Stigand, the uncanonically elected Archbishop of Canterbury. Harold was at once challenged by two powerful neighbouring rulers. Duke William claimed {{that he had been}} promised the throne by King Edward and that Harold had sworn agreement to this. Harald III of Norway, commonly known as Harald Hardrada, also contested the succession. His claim to the throne was based on an agreement between his predecessor Magnus I of Norway and the earlier King of England Harthacanute, whereby, if either died without heir, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>would</b> inherit both England and Norway. William and Harald Hardrada immediately set about assembling troops and ships for separate invasions.|$|E
5|$|On 16 April, an agreement, which {{intentionally}} excluded PAIGC, {{was reached}} with 22 of the 35 opposition parties {{to set up}} a National Transitional Council.

He also said that existing institutions would be dissolved and that two committees would run the country, one would manage foreign affairs and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>would</b> handle social affairs. The former committee was due to meet the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) the following day. The transitional civilian government will rule up to two years before new elections will be held.

5|$|When King Edward {{died at the}} {{beginning}} of 1066, the lack of a clear heir led to a disputed succession in which several contenders laid claim to the throne of England.

Harold was elected king by the Witenagemot of England and crowned by the Archbishop of York, Ealdred, although Norman propaganda claimed the ceremony was performed by Stigand, the uncanonically elected Archbishop of Canterbury.

5|$|While the {{original}} {{plans for the}} Dovre Line involved completion in 1916, {{it was not until}} 1921 the first train could travel from Oslo to Trondheim via Dovre, mostly due to the First World War. The new depot opened in 1916, and in 1917 the double track and dual gauge to Marienborg as well as the new freight terminal was finished. Instead of using one track for each direction on the double track, the Dovre Line would use the one line while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>would</b> be used for transport from the station to the depot. Skansen Bridge opened on 22 March 1918. In 1922, Norsk Spisevognselskap established a kiosk, and on 1 October 1925, they took over the station restaurant.|$|E

5|$|With {{the truce}} and the {{recognition}} {{that he would not}} conquer Denmark, Harald turned his attention to England. England had belonged to Harthacnut, the son of Cnut the Great, until he died childless in 1042. Harald based his claim to the throne of England on an agreement made between Magnus and Harthacnut in 1038, which stated that if either died, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>would</b> inherit the throne and lands of the deceased. When Harthacnut died, Magnus assumed the crown of Denmark and considered himself the lawful heir to Harthacnut. While Edward the Confessor had himself crowned English king in his absence, Magnus had planned to invade England in 1045, only to be forced to turn his fleet towards Denmark due to an uprising by Sweyn Estridsson. Although the threat was temporarily averted by Magnus's death in 1047, Edward's negotiations with his enemies throughout the 1050s gave Harald (as well as Sweyn Estridsson and William of Normandy) an impression that he was a possible heir to Edward. When Edward died in January 1066, he was to Harald's dismay succeeded by Harold Godwinson, a son of one of Edward's advisors.|$|E
