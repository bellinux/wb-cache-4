He graduated in 1969 at the age of 21; in his graduation photograph, he appeared in drag wearing a blue chiffon prom dress and beehive hairstyle. By the end of the decade, the Disquotays had begun to drift apart, with a number of them abandoning cross-dressing and others recognizing that they were trans women and undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Sylvester always considered himself male and began <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> down the feminine nature of his clothing, aiming for a more androgynous look which combined male and female styles and which was influenced by the fashions of the hippie movement.|$|E

2500|$|Testing the {{hypothesis}} that 'conscious intention occurs after movement genesis has already begun' required the researchers to analyse the distribution of responses <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> before actions. The idea is that, after time T, <b>tones</b> will lead <b>to</b> vetoing and thus a reduced representation in the data. There {{would also be a}} point of no return P where a tone was too close to the movement onset for the movement to be vetoed. In other words, the researchers were expecting to see the following on the graph: many unsuppressed responses <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> while the subjects are not yet aware of their movement genesis, followed by a drop in the number of unsuppressed responses <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> during {{a certain period of time}} during which the subjects are conscious of their intentions and are stopping any movements, and finally a brief increase again in unsuppressed responses <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> when the subjects do not have the time <b>to</b> process the <b>tone</b> and prevent an action – they have passed the action's [...] "point of no return".

40|$|Responses {{of single}} neurons in the {{inferior}} colliculus of the chinchilla <b>to</b> amplitude-modulated <b>tones</b> were obtained. In one condition, the modulating waveform was a low-frequency sinusoid (SAM tone). In the other, the modulator was a trapezoid with fixed parameters, {{used to create}} trains of brief tone bursts presented at various repetition rates (TRAM tone). Modulation frequency (or repetition rate) was varied over the range from 10 to 200 Hz. Many individual neurons exhibited strong selectivity for modulator type. Neurons with pauser discharge patterns <b>to</b> steady-state <b>tones</b> usually exhibited greater responsiveness <b>to</b> SAM <b>tones</b> than <b>to</b> TRAM. In contrast, neurons that responded transiently <b>to</b> steady-state <b>tones</b> usually exhibited greater responsiveness <b>to</b> TRAM <b>tones</b> than <b>to</b> SAM. Neurons with sustained responses <b>to</b> steady-state <b>tones</b> responded strongly <b>to</b> both types of modulated tones. The selectivity for modulator type suggests that transient neurons may play a different functional role in the representation of envelopes than do other types of neurons...|$|R
40|$|Responses <b>to</b> <b>tones,</b> clicks, {{and noise}} were {{recorded}} from chinchilla auditory-nerve fibers (ANFs). The responses to noise {{were analyzed by}} computing the zeroth-, first-, and second-order Wiener kernels (h(0), h(1), and h(2)). The h(1) s correctly predicted the frequency tuning and phases of responses <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> of ANFs with low characteristic frequency (CF). The h(2) s correctly predicted the frequency tuning and phases of responses <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> of all ANFs, regardless of CF. Also regardless of CF, the kernels jointly predicted about 77 % {{of the features of}} ANF responses to "frozen" samples of noise. Near-CF group delays of kernels and signal-front delays of responses to intense rarefaction clicks exceeded by 1 ms the corresponding basilar-membrane delays at both apical and basal sites of the chinchilla cochlea. This result, confirming that synaptic and neural processes amount to 1 ms regardless of CF, permitted drawing a map of basilar-membrane delay as a function of position for {{the entire length of the}} chinchilla cochlea, a first for amniotic species...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that the human left planum temporale (PT) {{plays an important role in}} language. To test this hypothesis, functional MRI (fMRI) data were collected from 12 normal right-handed subjects during passive and active listening <b>to</b> words and <b>tone</b> sequences. Several left hemisphere areas, including the superior temporal sulcus, middle temporal gyms, angular gyrus and lateral frontal lobe showed stronger activation during the word conditions. This was not true of the PT, which responded equally <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> and words during passive listening and more strongly <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> during active listening. The PT is likely to be involved in early auditory processing, while specifically linguistic functions are mediated by multimodal association areas distributed elsewhere in the left hemisphere...|$|R
5|$|Carey's debut studio album made {{a strong}} impact on pop music, but the singer became {{interested}} in altering her sound and branching out into other genres for her second studio effort, Emotions (1991). Columbia allowed her to take more control over her musical direction, enabling her to change the musical genre, melodies, and production style. Carey worked with many new musicians and producers on the album; Walter Afanasieff being the only holdover from her debut. Emotions contained influences from 1950s, 60s, and 70s balladry, gospel, R and soul music. The album, while praised by some as being more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort; selling fewer units and failing to introduce Carey into new markets. Columbia decided to return Carey to the same genre as her debut album and have her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly record. Their plans were <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> down Carey's vocals and soften the album's production to create a contemporary pop record. Carey and Afanasieff agreed to the change and began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, Music Box (1993).|$|E

5|$|From January 1996 onwards, Ranariddh's {{relations}} with Hun Sen {{began to show}} signs of tension. Hun Sen submitted a government circular to reinstate 7 January as a national holiday, the anniversary of Phnom Penh's liberation from the Khmer Rouge by Vietnamese forces. Ranariddh added his signature to the circular, which incurred the ire of Sihanouk and several FUNCINPEC leaders. A few days later, apparently <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> down dissatisfaction from party members, Ranariddh publicly accused the Army of Vietnam of encroaching into the territories of four Cambodian provinces bordering it. As Widyono saw it, Ranariddh intended to test Hun Sen's response to his accusations, of which the latter chose to remain quiet. During a closed-door FUNCINPEC meeting in the later part of January 1996, party members criticised Hun Sen and the CPP for monopolizing government power, and also chided Ranariddh for being too subservient to Hun Sen.|$|E
40|$|II. Auditory nerve. Low-frequency neurons in the {{inferior}} colliculus (IC) show a damped oscillatory response {{as a function}} of interaural time differences (ITDs) of broadband noise. It was previously shown that several features of such noise-delay functions are well predicted by the composite curve, generated by the linear summation of responses <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> with varying ITD. This indicates a surprising degree of linearity at the midbrain level of the auditory pathway. A similar comparison between responses <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> and <b>to</b> noise has not been made at a more peripheral, monaural level and it is therefore unclear to what extent this linearity reflects peripheral physiology. Here, we compare cat auditory nerve responses to broadband noise and <b>to</b> isolevel <b>tones.</b> We constructed shuffled autocorrelograms for responses <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> and summed across frequencies to obtain a monaural composite curve. We then compare this composite curve to the shuffled autocorrelogram of responses to broadband noise and find that the match between tonal and noise responses is poorer {{at the level of the}} auditory nerve than at the level of the IC. The apparent linearity of responses in the IC is thus even more surprising than was apparent from its original report because it results from mechanisms interposed between the auditory nerve and the IC. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The core {{difficulty}} in developmental dyslexia across languages is a “phonological deficit”, a specific {{difficulty with the}} neural representation of the sound structure of words. Recent data across languages suggest that this phonological deficit arises in part from inefficient auditory processing of {{the rate of change}} of the amplitude envelope at syllable onset (inefficient sensory processing of rise time). Rise time is a complex percept that also involves changes in duration and perceived intensity. Understanding the neural mechanisms that give rise to the phonological deficit in dyslexia is important for optimising educational interventions. In a three-deviant passive ‘oddball’ paradigm and a corresponding blocked ‘deviant-alone’ control condition we recorded ERPs <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> varying in rise time, duration and intensity in children with dyslexia and typically developing children longitudinally. We report here results from test Phases 1 and 2, when participants were aged 8 – 10 years. We found an MMN to duration, but not to rise time nor intensity deviants, at both time points for both groups. For rise time, duration and intensity we found group effects in both the Oddball and Blocked conditions. There was a slower fronto-central P 1 response in the dyslexic group compared to controls. The amplitude of the P 1 fronto-centrally <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> with slower rise times and lower intensity was smaller compared <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> with sharper rise times and higher intensity in the Oddball condition, for children with dyslexia only. The latency of this ERP component for all three stimuli was shorter on the right compared to the left hemisphere, only for the dyslexic group in the Blocked condition. Furthermore, we found decreased N 1 c amplitude <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> with slower rise times compared <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> with sharper rise times for children with dyslexia, only in the Oddball condition. Several other effects of stimulus type, age and laterality were also observed. Our data suggest that neuronal responses underlying some aspects of auditory sensory processing may be impaired in dyslexia...|$|R
5|$|In Five Songs (1956–57) and Musique funèbre (1958) Lutosławski {{introduced}} his {{own brand of}} twelve-tone music, marking his departure from the explicit use of folk music. His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in Musique funèbre, augmented fourths and semitones). This system also gave him the means to write dense chords without resorting <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> clusters, and enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments. Lutosławski's twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from Arnold Schoenberg's tone-row system, although Musique funèbre does happen {{to be based on}} a tone row. This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and Paganini Variations.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the middle}} of 24s run, the series {{attracted}} significant criticism for its depictions of torture, {{as well as its}} negative portrayal of Muslims. The frequent use of ticking time bomb scenarios in storylines, as well as the main character, Jack Bauer portraying torture as normal, effective, acceptable and glamorous, was criticized by human rights activists, military officials, and experts in questioning and interrogation, with concerns raised that junior U.S. soldiers were imitating techniques shown on the series. In response to these concerns, members of the U.S. military met with the creators of the show. Partly {{as a result of these}} discussions, and the military's appeal to the creators of the show <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> down the scenes of torture since it was having an impact on U.S. troops, there was a reduction in torture in subsequent seasons of the series. However, the writers stated that they reduced the number of torture scenes, not as a concession, but because it was starting to overwhelm the storytelling.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAuditory stream {{segregation}} {{describes the}} way that sounds are perceptually segregated into groups or streams {{on the basis of}} perceptual attributes such as pitch or spectral content. For sequences of pure tones, segregation depends on the tones' proximity in frequency and time. In the auditory cortex (and elsewhere) responses <b>to</b> sequences of <b>tones</b> are dependent on stimulus conditions in a similar way to the perception of these stimuli. However, although highly dependent on stimulus conditions, perception is also clearly influenced by factors unrelated to the stimulus, such as attention. Exactly how ‘bottom-up’ sensory processes and non-sensory ‘top-down’ influences interact is still not clear. Here, we recorded responses <b>to</b> alternating <b>tones</b> (ABAB …) of varying frequency difference (FD) and rate of presentation (PR) in the auditory cortex of anesthetized guinea-pigs. These data complement previous studies, in that top-down processing resulting from conscious perception should be absent or at least considerably attenuated. Under anesthesia, the responses of cortical neurons <b>to</b> the <b>tone</b> sequences adapted rapidly, in a manner sensitive to both the FD and PR of the sequences. While the responses <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> at frequencies more distant from neuron best frequencies (BFs) decreased as the FD increased, the responses <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> near <b>to</b> BF increased, consistent with a release from adaptation, or forward suppression. Increases in PR resulted in reductions in responses <b>to</b> all <b>tones,</b> but the reduction was greater for tones further from BF. Although asymptotically adapted responses <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> showed behavior that was qualitatively consistent with perceptual stream segregation, responses reached asymptote within 2  s, and responses <b>to</b> all <b>tones</b> were very weak at high PRs (> 12  tones per second). A signal-detection model, driven by the cortical population response, made decisions that were dependent on both FD and PR in ways consistent with perceptual stream segregation. This included showing a range of conditions over which decisions could be made either in favor of perceptual integration or segregation, depending on the model ‘decision criterion’. However, the rate of ‘build-up’ was more rapid than seen perceptually, and at high PR responses <b>to</b> <b>tones</b> were sometimes so weak as to be undetectable by the model. Under anesthesia, adaptation occurs rapidly, and at high PRs tones are generally poorly represented, which compromises the interpretation of the experiment. However, within these limitations, these results complement experiments in awake animals and humans. They generally support the hypothesis that ‘bottom-up’ sensory processing {{plays a major role in}} perceptual organization, and that processes underlying stream segregation are active in the absence of attention...|$|R
