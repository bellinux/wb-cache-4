On 20 August, Mido made a disappointing debut for Zamalek, wasting a second-half penalty as Zamalek threw away their lead <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> late 2–1 home victory to Petrojet in the Egyptian Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} three East Bosnian Shock Battalions, the Partisan General Staff of Bosnia-Herzegovina first {{attempted}} to cross the Bosna to follow the Partisan Supreme Headquarters and main force to western Bosnia, but instead retreated to Birač, where they joined forces with the Birač Detachment {{at the end of}} May. The Birač Partisan Detachment was the only Partisan or volunteer detachment in East Bosnia not <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> pro-Chetnik coup in March–May 1942. By June–July 1942, the Partisans in eastern Bosnia had been reduced to a strength of around 600 fighters.|$|E

5|$|Forecasters and {{computer}} models at the Miami-based National Hurricane Center predicted that Hurricane Dean would impact the Yucatán Peninsula a full 6days {{before the storm}} actually arrived.

On August 17, {{at the request of the}} Quintana Roo state government, which was expecting their state <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> direct hit, the Civil Protection Office of Mexico's federal Interior Ministry declared a state of emergency for the entire state. This included the towns and cities of Cancún, Playa del Carmen, and Chetumal as well as the islands of Cozumel, Isla Mujeres and Holbox.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} their {{declaration of war}} on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914, the British War Cabinet began to consider the future of Palestine. By late 1917, in the lead up to the Balfour Declaration, the wider war had reached a stalemate, with two of Britain's Allies and Associated Powers not fully engaged: the United States had yet <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> casualty, and the Russians were distracted by internal upheaval. A stalemate in southern Palestine was broken by the Battle of Beersheba on 31 October 1917.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, Scotland {{played a}} major role in the British and allied effort in the two world wars and began <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> sharp {{industrial}} decline, going through periods of considerable political instability. The decline was particularly acute in the second half of the 20th century, but was compensated for to a degree by the development of an extensive oil industry, technological manufacturing and a growing service sector. This period also increasing debates about the place of Scotland within the United Kingdom, the rise of the Scottish National Party and after a referendum in 1999 the establishment of a devolved Scottish Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Riefenstahl {{attended}} dancing academies {{and became}} {{well known for}} her self-styled interpretive dancing skills, traveling across Europe with Max Reinhardt in a show funded by Jewish producer Harry Sokal. Riefenstahl often made almost 700 Reichmarks for each performance and was so dedicated to dancing that she gave filmmaking no thought. She began <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> series of foot injuries that led to knee surgery that threatened her dancing career. It was while going to a doctor's appointment that she first saw a poster for the 1924 film Der Berg des Schicksals ("The Mountain of Destiny"). She became inspired to go into movie making, and began visiting the cinema to see films and also attended film shows.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{chapters}} expound on how {{the arrangement}} came to be: the children's stepmother, Parwana, grew up as the less-favored child to her beautiful twin sister Masooma. One day, {{in a flash of}} jealousy, she caused Masooma <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> debilitating injury that resulted in paraplegia. Parwana subsequently spent several years caring for her sister until the latter asked her to help her commit suicide and to then marry Saboor. Their older brother, Nabi, left to work for Mr. Wahdati, a wealthy man in Kabul, and became infatuated with his wife, Nila. After Nila expressed dismay about her inability to have children, Nabi arranged for Pari to be sold to the couple.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Skanderbeg {{had been at}} war with Venice. Realizing the {{magnitude}} of his challenge, Skanderbeg attempted to relieve the garrison by engaging in skirmishes with the Ottoman army. His forces succeeded in inflicting heavy casualties on the Turkish forces through guerrilla-style attacks. Efforts were made by Skanderbeg to use intelligence forces, operating as far as Constantinople, to gather information on Murad's plans of action. Meanwhile, near Scutari, {{he had been able}} to defeat a Venetian force and managed to considerably weaken the Venetian presence in Albania. Despite these efforts, on July 31 the garrison of Svetigrad surrendered due to a disruption in the water supply. The garrison was spared and a force of Ottoman Janissaries was stationed inside the fortress instead. Two years later, Murad would march against Krujë, only <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> heavy defeat.|$|E

5|$|Back in England, Trescothick {{was called}} upon to captain England after Michael Vaughan {{sustained}} a knee injury. Although other England captains had seemed <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> lack of batting form, the extra authority did not affect Trescothick, and he forged a good partnership with debutant Andrew Strauss against New Zealand. This understanding developed in the second Test with a first-wicket partnership of 153; Trescothick went on to score 132, his sixth Test century. Trescothick's partnerships with Strauss were to average 52.35 in 52 innings. His first century against the West Indies followed in the second Test, and Trescothick became {{the first player to}} make centuries in both innings of a Test match at Edgbaston, and the ninth England player to score a century in each innings of a Test match. Trescothick was again England's best One Day International batsman in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, scoring 261 runs in just four innings, including a century in the final; he also took his fourth ODI wicket.|$|E
5|$|Caio Duilios next {{operation}} was a sortie against the British convoy MW 9 bounded from Alexandria to Malta in February. She departed from Taranto on 14 February {{with a pair}} of light cruisers and seven destroyers, but the force could not locate the British ships, and so returned to port. Her mere presence at sea, however, forced the British escort to scuttle the transport Rowallan Castle, previously disabled by German aircraft. On the 21st, she escorted the convoy K7 from Messina and Corfu to Taranto. By this point in 1942, the Italian fleet began <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> severe shortage of fuel, which curtailed its operations. The situation was so bad that Caio Duilio had to be placed in reserve and drained of fuel, {{in order to keep the}} escort craft operational. She was at Taranto when Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943, and on 9 September she was taken to Malta, where she was interned with the rest of the Italian fleet.|$|E
5|$|Connie Smith {{was born}} Constance June Meador on August 14, 1941 to Wilma and Hobart Meador in Elkhart, Indiana. Her parents were {{originally}} from West Virginia, and when Smith was five months old, the family returned there. They would later move to Dungannon, Ohio. Her father was abusive {{when she was}} a child, which would eventually cause her <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> mental breakdown {{when she was a}} teenager. When she was seven, her mother divorced her father and married Tom Clark. Clark brought 8 children to the new marriage; Meador brought five, including Smith. The couple would eventually have two more children together, which in total added up to fifteen children. As a child, Smith was surrounded by music. Her stepfather played mandolin, while her brother played fiddle, and her other brother played guitar. On Saturday nights Smith would listen to the Grand Ole Opry radio broadcast. While she was a teenager, she was injured in a lawnmower accident, which nearly cut her leg off. While in the hospital recovering, she was given a guitar and learned how to play different chords. Following the recovery, she began to perform in various local talent contests. In 1959, Smith graduated from Salem-Liberty High School as the class salutatorian.|$|E

5|$|In modern-day Germany, the Holy Roman Empire {{continued}} to rule, but the elective {{nature of the}} imperial crown meant there was no enduring dynasty around which a strong state could form. Further east, the kingdoms of Poland, Hungary, and Bohemia grew powerful. In Iberia, the Christian kingdoms {{continued to}} gain land from the Muslim kingdoms of the peninsula; Portugal concentrated on expanding overseas during the 15th century, while the other kingdoms were riven by difficulties over royal succession and other concerns. After losing the Hundred Years' War, England went on <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> long civil war known as the Wars of the Roses, which lasted into the 1490s and only ended when Henry Tudor (r. 1485–1509 as Henry VII) became king and consolidated power with his victory over Richard III (r. 1483–85) at Bosworth in 1485. In Scandinavia, Margaret I of Denmark (r. in Denmark 1387–1412) consolidated Norway, Denmark, and Sweden in the Union of Kalmar, which continued until 1523. The major power around the Baltic Sea was the Hanseatic League, a commercial confederation of city states that traded from Western Europe to Russia. Scotland emerged from English domination under Robert the Bruce (r. 1306–29), who secured papal recognition of his kingship in 1328.|$|E
5|$|No.79 Squadron {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Laverton in Victoria on 26April 1943 {{under the command}} of flying ace Squadron Leader Alan Rawlinson. The squadron's {{intended}} role was to use Spitfire Vc fighters to provide 'high cover' escort for the RAAF's P-40 Kittyhawk-equipped units which were engaging Japanese forces in the New Guinea Campaign. This requirement was considered urgent, and the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, directed that No.79 Squadron receive priority for the RAAF's limited stock of Spitfires. The squadron moved to Wooloomanata Aerodrome several days after it was formed, and received its first Spitfires on 3May. While at Wooloomanata No.79 Squadron undertook training exercises to prepare for combat. The allocation of 24 Spitfires to the squadron led to No. 1 Wing RAAF, which was stationed near Darwin and responsible for protecting the town against air attack, <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> shortage of these aircraft during June and July.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, Babe begins blackmailing Les anonymously.

Babe later threatens to reveal photos of Les crossdressing, causing Pam to humiliate herself while {{the stress of the}} blackmail causes Les <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> heart attack. When Babe discovers that Abi and Lee had sex and that Abi has passed on an STI to Lee's pregnant girlfriend, Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Babe badly burns Abi's hand. After the fling is exposed, Abi informs the Carter family about Babe's involvement and the family subsequently disown her. At a low ebb, Babe begins blackmailing the Cokers again, despite the recent death of their grandson, Paul, as well as threatening Abi. Pam eventually confides in Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) about the blackmail and she threatens Babe to stop it.|$|E

5|$|Gaara first {{appears in}} the series when he is sent to Konohagakure, an allied ninja village, {{to take part in}} the Chunin Exams {{alongside}} his older siblings Kankuro and Temari. In truth, he is sent in order to infiltrate Konohagakure in preparation for an invasion by Sunagakure and its ally, Otogakure. There, he and Kankuro and Temari easily pass both the first and second phases. In the third phase, Gaara is set to fight against Rock Lee. Lee is able to pass Gaara's defenses, provoking an enraged Gaara into breaking Lee's arm and leg, claiming victory. Sasuke Uchiha manages to give Gaara the first injury he has ever received, causing Gaara <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> mental breakdown and nearly manifest his Tailed-Beast powers. This begins the invasion, with his older siblings carrying him off as he could not participate in his current state of mind. Both Sasuke and Naruto Uzumaki confront him with the latter defeating him. Later, Sunagakure sends Gaara to help in preventing Sasuke from defecting to Otogakure, which became enemy of Sunagakure once learning that Orochimaru murdered Rasa prior to the attack. While he is able to help Lee fight Orochimaru's servant Kimimaro, Gaara is unable to prevent Sasuke from escaping from Konoha. He makes amends with the many characters he had alienated, apologizing to those he hurt and improving his relationship with his family. At the same time, Gaara's fundamental characteristic becomes the desire to protect as many people as he can, as in doing so he believes, like Naruto, he will be able to find true strength. This culminates in his replacing his father as the Fifth Kazekage during Part II of the series.|$|E
5|$|Lexie takes {{part in a}} {{surgery on}} a patient named Alison Clark (Caroline Williams) and informs her husband Gary Clark (Michael O'Neill) {{that it was a}} success. However, moments later Alison suffers a stroke and falls into a coma that she is deemed {{unlikely}} to wake from. As Alison had signed a DNR form, Lexie is forced to turn off the machine keeping her alive, despite Gary begging her to stop. After failing in an attempt to sue the hospital, a grief-stricken Mr. Clark later returns to the hospital with a gun, seeking revenge on Lexie, Derek and Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.). After witnessing Mr. Clark shoot a nurse dead, Mark shields Lexie during the shooting and the pair attempt to save a critically wounded Alex. Seeking supplies, Lexie heads out into the hospital and comes face to face with Mr Clark who attempts to shoot her, but she is saved by a SWAT team member who wounds Clark at the last moment allowing her to escape. Lexie and Mark proceed to save Alex's life, but Lexie is disappointed and irritated when a delirious Alex calls for his ex-wife, Izzie, while nearly dying instead of Lexie. After a showdown with Richard, Gary Clark eventually commits suicide, having killed eleven people and wounding another seven, as well as causing Meredith <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> miscarriage.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly {{recessed}} on August 28 for the Labor Day holiday, and did {{not come}} back into session until September 4. The same day, Governor Stanley conferred with Rep. Smith, Delegate Gray, and House Speaker Moore. Their discussion focused on the Stanley plan's lack of an appeals process for pupil assignments. Stanley agreed to a compromise that would allow an administrative appeal (through an as-yet-to-be-worked-out process), followed by a required appeal to state courts and lower federal courts before any appeal could {{be taken to the}} U.S. Supreme Court. The Stanley plan seemed <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> serious blow the following day, however, when the Virginia State Board of Education voted not to endorse the plan. Four members strongly opposed withholding state funds from integrated schools, which led to the negative vote. The board also voted to publicly support the original Gray Commission plan. Meeting with the board after the vote, Governor Stanley discussed the possibility of merging his plan with some sort of pupil assignment plan, so that pupil assignment would be permitted but funds would still be withheld if assignment failed to segregate the schools. Another blow to the Stanley plan came when Colgate W. Darden, Jr., the former governor of Virginia who was now president of the University of Virginia, announced he opposed the Stanley plan and supported the Gray Commission's original proposals.|$|E
