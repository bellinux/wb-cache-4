5|$|In {{downtown}} Adrian, {{the highways}} previously split into an uncommon arrangement of one-way streets.

Northbound <b>traffic</b> continued on Main Street, while southbound <b>traffic</b> was routed along Winter Street. At Church Street, westbound Bus.

50|$|The Bulgarian {{government}} sustained {{its strong}} anti-trafficking law enforcement response to human <b>trafficking</b> over the reporting period. Bulgaria prohibits <b>trafficking</b> for both commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor through Section 159 of its criminal code, which prescribes penalties of {{between two and}} 15 years’ imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. In 2009, police conducted 131 new <b>trafficking</b> investigations including nine labor <b>trafficking</b> investigations, compared with 187 sex <b>trafficking</b> and 25 labor <b>trafficking</b> investigations conducted in 2008. In 2009, authorities prosecuted 77 individuals for sex <b>trafficking</b> and four for forced labor compared with 79 persons prosecuted for sex <b>trafficking</b> and eight for labor <b>trafficking</b> in 2008. A total of 83 <b>trafficking</b> offenders were convicted - 80 for sex <b>trafficking</b> and three for labor <b>trafficking</b> offenses - compared with 66 sex <b>trafficking</b> offenders and three labor <b>trafficking</b> offenders convicted in 2008.

5|$|<b>Traffic</b> is {{regularly}} counted {{by means of}} a <b>traffic</b> census at toll stations and reported by Hrvatske autoceste. The reported <b>traffic</b> volume gradually decreases as the motorway chainage increases and as it passes by various major destinations and the interchanges that serve them. Thus the greatest volume of <b>traffic</b> is registered along Zagreb bypass, especially the JankomirLučko section, with 41,549vehicle annual average daily <b>traffic</b> (AADT). The busiest tolled section of the motorway is Ivanja RekaRugvica with 27,049AADT and 34,543vehicle average summer daily <b>traffic</b> (ASDT) figures. The <b>traffic</b> volume gradually decreases from that section eastward to the eastern terminus of the motorway, where the lowest AADT and ASDT figures are recorded.

The seasonal <b>traffic</b> volume variation ranges from a 28% increase on the busiest, Ivanja RekaRugvica, section to a 75% volume increase, as measured on the ŽupanjaSpačva section. Average summer season <b>traffic</b> volume increase on the motorway is 55%. The AADT/ASDT ratio analysis does not include Zagreb bypass, as there are no ASDT data available for the bypass.|$|E

The reported <b>traffic</b> volume gradually decreases as the motorway chainage increases and as it passes by various major destinations and the interchanges that serve them. Thus the greatest volume of <b>traffic</b> is registered between Jastrebarsko and Lučko interchanges – with 31,432 vehicle annual average daily <b>traffic</b> (AADT), and 53,216 vehicle average summer daily <b>traffic</b> (ASDT) figures as that is the section closest to Zagreb. South of the Bosiljevo2 interchange the first major drop of <b>traffic</b> volume is recorded on the A1 motorway, due to <b>traffic</b> transferring to the A6 motorway towards Rijeka. Other similar changes of the <b>traffic</b> volume are registered near Zadar (served by Zadar1 and Zadar2 interchanges) and Split served by Dugopolje interchange. Substantial variations observed between AADT and ASDT are normally attributed {{to the fact that}} the motorway carries significant tourist <b>traffic.</b> The seasonal increase <b>traffic</b> volume variations ranges 69% on the busiest, Lučko–Jastrebarsko section to 160% as measured on Sveti Rok–Maslenica section.
