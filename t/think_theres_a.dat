5000|$|We {{really love}} what were doing. We still love playing music together. I <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> whole {{philosophy}} with our band. When {{you know there}} are a couple thousand people who paid money and just want to have a good night out, and if you think about that for a minute before the show, you get really fired up. Its quite a nice job we have, and a great lifestyle. —Darren MiddletonWhen asked what inspires the band before live performances.|$|E

5000|$|After this, Holst tackled {{his final}} attempt at opera in a cheerful vein, with The Wandering Scholar (1929-30), to a text by Clifford Bax. Imogen {{refers to the}} music as [...] "Holst at his best in a scherzando (playful) frame of mind"; Vaughan Williams commented on the lively, folksy rhythms: [...] "Do you <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> little bit too much 6/8 in the opera?"

5000|$|On February 23, 2007, Del James {{announced}} that the recording stage of Chinese Democracy was finished, and the band had now moved onto mixing the album, mentioning [...] "After some delays and scheduling difficulties, things appear to be moving along." [...] However, this proved that the March 6 release date {{would be impossible to}} achieve, and the album once again had no scheduled release date.In a December 2007 interview, Sebastian Bach claimed Rose had planned to have the album released by Christmas 2007: [...] "I know Axl was very serious about putting something out before Christmas. He was talking to me about it. He was talking about finishing liner notes." [...] Bach also said that Chinese Democracys delay might be because of business problems: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> lot of business shit that goes on with him. Its just not as easy. Its a little more complicated than people think." ...|$|E
5000|$|The lyrical themes on {{the album}} deal with issues of spirituality, morality, and self-examination. Vedder said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> little self-examination in those songs, {{something}} {{that a lot of}} my friends are going through too, as they approach 30." [...] Ament said, [...] "In some ways, its like the bands story. Its about growing up." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Hail, Hail" [...] refer to two people in a troubled relationship struggling to hold it together. Vedder has said that he wrote the song [...] "Off He Goes" [...] about himself and how he is a [...] "shit friend," [...] adding, [...] "Ill show up and everythings great and then all of the sudden Im outta there..." [...] "Lukin" [...] is about the [...] "pretty intense stalker problem," [...] Vedder faced during the mid-1990s.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Country Music Television, Yearwood described how Heaven, Heartache and the Power of Love (compared with her previous efforts) sounded more confident when she recorded the album. Yearwood noted that finding a comfort zone when recording {{was more important than}} simply finding confidence."I <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> comfort level. I used to worry so much about it being pitch-perfect and over-thinking things. As a demo singer, you would go into a studio and youd have a limited amount of time to sing your songs. You were getting paid $40 a song, you did your own harmonies, and you got work because you knew the song when you got there and you worked fast and cheap. And then when you go to make your album, and youve been waiting your entire life to make that first album, you think, [...] "Oh, my gosh. This is an album {{and it has to be}} perfect." [...] As time passes, you learn how to do a better job, just like anything." ...|$|E

Norman Chad, WSOP commentator On {{the first day of}} the tournament, Moon was dealt pocket aces six times and got three-of-a-kind on the flop three times. He performed well on the first day and continued a successful streak throughout the tournament, although he himself proclaimed it was luck. He eliminated several professional poker players during the tournament, including David Benyamine. He eventually obtained the chip lead and kept it until the seventh day of play. At that time, he fell to tenth place, but won a few big hands to recover and ended the day back in the lead.

5000|$|When I {{first came}} up with the lines, I dont know what it is, but you got to do it/ I dont know where to go but you got to be there, I was at this party for The Strokes in New York. There was this {{prevailing}} sense of, Were not quite sure whats happening or what is cool, but we know that its somewhere around here, in this room. It was this vague confusion, with everybody kind of sniffing for blood. It wasnt that it was a bad party, or that I dont like The Strokes; I just <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> lot of confusion right now in the music business. Then, later on, I realized the song was really personal. I didnt know where I was, and I didnt know I was actually lost. It wasnt about the party at all; its about searching but not knowing what youre searching for. Theres the train motif, being on this train heading for either oblivion or salvation - and just holding on for dear life. That song came down from some mountain somewhere, because it was right after I wrote it that I sort of packed it in.|$|E

5000|$|In 2006, Frank and {{incoming}} House Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{were accused}} by Rep. John Hostettler (R-IN) {{of having a}} [...] "radical homosexual agenda"; Frank responded [...] "I do have things I {{would like to see}} adopted on behalf of LGBT people: they include the right to marry the individual of our choice; the right to serve in the military to defend our country; and the right to a job based solely on our own qualifications. I acknowledge that this is an agenda, but I do not think that any self-respecting radical in history would have considered advocating peoples rights to get married, join the army, and earn a living as a terribly inspiring revolutionary platform." [...] Franks stance on outing gay Republicans has been called the [...] "Frank Rule" [...] whereby a closeted person who uses her or his power, position, or notoriety to hurt LGBT people can be outed. The issue became relevant during the Mark Foley scandal of 2006, during which Frank clarified his position on HBOs Real Time with Bill Maher: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> right to privacy. But the right to privacy should not be a right to hypocrisy. And people who want to demonize other people shouldnt then be able to go home and close the door and do it themselves." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Neil Finn, [...] "It (Time on Earth) doesnt {{sound like}} any one {{particular}} Crowded House album, {{but it has}} elements of Crowded House... {{in as much as}} Nick and I make a sound together when we play and always did. I <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make sense of it and move forward. And as such, it seemed the most obvious and {{best way to do that}} was to be playing music again with each other, Nick and I. I want to be in a band and what other band could it be." [...] Crowded Houses leader, Neil Finn has indicated that, as the album began life as a solo project, its sound is generally different from Crowded House, though similar in parts, indicating that no one album by the group sounds like this one. As the album is dedicated to Hester and attends to his death, much of the album has a mournful tone, however this has been received well by critics, with some indicating that [...] "fortunately, Finn is a master at expressing ambiguity, (both) lyrically and musically". Finn has said of the song [...] "People Are Like Suns", that [...] "Part of it is the idea that people burn brightly and then they fade out. Also, when I wrote it, I was reading Ian McEwans novel Saturday, which begins with a man on his balcony watching his plane go down, so the first lines borrow something from that image." ...|$|E
