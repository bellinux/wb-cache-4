50|$|Gryllodes sigillatus, known {{commonly}} as the <b>Tropical</b> <b>house</b> <b>cricket,</b> Indian house cricket, or the banded cricket, {{is a small}} cricket probably {{native to}} Southwestern Asia, but has spread throughout tropical regions worldwide. Like its relative the House cricket, the <b>Tropical</b> <b>house</b> <b>cricket</b> is also raised commercially for feeding certain pets such as reptiles, birds, amphibians, and insectivorous arthropods.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tropical</b> <b>house</b> <b>cricket</b> is a tad bit {{smaller than}} its {{relative}} the house cricket, growing about 13 - 18 mm. These crickets are a light yellowish tan in color, and have two thick, black bands. One {{of the bands}} runs through {{the bottom of the}} thorax, while the other goes across the upper abdomen. Females are similar to males, only wingless and a long ovipositor emerging from its rear.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tropical</b> <b>house</b> <b>crickets</b> are {{relatively}} {{new to the}} pet trade, and are favored by many people, due to easier care requirements than the more-common <b>House</b> <b>cricket</b> or the Black field cricket. The banded crickets {{are said to be}} a lot more active than competitors, and live longer lifespans than the average <b>house</b> <b>cricket.</b> They also have a lower chitin content than average crickets, making digestibility easier. <b>Tropical</b> <b>house</b> <b>crickets</b> are also immune to the CrPV virus. Care is similar to that of the <b>House</b> <b>cricket.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Tropical</b> <b>house</b> <b>crickets</b> {{generally}} cause no harm, {{though the}} singing males {{can be a}} nuisance in households. If nuisances, crickets can be managed similarly with baits sold for cockroach or earwig control.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tropical</b> <b>house</b> is a subgenre of deep house, {{which is}} itself a subgenre of house music. Thus, it {{possesses}} typical house music characteristics, including synthesizer instrumentation, and a 4/4 kick drum pattern. <b>Tropical</b> <b>house</b> differentiates itself from deep house, which can often have a very dark sound, whereas <b>tropical</b> <b>house</b> {{can be described as}} having a more uplifting and relaxing sound.The tempo of <b>tropical</b> <b>house</b> songs is a little slower than deep <b>house</b> (110-115 bpm). <b>Tropical</b> <b>house</b> does not use the pumping compression effect of [...] "big room" [...] electro house. It usually includes tropical instruments such as steel drums, marimba, guitar, saxophone or even pan flute, and can sometimes utilise dembow rhythm patterns often attributed to genres such as dancehall and reggaeton.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid {{and late}} 2000s, Bob Sinclar and Yves Larock created {{international}} hits which had many characteristics of <b>tropical</b> <b>house.</b> In 2012, Unicorn Kid had created tropical rave, a faster {{form of the}} genre which would become known as <b>tropical</b> <b>house.</b> However, {{it was not until}} 2013 with Klangkarussell's [...] "Sun Don't Shine" [...] and the emergence of producers such as Kygo and Robin Schulz that <b>tropical</b> <b>house</b> became a dance music trend. During 2014 and 2015, producers such as Lost Frequencies, Felix Jaehn, Alex Adair, Sam Feldt, Bakermat, Klingande and Faul & Wad Ad would join them with big <b>tropical</b> <b>house</b> hits. <b>Tropical</b> <b>house</b> arrived in 2015 in the globally mass market fully through Justin Bieber's 2015 album Purpose and its first two singles [...] "What Do You Mean?" [...] and [...] "Sorry".|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} <b>house</b> <b>crickets</b> {{as a source}} of food or feed is increasing. Meeting this demand will require {{efficient}} production systems. <b>House</b> <b>crickets</b> are often fed a combination of dry feed and fresh plant material. Supplying fresh plant material could improve growth and development, but also increases labour and costs. Two experiments were conducted to verify that provision of fresh plant materials has a beneficial effect on <b>house</b> <b>cricket</b> performance. In the first experiment, <b>house</b> <b>crickets</b> were provided with an ad libitum supply of chicken feed, a water dispenser, and with carrots at different frequencies: (1) daily; (2) three times a week; (3) first week daily then three times a week; (4) two weeks daily then three times a week; and (5) no carrots. When the first cricket in a container reached adulthood, all crickets in that container were harvested. Survival, development time and body weight were determined. In a second experiment feed conversion efficiency of <b>house</b> <b>crickets,</b> either provided with carrots daily or not at all, was compared. No effects of carrot provision on survival, development time, body weight or feed conversion efficiency were found. The outcomes of these parameters were similar to other studies in which crickets were provided with chicken feed. The results indicate that supplying carrots in addition to a suitable dry feed and water does not improve <b>house</b> <b>cricket</b> survival, development time, body weight and feed conversion efficiency. </p...|$|R

The first used semipurified diets to identify limiting amino acids. There {{were no significant differences}} in weight gain of chicks fed diets with amino acid additions, but feed:gain ratios indicated that arginine, methionine, and tryptophan were probably limiting. In the second experiment, dried <b>house</b> <b>cricket</b> meal was incorporated into practical diets replacing soybean meal as the major source of protein. There {{were no significant differences in}} weight gain between chicks fed corn-soybean meal diet and those fed corn-cricket diets. Feed:gain ratios improved significantly when diets were supplemented with methionine and arginine.
