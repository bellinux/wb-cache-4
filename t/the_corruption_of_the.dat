5|$|Though the {{pamphlet}} describes the pitiable and desperate {{conditions in which}} prostitutes lived, and <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> police supposed to be patrol them, it also accuses prostitutes of 'Inhumanity' and deems them devilish and monstrous. The vices of the prostitute are presented as those endemic among all women.|$|E
5|$|Although {{his suicide}} is often {{linked to the}} Foundation’s {{financial}} difficulties, the letter clearly shows Favaloro overwhelmed by <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> health system and feeling {{that he could not}} fight against this powerful organization. In some parts of the letter, he refers to himself as “Don Quijote” in his lonely battle against the giants. Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had resolved to marry one of his longtime colleagues and coauthors, Diana Truden; she lived with Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when he committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|His {{influence}} can {{as well be}} seen in Ecuadorian {{thought in}} general, as his work {{has been one of}} its principal influences; Ecuadorian education, as he promoted new pedagogical ideas, such as the creation of good citizens instead of merely imparting knowledge, and finally Ecuadorian science, as he was, along with Pedro Vicente Maldonado, one of the two most important scientists of colonial Ecuador. Espejo analyzed the reality of colonial Quito, the poverty of its people and their lack of good education, and he denounced <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonial authorities.|$|E
50|$|Although Jacob was an {{orthodox}} Roman Catholic, {{he is said}} to have been called to account by the priests for translating the Bible into the vulgar tongue. In spite of his orthodoxy, Jacob was a keen satirist <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corruptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clergy. He was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most learned men of his age, and for two centuries was <b>the</b> most celebrated <b>of</b> Flemish poets.|$|R

5|$|Orr's first {{professional}} contract {{was one of}} the first in professional ice hockey to be negotiated by an agent. It made him the highest-paid player in NHL history as a rookie. His second contract was the first million-dollar contract in the NHL. However, after his retirement, Orr learned he was deeply in debt and he had to sell off most of what he owned. Orr broke with his agent Alan Eagleson and sued the Black Hawks to settle his contract. Orr and his family returned to Boston where Orr went into business to rebuild his finances. Orr aided the investigations that led to Eagleson's fraud convictions and disbarment. Orr also supported the lawsuit that exposed <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NHL's pension plan.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Brundage {{began work}} as a {{construction}} superintendent for the leading architectural firm of Holabird & Roche. In the three years {{he worked for the}} firm, he supervised the construction of $7.5million in buildings—3percent of the total built in Chicago in that time-frame. He disliked <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chicago building trades. Brundage's biographer, Allen Guttmann, points out that the young engineer {{was in a position to}} benefit from influence if he had wanted to, as his uncle, Edward J. Brundage, was by then Republican leader of Chicago's North Side and would become Attorney General of Illinois. Brundage had been successful in a number of track and field events while at Illinois. In 1910, as a member of the Chicago Athletic Association (CAA), he finished third in the national all-around championships (an American predecessor of the decathlon), sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and continued training, aiming at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting a new revolutionary {{era in the}} European history {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution, the authors expressed sharp social criticism, castigating <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church authorities, the idleness of the monasticism, and popular superstition. They also appealed for reform of the language, education, and change to the social mores as a way to overcome backwardness and to renew people's mentality with a more western view. They claimed that Greece is positioned within a Europe defined by the dynamics of political reforms from old and corrupt monarchical regimes to new republican communities. The modern innovative spirit of Geographia Neoteriki was also expressed in the use of a lively and malleable vernacular (Demotic) language with very few ties to the katharevousa, a more archaich form of Greek, which was commonly used by most Greek scholars of that time.|$|E

5|$|The Democratic nominee was Samuel J. Tilden, the Governor of New York. Tilden was {{considered}} a formidable adversary who, like Hayes, {{had a reputation for}} honesty. Also like Hayes, Tilden was a hard-money man and supported civil service reform. In accordance with the custom of the time, the campaign was conducted by surrogates, with Hayes and Tilden remaining in their respective home towns. The poor economic conditions made the party in power unpopular and made Hayes suspect that he might lose the election. Both candidates focused their attention on the swing states of New York and Indiana, as well as the three southern states—Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida—where Reconstruction governments still barely ruled, amid recurring political violence. The Republicans emphasized the danger of letting Democrats run the nation so soon after southern Democrats provoked the Civil War and, to a lesser extent, the danger a Democratic administration would pose to the recently won civil rights of southern blacks. Democrats, for their part, trumpeted Tilden's record of reform and contrasted it with <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incumbent Grant administration.|$|E
5|$|With his assistance, DedSec {{manages to}} expose <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FBI and {{numerous}} Silicon Valley corporations through the hacking of their data facilities. Learning that Blume {{is planning to}} install a satellite network designed to bypass undersea data cables, which would effectively give Blume a monopoly on the entire world's electronic data and stock exchanges, they infiltrate the launch area {{of one of the}} satellites to install a backdoor. In order to bring down Blume and Dušan for good, Marcus breaks into all of Blume's international headquarters and lastly their San Francisco headquarters and hacks their servers, exposing the existence of Bellwether and Dušan's corruption. Dušan is arrested for fraud and Blume is put under investigation, though DedSec resolve to continue their fight against Blume. In an extended ending scene added in a post-release patch, two unidentified individuals note that more DedSec cells and hacktivist groups have been emerging worldwide in response to the San Francisco Blume scandal, and {{that it is time to}} put their own plans into motion.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{high command}} and {{ineffectiveness}} of military strength was soon revealed once the Song made {{a joint effort}} with the Jurchen people to conquer the Khitan Liao dynasty (916–1125). After the successful rebellion of the Jurchens against their Khitan masters, the Jurchen observed {{the weakness of the}} Song army and broke their pact, then attacked the Song as well. By 1127, the capital at Kaifeng was captured and northern China overrun, while the remnants of the Song court fled south to Hangzhou and established the Southern Song. This was a crucial blow to the Song military elites, as they had been closely tied to the political structure until 1127; afterwards they became alienated from the emperor and the Song court. Although they had lost northern China to the new Jurchen Jin dynasty (1115–1234), this loss prompted the Song to make drastic and lasting military reforms. Emperor Gaozong, desperate to refill the decimated ranks of the central army, drafted men from all over the country. This had been done before, but not on the same scale. Only the most skilled soldiers became imperial guardsmen, while under Gaozong entire central army units were composed of soldiers from every region and background. The Southern Song eventually recovered their strength and commanded the loyalty of vaunted commanders such as Yue Fei (1103–1142), who successfully defended the border at the Huai River. The Jurchens and Song eventually signed a peace treaty in 1141.|$|E

50|$|David Simple was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{earliest}} sentimental novels, {{featuring a}} wayfaring hero {{in search of}} true friendship who triumphs by good nature and moral strength. He finds happiness in marriage and a rural, bucolic life, away from <b>the</b> <b>corruptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. David Simple is an analog, in a sense, to <b>the</b> figure <b>of</b> Heartsfree, in Henry Fielding's Jonathan Wild and Squire Allworthy in his Tom Jones. However, he also shares characteristics with other sentimental figures who find their peace only with escape from <b>corruption</b> and <b>the</b> harmony <b>of</b> a new Utopia. In her Volume the Last, however, Fielding's fiction, like Henry Fielding's, is darker and shows less of a faith in <b>the</b> triumph <b>of</b> goodness in <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> a corrosive, immoral world.|$|R

25|$|The {{principal}} {{themes of}} sex and death were considered scandalous.

Notable in some poems is Baudelaire's use of imagery {{of the sense of}} smell and of fragrances, which is used to evoke feelings of nostalgia and past intimacy.|$|E
25|$|The {{period was}} also infamous for papal corruption, with many Popes fathering children, and {{engaging}} in nepotism and simony. <b>The</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led, in part, to the Reformation and, in turn, the Counter-Reformation. Alexander VI, for example, was well known for his decadence, extravagance and immoral life. Under extravagant and rich popes, Rome {{was transformed into a}} centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.|$|E

Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that a third of the Russian medals won at Sochi were the result of doping.|$|E

50|$|Hobart also {{opposed the}} American Bible Society, perhaps {{part of his}} strong {{opposition}} to dissenting churches. In 1816 he published a pamphlet to dissuade Episcopalians from joining the new movement, which he thought the Protestant Episcopal Church had not the numerical or the financial strength to control. Instead, in 1818, to counterbalance the Bible Society's influence and especially of Scott's Commentaries, Hobart began to edit <b>the</b> Family Bible <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. He also delivered episcopal charges to <b>the</b> clergy <b>of</b> Connecticut and New York entitled The Churchman (1819) and The High Churchman Vindicated (1826), in which Hobart accepted the label high churchman, explaining his principles to distinguish them from <b>the</b> <b>corruptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church <b>of</b> Rome and from <b>the</b> Errors <b>of</b> Certain Protestant Sects.|$|R

25|$|He {{viewed the}} royal court of his {{predecessors}} as inefficient, corrupt, and expensive. Thousands of servants, eunuchs, and superfluous officials were therefore summarily dismissed.

Several high-ranking officials under Constantius including the chamberlain Eusebius were found guilty and executed.

25|$|John Milton's Paradise Lost (1667) {{opens with}} the fallen angels, {{including}} their leader Satan, {{waking up in}} Hell after having been defeated {{in the war in}} heaven and the action returns there at several points throughout the poem. Milton portrays Hell as the abode of the demons, and the passive prison from which they plot their revenge upon Heaven through <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human race. 19th-century French poet Arthur Rimbaud alluded to the concept as well in the title and themes of one of his major works, A Season In Hell.

25|$|Professor Cheyne {{put forth}} a {{surprising}} theory concerning the Jerahmeelites. In his view they were a powerful north-Arabian tribe, with which the Hebrews came into conflict on their first approach to the land. A part of the Jerahmeelites was absorbed by the Hebrews, but there were many contests between the Israelites and {{the main body of}} the Jerahmeelites all through the period of the Kings. Even among the post-exilic opponents of Nehemiah, the Jerahmeelites appear again. Cheyne believes that echoes of these conflicts once reverberated throughout the Old Testament, but that, owing to <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Masoretic text, they must now be reawakened by conjectural emendation of the text.|$|E
