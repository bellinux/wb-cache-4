5|$|Mourning doves can be {{afflicted with}} several {{different}} parasites and diseases, including tapeworms, nematodes, mites, and lice. The mouth-dwelling parasite Trichomonas gallinae is particularly severe. While a mourning dove will sometimes host it without symptoms, it will often cause yellowish {{growth in the}} mouth and esophagus <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> starve the host to death. Avian pox is a common, insect-vectored disease.|$|E
5|$|Testing is the preview branch <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> {{become the}} next major release.

5|$|Following a {{supernova}} explosion, the {{remnant of the}} donor star (IK Pegasus A) would continue with the final velocity it possessed {{when it was a}} member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100–200km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion will create a remnant of expanding material <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 69 (I-69) {{is a part}} of the Interstate Highway System <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> {{run from}} the Mexican border in Texas to the Canadian border at Port Huron, Michigan. In Michigan, it is a state {{trunkline}} highway that enters the state south of Coldwater and passes the cities of Lansing and Flint in the Lower Peninsula. A north–south freeway from the Indiana–Michigan border to the Lansing area, it changes direction to east–west after running concurrently with I-96. The freeway continues to Port Huron before terminating in the middle of the twin-span Blue Water Bridge while running concurrently with I-94 at the border. There are four related business loops for I-69 in the state, connecting the freeway to adjacent cities.|$|E
5|$|The Puppet Master {{explains}} to Kusanagi {{that he was}} created by Section 6. While wandering various networks, he became sentient and began to contemplate his existence. Deciding the essence of humanity is reproduction and mortality, he wants to exist within a physical brain <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> die. As he could not escape Section 6's network, he had to download himself into a cybernetic body. Having interacted with Kusanagi (without her knowledge), he believes she is also questioning her humanity, {{and they have a}} lot in common. He proposes merging their ghosts, in return, Kusanagi would gain all of his capabilities. Kusanagi agrees to the merge.|$|E

5|$|The {{repertoire}} of behaviour involves synchronised performances of various actions such as preening, pointing, calling, bill clacking, staring, and combinations of such behaviours (like the sky-call). When a bird first {{returns to the}} colony it will dance with many partners, but {{after a number of}} years the number of birds an individual will interact with drops, until one partner is chosen and a pair is formed. They then continue to perfect an individual language <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> be unique to that one pair. Having established a pair bond that will last for life, however, most of that dance will never be used again.|$|E
5|$|Tirano Banderas is a 1926 {{novel by}} Spanish writer Ramon Maria del Valle-Inclan (aka Valle-Inclan or Valle). Although was {{published}} in Madrid (Spain), this novel is influenced by Facundo by Ramon Sarmiento {{and it is the}} first of dictator novels. It recounts the fall of the South American dictator Santos Banderas, which directs the fictitious region of Santa Fe de Tierra Firme of despotic mode and cruel to staying in power through terror and oppression. The work describes the behavior of the tyrant and the beginning of a revolutionary movement <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> overthrow him before his clumsiness.|$|E
5|$|After Spike recovers {{and has a}} final {{talk with}} Rashid, he and Elektra are {{captured}} by Cherious Medical, who want to suppress all knowledge of the nanomachines' existence. The two escape from Cherious Medical, grabbing the newly produced vaccine on the way. In turn, Faye escapes after Vincent goes to trigger {{an attack on the}} city <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> kill everyone on Mars. After the group reunites, it is determined that Vincent will spread the nanomachines by exploding the giant jack-o'-lantern balloons used in the Halloween parade: Jet has a troop of old aircraft spread the antibodies over the city while Faye heads for the weather control center and causes it to rain on the city, aiding the spread of the vaccine. Spike and Elektra separately head to confront Vincent. Spike arrives first and the two battle to a standstill, then the nanomachines are released and Spike is temporarily weakened by them. As Vincent prepares to kill him, Elektra arrives and shoots Vincent. Having wanted to die since Titan, Vincent does not defend himself and thanks Elektra for their time together before dying.|$|E

The length of life will depend on many factors.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} neural tube {{transformation}} into structures <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> develop {{into the central}} nervous system is known as neurulation, the success of which is dependent on the presence of folate within the body. This process begins in the human approximately 21 days after conception, and is completed by 28 days. Thus, a woman may not even be aware of her pregnancy by the time the process of neurulation is complete, potentially causing severe consequences {{in the development of the}} fetus.|$|E
25|$|While we {{know about}} the types of {{cytokine}} patterns helper T cells tend to produce, we understand less about how the patterns themselves are decided. Various evidence suggests that the type of APC presenting the antigen to the T cell has a major influence on its profile. Other evidence suggests that the concentration of antigen presented to the T cell during primary activation influences its choice. The presence of some cytokines (such as the ones mentioned above) will also influence the response <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> be generated, but our understanding is nowhere near complete.|$|E
25|$|An {{asymmetrical}} cell division occurs in protodermal cells resulting in one large cell that is fated {{to become a}} pavement cell and a smaller cell called a meristemoid <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> differentiate into the guard cells that surround a stoma. This meristemoid then divides asymmetrically one to three times before differentiating into a guard mother cell. The guard mother cell then makes one symmetrical division, which forms a pair of guard cells. Cell division is inhibited in some cells so there is always at least one cell between stomata.|$|E
