5000|$|The Republic's {{government}} {{was based on}} that of the more famous namesake Roman Republic; a <b>Senate.</b> <b>The</b> government <b>was</b> run by the senators, each one representing a different political party. <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>was</b> basically a Parliament. The main purpose of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>was</b> to provide a chamber of [...] "second thought" [...] to consider legislation passed by a lower house, whose members are usually elected.|$|R

5|$|To {{serve in}} the Maryland Senate, a person must be a citizen of Maryland 25 {{years of age or}} older. Elections for the 47 Senate seats are held every four years {{coincident}} with the federal election in which the President of the United States is not elected. Vacancies are filled through appointment by the Governor. The Senate meets for three months every year; {{the rest of the year}} the work of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>is</b> light and most members hold another job during this time. It has been controlled by Democrats for a number of years. In the 2006 election, more than two-thirds of the Senate seats were won by Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Although {{having the}} same floor plan, the House and Senate {{chambers}} are decorated very differently, with the former in terra cotta and teal colors and the latter in blue and gold. An oval cartouche in the carpet {{at the entrance to}} the House chamber features the state flower, the apple blossom. Presiding over the house is the speaker, whose chair is behind a desk in the center with a plaster and paint version of the state coat of arms. The Senate chamber is somewhat smaller than the House. The president of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>is</b> the lieutenant governor, who presides over sessions from a walnut rostrum at the front of the chamber. Both the House and the Senate use computerized voting systems, including wall-mounted screens that allow visitors to follow the voting and both also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through etched glass panels to better light the room. These ceiling tiles feature the coats-of-arms of each state in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Committees are {{designed}} to assist the Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings, but can also be presented when <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>is</b> not in session. Committees can gather evidence and will often hold public hearings to assist this process. To gather their evidence committees can (with exceptions) travel {{from place to place}} to hear evidence. Committees are able to order the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly). Most evidence taken by committees (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) is published, however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially (in camera), and regularly do so. Committees hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of New South Wales parliamentary committees).|$|E

An interim government {{was put in place}} following the rebellion, and the remaining Senators were not recognised during that time. <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>was</b> re-established and elections were held on 21 April 2006.

5|$|Many {{rules and}} {{procedures}} in the Maryland Senate are set by the state constitution. Beyond the constitutional mandates, rules in the Senate are developed by the Rules Committee.

The Senate meets in the Senate Chamber of the Maryland State House, which has both gallery seating and a door open to the State House lobby, the latter being mandated by the state constitution.

Terms specifying costs of the facilities and materials used by the Justice Department are listed.|$|E
5|$|University {{governance}} {{is conducted}} through the Board of Governors and the Senate, {{both of which}} were given much of their present power in the Unofficial Consolidation of an Act for the Regulation and Support of Dalhousie College in Chapter 24 of the Acts of 1863.

50|$|His many {{titles and}} honors from <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>were</b> {{ultimately}} merely that: honorary. Caesar continually strove for {{more power to}} govern, with as little dependence as possible on honorary titles or <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> <b>The</b> placating and ennobling of Caesar did not allay ultimate confrontation, as <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>was</b> still <b>the</b> authority granting Caesar his titles. Formal power resided in them, resulting in tension with Caesar.|$|R
25|$|The Senate {{represents}} territorial institutions.
