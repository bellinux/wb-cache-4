These DNA-binding proteins act alone or in pairs to confer hormonal responsiveness to Cga, Lhb, Fshb, and Gnrhr. Herein we suggest that the transcriptional response of Jun requires a functional interaction between the T-cell factor (TCF) /lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) family of DNA-binding proteins and β-catenin (officially CTNNB 1), a coactivator of TCF/LEF. Supporting data include demonstration that GnRH increases activity of <b>TOPflash,</b> a TCF/LEF-dependent luciferase reporter, in LβT 2 cells, a gonadotrope-derived cell line. Additional cotransfection experiments indicate that a dominant-negative form of TCF 7 L 2 (TCFDN) that binds DNA, but not β-catenin, blocks GnRH induction of <b>TOPflash.</b> Overexpression of AXIN, an inhibitor of β-catenin, also reduces GnRH stimulation of <b>TOPflash.</b> Transduction of LβT 2 cells with TCFDN adenoviruses diminishes GnRH stimulation of Jun mRNA without altering expression of Egr 1 and Atf 3, two other immediate early genes that confer GnRH responsiveness. Reduction of β-catenin in LβT 2 cells, through stable expression of short hairpin RNA, also selectively compromises GnRH regulation of Jun expression and levels of JUN protein. Finally, overexpression of TCFDN attenuates GnRH regulation of Cga promoter activity, a known downstream target of JUN. Together, these results indicate that GnRH regulation of Jun transcription requires a functional interaction between TCF/LEF and β-catenin and that alteration of either impacts expression of JUN downstream targets such as Cga...|$|E

The expression level of Wnt target genes was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and/or Western blot analysis. Cell growth and cell invasion were assessed by MTS and matrigel assays, respectively. Among 10 FZD gene family members, FZD 7 mRNA was predominantly expressed in six colon cancer cell lines with APC or CTNNB 1 mutation. These six cell lines were transfected with FZD 7 cDNA together with a <b>TOPflash</b> reporter plasmid, resulting in a 1. 5 - to 24. 3 -fold increase of Tcf transcriptional activity. The mRNA expression levels of seven known Wnt target genes were also increased by 1. 5 - to 3. 4 -fold after transfection of FZD 7 cDNA into HCT- 116 cells.

Effects of hypoxia/HIF- 1 a on osteoblast proliferation and related mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, osteoblast growth under hypoxia was examined. We observed that osteoblast growth was inhibited under hypoxia. To explore possible mechanisms for hypoxia/HIF- 1 a to inhibit osteoblast proliferation, we tested the effect of hypoxia/HIF- 1 a on Wnt pathway. Quantitative RT-PCR results revealed that Wnt target genes such as cyclin D 1 and c-Myc were downregulated under hypoxia while HIF- 1 a was upregulated. Treatment of desferrioxamine, a HIF- 1 a activator, led to further downregulation of expressions of cyclin D 1 and c-Myc in osteoblasts. On the contrary, the inhibition of HIF- 1 a by siRNA in osteoblasts led to the expression increase of cyclin D 1 and c-Myc. These data suggest that HIF- 1 a inhibits Wnt pathway in osteoblasts. To examine the effect of HIF- 1 a on Wnt pathway, HIF- 1 a was cotransfected with b-catenin along with <b>Topflash</b> reporter in transient transfection assay. Our results showed that HIF- 1 a inhibited b-catenin-induced <b>Topflash</b> reporter activity.

40|$|Background LRRK 2 {{mutations}} {{and risk}} variants increase susceptibility to inherited and idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, while {{recent studies have}} identified potential protective variants. This, {{and the fact that}} LRRK 2 mutation carriers develop symptoms and brain pathology almost indistinguishable from idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, has led to enormous interest in this protein. LRRK 2 has been implicated in a range of cellular events, but key among them is canonical Wnt signalling, which results in increased levels of transcriptionally active β-catenin. This pathway is critical for the development and survival of the midbrain dopaminergic neurones typically lost in Parkinson’s disease. Methods Here we use Lrrk 2 knockout mice and fibroblasts to investigate the effect of loss of Lrrk 2 on canonical Wnt signalling in vitro and in vivo. Micro-computed tomography was used to study predicted tibial strength, while pulldown assays were employed to measure brain β-catenin levels. A combination of luciferase assays, immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to measure canonical Wnt activity and investigate the relationship between LRRK 2 and β-catenin. <b>TOPflash</b> assays are also used to study the effects of LRRK 2 kinase inhibition and pathogenic and protective LRRK 2 mutations on Wnt signalling. Data were tested by Analysis of Variance. Results Loss of Lrrk 2 causes a dose-dependent increase in the levels of transcriptionally active β-catenin in the brain, and alters tibial bone architecture, decreasing the predicted risk of fracture. Lrrk 2 knockout cells display increased <b>TOPflash</b> and Axin 2 promoter activities, both basally and following Wnt activation. Consistently, over-expressed LRRK 2 was found to bind β-catenin and repress <b>TOPflash</b> activation. Some pathogenic LRRK 2 mutations and risk variants further suppressed <b>TOPflash,</b> whereas the protective R 1398 H variant increased Wnt signalling activity. LRRK 2 kinase inhibitors affected canonical Wnt signalling differently due to off-targeting; however, specific LRRK 2 inhibition reduced canonical Wnt signalling similarly to pathogenic mutations. Conclusions Loss of LRRK 2 causes increased canonical Wnt activity in vitro and in vivo. In agreement, over-expressed LRRK 2 binds and represses β-catenin, suggesting LRRK 2 may act as part of the β-catenin destruction complex. Since some pathogenic LRRK 2 mutations enhance this effect while the protective R 1398 H variant relieves it, our data strengthen the notion that decreased canonical Wnt activity is central to Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis...|$|E

High Ca 2 + stimulated the upregulation (as assessed by RT-PCR) and the secretion of Wnt 5 a (assessed by Western blot), a non-canonical Wnt family member. Inhibiting CaSR activity with siRNA duplex against the CaSR reduced CaSR protein and prevented the secretion of Wnt 5 a. Dominant negative CaSR (R 185 Q) or siRNA, blocked the high Ca 2 +-mediated inhibition of the -catenin reporter <b>TOPFLASH.</b> The CaSR/Wnt 5 a inhibition of -catenin reporter was prevented by dominant negative Ubiquitin ligase Siah 2. In low calcium medium, overexpressing Wnt 5 a increased Siah 2 amplicons and protein. Inducing the expression of full length APC prevented CaSR-mediated increases of Siah 2 and Wnt 5 a.

40|$|Period 2 -mutant mice (Per 2 m/m), which {{possess a}} {{circadian}} dysfunction, recapitulate the retinal vascular phenotype similar to diabetic retinopathy (DR). The vascular dysfunction in Per 2 m/m {{is associated with}} an increase in connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN 2). At the molecular level, CTGF gene expression is dependent on the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The nuclear binding of β-catenin to a transcription factor, lymphoid enhancer binding protein (Lef) / T-cell factor (TCF/LEF), leads to downstream activation of CTGF. For this study, we hypothesized that the silencing of Per 2 results in nuclear translocation and subsequent transactivation of the CTGF gene. To test this hypothesis, we performed immunofluorescence labeling for CTGF in retinal sections from wild-type (WT) and Per 2 m/m mice. Human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were transfected with siRNA for Per 2, and the protein expression of CTGF and β-catenin was evaluated. The TCF/LEF luciferase reporter (<b>TOPflash)</b> assay was performed to validate the involvement of β-catenin in the activation of CTGF. Per 2 m/m retinas exhibited an increased CTGF immunostaining in ganglion cell layer and retinal endothelium. Silencing of Per 2 using siRNA resulted in an upregulation of CTGF and β-catenin. The <b>TOPflash</b> assay revealed an increase in luminescence for HRECs transfected with Per 2 siRNA. Our studies show that loss of Per 2 results in an activation of CTGF via nuclear entry of β-catenin.

In this study, we {{for the first time}} explored crosstalk between PODX and b-cat signaling in GBM cells, and assessed its impact on GBM cell invasion and proliferation. Stable overexpression of PODX in LN- 229 and U- 118 MG human GBM cells increased the soluble/intracellular b-cat level, <b>TOPflash</b> luciferase reporter activity, the mRNA levels of b-cat signaling target genes, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP 9) expression/activity, and cell invasion and proliferation, which was abolished by selective p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor PD 169316 and selective b-cat signaling inhibitor CCT 031374. On the other hand, stable knockdown of PODX in LN- 229 and U- 118 MG cells decreased the soluble b-cat level, <b>TOPflash</b> luciferase reporter activity, the mRNA levels of b-cat signaling target genes, MMP 9 expression/activity, and cell invasion and proliferation, which was completely reversed by overexpression of a constitutively active b-cat mutant. In addition, overexpression of PODX induced p 38 MAPK activity and inactivating phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase- 3 b (GSK- 3 b) at serine 389 in LN- 229 and U- 118 MG cells, which was abolished by PD 169316, but not CCT 031374; knockdown of PODX decreased p 38 MAPK activity and inactivating phosphorylation of GSK- 3 b at serine 389 in both cell lines, which was not significantly affected by overexpression of constitutively active b-cat.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Wnt/β-catenin {{signaling}} activation {{has been}} reported only during the late steps of Barrett’s esophagus (BE) neoplastic progression, but not in BE metaplasia, based on the absence of nuclear β-catenin. However, β-catenin transcriptional activity has been recorded in absence of robust nuclear accumulation. Thus, we aimed to investigate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in nondysplastic BE. METHODS: Esophageal tissues from healthy and BE patients without dysplasia were analyzed for Wnt target gene expression by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Esophageal squamous (EPC 1 -& EPC 2 -hTERT), BE metaplastic (CP-A), and adenocarcinoma (OE 33) cell lines were characterized for Wnt activation by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and luciferase assay. Wnt activity regulation was examined by using recombinant Wnt 3 a and Dickkopf- 1 (Dkk 1) as well as Dkk 1 short interfering RNA. RESULTS: Wnt target genes (AXIN 2, c-MYC, Cyclin D 1, Dkk 1) and Wnt 3 a were significantly upregulated in nondysplastic BE compared with squamous mucosa. Elevated levels of dephosphorylated β-catenin were detected in nondysplastic BE. Nuclear active β-catenin and <b>TOPflash</b> activity were increased in CP-A and OE 33 cells compared with squamous cells. Wnt 3 a-mediated β-catenin signaling activation was abolished by Dkk 1 in CP-A cells. <b>TOPFlash</b> activity was elevated following Dkk 1 silencing in CP-A but not in OE 33 cells. Dysplastic and esophageal adenocarcinoma tissues demonstrated further Dkk 1 and AXIN 2 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the absence of robust nuclear accumulation, β-catenin is transcriptionally active in nondysplastic BE. Dkk 1 overexpression regulates β-catenin signaling in BE metaplastic but not in adenocarcinoma cells, suggesting that early perturbation of Dkk 1 -mediated signaling suppression may contribute to BE malignant transformation...|$|E

Aberrant activation of Wnt/&# 946;-catenin signaling promotes {{the development of}} several cancers and is an attractive target for chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents. Results In order to identify the novel antagonists for the Wnt/&# 946;-catenin pathway, we employed a cell-based Wnt reporter system (<b>TOPflash)</b> to screen a library of 960 known drugs. We identified spiperone, a psychotropic drug, as a novel Wnt inhibitor, which specifically blocks canonical Wnt signaling prior to the activation of &# 946;-catenin. The Wnt inhibitory function of spiperone is not associated with its dopamine-, serotonin- and sigma-receptor antagonist properties. Instead, spiperone increases intracellular calcium levels {{in a similar manner}} to thapsigargin, that also impedes Wnt signal transduction.

However, its molecular mechanism underlying gastric cancer remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether CRNDE {{was involved in the}} development of colorectal cancer via the binding of microRNA (miR) - 217 with transcription factor 7 -like 2 (TCF 7 L 2) to enhance the Wnt signaling pathway. Methods: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect CRNDE, miR- 217 and TCF 7 L 2 in colorectal cancer tissues and cells. The CCK- 8 assay, wound healing assay, and Transwell assay were used to detect cell proliferation, migration and invasion, respectively. Western blotting and luciferase activity assays were used to identify CRNDE and TCF 7 L 2 as one of the direct targets of miR- 217. The activity of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was analyzed by the <b>TOPflash</b> assay, and the subcellular localization of β-catenin and TCF 7 L 2 was analyzed by western blotting and confocal microscopy. Results: In this study, we found that high expression of CRNDE is negatively correlated with low expression of miR- 217 in colorectal cancer tissue and colorectal cancer cells. The dual luciferase reporter analysis showed that miR- 217 is bound to CRNDE and TCF 7 L 2 and negatively regulate their expression. CRNDE down-regulation inhibited the cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo and the inhibitions were both completely blocked after miR- 217 inhibition or TCF 7 L 2 overexpression. Finally, <b>TOPflash</b> analysis showed that the activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is inhibited by CRNDE down-regulation and rescued by TCF 7 L 2 over-expression. Consistently immunostaining and western blotting analysis showed that the expression of b-catenin and TCF 7 L 2 in the nucleus was significantly decreased by CRNDE down-regulation and was rescued by TCF 7 L 2 over-expression. Conclusions: The present study suggest that CRNDE involves in the cell proliferation, migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells via increasing the expression of TCF 7 L 2 and activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling through binding miR- 217 competitively...|$|E

40|$|Glioblastoma is {{the most}} {{malignant}} form of brain cancer. Due to its aggressive nature, extensive research has been performed, but little {{progress has been made}} in identifying effective treatment options. Glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK- 3) is a ubiquitous, multifaceted protein kinase. Previous studies have shown that small molecule inhibitors of GSK- 3 block the migration of glioblastoma cells and may prevent spread of tumor in the brain. However, these studies were performed using non-selective GSK- 3 inhibitors (LiCl and an indirubin derivative, BIO); thus, it was unclear whether GSK- 3 was the most important target. In this study, we used recently generated highly selective GSK- 3 inhibitors (CHIR 99021, AZD 1080, and AZD 2858, as well as BIO) to investigate these questions. These were applied to four glioblastoma cell lines: G 30, G 9, U 251, and U 1242, in three migration assays: transwell, spheroid, and wound healing (scratch) assay to further assess the suitability of GSK- 3 as a target in glioblastoma. We also utilized the ATP Luciferase reporter assay for cell viability to assess the influence of our panel of drugs on cell migration versus viability. In addition, the <b>TOPFlash</b> Luciferase reporter assay was performed as an indicator of the level of GSK- 3 inhibition. 	The <b>TOPFlash</b> assay showed that all GSK- 3 inhibitors were able to increase luciferase levels. This indicates that GSK- 3 was inhibited in our cells after drug treatment. The transwell assays showed us that the GSK- 3 inhibitors were able to block migration significantly in all cell lines tested in a dose-dependent manner. The effectiveness of GSK- 3 inhibition in the three-dimensional collagen spheroid assays was cell line-dependent, with the non-selective GSK- 3 inhibitor BIO showing the most potent effects. Cell migration was not blocked by any of the three selective GSK- 3 inhibitors in the wound healing scratch assay. Thus we have found that the three distinct highly selective inhibitors of GSK- 3 block glioblastoma cell migration, but only work consistently in the transwell assay. Therefore, we conclude that GSK- 3 might be important in the contraction and morphological changes necessary for glioblastoma cells to migrate through the 8 micron pores in the transwell. Further investigation into this observation is necessary. Though results were variable between assays, we conclude that the inhibition of GSK- 3 is a promising potential therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma treatment...|$|E

Surprisingly, we found that miR- 142 inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which was inconsistent with a recent study showing that miR- 142 - 3 p targeted Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) to upregulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Due to the discordance, we elaborated experiments by using extensive mutagenesis, which demonstrated that the stem-loop structure was important for miR- 142 to efficiently suppress Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of miR- 142 relies on miR- 142 - 3 p rather than miR- 142 - 5 p. Further, we found that miR- 142 - 3 p directly modulated translation of Ctnnb 1 mRNA (encoding β-catenin) through binding to its 3 ' untranslated region (3 ' UTR). Finally, miR- 142 was able to repress cell cycle progression by inhibiting active Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Evidence suggests that the androgen receptor (AR) can repress BCT-mediated transcription both in prostate cancer and colon cancer cells (Chesire and Isaacs, 2002). In this study, we validate such findings and show that repression of BCT signaling is facilitated by competition between the AR and Tcf. Measurements of the Tcf transcriptional reporter (<b>TOPFLASH)</b> indicated that AR+DHT-mediated repression can inhibit BCT transcription in the presence of WT and exogenous activating -catenin (1 - 130 bp). Transient transfections in SW 480 cells (APCmut/mut) showed that this mode of repression is functionally independent of APC-mediated -catenin ubiquitination. Using a recently developed red flourescent protein (HcRed), we demonstrate novel observations about the nuclear distribution of Tcf. Furthermore, with the use of red (HcRed-AR and HcRed-Tcf) and green fusion proteins (-catenin-EGFP), we provide morphological evidence of a reciprocal balance of nuclear -catenin-EGFP (BC-EGFP). By cotransfecting in LNCaP prostate tumor cells and using quantitative imaging software, we demonstrated a 62. 0 % colocalization of HcRed-AR and BC-EGFP in the presence of DHT and 63. 3 % colocalization of HcRed-Tcf/BC-EGFP in the absence of DHT. Costaining for activated RNA Pol II (phosphoserine 2) and HcRed-Tcf suggested that Tcf foci contain transcriptional 'hotspots' validating that these sites have the capacity for transcriptional activity. Given this apparent androgen-dependent competition for nuclear BC-EGFP, we chose to assess our hypothesis by in vivo and in vitro binding assays. SW 480 cells transiently transfected with an AR expression construct, treated with DHT and immunoprecipitated for Tcf showed less associated -catenin when compared to Tcf precipitates from untreated cells. Furthermore, by treating cells with DHT+Casodex, we were able to abrogate the androgen-sensitive AR/-catenin interaction, in addition to relieving transcriptional repression of the <b>TOPFLASH</b> reporter. In vitro binding assays, with increasing amounts of ARS 35, resulted in decreased TcfS 35 association with immunoprecipitated recombinant -catenin-HIS. These data suggest that in steady-state conditions, AR has the ability to compete out Tcf binding for -catenin. Finally, using SW 480 cells, we show that AR-mediated repression of the BCT pathway has implications for cell cycle progression and in vitro growth. Using FACs analysis, we observed a 26. 1 % increase in accumulation of cells in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle, while in vitro growth assays showed a 35 % reduction in viable cells transfected with AR+DHT treatment. Together, our data strongly suggest that a reciprocal balance of nuclear -catenin facilitates AR-mediated repression of BCT-driven transcription and cell growth...|$|E
40|$|Abnormal {{activation}} of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling is implicated in the osteoarthritis (OA) pathology. We searched for a pre-approved drug that suppresses abnormally activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling and has a potency to reduce joint pathology in OA. We introduced the <b>TOPFlash</b> reporter plasmid into HCS- 2 / 8 human chondrosarcoma cells to estimate the Wnt/β-catenin activity {{in the presence of}} 10 μM each compound in a panel of pre-approved drugs. We found that fluoxetine, an antidepressant in the class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), down-regulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in human chondrosarcoma cells. Fluoxetine inhibited both Wnt 3 A- and LiCl-induced loss of proteoglycans in chondrogenically differentiated ATDC 5 cells. Fluoxetine increased expression of Sox 9 (the chondrogenic master regulator), and decreased expressions of Axin 2 (a marker for Wnt/β-catenin signaling) and Mmp 13 (matrix metalloproteinase 13). Fluoxetine suppressed a LiCl-induced increase of total β-catenin and a LiCl-induced decrease of phosphorylated β-catenin in a dose-dependent manner. An in vitro protein-binding assay showed that fluoxetine enhanced binding of β-catenin with Axin 1, which is a scaffold protein forming the degradation complex for β-catenin. Fluoxetine suppressed LiCl-induced β-catenin accumulation in human OA chondrocytes. Intraarticular injection of fluoxetine in a rat OA model ameliorated OA progression and suppressed β-catenin accumulation...|$|E
40|$|Injury of the tubular {{epithelium}} and TGF-β 1 -induced {{conversion of}} epithelial cells to α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) -expressing myofibroblasts are key features of kidney fibrosis. Since injury damages intercellular junctions and promotes fibrosis, {{we hypothesized that}} cell contacts are critical regulators of TGF-β 1 -triggered epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here we show that TGF-β 1 was unable to induce EMT in intact confluent monolayers, but three different models of injury-induced loss of epithelial integrity (subconfluence, wounding, and contact disassembly by Ca 2 +-removal) restored its EMT-inducing effect. This manifested in loss of E-cadherin, increased fibronectin production and SMA expression. TGF-β 1 or contact disassembly alone only modestly stimulated the SMA promoter in confluent layers, but together exhibited strong synergy. Since β-catenin is a component of intact adherens junctions, but when liberated from destabilized contacts may act as a transcriptional co-activator, we investigated its role in TGF-β 1 -provoked EMT. Contact disassembly alone induced degradation of E-cadherin and β-catenin, but TGF-β 1 selectively rescued β-catenin and stimulated the β-catenin-driven reporter <b>TopFLASH.</b> Moreover, chelation of free β-catenin with the N-cadherin cytoplasmic tail suppressed the TGF-β 1 plus contact disassembly-induced SMA promoter activation and protein expression. These results suggest a β-catenin-dependent two-hit mechanism in which both an initial epithelial injury and TGF-β 1 are required for EMT...|$|E
40|$|Osteosarcoma (OS) is {{a primary}} {{malignant}} bone tumor with a high propensity for local recurrence and distant metastasis. We previously showed a secreted, dominant-negative LRP 5 receptor (DNLRP 5) suppressed in vitro migration and invasion of the OS cell line SaOS- 2. Therefore, we hypothesized DNLRP 5 also has in vivo antitumor activity against OS. We used the 143 B cell line as a model to study the effect of DNLRP 5 by stable transfection. Inhibition of Wnt signaling by DNLRP 5 was verified by a reduction in <b>TOPFLASH</b> luciferase activity. In soft agar, DNLRP 5 -transfected 143 B cells formed fewer and smaller colonies than control transfected cells. DNLRP 5 transfection reduced in vivo tumor growth of 143 B cells in nude mice. DNLRP 5 also decreased in vitro cellular motility in a scratch wound assay. In a spontaneous pulmonary metastasis model, DNLRP 5 reduced both the size and number of lung metastatic nodules. The reduction in cellular invasiveness by DNLRP 5 was associated with decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinase- 2, N-cadherin, and Snail. Our data suggest canonical Wnt/LRP 5 signaling reflects an important underlying mechanism of OS progression. Therefore, strategies to suppress LRP 5 -mediated signaling in OS cells {{may lead to a}} reduction in local or systemic disease burden...|$|E
40|$|Barrett's {{metaplasia}} (BM) is {{an early}} lesion in the progression from oesophageal inflammation through dysplasia {{to the development of}} Barrett's adenocarcinoma (BA). Previous work indicates that BM and BA are associated with reduced E-cadherin expression and increased cytoplasmic/nuclear pools of its associated protein beta-catenin. beta-catenin participates in Wnt signalling and activates oncogene transcription by complexing with T-cells factors (TCF). One such oncogene is c-myc. We have previously shown that TNF-alpha can down-regulate E-cadherin expression. Here, we assess TNF-alpha expression in Barrett's metaplasia and examine if TNF-alpha can promote beta-catenin mediated transcription of oncogenes in a gastrointestinal model system. Employing immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis of oesophageal tissue, epithelial expression of TNF-alpha increases with progression along the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence (P&# 60; 0. 001). beta-catenin mediated transcription was then assessed in TNF-alpha stimulated cell lines using the <b>TOPFLASH</b> reporter system whilst c-myc expression was assessed by real time PCR. In a columnar intestinal cell model, TNF-alpha induces c-myc expression which is induced via beta-catenin mediated transcription (P&# 60; 0. 05). This beta-catenin mediated transcription is independent of NF-kappaB activation. Thus, TNF-alpha is up-regulated in the progression of Barrett's oesophagus and beta-catenin mediated transcription of c-myc is a novel pathway whereby elevated levels of TNF-alpha may lead to oncogene transcription and altered biology in gastrointestinal epithelia and metaplasia...|$|E
40|$|B-Catenin, {{the chief}} oncogenic {{component}} of the ca-nonical Wnt pathway, {{is known to be}} involved in a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although the mechanism of B-catenin activation in HCC is multifactorial, it is indisputably implicated at various stages of hepatocarcinogenesis, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Here we investigate the effect of small interfering RNA–mediated B-catenin knockdown on the growth and survival of human hepa-toma cell lines with (HepG 2) and without (Hep 3 B) B-catenin mutations. Transfection of HepG 2 and Hep 3 B cells with human B-catenin (CTNNB 1) small interfer-ing RNA resulted in a significant B-catenin decrease, as confirmed by Western blot analyses and immuno-fluorescence, also leading to decreased expression of known target genes such as cyclin D 1 and glutamine synthetase. The decrease in B-catenin activity was con-firmed by <b>TOPflash</b> reporter luciferase assay. The func-tional impact of diminished B-catenin was exhibited as temporal decrease in tumor cell viability by the MTT assay. A concomitant decrease in tumor cell prolifera-tion was also evident with [3 H]thymidine incorporation and verified with soft agar assays. Thus, B-catenin is essential for the survival and growth of hepatoma cells independent of mutations in the B-catenin gene and provide a proof of principle for the significance of the therapeutic inhibition of B-catenin in HCC...|$|E
40|$|Extra-pancreatic {{metastasis}} is {{a difficult}} problem for surgical intervention in pancreatic cancer. CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR 4) was considered to {{have an important role}} in this process. We hypothesized it may contribute to the pancreatic cancer progression through influencing canonical Wnt pathway. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the functional role of CXCR 4 in the progression of pancreatic cancers and explore the possible mechanism. To this end, the relation between CXCR 4 and clinical characteristics was analysed. shRNA against CXCR 4 was applied to disrupt the SDF- 1 /CXCR 4 signal transduction pathways in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Our results showed that overall survival in the case of patients positive for CXCR 4 expression was significantly lower than that in the case of patients negative for CXCR 4 expression. Notably, in vitro studies we observed that the abrogation of CXCR 4 could obviously influence the pancreatic cancer cell phenotype including cell proliferation, colony formation, cell invasion and also inhibit the <b>TOPflash</b> activity. In addition, Wnt target genes and mesenchymal markers such as Vimentin and Slug were also inhibited in CXCR 4 knockdown cells. Collectively, these data reported here demonstrate CXCR 4 could modulate the canonical Wnt pathway and perhaps be a promising therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer progression...|$|E
40|$|ILKAP, {{a protein}} serine/threonine (S/T) {{phosphatase}} of the PP 2 C family, was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen baited with integrin-linked kinase, ILK 1. Association of ILK 1 and ILKAP was {{independent of the}} catalytic activity of either partner, as assayed in co-precipitation and two-hybrid experiments. Condi tional expression of ILKAP in HEK  293 cells resulted in selective inhibition of ECM- and growth factor-stimulated ILK 1 activity, but did not inhibit Raf- 1 kinase activity. A catalytic mutant of ILKAP, H 154 D, did not inhibit ILK 1 kinase activity. Two cellular targets of ILK 1, glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK 3 β) and protein kinase B (PKB) /AKT, were differentially affected by ILKAP-mediated inhibition of ILK 1. Catalytically active, but not mutant ILKAP, strongly inhibited insulin-like growth factor- 1 -stimulated GSK 3 β phosphorylation on Ser 9, but did not affect phosphorylation of PKB on Ser 473, suggesting that ILKAP selectively affects ILK-mediated GSK 3 β signalling. Consistent with this, active, but not H 154 D mutant or the related PP 2 Cα, selectively inhibited transactivation of a Tcf/Lef reporter gene, <b>TOPFlash,</b> in 293 cells. We propose that ILKAP regulates ILK 1 activity, targeting ILK 1 signalling of Wnt pathway components via modulation of GSK 3 β phosphorylation...|$|E

To assess Tcl 1 ’s roles in ES cells, we generated Tcl 1 -deficient and-overexpressing mouse ES cell lines. We found that Tcl 1 was neither essential nor sufficient {{for maintaining the}} undifferentiated state. Tcl 1 is reported to activate Akt and to enhance cell proliferation. We found that Tcl 1 expression levels correlated positively with the proliferation rate and negatively with the apoptosis of ES cells, but did not affect Akt phosphorylation. On the other hand, the phosphorylation level of b-catenin decreased in response to Tcl 1 overexpression. We measured the b-catenin activity using the <b>TOPflash</b> reporter assay, and found that wild-type ES cells had low activity, which Tcl 1 overexpression enhanced 1. 8 -fold. When the canonical Wnt signaling is activated by b-catenin stabilization, it reportedly helps maintain ES cells in the undifferentiated state. We then performed DNA microarray analyses between the Tcl 1 -deficient and-expressing ES cells. The results revealed that Tcl 1 expression downregulated a distinct group of genes, including Ndp 52, whose expression is very high in blastocysts but reduced in the primitive ectoderm. Based on these results, we discuss the possible roles of Tcl 1 in ES cells...|$|E

However, the mechanism was largely unknown. Gene chip array reveals that with berberine treatment, c-Myc, the target gene of Wnt pathway, was down-regulated 5. 3 -folds, indicating that berberine might inhibit Wnt signalling. <b>TOPflash</b> analysis revealed that Wnt activity was significantly reduced after berberine treatment, and the mechanism of which might be that berberine disrupted -catenin transfer to nucleus through up-regulating the expression of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and stabilized APC [...] catenin complex. Berberine administration in ApcMin/+ mice exhibited fewer and smaller polyps in intestine, along with reduction in cyclin D 1 and c-Myc expression. In clinical practice, oral administration of berberine also significantly reduced the familial adenomatous polyposis patients' polyp size along with the inhibition of cyclin D 1 expression in polyp samples. These observations indicate that berberine inhibits colon tumour formation through inhibition of Wnt/-catenin signalling and berberine might be a promising drug for the prevention of colon cancer...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe cancer {{stem cell}} {{hypothesis}} asserts that malignancies arise in tissue stem and/or progenitor cells through the dysregulation or acquisition of self-renewal. In order {{to determine whether the}} dietary polyphenols, curcumin, and piperine are able to modulate the self-renewal of normal and malignant breast stem cells, we examined the effects of these compounds on mammosphere formation, expression of the breast stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and Wnt signaling. Mammosphere formation assays were performed after curcumin, piperine, and control treatment in unsorted normal breast epithelial cells and normal stem and early progenitor cells, selected by ALDH positivity. Wnt signaling was examined using a <b>Topflash</b> assay. Both curcumin and piperine inhibited mammosphere formation, serial passaging, and percent of ALDH+ cells by 50 % at 5 mu M and completely at 10 mu M concentration in normal and malignant breast cells. There was no effect on cellular differentiation. Wnt signaling was inhibited by both curcumin and piperine by 50 % at 5 mu M and completely at 10 mu M. Curcumin and piperine separately, and in combination, inhibit breast stem cell self-renewal but do not cause toxicity to differentiated cells. These compounds could be potential cancer preventive agents. Mammosphere formation assays may be a quantifiable biomarker to assess cancer preventive agent efficacy and Wnt signaling assessment can be a mechanistic biomarker for use in human clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHepatic {{epithelial}} morphogenesis, including hepatoblast {{migration and}} proliferation in the septum transversum, requires {{the interaction of}} hepatic epithelium with the embryonic sinusoidal wall. No factors that mediate this interaction have yet been identified. As the β-catenin pathway is active in hepatoblast proliferation, then Wnt ligands might activate the canonical Wnt pathway during liver development. Here, we investigated the role of Wnts in mediating epithelial vessel interactions in the developing chick liver. We found that Wnt 9 a was specifically expressed in both endothelial and stellate cells of the embryonic sinusoidal wall. Induced overexpression of Wnt 9 a resulted in hepatomegaly with hyperplasia of the hepatocellular cords, and in hyperproliferation of hepatocytes. Knockdown of Wnt 9 a caused a reduction in liver size, with hypoplasia of hepatocellular cord branching, and hypoproliferation of hepatoblasts, and also inhibited glycogen accumulation at later developmental stages. Wnt 9 a promoted in vivo stabilization of β-catenin through binding with Frizzled 4, 7, and 9, and activated <b>TOPflash</b> reporter expression in vitro via Frizzled 7 and 9. Our results demonstrate that Wnt 9 a from the embryonic sinusoidal wall {{is required for the}} proper morphogenesis of chick hepatocellular cords, proliferation of hepatoblasts/hepatocytes, and glycogen accumulation in hepatocytes.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionEsophageal cancer {{remains a}} highly lethal malignancy, with {{therapeutic}} options of limited efficacy {{in the majority}} of patients. Understanding the molecular events involved in the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer offers insight into potential targets for treatment. Beta catenin and Wnt signaling abnormalities are involved in the development of both adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma of the esophagus. We hypothesized that down-regulation of beta catenin would inhibit the growth of human esophageal cancer. MethodsA human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line (TE 10) was treated with phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides to beta catenin. The cells were subsequently assayed for beta catenin mRNA and protein by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Beta catenin transcriptional activity was determined by <b>TOPFlash</b> assay. Cell viability and growth was assessed by methyl-thiazol-diphenyl-tetrazolium assay and trypan blue exclusion. A colorimetric assay was employed to assess caspase 3 activity, and flow cytometry was done to determine percentage of cells in a given phase of the cell cycle. ResultsFollowing antisense treatment, beta catenin mRNA and protein concentration were decreased. There was corresponding decrease in beta catenin–transcription factor–dependent transcription. Treatment with beta catenin antisense resulted in significantly decreased cell viability and proliferation. The mechanism appears to be increased induction of apoptosis. ConclusionsThese data suggest a potential role for the targeting of beta catenin in the treatment of esophageal cancer...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{embryonic}} development skeletal elements form either through intramembranous or endochondral ossification. Wnt proteins play diverse roles during vertebrate skeletal development. Wnt 16 is {{a key factor in}} developing long bones, but its exact role in craniofacial bone formation remains unclear. This study was initially undertaken to investigate the expression of Wnt 16 during craniofacial bone development in mouse embryos. Wnt 16 expression in the osteoid of calvaria, maxilla, and mandible started later than that of ALP and osteocalcin (OCN), but before mineralization of the craniofacial bones, suggesting that Wnt 16 is involved in intramembranous ossification in the head. To confirm this, MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells were transfected with an adenovirus containing Wnt 16 (Ad-Wnt 16). Ad-Wnt 16 cells showed decreased ALP activity and less mineralized nodule formations compared with control cells. In addition, the mRNA levels of osteogenic markers were reduced. Moreover, Wnt 16 activated beta-catenin signaling in MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells at both transcription and protein levels as shown by a <b>TOPflash</b> luciferase reporter gene assay and western blot analysis. On the other hand, Wnt/beta-catenin pathway blockade by Dickkopf 1 abrogated the suppression of mineralization by Wnt 16.

Large subsets of HCC demonstrate Wnt/β-catenin activation, making this an attractive therapeutic target. We report strategy and characterization of a novel small-molecule inhibitor, ICG- 001, known to affect Wnt signaling by disrupting β-catenin–CREB binding protein interactions. We queried the ZINC online database for structural similarity to ICG- 001 and identified PMED- 1 as the lead compound, with ≥ 70 % similarity to ICG- 001. PMED- 1 significantly reduced β-catenin activity in hepatoblastoma and several HCC cells, as determined by <b>TOPflash</b> reporter assay, with an IC 50 ranging from 4. 87 to 32 μmol/L. Although no toxicity was observed in primary human hepatocytes, PMED- 1 inhibited Wnt target expression in HCC cells, including those with CTNNB 1 mutations, and impaired cell proliferation and viability. PMED- 1 treatment decreased β-catenin–CREB binding protein interactions without affecting total β-catenin levels or activity of other common kinases. PMED- 1 treatment of Tg(OTM:d 2 EGFP) zebrafish expressing GFP under the β-catenin/Tcf reporter led to a notable decrease in β-catenin activity. The PMED effect on β-catenin signaling lasted from 12 to 24 hours in vitro and 6 to 15 hours in vivo. Thus, using a rapid and cost-effective computational methodology, we have identified a novel and specific small-molecule inhibitor of Wnt signaling that may have implications for HCC treatment...|$|E
40|$|Robinow {{syndrome}} (RS) is a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous {{condition that}} {{can be caused by}} mutations in genes encoding components of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway. In contrast, germline mutations that act to increase canonical Wnt signaling lead to distinctive osteosclerotic phenotypes. Here, we identified de novo frameshift mutations in DVL 1, a mediator of both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling, as the cause of RS-OS, an RS subtype involving osteosclerosis, in three unrelated individuals. The mutations all delete the DVL 1 C terminus and replace it, in each instance, with a novel, highly basic sequence. We showed the presence of mutant transcript in fibroblasts from one individual with RS-OS and demonstrated unimpaired protein stability with transfected GFP-tagged constructs bearing a frameshift mutation. In vitro <b>TOPFlash</b> assays, in apparent contradiction to the osteosclerotic phenotype, revealed that the mutant allele was less active than the wild-type allele in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. However, when the mutant and wild-type alleles were co-expressed, canonical Wnt activity was 2 -fold higher than that in the wild-type construct alone. This work establishes that DVL 1 mutations cause a specific RS subtype, RS-OS, and that the osteosclerosis associated with this subtype might be the result of an interaction between the wild-type and mutant alleles and thus lead to elevated canonical Wnt signaling...|$|E
