5|$|By {{the time}} the advance units of the Leningrad Front arrived at <b>Tallinn</b> early on 22 September, German troops had {{practically}} abandoned {{the city and the}} streets were empty. The last German unit to leave <b>Tallinn</b> that morning was the 531st Navy Artillery Battalion. Before embarkation, all stationary artillery and armaments, special equipment, guns that could not be evacuated, ammunition, the telephone exchange, the radio broadcast house, locomotives and railroad cars, and the railway were destroyed. The <b>Tallinn</b> power plant was fired upon from the sea and the Old City Harbour was destroyed. The retreating German units had no combat contact with the Red Army in <b>Tallinn.</b> The Government of Estonia had failed to concentrate the Estonian soldiers retreating from the Narva and Emajõgi fronts, as the units were scattered and mixed with the German detachments withdrawing towards Latvia. Therefore, the government lacked significant military forces to repulse the Soviet forces concentrated around <b>Tallinn.</b> The units securing the national capital and the government were led by Rear Admiral Johan Pitka. Troops of the Leningrad Front seized <b>Tallinn</b> on 22 September. Jüri Uluots, acting President of Estonia, evacuated to Sweden. In the following days, several pro-independence Estonian battle groups attacked the Soviet troops in Harju and Lääne counties without success.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet forces {{attempted}} to capture Estonia and its capital <b>Tallinn.</b> Stavka hoped a quick breakthrough at the Emajõgi front would open {{a path for}} the armoured units to the north, thus cutting the Army Detachment Narwa {{off from the rest}} of Army Group North. The Red Army command presumed that the main direction of retreat for the German forces would be <b>Tallinn,</b> and concentrated their forces there in an attempt to block the roads.|$|E
5|$|The oil shale-fired {{electrical}} power industry started in 1924 when the <b>Tallinn</b> Power Station switched to oil shale. In 1933, it reached {{a capacity of}} 22megawatts (MW). Other oil shale-fired power stations were built in Püssi (3.7MW), Kohtla (3.7MW), Kunda (2.3MW), and Kiviõli (0.8MW). At the beginning of World War II, the total capacity of oil shale-fired power stations was 32.5MW. Only the <b>Tallinn</b> and Püssi power stations were connected to the grid.|$|E
5|$|Gorky {{had a new}} bow section {{fabricated}} in Kronstadt and it was mated {{with the}} ship on 21 July. Kirov provided gunfire support during the defense of <b>Tallinn</b> and served as the flagship of the evacuation fleet from <b>Tallinn</b> to Leningrad {{at the end of}} August 1941. For {{most of the rest of}} the war both cruisers were blockaded in Leningrad and Kronstadt by Axis minefields and could only provide gunfire support for the defenders during the Siege of Leningrad and support for the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive in mid—1944. Both ships were damaged by German air and artillery attacks, but were repaired during the war.|$|E
5|$|In late 1941, the Einsatzkommandos {{settled into}} {{headquarters}} in Kovno, Riga, and <b>Tallinn.</b> Einsatzgruppe A grew less mobile and faced problems {{because of its}} small size. The Germans relied increasingly on the Arājs Kommando and similar groups to perform massacres of Jews.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September 1902, {{the ninth}} {{anniversary of the}} loss of the ship, a {{monument}} to Rusalka was erected in <b>Tallinn.</b> Sculpted by Amandus Adamson, it {{takes the form of a}} bronze angel standing on a granite pedestal.|$|E
5|$|The film's foreign {{rights were}} picked up by Loic Magneron's Wide Management, a Paris-based sales-production-distribution house. The deal was {{finalised}} after a meeting between Magneron and Saria at the film's <b>Tallinn</b> premiere. However, the distribution rights were withdrawn when the producers entered into negotiations with Netflix. The worldwide rights of the film were acquired by Netflix in April 2017.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Nürnberg {{was seized}} by the Royal Navy and {{ultimately}} awarded to the Soviet Union as war reparations. In December 1945, a Soviet crew took over the ship, and the following month took her to <b>Tallinn,</b> where she was renamed Admiral Makarov. She served in the Soviet Navy, first in the 8th Fleet, then as a training cruiser based in Kronstadt. By 1960, she had been broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Hanseatic League in Lübeck in 1499, they applied once more to the bishop for {{permission}} to build a beacon. On 20 April 1500 Bishop Johannes III Orgas (John Orgies) agreed to allow a massive stone pillar without any openings. To cover the building costs, <b>Tallinn</b> city council had to establish a special lighthouse tax until the sum was complete.|$|E
5|$|Attacks by the Leningrad Front {{had pushed}} Army Group North west of Lake Peipus, {{resulting}} {{in a series of}} operations around Narva. In the south, Soviet forces had advanced towards the Baltic coast at the end of Operation Bagration the Belorussian strategic offensive (June–August 1944) against Army Group Centre. The Soviet <b>Tallinn</b> Offensive was designed {{as a part of the}} Baltic Offensive to eliminate the positions of Army Group North along the Baltic.|$|E
5|$|Building of {{the beacon}} was {{supposed}} to start {{in the summer of}} 1500, but the building was stopped when Wolter von Plettenberg, master of the Livonian Order, started a war which lasted until 1503. In the spring of 1504, purchase and delivery of the building materials began, but in the autumn of the same year the plague broke out, stopping the work once more. Building work was discontinued and alderman Lambert Ottingk, the magistrate in charge of the building, died in <b>Tallinn</b> on 28 December 1505.|$|E
5|$|Kalep took up {{flying in}} the late 1920s, when she met Dutch aviator Anthony Fokker while holidaying in St. Moritz {{and asked him to}} teach her to fly a plane. She {{completed}} five hours of flying with Fokker and, after breaking her arm during a sledding accident in the winter of 1931, took her pilot's test in Germany on 1 August 1931. She passed, becoming the first qualified female pilot from Estonia, and the seventh woman to pass the exam in Germany. Soon after receiving her license, Kalep and Valter Mayer, a German mechanic, co-piloted a small Klemm plane from Berlin through Eastern Europe, stopping in Szczecin, Gdańsk, Kaunas, Jelgava and Riga, finally landing in <b>Tallinn</b> on 18 August. Upon her arrival in <b>Tallinn,</b> Kalep was greeted by a crowd of journalists and officers of the Estonian Air Force; she briefly visited relatives in Nõmme before beginning her return journey to Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|The account ledgers of <b>Tallinn</b> {{city council}} contain entries about the Kõpu {{lighthouse}} from 1507 to 1533, showing money {{was spent on}} the beacon of Hiiumaa from 13 May 1514 until 12 October 1532. The amounts show {{the majority of the}} work took place from 1514 to 1519; later there are only a couple of bigger expenditures on the beacon. A fire was first lit in the autumn of 1531; it was simply a bonfire on top of the tower.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Nürnberg {{was seized}} by the Royal Navy and {{ultimately}} awarded to the Soviet Union as war reparations. In December 1945, a Soviet crew took over the ship, and the following month took her to <b>Tallinn,</b> where she was renamed Admiral Makarov. She served in the Soviet Navy, first in the 8th Fleet, then as a training cruiser based in Kronstadt. Her ultimate fate is unclear, but by 1960, she had been broken up for scrap. Nürnberg was the second-largest warship of the Kriegsmarine to survive the war intact, after the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen, and she was the only vessel to see service after the war, albeit in a foreign navy.|$|E
5|$|Both {{monitors}} were reclassified as coast-defense ironclads on 13 February 1892 and Rusalka sank in a {{storm on}} 7 September 1893 during a voyage between Reval (<b>Tallinn)</b> and Helsingfors (Helsinki) {{with the loss of}} her entire crew of 177 officers and enlisted men. Despite an extensive search, the only traces of her found were one body and some debris that washed ashore. Charodeika remained in service until 31 March 1907 when she was turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal. The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 7 April and was finally scrapped in 1911–12.|$|E

5|$|Following the Soviet {{capture of}} that city, the {{remaining}} crew detonated scuttling {{charges in the}} wreck on 21 March to further destroy the ship. After the war, the ship was raised during 1945–46 by the Soviet Navy and transferred to <b>Tallinn.</b> Although reference books long stated that she was scrapped there or in Marienburg, in actuality she was towed out in 1948 and beached for long-term use as a target in shallow water off the island of Osmussaar in the Gulf of Finland. Last used for target practice around 1966, the remains are now submerged. Her bell {{was held in the}} collection of the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden as of 1990.|$|E

5|$|On 26 March 1944, the Strachwitz Battle Group {{consisting}} of the German 170th, 11th, and 227th Infantry Divisions and tanks, attacked the flanks of the Soviet 109th Rifle Corps south of the <b>Tallinn</b> railway, supported by an air strike. The tanks led the attack and the East Prussian grenadiers followed, penetrating the fortified positions of the Soviet rifle corps. By {{the end of the}} day, the Soviet 72nd and parts of the 109th Rifle Corps in the Westsack (west sack) of the bridgehead were encircled.

5|$|Soviet air assaults {{against civilians}} in Estonian towns {{were a part}} of the offensive, aimed at forcing the Estonians away from {{supporting}} the German side. The Soviet Long Range Aviation branch assaulted the Estonian capital of <b>Tallinn</b> on the night of 8–9 March. Approximately 40% of the housing was destroyed in the city; 25,000 people were left homeless and 500 civilians were killed. The result of the air raid was the opposite of what the Soviets intended, as people felt disgusted by the Soviet atrocities; more men answered the German conscription call.|$|E

5|$|The {{participation}} of Marat and Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya in the Winter War {{was limited to}} a bombardment of Finnish coastal artillery in December 1939 at Saarenpää in the Beryozovye Islands before the Gulf of Finland iced over. They failed to inflict any permanent damage before being driven off by near misses. Both ships had their anti-aircraft armament modernized and reinforced over the winter of 1939–40 and were transferred to <b>Tallinn</b> shortly after the Soviets occupied Estonia in 1940. Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya received more AA guns in February–March 1941. Parizhskaya Kommuna received a more modest number of AA guns while she was receiving her bulges, but landed four 120-mm guns right before the Germans invaded.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a year of}} {{arriving}} in Harbin, China, Kalep's son died and her husband disappeared. Kalep was able to support herself by working as an interpreter—she spoke Russian, German, English and Chinese—for a British general in Shenyang. She was also employed by Zhang Zuolin and later his son, Zhang Xueliang, but {{decided to return to}} Estonia in 1925.

5|$|Admiral Makarov {{was built}} by Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée in La Seyne-sur-Mer, France. The ship was laid down in April 1905, and she was {{launched}} on 28 May 1906. Admiral Makarov was completed in April 1908. The ship sailed for the Baltic on 27 May and reached <b>Tallinn,</b> Estonia on 11 June where she {{was assigned to the}} Baltic Fleet. A few months later, she returned to the Mediterranean and provided assistance to the survivor of the Messina earthquake in December. The ship then rejoined the Baltic Fleet, but she was transferred back to Mediterranean in 1910 where she represented the Russian Empire, together with the battleship , the armored cruiser , and the protected cruiser , at the coronation of Nicholas I of Montenegro in August 1910. Admiral Makarov was back in the Baltic during 1911 and she made a port visit to Copenhagen in 1912.

5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, Estonian {{oil shale}} was {{described}} by several scientists and used as a low-grade fuel. Its use in industry commenced in 1916. Production of shale oil began in 1921 and oil shale was first used to generate electrical power in 1924. Shortly thereafter, systematic research into oil shale and its products began, and in 1938 a department of mining was established at <b>Tallinn</b> Technical University. After World War II, Estonian oil shale gas was used in Saint Petersburg (then called Leningrad) and in northern cities in Estonia {{as a substitute for}} natural gas. Increased need for electricity in the north-west of the Soviet Union led to the construction of large oil shale-fired power stations. Oil shale extraction peaked in 1980. Subsequently, the launch of nuclear reactors in Russia, particularly the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station, reduced demand for electricity produced from oil shale, and, along with a post-Soviet restructuring of the industry in the 1990s, led to a decrease in oil shale mining. After decreasing for two decades, oil shale mining started to increase again {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Kalep {{was born}} on 26 June 1899 {{in the village of}} Taali in Tori Parish, Pärnu County. She was the only child of Joanna (née Liidemann) and {{locksmith}} Aksel Emil, who both died when she was a young girl. She attended Tallinna Tütarlaste Kommertsgümnaasium, a girls' secondary school in <b>Tallinn.</b> As a teenager, Kalep moved to Russia to live with an aunt in Saint Petersburg. She witnessed the events that sparked the February Revolution in 1917, and spent a night in police detention as an eyewitness. She made a failed attempt to flee {{at the outset of the}} revolution, during which time she witnessed six men being shot while waiting in line to buy train tickets out of the country. She and her aunt moved to Vladivostok, where she married a Russian general, Count Slastšov, and had a son. She lived in Vladivostok for eight years, during which time she made numerous escape efforts, before her new family was able to successfully flee to China, a refuge they chose because of Slastšov's ties to Zhang Zuolin.|$|E
