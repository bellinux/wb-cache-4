5|$|Due to {{its heavy}} losses, <b>the</b> <b>Take</b> Ichi convoy {{was ordered to}} dock at Halmahera in the eastern NEI rather than {{continue}} to New Guinea. The surviving ships arrived there on 9 May. Both divisions and their equipment were unloaded and the convoy sailed for Manila on 13 May, arriving on 20 May without further loss.|$|E
5|$|As of 2004, hunting was {{restricted}} to a few animals each year off the Caribbean island of Bequia in the nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. <b>The</b> <b>take</b> is not believed to threaten the local population. Japan had planned to kill 50 humpbacks in the 2007/08 season under its JARPA II research program. The announcement sparked global protests. After a visit to Tokyo by the IWC chair asking the Japanese for their co-operation in sorting out the differences between pro- and antiwhaling nations on the commission, the Japanese whaling fleet agreed to take no humpback whales during the two years {{it would take to}} reach a formal agreement.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, DiCaprio starred as villainous Calvin Candie in Quentin Tarantino's {{spaghetti}} western, Django Unchained. While filming Django Unchained, DiCaprio accidentally cut {{his hand}} on glass, but continued filming despite the injury, and Tarantino elected to use <b>the</b> <b>take</b> in the final movie. The film received positive reviews from critics and earned DiCaprio his ninth nomination from the Golden Globes. Django Unchained grossed $424 million worldwide.|$|E

40|$|After {{several decades}} of {{research}} on phraseology, {{one of the most}} controversial topics of this multi-faceted discipline remains the borderline between ordinary constructions (what John Sinclair called the open-choice principle) and phraseology (Sinclair's idiom principle). Consider a phrase such as <b>take</b> <b>the</b> example: is this just an open choice between a number of possibilities, in this case rather limited, or are we already dealing with some kind of communicative routine? The criterion of frequency might be invoked, but then you would have to conclude that 'take the third exit' is also a set phrase, because it is particularly frequent (on the Web at least). And what do you do with other borderline cases such as <b>take</b> <b>the</b> form, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> time, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> lead, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> necessary action, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> offensive, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> risk, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> same approach, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> train to, etc. ? Sweeping some of those cases aside by calling them light verb constructions does not solve the whole problem, because what is at stake here is probably a complex interplay between frequency and fixedness, that needs to be further explored...|$|R

In September, BLM activists shut down streets in Toronto, rallied against police brutality, and stood in solidarity with marginalized black lives. Black Lives Matter was a featured part of <b>the</b> <b>Take</b> Back the Night event in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Japanese naval staff {{officers}} {{gathered in}} Manila in June to analyze <b>the</b> <b>Take</b> Ichi convoy. The officers believed that Japan's communication codes were secure and discussed alternative {{explanations for the}} convoy's detection. These explanations included the increase in radio signals {{at the time the}} convoy sailed being detected by Allied radio traffic analysts, a Japanese officer in Manila accidentally divulging information and Allied spies working on the Manila waterfront radioing messages about the convoy's composition and departure. The meeting concluded that Allied spies were responsible for the convoy's detection, and the Japanese military's codes were not changed.|$|E
5|$|Producer Frank Marshall {{stated in}} 2003 {{that the film}} would use {{traditional}} stunt work {{so as to be}} consistent with the previous films. CGI was used to remove the visible safety wires on the actors when they did their stunts (such as when Indy swings on a lamp with his whip). Timed explosives were used for a scene where Indiana drives a truck through crates. During <b>the</b> <b>take,</b> an explosive failed to detonate and landed in the seat beside Ford. It did not go off and he was not injured.|$|E

One Direction embarked on their second concert tour in February 2013, <b>the</b> <b>Take</b> Me Home Tour. The concert tour consists of over 100 shows in Europe, North America and Australasia. Ticket sales reached 300,000 within a day of release in the UK and Ireland, which included a six-date sell-out at London's The O2 Arena. In the Australian and New Zealand markets, tickets grossed US$15.7million, with all 190,000 tickets being sold for the eighteen shows to be held. The tour received critical acclaim from music critics who praised the band's live vocals and their performance abilities and was a commercial success, selling 1,635,000 tickets from 134 shows.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Take</b> Ichi convoy resumed {{its journey}} to New Guinea on 1 May. Its {{composition}} was now eight transports (one of the Manila-bound transports having replaced Yoshida Maru) {{under the protection}} of Shirataka, Asakaze, Shiratsuyu, minesweeper W-22, CH-37 and CH-38. The convoy took a special route planned by the Third Southern Expeditionary Fleet {{to reduce the risk of}} submarine attack.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Take</b> Ichi convoy sailed from Shanghai {{bound for}} Manila on 17 April, and {{initially}} comprised 15 transports and the 6th Escort Convoy Command. Seven of the transports were traveling to Manila only and the 32nd and 35th Divisions were each carried by four vessels. Allied code breakers decrypted radio signals {{relating to the}} convoy's departure and subsequent intercepts allowed radio traffic analysts to follow its progress south.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Take</b> Ichi convoy was {{assembled}} at Shanghai in April 1944. Its {{task was}} to carry the 32nd Division to Mindanao and {{the main body of}} the 35th Division to western New Guinea. Both divisions had been formed in 1939 and were veterans of fighting in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. One of the 35th Division's three infantry regiments was detached from the division in early April and sent to the Palau islands, arriving there later that month without loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} the accident was a Boeing 707–465 registered G-ARWE (manufacturer's serial number 18373, Boeing line number 302). First flown on 27 June 1962, the aircraft was originally to have been operated by Cunard Eagle Airways, but before it entered service it was sold to BOAC-Cunard and was delivered on 7 July 1962. On 21 November 1967 the aircraft suffered an engine failure on take off from Honolulu International Airport. <b>The</b> <b>take</b> off was aborted, {{and there were no}} injuries to any of the passengers or crew. At the time of the Heathrow accident, the aircraft had flown for a total of 20,870 hours. The aircraft was insured for £2,200,000 with Lloyd's of London.|$|E
5|$|The {{attacks on}} <b>the</b> <b>Take</b> Ichi convoy blunted the 32nd and 35th Divisions' {{fighting}} power. The 32nd Division's combat elements were reduced from nine to five infantry battalions and {{from four to}} {{one and a half}} artillery battalions. Only four of the six 35th Division infantry battalions which sailed in the convoy reached Halmahera and much of the division's artillery was lost.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene in}} which Desmond goes nude {{swimming}} {{was not included in}} the same form in Etheridge's version of the episode; however, Thomas enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>take</b> that was eventually used more, so he put it in the final cut. Because the show could not show full nudity, they gave the stunt performer who was filling in for Rudd flesh-colored swim briefs and put him out of focus so they could notify the network that the man out of focus was indeed clothed. The lights that can be seen in the distant background of the scene illuminating the bay were placed nearly ten miles away by grips.|$|E

Near {{the time of the}} episode's airing, she had also appeared in Bruce Almighty and an episode of 30 Rock. When the episode's editor first received one take of the scene in which Veronica and Mac sarcastically dance in response to accusations of doing a poor job on a school project, the editor called the writing staff into the editing room; they proceeded to view the scene fifteen times because of its humorous nature. They immediately included <b>the</b> <b>take</b> in the final cut of the episode.|$|E

5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:00, {{the runway}} at Khâm Đức was cleared of the wrecked helicopter. Moments later, a C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Daryl D. Cole touched {{down on the}} runway under heavy fire, which flattened one tire and caused extensive damage to the wing tanks. Almost immediately, Cole's aircraft was rushed by hysterical Vietnamese civilians from ditches along the runway, filling the aircraft so the loadmaster was prevented from unloading the aircraft's cargo. Under heavy fire, Cole decided to navigate his aircraft down the cratered and shrapnel-littered runway, {{in order to take}} off. However, the combined weight of the cargo and civilians, in addition to the damage sustained during landing, prevented the aircraft from gathering enough speed to take off. So the aircrew aborted <b>the</b> <b>take</b> off, offloaded the civilians, and proceeded to cut off the blown tire to stop it from flapping and slowing down the aircraft. They were able to cut off the rubber with the bayonet, and were able to cut through the steel beading thanks to the engineers carefully cutting the steel cords with a blowtorch. A fire extinguisher was kept handy because of fear of catching the magnesium wheel on fire. About two hours later, realizing that enemy artillery rounds were coming closer to his aircraft, Colonel Cole tried to take off for the second time, and managed to get the C-130 into the air. This time his only passengers were three members of Air Force Combat Control Team (CCT), whose radio equipment had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Filming the pre-title {{sequence}} {{went through}} some alterations. One {{of the scenes}} saw Johnny being foot whipped, however the shot where the stick struck the soles of the feet was cut out due to its brutality. Also, when discussing how Johnny would be expelled from the mosque afterwards, Nalluri suggested using the idea where he is thrown {{to the top of}} the surveillance van, which would give the audience the impression that the antagonists were on to them. Later on in the episode, Nalluri wanted to include some exposition shots, which shows Khaldun's actions while he narrates them to MI5. In one scene, Tom observes Khaldun inside a prison cell by opening a slide view at the prison door. However one had to be made because no such doors exist in the United Kingdom. Following the broadcast of the episode, the producers were surprised to hear that the BBC were unhappy with a scene showing Harry holding a Costa Coffee cup, as the corporation believed it was done out of product placement. They were also surprised to learn that they did not take notice in a scene with Malcolm Wynn-Jones delightfully eating a piece of chocolate from a Black Magic chocolate box, which they thought was a more obvious example. Portraying actor Hugh Simon had to spit out the chocolate after <b>the</b> <b>take</b> as he disliked the confectionery.|$|E
5|$|In early 1944, Morotai {{became an}} area of {{importance}} to the Japanese military when it started developing the neighbouring larger island of Halmahera as {{a focal point for}} the defence of the southern approaches to the Philippines. In May 1944, the Imperial Japanese Army's 32nd Division arrived at Halmahera to defend the island and its nine airstrips. The division had suffered heavy losses when the convoy carrying it from China (<b>the</b> <b>Take</b> Ichi convoy) was attacked by US submarines. Two battalions from the 32nd Division's 211th Infantry Regiment were initially deployed to Morotai to develop an airstrip on the Doroeba Plain. Both battalions were withdrawn to Halmahera in mid-July, however, when the airstrip was abandoned because of drainage problems. Allied code breakers detected the Japanese build up at Halmahera and Morotai's weak defenses, and passed this information on to the relevant planning staff.|$|E
