40|$|As for a {{variable}} air volume (VAV) system, the air duct static pressure {{is a typical}} control variable maintained by modulating supply fan speed. The static pressure equals to the summation of the duct pressure loss downstream of the sensor to the <b>terminal</b> <b>box</b> and box inlet static pressure. Typically, the air duct static pressure is set as a constant set point based on the system design information and sensor location. However, under partial load conditions, the <b>terminal</b> <b>box</b> dampers have to be closed more since either required airflow {{is less than the}} design airflow which directly leads to much less pressure loss. Thus the static pressure set point should be reset lower in order to reduce fan power, avoid noise at <b>terminal</b> <b>box</b> dampers and box damper malfunction due to excessive pressure. Different static pressure reset schedules are reviewed and compared, considering the influence of outside air temperature on the building load, availability of the VAV box damper positions, the airflow ratio based static pressure reset has also applicable advantages over the existing constant static pressure set point and two typical reset methods. This paper present the theoretical models to express the impacts of static pressure reset on fan airflow, fan head, air leakage, fan power and thermal energy for both pressure independent and pressure dependent boxes.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{consider}} sets of factors {{of a given}} finite word over a finite alphabet which permit us to reconstruct the entire word. This analysis {{is based on the}} notion of special factor. A factor u of a finite word w is called right (resp. left) special if there exist two distinct letters x and y such that ux, uy (resp. xu, yu) are factors of w. A factor is bispecial if it is right and left special. A proper box of w is any factor of w of the kind asb, with a,b letters and s a bispecial factor of w. The initial (resp. <b>terminal)</b> <b>box</b> of w is the shortest prefix (resp. suffix) of w which is an unrepeated factor. A box is called maximal if it is not a proper factor of another box. The main result of the paper is the following theorem (maximal box theorem) : Any finite word w is uniquely determined by the initial <b>box,</b> the <b>terminal</b> <b>box</b> and the set of maximal boxes. A consequence is that a finite word w is uniquely determined by the knowledge of its factors up to the length n=max{Rw,Kw}+ 1, where Kw is the length of the <b>terminal</b> <b>box</b> and Rw is the minimal natural number {{for which there is no}} right special factor of length Rw. Some structural properties of boxes are studied. Another important combinatorial notion is that of superbox. A superbox is any factor of w of the kind asb, with a,b letters and such that s is a repeated factor, whereas as and sb are unrepeated factors. A theorem for superboxes similar to the maximal box theorem is proved. Some algorithms allowing us to construct boxes and superboxes and, conversely, to reconstruct the word are given. In this combinatorial frame we give an upper and a lower bound to the number of states of a minimal deterministic automaton recognizing the set of the factors of w. These bounds are sharper than the known bounds...|$|R

40|$|In a VAV (variable air volume) system, the {{set point}} of the static {{pressure}} (usually measured at 213 downstream of the main supply air duct) is maintained by modulating the fan speed or inlet guide vane position.

40|$|Single duct Variable Air Volume (VAV) {{systems are}} {{currently}} {{the most widely}} used type of HVAC system in the United States. When installing such a system, it is critical to determine the minimum airflow set point of the terminal box, as an optimally selected set point will improve the level of thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ) {{while at the same time}} lower overall energy costs. In principle, this minimum rate should be calculated according to the minimum ventilation requirement based on ASHRAE standard 62. 1 and maximum heating load of the zone. Several factors must be carefully considered when calculating this minimum rate. <b>Terminal</b> <b>boxes</b> with conventional control sequences may result in occupant discomfort and energy waste. If the minimum rate of airflow is set too high, the AHUs will consume excess fan power, and the <b>terminal</b> <b>boxes</b> may cause significant simultaneous room heating and cooling. At the same time, a rate that is too low will result in poor air circulation and indoor air quality in the air-conditioned space. ^ Currently, many scholars are investigating how to change the algorithm of the advanced VAV terminal box controller without retrofitting. Some of these controllers have been found to effectively improve thermal comfort, indoor air quality, and energy efficiency. However, minimum airflow set points have not yet been identified, nor has controller performance been verified in confirmed studies. ^ In this study, control algorithms were developed that automatically identify and reset terminal box minimum airflow set points, thereby improving indoor air quality and thermal comfort levels, and reducing the overall rate of energy consumption. A theoretical analysis of the optimal minimum airflow and discharge air temperature was performed to identify the potential energy benefits of resetting the terminal box minimum airflow set points. Applicable control algorithms for calculating the ideal values for the minimum airflow reset were developed and applied to actual systems for performance validation. The results of the theoretical analysis, numeric simulations, and experiments show that the optimal control algorithms can automatically identify the minimum rate of heating airflow under actual working conditions. Improved control helps to stabilize room air temperatures. The vertical difference in the room air temperature was lower than the comfort value. Measurements of room CO 2 levels indicate that when the minimum airflow set point was reduced it did not adversely affect the indoor air quality. According to the measured energy results, optimal control algorithms give a lower rate of reheating energy consumption than conventional controls. ...|$|E
