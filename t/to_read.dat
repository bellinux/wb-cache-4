40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} aims {{to answer a}} {{recently}} raised controversy regarding the role that morphological awareness has <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> skills acquisition in Brazilian Portuguese. The aim was to investigate whether morphological awareness contributes <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> after controlling for non-verbal intelligence and phonological awareness in Brazilian Portuguese variables. The study included 52 elementary school students enrolled {{in a public school}} in the municipality of São Gonçalo, state of Rio de Janeiro. The hierarchical regression analyses showed that derivational morphological awareness contributes <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> independently of phonological processing and non-verbal ability. The results {{of this study indicate that}} morphological awareness contributes <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> words but not <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension. The results of this study corroborate with the hypothesis that even in an alphabetic language, such as Portuguese, morphological awareness is important <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> acquisition...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} nature of teachers' {{understandings}} of theoretical orientation <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> and the relationships between theoretical orientations <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> and instructional practice. The participants were eleven Grade Five classroom teachers, seven female and four male, in one particular school board in Southern Ontario. A series of three in-depth, phenomenological {{interviews were conducted with}} each teacher-participant. Utilizing the concept of theoretical orientation <b>to</b> <b>reading,</b> understandings of and relationships between, theoretical orientation <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> and instructional practice were identified and described by the teachers in this study, from an 'emic' (insider) perspective. The themes of teachers' knowledge and beliefs, personal experiences, and constructivist approaches to teaching and learning emerged as highly influential in determining the kinds of instructional decisions made by the teacher participants. The data illustrate how teachers with a skills orientation <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> instruction supported a focus on explicit skills instruction within balanced, eclectic approaches <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> instruction. The results provide a multi-voice construction, showing how the teacher participants' knowledge, beliefs, personal and professional experiences were reflected not only in their efforts to articulate understandings of theoretical orientations <b>to</b> <b>reading,</b> but also in the characteristics of relationships between their theoretical orientation <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> and instructional practices. Patterns and themes in the data also indicate the need for improved pre-service teacher education, and relevant in-service professional development, to better meet the needs of contemporary teachers of reading at the junior division level...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} attitudes <b>to</b> leisure-time <b>reading</b> among pupils in grade 5. A subsidiary aim is to examine whether there is a difference between how boys and girls relate <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> books. The method used in the study is questionnaires and a focus group interview. The result shows a clear difference between boys’ and girls’ reading habits in leisure time. The girls devote more time in general than the boys <b>to</b> leisure-time <b>reading,</b> but sports activities and the computer are two phenomena that the pupils choose in preference <b>to</b> <b>reading.</b> In the study one can see a link between reading literature relatively frequently in leisure time and having a positive attitude <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> in school, which applies to both sexes. The pupils who seldom or never read in their leisure time are also more negatively disposed <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> in school, which applies chiefly to the boys...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the relations between home literacy environment, reading attitude, self-concept of reading, reading frequency and reading performance.

Questionnaires were assessed <b>to</b> address the <b>reading</b> development and resistance <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> was measured as an attentional bias toward reading stimuli using a visual dot probe test. Results show that the home literacy environment and self-concept of reading were positively related <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> attitude. Reading attitude and reading frequency were both positively related <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> performance. Results did not confirm an attentional bias in children with a negative reading attitude.

40|$|Master of EducationTheory of {{education}} {{stresses the importance}} of both the affective and cognitive domains in education. However, the affective domain receives less attention both in teaching and assessment. The reading area is no exception. One way in which an affective measure can be employed is by assessing children's attitude <b>to</b> <b>reading.</b> The literature in the area shows that attitudes <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> can have important implications for a number of aspects related <b>to</b> <b>reading.</b> This thesis examined the usefulness of attitude assessment by conducting. case studies of good and poor readers. An interview schedule was used to assess both attitudes <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> and possible causes of the attitude, and a modified miscue inventory was used <b>to</b> assess <b>reading</b> ability. The main implication to be drawn from the case studies is the importance of assessing a child's attitude <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> as well as assessing a child's reading ability. The interview provided a wealth of information about factors influencing attitude <b>to</b> <b>reading.</b> The study also indicated that important differences exist between good and poor readers in a number of areas. Together, both measures allow a teacher to look at the total picture of the factors affecting a child's reading. By using an instrument of this kind a teacher should be able to plan a remedial program more realistically than she/he could given only cognitive data. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that learning <b>to</b> <b>read</b> can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German. Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities {{that occur in the}} standard English spellings of commonly used words. Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English. Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write English.|$|E
