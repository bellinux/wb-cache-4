5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} TB {{is made by}} identifying M. tuberculosis in a clinical sample (e.g., sputum, pus, or a tissue biopsy). However, the difficult culture process for this slow-growing organism can take <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> weeks for blood or sputum culture. Thus, treatment is often begun before cultures are confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Michael Praetorius {{composed}} seven {{a cappella}} settings, for <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> voices. Dieterich Buxtehude composed two organ preludes, BuxWV 208 and BuxWV 209. Johann Sebastian Bach used the third stanza to conclude his cantata Gott soll allein mein Herze haben, BWV 169, composed in Leipzig for the 18th Sunday after Trinity and first performed on 20 October 1726.|$|E

5|$|Crested and marbled newts {{live and}} breed in vegetation-rich ponds or similar aquatic {{habitats}} for <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> months and usually {{spend the rest}} of the year in shady, protection-rich land habitats close to their breeding sites. Males court females with a ritualised display, ending in the deposition of a spermatophore that is picked up by the female. After fertilisation, a female lays 200–400 eggs, folding them individually into leaves of water plants. Larvae develop over two to four months before metamorphosing into land-dwelling juveniles.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developing}} world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children {{and thus more}} women participating in the workforce. Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control. Family planning via the use of modern birth control {{is one of the}} most cost-effective health interventions. For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> dollars are saved. These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses. While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.|$|E

5|$|Larvae hatch {{from their}} egg casing in <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> weeks. They are born carnivores, feeding instinctively on small {{invertebrates}} that move {{in their field}} of vision. Food items include small aquatic crustaceans (cladocerans, copepods and ostracods), aquatic dipterans and tadpoles. As they develop, they naturally feed upon larger prey. To increase their chances for survival, some individuals grow bigger heads and become cannibals, and feed upon their own brood mates.|$|E
5|$|San Marcos {{was used}} for gunnery {{practice}} throughout World War II, although generally as an anchor for a canvas target screen. Sitting <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> {{feet below the surface}} and marked by an unlit buoy, she was responsible for the sinking of the cargo ship Lexington in 1940 following a collision. Tons of explosives were used to demolish her upperworks and drive her hull deep into the mud; by January 1959, they were successful and she remains there today.|$|E
5|$|The amputated parts {{might be}} placed in a pouch for the girl to wear. A single hole of 2–3mm is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid. The vulva is closed with {{surgical}} thread, or agave or acacia thorns, and might be covered with a poultice of raw egg, herbs and sugar. To help the tissue bond, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle; the bindings are usually loosened after a week and removed after <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> weeks. If the remaining hole is too large {{in the view of the}} girl's family, the procedure is repeated.|$|E

5|$|The finetooth shark (Carcharhinus isodon) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, found in the western Atlantic Ocean, from North Carolina to Brazil. It forms large schools in shallow, coastal waters, and migrates {{seasonally}} following warm water. A relatively small, slender-bodied shark, the finetooth shark can be identified by its needle-like teeth, dark blue-gray dorsal coloration, and long gill slits. It attains a maximum length of 1.9m (6.2ft). The diet of this species consists primarily of small bony fishes, in particular menhaden. Like other members of its family, it is viviparous with females giving birth to <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> pups in estuarine nursery areas every other year.|$|E
5|$|Troy Kennedy Martin's {{original}} {{script for}} episode {{one and the}} final scripts for episodes <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> of the serial were published by Faber and Faber in 1990; the script book also included an introduction by Kennedy Martin and two appendices – the first giving background to the story and the main characters and the second giving comments on the script by experts on nuclear power and police procedures.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{disturbances}} {{can occur}} {{in the early stages}} of the disease and sometimes prior to diagnosis, and increase in prevalence with duration of the disease. The most common cognitive deficit in PD is executive dysfunction, which can include problems with planning, cognitive flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, inhibiting inappropriate actions, initiating appropriate actions, working memory, and control of attention. Other cognitive difficulties include slowed cognitive processing speed, impaired recall and impaired perception and estimation of time. Nevertheless, improvement appears when recall is aided by cues. Visuospatial difficulties are also part of the disease, seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines. A person with PD has <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> times the risk of dementia compared to the general population.|$|E

5|$|For {{missions}} beyond low Earth orbit (BLEO), NASA {{has been}} directed to develop the Space Launch System (SLS), a Saturn-V class rocket, and the <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> person, beyond low Earth orbit spacecraft, Orion. In February 2010, President Barack Obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds for the Constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the ISS to private companies. During {{a speech at the}} Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010, Obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) to replace the formerly planned Ares V. In his speech, Obama called for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025, and a manned mission to Mars orbit by the mid-2030s. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 was passed by Congress and signed into law on October 11, 2010. The act officially canceled the Constellation program.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, the NY Waterway-operated East River Ferry line started operations. The {{route is}} a 7-stop East River service that {{runs in a}} loop between East 34th Street and Hunters Point, making two {{intermediate}} stops in Brooklyn and three in Queens. The ferry, {{an alternative to the}} New York City Subway, cost $4 per one-way ticket. It was instantly popular, with <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> times the number of passengers that the city predicted would ride the ferries. From June to November 2011, the ferry accommodated 2,862 riders on an average weekday, as opposed to a projection of 1,488 riders, and it had 4,500 riders on an average weekend, six times the city's projected ridership; in total, the ferry saw 350,000 riders in that period, over 250% of the initial ridership forecast of 134,000 riders.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them to travel on White Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E
50|$|On May 4, 1795, 57 {{slaves and}} three local white men {{were put on}} trial in Point Coupee.

5|$|Lice {{are divided}} into two groups: sucking lice, which obtain their {{nourishment}} from feeding on the sebaceous secretions and body fluids of their host; and chewing lice, which are scavengers, feeding on skin, fragments of feathers or hair, and debris found on the host's body. Most are found on only specific types of animals, and, in some cases, on only a particular part of the body; some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> for birds. For example, in humans, different species of louse inhabit the scalp and pubic hair. Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host. Some species of chewing lice house symbiotic bacteria in bacteriocytes in their bodies. These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them, it will die. If their host dies, lice can opportunistically use phoresis to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt {{to find a new}} host.|$|E
5|$|On May16, the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) {{issued a}} {{forecast}} of a slightly below-average season. It predicted 10 named storms with a 70% {{chance that the}} number would be between 7 and 13 and 6 hurricanes with a 70% chance that the number would be between 3 and 9. It also predicted an ACE index of 84 with a 70% chance that the index {{would be in the}} range 47 to 121. NOAA released their pre-season forecasts on May22 and called for a 70% chance that there would be between 8 and 13 named storms, 3 to 6 hurricanes, and 1 to 2 major hurricanes. On May 29, the Florida State University Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies, FSU COAPS, issued its first and only prediction for the season. The organization called for five to nine named storms, of which <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> would further intensify into hurricanes; one to two of the hurricanes would reach major hurricane intensity. In addition, an ACE index of 60units was forecast.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} paired {{cerebral}} organs, sacs whose only openings {{are to the}} outside. Others species have unpaired evertible organs {{on the front of}} their heads. Some have slits {{along the side of the}} head or grooves obliquely across the head, and these may be associated with paired cerebral organs. All of these are thought to be chemoreceptors, and the cerebral organs may also aiding osmoregulation. Small pits in the epidermis appear to be sensors. On their head some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli, which can detect light but not form an image. Most nemerteans have <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> ocelli, although some have hundreds. A few tiny species that live between grains of sand have statocysts, which sense balance.|$|E
