5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time {{to care for the}} nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> <b>the</b> eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|Before loading, {{the cannon}} would be cleaned {{with a wet}} sponge to {{extinguish}} any smouldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by wadding of paper or hay, and the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming, the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> <b>the</b> pieces every ten or twelve rounds.|$|E
5|$|For {{creating}} the steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity, and for cooling the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling water that {{is used in the}} Lynemouth power station is taken from a body of water located close to the plant, the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> <b>the</b> heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The cooling water is then transferred back to the North Sea.|$|E

If too much substance is used, the bead will become dark and opaque. The bead and adhering substance is then heated in the lower, reducing, part of <b>the</b> flame, allowed <b>to</b> <b>cool,</b> and <b>the</b> colour observed. It is then heated in the upper, oxidizing, part of <b>the</b> flame, allowed <b>to</b> <b>cool,</b> and <b>the</b> colour observed again.|$|R

5|$|Natural ice {{was put to}} many uses. The ice trade enabled its {{widespread}} use in medicine in attempts to treat diseases and to alleviate their symptoms, as well as making tropical hospitals more bearable. In Calcutta, for example, part of each ice shipment was specially reserved in the city's ice house {{for the use of}} the local doctors. By the middle of the 19th century, the British Royal Navy was using imported ice <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> <b>the</b> interiors of its ships' gun turrets. In 1864, and after several attempts, salmon eggs were finally shipped successfully from Britain to Australia, using natural ice to keep them chilled on route, enabling the creation of the Tasmanian salmon fishery industry.|$|E
5|$|The second chapter, Metamorphosis, {{focuses on}} the {{evolutionary}} origins of humans around 5 million years ago in equatorial Africa. Wade suggests that the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees lived in forests. Some of them, due to a global climate change between 5 and 10 million years ago, left the shrinking forests and moved to open woodland, and this new ecological niche {{gave rise to the}} human lineage. A change in food availability led to an adaptation for the ability to eat meat, and this nutrition facilitated the evolution of a larger brain. The knuckle-walking of the common ancestor gave way to bipedalism, which is more efficient over longer distances. A larger brain in combination with freed-up hands culminated in the evolution of Homo habilis and the first use of tools around 2.5 million years ago, and the more humanlike and larger brained Homo ergaster about 1.7 million years ago. The adaptations of H.ergaster to hot, dry climates included an external nose to condense air and minimise water loss, and the loss of body hair to allow sweating <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> <b>the</b> body and larger brain. Wade writes that a mutation in the melanocortin receptor gene created an advantageous darkening of the pale, hairless skin. The close descendants of H.ergaster, Homo erectus and Homo heidelbergensis, migrated out of Africa and to Asia (around 1 to 1.66 million years ago) and Europe (around 500,000 years ago), respectively. In Europe, the glacial conditions around 300,000 to 400,000 years ago pressured H.heidelbergensis to evolve into Neanderthals.|$|E
25|$|At 20:05 JST on 14 March, the Japanese {{government}} ordered seawater to be {{injected into}} Unit 2 {{in a new}} effort <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> <b>the</b> reactor core.

25|$|After {{the loss}} of site power and reactor shutdown, Unit 1 was {{initially}} cooled using the isolation condenser system. About 10minutes after the earthquake, TEPCO operators removed both of Unit 1's isolation condensers from service, and instead chose to activate the HPCI (High Pressure Coolant Injection) systems <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> <b>the</b> reactor and the core spray system was activated at 15:07 <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> <b>the</b> suppression pool. The core spray system was disabled with AC power loss at 15:37 (The tsunami) and the HPCI system failed following DC (i.e., battery back up) power loss.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{question}} remains why birds despite having very high core body temperatures have internal testes and did not evolve external testes.
