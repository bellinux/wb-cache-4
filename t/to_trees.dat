5|$|Older trees {{sometimes}} grow epicormic shoots {{directly from}} their trunks after storm or ﬁre damage. Aerial rhizomes {{can also be}} produced from the trunk if it sustains damage or has become hollow, and grow down into the soil to regenerate the plant. Such regeneration can lead <b>to</b> <b>trees</b> of great age with multiple trunks.|$|E
5|$|Sam Brown and W. D. Hamilton and Marco Archetti {{proposed}} that autumn leaf colour is {{a signal from}} trees to aphids and other pest species that migrate in autumn to the trees. In their theory, bright autumn coloration with pinks and yellows is costly <b>to</b> <b>trees</b> because pigments require energy to synthesize, but the investment may help them to reduce their parasite load.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{then moved}} into Tennessee and {{continued}} south of Huntland. Isolated and minor EF0 to EF1 damage was noted {{through most of}} its path in Tennessee. Widespread damage <b>to</b> <b>trees</b> and outbuildings occurred in this area. The worst damage, however, was to a cinder block utility building and was rated lower-end EF3. Most of its roof was removed, with over half of its downwind wall pushed outward. The tornado eventually dissipated east of Huntland.|$|E

5|$|A deep low {{pressure}} system (with a pressure of 977mbar at its peak) {{moved across the}} Pacific Coast on October 15 and then crossed the Rockies during the following day and touched out some moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, major source for storm development and intensification. Not part of the main outbreak, 3 tornadoes were reported, during the overnight hours of October 16 towards October 17, across Randall County, Texas south of Amarillo on October 16 with 1 of them confirmed as a high EF1. That tornado caused damage <b>to</b> <b>trees,</b> fences, power poles, steel pipes, trailers and barns.|$|E
5|$|Although {{machinery}} {{has replaced}} horses {{in many parts}} of the world, an estimated 100million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas. This number includes around 27million working animals in Africa alone. Some land management practices such as cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with horses. In agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animals such as horses. Logging with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage <b>to</b> <b>trees</b> due to more selective logging.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though it}} had {{weakened}} to a depression when it moved inland, Cindy's effects were still significant across the final portion of its track. The day after its landfall in southeastern Louisiana, Tropical Depression Cindy reached central Alabama. There its rainbands produced heavy rainfall and eight tornadoes. Damage was mostly limited <b>to</b> <b>trees</b> and powerlines, but an F1 tornado in Macon county injured one man, destroyed an auto-repair shop, and damaged several nearby cars. About 35,000 residences in Alabama and 7,000 in both Florida and Mississippi were left without power following the storm.|$|E

When threatened or in search of prey, they will leap from a branch and splay their four webbed feet. The membranes between their toes and loose skin flaps on their sides catch the air as they fall, helping them to glide, sometimes 50 feet (15 meters) or more, <b>to</b> a neighboring <b>tree</b> branch or even {{all the way to}} the ground. They also have oversized toe pads to help them land softly and stick <b>to</b> <b>tree</b> trunks. They survive mainly on insects.

5|$|In 1997 an {{outbreak}} of respiratory disease occurred in Malaysian farmers and their pigs. More than 265 cases of encephalitis, of which 105 were fatal, were recorded. A new paramyxovirus was discovered in a victim's brain; it was named Nipah virus, after the village where he had lived. The infection {{was caused by a}} virus from fruit bats, after their colony had been disrupted by deforestation. The bats had moved <b>to</b> <b>trees</b> nearer the pig farm and the pigs caught the virus from their droppings.|$|E
5|$|The route {{continues}} north, {{serving as}} the boundary between Searingtown and Albertson as it proceeds past side streets lined by homes. At I.U. Willets Road, CR101 serves Henry Wiscardi School and enters Searingtown. Just inside of the community, CR101 intersects Hilldale Drive and Dogwood Road, two local streets connecting to Herricks Middle School. The route continues on through Searingtown into the village of North Hills, where the homes give way <b>to</b> <b>trees</b> as it turns to the northeast and passes under the Northern State Parkway. A short distance after the Northern Parkway overpass, CR101 meets the Long Island Expressway (Interstate495) by way of Nassau Boulevard—the southern service road—and North Service Road.|$|E
5|$|Turquoise parrots are {{encountered}} in pairs or small groups consisting {{of parents and}} several offspring, though they may congregate into larger flocks of up to 75 predominantly juvenile birds outside the breeding season. As the breeding season nears, pairs separate out from these flocks. Turquoise parrots roost together communally in autumn and winter. At night they roost among the foliage of trees such as gums or wattles, anywhere from 1 to 8m (3–25ft) above the ground. They retreat <b>to</b> <b>trees</b> near their feeding areas during the day. The calls of the turquoise parrot have been little-studied; birds give a high-pitched soft contact call when feeding or in flight, while the alarm call {{has been described as}} a high-pitched zitting call. Turquoise parrots also chatter when settling to roost in the evening.|$|E

40|$|Wind {{damage is}} the most serious problem among all primary biotic and abiotic damage <b>to</b> European forests. <b>Tree</b> {{uprooting}} is generally reported as the major failure mode during windstorms. However the mechanism is largely unknown. A finite element model was developed <b>to</b> describe <b>tree</b> anchorage behaviour by root system architecture explicitly represented, roots and soil material properties and root-soil interactions. A constitutive law derived from damage mechanics has been implemented to model the individual root failure behaviour. The tree uprooting process was described by sequential stiffness reduction and the overall failure of the root-soil system both driven by sequential root failure. Root responses <b>to</b> <b>tree</b> overturning were identified with respect to root classes then directly linked <b>to</b> the <b>tree</b> overall response during the process. Through a systematic evaluation of main root components in relation <b>to</b> <b>tree</b> anchorage strength, the taproot, large shallow roots and windward sinker roots are found to contribute most significantly <b>to</b> <b>tree</b> stability. An extensive sensitivity analysis based on Taguchi orthogonal array shows root system architecture play a predominant role over roots and soil material properties...|$|R
5|$|While the {{hurricane}} {{was over the}} open ocean, it produced large swells that caused the deaths of three people two in the Caribbean {{and one in the}} United States. As it passed west of Bermuda as a minimal hurricane, damage was limited primarily <b>to</b> <b>trees</b> and power lines, with roughly 27,500residences losing electricity. Total losses in the territory were less than US$500,000. However, in Newfoundland, Igor wrought extreme damage, claimed to be the worst ever seen in some areas. Large stretches of roadways were completely washed out by flooding, including a portion of the Trans-Canada Highway, isolating approximately 150communities. Throughout the region, one person was killed and damage costs amounted to a record C$200million. In the storm's wake, military personnel were deployed to assist in recovery efforts and aid distribution.|$|E
5|$|Agrilus planipennis, {{commonly}} known as the emerald ash borer, is a green buprestid or jewel beetle native to northeastern Asia that feeds on ash species. Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath the bark of ash trees to emerge as adults in one to two years. In its native range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant damage <b>to</b> <b>trees</b> native to the area. Outside its native range, it is an invasive species and is highly destructive to ash trees native to northwest Europe and North America. Prior to being found in North America, very little was known about emerald ash borer in its native range; this has resulted in much of the research on its biology being focused in North America. Local governments in North America are attempting to control it by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, insecticides, and biological control.|$|E
5|$|Barn owls are cavity nesters. They choose {{holes in}} trees, {{fissures}} in cliff faces, the large nests of other birds {{such as the}} hamerkop (Scopus umbretta) and, particularly in Europe and North America, old buildings such as farm sheds and church towers. Buildings are preferred <b>to</b> <b>trees</b> in wetter climates in the British Isles and provide better protection for fledglings from inclement weather. Trees tend to be in open habitats {{rather than in the}} middle of woodland and nest holes tend to be higher in North America than in Europe because of possible predation by raccoons (Procyon lotor). No nesting material is used as such but, as the female sits incubating the eggs, she draws in the dry furry material of which her regurgitated pellets are composed, so that by the time the chicks are hatched, they are surrounded by a carpet of shredded pellets. Oftentimes other birds such as jackdaws (Corvus monedula) nest in the same hollow tree or building and seem to live harmoniously with the owls.|$|E
