5|$|Seasonal {{rainfall}} {{patterns of}} the Western Ghats necessitate a period of dormancy for its land snails, resulting in their high abundance and diversity including at least 258 species of gastropods from 57 genera and 24 families. A total of 77 species of freshwater molluscs (52 gastropods and 25 bivalves) have been recorded from the Western Ghats, but the actual number is likely higher. This include 28 endemics. Among the threatened freshwater molluscs are <b>the</b> <b>mussels</b> Pseudomulleria dalyi, which is a Gondwanan relict, and the snail Cremnoconchus, which is restricted to the spray zone of waterfalls. According to the IUCN, 4 species of freshwater molluscs are considered endangered and 3 are vulnerable. An additional 19 species are considered data deficient.|$|E
25|$|Bouchot culture: Intertidal growth technique, or bouchot technique: pilings, {{known in}} French as bouchots, are planted at sea; ropes, on which <b>the</b> <b>mussels</b> grow, are {{tied in a}} spiral on the pilings; some mesh netting {{prevents}} <b>the</b> <b>mussels</b> from falling away. This method needs an extended tidal zone.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the start}} of the cartoon, Mickey is seen {{whistling}} to the tune of the song [...] "The Simple Things," [...] Pluto sniffing behind him, spots a mussel as he tries to cover up miniature geysers along <b>the</b> way. <b>The</b> <b>mussel</b> then squirts water at him. Pluto barks at <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> and <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> barks back. <b>The</b> <b>mussel</b> gets trapped on Pluto`s tail after they fight. He pulls <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> up and attempts to shove it off his tail but instead he pulls <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> up and down like a yo-yo. <b>The</b> <b>mussel</b> accidentally gets stuck in his mouth. Pluto then rushes to Mickey for assistance. At first Mickey thinks that Pluto is asking for food and feeds him a hot dog. <b>The</b> <b>mussel</b> then steals Mickey's sandwich and a full pepper shaker which causes <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> to sneeze thus freeing itself from Pluto's mouth. <b>The</b> <b>mussel</b> bounces around sneezing and wakes up a seagull that decides to eat <b>the</b> <b>mussel.</b> <b>The</b> sneezing <b>mussel</b> escapes <b>the</b> seagull by entering the sea. The hungry seagull steals the hot dog that Mickey is feeding Pluto instead. The seagull then sets his sights on the fish bait Mickey is using and unsuccessfully attempts to steal the fish while the line is being cast. Dejected but determined, the seagull then sits on top of Mickey's hat and easily steals the fish as he is baiting the hook until Mickey shoos the seagull away. He then floats under the hat to the other bait bucket and again eats the fish until Pluto notices and shoos him away and the seagull by tying up Pluto using his own tail and ears. Mickey again catches the seagull in his bait and after the bird tries to fly away carrying the bait, Mickey throws a rock in it which weighs it down. To overcome this, the seagull spells out [...] "FREE FRESH FISH" [...] using flag semaphore to get the other seagulls to chase Mickey and Pluto away. The short ends with the seagull floating away with fish in his mouth singing the song [...] "The Simple Things".|$|R

25|$|Zebra and quagga mussels can be {{destructive}} to an ecosystem due to competition for resources with native species. The filtration of zooplankton by <b>the</b> <b>mussels</b> can negatively impact the feeding for some species of fish.

25|$|Marine mussels {{are usually}} found {{clumping}} together on wave-washed rocks, each {{attached to the}} rock by its byssus. The clumping habit helps hold <b>the</b> <b>mussels</b> firm against {{the force of the}} waves.

40|$|Macrofaunal assemblages with {{prevalence}} of Bresiliidae shrimps and Mytilidae mussels are abundant in at hydrothermal vents along <b>the</b> Mid-Atlantic Ridge. <b>Mussels</b> inhabit zones of diffuse seeps of hydrothermal fluids with temperature abnormalities {{up to several}} degrees. Shrimps inhabit an extreme biotope in a mixed interface between seawater and hydrothermal fluids at temperature up to 20 - 30 °C. We studied <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> and shrimp assemblages in three hydrothermal vent fields: Rainbow, Broken Spur, and Snake Pit. Species richness of <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> assemblages within at least two fields (Broken Spur and Snake Pit) is higher as compared with shrimps from the same hydrothermal vent fields. Fauna inhibiting shrimp swarms lack almost any taxa specific for particular assemblages: almost all the taxa are also present in <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> beds. Structure of the shrimp assemblage is less homogeneous as {{compared with that of}} <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> assemblage. Population {{prevalence of}} one taxon (Copepoda) in the shrimp assemblage is most likely connected with extreme and unstable conditions of the biotope occupied by the shrimps in a hydrothermal field.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>mussels</b> were {{initially}} {{brought to the}} United States through the ballast water of ships entering the Great Lakes. These aquatic invaders soon spread to many bodies {{of water in the}} Eastern United States and have even {{made their way to the}} western United States. In January 2008, Zebra mussels have been detected in several reservoirs along the Colorado River system such as Lakes Mead, Mojave, and Havasu.|$|E
25|$|Introductions {{into the}} Great Lakes include the zebra mussel, which was first {{discovered}} in 1988, and quagga mussel in 1989. The mollusks are efficient filter feeders, competing with native mussels and reducing available food and spawning grounds for fish. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>mussels</b> {{may be a}} nuisance to industries by clogging pipes. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that {{the economic impact of}} the zebra mussel could be about $5billion over the next decade.|$|E
5000|$|The fish spawns in clear, slow-running {{or still}} water, {{often with a}} muddy bottom.

50|$|Until the 1990s phototrophic endoliths {{were thought}} as {{somewhat}} benign {{but since then}} evidence has surfaced that phototrophic endoliths (primarily cyanobacteria) have infested 50 to 80% of midshore populations of <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> species Perna perna located in South Africa.The infestation of Phototrophic endoliths resulted in lethal and sub-lethal effects such as the decrease in strength of <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> shells. Although <b>the</b> rate of thickening of the shells were faster in more infested areas it is not rapid enough to combat the degradation of <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> shells.|$|R
25|$|In September/October 1997, {{as few as}} 10-12 AZA-contaminated mussels were {{consumed}} by individuals in the Arranmore Island region of Donegal, Ireland. At least 20-24 people were {{believed to have been}} exposed to AZAs in this event, but only eight sought medical attention. Symptoms included nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for 2–5 days prior to full recovery. Analysis of the shellfish revealed five AZA analogues, AZA1-5, with most of the toxin concentrated in the digestive glands at levels exceeding 30 μg/g (estimated at 6 μg/g whole mussel meat). The AZAs persisted in <b>the</b> <b>mussels</b> at elevated levels for at least eight months.|$|E
25|$|Although mussels {{are valued}} as food, mussel {{poisoning}} due to toxic planktonic organisms {{can be a}} danger along some coastlines. For instance, mussels should be avoided along {{the west coast of}} the United States during the warmer months. This poisoning is usually due to a bloom of dinoflagellates (red tides), which contain toxins. The dinoflagellates and their toxin are harmless to mussels, even when concentrated by the mussel's filter feeding, but if <b>the</b> <b>mussels</b> are consumed by humans, the concentrated toxins cause serious illness, such as paralytic shellfish poisoning. A person affected in this way after eating mussels is said to be musselled.|$|E
25|$|Facilitation affects {{community}} diversity (defined in {{this context}} {{as the number of}} species in the community) by altering competitive interactions. For example, intertidal mussels increase total community species diversity by displacing competitive large sessile species such as seaweed and barnacles. Although <b>the</b> <b>mussels</b> decrease diversity of primary space holders (i.e., large sessile species), a larger number of invertebrate species are associated with mussel beds than with other primary space holders, so total species diversity is higher when mussels are present. The effect of facilitation on diversity could also be reversed, if the facilitation creates a competitive dominance that excludes more species than it permits.|$|E
50|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} coast ecology and coast geology. In the 1930 there have been oyster reefs below <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> banks at <b>the</b> water level.

40|$|In situ {{measurements}} {{were carried out}} on an intertidal <b>mussel</b> bed in <b>the</b> Oosterschelde estuary, SW Netherlands. Exchange of suspended particulate matter and phytoplankton between the water column and <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> bed was measured with a Benthic Ecosystem Tunnel. In situ clearance rates of <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> bed were compared to clearance rates of individual mussels measured in a field station under ambient conditions. Concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and particulate organic carbon (POC) {{in the water column}} above the tidal flat were affected by wind-induced resuspension. Chlorophyll a concentrations were higher during flood tides than during ebb tides, and were not affected by wind-induced resuspension. Clearance rates of <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> bed ranged from 1. 3 to 7. 1 m(3) m(- 2) h(- 1). In situ measured clearance rates generally were comparable to rates observed in measurements with individual mussels in a field station. Uptake of SPM and POC by <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> bed was highly variable. Under calm weather conditions, uptake rates were correlated with inflow concentrations. Net uptake of phytoplankton was relatively higher than the uptake of POC, indicating that {{a major part of the}} POC was resuspended and exported from <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> bed after filtration. In addition, wind stress induced considerable resuspension and export of SPM and POC from <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> bed. Chlorophyll a uptake was less influenced by wind, and high rates of uptake, caused by mussel filtration, were observed. The result of filtration and resuspension processes was a net uptake by <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> bed of particulate matter containing a relatively high proportion of phytoplankton: <b>the</b> <b>mussel</b> bed acted as a selective filter for phytoplankton.
