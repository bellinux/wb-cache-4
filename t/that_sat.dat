5|$|In 1935 Tange {{began the}} {{tertiary}} studies he desired at University of Tokyo's architecture department. He studied under Hideto Kishida and Shozo Uchida. Although Tange {{was fascinated by}} the photographs of Katsura villa <b>that</b> <b>sat</b> on Kishida's desk, his work was inspired by Le Corbusier. His graduation project was a seventeen-hectare (42-acre) development set in Tokyo's Hibiya Park.|$|E

The company commissioned photographer Will Pearson to capture ten different locations including Tower Bridge, Oxford Circus, the British Museum, St Paul's Cathedral and Nelson's Column using a 360° miniature camera <b>that</b> <b>sat</b> centimeters off of the ground.|$|E
5|$|To {{accommodate}} {{members who}} had moved away from Jackson's downtown, in 1940 the congregation commenced {{construction of a new}} building on Woodrow Wilson Drive, while holding services at Galloway Memorial Methodist Church. The congregation moved into the new building in 1941, and dedicated it in January 1942. The sanctuary had solid walnut pews <b>that</b> <b>sat</b> 300. At the time of the move, Beth Israel's old building at South State and South was the oldest building used for religious purposes in Jackson.|$|E

On September 14, 2004, the $13 million Hydra the Revenge was announced. Construction began {{in the spring of}} 2004 and continued through the winter. Hydra the Revenge was topped off (highest piece of the lift hill) on August 20, 2004 and the entire track layout was completed on December 4, 2004. The first cars for the coaster arrived at Dorney Park on December 10, 2004 and the first ride with people on a train took place on March 24, 2005. The roller coaster officially opened to the public on May 7, 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians also {{interacted with}} deities through the {{donation}} of offerings, ranging from simple bits of jewelry to large and finely carved statues and stelae. Among their contributions were statues <b>that</b> <b>sat</b> in temple courts, serving as memorials to the donors after their deaths and receiving {{portions of the}} temple offerings to sustain the donors' spirits. Other statues served as gifts to the temple god, and inscribed stelae conveyed to the resident deity the donors' prayers and messages of thanks. Over the centuries, {{so many of these}} statues accumulated within a temple building that priests sometimes moved them out of the way by burying them in caches beneath the floor. Commoners offered simple wooden or clay models as votives. The form of these models may indicate the reason for their donation. Figurines of women are among the most common types of votive figures, and some are inscribed with a prayer for a woman to bear a child.|$|E
5|$|The site of One Meridian Plaza {{was bought}} by the Arden Group in 2000. The site was {{converted}} into a parking lot as construction on a new building was held up in a zoning feud with the neighboring site, 1441 Chestnut Street. 1441 Chestnut Street {{was the site of}} the Morris Building and other smaller buildings <b>that</b> <b>sat</b> behind One Meridian Plaza. The feud between Arden Group's chief executive Craig Spencer and 1441 Chestnut Street developer Tim Mahoney began in 2003. Spencer and Mahoney settled their dispute in March 2006 and construction on One Meridian's 48-story replacement, the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton began in May. The Residences at The Ritz-Carlton opened in January 2009. A memorial was unveiled on October 21, 2009 at the skyscraper honoring the three firefighters who died in the fire. The memorial features three bronze firefighter helmets atop a marble base with the firefighters' names on it. It sits in an empty area between the condo building and the adjacent hotel along the south side of South Penn Square across from the SW corner of Dilworth Park.|$|E

The end of the carriage rested on rollers which rested on a metal track or rail. For transport the K 39 broke down into three loads, the barrel, the carriage and the firing platform with the turntable. Each of these was carried on a trailer with pneumatic tires. Emplacing the gun took six to eight hours, mainly to dig in and anchor the firing platform.|$|E

Paintings showing exercises in abstraction and geometric {{patterns in the}} style of Frank Stella are seen in paintings like Suzy (1968) and color theory works such as Yellow Over Green and Yellow Over Red (1969), the latter two which have since been destroyed. Working in clay, Lowe created egg-shaped sculptures <b>that</b> <b>sat</b> on coiled stands, Collection of Eggs and Unmatched Halves (c. 1968), giving a fantasy yet comic feel to his early experiments in art.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>SAT</b> scores systematically underestimate future performance of minority students.

Some studies have also shown that African American students under-perform in college relative to their white peers with the same SAT scores; researchers have argued that this is likely because white students tend to benefit from social advantages outside of the educational environment (for example, high parental involvement in their education, inclusion in campus academic activities, positive bias from same-race teachers and peers) which result in better grades.|$|E
25|$|An {{advance on}} the basic design was the iron ploughshare, a {{replaceable}} horizontal cutting surface mounted {{on the tip of}} the share. The earliest ploughs with a detachable and replaceable share date from around 1000 BC in the Ancient Near East, and the earliest iron ploughshares from ca. 500 BC in China. Early mouldboards were basically wedges <b>that</b> <b>sat</b> inside the cut formed by the coulter, turning over the soil to the side. The ploughshare spread the cut horizontally below the surface, so when the mouldboard lifted it, a wider area of soil was turned over. Mouldboards are known in Britain from the late 6th century on.|$|E

For {{the rest of the}} night and throughout the next day, local IRA units fought gun battles with both the UVF and British Army.
