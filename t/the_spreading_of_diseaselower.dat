40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>The</b> notion <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> {{a matrix}} was first {{introduced}} fifty years ago in algebra. In this article, we define <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shape operator by applying the same idea to submanifolds of Riemannian manifolds. We prove that <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> shape operator is a conformal invariant for any submanifold in a Riemannian manifold. Then, we prove that, for a compact submanifold of a Riemannian manifold, <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shape operator is bounded above by a geometric quantity proportional to the Willmore-Chen functional. For a complete non-compact submanifold, we establish a relationship between <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shape operator and the Willmore-Chen functional. In the last section, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a surface of rotation to have finite integral <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shape operator...|$|R

Many correlative and experimental studies have focused on different aspects of C. cylindracea invasion. This paper aims to evaluate the main factors influencing <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> this alga through an overview of the results from 47 published papers on this topic; a conceptual model synthesizing the main biotic and abiotic factors that influence C. cylindracea spread was proposed. Mechanical destruction of habitats, enhanced sedimentation rate and nutrients loading directly promote <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> C. cylindracea. Indirect effects due to factors that foster <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> turf-forming algae at the expense of canopy-forming species and decrease substrate complexity emerged as an important determinant of the success of C. cylindracea. Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> C. cylindracea appears to be regulated by a complex net of interactions between abiotic and biotic factors.
