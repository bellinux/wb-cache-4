40|$|E-Commerce is {{expected}} {{to play a major}} role in the 21 st century global market. Of the various E-commerce models (B 2 B, B 2 C, B 2 E and B 2 G), B 2 B has been particularly successful, due to adoption of standardized processes for document exchange (like EDI), shipping, <b>tracking,</b> <b>delivery</b> and payment among supply chain partners. One element of B 2 B is E-procurement. E-procurement focuses on acquisition of resources, especially MRO items, and increasingly materials and components. Some analysts believe that enormous cost savings and increased effectiveness can be achieved through the utilization of E-procurement. E-procurement utilizes electronic purchase procedures implemented through Internet communication and Web based buying tools. Studies in the literature report on the adoption of E-procurement in different countries and industries. This study focuses on the current status of E-procurement in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) located in the Southcoast of Massachusetts. The main objective of this research is to understand the current state of E-procurement in SMEs and to examine those things that influence E-procurement adoption. A questionnaire-based survey was employed for data collection. A conceptual model was developed to describe/explain the adoption of E-procurement and a framework is proposed for the successful adoption of E-procurement on the Southcoast of Massachusetts.

40|$|Introduction: This study {{assessed}} complex, target-tracking, intensity- modulated delivery by the Elekta MLCi system. For treatment {{sites where}} intrafraction tissue motion {{is a significant}} problem, target-tracking deliveries have the potential of reducing motion margins used in radiotherapy planning. Method: A toroidally shaped target surrounding an organ at risk (OAR), necessitating multiple field segments to irradiate the target and spare the OAR, was defined in a solid water phantom. The phantom was programmed to move in a reproducible 2 D elliptical trajectory. A static and target-tracking delivery were planned for delivery on a standard Elekta Precise series linac with integrated MLCi system. Dose was delivered in 3 ways: (i) static delivery to the static phantom, (ii) static delivery to the moving phantom and (iii) <b>tracking</b> <b>delivery</b> to a moving phantom, and was assessed by film measurement. The dose delivery was quantified by measurement of the {{mean and standard deviation}} of the dose on the central plane through the target. Results: The mean target doses measured were: 100 % 2. 8 %, 95. 8 % 7. 2 % and 98. 5 % 2. 6 %, respectively, for the three cases listed above, whereas the mean doses to the OAR from the three delivery scenarios were: 38. 2 % 24. 4 %, 54. 0 % 18. 1 % and 38. 2 % 19. 7 %. All dose measurements are quoted relative to the static target dose from a static delivery. Conclusion: Target-tracking deliveries {{have been shown to be}} realisable on the current generation of Elekta linacs. The tracking techniques have been shown to remove the negative effects of tissue motion. In this case, reducing the mean dose to the OAR by 15. 8 % whilst restoring the target dose homogeneity to the static case. However, many obstacles remain before the technique can be safely used in the clinic and these are the subject of further research in the field...|$|E
40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Radiotherapy is one of the main {{treatment}} modalities of lung cancer. However, the achievable accuracy of radiotherapy treatment is limited for lung-based tumors due to respiratory motion. Four-dimensional radiotherapy explicitly accounts for anatomic motion by characterizing the motion, creating a treatment plan that accounts for this motion, and delivering this plan to the moving anatomy. This thesis focuses on the current problems and solutions throughout the course of four-dimensional radiotherapy. For characterization of respiratory-induced motion, patient tumor motion data were analyzed. It is shown that tumor motion can be significant during radiotherapy treatment, and its extent, direction, and linearity vary considerably between patients, between treatment fractions, and between respiratory cycles. After this, approaches to four-dimensional intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning were developed and investigated. Among the techniques to manage respiratory motion, tumor tracking using a dynamic multileaf collimator delivery technique was chosen as a promising method. A formalism to solve a general four-dimensional intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment-planning problem was developed. Specific solutions to this problem accounting for tumor motion initially in one dimension and extending this to three dimensions were developed and investigated using four-dimensional computed tomography planning scans of lung cancer patients. For four-dimensional radiotherapy treatment delivery, accuracy of two-dimensional projection imaging methods was investigated. Geometric uncertainty due to the limitation of two-dimensional imaging in monitoring three-dimensional tumor motion during treatment delivery was quantified. This geometric uncertainty can be used to estimate proper margins when a single two-dimensional projection imager is used for four-dimensional treatment delivery. Lastly, tumor-tracking delivery using a moving average algorithm was investigated as an alternative delivery technique that reduces mechanical motion constraints of a multileaf collimator. Moving average tracking provides an approximate solution that can be immediately implemented for delivery of four-dimensional intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment. The clinical implementation of four-dimensional guidance, intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning, and dynamic multileaf collimator <b>tracking</b> <b>delivery</b> may have a positive impact on the treatment of lung cancer...|$|E
40|$|Marketing is an {{area that}} aims at {{satisfying}} the desires and needs of consumers or groups of consumers (segments marketing), and guaranteeing commercialization of goods and services proposed in optimal conditions of profit. Marketing is thus a set of methods and means at the organization's disposal to promote behaviors, in its target audiences, in favor of the achievement of its own objectives. Marketing therefore aims at forecasting, detecting, causing, altering or stimulating consumers' needs and continuously adapting the production facilities and the commercial structures to the diagnosed needs. We focus our study on marketing activities in e-commerce because the marketing unit of e-commerce has a particularly large source of information at its disposal: hundreds of e-consumers criticisms and evaluations that are continuously gathered and updated through the web facilities. From these criticisms, relevant tendency indicators for marketing analysis could be computed. Indeed, nowadays thousands of people are turning to computational Recommender Systems (RS) before making an e-purchase. RS aim to mediate, support, or automate the everyday process of sharing recommendations between cyberconsumers' communities. They allow them to criticize and evaluate e-retailers according to different criteria such as Range of Services/Products, Product & Service Pricing, Purchase <b>Tracking,</b> <b>Delivery</b> Time, Security of Payment [...] . These so partitioned evaluations databases constitute a gold mine for the marketing unit of an e-commerce. The marketing activity can thus be modelled as a multi criteria analysis of these databases. Furthermore, this analysis must be performed within an uncertain framework due to the dispersion of the opinions of the e-customers. We address these issues with non linear multi criteria aggregation techniques based on the Choquet integral to take interactions between criteria into account and possibility distributions to represent the opinions' dispersion. The global evaluation of an e-commerce is thus perceived as a fuzzy number that results from the aggregation of the partial distributions associated to the evaluation criteria. The marginal contribution of a criterion to the global evaluation of an e-retailer is a basic and useful notion to marketing activities. Indeed, the marketing unit of an e commerce can thus estimate the impact or influence of each dimension of the activity of the e commerce in real time, determine the criteria on which the e-commerce activity should be improved first in order to improve its overall rating as much as possible. Moreover, this principle can be extended to the relative comparison with other competing eretailers. The case of multi modal distributions of e-consumers' evaluations is finally tackled. This principle can easily be transposed in any manufacturing facility to elaborate diagnosis and improvement indexes for a multi-criteria industrial performance synthesized by a Choquet integral aggregation...|$|E

40|$|Produced {{to improve}} {{services}} {{for families and}} carers, this guidance is for {{those involved in the}} planning, commissioning and delivery of services for families and carers, and drug treatment services. The document covers commissioning themes, developing services specific to families and carers, and involving families and carers in drug users’ treatment. This guidance is relevant for all those involved in the planning, commissioning or delivery of services specifically for families and carers, and drug treatment services. Having a relative or friend who is a drug misuser is an extremely stressful experience, which can affect individuals’ physical health and psychological wellbeing, finances, social lives, and relationships with others. These impacts often mean that families, kinship carers and other carers need help in their own right, to enable them to cope better with what are usually on-going, long-term issues. Not only is it important to help family members, kinship carers and other carers deal with these challenges for their own wellbeing, but appropriately including family members and carers in the treatment process often allows them to better support drug users. There is a good deal of evidence that suggests supporting and involving family members and carers effectively can lead to improved outcomes for family members and carers, as well as drug users themselves – this is summarised at www. nta. nhs. uk/familycarer. Effectively involving family members, kinship carers and other carers helps users increase their chances of: • Entering treatment • Reducing or stopping their drug misuse • Engaging with treatment if they do enter • Being retained in treatment • Successfully concluding treatment. Drug users are also less likely to suffer major relapses. This leads to better quality of service provision overall. Effective support for family members and carers in their own right, and involvement of families and carers in drug users treatment can be achieved by: • Commissioning consistent, effective and quality services for family members and carers who are affected by someone else’s drug use, either through generic mainstream carer services or through specialist substance misuse family member and carer services • Ensuring services that treat drug users involve family members and carers in their treatment, as far as this is possible and appropriate • Involving family members and carers effectively in the planning and commissioning of drug treatment, and family and carer services • Embedding effective monitoring systems and practices relating to work with family members and carers within commissioned services • Local commissioners <b>tracking</b> <b>delivery</b> of these services via robust delivery assurance system...|$|E
