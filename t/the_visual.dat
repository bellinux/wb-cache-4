5|$|Even {{before the}} advent of printing, <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> {{appearance}} of poetry often added meaning or depth. Acrostic poems conveyed meanings in the initial letters of lines or in letters at other specific places in a poem. In Arabic, Hebrew and Chinese poetry, <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> presentation of finely calligraphed poems has played an important part in the overall effect of many poems.|$|E

50|$|It {{also should}} be noted that <b>the</b> <b>visuals</b> do not {{constitute}} true hallucinations in the clinical sense of the word; people with HPPD recognize <b>the</b> <b>visuals</b> to be illusory, or pseudohallucinations, and thus maintain the ability to determine what is real (in contrast to some mental illnesses such as schizophrenia).|$|R
50|$|In {{another type}} of task, {{participants}} are first presented with a target stimulus, and later presented with two different <b>visuals.</b> One of <b>the</b> <b>visuals</b> matches <b>the</b> target stimulus on the global level, while <b>the</b> other <b>visual</b> matches <b>the</b> target stimulus on the local level. In this condition, experimenters note which of <b>the</b> two <b>visuals,</b> <b>the</b> global or local, is chosen to match the target stimulus.|$|R

The Math/Science/Technology program and the Youth Performing Arts School have achieved national recognition on multiple occasions.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{encryption}} algorithm {{present in the}} Agrippa binary; consequently, <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> encryption effect that displays when the poem has finished is a ruse. <b>The</b> <b>visual</b> effect {{is the result of}} running the decrypted ciphertext (in memory) through the re-purposed bit-scrambling decryption algorithm, and then abandoning the text in memory. Only the fake genetic code is written back to disk.|$|E
5|$|Vision is {{generated}} by light that hits the retina of the eye. Photoreceptors in the retina transduce the sensory stimulus of light into an electrical nerve signal that is sent to <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> cortex in the occipital lobe. Vision from the left visual field is received {{on the right side}} of each retina (and vice versa) and passes through the optic nerve until some information changes sides, so that all information about one side of <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> field passes through tracts in the opposite side of the brain. The nerves reach the brain at the lateral geniculate nucleus, and travel through the optic radiation to reach <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> cortex.|$|E

5|$|Damage to {{the optic}} nerve (II) affects {{specific}} aspects of vision that depend on {{the location of the}} lesion. A person {{may not be able to}} see objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> field, or by examining the retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> pathways.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>visuals</b> and {{presentation}} {{were the most}} praised aspects of the game. Chris Scullion of the Official Nintendo Magazine asserted that the graphics pushes the Wii to its full potential, and stated that its visual effects and large playing areas would constantly astound the player. Jeremy Parish from 1UP.com noted that despite the Wii's limitations, <b>the</b> <b>visuals</b> were [...] "absolutely impressive", especially when modified at a higher resolution. Computer and Video Gamess Andrew Robinson opined that Nintendo favoured gameplay over graphics, but thought Super Mario Galaxy [...] "got both perfect". Margaret Robertson of Eurogamer called <b>the</b> <b>visuals</b> an [...] "explosion of inventiveness", stating that the game's detail is only matched by its mission design ingenuity. [...] Andrew Reiner of Game Informer approved of the game's portrayal of water and particle effects, but noted <b>the</b> <b>visuals</b> were in similar detail to Super Mario Sunshine. Patrick Shaw from GamePro opined that the game takes {{full advantage of the}} Wii's capabilities, both in terms of presentation and control schemes.|$|R

5|$|Impressed {{with the}} film's script, V. Srinivas Mohan became <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> effects {{supervisor}} in December2007. He asked Shankar {{to increase the}} filming schedules by six months to include pre-production requirements. Both Mohan and Shankar visited several visual effects companies, including the New Zealand-based Weta Digital and the United States-based Industrial Light & Magic, Cafe FX and Tippett Studio before partnering with Legacy Effects. The original Eros-Ayngaran visual effects budget was 700million, but after Sun Pictures took over production, it was significantly reduced to 200million. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> effects team had to omit and alter some sequences, making Chitti wear sunglasses {{for most of the}} film to reduce the cost and difficultly of animating his eyes.|$|E

Specifically, <b>the</b> left optic tract corresponds to <b>the</b> right <b>visual</b> field, while <b>the</b> right optic tract corresponds to <b>the</b> left <b>visual</b> field. To form <b>the</b> right <b>visual</b> field, temporal retinal fibers from the left eye and nasal retinal fibers from the right eye form the left optic tract, and to form <b>the</b> left <b>visual</b> field, temporal retinal fibers from the right eye and nasal retinal fibers from the left eye form the right optic tract.|$|R

The Escapist Croshaw remarked that [...] "it wobbles between basic and functional to just plain bad".

[...] Sheridan stated that the graphics helped immerse him in the overall experience, giving particular praise to the lighting effects, but that <b>the</b> overall <b>visuals</b> weren't as impressive as Infinity Blade. Schilling praised the [...] "gorgeous skyboxes", but criticized some occasional poor texture work. By contrast, Reed described <b>the</b> <b>visuals</b> as nothing more than serviceable, stating that Epic Citadel looked much better. Campbell noted that the textures looked [...] "strangely low resolution", and recommended playing the game on an iPhone 4 in order to make <b>the</b> <b>visuals</b> look better. Both Squires and Rich criticized the inconsistent frame rate.|$|R
