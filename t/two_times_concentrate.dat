Titanium plates grafted with TEP were immersed in a <b>two</b> <b>times</b> <b>concentrated</b> simulated body fluid (2 SBF) to investigate deposition of hydoxyapatite (HA) on the surface. A phosphate buffer solution (PBS) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) {{was used to evaluate}} adsorption of protein on the grafted titanium surface. The morphology, component and structure of samples were examined by scanning electronic microscopy, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction respectively. The concentration change of BSA in adsorption test was examined with the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra (UV). The analyses showed that TEP grafted onto the titanium surface. In 2 SBF, calcium and phosphate ions deposited spontaneously onto the grafted titanium surface and formed a HA coating with a network-like microporous structure after being immersed for 3 days. The coating consisted of HA particles with 180 - 265 nm in thickness and 72 - 85 nm in width. The diameter of the micropores was about 200 nm. The HA coating appeared better uniformity than that on the modified titanium using phosphoric acid. BSA rapidly adsorbed onto the grafted titanium surface at first half an hour and then the adsorption quantity almost kept constant. These results indicate that TEP grafting is an effective approach to modify bioactivity of titanium...|$|R
40|$|Pigment {{extracted}} from the pulp of Hylocereus polyrhizus showed a difference in colour when subjected to room temperature extraction and 100 °C extraction. The room temperature extraction yielded red-purple coloured pigments while the 100 °C extraction yielded scarlet red coloured pigments. Experiments were carried out to investigate the best water:weight ratio and optimum temperature to obtain highest pigment concentration, best extraction method and best storing condition. Best water:weight ratio was 1 : 1, best temperature observed was 100 °C, best extraction method was by using juice concentrate rather than water extraction and the best storing condition was storage in - 20 °C. Both extraction methods exhibited stable pH reading after one week of storage. Nevertheless, the best method to obtain high pigment concentration is by using juice concentrate which is at least <b>two</b> <b>times</b> more <b>concentrated</b> than samples extracted with water...|$|R

40|$|On {{the sample}} of 68 {{preschool}} boys and girls aged five to six years two models of swimming teaching realised with purpose to research their efficacity. lt was finded before that they were nonswimers. Testers deviated in two similar groups by basic motor and cognitive abilities. First model of swim teaching, signed as time deviated learning, was realised at the cloused swimming pool with 36 testers which exercised twice of week during three months. Second model of swim teaching, signed as <b>time</b> <b>concentrated</b> learning, was realised as a two-week course with 32 testers which exercised at the sea side. Two control assessment of swimming level knowledge were made during experimental process, and a final assesment was made at the and of the experiment Scaling tehnicque was used for assesing. An analysis of the obtained data resulted in the following conclusions: the both models of swim teaching were efficacity and majority of children accepted swim knovvledge. Results of <b>time</b> <b>concentrated</b> model learning were statistical significance beter then time deviated learning only in the control assesments, but the svviming level knowledge was not different in the final assment.

40|$|The current {{research}} studied the under-deposit corrosion resistance and the crevice corrosion resistance of alloy 22 in the wet/dry cyclic conditions. The alloy 22 specimens were tested under controlled drip condition. The whole test {{was divided into}} two parts. Test A was to simulate the corrosion of the pore water to the outer cylinders of the waste packages, and test B was to simulate the corrosion of the pore water in the crevice between the outer cylinders and the emplacement pallets. And the under-deposit local corrosion was observed on the deposit regions of the alloy 22 specimens after removing the deposit when MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O+Mg(NO 3) 2 · 6 H 2 O brines and 62 <b>times</b> <b>concentrated</b> unsaturated zone pore water (UZ 62 × solution) were used.
