5|$|A {{traditional}} {{game called}} kitsune-ken (fox-fist) references the kitsune's powers over human beings. The game is similar <b>to</b> <b>rock,</b> paper, scissors, {{but the three}} hand positions signify a fox, a hunter, and a village headman. The headman beats the hunter, whom he outranks; the hunter beats the fox, whom he shoots; the fox beats the headman, whom he bewitches.|$|E
5|$|The {{slopes of}} Licancabur are {{unstable}} and prone <b>to</b> <b>rock</b> falls. Some of the instability {{may be due}} to earthquakes, snow, wind or geothermal effects (resulting in thermal stress), and it frustrated a 1920s attempt by a Chuquicamata engineer to climb the mountain.|$|E
5|$|After {{the work}} {{stoppage}} at pit number six, more white miners assembled near the town. They marched <b>to</b> <b>Rock</b> Springs {{by way of}} the railroad, carrying firearms. At about 10:00a.m., the bell in the Knights of Labor meeting hall tolled, and the miners inside the building joined the already large group. There were white miners who opted to go to saloons instead of joining the gathering mob, but by 2:00p.m., the saloons and grocers were persuaded by a Union Pacific official to close.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{recording}} of Declaration, the group appeared at the 2008s Download Festival, which was held from 13 to 15 June at Donington Park, United Kingdom. During the festival, vocalist Brandan Schieppati spoke <b>to</b> <b>Rock</b> Sound TV about the group's dispute with its record label. During the conversation, Schieppati revealed that Bleeding Through has been contacted {{by a number of}} other record companies since the band went public with its Trustkill feud. In July 2008, Bleeding Through inked a European deal with German record label Nuclear Blast for the release of Declaration.|$|E
5|$|In {{selecting}} the on-disc songs, FreeStyleGames recognized that engaging guitar tracks are not strictly limited <b>to</b> <b>rock</b> music, and included other genres into the mix. According to designer Jim Norris, their selection process began with identifying songs {{that would be}} expected by players {{to be on a}} Guitar Hero title, and then determining which of those songs which they could license. Once they had obtained the license, FreeStyleGames would mark up the song for the note highways and determined how much fun these songs would be to play. Finally, they balanced the song selection in the game to give players a combination of songs they know and those they may not recognize but would be enjoyable.|$|E
5|$|In the Permian period, the Zion and Kolob {{area was}} a {{relatively}} flat basin near sea level on the western margin of the supercontinent Pangaea. Sediments from surrounding mountains added weight to the basin, keeping it at relatively the same elevation. These sediments later lithified (turned <b>to</b> <b>rock)</b> to form the Toroweap Formation, now exposed in the Grand Canyon to the south {{but not in the}} Zion and Kolob area. This formation is not exposed in the park, though it does form its basement rock.|$|E

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the riot, federal troops were deployed in Rock Springs. They escorted the surviving Chinese miners, most of whom had fled to Evanston, Wyoming, back <b>to</b> <b>Rock</b> Springs a week after the riot. Reaction came swiftly from the era's publications. In Rock Springs, the local newspaper endorsed the outcome of the riot, while in other Wyoming newspapers, support for the riot was limited to sympathy for the causes of the white miners. The massacre in Rock Springs touched off a wave of anti-Chinese violence, especially in the Puget Sound area of Washington Territory.|$|E
5|$|Noise as {{high volume}} {{is common for}} musicians from {{classical}} orchestras <b>to</b> <b>rock</b> groups as {{they are exposed to}} high decibel ranges. Although some rock musicians experience noise-induced hearing loss from their music, it is still debated as to whether classical musicians are exposed to enough high-intensity sound to cause hearing impairments. Music-induced hearing loss is still a controversial topic for hearing researchers. While some {{studies have shown that the}} risk for hearing loss increases as music exposure increases, other studies found little to no correlation between the two.|$|E
5|$|On September 9, 1885, {{one week}} after the massacre, six {{companies}} of soldiers arrived in Wyoming. Four of the six companies then escorted the Chinese back <b>to</b> <b>Rock</b> Springs. Once back in Rock Springs, the Chinese laborers found scorched tracts of land where their homes once stood. The mining company had buried only a few dead; others remained lying in the open, mangled, decomposing, and partially eaten by dogs, hogs, or other animals.|$|E

5|$|On the Olympic Peninsula the Blue Mountain unit at {{the base}} of the Crescent Formation {{includes}} sediments (including large boulders of quartz diorite) of continental origin, showing that the continent was close by; other sediments were eroded from the pre-Cenozoic rock of Vancouver Island and the northern Cascade Range. At the southern end are sediments derived from the Klamath Mountains, while sand of the overlying Tyee Formation has an isotopic composition corresponding <b>to</b> <b>rock</b> of the Idaho Batholith.|$|E
5|$|Silent Hill series {{composer}} Akira Yamaoka {{scored the}} soundtrack of Shattered Memories. It was his final {{contribution to the}} Silent Hill series before he resigned from Konami after 16 years with the company. Voice actress Mary Elizabeth McGlynn provided vocals for four musical pieces included {{in the game and}} co-directed Shattered Memories voice acting, and musician Joe Romersa wrote lyrics for three of the pieces. The game is the first in the series to make prominent use of dynamic music; a composition is introduced and subsequently retracted, based on the player's actions, in every major area of the game. Widely varying compositions, ranging from undertones <b>to</b> <b>rock</b> music, were produced for the game.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1970s, {{the city}} has seen major {{developments}} on the pop and rock scene, {{with the arrival of}} many acclaimed bands such as Kliché, Under Byen, Gnags, TV-2, Michael Learns <b>to</b> <b>Rock,</b> Nephew, Carpark North, Spleen United, VETO, Hatesphere and Illdisposed in addition to popular individual performers like Thomas Helmig, Anne Linnet and Medina. Since 2010 the music production centre of PROMUS (Produktionscentret for Rytmisk Musik) has supported the rock scene in the city along with the publicly funded ROSA (Dansk Rock Samråd), which promotes Danish rock music in general.|$|E

5|$|State Route 16 {{begins in}} Colusa County near Wilbur Springs at the {{junction}} with State Route 20. SR 16 goes south alongside Bear Creek, which enters a narrow canyon and joins with Cache Creek near the Yolo County line. SR 16 continues in the canyon, running close to the river, passing Cache Creek Canyon Regional Park, and emerging from the canyon north of Rumsey. This section is so prone <b>to</b> <b>rock</b> slides that there are permanent gates at each end.|$|E
5|$|The NY308 {{designation}} {{was assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of New York state highways. At the time, it extended from the Rhinecliff ferry landing <b>to</b> <b>Rock</b> City in the town of Milan. West of US9, NY308 continued to follow the old turnpike alignment to Hutton Street, where it connected to the KingstonRhinecliff Ferry. In 1947, the ferry was the only crossing of the Hudson River between Catskill (the Rip Van Winkle Bridge) and Poughkeepsie (the Mid-Hudson Bridge)—a distance of —and the only one serving the Kingston area.|$|E
5|$|The Rock Island Railroad {{built the}} first {{railroad}} bridge across the Mississippi River in 1856. It connected Davenport <b>to</b> <b>Rock</b> Island, Illinois. This railway connection resulted in significant improvements to transportation and commerce with Chicago, a booming 19th-century city. The addition of new railroad lines to Muscatine and Iowa City, and the acquisition of other lines by the Rock Island Railroad, resulted in Davenport becoming a commercial railroad hub.|$|E

5|$|The band's next album, For Those About <b>to</b> <b>Rock</b> We Salute You, {{was their}} first album to reach {{number one in the}} United States. Drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and {{replaced}} by ex-A II Z drummer Simon Wright, who left to join Dio in 1989. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade, who was with the band from 1989 to 1994, was asked to leave in favour of him, and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip, released in 2000, was well received by critics. The band's studio album, Black Ice, released in 2008, was the second highest-selling album of that year, and their biggest chart hit since For Those About <b>to</b> <b>Rock,</b> eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide. The band's line-up remained the same until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement due to early-onset dementia and Rudd's legal troubles. In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring on account of worsening hearing loss, and Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose stepped in as the band's vocalist for the remainder of that year's dates. Long-term bass player Cliff Williams retired from the band {{at the end of their}} 2016 Rock Or Bust world tour.|$|E
