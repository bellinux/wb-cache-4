25|$|Investigators said Gelhaus {{feared for}} his safety after Lopez {{turned around and}} {{allegedly}} raised the pellet gun in his direction (a replica of an AK-47 that was an air-soft gun that fired plastic pellets). Gelhaus <b>told</b> <b>investigators</b> <b>that</b> {{he could not remember}} if he verbally identified himself as a deputy sheriff, although he was in a deputy sheriff's uniform and marked sheriff's patrol car before firing at Lopez; however, Lopez would not have seen the uniform or patrol car since the officers approached him from behind.|$|E

25|$|One witness {{interviewed by}} the NTSB, a pilot driving on a road {{southwest}} of the airport, <b>told</b> <b>investigators</b> <b>that</b> he saw the airplane in normal flight at normal altitudes, and that {{he believed that the}} approach was not abnormal. The airplane completed a 180-degree turn from the downwind leg of the approach and continued the turn. He then saw the aircraft pitch slightly, before it rolled to the left until the wings were vertical. The airplane then turned nose-down and smashed into the ground. He saw no fire or smoke during the flight and he believed both propellers were rotating.|$|E
25|$|Société Générale characterizes Kerviel as a {{rogue trader}} and claims Kerviel worked these trades alone and without its authorization. These assertions {{have been met}} with {{skepticism}} by some of Kerviel's former colleagues and acquaintances, {{as well as by}} some members of the news media. Kerviel had <b>told</b> <b>investigators</b> <b>that</b> his trading behavior was widespread at the company and that making a profit made the hierarchy turn a blind eye. Kerviel published a book in May 2010, L'engrenage: Mémoires d’un Trader (The gears: Memoirs of a Trader), in which he alleges that his superiors knew of his trading activities, and that the practice was very common.|$|E

He then went to Billy Haas's Chophouse at 332 West 45th Street, where he ate dinner with Ritzi and William Klein, a lawyer friend. Klein later <b>told</b> <b>investigators</b> <b>that</b> Crater was {{in a good mood}} that evening and gave no {{indication}} that anything was bothering him. The dinner ended a little after 9 p.m., shortly after the curtain rose on the show for which Crater had bought a ticket, and the small group went outside.|$|E

25|$|Mexican {{investigators}} {{suspect that}} Tobares was kidnapped by organized crime members after seeing something suspicious at his workplace. His family <b>told</b> <b>investigators</b> <b>that</b> Tobares was once taken {{to one of}} his boss' private islands to cook at an exclusive party, so they suspect he encountered problems there. While on the island, he was not allowed to leave for a few days and was prohibited from using his cellphone. Investigators also believe Tobares may have been kidnapped by a rival gang as part of a retaliation campaign against his employers. His car was located two weeks after his disappearance in Michoacán, but no traces of Tobares' whereabouts were identified.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{majority}} of the interviewed witnesses, the airplane suddenly rolled to the left until the wings were perpendicular to the ground. The aircraft then descended in a nose-down attitude and disappeared from sight behind trees near the airport. One witness <b>told</b> <b>investigators</b> <b>that</b> they saw a puff of smoke emanate from the aircraft prior to or subsequent to the airplane rolling to the left. Others reported loud engine noises described as a squeal, whine, or an overspeeding or accelerating engine during the last moments of the flight, although they said that these noises seemed to have stopped, or at least faded before the aircraft impacted with flat ground two miles short of the runway.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} {{resulted in}} the first fatality on a spacecraft in flight since the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003. The survival of pilot Peter Siebold also {{marks the first time}} in history that anyone has survived the destruction of a spacecraft during a flight when others on board have died. Investigators are trying to determine how Siebold managed to get out of the rocket plane and parachute to the ground from an altitude of roughly 50,000 feet, an altitude virtually devoid of oxygen. On November 7, Siebold <b>told</b> <b>investigators</b> <b>that</b> the aircraft broke up around him. He was still strapped into his seat. He released the straps and his parachute later deployed automatically. Siebold was not wearing a pressure suit during the flight.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2004, Ney <b>told</b> Senate <b>investigators</b> <b>that</b> [...] "he {{was not at}} all {{familiar}} with the Tigua" [...] and could not recall meeting with members of the tribe.

50|$|Investigators {{then asked}} why the former councilman (claiming to be waiting innocently) went running through the woods when police came. Montana {{explained}} that someone yelled to run so he and Antonio followed through the door.

25|$|Two {{weeks before}} he was killed, Bermúdez Zacarías {{reached out to the}} Metepec {{municipal}} police for help and told them that he suspected that someone was following him. He also told this to Manuel Delgadillo Aguiñaga, one of his coworkers. After the murder, his coworker <b>told</b> <b>investigators</b> <b>that</b> Bermúdez Zacarías saw two suspicious men on a motorcycle one day in his neighborhood when he was coming back home from work. Bermúdez Zacarías decided to turn around in his car and drive away. Minutes later, he arrived home escorted by a Metepec police car. Despite fearing for his life, Bermúdez Zacarías did not officially ask for any sort of security measures or protection, and continued his daily activities as usual. According to his family, Bermúdez Zacarías never told them about this incident or that he faced any work-related death threats.|$|E
25|$|The murder {{investigation}} became a media sensation with {{the involvement of}} self-proclaimed psychic Peter Hurkos, who visited the gravesite of the Jacksons in Falls Church, Virginia and handled their possessions, allegedly using his powers to accurately describe the murders and the positions in which their bodies were found. Hurkos visited {{the site of the}} Margaret Harold murder, and <b>told</b> <b>investigators</b> <b>that</b> the same killer had murdered the Jacksons. He also made various predictions about the outcome of the case, saying that it would be solved within two weeks and that the killer would ultimately be indicted for nine murders. Hurkos reportedly led investigators to the house of one of their main suspects, a trash collector who confessed to the murders; with the later apprehension of Rees, however, Hurkos and his claims about the case were ridiculed by The Washington Post.|$|E
25|$|The {{day of the}} murder, an {{eyewitness}} came forward and <b>told</b> <b>investigators</b> <b>that</b> she allegedly saw {{the two young men}} involved in Bermúdez Zacarías' murder. She said that the two men were of slim complexion and may have been 24–25 years old; according to her description, one was fully dressed in black and that the other had dark pants and a white sweater. The woman saw them as she was driving through the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered. When she first saw the two men, she did not think they were suspicious because she thought they were construction workers from a nearby site. As she was driving down the street, she saw Bermúdez Zacarías on the road and thought that he had fainted. When she got close to the body, she noticed a pool of blood. She turned back to look at the two men, who kept walking down the street in an opposite direction.|$|E

25|$|Nearly nine classes lacked {{evidence}} that a professor taught course material and graded work. For one Swahili class, the syllabus listed AFAM chair Julius Nyang'oro as professor, but Nyang'oro <b>told</b> university <b>investigators</b> <b>that</b> he did not teach that class. For 40 other courses listing Nyang'oro as instructor, mostly during summer sessions, a professor was present during class but seldom taught.|$|R
50|$|Former Lockheed {{lobbyist}} Ernest Hauser <b>told</b> Senate <b>investigators</b> <b>that</b> West German Minister of Defence Franz Josef Strauss and {{his party}} had received at least $10 million {{for the purchase of}} 900 F-104G Starfighters in 1961. The party and its leader denied the allegations, and Strauss filed a slander suit against Hauser. As the allegations were not corroborated, the issue was dropped.|$|R
