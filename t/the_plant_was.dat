5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{laid out}} roughly {{north to south}} {{orientation}} along the Thames River. The plant itself {{is a mixture of}} interconnected buildings and stand-alone structures. The stand-alone structures included three propane sheds (Buildings 63, 64 and 65) that were located near the Human Resources building (Building 86) and its storage shed (Building 30). The main structure of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> a string of connecting buildings that were erected and integrated into the production and operation of the plant.
