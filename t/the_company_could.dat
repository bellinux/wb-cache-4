5|$|In October 1867, {{an agent}} for Swift & Co. {{negotiated}} a deal with Peru to purchase Catawba and her sister for a million dollars apiece. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, initially indicated that <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>could</b> repurchase the pair if it refunded the government's costs to build them, but {{changed his mind and}} said that he had no authority to do that. Congress debated the issue and ultimately decided that they would be appraised by a board of officers and that the highest competitive bid in equal to or in excess of the appraised value would be accepted. The ship was appraised at $375,000 and sold for that amount, possibly after a rigged bid, on 11 April 1868.|$|E
5|$|No {{immediate}} {{effort was}} made to start the works and they were postponed indefinitely when World War I started. With wartime restrictions in place, construction work for the railway was prevented. Yearly extensions to the earlier E acts were granted under special wartime powers each year from 1916 until 1922, giving a final date by which compulsory purchases had to be made of 7 August 1924. Although the permissions had been maintained, the UERL could not raise the money needed for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced by <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>could</b> not cover the cost of repaying loans.|$|E
5|$|Planning of the {{extension}} of the suburban light rail Holmenkollen Line to the city center started in 1901. Construction began in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>could</b> not agree on the location of the terminal station. The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien. The following year, the municipality launched a contest to make the best suggestion for the tram networks. It took five years to select a winner, and this allowed the municipality and company to make a compromise by locating the terminus at Nationaltheatret. But not until 1926 was permission granted for the station. Construction commenced and the station and tunnel opened in 1928.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{extending}} the Holmenkollen Line from Majorstuen {{to the city}} center had started in 1901. The process had been delayed several times because of disagreements between {{the city and the}} company, in part because the two could not agree if it should be classified as a railway or a tramway. Construction started in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>could</b> not agree on the location of the terminus. The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien, but this would make it difficult for the company to build the tunnel through the city center to connect to the suburban tramways east of the city center. Construction was stopped in October 1914.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of its {{contract}} with the city, <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>could</b> not cease operations. A lawsuit was brought by a pro-union citizen of the city, A. C. Pearson, against the company to revoke its contract or to force it into receivership so a receiver could negotiate with the strikers. The first court hearing was held on November 4, but the judge put the case on hold until the strike could be resolved. The case was later annulled on November 7 when the same judge ruled that Pearson had no standing to bring such a suit before the court.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{cash from}} Rothschild, <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>could</b> not raise {{sufficient}} investment to begin {{construction of the}} Oxford extension, and had only been given a five-year window by Parliament in which to build it. On 7 August 1888, {{less than two weeks}} before the authorisation was to expire, the directors of the Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company received Royal Assent for a revised and cheaper version. To be called the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad (O), the new scheme envisaged the extension's being built to the same light specifications as the existing tramway. To avoid expensive earthworks and tunnelling, the line would parallel a road out of Brill, despite the considerable gradients involved. The entire route would be single track, other than passing places, and the Oxford terminus was to be in George Street, nearer the edge of the city. Jones was sceptical and felt that it unlikely to recoup its construction costs.|$|E

5|$|Olympus had {{a market}} {{capitalisation}} of ¥673billion on 13 October 2011, immediately before Woodford was sacked. By {{the end of}} the next day, the valuation had fallen to ¥422billion ($5.5billion). Analysts at Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Nomura Securities, concerned about corporate governance issues at the company as well as its balance sheet, all immediately downgraded their stock ratings. Goldman Sachs, who had only upgraded its rating in a report dated 12 October, suspended its coverage after Woodford was removed from office. Nomura and JPMorgan announced on 20 October that their coverage of the company was halted. It was reported that Government of Singapore Investment Corp., the Singapore sovereign wealth fund {{which was one of the}} principal shareholders, immediately disposed of its 2percent stake on the first hint of scandal. The share price plunged several days running upon market fears that the shares would be delisted as <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>could</b> not meet its reporting mandatory deadline for its quarterly results; in the week to 18 November Nippon Life announced that its stake had been reduced by one-third, from 8.18 percent to 5.11 percent, because of the uncertainty; Mitsubishi reduced its stake from 10 percent to 7.6 percent.|$|E
5|$|Vanajan Autotehdas Oy (VAT) was a {{producer}} of heavy vehicles based in Hämeenlinna, Finland. The company was founded as Yhteissisu Oy in 1943 by the Finnish government {{and a number of}} major Finnish companies with the aim of producing lorries and buses for the Finnish Defence Forces. World War II was over before <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>could</b> start series production; it was renamed Vanajan Autotehdas and the marque became Vanaja. Subsequently, the production consisted of outdated lorry models, partly built from military surplus materials. After overcoming initial difficulties, the company modernised its products, became profitable and grew until the mid 1950s. Many major components, including engines, were imported. Diesel engines became widely available in 1955, and in 1959 VAT introduced its most significant innovation, the full load lifting tandem axle mechanism, which improved off-road capability significantly; the system is now used in Sisu vehicles.|$|E
5|$|With the New Year, {{the coins}} were dated 1893; just over four {{million of the}} {{authorized}} mintage were struck with an 1893 date, with the remainder dated 1892. A total of 5,002,105 Columbian half dollars were struck, with the excess over the authorized mintage designated for inspection by the annual Assay Commission. By February 1893, sales had fallen off dramatically. The Exposition Company deposited 2,000,000 half dollars in Chicago banks as security for loans. In March, Congress impounded an additional 1,141,700 half dollars to cover costs advanced by the government, such as the expense of judging exhibits and providing medals to the exhibitors. <b>The</b> <b>Company</b> <b>could</b> redeem the half dollars if it agreed to fund that expense, which it refused to do, calling the government's action a breach of faith.

5|$|In 1929 {{the company}} asked HM Treasury for an {{extension}} of the period in which government loans to <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>could</b> be paid. The Treasury first demanded an audit of the company accounts, and sent Sir William McClintock to write a report on the financial state of the company. McClintock's report revealed that the company had not earned any trading profits since 1925, but was still paying dividends by taking money from the reserves. The company had reported £439,000 profits for 1926, but had drawn £750,000 out of the reserves and falsified accounts to make it appear that the money came from trading. In 1927 the company made a trading loss of £507,000, but money was again drawn from the reserves to make it appear that the company had made a profit of £478,000. As a result of this, and a report that in 1928 the company had issued a fraudulent prospectus inviting customers to buy shares in the company and saying that it had earned an average £500,000 a year in the last decade, arrest warrants were issued for Lord Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor. At the time the ruse was discovered the company had a trading deficit of £300,000 a year, the reserves were completely exhausted, and the company owed £10 million.|$|E
5|$|To get {{satisfactory}} {{conditions for}} the loan, the company was recommended by banks to increase the ownership equity to 10% of the loan. The share capital was insufficient, so the company started issuing preferred shares to individuals and the companies, and managed to secure NOK1.7 million. An exception to the rules was made, and the company was allowed to start detailed planning before the loans had been finalized. An estimate from 1966 showed that the bridge itself would cost NOK27 million, while the auxiliary roads would cost NOK4 million, excluding inflation and interest during construction. On 23 November 1966, the county council supported a proposal that {{one third of the}} construction costs be covered by national road funds. On 10 August 1967, the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Norway gave permission that <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>could</b> borrow up to NOK25 million. The loan was a bond sold by Bergens Privatbank and Samvirke Forsikring, consisting of one series valued at NOK15 million issued in 1968, and one valued at NOK10 million issued in 1970, with an interest of 5.5% and 6.0%, respectively. There was a five years interest-only period, followed by ten years of repayment. The mortgage deed was secured in the right to collect tolls, supported by guarantees from the municipalities of Bergen, Fjell, Sund and Øygarden, and the county municipality. In addition, the company was granted loans from Bergens Privatbank, Bergens Sparebank and Vestlandsbanken for NOK3 million, although these were never used. The state's part of the financing was through a loan from the Regional Development Fund.|$|E
5|$|With {{no other}} way to readily obtain cash, DuMont sold WDTV to Westinghouse Electric Corporation for $9.75 million in late 1954. While this gave DuMont a {{short-term}} cash infusion, it eliminated the leverage the network had to get program clearances in other markets. Without its de facto monopoly in Pittsburgh, the company's advertising revenue shrank to less than half that of 1953. By February 1955, DuMont executives realized <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>could</b> not continue as a television network. The decision was made to shut down network operations and operate WABD and WTTG as independent stations. On April 1, 1955, most of DuMont's entertainment programs were dropped. Bishop Sheen aired his last program on DuMont on April 26 and later moved to ABC. By May, just eight programs were left on the network, with only inexpensive shows and sporting events keeping {{what was left of the}} network going through the summer. The network also largely abandoned the use of the intercity network coaxial cable, on which it had spent $3 million in 1954 to transmit shows that mostly lacked station clearance. The company only retained network links for live sports programming and utilizing the company's Electronicam process to produce studio-based programming. Ironically, Electronicam is best remembered for being used by Jackie Gleason's producers for the 39-half-hour episodes of The Honeymooners that aired on CBS during the 1955-56 television season.|$|E
