5|$|During the 1980s, Lundgren had {{relationships}} with Jamaican singer Grace Jones and American model Paula Barbieri. In 1994, he married Anette Qviberg, a jewellery designer and fashion stylist, in Marbella. The couple decided they liked Marbella {{so much that}} they rented accommodation <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>years,</b> before eventually buying a family home there. They have two daughters: Ida Sigrid Lundgren and Greta Eveline Lundgren, both born in Stockholm. Lundgren and Qviberg have cited the reason for living away from Hollywood is that they want to give their children as normal a childhood as possible. His father died in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In July 1941, Radford was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} Naval Air Station in Trinidad, British West Indies. He protested this appointment because he feared he would remain <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>years,</b> sidelined as World War II loomed. In the event he only remained in this station for three months, following an organizational shift in the Bureau of Aeronautics. By mid-1941, thanks to a large expansion in the naval aviator program, squadrons could no longer train newly arrived aviators. Further, at that time, the vast difference {{in the performance of}} combat aircraft over training aircraft meant that pilots needed more time in combat aircraft before becoming proficient in them. Radford was subsequently visited by Artemus L. Gates, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air. The latter was so impressed that he ordered Rear Admiral John H. Towers, chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, to transfer Radford to a newly formed training division.|$|E

25|$|Nutrients {{from human}} {{activities}} tend to accumulate in soils and remain <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> It {{has been shown}} that the amount of phosphorus lost to surface waters increases linearly with the amount of phosphorus in the soil.

25|$|The {{memorial}} is set {{within a}} garden {{and surrounded by}} iron railings. It is positioned inside the entrance to Martin's Hill, Bromley's first ornamental park. Martin's Hill was ostensibly named after a baker who once resided <b>there.</b> <b>For</b> <b>years,</b> the residents of Bromley promenaded on the hill. In {{the latter half of}} the 1800s, Martin's Hill had a commanding view of the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London. Bromley itself took its name from the broom, a yellow-flowered shrub, that once grew abundantly in the area. In the 1800s, Martin's Hill was one of the last places that still had flowering broom. In 1878, the site was acquired by the Bromley Council; trees and flower beds were planted, and it became an ornamental park.|$|E
25|$|As {{suggested}} by its specific epithet reclusa (recluse), the brown recluse spider is rarely aggressive, and bites from the species are uncommon. In 2001, more than 2,000 brown recluse spiders {{were removed from}} a heavily infested home in Kansas, yet the four residents who had lived <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> were never harmed by the spiders, despite many encounters with them. The spider usually bites only when pressed against the skin, such as when tangled within clothes, towels, bedding, inside work gloves, etc. Many human victims report having been bitten after putting on clothes {{that had not been}} worn recently, or had been left for many days undisturbed on the floor. The fangs of the brown recluse are so tiny they are unable to penetrate most fabric.|$|E

25|$|Antislavery {{sentiment}} {{among some}} {{groups in the}} North intensified after the Compromise of 1850, when Southerners began appearing in Northern states to pursue fugitives or often to claim as slaves free African Americans who had resided <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> Meanwhile, some abolitionists openly sought to prevent enforcement of the law. Violation of the Fugitive Slave Act was often open and organized. In Boston– a city from which it was boasted that no fugitive had ever been returned– Theodore Parker {{and other members of}} the city's elite helped form mobs to prevent enforcement of the law as early as April 1851. A pattern of public resistance emerged in city after city, notably in Syracuse in 1851 (culminating in the Jerry Rescue incident late that year), and Boston again in 1854. But the issue did not lead to a crisis until revived by the same issue underlying the Missouri Compromise of 1820: slavery in the territories.|$|E
25|$|As {{anthropogenic}} {{greenhouse gas}} emissions reduce {{the stability of the}} global climate, abrupt climate change could become more intense. The impact of an asteroid or comet larger than about 1km diameter has the potential to block the sun globally, causing impact winter. Particles in the troposphere would quickly rain out, but particles in the stratosphere, especially sulfate, could remain <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> Similarly, a supervolcanic eruption would reduce the potential of agricultural production from solar photosynthesis, causing volcanic winter. The Toba super volcanic eruption approximately 70,000 years ago may have nearly caused the extinction of humans (see Toba catastrophe theory). Again, primarily sulfate particles could block the sun for years. Solar blocking is not limited to natural causes as nuclear winter is also possible, which refers to the scenario involving widespread nuclear war and burning of cities that release soot into the stratosphere that would stay there for about 10 years. The high stratospheric temperatures produced by soot absorbing solar radiation would create near-global ozone hole conditions even for a regional nuclear conflict.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1830s a wealthy Jew named Shemarya Luria {{attempted}} to purchase houses near the Wall, but was unsuccessful, as was Jewish sage Abdullah of Bombay {{who tried to}} purchase the Western Wall in the 1850s. In 1869 Rabbi Hillel Moshe Gelbstein settled in Jerusalem. He arranged that benches and tables {{be brought to the}} Wall on a daily basis for the study groups he organised and the minyan which he led <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> He also formulated a plan whereby some of the courtyards facing the Wall would be acquired, with the intention of establishing three synagogues – one each for the Sephardim, the Hasidim and the Perushim. He also endeavoured to re-establish an ancient practice of [...] "guards of honour", which according to the mishnah in Middot, were positioned around the Temple Mount. He rented a house near the Wall and paid men to stand guard there and at various other gateways around the mount. However this set-up lasted only for a short time due to lack of funds or because of Arab resentment. In 1874, Mordechai Rosanes paid for the repaving of the alleyway adjacent to the wall.|$|E

2500|$|In 1573 a new {{academy in}} Padua, the Accademia degli Rinascenti, hired him as music-master with duties {{similar to those}} he had held at the {{previous}} academy of the Elevati; he even hired as assistants {{some of the same}} people who had helped him before. [...] Different this time was the existence of a rival academy in Padua, the Accademia degli Animosi, but neither academy lasted for long. [...] Competition from nearby Venice, one of the major musical centers of Europe at the time, was too intense to allow for multiple such institutions in Padua, and just three years later, in 1576, an outbreak of bubonic plague killed 12,000 in the city and ended most of the significant musical activity <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> [...] Portinaro himself survived the plague, and was hired as maestro di cappella at Padua Cathedral in December 1576, staying there at least through August 1577, from which month a payment record survives.

Henri Desgrange was angry at the cyclists for not {{attempting}} to beat Scieur, so he had the cyclists leave separately in the thirteenth stage. The [...] "second class" [...] cyclists started two hours earlier than the sponsored [...] "first class" [...] cyclists. Although the stage was won by an unsponsored cyclist from the second class, Félix Sellier, this did not help for the general classification, as Scieur and Heusghem still finished together. The Tour organisers wanted the second class cyclists to start two hours later in the fourteenth stage, but they threatened with a strike, and the cyclists could start together. The fourteenth stage had a remarkable incident: Scieur's wheel broke, and 11 spokes were broken. According to the rules, a broken item could only be replaced when repair was not possible. Because there was no Tour official close to Scieur who could verify that the wheel was broken beyond repair, Scieur strapped the broken wheel to his back and rode with it for more than , which left scars on his back that remained <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> In the last stage, Scieur finished a few minutes behind Heusghem, but his victory was never in danger.|$|E
