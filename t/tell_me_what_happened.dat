6000|$|... "At a guess, because love is {{stronger}} than fear," [...] I replied. [...] "But it seems that you dreamed {{a little longer than}} I did.

6000|$|That {{hour and}} twenty minutes went like a flash, for {{we had so}} much {{to say to each other}} that we never even got to the things we wanted to say. For instance, I began to tell her about King Solomon's Mines, which was a long story; and she to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> after we parted on the shores of the Red Sea. At least the first hour and a quarter went, when {{suddenly}} the door opened and Alfred in a somewhat frightened voice announced--"Mr. and Mrs. Atterby-Smith, the Misses Atterby-Smith and Mr. Atterby-Smith junior." ...|$|E

50|$|We {{were playing}} {{like a bunch}} of punks, says Riley. I was so mad, I hit the locker room door as hard as I could to prove a point. Sometimes, you role play as a coach. I could even put tears in my eyes to {{emphasize}} a point. But, this time, I didn’t have to role play. I was really mad. As soon as I hit it, I knew I’d broken something. The next day, I walked in and had it in a cast. I was hiding it inside my sports jacket. For three-quarters of the pre-game meal, I looked like Napoleon. Of course, there was no real hiding it. It was pretty embarrassing, says Riley. I’d go to the bank teller and she’d say, What happened to your arm? Oh, you don’t want to know. No, <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to your arm? Well, I punched a locker room door. And she’d give me that look, like, Oh, how childish, how juvenile, how immature.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} some of the most {{successful}} serials of Spanish TV fiction. They all have in common thehope to "tell the factual History", that is, the hope to tell the truth. However, do all these serials really want to tell whathappened or, rather, they settle for fostering a bittersweet flavour viewers are fully aware of and take pleasure in?By looking at the recently broadcast serials Cuéntame cómo pasó (<b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> <b>happened)</b> and Amar en tiemposrevueltos (Loving in Unsettled Times) as well as at their ancestor Chronicle of a Village, the author discusses how theplots, in different settings, of such TV fiction serials are built on.

6000|$|I {{dare not}} trust myself to write down, the kind words {{that have been}} said to me {{especially}} by Miss Verinder and Mr. Blake. Besides, it is needless.
