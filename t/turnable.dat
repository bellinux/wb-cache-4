5|$|Almost a year later, in August 1981, Voyager 2 {{continued}} {{the study of}} the Saturn system. More close-up images of Saturn's moons were acquired, as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings. Unfortunately, during the flyby, the probe's <b>turnable</b> camera platform stuck {{for a couple of days}} and some planned imaging was lost. Saturn's gravity was used to direct the spacecraft's trajectory towards Uranus.|$|E
5|$|From 1936, NSB took {{delivery}} of Class 65 multiple units, replacing El 1 {{as the primary}} hauler on the electrified commuter rail network. Class 65 were the first that were optimized for local traffic, with wide doors and <b>turnable</b> seats. NSB took {{delivery of}} 49 units until 1952, although they were also used outside the commuter rail network. The Østfold Line was upgraded to double track and put into service in four sections: from Bekkelaget to Ljan on 1 June 1924, from OsloØ to Bekkelaget on 15 May 1929, from Ljan to Kolbotn on 15 December 1936 and from Kolbotn to Ski on 14 May 1939. The Østfold Line was also the next line to be electrified, which opened in sections between 1936 and 1940. NSB took into use El 8 locomotives on the line.|$|E

40|$|Wings whose {{surfaces}} arc developable {{have been}} milled on a jig-borer at the National Aeronautical Laboratory, Bangalore, employing tangential milling. In this process, the Wing cross-section is approximated by a polygon {{which can be}} smoothened by hand-finish. The polygonal approximation itself is such that {{each side of the}} polygon is a tangent to the aerofoil. The aerofoil is defined by a finite set of points got from experiments or otherwise. These points are joined smoothly by using Spline approximation to achieve continuity of first and second 13; derivatives. The splines and the settings of the jig-borer (for tangential milling) were obtained on the NAL SIRIUS Computer. Each setting of the jig-borer consists of the cutter-height and two turnings of the <b>turnables</b> one about the axis perpendicular to the turntable and the other about a fixed horizontal axis, so that the plane of milling becomes horizontal. The two angles of rotation and the cutter height depend upon the Wing geometry besides some of the machine parameters...|$|R

Besides Rubik's cube, the tetrahedron is available as the Pyraminx, the octahedron as the Face Turning Octahedron, the dodecahedron as the Megaminx, and the icosahedron as the Icosaix.|$|E

500|$|Edd Byrnes, {{an actor}} from 77 Sunset Strip, served as host {{for the second}} and third pilots, both titled Wheel of Fortune. These pilots were {{directed}} by Marty Pasetta, who gave the show a [...] "Vegas" [...] feel that more closely resembled the look and feel that the actual show ended up having, a wheel that was now spun by the contestants themselves, and a lighted mechanical puzzle board with letters that were now manually <b>turnable.</b> Showcase prizes on these pilots were located behind the puzzle board, and during shopping segments a list of prizes and their price values scrolled on the right of the screen. By the time production began in December 1974, Woolery was selected to host, the choice being made by Griffin after he reportedly heard Byrnes reciting [...] "A-E-I-O-U" [...] to himself in an effort to remember the vowels. Susan Stafford turned the letters on Byrnes' pilot episodes, a role that she also held when the show was picked up as a series.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} solar panels {{may also be}} mounted {{vertically}} above {{each other in a}} tower, if the zenith distance of the Sun is greater than zero, and the tower can be turned horizontally as a whole and each panels additionally around a horizontal axis. In such a tower the panels can follow the Sun exactly. Such a device may be described as a ladder mounted on a <b>turnable</b> disk. Each step of that ladder is the middle axis of a rectangular solar panel. In case the zenith distance of the Sun reaches zero, the [...] "ladder" [...] may be rotated to the north or the south to avoid a solar panel producing a shadow on a lower solar panel. Instead of an exactly vertical tower one can choose a tower with an axis directed to the polar star, meaning that it is parallel to the rotation axis of the Earth. In this case the angle between the axis and the Sun is always larger than 66 degrees. During a day it is only necessary to turn the panels around this axis to follow the Sun. Installations may be ground-mounted (and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing) or built into the roof or walls of a building (building-integrated photovoltaics).|$|E
