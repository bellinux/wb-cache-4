5|$|In 2005, the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) {{remotely}} operated vehicle, KAIKO, collected sediment core from the Challenger Deep. 432 living specimens of soft-walled foraminifera {{were identified in}} the sediment samples. Foraminifera are single-celled protists that construct shells. There are an estimated 4,000 species of living foraminifera. Out of the 432 organisms collected, {{the overwhelming majority of}} <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>consisted</b> of simple, soft-shelled foraminifera, with others representing species of the complex, multi-chambered genera Leptohalysis and Reophax. Overall, 85% of the specimens consisted of soft-shelled allogromids. This is unusual compared to samples of sediment-dwelling organisms from other deep-sea environments, where the percentage of organic-walled foraminifera ranges from 5% to 20% of the total. Small organisms with hard calciferous shells have trouble growing at extreme depths because the water at that depth is severely lacking in calcium carbonate.|$|E

50|$|The Norwegian Institute of Transport Economics {{conducted}} in March 2016 a survey among over 8,000 vehicle owners in Norway. The study's {{aim was to}} identified how the plug-in vehicles are used, why they are bought and how the technology is rated compared to owners of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>consisted</b> of 3,111 all-electric vehicles (BEV) owners, 2,065 private plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners, and 3,080 ICE vehicle owners. The study found that buyers of BEVs and PHEVs have different transport needs but both are motivated by economy of use and environment, whereas all-electric vehicle owners are also motivated by the free toll road incentive. The survey showed that normally diesel and gasoline vehicles are replaced with {{the purchase of a}} plug-in vehicle, but a larger share of battery electric vehicles become extra vehicles in households. BEV owners are younger, have more children, travel a longer distance to work and own more vehicles than other vehicle owners.|$|E
