5|$|In 1946, Szilard {{secured a}} {{research}} professorship at the University of Chicago {{that allowed him}} to dabble in biology and the social sciences. He teamed up with Aaron Novick, a chemist who had worked at the Metallurgical Laboratory during the war. The two men saw biology as a field that had not been explored as much as physics, and was ready for scientific breakthroughs. It was a field that Szilard had been working on in 1933 before he had become subsumed in <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> nuclear chain reaction. The duo made considerable advances. They invented the chemostat, a device for regulating the growth rate of the microorganisms in a bioreactor, and developed methods for measuring the growth rate of bacteria. They discovered feedback inhibition, an important factor in processes such as growth and metabolism. Szilard gave essential advice to Theodore Puck and Philip I. Marcus for their first cloning of a human cell in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to all other}} modern theories of fundamental interactions, general relativity is a classical theory: {{it does not include}} the effects of quantum physics. <b>The</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quantum version of general relativity addresses one of the most fundamental open questions in physics. While there are promising candidates for such a theory of quantum gravity, notably string theory and loop quantum gravity, there is at present no consistent and complete theory. It has long been hoped that a theory of quantum gravity would also eliminate another problematic feature of general relativity: the presence of spacetime singularities. These singularities are boundaries ("sharp edges") of spacetime at which geometry becomes ill-defined, with the consequence that general relativity itself loses its predictive power. Furthermore, there are so-called singularity theorems which predict that such singularities must exist within the universe if the laws of general relativity were to hold without any quantum modifications. The best-known examples are the singularities associated with the model universes that describe black holes {{and the beginning of the}} universe.|$|E

25|$|The Napoleonic Wars {{were the}} cause of the final {{dissolution}} of the Holy Roman Empire, and ultimately the cause for <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> German nation state in 19th-century German nationalism. After the Congress of Vienna, Austria and Prussia emerged as two competitors. Austria, trying to remain the dominant power in Central Europe, led the way in the terms of the Congress of Vienna. The Congress of Vienna was essentially conservative, assuring that little would change in Europe and preventing Germany from uniting. These terms came to a sudden halt following the Revolutions of 1848 and the Crimean War in 1856, paving the way for German unification in the 1860s. By the 1820s, large numbers of Jewish German women had intermarried with Christian German men and had converted to Christianity. Jewish German Eduard Lasker was a prominent German nationalist figure who promoted the unification of Germany in the mid-19th century.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sixth {{championship}} in the 2011/12 campaign saw the Wildcats jostle over top {{spot for the}} majority of the season with the defending champion New Zealand Breakers. Thanks to a controversial overtime victory in Perth late in the season, it was the Breakers that took the minor premiership but it seemed destined that New Zealand and the Wildcats would meet in the Grand Final. That indeed happened after the Wildcats disposed of the Gold Coast Blaze in three games in the Semi Final series. The Wildcats and Breakers then took part in one of the all-time great grand final series, but ultimately it was New Zealand that had home court advantage which led to them winning the {{championship in}} three games. In his third season in Perth, Lisch was simply brilliant and subsequently took home the Andrew Gaze Trophy as the league's MVP – making him just the second Wildcat to achieve that honour.|$|E
25|$|Between 1809 and 1813, Slovenia {{was part}} of the Illyrian Provinces, an {{autonomous}} province of the Napoleonic French Empire, with Ljubljana as the capital. Although the French rule was short-lived, it significantly contributed to the rise of national consciousness and political awareness of Slovenes. After the fall of Napoleon, all Slovene Lands were once again included in the Austrian Empire. Gradually, a distinct Slovene national consciousness developed, and <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> political unification of all Slovenes became widespread. In the 1820s and 1840s, the interest in Slovene language and folklore grew enormously, with numerous philologists advancing the first steps towards a standardization of the language. Illyrian movement, Pan-Slavic and Austro-Slavic ideas gained importance. However, the intellectual circle around the philologist Matija Čop and the Romantic poet France Prešeren was influential in affirming the idea of Slovene linguistic and cultural individuality, refusing the idea of merging Slovenes into a wider Slavic nation.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea behind}} the {{pinewood}} derby is for the parent, usually the father, but sometimes the mother or grandparent, to spend time helping the child design, carve, paint, add weights, and tune the final car. However, it {{is often the case}} that the parent takes over the construction of the car, an aspect of the event that was lampooned in the 2005 film Down and Derby, and also in a 2009 episode of South Park. <b>The</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fast car supports a cottage industry that supplies modified wheels, axles, and blocks as well as videos and instruction books. While a pinewood derby car kit costs around US$4, a set of modified wheels and axles can sell for more than ten times that amount. Each pack sets its own rules under the guidelines set forth by the BSA and their particular local district. The aftermarket items are legal under some Pack rules since the parts originally came from an official Boy Scouts of America (BSA) kit. Complete cars can be purchased on eBay and elsewhere for around $100 to $200, and PineCar, a subsidiary of Woodland Scenics, sells pre-cut or pre-made cars, as well as official kits. Although these cars violate the spirit of the event, if not the rules, enforcement can be difficult.|$|E

500|$|When the larva {{is fully}} grown, hormones such as prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) are produced. At {{this point the}} larva stops feeding, and begins [...] "wandering" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{suitable}} pupation site, often the underside of a leaf or other concealed location. There it spins a button of silk which it uses to fasten its body {{to the surface and}} moults for a final time. While some caterpillars spin a cocoon to protect the pupa, most species do not. The naked pupa, often known as a chrysalis, usually hangs head down from the cremaster, a spiny pad at the posterior end, but in some species a silken girdle may be spun to keep the pupa in a head-up position. Most of the tissues and cells of the larva are broken down inside the pupa, as the constituent material is rebuilt into the imago. The structure of the transforming insect is visible from the exterior, with the wings folded flat on the ventral surface and the two halves of the proboscis, with the antennae and the legs between them.|$|E
500|$|With the {{publication}} of the 25th anniversary edition in 2000, the historians of biology Michael Yudell and Rob Desalle reviewed the nature-nurture controversy around the book. [...] "Once again", they wrote, [...] "biological reductionism and genetic determinism became the focus of rancorous debates, discussions and diatribes within both academia and popular culture." [...] They pointed out that <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> [...] "sociobiologization" [...] of biology was not new, mentioning Darwin's The Descent of Man, R.A. Fisher, and Julian Huxley, all touching on the biological basis of human society, followed by Konrad Lorenz, Desmond Morris and Robert Ardrey in the 1960s, and Richard Dawkins and David Barash in the 1970s. Wilson's choice of title echoed the modern synthesis (named by Huxley in 1942) and, the reviewers argued, meant to build upon and extend it. 25 years on, they noted, most of the discord had gone, and the discipline had been renamed as evolutionary psychology; they were surprised to find that Wilson was happy with that, and they called the new discipline pop psychology for people [...] "who like telling just-so stories".|$|E
500|$|Often {{against the}} views of his superiors, Devers lobbied for a still more heavily armored and better armed medium tank, the M4 Sherman. He played an {{important}} role in the M4's design, development and manufacturing, particularly its engine and armament. Throughout his tour as Chief of the Armored Force he worked closely with the Ordnance Department, manufacturers and the Armored Force Board at Fort Knox on the research and testing of tanks, guns, armored vehicles and ammunition. The biggest obstacle was engines. Those of pre-war tanks were rated at , which was insufficient for a [...] medium tank. Devers wanted an [...] engine, but this was beyond the ability of the American automotive industry to produce. Extraordinary efforts resulted in the development of a number of [...] engines. He controversially rejected the General Motors 6046 diesel engine in favor of gasoline engines. Battlefield experience would demonstrate that the diesel engine was superior. <b>The</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> better engine eventually settled on the Ford GAA engine, but there was a persistent shortage of tank engines. Some 49,234 of the reliable, versatile, low-cost M4 Sherman and its variants would be produced.|$|E

500|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, Sesame Street was, as Davis put it, [...] "the undisputed heavyweight {{champion}} of preschool television". [...] Entertainment Weekly reported in 1991 that the show's music had been honored with eight Grammys. [...] The show's dominance, however, was soon challenged by another PBS television show for preschoolers, Barney & Friends, and Sesame Street's ratings declined. [...] The producers of Sesame Street responded, at the show's twenty-fifth anniversary in 1993, by expanding and redesigning the show's set, calling it [...] "Around the Corner". [...] New human and Muppet characters were introduced, including Zoe (performed by Fran Brill), baby Natasha {{and her parents}} Ingrid and Humphrey, and Ruthie (played by comedian Ruth Buzzi). [...] The [...] "Around the Corner" [...] set was dismantled in 1997. [...] Zoe, {{one of the few}} characters that survived, was created to include another female Muppet on the show: her spunky and fearless personality was intended to break female stereotypes. [...] According to Davis, she was the first character developed on the show by marketing and product development specialists, who worked with the researchers at the CTW. [...] (<b>The</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> [...] "break-out" [...] female Muppet character continued into 2006 with the creation of Abby Cadabby, who was created after nine months of research.)
