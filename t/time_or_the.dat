He maintains these orders are distinct, so one order cannot dictate to the other. Here he says that he agrees with Kant, who made a distinction between the world of phenomena and the noumenon, although he is critical of Kant’s disregard for mystical experience.|$|E

Robotics simulators allow reproducing situations that cannot be 'created' in the real world because of cost, <b>time,</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> 'uniqueness' of a resource. A simulator also allows fast robot prototyping. Many robot simulators feature physics engines to simulate a robot's dynamics.|$|E
25|$|Gladwell (2008) {{showed that}} the {{relationship}} between individual IQ and success works only to a certain point and that additional IQ points over an estimate of IQ 120 do not translate into real life advantages. If a similar border exists for Group-IQ or if advantages are linear and infinite, has still to be explored. Similarly, demand for further research on possible connections of individual and collective intelligence exists within plenty of other potentially transferable logics of individual intelligence, such as, for instance, the development over <b>time</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> question of improving intelligence. Whereas it is controversial whether human intelligence can be enhanced via training, a group's collective intelligence potentially offers simpler opportunities for improvement by exchanging team members or implementing structures and technologies. Moreover, social sensitivity was found to be, at least temporarily, improvable by reading literary fiction as well as watching drama movies. In how far such training ultimately improves collective intelligence through social sensitivity remains an open question.|$|E

25|$|In First-class cricket (two innings match), {{the team}} that scores more runs, having {{dismissed}} its opponents twice, is the winner. An example would be: Team A scored 240 in their first innings, and Team B made 225 in reply. Team A then made 300 for 7 in their second innings, declaring it closed (they might do this because {{there was not much}} time left in the match and wanted to have time to dismiss team B and win rather than draw the game). Team A would be setting team B a target of 316 to win. If, in the second innings, team B only scored 250 (indeed anything less than 315) then team A would be the winner. If, on the other hand, team B scored 316–9, team B would be the winner. If <b>time</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> weather prevents the opposing side's being dismissed twice, the game is a draw, even if one side has scored more than the other. There is no equivalent of Duckworth-Lewis Method in these matches.|$|E
25|$|By mid-1991, the Soviet Union {{had reached}} a state of emergency. According to the {{official}} commission (the Soviet Academy of Sciences) appointed by the Supreme Soviet (the higher chamber of the Russian parliament) immediately after the events of August 1991, the Army did not {{play a significant role}} in what some describe as coup d'état of old-guard communists. Commanders sent tanks into the streets of Moscow, but (according to all the commanders and soldiers) only with orders to ensure the safety of the people. It remains unclear why exactly the military forces entered the city, but they clearly did not have the goal of overthrowing Gorbachev (absent on the Black Sea coast at the <b>time)</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> government. The coup failed primarily because the participants did not take any decisive action, and after several days of their inaction the coup simply stopped. Only one confrontation took place between civilians and the tank crews during the coup, which led to the deaths of three civilians. Although the victims became proclaimed heroes, the authorities acquitted the tank crew of all charges. Nobody issued orders to shoot at anyone.|$|E

[...] However, she blamed the network for this ending. She also commented on the tone and themes of the episode, arguing that one of the series's main takeaways was that the rich would always be in charge. However, she did not view the finale as being spiteful and pessimistic: [...] "'Veronica Mars' has always been a clear-eyed show, never a bitter one." [...] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly felt unsatisfied with the episode's conclusion, partially because Veronica and Logan did not resume dating. However, he praised the sex-tape mystery and the plot involving the Castle because of their similarities to earlier seasons. He also praised Keith's actions, stating, [...] "Okay, maybe I'm a sap, but this tugged at my heartstrings a bit and left me relieved there wasn't a dreaded Veronica–Keith battle at the end." [...] Stransky concluded by saying that [...] "the end is fine". Sydney Bucksbaum of Zap2it felt disappointed because of the ambiguous endings of Keith's arc and Veronica's love triangle. Although she was positive towards [...] "The Bitch Is Back" [...] as a standalone episode, she found herself hoping that there were another episode to the season: [...] "Watching Veronica walk out into the pouring rain all alone after casting a probably insignificant vote for her dad was depressing, symbolic (rain in SoCal?), and just downright unsatisfying." ...|$|E
