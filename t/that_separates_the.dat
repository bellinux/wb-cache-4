5|$|Baleen whales {{have two}} {{flippers}} on the front, near the head. Like all mammals, baleen whales breathe air and must surface periodically to do so. Their nostrils, or blowholes, are {{situated at the}} top of the cranium. Baleen whales have two blowholes, as opposed to toothed whales which have one. These paired blowholes are longitudinal slits that converge anteriorly and widen posteriorly, which causes a V-shaped blow. They are surrounded by a fleshy ridge that keeps water away while the whale breathes. The septum <b>that</b> <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> blowholes has two plugs attached to it, making the blowholes water-tight while the whale dives.|$|E

5|$|I-70 {{exits the}} valley through De Beque Canyon, a path carved by the Colorado River <b>that</b> <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> Book Cliffs from Battlement Mesa. The river {{and its tributaries}} provide the course for the ascent up the Rocky Mountains. In the canyon, I-70 enters the Beavertail Mountain Tunnel, {{the first of several}} tunnels built to route the freeway across the Rockies. This tunnel design {{features}} a curved sidewall, unusual for tunnels in the United States, where most tunnels feature a curved roof and flat side-walls. Engineers borrowed a European design to give the tunnel added strength. After the canyon winds past the Book Cliffs, the highway follows the Colorado River through a valley containing the communities of Parachute and Rifle.|$|E
5|$|In {{the town}} of Lysander, NY48 {{overlaps}} NY631 for a short distance westward to an intersection with {{the northern end of}} NY690. Here, NY48 turns north, and begins to run as an alternate to NY481. Both routes run from the Syracuse area to downtown Oswego. NY48 runs right along the western side of the Oswego River, while NY481 runs along {{the eastern side of the}} river. Both routes run through downtown Fulton and Oswego which are the two cities along the Oswego River. At several points, all <b>that</b> <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> two routes is the river itself.|$|E
5|$|Near Cape Mendocino, the Mendocino Triple Junction {{is an area}} {{of active}} {{seismicity}} where three tectonic plates come together. The Mendocino Fracture Zone (also known as the Mendocino Fault east of the Gorda Ridge) is a transform fault <b>that</b> <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> Pacific and Gorda Plates. To the south, the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and North American Plate is accommodated by the San Andreas Fault, and to the north, the Gorda Plate is converging with the North American Plate at the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Earthquakes within the Gorda Plate are the result of north-south compression at the Mendocino Fault.|$|E

5|$|The plasma {{membrane}} is a phospholipid bilayer membrane <b>that</b> <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> cell from its environment and regulates {{the transport of}} molecules and signals {{into and out of}} the cell. Embedded in the membrane are proteins that perform the functions of the {{plasma membrane}}. The plasma membrane is not a fixed or rigid structure, the molecules that compose the membrane are capable of lateral movement. This movement and the multiple components of the membrane are why it is referred to as a fluid mosaic. Smaller molecules such as carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen can pass through the plasma membrane freely by diffusion or osmosis. Larger molecules needed by the cell are assisted by proteins through active transport.|$|E
5|$|The two holes—circular, oval or slit-like in shape—which lead to {{the nasal}} {{cavities}} within the bird's skull, and thus {{to the rest of}} the respiratory system. In most bird species, the nares are located in the basal third of the upper mandible. Kiwis are a notable exception; their nares are located at the tip of their bills. A handful of species have no external nares. Cormorants and darters have primitive external nares as nestlings, but these close soon after the birds fledge; adults of these species (and gannets and boobies of all ages, which also lack external nostrils) breathe through their mouths. There is typically a septum made of bone or cartilage <b>that</b> <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> two nares, but in some families (including gulls, cranes and New World vultures), the septum is missing. While the nares are uncovered in most species, they are covered with feathers in a few groups of birds, including grouse and ptarmigans, crows and some woodpeckers.|$|E
