25|$|The {{relationship}} between habitus and field is two-way. The field exists {{only insofar as}} social agents possess the dispositions and set of perceptual schemata {{that are necessary to}} constitute that field and imbue it with meaning. Concomitantly, by participating in the field, agents incorporate into their habitus the proper know-how <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> to constitute the field. Habitus manifests the structures of the field, and the field mediates between habitus and practice.|$|E
25|$|Simcha Zissel {{explained}} {{that a person}} can only progress in life and perceive God by clearing his mind of confusion and haphazard thinking. Once a person has done this, {{they will be able}} to achieve a level of equanimity and clarity of mind <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> to plan a path through life that is independent of the fallacies that are the subconscious product of personal weakness and temptations. They will also be able to recognise the subtleties (subtleness) of God's manifestation in the world.|$|E
25|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{is a consequence}} of a female-biased operational sex ratio. This means that at any given time, there are more females than males seeking to copulate. This occurs because males lose up to 11% of their body mass during mating and once they are done mating, they need time to sequester resources <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> to deliver a spermatophore to the next female they mate with. On the contrary, females do not need time to prepare for their next copulation. Due to the unequal mating rates, males become valuable to females and female-to-female competition rises dramatically as a consequence.|$|E

The letter, which was {{discovered}} by Mickey during the events of Kingdom Hearts Coded, describes the parts of their past that Naminé learned while restoring Sora's memory. As they read the letter, they learn about the fates of three Keyblade wielders {{at the hands of}} Xehanort during the events of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep (a decade before Kingdom Hearts): Terra is possessed by Xehanort; Ventus, whom Xehanort attempts to turn into the legendary χ-blade, sacrifices his heart to stop him and hides it within a four-year-old Sora's; and new Keyblade Master Aqua ends up trapped in the realm of darkness after sacrificing herself to save Terra. King Mickey also discovers that the destruction of [...] "Ansem" [...] and Xemnas has led to the reconstruction of Xehanort.

500|$|In [...] "Goodbye Stranger", Castiel {{has been}} {{completely}} brainwashed by Naomi and has killed thousands of copies of Dean ruthlessly. Castiel is sent to find the angel tablet and tortures and kills the demons also looking for it, drawing Sam and Dean's attention. Sam and Dean track down someone who knows the location of one of Lucifer's Crypts where the angel tablet is and in ensuing scuffle, Sam ends up in trouble. Castiel saves Sam and captures one of the demons, claiming under Naomi's orders that he is searching {{for the second half}} of the demon tablet and that the demons are searching for a parchment <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> to translate it without a Prophet. Castiel tortures the demon who tells them where to find Meg, but kills her before she can reveal the truth to Sam and Dean. Castiel heads off alone and rescues Meg who explains what the demons really want. While Naomi initially wants her killed to prevent that, Castiel is able to make a case to keep her alive. The group then go to the warehouse where the crypt is and before heading inside with Dean, Castiel reveals that Sam is damaged by his trials on a level that even Castiel can't fix. Castiel and Dean locate the angel tablet and Castiel has to have Dean get it as it is warded against angels. However, Naomi orders Castiel to kill Dean and though he fights it, he has no control over his actions. As he is about to kill him, Dean manages to break through to Castiel's heart and he breaks free of Naomi's influence. He picks up the angel tablet which completely severs Naomi's connection to and control over him. Castiel heals Dean and explains what happened, but senses that he must now protect the tablet from everyone, even Dean. Castiel is later seen traveling on a bus to an unknown destination with the tablet. Despite losing the tablet, Naomi is somewhat satisfied as according to her, Castiel is doing what he is supposed to be doing. Naomi later comes to Dean. [...] In an attempt to gain his trust, presumably because she knows Castiel is one of his weak spots, she lies to Dean about Castiel and claims that he misinterpreted everything she has done and is still insane. Dean, of course, doesn't believe her. Despite this, Castiel is eventually captured by Naomi's forces, but the angel tablet is claimed by Crowley after one of Naomi's angels betrays their location, although this gives Castiel time to escape and reunite with the Winchesters after killing the angel guarding him.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the [...] "one party" [...] convention, Prime Ministers {{may still}} {{be called upon to}} lead either {{minority}} or coalition governments. A minority government may be formed {{as a result of a}} [...] "hung parliament" [...] in which no single party commands a majority in the House of Commons after a general election or the death, resignation or defection of existing members. By convention the serving Prime Minister is given the first opportunity to reach agreements <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> to survive a vote of confidence in the House and continue to govern. The last minority government was led by Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson for eight months after the February 1974 general election produced a hung parliament.

2500|$|Homophobia in the Latino {{community}} is also prevalent within the United States. Many Latinos {{feel like a}} double minority for being both an ethnic minority and a sexual minority. As a result, queer Latinos must straddle multiple cultures at once and take on somewhat contradictory identities {{in order to maintain}} ties within each group – a concept Gloria Anzaldúa calls the [...] "mestiza consciousness". At the same time, they often have to create a [...] "borderland" [...] space for themselves <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> to freely express their sexuality without consequences. Because queer Latinos are often marginalized in both LGBT communities (because of race) and Latino communities (because of sexuality), the borderland spaces that exist are often composed strictly of queer Latinos. An example of such a space would be the community that the magazine Esto no tiene nombre created among Latina lesbians around the world.|$|E

Gumballs and candy have a relatively long shelf life, enabling vending machine operators to manage many machines without too much time or cost involved. In addition, the machines are typically inexpensive compared to soft drink or snack machines, which often require power and sometimes refrigeration to work.
