Although CaPO 4 with the composition close to that of TCP, CDHA and HA were known in 1770 s (Dorozhkin 2012 a, 2013 a), α- and β-polymorphs of TCP were differentiated only by 1932 (Bredig et al. 1932; Trömel 1932).|$|E
3000|$|... α-Tricalcium {{phosphate}} [α-Ca 3 (PO 4) 2; the IUPAC name is {{tricalcium diorthophosphate}} alpha, other names are CaPO 4 tribasic alpha or <b>tricalcium</b> <b>bis(orthophosphate)</b> alpha] is another polymorph of TCP, which was differentiated by 1932 (Bredig et al. 1932; Trömel 1932). α-TCP {{is also a}} high-temperature phase; therefore, it cannot be precipitated from aqueous solutions either. Thus, α-TCP is usually prepared by the same techniques as β-TCP (see the previous section) but, since the β-TCP → α-TCP transition temperature is ~ 1125  °C (Welch and Gutt 1961), calcining is performed at temperatures above ~ 1200  °C (Jokic et al. 2007). Consequently, α-TCP is often considered as a high-temperature polymorph of β-TCP. However, data are available that α-TCP might be prepared at lower temperatures. Namely, {{at the turn of}} the millennium, the previously forgotten data that the presence of silicates stabilized α-TCP at temperatures of 800 – 1000  °C (Nurse et al. 1959) were rediscovered again. Such type of α-TCP is called “silica stabilized α-TCP” (Sayer et al. 2003; Reid et al. 2005, 2006). Furthermore, sometimes, α-TCP might be prepared at even lower temperatures (~ 700  °C) by a thermal decomposition of low-temperature ACPs (Kanazawa et al. 1982).|$|E
