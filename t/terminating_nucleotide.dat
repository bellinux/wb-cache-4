50|$|In chain {{terminator}} sequencing (Sanger sequencing), extension is initiated {{at a specific}} site on the template DNA by using a short oligonucleotide 'primer' complementary to the template at that region. The oligonucleotide primer is extended using a DNA polymerase, an enzyme that replicates DNA. Included with the primer and DNA polymerase are the four deoxynucleotide bases (DNA building blocks), along with a low concentration of a chain <b>terminating</b> <b>nucleotide</b> (most commonly a di-deoxynucleotide). Limited incorporation of the chain <b>terminating</b> <b>nucleotide</b> by the DNA polymerase results {{in a series of}} related DNA fragments that are terminated only at positions where that particular nucleotide is used. The fragments are then size-separated by electrophoresis in a slab polyacrylamide gel, or more commonly now, in a narrow glass tube (capillary) filled with a viscous polymer.An alternative to the labelling of the primer is to label the terminators instead, commonly called 'dye terminator sequencing'. The major advantage of this approach is the complete sequencing set can be performed in a single reaction, rather than the four needed with the labeled-primer approach. This is accomplished by labelling each of the dideoxynucleotide chain-terminators with a separate fluorescent dye, which fluoresces at a different wavelength. This method is easier and quicker than the dye primer approach, but may produce more uneven data peaks (different heights), due to a template dependent difference in the incorporation of the large dye chain-terminators. This problem has been significantly reduced with the introduction of new enzymes and dyes that minimize incorporation variability.This method is now used {{for the vast majority of}} sequencing reactions as it is both simpler and cheaper. The major reason for this is that the primers do not have to be separately labelled (which can be a significant expense for a single-use custom primer), although this is less of a concern with frequently used 'universal' primers. This is changing rapidly due to the increasing cost-effectiveness of second- and third-generation systems from Illumina, 454, ABI, Helicos, and Dover.|$|E

Recombinant GBV-B NS 5 B {{was reported to}} possess RdRp activity (W. Zhong et al., 2000, J. Viral Hepat. 7, 335 – 342). In this study, the GBV-B RdRp was examined more thoroughly for different RNA synthesis activities, including primer-extension, de novo initiation, template switch, terminal nucleotide addition, and template specificity. The results can be compared with previous characterizations of the HCV RdRp. The two RdRps share similarities in terms of metal ion and template preference, the abilities to add nontemplated nucleotides, perform both de novo initiation and extension from a primer, and switch templates. However, several differences in RNA synthesis between the GBV-B and HCV RdRps were observed, including (i) optimal temperatures for activity, (ii) ranges of Mn 2 + concentration tolerated for activity, and (iii) cation requirements for de novo RNA synthesis and terminal transferase activity. To assess whether the recombinant GBV-B RdRp may represent a relevant surrogate system for testing HCV antiviral agents, two compounds demonstrated to be active at nanomolar concentrations against HCV NS 5 B were tested on the GBV RdRp. A chain <b>terminating</b> <b>nucleotide</b> analog could prevent RNA synthesis, while a nonnucleoside HCV inhibitor was unable to affect RNA synthesis by the GBV RdRp...|$|E

40|$|International audienceInhibitors of the {{excision}} reaction catalyzed by HIV- 1 {{reverse transcriptase}} (RT) represent a promising {{approach in the}} fight against HIV, because these molecules would interfere with the main mechanism of resistance of this enzyme toward chain-terminating nucleotides. Only a limited number of compounds have demonstrated to inhibit this reaction to date, including nonnucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) and certain pyrophosphate analogs. We have previously found that 2 -O-galloylpunicalin (2 GP), an antiviral compound extracted from the leaves of Terminalia triflora, was able to inhibit both the reverse transcriptase and the ribonuclease H activities of HIV- 1 RT without affecting cell proliferation or viability. Herein we show that 2 GP also inhibited the ATP- and PP i}-dependent phosphorolysis catalyzed by wild-type and AZT-resistant enzymes at submicromolar concentrations. Kinetic and direct binding analysis showed that 2 GP was a noncompetitive inhibitor against the nucleotide substrate, while it competed with the binding of RT to the template/primer (K d} = 85 nM). As expected from their mechanism of action, 2 GP was active against mutations conferring resistance to NNRTIs and AZT. The combination of AZT with 2 GP was highly synergistic when tested in the presence of pyrophosphate, indicating that the inhibition of RT-catalyzed phosphorolysis was responsible for the synergy found. While other RT inhibitors that compete with the template/primer have been described, this is the first demonstration that these compounds can be used to block the excision of chain <b>terminating</b> <b>nucleotides,</b> providing a rationale for their combination with nucleoside analogs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Genomic maps of {{transcription}} factor binding sites and histone modification patterns provide unique {{insight into the}} nature of gene regulatory networks and chromatin structure. These systematic studies use microarrays to analyze the composition of DNA isolated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. To obtain quantities sufficient for microarray analysis, the isolated DNA must be amplified. Current protocols use PCR-based approaches to amplify in exponential fashion. However, exponential amplification protocols are highly susceptible to bias. Linear amplification strategies minimize amplification bias and have {{had a profound impact on}} mRNA expression analysis. These protocols have yet to be applied to the analysis of genomic DNA due to the lack of a suitable tag such as the polyA tail. Results We have developed a novel linear amplification protocol for genomic DNA. Terminal transferase is used to add polyT tails to the ends of DNA fragments. Tail length uniformity is ensured by including a limiting concentration of the <b>terminating</b> <b>nucleotide</b> ddCTP. Second strand synthesis using a T 7 -polyA primer adapter yields double stranded templates suitable for in vitro transcription (IVT). Using this approach, we are able to amplify as little as 2. 5 ng of genomic DNA, while retaining the size distribution of the starting material. In contrast, we find that PCR amplification is biased towards species of greater size. Furthermore, extensive microarray-based analyses reveal that our linear amplification protocol preserves dynamic range and species representation more effectively than a commonly used PCR-based approach. Conclusion We present a T 7 -based linear amplification protocol for genomic DNA. Validation studies and comparisons with existing methods suggest that incorporation of this protocol will reduce amplification bias in genome mapping experiments. </p...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 28 - 37). Eukaryotic transcription is a complex and highly regulated process. The adenovirus major late (AdML) promoter, a model promoter for transcription by RNA polymerase II (pol II), contains a binding site for the transcriptional activator upstream stimulatory factor (USF). Previous experiments showed that deletions in the USF site in AdML promoter decrease the stability of ATP-activated transcription complexes. As a result we wanted to look at the effect USF had on the rate of promoter clearance by pol II in vitro. To develop an assay for promoter clearance, special DNA templates were constructed such that a G at position + 11 is the only G incorporated into the growing RNA in the first 36 nucleotides of RNA synthesis. Our assay for promoter clearance is designed to measure whether pol II has passed position + 11 at a given time, t, and depends on the ability of the chain <b>terminating</b> <b>nucleotide</b> 3 '-O-methyl GTh (added at t) to quantitatively stop transcription if it is incorporated into the RNA at + 11. Controls for the promoter clearance assay are in progress. So far controls have shown the presence of promoter specific transcripts from our templates that are distinguishable from the background. In addition, 3 '-O-methyl GTP at high concentrations has been shown to terminate transcription almost completely. However, it is still not quite clear if it is efficient enough for the promoter clearance assay...|$|E

40|$|Simian virus 40 -based {{plasmids}} {{that direct}} {{the synthesis of}} preproinsulin during short-term transfection of COS cells {{have been used to}} probe the mechanism of reinitiation by eucaryotic ribosomes. Earlier studies from several laboratories had established that the ability of ribosomes to reinitiate translation at an internal AUG codon depends on having a terminator codon in frame with the preceding AUG triplet and upstream from the intended restart site. In the present studies, the position of the upstream terminator codon relative to the preproinsulin restart site has been systematically varied. The efficiency of reinitiation progressively improved as the intercistronic sequence was lengthened. When the upstream "minicistron" <b>terminated</b> 79 <b>nucleotides</b> before the preproinsulin start site, the synthesis of proinsulin was as efficient as if there were no upstream AUG codons.

40|$|We have {{constructed}} primed phi X 174 DNA templates containing either acetylated or deacetylated aminofluorene adducts at the C- 8 {{position of}} guanine. T 4 DNA polymerase <b>terminates</b> synthesis one <b>nucleotide</b> before the acetylated adducts but incorporates an additional nucleotide opposite the deacetylated guanylaminofluorene. These observations {{can be explained}} by the known preferred conformations of the acetylated and deacetylated guanosinylaminofluorene nucleosides [...] the former favoring the syn conformation (so that in DNA the guanine is displaced from the helix by the fluorene ring) and the latter preferring the anti conformation (which allows normal base pairing of the guanine with cytosine). A similar differentiation between the two adducts was found with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. In contrast, avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase, which <b>terminated</b> with a <b>nucleotide</b> inserted opposite the acetylated adducts, was less able to do so at the deacetylated adducts. The nucleoside incorporated by AMV reverse transcriptase opposite the acetylated adduct was exclusively cytidine, which suggests regular base pairing with the reacted guanosine nucleoside in the anti conformation; however, synthesis was completely blocked and unable to continue beyond this point. The differences between the termination patterns of the prokaryotic enzymes and AMV reverse transcriptase indicates that specific properties of a replicating polymerase can influence the conformation of a reacted nucleoside in the DNA, thus altering its recognition and possibly its mutagenic activity...|$|R

We have characterized the specificity of a set of region-specific antisera raised against the 5 ′-portion of ORF 1 a by immunoprecipitation of in vitro-synthesized, C-terminally truncated 1 a polypeptides and used these antisera to detect virus-specific proteins in IBV-infected Vero cells. Two antisera, which had specificity for IBV sequences from nucleotides 710 to 2079 and 1355 to 2433, respectively, immunoprecipitated a polypeptide of approximately 87 kDa from IBV-infected Veto cells.

Northern (RNA) blotting of RNA isolated from both D. vulgaris Hildenborough and Escherichia coli TG 2 transformed with plasmid pJK 29, which contains both genes on a 1. 1 -kilobase-pair SalI insert, confirms that the genes for this 14 -kDa polypeptide and rubredoxin are present on a single transcript of 680 nucleotides. Strong evidence that the 14 -kDa polypeptide is also a redox protein is provided by the fact that its NH 2 terminus is homologous to desulforedoxin, which has been isolated from D. gigas as a small dimeric redox protein (36 amino acids per monomer), coordinating two iron atoms. Since rubredoxin is a potential redox partner for the 14 -kDa protein, it has been tentatively named rubredoxin oxidoreductase, produced by the rbo gene.

40|$|Studies on genetic {{variation}} can reveal effects on traits and disease, both in humans and in model organisms. Good {{technology for the}} analysis of DNA sequence variations is critical. Currently the development towards assays for large-scale and parallel DNA sequencing and genotyping is progressing rapidly. Single base primer extension (SBE) is a robust reaction principle based on four-colour fluorescent <b>terminating</b> <b>nucleotides</b> to interrogate all four DNA nucleotides in a single reaction. In this thesis, SBE methods were applied to the analysis and discovery of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster and in humans. The tag-array minisequencing system in a microarray format is convenient for intermediate sized genotyping projects. The system is scalable and flexible to adapt to specialized and novel applications. In Study I of the thesis a tool was established to automate quality control of clustered genotype data. By calculating “Silhouette scores”, the SNP genotype assignment can be evaluated by a single numeric measure. Silhouette scores were then applied in Study I to compare the performance of four DNA polymerases and in Study III to evaluate freeze-dried reagents in the tag-array minisequencing system. The characteristics of the tag-array minisequencing system makes it suitable for inexpensive genome-wide gene mapping in the fruit fly. In Study II a high-resolution SNP map, and 293 genotyping assays, were established across the X, 2 nd and 3 rd chromosomes to distinguish commonly used Drosophila strains. A database of the SNP markers and a program for automatic allele calling and identification of map positions of mutants was also developed. The utility of the system was demonstrated by rapid mapping of 14 genes that disrupt embryonic muscle patterning. In Study III the tag-array minisequencing system was adapted to a lab-on-a-chip format for diagnostic testing for mutations in the TP 53 gene. Freeze-drying was evaluated for storing reagents, including thermo-sensitive enzymes, on the microchip to reduce the complexity of the integrated test. Correct genotyping results were obtained using freeze-dried reagents in each reaction step of the genotyping protocol, both in test tubes and in single polymer test chambers. The results showed the potential of the approach to be implemented in fully integrated systems. The four-colour chemistry of SBE has been developed further to allow massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of short DNA fragments as in the Genome Analyzer system (Solexa/Illumina). In Study IV MPS was used to compare Nimblegen arrays and the SureSelect solution-based system for targeted enrichment of 56 continuous human candidate-gene regions totalling 3. 1 Mb in size.

40|$|Many {{examples}} of internal translation initiation in eucaryotes have accumulated in recent years. In many cases terminators of upstream reading frames precede the internal initiation site, suggesting that translational reinitiation {{may be a}} mechanism for initiation at internal AUGs. To test this idea, a series of recombinants was constructed in the mammalian expression vector pSV 2. Each contained a dicistronic transcription unit comprising the coding sequence for mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) followed by the gene for xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (XGPRT) from Escherichia coli. Various versions of this pSV 2 dhfr-gpt recombinant plasmid altered the location at which the DHFR reading frame was terminated relative to the XGPRT initiation codon and demonstrated {{that this is a}} critical factor for the expression of XGPRT activity in transfected Cos- 1 cells. Thus, when the DHFR frame terminated upstream or a very short distance downstream of the XGPRT initiator AUG, substantial levels of XGPRT activity were observed. When the DHFR frame <b>terminated</b> 50 <b>nucleotides</b> beyond the XGPRT initiator, activity was reduced about twofold. However, when the DHFR and XGPRT sequences were fused in-frame so that ribosomes which initiated at the DHFR AUG did not terminate until they encountered the XGPRT terminator, production of XGPRT activity was abolished. This dependence of internal translation initiation on the position of terminators of the upstream reading frame is consistent with the hypothesis that mammalian ribosomes are capable of translational reinitiation...|$|R

Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the predicted US 4 encoded proteins of BHV- 5 /N 569 and BHV- 1 strain Schönböken (BHV- 1 /Schö) revealed 75 % identity.

When transgenic plants were infected with potato leafroll luteovirus (PLRV), which replicated the transgene-derived satRNA {{to a high}} level, the satellite sequence of the GUS:Sat transgene became densely methylated. Within the satellite region, all 86 cytosines in the upper strand and 73 of the 75 cytosines in the lower strand were either partially or fully methylated. In contrast, very low levels of DNA methylation were detected in the satellite sequence of the transgene in uninfected plants and in the flanking nonsatellite sequences in both infected and uninfected plants. Substantial amounts of truncated GUS:Sat RNA accumulated in the satRNA-replicating plants, {{and most of the}} molecules <b>terminated</b> at <b>nucleotides</b> within the first 60 bp of the satellite sequence. Whereas this RNA truncation was associated with high levels of satRNA replication, it appeared to be independent of the levels of DNA methylation in the satellite sequence, suggesting that it is not caused by methylation. All the sequenced GUS:Sat DNA molecules were hypermethylated in plants with replicating satRNA despite the phloem restriction of the helper PLRV. Also, small, sense and antisense approximately 22 nt RNAs, derived from the satRNA, were associated with the replicating satellite. These results suggest that the sequence-specific DNA methylation spread into cells in which no satRNA replication occurred and that this was mediated by the spread of unamplified satRNA and/or its associated 22 nt RNA molecules...|$|R

We are studying the mechanism of elongation arrest at this site in vitro to define the DNA sequences and proteins that determine the elongation behavior of RNA polymerase II. Our assay system consists of a nuclear extract prepared from cultured human cells. With standard reaction conditions, termination is not observed downstream of the ML promoter. However, {{in the presence of}} Sarkosyl, up to 80 % of the transcripts <b>terminate</b> 186 <b>nucleotides</b> downstream of the start site. Using this assay, we showed that the DNA sequences required to promote maximal levels of termination downstream of the ML promoter reside within a 65 -base-pair region and function in an orientation-dependent manner. To test whether elongation complexes from the ML promoter were functionally homogeneous, we determined the termination efficiency at each of two termination sites placed in tandem. We found that the behavior of the elongation complexes was different at these sites, with termination being greater at the downstream site over a wide range of Sarkosyl concentrations. This result ruled out a model in which the polymerases that read through the first site were stably modified to antiterminate. We also demonstrated that the ability of the elongation complexes to respond to the ML termination site was promoter specific, as the site did not function efficiently downstream of a heterologous promoter.

Fusion expression was abolished in a strain carrying an in-frame deletion in sigB, suggesting that sigma-B positively regulated its own synthesis, and deletions in the sigB promoter region showed that sequences identical to the sigma-B-dependent ctc promoter were essential for promoter activity. Fusion expression was greatly enhanced in a strain carrying an insertion mutation in orfX, suggesting that the 22 -kilodalton (kDa) orfX product was a negative effector of sigma-B expression or activity. Notably, the genetic organization of the sigB operon was strikingly {{similar to that of}} the B. subtilis spoIIA operon, which has the gene order spoIIAA-spoIIAB-spoIIAC, with spoIIAC encoding the sporulation-essential sigma-F. The predicted sequence of the 12 -kDa orfV product was 32 % identical to that of the 13 -kDa SpoIIAA protein, and the 18 -kDa orfW product was 27 % identical to the 16 -kDa SpoIIAB protein. On the basis of this clear evolutionary conservation, we speculate these protein pairs regulate their respective sigma factors by a similar molecular mechanism and that the spoIIA and sigB operons might control divergent branches of stationary-phase gene expression...|$|R
40|$|The hepatic uptake of bile acids {{from the}} portal {{circulation}} is primarily dependent upon a sodium-dependent basolateral membrane transporter. In order {{to begin to}} investigate the factors controlling rat liver sodium-dependent bile acid cotransporter (ntcp) gene expression, we isolated approximately 30 kilobase pairs of rat genomic DNA in three overlapping lambdaphage clones. The rat ntcp gene is distributed over 16. 5 kilobase pairs as five exons. Primer extension analysis revealed two closely spaced transcription initiation sites, 27 and 41 nucleotides downstream of a TATA sequence. Regulation of transcription was investigated first by transfection of primary rat hepatocytes {{by a series of}} 5 '-deleted rat ntcp promoter-driven luciferase constructs (from approximately - 6 kilobase pairs to - 59 base pairs of upstream sequences, <b>terminating</b> at <b>nucleotide</b> + 47), identifying a minimal promoter element: nucleotide - 158 to + 47. This minimal promoter was active in transfected HepG 2, but inactive in NIH 3 T 3, Caco- 2, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, indicating that the determinants of hepatocyte-specific expression reside within this region. The individual elements within the minimal promoter were investigated via transfection of HepG 2 cells by a series of 20 mutant plasmids, each containing a 10 -base pair sequential block mutation. Eight mutant constructs profoundly suppressed promoter activity; encompassing sequences from - 66 to + 4 nt, and + 15 to + 24 nucleotides, while no other 10 -base pair mutation significantly interfered with minimal promoter activity. Deoxyribonuclease I footprint analysis of the minimal promoter revealed three bound regions; - 92 to - 74 (footprint C), - 50 to - 37 (footprint B), and - 17 to + 12 (footprint A). Gel mobility shift assays provided evidence for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 binding within footprint A and a liver-enriched factor(s) that binds within a novel palindrome in footprint B. These studies indicate that three elements direct the ba...|$|R
40|$|In boranophosphate (BP) nucleotides, a borane (BH 3) {{group is}} {{substituted}} for a non-bridging phosphoryl oxygen {{of a normal}} phosphate group, resulting {{in a class of}} modified isoelectronic DNA and RNA mimics that can modulate the reading and writing of genetic information. 5 '-(&# 945;-P-borano) nucleoside triphosphates (NTP&# 945;Bs) are good substrates or inhibitors for many viral RNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases (RT) when compared with natural nucleoside 5 '-triphosphates (NTPs). A practical aspect of this coding phenomenon employs T 7 bacteriophage DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DdRP) to synthesize BP-modified RNA utilizing NTP&# 945;Bs as monomeric substrates. Additionally, the &# 945;-P-borano modification can be used to probe the catalytic phosphoryl transfer mechanism used by viral polymerases, and possibly enhance existing anti-viral chain <b>terminating</b> <b>nucleotides.</b> The primary goal of this dissertation is to better understand the effects of NTP&# 945;Bs on the activity of viral polymerases. In the last decade several NTP&# 945;Bs {{have been shown to be}} efficient and selective substrates for wild-type (wt) and, to a greater extent, HIV and MMLV drug-resistant viral reverse transcriptases. More recently NS 5 B, the Hepatitis C viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (HCV RdRP), is a viable target for nucleotide-based inhibition studies. Due to the similarities between the active sites of HIV-RT and HCV NS 5 B, it is therefore relevant to investigate the substrate properties of this unique modification. We investigated, for the first time, the inhibition kinetics of HCV NS 5 B&# 916; 55 RdRP by two newly synthesized NTP&# 945;B analogs: 2 '-O-methyladenosine 5 '-(&# 945;-P-borano) triphosphate (2 '-OMe ATP&# 945;B, 9 a) and 3 '-deoxyadenosine 5 '-(&# 945;-P-borano) triphosphate (3 '-dATP&# 945;B, 9 b) and the steady state incorporation kinetics of ATP&# 945;B (51 a). Our results showed that: (1) Rp- 2 '-OMe ATP&# 945;B (9 a) and Rp- 3 '-dATP&# 945;B (9 b) exhibited a 3. 5 - and 16 -fold lower IC 50 respectively when compared with natural phosphate controls, suggesting greater inhibitory potency. (2) Additionally 9 a and 9 b demonstrated a 5 - and 21 -fold lower inhibition constant (Ki) respectively when compared with the natural phosphate. Both compounds retained the competitive inhibition behavior of their parent nucleotides. (3) HCV NS 5 B&# 916; 55 preferred the Rp isomer of ATP&# 945;B (Vmax/Km = 0. 095) over the natural ATP substrate (Vmax/Km = 0. 057). None of the Sp isomers were substrates for HCV NS 5 B&# 916; 55. We further concluded that wild-type (wt) HCV NS 5 B seems to discriminate against 3 '-deoxy NTPs via lost interactions between the 3 '-OH on the ribose and the active site residues, or lost intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the 3 '-OH and the pyrophosphate leaving group during phosphoryl transfer. The overall implications of this proof of concept study are that existing viral RdRP inhibitors could be retro-fitted with the boranophosphate modification to possibly increase potency. This dissertation also explored the synthesis of anti-HIV-RT boranophosphate nucleotides which act through a chain terminating or mutagenic mechanism. 2 '- 3 '-didehydro- 2 '- 3 '-dideoxythymidine 5 '-(&# 945;-P-borano) -diphosphate (D 4 TDP&# 945;B, 30) was synthesized and later stereoselectively phosphorylated to yield the Rp-form of D 4 TTP&# 945;B (31). This was tested as a substrate in two multi-drug resistant forms of HIV-RT. Additionally, the NTP&# 945;B analogue of the mutagenic 5 -aza- 5, 6 -dihydro- 2 '-deoxycytidine (KP- 1212 -TP&# 945;B, 16) was synthesized with the eventual goal of inducing error catastrophe during viral genomic replication. Lastly we detail the extraction and purification of gemcitabine (dFdC) from Gemzar® drug mixture using a derivatization method that produced a protected form of gemcitabine nucleoside. This protected gemcitabine was then used to synthesize gemcitabine 5 '-triphosphate (dFdCTP, 42). Dissertatio...|$|R

Templates containing site-specific cis-syn and trans-syn-I thymine dimers were prepared via {{a combination of}} solid phase synthesis with photoproduct building blocks and DNA ligation. Extension of a 15 -mer primer on the UV dimer-containing templates by Pol delta produced termination and bypass products in a dNTP and PCNA dependent manner. In the absence of PCNA and at dNTP concentrations varying between 1 and 100 microM, Pol delta could not bypass the cis-syn dimer and <b>terminated</b> elongation one <b>nucleotide</b> prior to the 3 '-T of the dimer. DNA synthesis past the trans-syn-I dimer was even less efficient. In the presence of PCNA, termination occurred primarily one nucleotide prior to the 3 '-T of both dimers at 1 microM dNTPs but opposite the 5 '-T of the dimers at 100 microM dNTPs. In addition, under the latter conditions, bypass of the dimers was observed, {{to the extent of}} about 30 % of the products for the cis-syn dimer and about 15 % for the trans-syn-I dimer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAdriamycin and {{mitomycin}} C {{were reduced}} by xanthine oxidase/NADH {{in the presence}} of a DNA template comprising a stable initiated ternary transcription complex derived from the lac UV 5 promoter. Subsequent elongation of the transcription complex treated with mitomycin C revealed high levels of <b>terminated</b> transcripts one <b>nucleotide</b> prior to G residues on the coding strand (i. e. at X of XpC sequences of the non-coding strand). Lower levels of termination occurred with adriamycin, and these were also one nucleotide prior to G residues of the coding strand, but with greater sequence specificity since they were observed mainly at G of GpC sequences of the non-coding strand. The same sites were also observed with adriamycin in the absence of reducing conditions and the level of termination at these sites was enhanced up to 10 -fold by Fe 2 + and Fe 3 +, but not by Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +, Cu 2 + or Ni 2 +. These results suggest that an iron-adriamycin complex with DNA is highly sequence-specific and results in adducts, similar to those of mitomycin C, which can terminate the transcription process. Such a mechanism offers new insights into the possible mode of action of anthracyclines...|$|R
40|$|Extracellular {{nucleotides}} exert important biological {{actions in}} several cell systems. Signalling of extracellular nucleotides occurs through the activation of specific cell surface receptors. Two families of nucleotide receptors, P 2 X and P 2 Y, {{have been described}} which are associated to diverse signal transduction pathways. When activated, ionotropic P 2 X receptors (P 2 X 1 - 7) form non selective channels permeable to Ca 2 + and Na+, while metabotropic P 2 Y receptors are functionally coupled either to phospholipase C (P 2 Y 1, 2, 4, 6, and 11) or to adenylate cyclase (P 2 Y 12 - 14). The overall signalling action of nucleotides is {{under the control of}} ectonucleotidases (NTPDases), a family of enzymes that by degrading <b>nucleotides</b> <b>terminate</b> the signalling. Growing evidence shows the occurrence of extracellular nucleotides signalling in skeletal muscle. In the present work, this signalling was characterized in differentiating C 2 C 12 cells. Mechanical or electrical stimulation of C 2 C 12 myotubes produced significant release of ATP, while it was without effects in myoblasts. The ecto-ATPase activity of cells progressively increased in parallel with differentiation. Consistently, the expression level of NTPDases (1, 2 and 3 and of a-sarcoglycan) also increased. Responsiveness to nucleotides changed dramatically during differentiation, consistent with substantial changes in the expression of P 2 X and P 2 Y receptors. Nucleotide appears to stimulate proliferation of myoblasts, while the prolonged exposure to and excessive levels of ATP seems to compromise the survival of myotubes. Funded by TELETHON ITALY...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{sequencing}} by synthesis (SBS) {{offers an}} approach for potential high-throughput sequencing applications. In this method, {{the ability of}} an incoming nucleotide {{to act as a}} reversible terminator for a DNA polymerase reaction is an important requirement to unambiguously determine the identity of the incorporated nucleotide before the next nucleotide is added. A free 3 ′-OH group on the terminal nucleotide of the primer is necessary for the DNA polymerase to incorporate an incoming nucleotide. Therefore, if the 3 ′-OH group of an incoming nucleotide is capped by a chemical moiety, it will cause the polymerase reaction to <b>terminate</b> after the <b>nucleotide</b> is incorporated into the DNA strand. If the capping group is subsequently removed to generate a free 3 ′-OH, the polymerase reaction will reinitialize. We report here the design and synthesis of a 3 ′-modified photocleavable fluorescent nucleotide, 3 ′-O-allyl-dUTP-PC-Bodipy-FL- 510 (PC-Bodipy, photocleavable 4, 4 -difluoro- 4 -bora- 3 α, 4 α-diaza-s-indacene), as a reversible terminator for SBS. This nucleotide analogue contains an allyl moiety capping the 3 ′-OH group and a fluorophore Bodipy-FL- 510 linked to the 5 position of the uracil through a photocleavable 2 -nitrobenzyl linker. Here, we have shown that this nucleotide is a good substrate for a DNA polymerase. After the nucleotide was successfully incorporated into a growing DNA strand and the fluorophore was photocleaved, the allyl group was removed by using a Pd-catalyzed reaction to reinitiate the polymerase reaction, thereby establishing the feasibility of using such nucleotide analogues as reversible terminators for SBS...|$|R
40|$|A stable latent {{reservoir}} {{for human}} immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) in resting memory CD 4 + T cells presents a barrier to eradication of the infection even in patients on {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}}. Potential mechanisms for latency include inaccessibility of the integrated viral genome, absence of key host transcription factors, premature termination of HIV- 1 RNAs, and abnormal splicing patterns. To differentiate among these mechanisms, we isolated extremely pure populations of resting CD 4 + T cells from patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy. These cells did not produce virus but retained the capacity to do so if appropriately stimulated. Products of HIV- 1 transcription were examined in purified resting CD 4 + T cells. Although short, prematurely terminated HIV- 1 transcripts have been suggested as a marker for latently infected cells, the production of short transcripts had not been previously demonstrated in purified populations of resting CD 4 + T cells. By separating RNA into polyadenylated and nonpolyadenylated fractions, we showed that resting CD 4 + T cells from patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy produce abortive transcripts that lack a poly(A) tail and that <b>terminate</b> prior to <b>nucleotide</b> 181. Short transcripts dominated the pool of total HIV- 1 transcripts in resting CD 4 + T cells. Processive, polyadenylated HIV- 1 mRNAs were also present at a low level. Both unspliced and multiply spliced forms were found. Taken together, these results show that the nonproductive nature of the infection in resting CD 4 + T cells from patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy is not due to absolute blocks at the level of either transcriptional initiation or elongation but rather relative inefficiencies at multiple steps...|$|R
