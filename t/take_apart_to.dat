40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is the visual {{identity}} of the brand Staropramen analysis based on the theory of archetypes applied in marketing science. The theoretical part {{is focused on the}} archetypal theories of Jung. He marked twelve archetypes in his work, which include four main categories based on the desire they want to satisfy. The yearning for paradise: The Innocent, The Explorer and The Sage, archetypes that want to leave a thumbprint on the world: The Hero, The Outlaw and The Magician, a group that knows no man or no women is an island: The Regular Guy / Gal also known as The Everyman, The Lover and The Jester, group desiring to provide structure to the world: The Caregiver, The Creator and The Ruler. I focused on the differences between the various archetypes on one desire too, but also the on the theoretical basis of storytelling. I also wrote theoretical basiscs of semiotic analysis and summary of a research realized for my second thesis, focused on marketing communication of Staropramen. In the practical part I analyse the visual identity of the brand Staropramen, that I <b>take</b> <b>apart</b> <b>to</b> single symbols. Their importance I found in sources in the field of heraldry, mythology, botany, psychology and etymology. On the basis of identified associations I do a comparative analysis of the theoretical basis for [...] ...|$|E

Flood waters of the Snake River washed away the Old Fort Hall in 1863. Fort Hall was rebuilt in 1864, on Spring Creek just north of the original Fort Hall. The old fort was <b>taken</b> <b>apart</b> <b>to</b> construct the new fortified stage station. The following year, the site was abandoned. The Volunteer troops moved to Camp Lander until 1866.

GeoTrax is known for its Snap-Lock track which can be locked together or <b>taken</b> <b>apart</b> <b>to</b> create a multitude of track configurations. Layouts can be set up flat or using elevated tracks, and can incorporate curves, ramps and bridges. Some adult assembly is needed to build the track layouts.

50|$|Research, {{reported}} in the journal Science in September 2009, demonstrated that some new craters on Mars show exposed, pure, water ice. After a time, the ice disappears, evaporating into the atmosphere. The ice {{is only a few}} feet deep. The ice was confirmed with the Compact Imaging Spectrometer (CRISM) on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The ice was found in five locations. Three of the locations are in the Cebrenia quadrangle. These locations are 55.57° N, 150.62° E; 43.28° N, 176.9° E; and 45° N, 164.5° E. Two others are in the Diacria quadrangle: 46.7° N, 176.8° E and 46.33° N, 176.9° E.This discovery proves that future colonists on Mars will be able to obtain water {{from a wide variety of}} locations. The ice can be dug up, melted, then <b>taken</b> <b>apart</b> <b>to</b> provide fresh oxygen and hydrogen for rocket fuel. Hydrogen is the powerful fuel used by the space shuttle main engines.|$|R
5000|$|A study {{reported}} in the journal Science in September 2009, shows that some newly formed craters have excavated clean, water ice from {{just below the surface}} in five locations on Mars.

The ice was confirmed with the Compact Imaging Spectrometer (CRISM) on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The ice was found in a total of 5 locations. One of the locations (Site 5) is in the Diacria quadrangle at about 46° N, 182° E (Arcadia Planitia).This discovery is significant because it shows the presence of subsurface ice at latitudes further south than expected and proves that future colonists on Mars will be able to obtain water {{from a wide variety of}} locations.
