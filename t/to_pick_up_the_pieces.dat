5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} his father took all the family money and fled to Argentina with his mistress. Left <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces,</b> Andy sells off family heirlooms, and is upset {{that he has to}} sell the family boat for lack of any other means for his mother to support herself. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) convinces him that before he sells the boat, they should take it out for one last sunset cruise, and they drive to Stamford, Connecticut, where the boat is docked. Andy starts to hoist the main sail, but is stopped by a broker who is to sail it to the Caribbean for the buyer. With Erin's encouragement, Andy decides to take the boat to the Caribbean himself. He then finds his drunken brother Walter (Josh Groban) passed out in the liquor closet. Walter comes to and tells Andy he wanted to get the first relapse out of the way before {{checking}} into rehab. Andy invites him on the trip, saying they both need family time together and leaves, thanking Erin for her encouragement. Erin says to the camera that she would have loved to go with him if he asked. Back in the office that evening, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) asks Erin to join him for drinks, and she accepts.|$|E
25|$|Gareth Southgate's 100th game in charge, {{which saw}} Stewart Downing named captain {{for the first}} time in Emanuel Pogatetz' absence was a {{frustrating}} one. They saw two chances cleared off the line by former Middlesbrough player James Morrison, a shot hit the bar, and a penalty shout turned down as they squandered plenty of chances to beat Tony Mowbray's West Bromwich Albion. Instead, they were left <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> after a 1–0 defeat courtesy of Jonas Olsson.|$|E
25|$|The 1977–78 season, however, {{proved to}} be one that the club would prefer to forget. From {{what seemed like a}} safe mid-table {{position}} in March, Blackpool won only one of their final sixteen games and were relegated to Division Three, by one point, {{for the first time in}} their 91-year history. Brown had been sacked in February, with the club in ninth place and having scored ten goals in their previous two home games, and it was left to Jimmy Meadows once more <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> for the remaining three months of the campaign.|$|E

25|$|Frank is a wheeler-dealer {{who likes}} to {{think of himself as}} a 'big player' in the {{business}} world, but in reality he {{is little more than a}} wily conman. He is a smooth-talker and full of charm, but his actions are often thoughtless and he tends to run instead of facing up to his responsibilities, leaving his loved ones <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces.</b> His love affair with Pat Harris (Pam St. Clement) stems back to his teens, and he can never quite let her go, always breaking her heart, disappearing, and returning to break it all over again.|$|E
25|$|Dev, {{tormented by}} Paro’s wedding, has been seeking refuge in alcohol and drugs. He finds some solace with Chanda but {{is unable to}} forget Paro. While in a drug fueled haze, he calls Paro's husband {{in the middle of}} the night, she visits him at the cheap lodge where he is staying. She shows her love by taking care of him but spurns his {{attempts}} at physical intimacy. The meeting ends on a bitter note, and Paro returns to her married life. Dev resolves to go back to Chanda, but confronted by the reality of her profession, he abandons her, too. He resumes his destructive lifestyle of alcohol, drugs, and reckless behaviour. Months later, after his life has completely fallen apart and hit an all-time low, Dev attempts <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces.</b> He seeks Chanda once again and, with her help, sets out to start life afresh.|$|E
500|$|Jacqui {{has been}} {{described}} as a feisty character who is tough and hard. Holy Soap refer to her as a [...] "tough ex-con". Jacqui often takes on the matriarch role. Jacqui deals with the sisters in a different way and can get different responses from the sisters. Cooper describes her as always being there <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> for her family. She also states that Jacqui is very loyal and the most loyal character out of the McQueen family. Speaking of Jacqui's time away from forefront plots Cooper has said: [...] "I think that Jacqui's one of those characters who, if she isn't on screen for a while, it takes the audience time to warm to her again. But when they do, they find her funny, they find her interesting and I try to give them as much as I can." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{everyone}} {{finds out}} about Martha's situation, {{they try to}} stop her working in the club. Kate Ritchie who plays on-screen friend Sally Fletcher discussed how Martha would not take any advice from those closest to her and how Sally and Alf have <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> {{for her in the}} end. She compared Martha's pole dancing to many real life experiences ordinary people go through. Sally's interference made Martha's situation worse, of this Ritche added: [...] "It's been hard for Sally to realise and Alf as well, just that you just have to stand back and let it run its course and be there at the end." [...] Of Martha's downward spiral and pushing her friends away, Gordon stated: [...] "Now she's found herself in this hole, she ruined all these relationships with her family, her friends, Jack, everyone's trying to help her and she's really against everyone, she's in a really bad place at the moment".|$|E
500|$|On 21 October, {{soldiers}} again attacked an army {{barracks in}} what the New York Times said was a coup attempt against the interim government. It also cited the arrest of an unnamed dissident army captain on 27 October as the organiser of the countercoup attempt and reported that two other unnamed government critics were assaulted and left outside Bissau. Army Chief of Staff General Antonio Indjai laughed off questions {{that he was the}} power behind the throne and responded to the criticism in saying: [...] "People say I’m a drug trafficker. Anybody who has the proof, present it! We ask the international community to give us the means to fight drugs." [...] Gonzalez-Ducay then responded: [...] "I can't believe that the one who controls the drug trafficking is going to fight the drug trafficking." [...] The U.S. State Department's Foreign Service Officer for Guinea-Bissau Russell Hanks, who is not present in the country following the U.S. shutting its embassy during the Bissau-Guinean Civil War in 1998, said: [...] "You will only have an impact on this transition by engagement, not by isolation. These are the people who came in <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> after the coup." [...] His staff pointed to photographs of newly created stretches of road in a remote rural area near the Senegal border that had space for small planes to land and they suggested was {{under the supervision of the}} armed forces. Chief of Guinea-Bissau's judicial police João Biague reported on a dubious aircraft landing months before the coup near Indjai's farm. He also added that [...] "The traffickers know [...] can't do much. The agents we have in the field want to give up because they have nothing to eat." [...] Guinea-Bissau's former prosecutor general added: [...] "A country that’s not capable of discussing its own problems — it's not a country, it's not a state." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the crew}} watches a supernova, Fry puts a non-microwaveable metal [...] "Iffy Pop" [...] {{container}} into the ship's microwave. This causes a reaction between the microwave radiation and the [...] "gravitons and graviolis" [...] from the supernova, which sends {{the ship to}} 1947. Since there was no Global Positioning System in 1947, the crew has no way to accurately navigate the ship, and crash-land in Roswell, New Mexico. Refusing to wear a seat belt {{like the rest of}} the crew, Bender is catapulted out of the front of the ship by the crash and smashed to pieces. The crew and Bender's disembodied head go to seek out a way to return to their present, leaving Zoidberg behind <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces.</b> Zoidberg is captured by the U.S. military and taken to Roswell Air Base for experimentation.

2500|$|John II {{died as a}} {{prisoner}} in England and his son, Charles V was left <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces.</b> And so he did. Charles V pursued a policy of reform, including stable coinage. An edict dated 20 April 1365 established the centerpiece of this policy, a gold coin officially called the denier d’or aux fleurs de lis which had a standing figure of the king on its obverse. Its value in money of account was one livre tournois, just like the franc à cheval, and this coin is universally known as a franc à pied. In accordance with the theories of the mathematician, economist and royal advisor Nicolas Oresme, Charles struck fewer coins of better gold than his predecessors. In the accompanying deflation both prices and wages fell, but wages fell faster and debtors had to settle up in better money than they had borrowed. The Mayor of Paris, Étienne Marcel, exploited their discontent to lead a revolt which forced Charles V out of the city. The franc fared better. It became associated with money stable at one livre tournois ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{band played}} only two gigs in 1995. This allowed Duritz {{to write a}} set of songs that became the band's second album, Recovering the Satellites. [...] Released October 15, 1996, it was heavier than August and Everything After, perhaps due to the {{addition}} of second guitarist Dan Vickrey, who had joined in early 1994. A response to the sudden fame that [...] "Mr. Jones" [...] had brought, it contains lyrics such as [...] "These days I feel like I'm fading away / Like sometimes when I hear myself on the radio" [...] (from [...] "Have You Seen Me Lately?") and [...] "Gonna get back to basics / Guess I'll start it up again" [...] (from [...] "Recovering the Satellites"). Dealing with the theme of Duritz's unease with his newfound fame, the album was described as [...] "a concept album of sorts about trying <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> of a family, a social life and a psyche shattered by fame." [...] This album contained the hit single [...] "A Long December" [...] which received medium to heavy FM airplay.|$|E
