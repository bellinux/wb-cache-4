50|$|<b>Tybamate</b> (INN; Solacen, Tybatran, Effisax) is an {{anxiolytic}} of the carbamate family. It is a prodrug for meprobamate in {{the same}} way as the better known drug carisoprodol. It has liver enzyme inducing effects similar to those of phenobarbital but much weaker.|$|E
50|$|Carisoprodol, meprobamate, {{and related}} {{drugs such as}} <b>tybamate,</b> have the {{potential}} to produce physical dependence of the barbiturate type following periods of prolonged use. Withdrawal of the drug after extensive use may require hospitalization in medically compromised patients. In severe cases the withdrawal can mimic the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal including the potentially lethal status epilepticus.|$|E
50|$|In addition, some carbamates {{are used}} in human pharmacotherapy, for example, the {{acetylcholinesterase}} inhibitors neostigmine and rivastigmine, whose chemical structure {{is based on the}} natural alkaloid physostigmine. Other examples are meprobamate and its derivatives like carisoprodol, felbamate, mebutamate, and <b>tybamate,</b> a class of anxiolytic and muscle relaxant drugs widely used in the 1960s before the rise of benzodiazepines, and still used nowadays in some cases.|$|E
50|$|Marketed as a safer {{alternative}} to barbiturate anxiolytics, meprobamate (Miltown, Equanil) was {{commonly used to}} relieve anxiety in the late 1950s and 1960s. Like barbiturates, therapeutic doses produce sedation and significant overdoses may be fatal. In the US, meprobamate has generally been replaced with benzodiazepines while the drug is now withdrawn in many European countries and Canada. The muscle relaxant carisoprodol has anxiolytic effects by metabolizing to meprobamate. Various other carbamates {{have been found to}} share these effects, such as <b>tybamate</b> and lorbamate.|$|E
5000|$|Meprobamate's {{mechanism}} of action is not completely known. It {{has been shown in}} animal studies to have effects at multiple sites in the central nervous system, including the thalamus and limbic system. Meprobamate binds to GABAA receptors which interrupts neuronal communication in the reticular formation and spinal cord, causing sedation and altered perception of pain. It has been shown that meprobamate has the ability to activate currents {{even in the absence of}} GABA. [...] This relatively unique property makes meprobamate exceptionally dangerous when used in combination with other GABA-mediated drugs (including alcohol). It is also a potent adenosine reuptake inhibitor (AdoRI), which is most likely responsible for its lesser degree of sedation compared to barbiturates.Related drugs include carisoprodol and <b>tybamate</b> (prodrugs of meprobamate), felbamate, mebutamate, and methocarbamol.|$|E
40|$|Combinations of pactamycin and Salmonella typhosa 0901 endotoxin, {{administered}} simultaneously, {{killed more}} BALB/c mice than comparable doses of either agent alone The {{slopes of the}} dose-response curves for combinations of endotoxin and pactamycin were parallel to both that for endotoxin alone and the antitumor drug alone; therefore, no new mechanism of toxicity has been evoked by the combination. The synergistic toxicity of endotoxin and pactamycin was due to an in vivo interaction rather than a direct reaction between the two agents. Phenobarbital pretreatment protected the mice from toxicity of the antitumor agent alone but not from the lethal action of the combination. Pretreatment with endotoxin increased {{the resistance of the}} mice to both endotoxin alone and the combination. Third agents unable to protect mice from the synergistic toxicity of endotoxin and pactamycin were Î±[p-(fluoren- 9 -ylidenemethyl) -phenyl]- 2 -piperidine-ethanol, neomycin, phenylbutazone, polymyxin B, and <b>tybamate.</b> Prednisolone pretreatment alleviated the toxicity of the combination. For the restricted series of killed bacteria and bacterial products tested for capability to enhance the toxicity of pactamycin, only gram-negative bacterial cells were potent. These results indicated that pactamycin rendered the mice more susceptible to endotoxin and that endotoxin was the causal lethal agent...|$|E
