5|$|Clausholm Castle (1693–94) near Randers was {{designed}} by the Danish architect Ernst Brandenburger with assistance of the Swede Nicodemus Tessin who was invited to decorate the facade. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> first-floor apartments with their higher ceilings were designed for use by royalty.|$|E
5|$|Nike-X also {{considered}} a cut down version of MAR known as TACMAR. This {{was essentially a}} MAR {{with half of the}} elements hooked up, reducing its price at the cost of shorter detection range. The processing equipment was likewise reduced in complexity, lacking some of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> discrimination processing. TACMAR was designed from the start {{to be able to be}} upgraded to full MAR performance if needed, especially as the sophistication of the threat grew. MAR-II is sometimes described as the prototype TACMAR, but there is considerable confusion on this point in existing sources.|$|E
5|$|A {{bank and}} ditch {{enclosure}} {{was a simple}} form of defence, and when found without an associated motte is called a ringwork; when the site was in use for a prolonged period, it was sometimes replaced by a more complex structure or enhanced {{by the addition of}} a stone curtain wall. Building the hall in stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a wooden door. This led to the elevation of windows to the first floor– to make it harder to throw objects in– and to change the entrance from ground floor to first floor. These features are seen in many surviving castle keeps, which were <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> version of halls. Castles were not just defensive sites but also enhanced a lord's control over his lands. They allowed the garrison to control the surrounding area, and formed a centre of administration, providing the lord with a place to hold court.|$|E
50|$|The VT52 {{family was}} {{followed}} by <b>the</b> much <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> VT100 in 1978.|$|R
50|$|From {{the early}} 1930s Kihle {{typically}} used earthen colors and a primitive painting style. Later his paintings became brighter and <b>the</b> style <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Sicilian Baroque style came to {{fruition}} during a major surge of rebuilding following the massive earthquake in 1693. Previously, the Baroque style {{had been used}} on the island in a naïve and parochial manner, having evolved from hybrid native architecture rather than being derived from the great Baroque architects of Rome. After the earthquake, local architects, many of them trained in Rome, were given plentiful opportunities to recreate <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> Baroque architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy; the work of these local architects — and the new genre of architectural engravings that they pioneered — inspired more local architects to follow their lead. Around 1730, Sicilian architects had developed a confidence {{in their use of}} the Baroque style. Their particular interpretation led to further evolution to a personalised and highly localised art form on the island. From the 1780s onwards, the style was gradually replaced by the newly fashionable neoclassicism.|$|E

25|$|As {{developed}} by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> Harlequin, who became {{more of a}} romantic character. The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s.|$|E
40|$|When {{applying}} corpus linguistic {{techniques to}} historical corpora, the corpus researcher should {{be cautious about}} the results obtained. Corpus annotation techniques such as part of speech tagging, trained for modern languages, are particularly vulnerable to inaccuracy due to vocabulary and grammatical shifts in language over time. Basic corpus retrieval techniques such as frequency profiling and concordancing will also be affected, in addition to <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticate...</b>|$|R

50|$|Another {{significant}} {{difference from the}} DNS was the concept of context to name lookups, e.g. 'mail' or 'file transfer'. This made <b>the</b> NRS <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> than <b>the</b> DNS, permitting overloading of names.|$|R
25|$|The {{value of}} the Euler {{characteristic}} used to characterise polyhedra does not generalize usefully to higher dimensions, whatever their underlying topology. This inadequacy of the Euler characteristic to reliably distinguish between different topologies in higher dimensions led {{to the discovery of}} <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> Betti numbers.|$|E
25|$|The liquid drop {{model of}} the atomic nucleus predicts equal-sized fission {{products}} as an outcome of nuclear deformation. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> nuclear shell model is needed to mechanistically explain the route to the more energetically favorable outcome, in which one fission product is slightly smaller than the other. A theory of the fission based on shell model has been formulated by Maria Goeppert Mayer.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> and organized, less clandestine {{part of the}} Nazi {{machinery}} of destruction tended to murder Jews not fit for intense manual labour immediately; later in the destruction process, more and more Jews initially labelled productive were also murdered. Eventually, Nazi compulsion for the eradication of the Jews became total and absolute, with any potentially available Jews being actively sought solely {{for the purpose of}} destruction.|$|E

25|$|The {{size and}} {{building}} refinement vary noticeably among the tumuli, indicating the social ranks of their occupiers. The particularity {{of some of}} these small tumuli are the stones that crown them, which are of different colours and texture than the surrounding volcanic material. The most common ones are a simple ring of volcanic stones, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> ones are topped with turret-type stonework and were probably used to bury nobility.|$|E
25|$|The chassis of the E140 {{is based}} on the Toyota MC platform, with the E150 model {{deriving}} from the New MC platform. In other words, the Japanese market E140 carries its MC platform over from the previous E120. The versions sold in the Americas, Southeast Asia and the Middle East are based on the widened edition of this platform, so they retain the E140 designation. Models sold in Australia, Europe and South Africa use <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> New MC underpinnings, and are thus designated as E150.|$|E
25|$|Even as the Arab {{governors}} adopted <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> Iranian {{methods of}} governmental administration, non-Arabs were still prevented from holding such positions. Non-Arabs {{were not even}} allowed to wear Arabian style clothing, so strong were the feelings of Arab racial superiority cultivated by the Umayyads. Much of the discontent this caused led to the Shu'ubiyya movement, an assertion of non-Arab racial and cultural equality with Arabs. The movement gained support among Egyptians, Arameans and Berber people, though this movement was most pronounced among Iranian people.|$|E
50|$|In its {{simplest}} form, {{a harness}} {{can be made}} from a length of rope or a nylon webbing tied round <b>the</b> waist. <b>More</b> <b>sophisticated</b> harnesses exist in many patterns, designed to give greater comfort and security, and more options for carrying equipment.|$|R

25|$|Simple {{approaches}} {{compare the}} distribution of similarity scores of particular sequences and their orthologous counterparts in other species; HGT are inferred from outliers. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> DLIGHT ('Distance Likelihood-based Inference of Genes Horizontally Transferred') method considers simultaneously the effect of HGT on all sequences within groups of putative orthologs: if a likelihood-ratio test of the HGT hypothesis versus a hypothesis of no HGT is significant, a putative HGT event is inferred. In addition, the method allows inference of potential donor and recipient species and provides an estimation of the time since the HGT event.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1969 when Biba {{moved to}} its first upscale store {{on the north side}} of Kensington High Street, across from where they would later open up their {{department}} store, there was a radical change in that the clothes became more expensive and the Biba styles then appeared to be designed for more sophisticated and richer young women in their 20s. The Kensington High Street store also lost the cozy boudoir look of its predecessor, which had been so appealing to its teenage customers, and took on <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> look of the upscale Kensington/Knightsbridge designer stores.|$|E
25|$|During the Qing dynasty, {{the concept}} of Western art {{did not exist in}} Taiwan. Painting was not a highly {{respected}} occupation, and even Chinese landscape painting was undeveloped. When the Japanese began their colonization of Taiwan in 1895, they brought in a new educational system which introduced Western and Japanese art education. This not only set the basis for the future development of art appreciation in Taiwan, it also produced various famous artists. Painter and instructor Ishikawa Kinichiro contributed immensely in planning the training of new art teachers. He personally instructed students and encouraged them to travel to Japan to learn <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> techniques of art.|$|E
50|$|While it {{is likely}} that some of the canals were {{engineered}} and constructed by the local inhabitants of the Safford Basin, the Hohokam presence does suggest that Hohokam migrants may have at least in part assisted in engineering <b>the</b> later <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> canal constructions.|$|R

30|$|However, {{the present}} study {{elucidates}} {{only a part of}} the psychophysical properties of the edge-grain patterns based on MRCA.

25|$|While under Roman rule, the raw {{materials}} and manufacturing methods of northern Europe were those of the Roman tradition, using the mineral Natron. For several centuries {{after the fall of}} the Western Roman Empire, around 450 AD, recycling of Roman glass formed the major part of the local industry and glassmaking skills declined. With the rise of the Carolingian Empire in northwestern Europe approximately 800 AD, increasing demand for glass and problems with supply of traditional {{raw materials}}, together with an imperial desire to emulate <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> culture of the Islamic Empire (which was producing high quality glass) led to experimentation with new raw materials and the development of a totally new glassmaking technology.|$|E
25|$|African {{military}} {{systems to}} 1800 {{refers to the}} evolution of military systems on the African continent prior to 1800, with emphasis on the role of indigenous states and peoples. Development of the military art generally moved from the simple to <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> as economies and cultures became more elaborate. Areas such as Carthage, Egypt and Nubia are reflected in the antiquarian period. The pre-colonial period also saw a number of military systems- from cavalry empires on the grasslands, to kingdoms in more tropical and forested areas. The emergence of the gunpowder era, alongside developments in indigenous organization and culture, was to spark far-reaching consequences cutting across all regions, with ripple effects in culture, politics and economies.|$|E
25|$|Since its {{introduction}} to the U.S. market in late 2000, the XG/Azera had been a consistent seller until late 2008, when it suffered a significant drop in sales. Although there are several possible explanations for this decline, it's worth {{pointing out that the}} Hyundai Genesis sedan was introduced to the U.S. market in late 2008, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> rear-wheel drive Genesis may have cannibalized sales of the Azera. It is also noteworthy that the Hyundai Genesis sedan is considered by auto journalists to be a rival to the aforementioned full-size and near luxury vehicles that the 2012 Azera is positioned against, such as the Ford Taurus, Toyota Avalon, and Buick LaCrosse.|$|E
