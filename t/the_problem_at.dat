25|$|A {{weighted}} graph is a graph {{in which}} a number (the weight) is assigned to each edge.

Weighted correlation networks can be defined by soft-thresholding the pairwise correlations among variables (e.g. gene measurements). Such graphs arise in many contexts, for example in shortest path problems such as the traveling salesman problem.|$|E

25|$|While {{trying to}} color {{a map of}} the {{counties}} of England, Francis Guthrie postulated the four color conjecture, noting that four colors were sufficient to color the map so that no regions sharing a common border received the same color. Guthrie’s brother passed on the question to his mathematics teacher Augustus de Morgan at University College, who mentioned it in a letter to William Hamilton in 1852. Arthur Cayley raised <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> a meeting of the London Mathematical Society in 1879. The same year, Alfred Kempe published a paper that claimed to establish the result, and for a decade the four color problem was considered solved. For his accomplishment Kempe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and later President of the London Mathematical Society.|$|E
25|$|According to Fisher (1970), {{there are}} four phases of decision-making: orientation, conflict, emergence, and reinforcement. As a {{communicative}} approach, the orientation stage is where the members involved are becoming acquainted both with themselves as well as <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> hand. The conflict stage is {{where the problem is}} analyzed with several possibilities presented to resolve the problem. Upon discussing these possibilities, the emergence phase becomes known when a decision is made about which solution is to be used. The reinforcement stage is the supportive of the decision. These phases are not without objection from many theorists in the field. Morley and Stephenson (1977) claim that such a staged model of decision-making is not so rigid between phases and varies depending upon the types of decisions made.|$|E

25|$|Although ADHD has {{typically}} been conceptualized in a categorical diagnostic paradigm, it {{has also}} been proposed that this disorder should be considered within a more dimensional behavioural model that links executive functions to observed deficits. Proponents argue that classic conceptions of ADHD falsely localize <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> perception (input) rather than focusing on the inner processes involved in producing appropriate behaviour (output). Moreover, others have theorized that the appropriate development of inhibition (something that is seen to be lacking in individuals with ADHD) is essential for the normal performance of other neuropsychological abilities such as working memory, and emotional self-regulation. Thus, within this model, deficits in inhibition are conceptualized to be developmental and the result of atypically operating executive systems.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, the {{government}} liberalised most prices to combat widespread product shortages, and {{was successful in}} overcoming <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, {{the government}} continued to subsidise state-run industries and agriculture by uncovered monetary emission. The loose monetary policies of the early 1990s pushed inflation to hyperinflationary levels. For the year 1993, Ukraine holds the world record for inflation in one calendar year. Those living on fixed incomes suffered the most. Prices stabilised only after {{the introduction of new}} currency, the hryvnia, in 1996. The country was also slow in implementing structural reforms. Following independence, the government formed a legal framework for privatisation. However, widespread resistance to reforms within the government and from {{a significant part of the}} population soon stalled the reform efforts. A large number of state-owned enterprises were exempt from the privatisation process.|$|E
25|$|In a population, at most half have values {{strictly}} {{less than}} the median and at most half have values strictly greater than it. If each group contains {{less than half the}} population, then some of the population is exactly equal to the median. For example, if a<nbsp&bnbsp&<nbsp&c, then the median of the list {a,nbsp&b,nbsp&c} is b, and, if anbsp&<nbsp&bnbsp&<nbsp&cnbsp&<nbsp&d, then the median of the list {a,nbsp&b,nbsp&c,nbsp&d} is the mean of b and c; i.e., it is (bnbsp&+nbsp&c)/2. Indeed, as {{it is based on the}} middle data in a group, it is not necessary to even know the value of extreme results in order to calculate a median. For example, in a psychology test investigating the time needed to solve a problem, if a small number of people failed to solve <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> all in the given time a median can still be calculated.|$|E

25|$|In 1992 {{an affirmative}} action {{requirement}} {{was introduced to}} ensure {{that at least one}} third of each University's contingent must be female, unless the circumstances could be justified. This was prompted by the poor representation of female debaters at Australs. In 1990 only 8% of all speakers eligible to make the finals at Australasian championships were female, although women were over-represented as adjudicators. In 1991, the year before the introduction of the affirmative action requirement, the first women's meeting was held to discuss ways to combat <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> <b>At</b> that time the participation rate had risen to 21%, with the introduction of a number of universities as first-time participants. Few women were represented in the finals, however. The intention behind the introduction of the rule was that it would encourage universities to promote debating to a large number of potential members and train their debaters before they attended Australs. It was also thought that this would encourage a greater diversity of speaking styles, rather than what was seen as a very aggressive style by a number of very successful and talented Australian male debaters, and this would benefit all debaters and universities.|$|E
