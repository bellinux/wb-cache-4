5|$|In 2016 {{there were}} 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were {{operated}} {{by the government and}} 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade.
