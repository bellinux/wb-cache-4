While they find the device works with inanimate objects, the living creatures <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> on always seem to die. When Dr. Patricia Hill (Mary Peach) arrives, she helps them fix the error, making Steiner think the problem has been solved. Meanwhile, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Wooland), Steiner's boss and head of the institute he works for, is being blackmailed by Mr. Latham (Derrick De Marney), who wants credit for Steiner's discovery. He forces Blanchard to demand Steiner to give a premature presentation to Professor Lembach (Gerard Heinz).|$|E
5|$|The Ravagers and Quill's group {{join with}} the Nova Corps {{to confront the}} Dark Aster at Xandar, with Quill's group {{breaching}} the Dark Aster with the Milano. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Gamora fights and defeats Nebula, who then escapes, but the group find themselves outmatched by Ronan's power until Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the Dark Aster. The damaged Dark Aster crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> to destroy Ronan.|$|E

5|$|The game's setting {{stemmed from}} the idea of players being able to create and control a group of obedient creatures. The Shapers and the world of Geneforge were the result of Vogel imagining how would a being possess such power and how would <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>it.</b> The game's setting, a mixture of science fiction and fantasy, differs from the pure science fiction setting the game had been envisioned as. Vogel had {{difficulties}} balancing gameplay with the powerful directed-energy weapons players would expect to use in a science fiction game. Sales exceeded the developer's expectations, despite fears that the departure from Spiderweb's Avernum series would deter players. Geneforge received a positive reception from reviewers, despite the quality of the graphics being rated as poor and the game containing one piece of music, the title theme. The plot and setting were praised by reviewers for uniqueness and detail.|$|E
5|$|Becky reveals to Steve that Hooch arrested her for {{shoplifting}} {{when she}} was fifteen, and attempted to molest her. She filed a complaint against him at the time, and Hooch is determined to get his revenge as this harmed his promotion prospects. During Becky's trial, Steve develops genuine feelings for her and they begin an affair, with Steve promising to leave Michelle. Although he keeps his promise, Becky reunites with Jason, eventually leading to him proposing to her. She accepts but reconsiders when Steve proposes as well.

Slug plants drugs on Becky. At Becky and Steve's 2nd wedding, the reception is raided by police, and Becky is arrested for drug possession. Steve hires lawyers to free Becky and after Steve and Becky find Slug and convince him {{to tell them what}} Hooch has on him that he would even consider framing Becky, <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> to blackmail Hooch into calling a truce and drop the charges.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, {{one of the}} sub {{contractors}} of Bouygues fell under criticism for the dumping of tunnel fill on sensitive wetlands on Virginia Key. They {{were supposed to be}} dumping the fill on Virginia Key on the degraded northwest side, but were found dumping it 80 to 100 yards (73.1 to 94.5 m) from the designated spot, where they damaged wetlands and killed about 40 mangrove trees with a piece of equipment that got stuck. The intention was that they would be allowed to put 55,000 cubic yards (42,050.5 m3) of fill there provided that <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> to build a berm to block the view of Virginia Key's sewage water treatment plant. The fill that was dumped on Virginia Key was mainly rock and soil from road construction and site preparation on Watson Island and not from tunnel boring, which environmentalists object being put on Virginia Key as it may not be as clean. The north point of Virginia Key {{is one of the last}} remaining undeveloped areas near the Miami downtown area and has been recently restored as it was previously used as a dumping site for the infill from the Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami Marine Stadium, and Norris Cut.|$|E

Snake and EVA travel to a lake, where a WIG ground effect vehicle is hidden. Before <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> to escape the region, Snake confronts his old mentor, The Boss, whom he must assassinate to complete his mission. After an emotional battle, The Boss gives Snake the microfilm containing the location of the Philosopher's Legacy, and requests Snake to kill her. Soon after, Snake overcomes his feelings and kills The Boss, emerging victorious. He and EVA escape to Alaska, and spend the night together as they make love. During the night, EVA disappears with the microfilm, and leaves behind a tape revealing herself to be a Chinese spy sent to steal the Philosopher's Legacy for China. The tape continues, and EVA reveals that The Boss did not defect to the Soviet Union; rather, she was under orders to pretend to defect so she could infiltrate Volgin's ranks and find the location of the Legacy, which could be brought back to America. The final part of her mission was to sacrifice her honor and die at the hands of Snake, under the guise of a traitor, to prove the U.S.'s innocence in Volgin's nuclear attack during the Virtuous Mission.|$|E

In the present, Itsuki encounters Tsubasa at the One of Millennium talent audition event, where she is hoping to begin her career as an idol. The compare is possessed by a hostile Mirage, and everyone in the building apart from Itsuki and Tsubasa is stripped of their Performa. Itsuki follows Tsubasa into the Idolasphere, and both are attacked by hostile Mirages. Awakening to their Performa, <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> to cleanse the Mirages: their attackers are revealed to be Chrom and Caeda, who ally respectively with Itsuki and Tsubasa. With help from Touma, who is the Mirage Master to Cain, the party free the compare from the hostile Mirage's control. Leaving the Idolasphere, they encounter Maiko, who offers them positions alongside Touma in Fortuna Entertainment so they can both forward their entertainment careers and help fight Mirage attacks alongside Kiria and her Mirage Tharja. They are aided by Tiki, who is suffering from amnesia similar to the other allied Mirages.|$|E

25|$|The Express Pass, {{introduced}} in season 17, is given as a prize {{on an early}} leg of the race (usually the first leg, though it was awarded on the second leg of season 21 and offered on the second leg of season 25, and awarded on the sixth leg (to {{be used by the}} end of the ninth) of season 28). It allows the team to skip any single task (including Roadblocks, Detours, and miscellaneous tasks, but not the Fast Forward task), once, during the race. The choice of which task to skip is at the team's discretion, but the power, if unused, expires at the end of Leg 8. The Express pass has since appeared in the Latin American edition as the Pase Directo (following the change production companies in season three) and in the Norwegian version as the Fripass. For season 22, the leg 1 prize was two Express Passes; however, the team that won them could only use one of them and had to relinquish the second Express Pass to another team before the end of the fourth leg, and for season 23 and season 24 they need to relinquish the second Express Pass to another team before the end of the fifth leg. In season 25, the Express Pass was given out in an optional task right before the Pit Stop, allowing any team to possibly win it rather than it being a definite award for a first-place finish on the leg. In season 27, the team that won the Express Pass must use the Express Pass before the fifth leg and must give the Express Pass to another team at the leg after <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>it,</b> and the team who received the Express Pass must use the Express Pass on the next leg.|$|E

Nymphotomia was a medical operation to excise an unusually large clitoris, but what was considered [...] "unusually large" [...] was often a matter of perception. The procedure was routinely performed on Egyptian women, due to physicians such as Jacques Daléchamps who believed that this version of the clitoris was [...] "an unusual feature that occurred in almost all Egyptian women [...] some of ours, so that when they find themselves in the company of other women, or their clothes rub them while they walk or their husbands wish to approach them, it erects like a male penis and indeed <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> to play with other women, as their husbands would do...
