5|$|Homer, {{who still}} wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to come with him. He races through a swamp, accidentally killing the state's most famous {{resident}} and reptile – an alligator named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier while Homer made a fool of himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives {{on the scene and}} despite the fact that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family members flee from the sheriff and during a car chase they are hit by a train that pushes their car on the rail for several miles. When the Simpsons get off of the rail, they escape to a restaurant where they are given employment. <b>They</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks them down and kidnaps them while they are sleeping. For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working at a party held by a judge in front of the capitol, tending to the guests (and failing to escape), Captain Jack strolls out of the capitol's doors. It turns out that he was never dead but rather knocked out. The family is acquitted, though they are banned from entering the state of Florida again (and several other states, excluding Arizona and North Dakota).|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the humor}} of The Order of the Stick {{is based on}} roleplaying games (particularly the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition ruleset), with {{characters}} freely discussing game mechanics, such as experience points, skill sets, and random encounters. The characters {{know very well that}} <b>they</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> world controlled by the rules of roleplaying games, but attempt to function normally within it, often with nonsensical results. Characters have been shown browsing through rulebooks for the D game to select a certain monster for use, or to learn about a new class. Common techniques of players and Dungeon Masters are spoofed, such as the weather of the campaign world changing to herald a dramatic encounter, or a player who does not bother to complete the details of his character's backstory. Burlew's satirical humor addresses many of the clichés of the fantasy genre as a whole, often by twisting them in new and different ways.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a variety}} of {{findings}} contradict {{the claims of the}} social activity hypothesis. Firstly, it was found that extraverts were happier than introverts even when alone. Specifically, extraverts tend to be happier regardless of whether they live alone or with others, or whether <b>they</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> vibrant city or quiet rural environment. Similarly, a study by Diener, Sandvik, Pavot, and Fujita (1992) showed that although extraverts chose social jobs relatively more frequently (51%) than nonsocial jobs compared to introverts (38%), they were happier than introverts regardless of whether their occupations had social or nonsocial character. Secondly, it was found that extraverts only sometimes reported greater amounts of social activity than introverts, but in general extraverts and introverts do not differ in the quantity of their socialization. Similar finding was reported by Srivastava, Angelo, and Vallereux (2008), who found that extraverts and introverts both enjoy participating in social interactions, but extraverts participate socially more. Thirdly, studies have shown that both extraverts and introverts participate in social relations, but that the quality of this participation differs. The more frequent social participation among extraverts could be {{explained by the fact that}} extraverts know more people, but those people are not necessarily their close friends, whereas introverts, when participating in social interactions, are more selective and have only few close friends with whom they have special relationships.|$|E
25|$|Professor Katarina Sjöberg {{argues in}} The Wall Street Culture {{that within the}} media {{negative}} images of Wall Street are painted {{in terms of the}} district's market falls, money losses and deceitful gains. However, this is not what Wall Street investors are bothered by. Instead, it is the public's words and opinions which they feel mold their image. Sjöberg notes that in the American culture, money making is of utmost importance and knowing how to make money is considered to be respectable. Therefore, Wall Street investors prioritize their work as well as strive to climb the corporate ladder. They also feel obligated to maintain the image the public creates, because it strengthens their position as a Wall Street employee. They value seeing themselves as experts in their field, especially since <b>they</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> society that values wealth. This justifies their acts of greed, and allows them to take part in activities often deemed as criminal because they feel as though it is expected. Moreover, they do not regret their actions because to them, it is part of being an American. Aside from living up to the public's image, Wall Street workers justify their high salaries with an argument pointed out by Karen Ho in Disciplining Investment Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis, the Downsizing of Corporate America. She argues that {{due to the fact that}} the financial market is volatile in conjunction with the existence of job insecurity, Wall Street workers are compensated through their salaries.|$|E

500|$|Many {{studies have}} been done to {{investigate}} the division of household labor within couples, and more specifically, on the gender roles played by a variety of people worldwide. According to The State of the World's Children 2007, women generally work longer hours than men regardless if <b>they</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> developed or developing country. Most studies found that when both parents are faced with a full-time job, women are faced with a higher amount of a domestic workload than men. According to the World Bank Latin American and Caribbean Studies, Mexican women in the labor force still spend approximately 33hours each week performing household responsibilities. In contrast, husbands only contribute approximately 6hours each week. Even more striking, [...] "daughters contribute 14hours weekly helping their mothers, while sons spend the same time as their fathers (that is, 5–6hours weekly)." ...|$|E

500|$|Kohn {{regarded}} its visuals as {{the pinnacle}} of the show. Sava wrote {{that the notion of}} time being a flat circle could have inspired the circular shape of the inner frame. He noted the use of color beyond the circle as a way to convey the many emotions evoked for the whole of the episode. Ignoring this device, Sava saw its use as humorous diversions while it contributed to the splendor. Nussbaum described the creatures appearing in the outer frame as annotative and a mute chorus, suggesting <b>they</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> parallel universe of both connection and isolation. The episode was later released on DVD twice, first in the year of that broadcast, as part of the Princess Day box set, and later in 2015, as part of a box set for the complete fifth season. Home video critic Justin Remer called [...] "Bad Timing" [...] "surprisingly devastating" [...] in DVD Talk. Kohn summed up the episode's climax as the [...] of Adventure Time.|$|E
500|$|The {{department}} of Ariege {{is known for}} the annual transhumance (seasonal migration) of cattle, sheep and horses, including {{many members of the}} Mérens breed. Each year, in June, hundreds of horses are moved to summer pastures at around [...] in altitude, where <b>they</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> semi-feral state, traveling on steep mountain paths and weathering storms and other climactic variations. In October, they return to the valleys for the winter. An old tradition, the transhumance fell out of favor, but has been reintroduced to Ariege by the association Autrefois en Couserans. Since 2000, the association has worked with local horse breeders to promote the return to the annual practice. Around 500 Mérens make the transhumance each year. Herds are usually led by an experienced mare marked with a bell, as is done with cattle. A stallion can accompany the mares with foals to maintain cohesion of the herd and prevent it from mixing with other herds on the mountain slopes. The behavior of transhumant herds is midway between that of feral horses and domesticated horses who are around humans year-round. Some horses, raised high in the mountains, stay there year-round and do not perform the transhumance.|$|E
500|$|Amidst {{the fourth}} season, the romance between Dan and Blair became a {{polarizing}} topic among viewers which also drew significant media interest. Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post applauded the development, feeling that Blair had [...] "more chemistry" [...] with Dan than with Chuck. New York magazine's Chris Rovzar called Blair and Dan's story line [...] "believable", citing their common ground {{in education and}} taste. Rovzar further stated, [...] "Since <b>they</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> world where both only seem to have half a dozen real friends (if that), is it so crazy they'd end up together?" [...] An article from The Huffington Post declared that [...] "Dan and Blair together are like Harry Burns and Sally Albright reincarnated — the couple was obviously inspired by When Harry Met Sally." [...] It further commented that the couple paralleled Pacey and Joey’s relationship from Dawson's Creek and concluded that Dan and Blair were [...] "the most inspired storyline and couple of the show". Entertainment Weekly stated that Dan and Blair were like stars in an [...] "updated version of You've Got Mail".

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{hospice care}} can {{alleviate}} suffering {{at the end}} of life for patients with cancer, it remains underutilized, particularly by African Ameri-cans and Hispanics. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the racial composi-tion of the census tract where an individual resides is associated with hospice use. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results–Medicare file for individ-uals dying from breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer (n= 70, 669). MEASUREMENTS: Hospice use during the 12 months before death. RESULTS: Hospice was most commonly used by indivi-duals who <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> areas with fewer African-American and Hispanic residents (47 %), and was least commonly used by individuals who <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> areas with <b>a</b> high percentage of African-American and Hispanic residents (35 %). His-panics (odds ratio 0. 51, 95 % confidence interval 0. 29 – 0. 91) and African Americans (0. 56, 0. 44 – 0. 71) were less likely to use hospice if <b>they</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> census tract with a high percentage of both AfricanAmericans andHispanics than if <b>they</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> low minority tract. African Amer-icans and whites were less likely to receive hospice care if <b>they</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> census tract with a high percentage of Hispanics than if <b>they</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> low minority area. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing hospice use may require interventions to improve the delivery of hospice care in minority communities...|$|R
500|$|A {{section of}} critics {{wrote on the}} {{relevance}} of the movie to the current times. In an interview, Gatlif stated that he wanted the movie to mirror the current times, adding that the times have not changed much, and that while the political extermination has gone, the psychological and political views of Romani have not. He criticised the French law that allows wanderers to stay in one place only for 24 hours. He was also critical of the plight of Romani in Hungary, Romania and Italy. He went on that the state of the Romani now in many places, [...] "with the rows of homeless people waiting for a bowl of soup with a tin can on their hands", is not very different from that in the concentration camps. Gatlif also lashed out against the fact that until 1969, Romani were required to have their papers stamped at a police station or city hall whenever they arrived at or left a French village. Bob Hill at Moving Pictures Network remarked that the movie draws parallels to the fact that [...] "we are once again veering toward a culture in which regimes and wealth determine who has the right to live free — and who has no rights at all", and cited present happenings such as the developments in the Middle East, racial wars and inter-country disputes. It added that the movie makes the audience ask themselves if <b>they</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> society that embraces or condemns diversity.|$|E
