He was best known, however, for his studio re-creations of road games—a common practice in the 1930s, when line charges were too expensive for live road coverage. The radio listeners would hear the click of the ticker <b>tape</b> <b>code</b> for HR, and the announcer would convey, [...] "It's a long fly ball to deep center, going,going ....... gone.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{demonstrate}} {{the feasibility of}} directly surveying adolescents {{about the content of}} preventive health services they have received and to assess the validity of adolescent self-reported recall. DATA SOURCES/SETTING: Audiotaped encounters, telephone interviews, and chart reviews with 14 - 21 year olds being seen for preventive care visits at 15 pediatric and family medicine private practices, teaching hospital clinics, and health centers. DESIGN: 537 adolescents presenting for well visits were approached, 400 (75 percent) consented, 374 (94 percent) were audiotaped, and 354 (89 percent) completed telephone interviews either two to four weeks or five to seven months after their visits. Audiotapes were coded for screening and counseling across 34 preventive service content areas. Intraobserver reliability (Cohen's kappa) ranged from 0. 45 for talking about peers to 0. 94 for discussing tobacco. The sensitivity and specificity of the adolescent self-reports were assessed using the audiotape coding as the gold standard. RESULTS: Almost all adolescents surveyed (94 percent) remembered having had a preventive care visit, 93 percent identified the site of care, and most (84 percent) identified the clinician they had seen. There was wide variation in the prevalence of screening, based on the <b>tape</b> <b>coding.</b> Adolescent self-report was moderately or highly sensitive and specific at two weeks and six months for 24 of 34 screening and counseling items, including having discussed: weight, diet, body image, exercise, seatbelts, bike helmet use, cigarettes/smoking, smokeless tobacco, alcohol, drugs, steroids, sex, sexual orientation, birth control, condoms, HIV, STDs, school, family, future plans, emotions, suicidality, and abuse. Self-report was least accurate for blood pressure/cholesterol screening, immunizations, or for having discussed fighting, violence, weapon carrying, sleep, dental care, friends, or over-the-counter drug use. CONCLUSION: Adolescents' self-report of the care they have received is a valid method of determining the content of preventive health service delivery. Although recall of screening and counseling is more accurate within two to four weeks after preventive care visits, adolescents can report accurately on the care they had received five to seven months after the preventive health care visits occurred...|$|R

Parent-infant/toddler interactions related strongly to early literacy skills of receptive vocabulary, symbolic representation, and phonemic analysis, but not to rhyming or alliteration skills.

50|$|The {{first was}} the {{invention}} of time code.

A time code reader device translated this signal into hours, minutes, seconds and frames, originally displayed on a Nixie tube display, and later with LED readouts. This innovation made it possible for the editor to note the exact frames at which to make a cut, and thus be much more precise. He could create a paper edit by writing down the numbers of the first and last frames of each shot, and then arrange them in order on paper prior to the actual edit session with the expensive VTRs.|$|R

After each participant reviewed a vignette, she or he was asked questions about the vignette in order to discover participant???s levels of familiarity with common mental health conditions (i. e. mentally healthy conditions, depression, schizophrenia, alcohol dependence and substance-related disorders).

Participants' reactions to the videos were <b>taped</b> and <b>coded</b> for mimicry. They also rated their own level of happiness after both the sad and happy stories. In partial confirmation of the hypothesis, results showed that for sad emotions, disliking the target caused significantly less mimicry than feeling neutral about the target while liking the target caused significantly more contagion than feeling neutral about the target However, contrary to the hypothesis, those who felt neutral mimicked the most and felt the least contagion.
