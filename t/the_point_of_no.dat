5|$|Another {{reason for}} the gradual decline in the {{development}} of Sicily's Baroque and building in general was that the money was running out. During the 17th century, the aristocracy had lived principally on their landed estates, tending and improving them, and as a result their income also increased. During the 18th century, the nobility gradually migrated towards the cities, in particular Palermo, to enjoy the social delights of the Viceroy's court and Catania. Their town palazzi grew in size and splendour, {{to the detriment of the}} abandoned estates, which were still expected to provide the revenue. The land agents left to run the estates over time became less efficient, or corrupt, often both. Consequently, aristocratic incomes fell. The aristocracy borrowed money using the estates as surety, until the value of the neglected estates fell below the money borrowed against them. Moreover, Sicily was by now as unstable politically as its nobility were financially. Ruled from Naples by the weak Ferdinand IV and his dominant wife, Sicily had declined to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> return long before 1798 and again in 1806 when the King was forced by the invading French to flee Naples to Sicily. The French were kept at bay from Sicily only by an expeditionary force of 17,000 British troops, and Sicily was now ruled by Britain in effect if not in name. King Ferdinand then in 1811 imposed the first taxes, at a single stroke alienating his aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with this}} information, Master Chief and Cortana decide to destroy Halo to prevent its activation. While {{fighting}} the Flood, the Covenant, and Guilty Spark's Sentinels, Cortana discovers {{that the best}} way to accomplish this is to cause the crashed Pillar of Autumn to self-destruct. However, Captain Keyes' authorization is required to destroy the Autumn, forcing the Chief and Cortana to return to the now-Flood-infested Truth and Reconciliation to search for him. By the time they reach Keyes, however, he has been infected beyond <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> return by the Flood. Master Chief retrieves Keyes' neural implants directly from his brain and retreats to the Autumn, where Cortana activates the ship's self-destruct sequence. However, 343 Guilty Spark reappears and deactivates the countdown, discovering the record of human history in the process. Master Chief manually destabilizes the Pillar of Autumns fusion reactors, and he and Cortana narrowly escape the destruction of the ring via a fighter. Cortana scans nearby space and finds that they are apparently the only survivors. Cortana justifies the sacrifices of the other humans on Halo, stating that they had no choice due to the threat posed by Halo, the Covenant and the Flood. Cortana believes it's over but the Master Chief tells her that they're just getting started.|$|E

25|$|Byron {{spent time}} in Albania and Greece, {{organizing}} funds and supplies (including the provision of several ships), but died from fever at Missolonghi in 1824. Byron's death helped to create an even stronger European sympathy for the Greek cause.

25|$|The {{situation}} in Hungary took {{a sharp turn}} for the worse immediately after the celebrated victory over the Turks. The victorious commanders, including János Hunyadi, died of plague, Ulrich of Celje was murdered, and even the young King Ladislaus died suddenly the following year. The aged Đurađ Branković also died, his despotate passing to his son Lazar. Realizing that Hungary was drastically weakened and that he had crossed <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> return by refusing the Sultan's demands, Thomas decided to step forward to head the Christian coalition. In August 1456, Ragusa received an information from the King in the utmost secrecy: he was intent on declaring war on the Turks. He was far from capable of succeeding, and even suffered a Turkish raid in the beginning of 1457.|$|E
25|$|At 9:07 Moscow Time Osoaviakhim-1 {{lifted off}} and soon made radio {{contact with the}} airfield. By 9:56 the {{aircraft}} reached 15,000 metres according to on-board altimeter; at around 17,700 metres its envelope expanded into a nearly perfect sphere and eventually reached static equilibrium at 19,500 metres, exactly as intended by design. The crew experienced problems with carbon dioxide absorbers, but {{it appeared to be}} manageable. Fedoseenko dumped 310 kilograms of ballast and by 10:50 the balloon passed its design altitude of 20,500 metres. This moment was later marked as <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> return: at 20,500 metres Osoaviakhim-1 carried just enough ballast to stabilize descent speed. Further ascent and inevitable loss of hydrogen made this ballast insufficient; the only escape route was through bailing out on personal parachutes, provided that the crew could open the awkward hatch. After nearly an hour at 20,600 metres Osoaviakhim-1 climbed again, reaching 22,000 metres at 12:33 and hovered at this record altitude for 12 minutes.|$|E

The review concluded: [...] "The book is sometimes predictable and psychologically simplistic, but Dickinson {{comes across as}} a triumphant survivor. Her willingness to recognize her own flaws makes it easy to relate to her positive message and should inspire readers searching for solutions to career and personal conflicts." [...] The review praised the author's ability at being: [...] "honest enough to acknowledge the stimulating aspects of success and glamour, explaining why they lure insecure personalities and imprison them past <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> return."

[...] Lyrically, according to Birgisson, the song carries some feminine viewpoints that Sheyne had managed to incorporate through her contribution. Ben Graham, the author of Maximum Jessica Simpson, noted that the lyrics suggest that Simpson finds it hard to keep her famous virginity image intact.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a simple {{model of a}} non-autonomous system with a time dependent parameter p(τ) and its corresponding "dynamic" (time-dependent) saddle-node bifurcation. We show that <b>the</b> actual <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> return for a system undergoing a critical transition can be significantly delayed {{in comparison to the}} breaking time τ̂ at which the corresponding autonomous system with a time-independent parameter p_a= p(τ̂) undergoes a bifurcation. A dimensionless parameter α=λ p_ 0 ^ 3 V^- 2 is introduced, in which λ is the curvature of the autonomous saddle-node bifurcation according to parameter p(τ), which has an initial value of p_ 0 and a constant rate of change V. We find that the breaking time τ̂ is always less than <b>the</b> actual <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> return τ^* after which the critical transition is irreversible; specifically, the relation τ^*-τ̂≃ 2. 338 (λ V) ^- 1 / 3 is analytically obtained.
