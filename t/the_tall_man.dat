5|$|Nouns {{can form}} noun phrases (NPs) {{where they are}} the {{syntactic}} head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives. Noun phrases can be short, such as the man, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. red, tall, all) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. the, that). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> <b>man</b> with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit. For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in The President of India's wife, where the enclitic follows India and not President.|$|E

25|$|Connery began {{bodybuilding}} {{at the age}} of 18, {{and from}} 1951 trained heavily with Ellington, a former gym instructor in the British army. While his official website claims he was third in the 1950 Mr. Universe contest, most sources place him in the 1953 competition, either third in the Junior class or failing to place in <b>the</b> <b>Tall</b> <b>Man</b> classification. Connery stated that he was soon deterred from bodybuilding when he found that the Americans frequently beat him in competitions because of sheer muscle size and, unlike Connery, refused to participate in athletic activity which could make them lose muscle mass.|$|E

5000|$|Consider the {{sentence}} [...] "Jana {{wants to marry}} <b>the</b> <b>tallest</b> <b>man</b> in Fulsom County". It could be read either de dicto or de re; the meanings would be different. One interpretation is that Jana wants to marry <b>the</b> <b>tallest</b> <b>man</b> in Fulsom County, whoever he might be. On this interpretation, what the statement tells us is that Jana has a certain unspecific desire; what she desires is that a certain situation should obtain, namely, Jana's marrying <b>the</b> <b>tallest</b> <b>man</b> in Fulsom County. The desire is directed at that situation, regardless of how {{it is to be}} achieved. The other interpretation is that Jana wants to marry a certain man, who in fact happens to be <b>the</b> <b>tallest</b> <b>man</b> in Fulsom County. Her desire is for that man, and she desires herself to marry him. Again, the first interpretation, [...] "Jana desires that she marry <b>the</b> <b>tallest</b> <b>man</b> in Fulsom County", is the de dicto interpretation. The second interpretation, [...] "Of <b>the</b> <b>tallest</b> <b>man</b> in Fulsom County, Jana desires that she marry him", is the de re interpretation.|$|R

500|$|Knudsen was {{inspired}} to create the Slender Man primarily by Zack Parsons' [...] "That Insidious Beast", Stephen King's The Mist, reports of shadow people, Mothman and the Mad Gasser of Mattoon. [...] Other inspirations for the character were <b>the</b> <b>Tall</b> <b>Man</b> from the 1979 film Phantasm, H. P. Lovecraft, the surrealist work of William S. Burroughs, and the survival horror video games Silent Hill and Resident Evil. Knudsen's intention was [...] "to formulate something whose motivations can barely be comprehended, and [...] unease and terror in a general population." [...] Other pre-existing fictional or legendary creatures which {{are similar to the}} Slender Man include: the Gentlemen, black-suited, pale, bald demons from the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode [...] "Hush"; Men in black, many accounts of which grant them an uncanny appearance with an unnatural walk and [...] "oriental" [...] features; and The Question, a DC Comics superhero with a blank face, whose secret identity is [...] "Victor Sage", a name similar to Knudsen's alias [...] "Victor Surge".|$|E
500|$|Author Garry Wills {{believed}} that Davis was generally underrated {{as an actress}} because her constrained part in Hellcats was her most widely seen performance. In addition, Davis downplayed her Hollywood goals: promotional material from MGM in 1949 said that her [...] "greatest ambition" [...] {{was to have a}} [...] "successful happy marriage"; decades later, in 1975, she would say, [...] "I was never really a career woman but [...] only because I hadn't found the man I wanted to marry. I couldn't sit around and do nothing, so I became an actress." [...] Ronald Reagan biographer Lou Cannon nevertheless characterized her as a [...] "reliable" [...] and [...] "solid" [...] performer who held her own in performances with better-known actors. After her final film, Crash Landing (1958), Davis appeared for a brief time as a guest star in television dramas, such as the Zane Grey Theatre episode [...] "The Long Shadow" [...] (1961), where she played opposite Ronald Reagan, as well as Wagon Train and <b>The</b> <b>Tall</b> <b>Man,</b> until she retired as an actress in 1962.|$|E
