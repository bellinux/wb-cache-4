60|$|When I had <b>trued</b> {{my course}} by the {{landmarks}} {{and with the}} compass lit by the Tiny my electric light in the dark box, I had time to look about me. All seemed quite dark wherever I looked--to land, or sea, or sky. But darkness is relative, and though each quarter and spot looked dark in turn, there was not such absolute darkness as a whole. I could tell the difference, for instance, between land and sea, {{no matter how far}} off we might be from either. Looking upward, the sky was dark; yet there was light enough to see, and even distinguish broad effects. I had no difficulty in distinguishing the Tower towards which we were moving, and that, after all, was the main thing. We drifted slowly, very slowly, as the air was still, and I only used the minimum pressure necessary for the engine. I think I now understood {{for the first time the}} extraordinary value of the engine with which my Kitson was equipped. It was noiseless, it was practically of no weight, and it allowed the machine to progress as easily as the old-fashioned balloon used to drift before a breeze. Teuta, who had naturally very fine sight, seemed to see even better than I did, for as we drew nearer to the Tower, and its round, open top began to articulate itself, she commenced to prepare for her part of the task. She it was who uncoiled the long drag-rope ready for her lowering. We were proceeding so gently that she as well as I had hopes that I might be able to actually balance the machine on the top of the curving wall--a thing manifestly impossible on a straight surface, though it might have been possible on an angle.|$|E

50|$|A train wheel or {{rail wheel}} {{is a type}} of wheel {{specially}} designed for use on rail tracks. A rolling component is typically pressed onto an axle and mounted directly on a rail car or locomotive or indirectly on a bogie (UK), also called a truck (North America). Wheels are cast or forged (wrought) and are heat-treated to have a specific hardness. New wheels are <b>trued,</b> using a lathe, to a specific profile before being pressed onto an axle. All wheel profiles need to be periodically monitored to ensure proper wheel-rail interface. Improperly <b>trued</b> wheels increase rolling resistance, reduce energy efficiency and may create unsafe operation. A railroad wheel typically consists of two main parts: the wheel itself, and the tire (or tyre) around the outside. A rail tire is usually made from steel, and is typically heated and pressed onto the wheel, where it remains firmly as it shrinks and cools. Monobloc wheels do not have encircling tires, while resilient rail wheels have a resilient material, such as rubber, between the wheel and tire.|$|E

50|$|Gain-twist rifling {{begins with}} very little change in the projectile's angular {{momentum}} {{during the first few}} inches of bullet travel after ignition during the transition from chamber to throat. This enables the bullet to remain essentially undisturbed and <b>trued</b> to the case mouth. After engaging the rifling the bullet is progressively subjected to accelerated angular momentum as burning powder propels it down the barrel.

50|$|MRPs are {{the most}} common {{approach}} to PBR around the world. An MRP features a moratorium on rate cases which typically lasts three to five years. An attrition relief mechanism (“ARM”) adjusts rates or revenues automatically between rate cases to reflect inflation and other changes in business conditions. Some costs are typically addressed separately using cost trackers. Some MRPs feature earnings sharing mechanisms that share surplus or deficit earnings between the utility and customers when the return on equity deviates from its target. Plans may also feature an efficiency carryover mechanism that incentivizes long term performance gains and discourages the opportunistic timing of expenses by permitting the utility to keep a share of cost savings (or absorb a share of high costs) when rates are <b>trued</b> up to cost {{at the end of the}} plan.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that conical wheels and rails that are sloped by the same amount follow curves better than cylindrical wheels and vertical rails. A few railways such as Queensland Railways {{for a long time}} had cylindrical wheels until much heavier traffic required a change.Cylindrical wheel treads have to [...] "skid" [...] on track curves so increase both drag and rail and wheel wear. On very straight track a cylindrical wheel tread rolls more freely and does not [...] "hunt." [...] The gauge is narrowed slightly and the flange fillets keep the flanges from rubbing the rails.United States practice is a 1 in 20 cone when new. As the tread wears it approaches an unevenly cylindrical tread, at which time the wheel is <b>trued</b> on a wheel lathe or replaced.|$|E
50|$|They had one {{peculiarity}} which {{arose from}} their outside frames and counterweights. In {{places where the}} D&RG's standard gauge system met the narrow gauge system, the railroad operated dual gauge trackage, with three rails, so that standard gauge equipment ran on the outer two rails and three foot gauge equipment ran {{on one of the}} outer rails and a third rail, inside the other two. Since the narrow gauge equipment was much lighter than the standard gauge, the inner rail was generally lighter and, therefore, not as tall as the standard gauge rails. In the case of the D&RGW, the difference was ⅞ inch (22 mm). Because the counterweights were outside the frames, they ended up directly over the standard gauge rail, with a clearance of only about ⅝ inch (16 mm). When the shop crews <b>trued</b> up the drivers periodically, they had to be very careful not to go too far.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the three geometrical aspects of truing, the overall tension of the spokes is significant to the wheel's fatigue durability, stiffness, and ability to absorb shock. Too little tension leads to a rim that is easily deformed by impact with rough terrain. Too much tension leads to overstressed spokes which have a short life. Spoke tensiometers are tools which measure the tension in a spoke. Another common method for making rough estimates of spoke tension involves plucking the spokes {{and listening to the}} audible tone of the vibrating spoke. The optimum tension depends on the spoke length and spoke gauge (diameter). Tables are available online which list tensions for each spoke length, either in terms of absolute physical tension, or notes on the musical scale which coincide with the approximate tension to which the spoke should be tuned. It should be noted that in the real world, a properly <b>trued</b> wheel will not, in general, have a uniform tension across all spokes, due to variation among the parts from which the wheel is made.|$|E
60|$|Now such an {{argument}} {{is not hard}} to follow; and if it is granted that its premisses are <b>true</b> in fact, no one will deny that the conclusion must also be <b>true.</b> But it depends for its truth upon an instance of a general logical principle. The logical principle is as follows: 'Suppose it known that if this is <b>true,</b> then that is <b>true.</b> Suppose it also known that this is <b>true,</b> then it follows that that is true.' When it is the case that if this is <b>true,</b> that is <b>true,</b> we shall say that this 'implies' that, and that that 'follows from' this. Thus our principle states that if this implies that, and this is <b>true,</b> then that is <b>true.</b> In other words, 'anything implied by a <b>true</b> proposition is true', or 'whatever follows from a <b>true</b> proposition is true'.|$|R
