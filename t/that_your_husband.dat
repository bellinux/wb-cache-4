2500|$|On 15 November, Dibaba won the Zevenheuvelenloop 15 {{kilometres}} {{road race}} in Nijmegen, Netherlands {{in a world}} best time of 46:28. This bettered Kayoko Fukushi's previous world best by almost half a minute. (Dibaba's record was broken by Florence Kiplagat on 15 February 2015.) This was her first competitive road race since 2005, but she downplayed the idea of moving on to road running, stating that the track remained her priority. Her 5 kilometre splits were 15:58 – 15:25 – 15:05. She said, [...] "Although I trained a lot together with my husband for this race, a roadrace is something different. I {{did not know what}} I could expect. Therefore, I was not that fast in the beginning. ... After 10 kilometres, I pressed the pace and in the final three kilometres it felt like flying. It feels good as you hear after the finish <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> also has won." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They did enjoy it. But I guess {{some of them}} felt {{you were}} showing off--pretending <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> is richer than he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{desire to}} be of use,--of real use. If {{it should be the}} case, Mrs. Crawley, <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> should be--detained at Barchester--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am truly {{sorry to}} have to say it to one of my parishioners, but you are not a good Christian. And we all know <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> {{business}} isn't going at all well, and I think it's a judgment of Providence.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Why?’ urged Cymon, ‘oh why? Such Platonic {{acquaintance}} as ours is so harmless, <b>that</b> even <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> {{can never}} object to it.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{happy to}} tell you, <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> injuries, {{although}} severe and painful, are not serious. No bones are broken, {{but he has}} been severely bruised, and will require careful nursing for some time--and," [...] he added, turning with a smile to the patient, [...] "no more rushing about the country at sixty miles an hour for several weeks to come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{been wanting}} to get it cut for ages. Do you really mean, Margery, <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> can't realise the {{position}} she's placed in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One thing made it {{tolerable}} to us <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> {{should come}} back to the house," [...] said Melbury at last--"the death of Mrs. Charmond." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would ask}} your {{permission}} to sit down," [...] Bernadine remarked, [...] "but I fear to intrude. You are afraid, perhaps, <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> may return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, ho, so you're the one <b>that</b> took <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> {{away from}} me," [...] Benson accused good humoredly, as he tucked the robe around her.|$|R
60|$|HECTOR. The {{man has a}} rooted {{delusion}} <b>that</b> he is <b>your</b> <b>husband.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "In <b>that</b> case, <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> is {{the only}} person who has any {{authority}} over you. These are rather strange questions, Carmina. Won't you take me into your confidence?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} signify. I can easily {{understand}} <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> should wish {{to reflect a}} little before he speaks to me. I can forgive that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> says in {{that little}} letter?" [...] asked Madame Defarge, with a {{lowering}} smile. [...] "Influence; he says something touching influence?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{says that}} you are her sister, {{that you have no}} money of your own and <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> has left you," [...] Tavernake answered, deliberately.|$|E
6000|$|LEE TAI. [Snapping his fingers.] You don't care <b>that</b> for <b>your</b> <b>husband.</b> He loves you. You despise him. Don't {{you wish}} with all <b>your</b> heart <b>that</b> you hadn't married him? ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{the first}} time I {{observed}} a bracelet of dazzling gems on her wrist. [...] "Not diamonds?" [...] I said. She answered, with as much composure {{as if she had}} been the wife of a nobleman, [...] "Yes, diamonds--a present from Marmaduke." [...] This was too much for me; my previsions, so to speak, forced their way into words. [...] "Oh, my poor child!" [...] I burst out, [...] "I'm in mortal fear <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> a gamester!" ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Then {{you must}} make him keep it. I give you till to-morrow morning—no more. If by <b>that</b> time <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> does not solemnly bind himself to help me in this great scheme in which I am interested— ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have heard}} {{something}} in that letter which makes you hope <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> will take you back. Not a woman in London will speak to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But 'worse' {{can never}} mean finding out <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> is fit for Newgate," [...] said Mrs. Hackbutt. [...] "Fancy living {{with such a}} man! I should expect to be poisoned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my dear, {{who is to}} {{say what}} is reasonable? That, you see, is always the difficulty. You must allow <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> is the person who ought to decide that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed,' said Mr Haredale, 'I {{think you}} do. I almost believe <b>that</b> because <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> was bound {{by so many}} ties to our relation, and died in his service and defence, you have come in some sort to connect us with his murder.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou knowest not, my Theo, what a pearl and {{paragon of}} a man my Castalio is; my Chamont, my--oh, dear me, child, what a pity it is <b>that</b> in <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> tragedy he should {{have to take the}} horrid name of Captain Smith!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>that</b> {{you treat}} <b>your</b> <b>husband,</b> <b>that</b> man whom you call Mungana, very badly. Why should you drive {{him to his}} death?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Not yet,” Bethune answered. “I’ve a {{suspicion}} <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> {{was waiting for}} you; and I couldn’t object, because I ventured to believe you would say a word in our favor.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] said Mainwaring, {{with a bow}} to Miss Macy, [...] "but I--I--I--think," [...] {{he added}} conscientiously, [...] "you did not notice <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> had written {{something}} across the paper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All that," [...] he declared, [...] "is {{no reason}} why you should have told Mr. Dowling <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> was a millionaire and had given you carte blanche about taking a house." ...|$|E
6000|$|COLONEL. You say <b>that</b> because he's <b>your</b> <b>husband.</b> [He sits on {{the rustic}} seat.] If your mother'd been there she'd have backed me up! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Flippant!" [...] exclaimed Douglas, impatiently {{moving his}} king. [...] "I verily believe <b>that</b> if <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> {{were at the}} bottom of the Thames at this moment, you would fly off unconcernedly to some other nest, and break hearts with as much {{indifference}} as ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is remarkable! So you've been married? I {{should not}} have thought <b>that</b> possible; and <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> desarted you, too. Well, such things do happen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{venture to}} predict, on a slight acquaintance," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Shorter, undisturbed, [...] "that you will {{pick out the}} house you want, and <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> will move into it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] he begged. [...] "The fact of it is, {{the last}} person I {{expected}} to find here was Peter Phipps. I forgot <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> was connected with his company." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Quiverful," [...] thus {{spoke the}} lady with {{considerable}} austerity, and without sitting down herself, [...] "I find <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> has behaved {{in this matter}} in a very weak and foolish manner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{reminds me}} {{of some of our}} evenings in London," [...] he went on, [...] "when we used to talk music before we went to the Opera. I always found those evenings so restful and pleasant. Won't you try and forget that you have lost a few pennies; forget, also, your other worries, {{whatever}} they may be? I have had a letter to-day from the one great writer whom we both admire. I shall read it to you. And I have a list of the operas for next week. I see <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> little protégée, Felicia Roche, is here." ...|$|R
60|$|LESLIE. That, if God wills, dear, {{you shall}} never know. Whatever it be, think that I knew it all, and only loved you better; think <b>that</b> <b>your</b> true <b>husband</b> is with you, {{and you are}} not to bear it alone.|$|R
6000|$|D'Alcacer {{raised his}} voice {{suddenly}} after her. [...] "Stay! Don't forget <b>that</b> not only <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> but my head, too, is being played at that game. My judgment is not [...] ." ...|$|R
