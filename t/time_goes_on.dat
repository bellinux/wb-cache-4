5|$|Love's {{design process}} {{has become more}} refined as <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on.</b> For Digital, she did not plan {{anything}} in advance; while for Analogue, she worked out the entire design and pacing game in flowcharts before starting. For all of her games, however, she {{does a lot of}} research into the time periods and issues involved. Love does not feel that text is necessarily the best way to tell a story in a game, but finds it easier to communicate with it as a writer.|$|E
5|$|As <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on,</b> Shana and Yuji {{encounter}} {{several more}} Flame Haze, such as Margery Daw and Wilhelmina Carmel, and Denizens in Misaki City. An organization of Denizens called Bal Masqué discovers that Yuji possesses the Reiji Maigo {{and attempt to}} use the Treasure Tool on two separate occasions. Bal Masqué is led by three Lords called the Trinity: Hecate, Sydonay, and Bel Peol. They serve under a Crimson God known as the , who resides within the Reiji Maigo. When the Snake of the Festival emerges, it merges its consciousness with Yuji's, assuming command over Bal Masqué, and together they formulate an elaborate plan to create a parallel world called Xanadu, which {{will serve as a}} paradise for Denizens with unlimited Power of Existence. Shana, {{and all of the other}} Flame Haze around the world, oppose the creation of Xanadu, which would eventually cause a large-scale disruption in the human world, the Crimson Realm and Xanadu itself.|$|E
5|$|Yuu is {{the protagonist}} of Charlotte. He {{develops}} a rude and narcissistic personality once he discovers {{he has the ability}} to take over another person's body for five seconds, but the true nature of his ability enables him to steal someone's superhuman ability by possessing them. Yuu is a first-year student at Hoshinoumi Academy, and he is forced to join its student council. Initially a fake honors student and chronic cheater, Yuu is reluctant to use his ability to aide the student council, but as <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on,</b> he becomes less narcissistic and much more selfless and caring towards others. Over the course of the story, he becomes a fan of the post-rock band Zhiend and falls in love with Nao. After Yuu travels worldwide to steal every ability user's power to protect them from being exploited, the strain of it causes him to lose all of his past memories. His older brother is Shunsuke and his younger sister is Ayumi.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the first}} few seasons, the {{importance}} of Floyd the Barber to the series increased. Slowly, McNear changed his delivery of dialogue for Floyd from fast-paced to slower and slower as <b>time</b> <b>went</b> <b>on.</b> Floyd also became involved more in the plots of the various episodes as <b>time</b> <b>went</b> <b>on.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Caeliar {{offer the}} {{remaining}} humans a merging {{of human and}} Caeliar, to allow both groups to survive. The human survivors are resistant and as <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on,</b> the Caeliar called Sedin becomes the sole survivor of her group, her mental processes and her form both degrading as <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on.</b> When the humans return to Sedin for help, she forces them to merge with her, unwilling to allow herself to die when a union can save her life. The forced merging of the humans and the mostly decayed Caeliar results {{in the creation of}} the first Borg, the name being created due to the fragmented thought of the first drone as he was assimilated (his last thought was that he would not become some cyborg, with his individuality ceasing before he could finish thinking the final word). The gestalt group mind is perverted to become the collective, driven by Sedin's desperate hunger and need to add the strength, technology, and life-force of others to her own. Ironically, while the Caeliar were–albeit accidentally–involved {{in the creation of the}} Borg, they also provide the means to end it; in the 24th century, the Caeliar absorb the entire Borg collective back into themselves, ending the cyborgs' centuries-long reign of terror.|$|E

25|$|Butler {{also uses}} Alice as Dana’s doppelgänger to compare how their {{decisions}} are {{a reflection of}} their environment. According to Missy Dehn Kubitschek, each woman seems to see a reflection of herself in the other; each is the vision {{of what could be}} (could have been) the possible fate of the other given different circumstances. According to Bedore, Butler’s use of repetition blurs the lines between the past and present relationships. As <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on,</b> Alice and Rufus’ relationship begins to seem more like a miserable married couple while Dana and Kevin become somewhat distant.|$|E
25|$|According to Dr Robbie McDonald, Head of Wildlife and Emerging Diseases at FERA (the lead {{wildlife}} {{scientist for}} Defra and responsible {{for research on}} badgers) the benefit of culling a population is outweighed by the detrimental effect on neighbouring populations of badgers. He is reported as saying that {{a huge number of}} badgers would have to be killed to make a difference and while it is cheap and easy to exterminate animals {{in the early days of}} a cull it gets harder and more expensive as <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
25|$|These {{important}} scientific {{findings may}} begin to shift the neuron-specific perspective into a more holistic view of the brain which encompasses the glial cells as well. The glia's importance is becoming ever more clear as <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> and new research is conducted. For the vast part of the last century, scientists have written off glial cells {{to be nothing more}} than the structure and foundations that hold the neurons in place. But now, there is direct evidence that correlates the number of glial cells in the brain with the amount of intelligence that any given species possesses. Future research will begin to shed light on the mysterious, yet increasingly crucial, role of glial cells.|$|E

At the same time, yokai became {{depicted}} in emaki and paintings that stabilized how they appeared, turned them into characters, lessened their fearful nature, and became subjects of entertainment as <b>time</b> <b>went</b> <b>on.</b> The tendency to use yokai as objects of entertainment can be seen starting from the middle ages, and becoming definitive in the Edo periods and beyond.|$|R

25|$|Hanna {{receives}} {{a life sentence}} for her admitted leadership role in the church deaths while the other defendants are sentenced to four years and three months each. Michael (Ralph Fiennes) meanwhile marries, has a daughter, and divorces. Retrieving his books {{from the time of the}} affair with Hanna, he begins reading them into a tape recorder. He sends the cassette tapes and a recorder to Hanna. Eventually, she begins to check the books out from the prison library and teaches herself to read and write by following along with Michael's tapes. She starts writing back to Michael in brief, childlike notes, asking him to write to her. As <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on,</b> the letters reflect her gradually improving literacy.|$|E
25|$|Impulsive {{behavior}} is common, including substance or alcohol abuse, eating disorders, unprotected sex or indiscriminate sex with multiple partners, reckless spending, and reckless driving. Impulsive behavior may also include leaving jobs or relationships, running away, and self-injury. People with BPD act impulsively {{because it gives}} them the feeling of immediate relief from their emotional pain. However, in the long term, people with BPD suffer increased pain from the shame and guilt that follow such actions. A cycle often begins in which people with BPD feel emotional pain, engage in impulsive behavior to relieve that pain, feel shame and guilt over their actions, feel emotional pain from the shame and guilt, and then experience stronger urges to engage in impulsive behavior to relieve the new pain. As <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on,</b> impulsive behavior may become an automatic response to emotional pain.|$|E
25|$|The {{marginal}} value theorem {{is a type}} of optimality model that is often applied to optimal foraging. This theorem is used to describe a situation in which an organism searching for food in a patch must decide when it is economically favorable to leave. While the animal is within a patch, it experiences the law of diminishing returns, where it becomes harder and harder to find prey as <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on.</b> This may be because the prey is being depleted, the prey begins to take evasive action and becomes harder to catch, or the predator starts crossing its own path more as it searches. This law of diminishing returns can be shown as a curve of energy gain per time spent in a patch (Figure 3). The curve starts off with a steep slope and gradually levels off as prey becomes harder to find. Another important cost to consider is the traveling time between different patches and the nesting site. An animal loses foraging time while it travels and expends energy through its locomotion.|$|E

500|$|To {{make sure}} the {{students}} obey the rules and kill each other, the metal collars around their necks track their positions, and will explode if they linger in a [...] "Forbidden Zone", randomly selected areas of the island that increase as the Program goes on to force Students closer to each other, or attempt to remove the collars. The Forbidden Zones are randomly chosen areas of the map that increase in number as <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on,</b> re-sculpting and shrinking the battlefield and forcing the students to move around. The collars secretly transmit sound back to {{the organizers of the}} game, allowing them to hear the students' conversations, root out escape plans, and log their activities. The collars will explode if the students go a full day without anyone dying.|$|E

500|$|In 1981, the band's third studio album, 7, reached number 5 in the UK album {{charts and}} {{contained}} three hit singles: [...] "Grey Day" [...] (no. 4, April 1981), [...] "Shut Up" [...] (no. 7, September 1981), and [...] "Cardiac Arrest" [...] (no. 14, February 1982). In {{an article in}} 1979, Chris Foreman explained that the band's music would move with the times, and change styles as <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on.</b> This was shown to be the case, as unlike the two ska-filled, fast-paced albums that preceded it, 7 {{was something of a}} change in direction. Suggs' vocal performance changed significantly, and his strong accent from the previous albums had been watered down. The album strayed from the ska-influenced sound of One Step Beyond... and Absolutely, and moved towards a pop sound; a trend that continued with subsequent albums.|$|E

In June 2014, PewDiePie, announced that a fourth charity drive for [...] "Save the Children" [...] raised over $630,000, surpassing a $250,000 goal. In an interview with the Swedish magazine Icon, he has expressed desire to continue these drives as <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on,</b> and also credited John and Hank Green as two individuals who gave him the idea of making unique videos for charity. These videos are purchased by game manufacturers and advertisers, for prices ranging up to $50,000.|$|E
500|$|In a late 1989 {{interview}} with John Robb in Sounds, Cobain {{noted that the}} band's music was changing. He said, [...] "The early songs were really angry... But as <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> the songs are getting poppier and poppier as I get happier and happier. The songs are now about conflicts in relationships, emotional things with other human beings". In April 1990, the band began working with producer Butch Vig at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin on recordings for the follow-up to Bleach. During the sessions, Cobain and Novoselic became disenchanted with Channing's drumming, and Channing expressed frustration at not being actively involved in songwriting. As bootlegs of Nirvana's demos with Vig began to circulate {{in the music industry}} and draw attention from major labels, Channing left the band. That July, the band recorded the single [...] "Sliver" [...] with Mudhoney drummer Dan Peters. Nirvana asked Dale Crover to fill in on drums for a seven-date American West Coast tour with Sonic Youth that August.|$|E
