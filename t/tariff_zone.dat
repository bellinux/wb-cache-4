25|$|Today, the Berlin S-Bahn is {{no longer}} defined as this special tariff area of the {{national}} railway company, but is instead just one specific means of transportation, defined by its special technical characteristics, in an area-wide tariff administered by a public transport authority. The Berlin S-Bahn is now {{an integral part of}} the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg, the regional <b>tariff</b> <b>zone</b> for all kinds of public transit in and around Berlin and the federal state (Bundesland) of Brandenburg.|$|E
25|$|While in {{the first}} decades of this <b>tariff</b> <b>zone</b> the trains were steam-drawn, and while even after the {{electrification}} of large parts of the network a number of lines remained under steam, today the term S-Bahn is used in Berlin only for those lines and trains with third-rail electrical power transmission and the special Berlin S-Bahn loading gauge. The third unique technical feature, of the Berlin S-Bahn, the automated mechanical train control is being phased out and replaced by a communications-based train control system, but which again is specific to the Berlin S-Bahn.|$|E

2500|$|With {{individual}} sections {{dating from}} the 1870s, the S-Bahn was formed in time as the network of suburban commuter railways running into Berlin, then interconnected by the circular railway connecting the various terminal railway stations, and in 1882 enhanced by the east-west cross-city line (called the [...] "Stadtbahn", [...] "city railway"). The forming of a distinct identity for this network began {{with the establishment of}} a special tariff for the area which was then called the [...] "Berliner Stadt-, Ring- und Vorortbahnen", and which differed from the normal railway tariff. While the regular railway tariff was based on multiplying the distance covered with a fixed price per kilometer, the special tariff for this Berlin <b>tariff</b> <b>zone</b> was based on a graduated tariff {{based on the number of}} stations touched during the travel.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "City-ticket" [...] is {{currently}} available in 118 German cities. Bahncard 25/50 holders who travel over [...] with an intercity ticket {{are eligible for}} one free connecting journey by local public transport at their departure and destination, provided that they are located in cities participating in the program. The return journey to the railway station is also free for a return ticket. The text [...] "+City" [...] is printed on the DB train ticket, making it valid as a local transport ticket. In most participating cities, this ticket is valid on the entire network (rail+bus+tram), in some it is valid beyond the city limits, and in a some only for certain operators. In Hamburg the City-ticket is only valid {{in certain parts of}} the city, depending on what train station the passenger arrives in. In Berlin and Frankfurt the City-ticket is only valid in the central <b>tariff</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E

40|$|The sole {{implementation}} of a Bus Rapid Transit System -BRT parallel to the conventional {{is not enough to}} guarantee meeting users and operators’ needs within the Metropolitan Area of Bucaramanga -MAB, Colombia. As time passed, these systems became inefficient; as a result, users started looking for alternative non-formal transportation means and the State incurred in additional financing for the permanence of the system. This paper seeks to bolster the modes of public transportation through a fare strategy that agrees with the actual distances travelled by the user. In other words, the purpose of this work is to establish <b>tariff</b> <b>zones</b> for the AMB to differentiate between those users moving in short journeys and those who travel long distances to get to their destination {{in order to create a}} balance between the users’ benefit, the quality of the travel, and the operation costs of BRT. ...|$|R

Analysis of <b>tariff</b> <b>zones</b> of day should be based not only on a statistical study of the power system configuration and load profiles of consumer groups, but also on an assessment of the character and level of the hourly counteraction "differentiated tariff" changing consumer demand for power of all other electricity consumers. ????????? ????? ??????????????? ????????????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ? ????? ????????????, ??????? ????????? ????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ??????????? ??????? ??? ????? ? ??????? ???????? ????????. ??????????? ???????????? ?????? ??????? ????????? ? ??????? ??????????????? ????????????? ???????????? ????????? ?????? ?? ???????? ???? ?????????, ??????????????? ???????????? ? ?????? ??? ?????. ?????? ???????? ??? ????? ?????? ???????????? ?? ?????? ?? ?????????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ? ????? ????????????, ?? ????? ? ?? ?????? ????????? ? ??????? ?????????? ??????????????? ????????????? ???????????? ????????? ?????? ?? ???????? ???? ????????? ???????????? ??????????????...|$|R

It is mainly oriented on underground, trams and buses. Further it is described the ticket system, <b>tariff</b> <b>zones</b> and function of pick up company of the cars who are parked wrongly. The practical part is made of results on a research questionnaire that I made among students in the university. The questions in the survey are related to how much the public transport is used, the comfort of transport, the way of paying and security {{from the point of view}} of the students in the university.
