5|$|The {{main part}} of the book {{consists}} of six chapters, with a chapter covering each of the five days (Wednesday, March 28, 1979, to Sunday, April 1, 1979) of the crisis stage of <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> another chapter covering its immediate effects. Walker draws {{on a wide range of}} sources, but mainly on the report of the Kemeny Commission, which President Carter appointed immediately after <b>the</b> <b>accident,</b> <b>and</b> the Rogovin Report, which resulted from the NRC's own inquiry.|$|E
5|$|Walker's {{objective}} in Three Mile Island {{was to write}} a comprehensive and authoritative history that would serve as an authoritative record for both the interested public and the NRC. The book provides {{a detailed account of}} the causes of <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> the response to it by the NRC, the state of Pennsylvania, and the White House.|$|E
5|$|A simple {{record of}} depth {{and time for}} a dive is useful as a legal record of a diving operation, where this is required, {{and in the case}} of an {{accident}} during the dive, an accurately recorded dive profile can provide useful diagnostic information for treatment of the injured diver and for analysis of the circumstances leading to <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> the action taken during and after the incident. A proposed dive profile is necessary for effective dive planning, both for estimating the required breathing gas composition and quantities, for planning decompression, and for choosing suitable diving equipment and other logistical aspects.|$|E

5|$|After the crash, both Crossair and CCP, {{including}} the pilots {{who had previously}} spoken {{to the media and}} been fired, publicly stated that the coincidence between <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> the dispute was very unfortunate and that reports about pilot error being involved in the crash were speculation, although this conclusion was later established to be the probable cause of the accident.|$|E
5|$|In September 1999 Swissair, Delta, and Boeing (who had {{acquired}} McDonnell Douglas through a merger in 1997) agreed to share liability for <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> offered {{the families of}} the passengers financial compensation. The offer was rejected in favour of a $19.8billion suit against Swissair and DuPont, the supplier of the Mylar insulation sheathing. A US federal court dismissed the claim in February 2002.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{evidence}} in determining the cause of Flight 370's disappearance, even physical evidence that the aircraft crashed, raises many issues regarding responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> payments made by insurance agencies. Under the Montreal Convention, it is the carrier's responsibility to prove lack of fault in an accident and each passenger's next-of-kin are automatically entitled, regardless of fault, to a payment of approximately US$175,000 from the airline's insurance company—a total of nearly US$40million for the 227 passengers on board.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the reaction of}} energy stock prices to <b>the</b> <b>accidents</b> <b>and</b> to <b>the</b> government responses. We examine both the market reaction soon after <b>the</b> <b>accidents,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> period thereafter when the Institution Supporting Compensation for Nuclear Damages Act was passed and signed into law. TEPCO’s stock price lost the largest for direct damage of its nuclear plants in Fukushima. Also nuclear business stock prices drooped. We find that the more a power company depends on nuclear energy; its stock price dropped more after <b>the</b> <b>accident.</b> In contrast, alternative energy stock prices gained from <b>the</b> <b>accident.</b> <b>The</b> abnormal returns depend on business compositions of energy stocks and nuclear business stocks. We find that the market believes the primary beneficiary of the Act was TEPCO but other power companies did not gained much...|$|R

During the conversation, Hardt overhears that Mootz was drunk the night of <b>the</b> <b>accident,</b> <b>and</b> is relieved. Immediately, Mootz's rain powers seem to disappear.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 2006 at 4:45 pm, a {{structural}} {{failure in the}} 'Rose Bowl' section of the ride created a bump on the track that caused a train {{to come to an}} abrupt stop. Twenty-seven injuries were reported in <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> rescue units were required to evacuate the riders. Most of the injuries were of the chest or neck. Seventeen people were released from the hospital within five hours of <b>the</b> <b>accident,</b> <b>and</b> two were admitted. None of the injuries were life-threatening. After an inspection the following day, the park stated that the accident was caused by a crack or split in the wood. The ride was shut down {{for an extended period of}} time, while the park worked with the State of Ohio to complete a full investigation. The park completed repairs of the ride but the state asked for extensive testing to be done to ensure it would not happen again. The park indicated that the ride would not reopen until the 2007 season.|$|E

NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman attended the unveiling along with Mayor Gray. Another memorial plaque was also installed, by Metro officials, at Fort Totten station; it was subject to complaints from relatives of the dead, who claimed that it was insensitive.|$|E

5|$|The Peruvian {{government}} investigated <b>the</b> <b>accident,</b> <b>and</b> in {{its final}} report concluded that the probable cause of the accident was the improper execution of engine-out procedures by the flight crew, with contributing factors of improper loading of the aircraft and improper maintenance procedures by company personnel. There was also evidence of a coverup and falsification of critical maintenance records by LANSA employees during the investigation process. The Peruvian government subsequently fined LANSA {{and some of its}} employees, and suspended the airline's operating license for 90 days as a consequence.|$|E
5|$|The {{eradication}} campaign {{led to the}} death of Janet Parker (c.1938–1978) and the subsequent suicide of the smallpox expert Henry Bedson (1930–1978). Parker was an employee of the University of Birmingham who worked in the same building as Bedson's smallpox laboratory. She was infected by a strain of smallpox virus that Bedson's team had been investigating. Ashamed of <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> having blamed himself for it, Bedson committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiation}} doses {{received in}} these two accidents are not known with any semblance of accuracy.

In a meeting that evening, the Governor accepted Russia assistance, while it was confirmed by international agreement that the investigation would be led by the authorities in the country where the accident occurred, Norway. On 31 August, Minister of Justice Grete Faremo visited the Russian settlements as a representative from the Government of Norway.|$|E
5|$|Hansell's first duty {{assignment}} {{was with the}} 2nd Bombardment Group at Langley Field, testing repaired aircraft. In June 1930, he spent three months temporary duty with the 6th Field Artillery at Fort Hoyle, Maryland. In September 1930, he returned to Langley Field and was detached to the Air Corps Tactical School as armament officer. While stationed at Langley, Hansell was involved in two minor accidents in aircraft he was piloting, and in early 1931 was forced to parachute to safety when his Boeing P-12 stalled during a test flight, going into an unrecoverable spin. He was found at fault for <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> initially charged $10,000 by the Air Corps for {{the expense of the}} aircraft, but the cost was eventually written off.|$|E
5|$|On 15 November 1982, {{while on}} a {{training}} flight outside Kunsan Air Base in South Korea, USAF Captain Ted Harduvel died when he crashed inverted into a mountain ridge. In 1985, Harduvel's widow {{filed a lawsuit against}} General Dynamics claiming an electrical malfunction, not pilot error, as the cause; a jury awarded the plaintiff $3.4 million in damages. However, in 1989, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled the contractor had immunity to lawsuits, overturning the previous judgment. The court did remand the plaintiff's claim of electrical malfunction as the cause, noting that General Dynamics and the USAF knew about chafing of instrumentation wiring, which they had not initially disclosed. <b>The</b> <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> subsequent trial was the subject of the 1992 film Afterburn.|$|E
