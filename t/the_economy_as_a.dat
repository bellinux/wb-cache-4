5|$|Participation in the Crusades {{was also}} {{seen as a}} form of pilgrimage, and indeed the same Latin word, peregrinatio, was {{sometimes}} applied to both activities. While English participation in the First Crusade between 1095 and 1099 was limited, England played a prominent part in the Second, Third and Fifth Crusades over the next two centuries, with many crusaders leaving for the Levant during the intervening years. The idea of undertaking a pilgrimage to Jerusalem was not new in England, however, as the idea of religiously justified warfare went back to Anglo-Saxon times. Many of those who took up the Cross to go on a Crusade never actually left, often because the individual lacked sufficient funds to undertake the journey. Raising funds to travel typically involved crusaders selling or mortgaging their lands and possessions, which affected their families and, at times, considerably affected <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{some other}} rebels in the leadership, Rau kept {{most of his}} positions. He {{remained}} {{a member of the}} Politburo and deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers. In the Politburo he continued to be responsible for the industry of the GDR. However, his position had been weakened. Bruno Leuschner, a follower of Ulbricht and Rau's successor as chairman of the National Planning Commission, now became a new candidate member of the Politburo. During the ensuing period, Leuschner, often supported by Ulbricht, gradually superseded Rau as the senior leader for <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole. The official GDR press never mentioned the dissension between Rau and Leuschner and always described their cooperation as a success story.|$|E
5|$|Support for airport {{expansion}} {{is based on}} an economic case that regards the air transport industry not only as an important industry in its own right, but also as a facilitator of growth for <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole. One study predicts that the government's strategy will realise an additional £13billion per annum in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2030. Another study which is critical of the government approach, and which favours addressing environmental impacts through increased taxation of air transport, indicates a negative economic benefit resulting from airport expansion. In 2006 the industry was responsible for over 6 per cent of all UK carbon emissions, a figure that is set to rise as demand increases. Under current strategies of emissions reduction and growth in air transport, air travel in the UK could account for up to 50 per cent of the UK carbon budget by 2050. Industry attempts to address this issue are longer term efforts based on technological and operational improvements, whilst government policy is based on the inclusion of air transport within emissions trading schemes. Critics advocate a shift in government policy to address environmental impacts by constraining the growth in demand for air travel, primarily through the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively. Local environmental issues include noise and air quality, and the impact of these, particularly {{in the case of the}} former, is subject to debate. Government policy generally is that these are local issues best addressed locally, and has introduced legislation designed to facilitate this.|$|E
25|$|Thorstein Veblen {{laid the}} {{foundation}} for the perspective of institutional economics with his criticism of traditional static economic theory. <b>As</b> much <b>as</b> Veblen was <b>an</b> economist, he was also a sociologist who rejected his contemporaries who looked at <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> autonomous, stable, and static entity. Veblen disagreed with his peers, as he strongly believed that <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> was significantly embedded in social institutions. Rather than separating economics from the social sciences, Veblen viewed the relationships between <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> and social and cultural phenomena. Generally speaking, the study of institutional economics viewed economic institutions as the broader process of cultural development. While economic institutionalism never transformed into a major school of economic thought, it allowed economists to explore economic problems from a perspective that incorporated social and cultural phenomena. It also allowed economists to view <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> evolving entity of bounded rationale.|$|R

25|$|Economics is {{a social}} science which studies the production, distribution, trade, and {{consumption}} of goods and services. Economics focuses on measurable variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: microeconomics, which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole, in which case it considers aggregate supply and demand for money, capital and commodities. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are resource allocation, production, distribution, trade, and competition. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that involves choice under scarcity or determining economic value.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem is}} that unless we impose very strong {{mathematical}} restrictions, we cannot say that this Cobb-Douglas production function for sector i plus one for sector j (plus that for sector k, etc.) {{adds up to a}} Cobb-Douglas production function for <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole (with K and L being the sum of all of the different sectoral values).

25|$|A {{good example}} of the use of {{probability}} theory in equity trading is the effect of the perceived probability of any widespread Middle East conflict on oil prices, which have ripple effects in <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole. An assessment by a commodity trader that a war is more likely can send that commodity's prices up or down, and signals other traders of that opinion. Accordingly, the probabilities are neither assessed independently nor necessarily very rationally. The theory of behavioral finance emerged to describe the effect of such groupthink on pricing, on policy, and on peace and conflict.|$|E
25|$|A related issue, said Pius, is the {{relation}} between capital and labour and the determination of fair wages. Pius develops the following ethical mandate: The Church considers it a perversion of industrial society to have developed sharp opposite camps based on income. He welcomes all attempts to alleviate these differences. Three elements determine a fair wage: the worker's family, the economic condition of the enterprise, and <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole. The family has an innate right to development, but this is only possible {{within the framework of}} a functioning economy and a sound enterprise. Thus, Pius concludes that cooperation and not conflict is a necessary condition, given the mutual interdependence of the parties involved.|$|E

25|$|The antecedents can {{be traced}} back to the Romantics of the 19th century as well as some Enlightenment {{political}} economists of that era. Concerns over population were expressed by Thomas Malthus, while John Stuart Mill predicted the desirability of the stationary state of an economy. Mill thereby anticipated later insights of modern ecological economists, but without having had their experience of the social and ecological costs of the Post–World War II economic expansion. As Martinez-Alier explores in his book the debate on energy in economic systems can also be traced into the 19th century e.g. Nobel prize-winning chemist, Frederick Soddy (1877–1956). Soddy criticized the prevailing belief of <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> perpetual motion machine, capable of generating infinite wealth—a criticism echoed by his intellectual heirs in the now emergent field of ecological economics.|$|E

25|$|Immigrants {{may often}} do types {{of work that}} natives are largely unwilling to do, {{contributing}} to greater economic prosperity for <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole: for instance, Mexican migrant workers taking up manual farm work in the United States has close to zero effect on native employment in that occupation, {{which means that the}} effect of Mexican workers on U.S. employment outside farm work was therefore most likely positive, since they raised overall economic productivity. Research indicates that immigrants are more likely to work in risky jobs than U.S.-born workers, partly due to differences in average characteristics, such as immigrants' lower English language ability and educational attainment. Further, some studies indicate that higher ethnic concentration in metropolitan areas is positively related to the probability of self-employment of immigrants.|$|E
