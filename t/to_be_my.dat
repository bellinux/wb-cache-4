500|$|Written and {{produced}} by Madonna and Pettibone, [...] "This Used <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>My</b> Playground" [...] {{was the first}} time that Pettibone worked with live string arrangement. Madonna recorded the song on a Shure SM57 microphone, with instrumentation from piano, organ, strings and a basic drum sounds. During the final recording, the duo had to redo the whole orchestra section to tailor it for the song. [...] "This Used <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>My</b> Playground" [...] starts with a keyboard introduction and strings, with Madonna singing in expressive but subdued vocals. Its verse and chorus merge into each other for having a continuity in the song, but the track ends abruptly. Lyrically it discusses visiting one's childhood places and not letting go of the past.|$|E
500|$|... "This Used <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>My</b> Playground" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Madonna. It is the theme for the film A League of Their Own, which starred Madonna, and portrayed a fictionalized account of the real-life All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Madonna was asked to record a song for the film's soundtrack. At that time she was busy recording her fifth studio album, Erotica, [...] with producer Shep Pettibone. They worked on some ideas {{and came up with}} [...] "This Used <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>My</b> Playground" [...] in two days. Once presented to director Penny Marshall's team, the song was released as a standalone single on June 16, 1992, by Warner Bros. Records. However, it was not available on the film's soundtrack due to contractual obligations and was later added to the Olympics-inspired Barcelona Gold compilation album, released that summer. The song was included on Madonna's 1995 ballads compilation Something to Remember.|$|E
500|$|... "This Used <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>My</b> Playground" [...] {{features}} a keyboard introduction, {{followed by the}} strings and the song starts. Musically, the song {{is set in the}} time signature of common time with a slow tempo of 77 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G minor with Madonna vocals ranging from the chords of G3 to B4. The song follows a basic sequence of Gm–F/G–Emaj7–Dm7–Gsus–G as its chord progression. The chords have an unexpected flow in terms of the beginning and the ending, moving from E down to Gm and momentarily to F major, then going back to the previous sequence again. The song has a lush, romantic quality, with the melody going through different ranges and peaks, and the verse and the chorus flow into each other, making it sound seamless. Madonna sings in subdued but expressive vocals, aided by the strings and background singers during the third verse. Towards the end the singer's voice is double tracked and produces little amount of roughness. Lyrically the song talks about Madonna revisiting the places from her childhood ("This used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> playground / This used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> childhood dream"), and evokes the songwriting on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer (1989). The singer is in a dilemma between choosing the past and letting go, concluding that the latter is difficult ("Say goodbye to yesterday (the dream) / Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say))". The track has a sudden ending with the orchestra and the backing vocal uttering [...] "Wishing you were here with me", the line addressed to Madonna's mother.|$|E

500|$|Louis Virtel, from TheBacklot.com, placed [...] "This Used <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>My</b> Playground" [...] {{at number}} 52 of his list [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs".

Bautist, from the Philippine Daily Inquirer, called {{it one of the}} singer's [...] "alternative tunes [...] that can be as romantic and touching as any ballad". Liz Smith, from The Toledo Blade, called it an [...] "exquisite ballad". On his review of the compilation Barcelona Gold, The Daily Gazettes Bill Rice wrote: [...] "Madonna's plaintive single 'This Used <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>My</b> Playground', is one medal winner". A negative review came from Stylus Magazines Alfred Soto, who dismissed the song as a [...] "slushy rewrite of Like a Prayers 'Promise to Try'".
