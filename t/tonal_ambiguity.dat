25|$|The {{second set}} of Préludes for piano (1913) {{features}} Debussy at his most avant-garde, where he uses dissonant harmonies to evoke specific moods and images. He consciously gives titles to each prelude which amplify the preludes' <b>tonal</b> <b>ambiguity</b> and dissonance. He uses scales such as the whole tone scale, musical modes, and the octatonic scale in his preludes which exaggerate this <b>tonal</b> <b>ambiguity,</b> making the key of each prelude almost indistinguishable at times. The second book of Préludes for piano represents his strong interest in the indefinite and esoteric.|$|E

5000|$|This {{is perhaps}} the best-known of the three csárdás. The piece is written in a {{miniature}} sonata form, with the bare fifths at the opening without precedent in Liszt's output. Still more intriguing is the second-subject stage of the structure; this is either a parody of the Dies irae or a quotation from the Hungarian folk song, [...] "Ég a kunyhó, ropog a nád." [...] Both theories have their advocates. The composer did not indicate what he meant, though he did write on the manuscript after he had finished it, [...] "May one write or listen to such a thing?" [...] A favorite question of some critics is whether the fifth of the opening bar is a flattened supertonic appoggiatura or as an actual tonic. Such <b>tonal</b> <b>ambiguities</b> become common in Liszt's late works.|$|R
40|$|Although Robert Schumann’s late {{style has}} been the subject of several probing studies in recent years, few {{scholars}} have concentrated their attention on the chamber works composed in the autumn of 1851. Perhaps most intriguing are the opp. 105 and 121 violin sonatas, whose first movements suggest a dialogue with the eighteenth-century sonata form by preserving many of the same rhetorical and structural elements. Throughout both movements, however, Schumann uses an intricate web of <b>tonal</b> <b>ambiguities,</b> metrical dissonances, and unusual key relationships to recast the internal workings of these outwardly conventional sonata forms. As he uses these techniques to undermine important structural moments of each movement, Schumann significantly changes the overall plot of the eighteenth-century sonata form, while also demonstrating his sensitivity to the dramatic possibilities of this historical form in the middle of the nineteenth century. By discussing Schumann’s dialogue with the eighteenth-century sonata form throughout the opp. 105 and 121 violin sonatas, this study attempts to situate these works within both their historical and contemporary musical contexts, and thus considers a previously unexplored avenue toward rehabilitating the reception of Schumann’s late chamber works.

Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that his interest in these songs was heightened by his study of them while compiling his folk song collections. He wrote that he [...] "was captivated by the poetic side of the cult of sun-worship, and sought its survivals and echoes in both the tunes and the words of the songs. The pictures of the ancient pagan period and spirit loomed before me, as it then seemed, with great clarity, luring me on with the charm of antiquity.

5000|$|Some {{problems}} arise when the Thai script {{is used to}} write Northern Thai. In particular, Standard Thai script cannot transcribe all Northern Thai tones. The two falling tones in Northern Thai correspond to a single falling tone in Thai. Specifically, Northern Thai has two types of falling tones: high-falling tone (...) and falling tone (...) [...] However, Thai lacks {{the distinction between the}} two falling tones, not having a high-falling tone (...) [...] When using Thai script to write Northern Thai tones, the distinction of the two falling tones is lost because Thai script can only indicate a low falling tone (...) [...] As an example, the tonal distinction between [...] (ก้า ( [...] กล้า) [...] "to be brave") and [...] (ก้า ( [...] ค่า) [...] "value") is lost when written in Thai since as only [...] (ก้า) is permitted. Consequently, the meaning of ก้า is ambiguous as it can mean both [...] "to be brave" [...] and [...] "value". Similarly, [...] (ป้าย ( [...] ป้าย) [...] "sign") and [...] (ป้าย ( [...] พ่าย) [...] "to lose") have the same problem and only [...] (ป้าย) is permitted. As a result, the spelling ป้าย is ambiguous because it can mean both [...] "sign" [...] or [...] "to lose".

The Schenkerian analytical notation employed in this paper follows guidelines for which Steve Larson uses the term “strict use. ” This analytical method clearly depicts the remarkable ways in which the motto seems to present simultaneous conflicting meanings.

40|$|This paper {{adopts a}} {{descriptive}} approach {{in analyzing the}} counting system of the Yoruba language. It explains the technicalities of its arithmetical involvements which {{appear to have been}} contributing to the difficulty often encountered in its learning. The study relies on three major sources in gathering data for the descriptive analysis, namely, compilation of relevant list of Yoruba numerals, the researcher’s intuitive knowledge of the language coupled with his training as a linguist, and a search of the relevant literature. The work throws more light on the crucial roles of some affixes in realizing some odd numbers, multiples of twenty, centenary, bicentenary etc in their order of increase. The paper goes much further to examine the linguistic structure of numerals in a bid to bring to light some salient linguistic features that are of significant interest to the teaching of the grammar of the language. Here, we discover that Yoruba numerals derive more of its formation from different aspects of the language structure like sound level (phonology), form/structure level (morphology and syntax), and meaning level (semantics) as evidenced in instances like deletion, assimilation, coalescence, <b>tonal</b> changes, <b>ambiguity,</b> affixation, linguistic typology to mention a few. We also discover that unlike in English, the direction of counting in Yoruba is done from right-to-left. Not only this, it adopts base five, decimal (base ten) and vigesimal systems of counting. This is because the language employs a numeral structure where counting is done mostly i...|$|R

40|$|THESIS 7143. 1 THESIS 7143. 2 This thesis synthesises {{significant}} {{aspects of}} recent analytical approaches and applies that synthetic method to selected works by Chopin. While the method may {{be regarded as}} an extension of Heinrich Schenker?s analytical approach, its specific combination of four aspects distinguishes this synthesis from previous analytical approaches: attention to the rhythms created by pitch events on all structural levels; a detailed accounting of the musical surface; ?strict use? of analytical notation following guidelines offered by Steve Larson; and a continual concern with what have been called ?strategies? or ?premises?. This approach thus builds on the work of such authors as William Rothstein, Carl Schachter, and John Rink, and, like their work, it raises interpretive questions of central interest to performers. Applying this method to selected Preludes (Opus 28 Nos. 5, 12, 14, 16, 21, and 22) presents a new picture of the Preludes. Analysis of Preludes that are not as strongly ?closed? as some other pieces not only illuminates the role of closure and motive in those pieces, but also raises interesting questions about the meaning of finding an Ursatz in such pieces. This method also demonstrates how each Prelude projects a different affect through the use of compositional techniques such as elision, reinterpretation, and <b>tonal</b> and metric <b>ambiguity.</b> It reveals hidden repetitions that have a durational as well as tonal aspect. They are organised on multiple levels by rhythm as well as pitch. Indeed, surface rhythms are reflected in the background organisation of each of the Preludes analysed here...|$|R

Each instrument can play a rhythmic, harmonic, or melodic role, or any combination of the three. The lines between solos, lead instruments, and accompaniment are blurred.

50|$|In one sense, {{it can be}} {{tempting to}} think of the late pieces as an {{extension}} of Liszt's earlier works, as they exhibit a similar adventurousness harmonically, an intense chromaticism and a <b>tonal</b> <b>ambiguity.</b> What is new is the sadness of heart which pervades many of the late works. As tempting as it can be to think of Liszt as the father of modern music {{on the basis of his}} late music, looking at his achievements in these works as ends in themselves would be erroneous. Liszt's technical achievements in his late music are one side of a more complex picture. Along with the increasing interest in Hungarian and other national schools of composition already mentioned, essential parts of this picture are tragedy in Liszt's personal life and developments in his friendship with Wagner.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the music}} of some late-Romantic or post-Romantic composers such as Richard Wagner, Hugo Wolf, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Anton Bruckner, Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Alexander Scriabin, and others, we find a variety of {{harmonic}} and linear procedures that {{have the effect of}} weakening functional tonality. These procedures may produce a suspension of tonality or may create a sense of <b>tonal</b> <b>ambiguity,</b> even to the point that at times the sense of tonality is completely lost.

Wyn Thomas, Senior Lecturer in Music at Bangor University, Wales (UK), comments as follows: [...] "This tune is exceptional amongst Welsh hymn tunes, in that {{it begins with a}} tonic chord in its first inversion (i.e. a Ib chord or a I 6/3 chord). This is unheard of in the Welsh hymn tune repertoire because all other hymn tune composers establish the fundamental tonic (root-position) chord (i.e. chord Ia or I 5/3 chord) at the outset, with the tonic note in the bass part. Though Dr Caradog Roberts opens [...] "Rachie" [...] with a tonic chord, the 3rd of the chord appears in the bass part. This chordal arrangement gives rise to <b>tonal</b> <b>ambiguity</b> and can cause difficulty during unaccompanied performances." ...|$|E
50|$|The song {{is notable}} for its <b>tonal</b> <b>ambiguity,</b> a common feature of Bacharach's constructivist style. The verse is in G major, with a lydian {{implication}} in the melody {{supported by the}} supertonic major. At {{the start of the}} chorus, an interruption of the expected cadence by the subdominant chord (C major) establishes this as the new tonic, with the remainder of the chorus centred around the submediant, dominant and subdominant chords of this key. A similar interruption {{at the end of the}} chorus converts an expected perfect cadence in the new key to a modal cadence back into G major. At the end of the song, a dominant seventh on the tonic resolves as a perfect cadence into a new key to finish the song on the subdominant chord of the principal key (C major as viewed from the perspective of a G major tonality).|$|E
5000|$|La voix humaine {{stands out}} from Poulenc's {{previous}} works {{because it is}} marked by a certain <b>tonal</b> <b>ambiguity.</b> Poulenc achieves this sensation through the avoidance of traditional harmonic functions and the preponderance of unresolved dissonances, diminished structures, and progressions of chromatically-related chords. [...] Although some passages—most often those in which the voice becomes more lyrical—have a clear tonal center, the tonally ambiguous sections are much more frequent in Poulenc's score. [...] Grover-Friedlander suggests that the music is motivically, rather than tonally, driven. [...] Yet in these motives, she identifies a number of tonal references, including [...] "half steps or leading notes, sevenths, or appoggiaturas, which raise expectations for tonal functioning and tonal resolutions. Poulenc's motivic, cell-like aesthetics does not undermine a sense of totality, but treats it as constantly deferred, or in motion." [...] Poulenc thereby uses tonal techniques in a more modern, tonally ambiguous harmonic language.|$|E
