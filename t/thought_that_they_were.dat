5|$|It is {{possible}} that his last fight was an 85-minute contest at Shrewsbury in July 1790. This was widely reported in the London press and that of provincial cities but was subsequently denied by newspapers more local to the event. There were unsuccessful attempts after that date to match him against Ben Bryan (sometimes known as Ben Brian, Ben Brain or Ben Bryant), who had by that time defeated Johnson. Indeed, these attempts, conducted by Daniel Mendoza, did not help {{the cause of his}} employment with Boulton and Watt as the firm <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> a distraction and expressed concern regarding his commitment to his work.|$|E
5|$|Following the Republic of the Congo's {{independence}} from Belgium in 1960, the country fell into disorder as the army mutinied. Shortly thereafter South Kasai and the State of Katanga declared {{independence from}} the Congolese government. The latter contained {{the vast majority of}} the Congo's valuable mineral resources and attracted significant mining activity under Belgian rule. Many Katangese <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> entitled to the revenue generated through the lucrative industry, and feared that under the new central government it would be distributed among the Congo's poorer provinces. Resulting nativist politics with support from the Belgian government and private interests such as the Union Minière du Haut Katanga (UMHK) precipitated the Katangese secession.|$|E
5|$|Stirling {{still held}} the line against Grant on the American right, to the west. He held on for four hours, still {{unaware of the}} British {{flanking}} maneuver, {{and some of his}} own troops <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> winning the day because the British had been unable to take their position. However, Grant was reinforced by 2,000 marines, and he hit Stirling's center by 11:00, and Stirling was attacked on his left by the Hessians. Stirling pulled back, but British troops were coming at him from the rear, south down the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across a Brouwer's millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards wide, {{on the other side of}} Brooklyn Heights.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{tympanum}} and stapes to effectively transmit vibrations is called impedance matching. Early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick stapes with poor impedance matching, so it is now <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not used for hearing. Instead, these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch. Early temnospondyls, like Dendrerpeton, could not hear airborne sound but {{would have been able}} to detect vibration in the ground. Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing. Doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct, which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing. Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound. The hearing system of Doleserpeton and related temnospondyls was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians.|$|E
5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} {{as though they}} were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> made of paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E
5|$|Cystidia {{that are}} located {{along the edge}} of the cap (called cheilocystidia) are spherical, and 30–120 by 20–74µm. The facial cystidia (called pleurocystidia) are {{club-shaped}} or elongated ellipses, up to 130–155µm in length. The pleurocystidia protrude from the face of the gill and act as guards, preventing adjacent gills from touching each other, and also ensuring that the basidia and spores have sufficient room for development. C.micaceus may also have scattered caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are 60–100 by 5–10µm, but their presence is variable and cannot reliably be used for identification. Both De Bary and Buller, in their investigations into the structure of the cystidia, concluded that there is a central mass of cytoplasm formed where numerous thin plates of cytoplasm meet at the center of the cell. De Bary believed that the plates were filamentous branching processes, but Buller <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> formed in a process similar to the walls of foam bubbles, and that the central mass was able to slowly change form and position by altering the relative volumes of the vacuoles enclosed by the numerous thin cytoplasmic walls. In older cells, the cytoplasm may be limited to the periphery of the cell, with one huge vacuole occupying the cell center.|$|E

50|$|<b>They</b> <b>are</b> deep-water fishes, {{only living}} below 1000 m, {{and have been}} found down to 5000 m. It <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> bathypelagic (deep ocean dwelling) or benthic (bottom dwelling) as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> known to eat crabs.|$|R
50|$|A bivittatum {{has only}} been {{observed}} in five locations and it <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> present in no more than ten. This, along with the threat to their habitat from deforestation, has led them to be classified as vulnerable.|$|R
25|$|The {{fact that}} the detonations were not {{simultaneous}} enhanced their effect on the German troops. Strange acoustic effects also added to the panic – German troops on Hill 60 thought that the Kruisstraat and Spanbroekmolen mines were under Messines village, which was located well behind their front line, while some British troops <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> German counter-mines going off under the British support trenches. The combined explosion is considered to have killed more people than any other non-nuclear man-made explosion in history; it killed approximately 10,000 German soldiers between Ypres and Ploegsteert.|$|E
25|$|This {{alliance}} {{shed light}} on how the English viewed themselves and {{their role in the}} New World. While Indians {{in other areas of the}} New World (such as Hispaniola) were being treated poorly by European masters, and other nations were actively engaged in the slave trade, the English prided themselves on the <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> “liberators” who allied with these black slaves against the Spanish. Such an alliance seemed to say that the English were free of racial prejudices, even though they were actively involved in the slave trade themselves.|$|E
25|$|Bessas was {{dismissed}} from office in 554/555, leaving Martin {{as the chief}} commander. Bouzes is explicitly said to be third-in-command. In September/October, 555 {{the three of them}} and the sacellarius Rusticus went to meet Gubazes II of Lazica. Justin and Bouzes reportedly <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> to discuss a planned attack on the Sassanid forces in Onoguris (a local fort). Martin and Rusticus had Gubazes murdered, reportedly shocking Bouzes. However, he soon suspected that Justinian himself had ordered the assassination. He thus held his tongue from too much protesting.|$|E

However, there are also indications that beta cells have not been destroyed but have only become non-functional.|$|R
50|$|Rankilor is {{the family}} name of a Scottish family whose origins were Scottish. It <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a family in the Clan Bruce, and are {{descendants}} of the one-time King of Scotland, Robert the Bruce.

25|$|Irawati Karve, the Indologist and historian, {{believed}} that the Gurjars position in society and the caste system generally varied from one linguistic area of India to another. In Maharashtra, Karve <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> probably absorbed by the Rajputs and Marathas but retained some of their distinct identity. She based her theories on analysis of clan names and tradition, noting that while most Rajputs claim their origins to lie in the mythological Chandravansh or Suryavansh dynasties, {{at least two of}} the communities in the region claimed instead to be descended from the Agnivansh.|$|E
25|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} Eldad and Medad <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not worthy {{to be among}} the 70 elders, and in reward for their humility, God gave them several rewards more than the elders: (1) Whereas the elders prophesied only for the next day, Eldad and Medad prophesied what would happen for 40 years. (2) Whereas the elders did not enter the Land, Eldad and Medad did. (3) Whereas the Torah does not tell the names of the elders, it does tell the names of Eldad and Medad. (4) Whereas the prophecy of the elders ended, as it came from Moses, the prophecy of Eldad and Medad came from God.|$|E
25|$|According to McKay’s autobiographies A Long Way From Home and My Green Hills of Jamaica, {{he claimed}} the black {{intellectual}} {{was drawn to}} the Communist party because it offered independence. McKay believed that the Communists in the US had other things on their agenda, and the African-Americans were not part of that at all. He also <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> using the Negro race to fight their battles. Because of his thoughts on communism in America, he sought out help from Russia. He addressed the Communists in Russia with his speech “Report on the Negro Question” and argued that America was not fully accepting of the Negro Communists.|$|E

2500|$|Arthur David Smith, {{author of}} the Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Husserl, claims that since Edmund Husserl usually refers only to [...] "the first two" [...] of the Meditations, {{therefore}} Husserl must have <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{the only part of}} Descartes' work with any philosophical importance at all.|$|R

25|$|After a few centuries, {{the first}} {{settlement}} was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase, {{there was a}} settlement hiatus of several centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the tell. This second settlement, established in 6800 BC, perhaps represents {{the work of an}} invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten plastered human skulls, painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features. These represent either teraphim or the first example of portraiture in art history, and it is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.|$|E
25|$|Evgeni, who {{has been}} calling Wally after their date, runs to her {{apartment}} {{to check on her}} and finds her on the floor. He takes her to his home in Brooklyn and nurses her back to health. Wally finds a new hope and new direction in life. She falls in love with Evgeni, divorces William and moves on with her life. An imaginary monologue with Wallis shows the two women talking about their lives, how they <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> similar, but in the end only Wally found happiness. Through a series of letters from Wallis kept in millionaire Mohamed Al-Fayed's collection, Wally comes to realise that the Duchess was stuck in a relationship with Edward {{for the rest of her}} life. Wally leaves behind her fascination with Wallis and Edward's relationship, and learns from her doctor that she is pregnant with Evgeni's baby.|$|E
25|$|Among {{several factors}} causing the high {{death toll from}} the tsunami, one was the {{unexpectedly}} large size of the water surge. The tsunami walls at several of the affected cities were based on much smaller tsunami heights. Also, many people caught in the tsunami <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> located on high enough ground to be safe. According to conclusion made by a special committee designated by Japanese government on disaster prevention, the tsunami prevention policy by then was made to tackle only those tsunami that have been scientifically proved to occur repeatedly, and it advised in the future the policy should be changed to tackle the highest possible tsunami. As there are tsunami walls that have been overtopped by this tsunami, it have also been suggested that, other than to construct those tsunami wall up to a height that can prevent those relatively frequent tsunami, it is still necessary to teach citizens protected by those tsunami wall how to evacuate in case the largest scale tsunami come and attack those places.|$|E

25|$|The Hellfire Club {{was then}} {{able to claim}} Jean {{as one of their}} members. By using the {{combined}} telepathic powers of both Emma and the Stepford Cuckoos, they mentally tricked Jean into doing what they wanted by using images of Scott and Professor X. But the mental contact was interrupted by Scott's unusually strong physic/telepathic connection to Jean. The Stepford Cuckoos then tried to release the Phoenix Force so they could be hosts, and seemingly succeeded. Emma was shocked when she learned the true purpose was for the Inner Circle to control the vastly limitless power and energy of the Phoenix when she originally <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> trying to release the Phoenix back into space to prevent the world from destruction. Jean and Cyclops then left to fight the Phoenix, but not before Jean angrily pinned Emma to the wall and telekinetically bound Emma with iron pipes after seeing Emma passionately kiss Cyclops (leading her to suspect that Emma may have plotted to steal Cyclops from her). Jean was unable to subdue the Phoenix herself, prompting Cyclops to attack the cosmic entity, only to be struck down as Jean watched in horror. Before the Phoenix could kill Cyclops, Emma, freed by Wolverine, arrived and took the Phoenix Force into herself, seemingly dying in the process by shattering into several diamond fragments. Jean has rejoined the X-Men and her memories have since returned and appeared to have reconciled with Cyclops.|$|E
25|$|The admiral {{viewed the}} {{escalation}} of tensions between the kingdom and the United States with alarm, as he believed their defeat would be inevitable in a war because of the United States Navy's advancements between 1892 and 1896. Cervera <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unprepared and did not possess enough ships to defend their colonies. Nonetheless, he accepted the posting of commander of the Cuban squadron on 20 October 1897 and immediately organized training exercises to prepare the crews, {{since the last time}} naval drills had been carried out was 1884 (during tensions with the German Empire over the Caroline Islands). Cervera sought to correct the numerous deficiencies in the fleet within a short time period, including lack of training and inadequate supplies. He continued to face difficulties from the naval ministry of Admiral Segismundo Bermejo, however. After the explosion aboard the American battleship USS Maine in Havana harbor in February 1898, the admiral sped back to Spain to speak to the government in person, but received orders from the Admiralty while at Cape Verde to take several ships back to Cuba and prepare for war, despite the severe problems in the fleet. Cervera returned to the Caribbean and slipped past American ships to enter the harbor Santiago de Cuba on May 19, despite several mishaps and having difficulties finding a port to refuel on coal, as most of the European countries with possessions in the Caribbean remained officially neutral. His total force included the cruisers Infanta Maria Teresa, Vizacaya, Almirante Oquendo, and Cristóbal Colón, along with two destroyers.|$|E
25|$|Herodotus {{mentions}} that when Greeks defeated the Amazons at war, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons {{as they had}} been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them. But the Amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the Scythians, there they met first with a troop of horses feeding, they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians. The Scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, and they <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> men. Scythians fought a battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were women. After the battle Scythians sent young men and told them to encamp near the Amazons and to do whatsoever they should do. If the women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them. When the Amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty. One day a Scythian and an Amazon came close. They could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages but the Amazon made signs to him with her hand to come. Later the young Scythians and the Amazons joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first. The men were not able to learn the language of the Amazons, but the women learned Scythian.|$|E
