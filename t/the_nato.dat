5|$|Each country's {{delegation}} {{includes a}} Military Representative, a senior officer from each country's armed forces, {{supported by the}} International Military Staff. Together the Military Representatives form the Military Committee, a body responsible for recommending to NATO's political authorities those measures considered necessary for the common defence of <b>the</b> <b>NATO</b> area. Its principal role is to provide direction and advice on military policy and strategy. It provides guidance on military matters to <b>the</b> <b>NATO</b> Strategic Commanders, whose representatives attend its meetings, and {{is responsible for the}} overall conduct of the military affairs of the Alliance under the authority of the Council. The Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>NATO</b> Military Committee is Petr Pavel of the Czech Republic, since 2015.|$|E

5000|$|... 7.62×51mm NATO: This was <b>the</b> {{standard}} <b>NATO</b> rifle round {{until its}} replacement by the 5.56×45mm. It is currently <b>the</b> standard <b>NATO</b> sniper rifle and medium machinegun chambering. In the 1950s it was <b>the</b> standard <b>NATO</b> cartridge for rifles, but recoil and weight proved problematic {{for the new}} battle rifle designs such as the FN FAL. Standardized commercially as the 308 Winchester.|$|R
5|$|Pakistani {{authorities}} {{tried to}} contact their NATO counterparts {{in an effort to}} inform them of the situation but the Pakistani request reportedly failed to reach the attacking force. The helicopters returned a second time engaging Boulder border post again. A short while later communication with <b>the</b> <b>NATO</b> commanders was established and the attack was called off. All casualties were from the initial attack on the Volcano border post. Later, Major General Abbas expressed that it was beyond comprehension why <b>the</b> <b>NATO</b> forces returned to attack the second time.|$|E
5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} {{was designed}} {{in response to}} NATO requests for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. According to <b>the</b> <b>NATO</b> requirement, the new cartridge was to have greater range, accuracy, and terminal performance than the 9×19mm cartridge. Additionally, {{it was to be}} capable of penetrating body armor. FN Herstal responded to <b>the</b> <b>NATO</b> requirement by developing the 5.7×28mm cartridge and two associated weapons: the FN P90 personal defense weapon (PDW) and FN Five-seven pistol.|$|E
5|$|The Central Intelligence Agency {{analysed}} {{the effects}} of Operation Deliberate Force and Operations Maestral 2 and Sana, and noted that <b>the</b> <b>NATO</b> air campaign did not degrade VRS combat capability as much as was expected, because the airstrikes were never primarily directed at field-deployed units but at command and control infrastructure. This analysis noted that, while <b>the</b> <b>NATO</b> air campaign did degrade VRS capabilities, the final offensives by the HV, HVO and the ARBiH did the most damage. The analysis further concluded that the ground offensives, rather than <b>the</b> <b>NATO</b> bombardment, were responsible for bringing the Bosnian Serbs to the negotiation table and the war to its end. However, author Robert C. Owen argues that the HV would not have advanced as rapidly as it did had NATO not intervened and hampered the VRS defence by denying it long-range communications.|$|E
50|$|In 1954, in Ottawa (Canada), <b>the</b> <b>NATO's</b> Experts Commission {{approved}} the foreground of 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge. Three years later, it finalized the specifications required for this ammunition. Subsequently, in 1962, this rule was changed.|$|R
5000|$|Proponents {{assert that}} the Grendel is a middle ground between <b>the</b> 5.56×45mm <b>NATO</b> and <b>the</b> 7.62×51mm <b>NATO.</b> It retains greater {{terminal}} energy at extended ranges than either of these cartridges due to its higher ballistic coefficient.|$|R
50|$|Its {{deployment}} was a {{major cause}} of <b>the</b> <b>NATOs</b> Double-Track Decision, which led to the deployment of more medium-range nuclear weapons in Western Europe. The RSD-10 was withdrawn from service under the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>NATO</b> {{intervention}} in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992 and <b>the</b> <b>NATO</b> bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 resulted in strained relations between Serbia and NATO. Relations were further strained following Kosovo's {{declaration of independence}} in 2008 while a protectorate of the United Nations with security support from NATO. However, Serbia was invited and joined the Partnership for Peace programme during the 2006 Riga summit and in 2008, was invited to enter the intensified dialogue programme whenever the country is ready.|$|E
5|$|The {{body that}} sets broad {{strategic}} goals for NATO is <b>the</b> <b>NATO</b> Parliamentary Assembly (NATO-PA) which meets at the Annual Session, {{and one other}} time during the year, and is the organ that directly interacts with the parliamentary structures of the national governments of the member states which appoint Permanent Members, or ambassadors to NATO. <b>The</b> <b>NATO</b> Parliamentary Assembly {{is made up of}} legislators from the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance as well as thirteen associate members. Karl A. Lamers, German Deputy Chairman of the Defence Committee of the Bundestag {{and a member of the}} Christian Democratic Union, became president of the assembly in 2010. It is however officially a different structure from NATO, and has as aim to join together deputies of NATO countries in order to discuss security policies on <b>the</b> <b>NATO</b> Council.|$|E

5000|$|In 1953, <b>the</b> 7.62×51mm <b>NATO</b> rifle {{cartridge}} [...] {{was selected as}} <b>the</b> first standard <b>NATO</b> {{rifle cartridge}}. At the time of selection, there had been criticism that <b>the</b> 7.62×51mm <b>NATO</b> was too powerful for lightweight modern service rifles, causing excessive recoil, and {{that as a result}} it did not allow for sufficient automatic rate of fire from hand-held weapons in modern combat.|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> <b>NATO's</b> {{operation}} against Yugoslavia 83rd fighter {{squadron of}} Yugoslavian Air Forces {{was based in}} Slatina.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>NATO</b> council {{declared}} {{the attacks on}} the United States were an attack on all NATO nations which satisfied Article 5 of <b>the</b> <b>NATO</b> charter. This marked the first invocation of Article 5, which had been written during the Cold War with an attack by the Soviet Union in mind. Australian Prime Minister John Howard who was in Washington D.C. during the attacks invoked Article IV of the ANZUS treaty. The Bush administration announced a War on Terror, with the stated goals of bringing bin Laden and al-Qaeda to justice and preventing the emergence of other terrorist networks. These goals would be accomplished by imposing economic and military sanctions against states harboring terrorists, and increasing global surveillance and intelligence sharing.|$|E

5|$|De Gaulle {{decided that}} France, though {{formally}} remaining a member, {{would no longer}} participate in <b>the</b> <b>NATO</b> military organization. This caused a rift between France and West Germany, which then started to emphasize standardization with American equipment, especially in armament, and to follow the new NATO policy to use multifuel diesel engines. German defence minister Franz Josef Strauss began to oppose the common tank project. In July 1963, the defence committee of the German Bundesrat decided to procure a purely national tank. In response, the same month the French government decided likewise.|$|E
