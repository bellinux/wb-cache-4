5|$|Three managers, Billy Martin, Dick Howser and Bob Lemon, {{managed the}} Yankees during their World Series Championship season of 1978.

5|$|After a 71-win 1991 season, the Yankees {{replaced}} their incumbent manager, Stump Merrill, with Buck Showalter, who {{increased the}} playing time given to young players. While the 1992 Yankees were 20 games behind the AL East winner, offseason acquisitions—third baseman Wade Boggs, pitcher Jimmy Key, and outfielder Paul O'Neill—helped the 1993 team to an 88–74 record and New York's highest finish (second) in seven seasons. By 1994, the Yankees had progressed {{to the point}} where they led the AL with a 70–43 record going into the homestretch of the regular season. Their campaign was cut short by a players' strike, which resulted in the cancellation of <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> <b>and</b> 1994 World Series. Many media members believed that the Yankees might have reached the World Series if not for the strike. A year later, the team reached <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> <b>and</b> gave Mattingly his first career postseason appearance by winning the first AL wild card berth, but it was eliminated in a five-game Division Series (ALDS) against the Seattle Mariners.|$|E

5|$|A new {{professional}} indoor lacrosse league {{was created}} in the 1970s with the formation of the original National Lacrosse League. This league opened in 1974 with teams in Montreal, Toronto, Rochester, Syracuse, Philadelphia, and Maryland. For the 1975 season, Rochester moved to Boston, Syracuse moved to Quebec City, and Toronto moved to Long Island. Thus, by its second year, the original NLL was playing in all major league arenas: the Colisée de Québec, the Montreal Forum, the Boston Garden, Nassau Coliseum, the Spectrum, and the Capital Centre. When the two wealthier '75 NLL franchises, Philadelphia and Maryland, finished out of <b>the</b> <b>playoffs,</b> <b>and</b> with Montreal losing access to the fabled Montreal Forum in the upcoming season due to the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games, the league folded after two seasons due to financial uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} MLS Cup with Columbus in 2008, Schmid {{was hired by}} the {{expansion}} Seattle Sounders as their first head coach. From 2009 to 2016, Schmid led the Sounders to seven playoff appearances, four Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup titles, and an MLS Supporters' Shield in 2014. After lackluster performances in <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> <b>and</b> missteps {{during the first half of}} the 2016 season, Schmid left the club on mutual terms and was replaced by Brian Schmetzer as interim head coach. Schmid joined ESPN as a studio analyst and was named the head coach of Los Angeles once again in 2017, replacing Curt Onalfo.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the regular}} season, the team which has the most points is awarded the title of regular season champion. The league in the past {{generally}} takes a several week break between the regular season and postseason. As with the regular season, the format of the playoffs has varied from year to year. In the 2009–10 season the top four teams advanced to <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> <b>and</b> play two best-of-five rounds. The league scheduled {{the end of the}} regular season and postseason around the Olympic break. In each round the higher ranked team from the regular season will receive a home-ice advantage and the series will begin play and have the majority of games play in their rink.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2014 season, the Phillies signed Mayberry to a {{guaranteed}} $1.5875 million contract. Mayberry entered the season {{a member of}} the Phillies bench who some writers thought was not worth his salary, but made the opening day roster. Mayberry was successful early in the season, particularly as a pinch hitter – as of June 13, he was 9-for-19 with three home runs and 11 RBIs. He also started several games at first base, predominantly against left-handed pitchers. This success led some to suggest the Mayberry would have value in a potential trade, as the Phillies were not expected to make <b>the</b> <b>playoffs,</b> <b>and</b> thus might prefer to get a prospect for future seasons. However, some attributed Mayberry's success {{to the fact that the}} Phillies used him in an appropriate role, rather than trying to utilize him every day.|$|E
5|$|Chicago {{finished}} {{the season with}} an NFC best 13–3 record and advanced to the second Super Bowl in franchise history. They defeated the Seattle Seahawks 27-24 in the divisional round of <b>the</b> <b>playoffs,</b> <b>and</b> the New Orleans Saints 39-14 in the NFC Championship game to advance to Super Bowl XLI. The team excelled on defense, ranking third in fewest points allowed (255) and second in fewest points allowed per drive. They also ranked second in scoring (427 points), although only tenth in points per offensive drive thanks to a league leading 65 points scored on defensive or special teams plays.|$|E
5|$|During the strike-shortened 1982 season, {{only nine}} regular season games were played, and a {{modified}} playoff format was instituted. Divisional play was ignored (there were some cases where division rivals had both games {{wiped out by}} the strike, although each division ultimately sent at least one team to <b>the</b> <b>playoffs),</b> <b>and</b> the top eight teams from each conference (based on W-L-T record) were advanced to the playoffs. As a result, this became {{the first time that}} teams with losing records qualified for the playoffs: the 4–5 Cleveland Browns and the 4–5 Detroit Lions.|$|E
50|$|The 1973-74 Chicago Cougars {{season was}} the Chicago Cougars' second season of {{operation}} in the World Hockey Association. The team qualified for <b>the</b> <b>playoff</b> <b>and</b> won two <b>playoff</b> series {{to make it to}} the Avco Cup Final before losing to the Houston Aeros.|$|R

Kemp was told that if he kept playing his ankle could break and leave him with chronic problems {{for the rest of}} his career. He was shut down, and the team announced he would not be available for <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> <b>and</b> would have surgery to repair the problem. Kemp suffered an articular talar injury requiring microfracture surgery to his talus bone.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the trade}} proved highly {{beneficial}} for Robertson. After being stuck with an under-performing team the last six years, he now was paired with the young Lew Alcindor, who would years later become the all-time NBA scoring leader as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. With Alcindor in the low post and Robertson running the backcourt, the Bucks charged to a league-best 66–16 record, including a then-record 20-game win streak, a dominating 12–2 record in <b>the</b> <b>playoffs,</b> <b>and</b> crowned their season with the NBA title by sweeping the Baltimore Bullets 4–0 in the 1971 NBA Finals. For {{the first time in}} his career, Robertson had won an NBA championship.|$|E
5|$|In 1993–94, Anderson played 73 {{games with}} the Maple Leafs before being traded to the New York Rangers for Mike Gartner. In New York, Anderson was reunited with many of his former {{teammates}} from his days in Edmonton. The Rangers featured six former Oilers, including future Hall of Famer and Anderson's long-time friend and linemate Mark Messier. The Rangers qualified for <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> <b>and</b> were able {{to advance to the}} Finals. Matched up against the Vancouver Canucks, the Rangers defeated them in seven games. This was the Rangers' first Stanley Cup victory since 1940. After being held scoreless in the previous rounds, Anderson scored three playoff goals in the Finals, two of them being game-winners. This would be Anderson's sixth Stanley Cup victory.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} 1958–59 NBA season, the Celtics got revenge on their opposition, powered by an inspired Cousy, who averaged 20.0 points, 5.5 rebounds and a league-high 8.6 assists a game, won another assists title and {{another pair of}} All-NBA First Team and All-Star team nominations. Late in the season, Cousy reasserted his playmaking dominance by setting an NBA record with 28 assists {{in a game against}} the Minneapolis Lakers. While that record was broken 19 years later, Cousy also set a record for 19 assists in a half which has never been broken. The Celtics stormed through <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> <b>and,</b> behind Cousy's 51 total assists (still a record for a four-game NBA Finals series), defeated the Minneapolis Lakers in the first 4–0 sweep ever in the 1959 NBA Finals.|$|E
