5|$|Meeting Lennon {{had been}} a shock for Harry, as Lennon often dressed like a Teddy boy, and was a {{disruptive}} influence at the college. Despite his misgivings about Lennon, Harry introduced him to Sutcliffe, who was a small, softly-spoken and shy student, who had painted a portrait of Harry. The three often spent time together at the Ye Cracke pub in Rice Street, or on the <b>top</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jacaranda club (run by Williams, who later managed the Beatles). Harry met his then 16-year-old future wife-to-be, Virginia Sowry, at the club. Harry, Lennon, Sutcliffe and Rod Murray saw the poet Royston Ellis at Liverpool University in June 1960.

5|$|The monks' {{dormitory}} {{was on the}} <b>top</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east range, a long {{room with}} a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still {{be seen on the}} transept wall) which ran the length of the building. This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common life changed, the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was {{at the north end of}} the dormitory, preumably located for security at night.|$|E
5|$|Internally, {{the ground}} floor of the west wing housed the dining room, service areas and led through to the kitchen and bakehouse. The service area was fitted with a {{mezzanine}} floor to provide sleeping facilities for male servants; the sleeping quarters for female servants were on the <b>top</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mansion to keep the two sexes a good distance away from each other. On the same level, the east wing had a study with ante-room set in the northwest corner, a boudoir, two drawing rooms and a billiard room. An expansive library, divided into sections by pillars, was between the boudoir and study, beside the large bay window. The first floor, accessed via the main staircase positioned within the entrance hall, had all the family bedrooms, and featured balconies. Hip baths were carried to the bedrooms each evening as no bathrooms were incorporated. Cubitt had furniture workshops in London where the majority of the mansion's furnishings and fittings were crafted from mahogany. Nurseries were on the top floor beside the female servant accommodation. Around thirty rooms made up the basement, among them a smoking room where editions of Punch and The Illustrated London News were supplied as reading material. The remaining rooms on the basement level were workshops, wine cellars and individual parlours for the butler, housekeeper and other principal servants, together with general storerooms.|$|E
