5|$|In {{automatic}} test pattern generation, finding cliques can help <b>to</b> <b>bound</b> {{the size of}} a test set. In bioinformatics, clique-finding algorithms have been used to infer evolutionary trees, predict protein structures, and find closely interacting clusters of proteins. Listing the cliques in a dependency graph is an important step in the analysis of certain random processes. In mathematics, Keller's conjecture on face-to-face tiling of hypercubes was disproved by , who used a clique-finding algorithm on an associated graph to find a counterexample.|$|E

50|$|In circulation, 97.0 to 99.5% of {{testosterone}} is <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> plasma proteins, with 0.5 to 3.0% unbound. It is tightly <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> SHBG and weakly to albumin.

Unlike testosterone that is <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> SHBG, bioavailable testosterone is <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> plasma proteins weakly enough such that, similarly to free testosterone, it may be biologically active, at least to some extent. When referenced collectively (i.e., free, bioavailable, and SHBG-bound), circulating testosterone is referred to as total testosterone.|$|R

25|$|While the {{admissibility}} criterion guarantees {{an optimal}} solution path, {{it also means}} that A* must examine all equally meritorious paths to find the optimal path. To compute approximate shortest paths, it is possible to speed up the search at the expense of optimality by relaxing the admissibility criterion. Oftentimes we want <b>to</b> <b>bound</b> this relaxation, so that we can guarantee that the solution path is no worse than (1 + ε) times the optimal solution path. This new guarantee is referred to as ε-admissible.|$|E
25|$|White also {{discussed}} the District of Columbia's lengthy history regarding {{the regulation of}} wharves and docks. In his view, the city's treatment of the wharves demonstrated that the wharves were private property on private riverbed land, not private property licensed to be emplaced on a riverbed held in the public trust. White interpreted Potomac Steam-Boat Co. as superimposing an easement on top of existing riparian water rights.

25|$|It is of {{importance}} {{in the analysis of}} geometric algorithms <b>to</b> <b>bound</b> the number of k-sets of a planar point set, or equivalently the number of k-levels of a planar line arrangement, a problem first studied by Lovász (1971) and Erdős et al. (1973). The best known upper bound for this problem is O(nk1/3), as was shown by Tamal Dey (1998) using the crossing number inequality of Ajtai, Chvátal, Newborn, and Szemerédi. However, the best known lower bound is far from Dey's upper bound: it is (n exp(c (logk)1/2)) for some constant c, as shown by Toth (2001).|$|E

As a consequence, {{it is known that}} if a finitely presented group G given by a finite presentation (∗) has computable Dehn function Dehn(n), then the word problem for G is solvable with non-deterministic time complexity Dehn(n) and deterministic time complexity Exp(Dehn(n)). However, in general there is no reasonable bound on the Dehn function of a finitely presented group in terms of the deterministic time complexity of the word problem and the gap between the two functions can be quite large.|$|E
25|$|The Narrows {{were most}} likely formed about 6,000 {{years ago at the}} end of the last ice age. Previously, Staten Island and Long Island were connected, {{preventing}} the Hudson River from terminating via the Narrows. At that time, the Hudson River emptied into the Atlantic Ocean through a more westerly course through parts of present-day northern New Jersey, along the eastern side of the Watchung Mountains <b>to</b> <b>Bound</b> Brook, New Jersey and then on into the Atlantic Ocean via Raritan Bay. A buildup of water in the Upper New York Bay eventually allowed the Hudson River to break through previous land mass that was connecting Staten Island and Brooklyn to form the Narrows as it exists today. This allowed the Hudson River to find a shorter route to the Atlantic Ocean via its present course between New Jersey and New York City.|$|E
25|$|Styles {{filled in}} for Angle and teamed with The Main Event Mafia in a five-on-five tag team match against Aces & Eights at , {{securing}} the victory {{for his team}} by pinning Devon, though he later {{said that he had}} not joined The New Main Evet Mafia. On the August 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, Styles defeated Bobby Roode in a Bound for Glory series match to earn seven points. The following week on Impact Wrestling, Styles won a gauntlet battle royal match by last eliminating Daniels to gain twenty points and secure the top spot in the Bound for Glory series. At , Styles defeated Austin Aries in the semi-finals and later defeated Magnus in the finals to win the 2013 Bound for Glory Series and become the number one contender for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Bound for Glory. The following week on Impact Wrestling, Styles claimed he was no longer under contract with TNA and insulted Dixie Carter, who responded by saying that Styles was not a great wrestler. In the weeks leading up <b>to</b> <b>Bound</b> for Glory, Styles continued to appear on Impact Wrestling despite not having a contract with the company, but he would defeat Bully Ray at Bound for Glory, despite interference from Aces & Eights and Carter, to win his second TNA World Heavyweight Championship and fifth world title in the company overall. Styles made his first televised title defense on the following episode of Impact Wrestling, defeating Ray in a rematch after interference from Mr. Anderson, after which he refused Carter's new contract offer and walked out of TNA with the title. On October 29, TNA vacated the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the December 2 taping of Impact Wrestling which aired on January 2, Styles returned to TNA with his championship to confront Carter and Magnus (who had won a tournament to crown the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion), with Styles challenging Magnus to a title unification match on next weeks episode of Impact Wrestling, which Magnus accepted. Magnus won to unify both titles after interference from eight other wrestlers on Magnus' behalf and Sting interfering on Styles' behalf in what would be Styles' final match with TNA. On December 8 it was reported that contract negotiations between Styles and TNA had broken down and that Styles would be leaving the promotion, becoming a free agent effective December 17 and ending his near twelve-year association with the company.|$|E
