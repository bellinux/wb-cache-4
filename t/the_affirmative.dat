5|$|Heavy {{fighting}} {{broke out}} on the Plain of Jars as the members of each political grouping chose sides. Souvanna called upon the U.S. for support and was answered in <b>the</b> <b>affirmative</b> by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was eager to support a rightist/neutralist alliance in Laos. In November 1963 General Maxwell D. Taylor, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had proposed that U.S. armed reconnaissance missions be conducted over Laos {{as part of a}} two phase program that would warn Hanoi of U.S. determination to support the Saigon government. The missions were to take place along North Vietnamese infiltration routes then developing in the Laotian panhandle.|$|E

5|$|Speaking in Parliament on 12 February 2009, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann {{posed the}} {{question}} of whether the right to vote is a constitutional one and suggested that the Law Minister obtain an advisory opinion to clarify the point. This issue was briefly dealt with by the Minister who simply answered it in <b>the</b> <b>affirmative,</b> rendering the need for a resolution by the constitutional tribunal nugatory. Thio subsequently expressed the view that it would be desirable to ask the Constitutional Tribunal to give its authoritative opinion as the courts are the final arbiter on questions of constitutionality in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|A {{public enquiry}} {{was held in}} 1873, to {{determine}} whether it would be advantageous for the city to be administered by a municipal corporation. The result being in <b>the</b> <b>affirmative,</b> the city council, sometimes archaically called the corporation, was founded by a Charter of Incorporation dated 17 March 1874, under the government of a mayor, six aldermen and 18 councillors. Something of an anomaly, the Parliamentary Boundary Commission of 1868 had decided that the urban parts of Fletton and Woodston were so involved in Peterborough that they ought to be in the borough and added the newly built-up portions of these parishes to the parliamentary constituency. In local matters they were still in Huntingdonshire and, as the City of Peterborough did not extend south of the River Nene, the full title of the new municipality was the City and Borough of Peterborough and its inhabitants, citizens and burgesses.|$|E

Fisher mollified him and in 1916 Charlton proved his loyalty to the new Labor leader Billy Hughes by voting for Hughes' conscription referendum bill, {{even though he was}} vehemently opposed to conscription and fought hard against it. However, Charlton seemed to accept <b>the</b> <b>affirmative</b> result of the referendum and again proved his loyalty to Hughes by defending him when he became the target of caucus criticism. Charlton attempted to deflect attacks made on Hughes to a party conference, but Hughes left the party before a decision could be made.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 May, Howe sent a signal to all his captains asking if they {{considered}} their ships ready for combat. All but Caesar replied in <b>the</b> <b>affirmative</b> and Howe pushed his ships after the retreating French. Despite holding the weather gage, Howe's pursuit was soon hampered by descending fog, and unable to see or {{come to grips with}} the enemy throughout the whole day, the admiral feared he may have lost his opportunity for battle. However, by 31 May the fog had cleared and the French were still within sight to the north. To the surprise of the British, none of the 26 battleships in the French fleet appeared to show battle damage, whereas many of the British ships were nursing damaged rigging and battered hulls. Villaret had made use of the fog to reorganise his force, losing Montagnard and the frigate Seine to the convoy but gaining the independently sailing battleship Trente-un-Mai and Nielly's squadron of Sans Pareil, Trajan, and Téméraire. Villaret had also dispatched the battered Indomptable for home, escorted by an undamaged French ship.|$|E

5|$|In 1268/69, Baybars took hostage {{some of the}} Bedouin chieftains' sons as {{leverage}} {{to ensure that their}} fathers did not defect to the Ilkhanids. That same year, he halved Isa's annual grant of 130,000 silver dirhams. Baybars' actions backfired when Isa made it apparent that he would defect to the Ilkhanids; the Bedouin tribes' defection to the Ilkhanids was a constant possibility and gave Isa considerable leverage with Baybars. News of this turn of events prompted Baybars to secretly rush to Syria from Egypt on 15 September 1270 and secure Isa's commitment to the Mamluks. He arrived in Hama on 4 October and summoned Isa. During the meeting, Baybars asked Isa whether rumors of his planned defection were true and Isa answered in <b>the</b> <b>affirmative.</b> Afterward, Baybars honored him and agreed to free the hostages, restore Isa's grant, and distribute to the Bedouin tribes large amounts of wheat. As a result, Isa swore an oath of loyalty to Baybars and afterward participated in every Mamluk campaign against the Ilkhanids. The first of these campaigns occurred soon after Isa's meeting with Baybars, when he led raids against the Ilkhanids in Edessa and Harran in southern Anatolia.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{founding}} of the republic, most of the powers of the Curiate Assembly were transferred to the Centuriate Assembly and the Tribal Assembly. While it then fell into disuse, it did retain some theoretical powers, most importantly, the power to ratify elections of the top-ranking Roman Magistrates (Consuls and Praetors) by passing the statute that gave them their legal command authority, the lex curiata de imperio. In practice, however, they actually received this authority from the Centuriate Assembly (which formally elected them), and as such, this functioned as nothing more than a reminder of Rome's regal heritage. Other acts that the Curiate Assembly voted on were mostly symbolic and usually in <b>the</b> <b>affirmative.</b> At one point, possibly as early as 218 BC, the Curiate Assembly's thirty Curia were abolished, and replaced with thirty lictors, one from each of the original Patrician clans. Since the Curia had always been organized {{on the basis of the}} Roman family, the Curiate Assembly actually retained jurisdiction over clan matters even after the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC. Under the presidency of the Pontifex Maximus, it witnessed wills and ratified adoptions, inaugurated certain priests, and transferred citizens from Patrician class to Plebeian class (or vice versa). In 44 BC, for example, it ratified the will of Julius Caesar, and with it Caesar's adoption of his nephew Gaius Octavian (the future Roman emperor Augustus) as his son and heir. However, this might not have been the comitia curiata but instead the comitia calata.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the Buddhist {{doctrine}} of rebirth, the previous existences of Koṇḍañña are described in Buddhist texts. They repeatedly show a theme of Koṇḍañña having displayed religious inclinations in previous rebirths, many of which involve experiences with previous rebirths of the Buddha and his other leading disciplines. This is a common theme among the leading disciples, {{all of whom had}} many encounters with the future Gautama Buddha in previous lives, and is consistent with the Buddhist concepts of cause and effect and karma. In Pali language Theravada literature, Koṇḍañña is said to have begun striving for enlightenment in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, the 13th Buddha. The son of a wealthy householder at Hamsavati, Koṇḍañña saw the monk who was the first disciple of Padmuttara Buddha. Koṇḍañña's previous rebirth bestowed on the Buddha and the sangha and wished that he was to be the first disciple of a future Buddha. Padumuttara is said to have prophesied the fulfilment of this in the era of Gautama Buddha, 1000 aeons into the future. After the passing of Padmuttara Buddha, Koṇḍañña constructed a jewelled chamber inside the cetiya in which the relics were stored and also made an offering of jewel festoons. The Apadana offers a variant on this reincarnation. It states that Koṇḍañña {{was the first person to}} offer a meal to Padumuttara and became a deva in the Tusita world. It further says and that during the time of Vipassī Buddha, Koṇḍañña was a householder named Mahakala who offered the Buddha the first fruits of his field in their nine stages of production. The Mahavastu gives another account explaining the origin of Koṇḍañña's vow to attain arahanthood in his final rebirth. This account asserts that he was a potter at Rajagaha in a previous existence. A Paccekabuddha who was suffering from biliousness sought shelter in the potter's hut and was cured. In time, several more Paccekabuddhas came to visit the hut to inquire about their colleagues health status. The potter asked which of them had realised the dharma first, to which the patient answered in <b>the</b> <b>affirmative.</b> Thereupon the potter made his vow.|$|E

25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Affirmative</b> team {{presents}} a plan, they take upon themselves the Burden of Proof {{to prove that}} their plan should be adopted.

25|$|Counterplans: The {{negative}} {{can present}} a counter solution to <b>the</b> <b>affirmative</b> case's problem {{which may or}} may not go against the resolution. This is generally accompanied by on-case arguments that the counterplan does not solve, as well as disadvantages that link to <b>the</b> <b>affirmative</b> case but not the counterplan. Counterplans narrow down the on-case arguments to: advantages the counterplan can not borrow, the inherency, and the solvency. Upon the negative running a counterplan, most debates boil down to the solvency of <b>the</b> <b>affirmative</b> case, and the disadvantages. Counterplans must be competitive with the plan. This means that the counterplan must either be mutually exclusive with <b>the</b> <b>affirmative</b> (for example, one cannot both increase oil production (a hypothetical plan) and decrease oil production (a hypothetical counterplan) or be undesirable in conjunction with the plan (the negative must win that the inclusion of the plan would cause some form of harm that the counterplan alone would avoid).|$|E

25|$|Kritiks: The {{negative}} {{can claim}} that <b>the</b> <b>affirmative</b> {{is guilty of}} a certain mindset or assumption that should be grounds for rejection or a different mutually exclusive alternative to the Affirmatives plan. Kritiks are sometimes a reason to reject the entire affirmative advocacy without evaluating its policy; other times, kritiks can be evaluated within the same framework for evaluation as <b>the</b> <b>affirmative</b> case. Examples of some areas of literature for kritiks include biopower, racism, centralized government, and anthropocentrism. Kritiks arose in the early 1990s, with the first kritiks based in deconstructionist philosophy about the intrinsic ambiguity of language and were championed by debaters Shane Stafford and Bill Shanahan. Kritiks today have evolved to sometimes include <b>the</b> <b>affirmative</b> advocacy within their alternatives. These kritiks argue that the ontological or epistemological assumptions behind <b>the</b> <b>affirmative</b> are flawed {{and ought to be}} rejected, but the plan itself is fine. For example, an affirmative could argue that {{it would be good to}} reduce our nuclear stockpile to avoid global proliferation out of fear of rogue states acquiring nuclear weapons.
