25|$|Kenny's {{success was}} controversial; many Australian doctors (and the British Medical Association) {{questioned}} her results and methodology.

Kenny replied publicly, fiercely taking Cilento <b>to</b> <b>task</b> <b>for</b> his criticisms (unusual from a self-taught bush nurse at that time in Australia). This response caused a contentious relationship among Kenny, Cilento, the BMA and the Australian Medical Association (AMA).|$|E

25|$|While {{labor force}} {{participation}} rate {{sheds light on}} how many women work in the formal sectors of the economy, it says nothing about the type of work or the stable presence {{of women in the}} labor force. Countries such as Bangladesh and Indonesia, when female labor force participation rate or the ratio of male to female workers or similar indicators are considered, appear to have substantial female involvement in their economies. However, very few of the women in these nations have salaried work which means they may go through cycles of short periods of work punctuated by long periods of unemployment. Alternatively, these women may be shuffled from task <b>to</b> <b>task</b> <b>for</b> different employers and never develop a stable basis at a particular firm or within a particular field.|$|E
25|$|A second {{exception}} {{is to be}} found in the works of researchers who have employed resources from ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism in studying legal settings. This type of research is clearly sociological rather than socio-legal research because it continually engages in debate with other theoretical traditions in sociology. Max Travers' doctoral thesis about the work of a firm of criminal lawyers took other sociologists, and especially Marxists, <b>to</b> <b>task</b> <b>for</b> not addressing or respecting how lawyers and clients understand their own actions (a standard argument used by ethnomethodologists in debates with structural traditions in the discipline). It also, however, explored issues raised by legal thinkers in their critique of structural traditions in sociology of law: the extent to which social science can address the content of legal practice.|$|E
25|$|On 21 November 1492, off {{the coast}} of Cuba, Pinzón failed to follow a direct order of Columbus to change course. He {{probably}} sailed off on his own trying to make individual discoveries and to find treasure, although Cesáreo Fernández Duro argues that the initial separation may have been accidental, a matter of missed signals. (Asensio takes Fernández Duro strongly <b>to</b> <b>task</b> <b>for</b> not adequately explaining the length of the separation; Fernández Duro responds that Pinzón simply continued the prior course, and if Columbus wanted, he should have had a pretty fair idea where to find him over the next several days.) During his separate travels he discovered new land; while all of the island geography of the first voyage is open to question, it is believed that the land was Haiti.|$|E

25|$|In October 1570, as {{a result}} of the Peace of Saint Germain, Ferrières was able to return to Paris. After some of his {{servants}} were attacked there, he went to Boubige in Poitou. In February 1572 he was at La Ferté, but shortly thereafter returned to Paris, where he remained in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, mistrusting the King's promises for the safety of the Huguenots. After an attempted assassination of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, Ferrières took the King <b>to</b> <b>task</b> <b>for</b> the 'cowardice' of the attack, and the following day urged that the Admiral, and all Protestants, should leave Paris. His advice was ignored, and the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre occurred that night. Ferrières, his brother-in-law, Jean de La Fin, and ten others, including according to Arber, Richard Eden, escaped, fleeing first to La Ferté, and from thence to the coast where they found a ship to take them to England. Ferrières arrived in London on 7 September 1573.|$|E
25|$|Howard Robinson is {{a philosopher}} who has {{concentrated}} his research within {{the philosophy of}} mind. Taking what has been through {{the latter part of}} the last century an unfashionable stance, he has consistently argued against those explanations of sensory experience that would reduce them to physical origins. He has never regarded the theory of sense-data as refuted, but has set out to refute in turn the objections which so many have considered to be conclusive. The version of the theory of sense-data he defends takes what is before consciousness in perception to be qualia as mental presentations that are causally linked to external entities, but which are not physical in themselves. Unlike the philosophers so far mentioned, he is therefore a dualist, one who takes both matter and mind to have real and metaphysically distinct natures. His books (particularly Matter and Sense and Perception) are characterized by the thoroughness with which he deals with the arguments of opposing philosophers, thus setting a professional example that it would be well for his opponents to follow (for there has been a tendency to take for granted that the theory of sense-data is wholly obsolescent). In one of his most recent articles he takes the physicalist <b>to</b> <b>task</b> <b>for</b> ignoring the fact that sensory experience can be entirely free of representational character. He cites phosphenes as a stubborn example (phosphenes are flashes of neural light that result either from sudden pressure in the brain—as induced, for example, by intense coughing, or through direct physical pressure on the retina), and points out that it is grossly counter-intuitive to argue that these are not visual experiences on a par with open-eye seeing.|$|E

500|$|In September 1941, Oliphant {{met with}} Lawrence and Oppenheimer at Berkeley, where they {{showed him the}} site for the new [...] cyclotron.

Lawrence had already thought about the problem of separating the fissile isotope uranium-235 from uranium-238, a process known today as uranium enrichment. Separating uranium isotopes was difficult because the two isotopes have very nearly identical chemical properties, and could only be separated gradually using their small mass differences. [...] Separating isotopes with a mass spectrometer was a technique Oliphant had pioneered with lithium in 1934.|$|E
500|$|In {{examining}} {{case histories}} of blue-discharge veterans, the committee found that [...] "the procedure {{lends itself to}} dismissals based on prejudice and antagonism". Further, the committee found {{that the effects of}} a blue discharge [...] "differ little from those of a dishonorable discharge...the discharged man finds it difficult to get or keep a job. The suspicion of society is aroused against him, all the worse in some ways for carrying an atmosphere of mystery." [...] The report said that [...] "nothing could more clearly prove the anomalous and illogical and disingenuous nature of the blue discharge than this policy of the Veterans Administration". The committee called the system for dealing with blue-ticket veterans [...] "a squeeze play between the war department and the veterans' administration" [...] and took the agency <b>to</b> <b>task</b> <b>for</b> assuming [...] "the right to separate the sheep from the goats" [...] and [...] "passing moral verdicts on the history of any soldier".|$|E
500|$|Anarky's {{appearance}} in Batman: Arkham Origins included a speech {{delivered at the}} conclusion of the character's story arch. The player is given the opportunity to observe Anarky after he has been defeated, and watch as the teenager enters a monologue in which he laments the downfall of society, tries to reconcile his admiration for Batman, and ultimately denounces the Caped Crusader as a false hero. Nick Dinicola of PopMatters, in comparing the game to its predecessor, Batman: Arkham City, asserted that the narrative of Origins consistently challenged Batman's ideological reasons for acting as he does, whereas City uncritically took his motivations as a given. [...] "Anarky’s wonderful speech takes Batman <b>to</b> <b>task</b> <b>for</b> the contradictions in his symbolism," [...] writes Dinicola, choosing that moment in the game as one of several examples of this theme. [...] "Considering that Batman is very explicitly a symbol of fear, Anarky is equating the rise of Batman with the downfall of society." [...] Dinicola was also of the opinion that the willingness to use characters like Anarky to scrutinize Batman's heroism, rather than simply assert it, allowed the game to ultimately prove and uphold Batman as a heroic figure in a way City could not. To Dinicola, this validated the act of challenging a superhero's traditional interpretation in service to the story.|$|E
