500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{winning the}} Grammy for Record of the Year. Take 40 Australia elaborated on the audience's {{reception at the}} July 2011 Splendour in the Grass festival, [...] "Gotye's latest song featuring Kimbra 'Somebody That I Used To Know' had become somewhat of an unofficial anthem for the festival... every car was cranking it over their speakers all day, every day... and the question on everyone's lips was whether or not Kimbra would join him on the track. Fortunately, dreams came true... he smashed out an incredible set climaxing with {{a version of the}} song with Kimbra on co-lead vocals that people couldn't stop <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> weekend long". Allmusic's Jon O'Brien felt the track was an [...] "unexpected chart-topper... is an oddball break-up song whose stuttering rhythms, reggae hooks, and hushed vocals sound like The Police as remixed by the XX".|$|E
500|$|On {{its release}} most critics {{agreed that the}} book was both scandalous and career-ending. [...] (Even with {{a quarter of the}} 1,000-page {{original}} manuscript excised, it took lawyers at Random House fourteen months to approve it for publication.) Lewis Cole, in The Nation, described it as being [...] " [...] written but spat out, a breakneck, formless performance piece...propelled by spite and vanity". Newsweek's review called it a [...] "573-page primal scream", while one Hollywood producer said it was [...] "the longest suicide note in history". In the 2003 documentary version of Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, based on Peter Biskind's 1998 anecdotal history of New Hollywood, Richard Dreyfuss recalled his initial fury at Phillips' revelations, before more circumspectly listening to [...] "a little voice inside my head [...] 'Richard, Richard, the truth was so much worse'." [...] Despite Phillips' criticisms of Steven Spielberg in the book, Spielberg nevertheless invited her to a 1997 screening of Close Encounters of the Third Kind as a way of [...] "keeping his friends close and his enemies closer." [...] Rapper Tupac Shakur mispronounces {{the title of the book}} in a Vibe Interview in 1996, stating briefly that it was one of the books he read recently. [...] "You’ll Never Work Again in Hollywood, whatever that is that they’re <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> <b>all</b> the people that slept together." ...|$|E

50|$|On October 31, 2013, Mourning was {{alongside}} Audra Kunkle on ABC Network's The View to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> things Halloween and {{to promote}} their show Oddities: San Francisco.|$|R
50|$|Two old {{servants}} {{meet and}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> the changes around them, especially those {{occurring in the}} rich family they have served. The story views decay as seen from beneath.|$|R
2500|$|While <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>All</b> Hail the King, Pearce {{revealed}} he {{had been}} thinking about the possibility of Runaways being adapted as a TV series. In August 2016, Hulu ordered a pilot along with additional scripts for a Runaways TV series written by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage. Filming will start in February 2017. [...] It was later announced that Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage were jointly hired to be co-showrunners of the series. In February 2017, Head of Marvel Television, Jeff Loeb, announced that the roster of the team had been cast with Lyrica Okano, Virginia Gardner, Allegra Acosta, Gregg Sulkin, Rhenzy Feliz, and Ariela Barer will appear in the series as Nico Minoru, Karolina Dean, Molly Hernandez, Chase Stein, Alex Wilder, and Gert Yorkes respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Psychologist Alan Downs' book The Velvet Rage {{was titled}} after the album and its {{homosexual}} content; demonstrating [...] "how {{to heal the}} trauma of being a gay man in an uncompromisingly straight world." [...] Transgender activist Janet Mock named herself after Jackson and the album's themes of sexual orientation, stating, [...] "she was so open and raw. She was talking about her sexual fluidity. She was talking about access and elitism with the velvet rope, who gets to come in, who doesn’t. She was talking about domestic violence. All of these things within this album... my mind was blown. I couldn’t believe someone was <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> of these issues that were paralleling my own life." [...] "Speaker Phone" [...] was referenced by comedian Sandra Bernhard during a monologue in [...] "I'm Still Here... Damn It!". The album was also mentioned in the Family Guy episode, [...] "And the Wiener Is..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I like company. Did {{you ever}} know {{me go to}} tea without you {{when there was a}} chance of your coming? What has Jupiter been <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> this time?" ...|$|E
50|$|Rogers <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> {{sorts of}} sports that are {{played with a}} ball (such as football, soccer and baseball). In the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, Joey Hollingsworth {{performs}} a dance with a magic ball.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so, Jerry," [...] Sam Hicks agreed. While Ben said: [...] "Waal, if we git {{through it}} will be {{something}} to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> our lives. In course there ain't no taking the horses?" ...|$|R
6000|$|There was {{something}} forlorn in the man's attitude, and Cavanagh's heart softened. [...] "Turn your horse into the corral {{and come to}} supper," [...] he commanded, with Western bluntness; [...] "we'll <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> that later." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Not if {{they were}} ever so,” said Mrs Verloc, with the equanimity of a person untroubled by {{the problem of the}} {{distribution}} of wealth, and exploring the perspective of the roadway for an omnibus of the right colour. “Certainly not. But what’s the use of <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> that? You aren’t ever hungry.” ...|$|E
60|$|Talking about eddication, {{said the}} night-watchman, thoughtfully, the finest eddication {{you can give}} a lad is to send 'im to sea. School is all right {{up to a certain}} p'int, but arter that comes the sea. I've been there myself and I know wot I'm <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> <b>All</b> that I am I owe to 'aving been to sea.|$|E
60|$|Arthur Gride {{in reply}} {{repeated}} the word 'bell' {{as loud as}} he could roar; and, his meaning being rendered further intelligible to Mrs Sliderskew's dull sense of hearing by pantomime expressive of ringing at a street-door, Peg hobbled out, after sharply demanding why he hadn't {{said there was a}} ring before, instead of <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> manner of things {{that had nothing to do}} with it, and keeping her half-pint of beer waiting on the steps.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I was a poet or a bird," [...] said Mr. Direck, [...] "I should sing. But {{being just}} a plain American citizen all I {{can do is}} just to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> I'd do if I wasn't...." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{murder case}} was being <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> over the country, because the murderers were rich kids. Boudewijn and Ewout were {{the sons of}} the {{director}} of an insurance company. Boudewijn later escaped from jail, but later was caught again.|$|R
5000|$|In an August interview, Cohon commented [...] "I don't like to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> the vandalism. I never {{expected}} people would damage them. It's unfortunate, but it's {{sort of a}} thing of the past. It seems to be over now." ...|$|R
60|$|The dragon-fly {{did come}} back, and chatted away with Tom. He {{was a little}} {{conceited}} about his fine colours and his large wings; but you know, {{he had been a}} poor dirty ugly creature all his life before; so there were great excuses for him. He was very fond of <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> the wonderful things he saw in the trees and the meadows; and Tom liked to listen to him, for he had forgotten all about them. So in a little while they became great friends.|$|E
60|$|But {{there is}} no use in <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> that. Some clever person {{has said that it}} is always the {{unexpected}} that happens, and on a calm and dispassionate survey the world does appear mainly to one as a scene of miracles. Out of Germany's strength, in whose purpose so many people refused to believe, came Poland's opportunity, in which nobody could have been expected to believe. Out of Russia's collapse emerged that forbidden thing, the Polish independence, not as a vengeful figure, the retributive shadow of the crime, but as something much more solid and more difficult to get rid of--a political necessity and a moral solution. Directly it appeared its practical usefulness became undeniable, and also the fact that, for better or worse, it was impossible {{to get rid of it}} again except by the unthinkable way of another carving, of another partition, of another crime.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} two men been <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> this time, Mr. Ross? I suppose, Mr. Corbeck {{has been telling}} you all his adventures in finding the lamps. I hope you will tell me too, some day, Mr. Corbeck; but that must not be till my poor Father is better. He would like, I am sure, to {{tell me all about}} these things himself; or to be present when I heard them." [...] She glanced sharply from one to the other. [...] "Oh, that was what you were saying as I came in? All right! I shall wait; but I hope it won't be long. The {{continuance}} of Father's condition is, I feel, breaking me down. A little while ago I felt that my nerves were giving out; so I determined to go out for a walk in the Park. I am sure it will do me good. I want you, if you will, Mr. Ross, to be with Father whilst I am away. I shall feel secure then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "First," [...] he began, [...] "I want to {{compliment}} {{you on your}} new paper. It's a good thing, and I like it. It's what's been needed in these 'ere parts a long time, and it's <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> over Chazy County." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Jack, {{you are a}} lucky fellow!" [...] Harry said, when he had finished. [...] "To {{think of}} your having gone through all those adventures and living to tell of them. Why, it will be {{something}} to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> your life." ...|$|R
50|$|All {{three of}} Mike Pougounas bands have been {{featured}} in the books of world-famous rock journalist Mick Mercer. The Flowers of Romance are the featured band in Mercer's Hex Files: The Goth Bible, while Mercer’s “Music to Die For” <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> three Pougounas bands.|$|R

50|$|Izham is {{also the}} Chairman of the Communications and Multimedia Content Forum of Malaysia (CMCF) besides being a Trustee of Yayasan 1Malaysia.

6000|$|... 'I'll {{answer for}} the house property, because Jim he {{requested}} my signed name at the foot o' some papers concernin' it. Regardin' {{the money in the}} bank, he nature-ally wouldn't like such things <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> round the parish, so he took strangers for witnesses.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very {{friendly}} terms. We {{were quite}} friends, {{and used to}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> manner of things. I was very fond of him, and never afraid of anything that he said to me. He was Nina's cousin and seemed almost to be my cousin too." ...|$|R
5000|$|For {{the first}} time in my life I know how it feels to face an existential menace. They want us to die. All of a sudden I realize what my parents were <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> those years. Patriotism, I now believe, isn't some sentimental, old conceit. It's self-preservation. I believe patriotism is central to a nation's survival. Ben Franklin said it: If we don't all hang together, we all hang separately.|$|E
5000|$|... "Tweeter and the Monkey Man" [...] {{was really}} by Tom Petty and Bob Dylan. Well, Jeff [...] and I were there too, {{but we were}} just sitting there around in the kitchen, and he was for some reason <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> this stuff that didn't make much sense to me, you know, it was that Americana kinda stuff {{and we got a}} tape {{cassette}} and put it on and then transcribed everything they were saying.|$|E
5000|$|The minor term here is mammal, {{which is}} not {{distributed}} in the minor premise [...] "All cats are mammals," [...] because this premise is only defining a property of possibly some mammals (i.e., that they're cats.) However, in the conclusion [...] "All mammals are felines," [...] mammal is distributed (it is <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> mammals being felines). It is shown to be false by any mammal {{that is not a}} feline; for example, a dog.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Petter {{was very}} willing to walk faster, and to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> that appertained to his beloved Squirrel Inn, {{and so they}} walked and talked {{until they reached the}} garden and {{disappeared}} from view behind the tall shrubbery that bordered the central path.|$|R
50|$|During that time, Nuon Chea {{was willing}} to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> phases of his {{political}} career except the three-and-a-half years of the Khmer Rouge regime. He had previously been interviewed by Western and Japanese journalists but had always denied responsibility for killing anyone in the Cambodian genocide.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind about}} that, dear," [...] Chebron said; [...] "we will <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> this afterward. The {{first thing is}} to get you away from this place. Jethro and Amuba will soon decide what is best to be done. Are there any others in the house?" ...|$|R
