5|$|The sperm whale's {{cerebrum}} is {{the largest}} in all mammalia, both in absolute and relative terms. The olfactory system is reduced, suggesting that the sperm whale has a poor sense of <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>smell.</b> By contrast, the auditory system is enlarged. The pyramidal tract is poorly developed, reflecting the reduction of its limbs.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} arthropods, chelicerates' cuticles would block out {{information}} about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch and vibration sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>smell,</b> often by means of setae.|$|E

40|$|Sweet" <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> <b>tastes</b> are {{perceptually}} similar, {{and physiological}} data indicate some commonality of central processing. However, sweet <b>tastes</b> <b>and</b> sweet <b>smells</b> {{do not provide}} interchangeable contexts in psychophysical experiments. The same sweet tastes are perceived as less intense when stronger sweet <b>tastes</b> are present, <b>and</b> they are perceived as more intense when weaker sweet tastes are present, as with sweet smells. However, complementary sets of sweet <b>tastes</b> <b>and</b> <b>smells</b> (e. g., weak sweet tastes, strong sweet smells) do not eliminate these differential context effects (DCEs). The present experiments examined, first, whether DCEs between sweet <b>tastes</b> <b>and</b> <b>smells</b> arise because of differences between odors <b>and</b> <b>tastes</b> {{in the way that}} sweetness scales with intensity as concentration rises, and, second, whether DCEs may be smaller for sweet <b>tastes</b> <b>and</b> <b>smells,</b> when contrasted with sweet <b>tastes</b> <b>and</b> nonsweet <b>smells.</b> The findings were clear: DCEs were consistently present, suggesting they are independent of perceptual similarity. These results imply that DCEs are probably not psychological in origin or centrally based; rather, they may have a subcortical locus. 10 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Chemical {{communications}} in animals {{rely on a}} variety of aspects including <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>smell.</b> Chemoreception is the physiological response of a sense organ (i.e. taste or smell) to a chemical stimulus where the chemicals act as signals to regulate the state or activity of a cell. A semiochemical is a message-carrying chemical that is meant to attract, repel, and convey information. Types of semiochemicals include pheromones and kairomones. One example is the butterfly Phengaris arion which uses chemical signals as a form of mimicry to aid in predation.|$|E
5|$|Remy is {{an idealistic}} and ambitious young rat, gifted with highly {{developed}} senses of <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>smell.</b> Inspired by his idol, the recently deceased chef Auguste Gusteau, Remy dreams {{of becoming a}} cook himself. When an old French woman discovers Remy's colony in her house and attempts to exterminate them, {{they are forced to}} flee, and Remy becomes separated from his family in the panic. He ends up in the sewers of Paris and eventually finds himself at a skylight overlooking the kitchen of Gusteau's restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Spiders a {{class of}} arachnids have four pairs of legs; a body of two segments—a {{cephalothorax}} and an abdomen. Spiders have no wings and no antennae. They have mouthparts called chelicerae which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous. They have a second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the cephalothorax. These have similar segmentation to the legs and function as <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> organs. At {{the end of each}} male pedipalp is a spoon-shaped cymbium that acts to support the copulatory organ.|$|E

5|$|The Boletus pinophilus is edible, {{and may be}} used fresh, preserved, {{dried and}} cooked {{in a manner similar}} to that of other edible boletes. It is highly {{regarded}} and can be quite expensive in central Mexico, and is often sold dried there. The flesh is white, soft in mature specimens and does not change colour upon bruising. The <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> is pleasant. People of La Malinche have likened the flavour to pork and pork crackling. It is easily misidentified as the porcini Boletus edulis, due to the similar habitat and appearance.|$|E
5|$|Most fish possess highly {{developed}} sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color vision {{that is at}} least as good as a human's (see vision in fishes). Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>smell.</b> Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the Ampullae of Lorenzini, organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt. Other fish, like the South American electric fishes Gymnotiformes, can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts possess highly {{developed}} sensory organs. Nearly all daylight fish have colour vision {{at least as}} good as a normal human's. Many fish also have chemoreceptors responsible for acute senses of <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>smell.</b> Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Fish sense sounds in a variety of ways, using the lateral line, the swim bladder, and in some species the Weberian apparatus. Fish orient themselves using landmarks, and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Experiments with mazes show that fish possess the spatial memory needed to make such a mental map.|$|E

Pedipalps carry {{a large number of}} such setae sensitive to contact chemicals and air-borne smells, such as female pheromones. Spiders also have in the joints of their limbs slit sensillae that detect forces and vibrations. In web-building spiders, all these mechanical and chemical sensors are more important than the eyes, while the eyes are most important to spiders that hunt actively.|$|E

25|$|Every year, {{more than}} 200,000 {{individuals}} see their physicians concerning chemosensory problems, {{and many more}} taste disturbances are never reported. Due to {{the large number of}} persons affected by taste disorders, basic and clinical research are receiving support at different institutions and chemosensory research centers across the country. These <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> clinics are focusing their research on better understanding the mechanisms involved in gustatory function and taste disorders such as dysgeusia. For example, the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders is looking into the mechanisms underlying the key receptors on taste cells and applying this knowledge to the future of medications and artificial food products. Meanwhile, the <b>Taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>Smell</b> Clinic at the University of Connecticut Health Center is integrating behavioral, neurophysiological, and genetic studies involving stimulus concentrations and intensities in order to better understand taste function. The purpose of these studies is to unearth the biological mechanisms underlying taste and to use this data to eliminate taste disorders in order {{to improve the lives of}} taste disorder sufferers.|$|E
25|$|Chemical senses {{include the}} use of chemoreceptors, related to <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>smell,</b> {{affecting}} mating, habitat selection, feeding and parasite-host relationships. Taste is usually located on the mouthparts of the insect but in some insects, such as bees, wasps and ants, taste organs can also be found on the antennae. Taste organs can also be found on the tarsi of moths, butterflies and flies. Olfactory sensilla enable insects to smell and are usually found in the antennae. Chemoreceptor sensitivity related to smell in some substances, is very high and some insects can detect particular odours that are at low concentrations miles from their original source.|$|E

25|$|In most cases, {{the first}} symptom of {{narcolepsy}} to appear is excessive and overwhelming daytime sleepiness. The other symptoms may begin {{alone or in}} combination months or years after {{the onset of the}} daytime naps. There are wide variations in the development, severity, and order of appearance of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations in individuals. Only about 20 to 25 percent of people with narcolepsy experience all four symptoms. The excessive daytime sleepiness generally persists throughout life, but sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations may not. A rare subset of narcoleptics also experience a heightened sense of <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> known as the supertaster phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition {{and being}} {{underweight}} {{are more common}} in the elderly than in adults of other ages. If elderly people are healthy and active, the aging process alone does not usually cause malnutrition. However, changes in body composition, organ functions, adequate energy intake and ability to eat or access food are associated with aging, and may contribute to malnutrition. Sadness or depression can play a role, causing changes in appetite, digestion, energy level, weight, and well-being. A study on the relationship between malnutrition and other conditions in the elderly found that malnutrition in the elderly can result from gastrointestinal and endocrine system disorders, loss of <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>smell,</b> decreased appetite and inadequate dietary intake. Poor dental health, ill-fitting dentures, or chewing and swallowing problems can make eating difficult. As a result of these factors, malnutrition is seen to develop more easily in the elderly.|$|E
25|$|Water quality. In 2015 WASREB {{reported}} that 23 utilities provided good quality water (defined {{as more than}} 95% compliance with standards), 15 acceptable quality and for 53 utilities water quality was not acceptable (defined as less than 90% compliance). The two parameters measured were residual chlorine (40% weight) and compliance with bacteriological standards (60% weight). If the number of samples taken was lower than foreseen in the standard, the compliance was rated lower. The highest compliance was achieved in Kericho and Kisumu with 100% each. A citizens' report carried out in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu in 2007 provided information about customers' perception of water quality: around 70% of households using water from connections to the mains said they found the <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> of water acceptable, and that the water was clear. Even so, {{the vast majority of}} respondents treat water prior to consumption, which shows continuing uncertainty about its quality.|$|E
