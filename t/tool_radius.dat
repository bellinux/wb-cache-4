The surface of the DHOL was an aspherical (refractive) substrate superimposed on a diffractive sub-structure, and by using ultra-precision single point diamond turning, the form error was reduced {{to be less than}} lambda/ 4. However, because of the finite dimensions of the <b>tool</b> <b>radius</b> (R), the pitch of the diffractive structure must be larger than R. This limits the performance of the DHOL and has a bigger effect on the diffractive performance than on the refractive performance. To counteract the limitation, a novel refractive compensation method is proposed. Through superimposing a small refractive curvature, a significant improvement in the diffractive performance was achieved.

40|$|Micro-end-milling {{requires}} high spindle {{rotational speed}} to achieve effective material removal. This results in the requirement of tool stoppage or slowdown during a micro-end-milling operation, a deterrent to productivity and to part acceptability. A circular tool path geometry can avoid discontinuities in the tool movements leading to a more consistent and smooth material removal. However, optimal process planning for such a tool path will require detailed understanding of the chip-formation mechanism in circular end-milling. The cut geometry during end-milling along a circular tool path is often approximated {{as that of a}} linear tool path. Although this assumption works well for circular tool paths with higher <b>tool</b> path <b>radius,</b> {{this is not the case}} for lower <b>tool</b> path <b>radius</b> often used in micro-milling. In this study, the effect of circular tool path on the cutting force for varying tool path rotation angle, <b>tool</b> path <b>radius,</b> and feed rate is experimentally investigated. Systematic signal processing was applied to analyse the measured cutting force signal along linear and several circular tool paths. Qualitative as well as quantitative differences were observed in the cutting force profiles obtained using different <b>tool</b> path <b>radii,</b> <b>tool</b> path orientations, and feed rates.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new three {{dimensional}} cutting process model. The basic features and improvements over previously developed models include: (1) Cutting force calculations {{based on the}} concept of equivalent orthogonal cutting process (EOC), which converts the modelling of three dimensional cutting processes into the modelling or orthogonal cutting processes. In the model, both cutting force coefficient and chip load are considered as the functions of cutting conditions, tool geometry, and machine-tool structural vibrations. (2) Microstructure hardness variation of workpiece material has been taken into consideration. (3) The regenerative mechanism and mode coupling effect in machining are included. The structural dynamics equations, which include five vibration modes, are {{in the form of a}} set of simultaneous differential equations. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is applied to solve these equations numerically. Based on the proposed model, systematic simulation of turning processes has been conducted. The simulation results show that feed and <b>tool</b> nose <b>radius</b> are the primary cutting parameters in determining surface finish. Surface finish improves with the decrease of feed. The effect of <b>tool</b> nose <b>radius</b> is not monotonic: surface finish improves with the increase of <b>tool</b> nose <b>radius</b> when the <b>tool</b> nose <b>radius</b> is below a certain limit. However, above that limit, surface finish becomes worse with the further increase of <b>tool</b> nose <b>radius.</b> Cutting speed, depth of cut and tool geometrical angles are secondary parameters in determining surface finish, and have much smaller influences. The simulation results of surface finish are verified experimentally. The simulated surface finish are in agreement with the experimental results.
