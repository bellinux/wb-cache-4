5|$|On {{the train}} Sameer meets Suraj Prakash (Satish Shah), who makes him <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a thief by asking {{him where he}} keeps {{important}} things (like money) in his luggage. Sameer stays awake all night to avoid being robbed, while Suraj sleeps after conning Sameer into guarding his luggage. Suraj admits this to Sameer {{the next morning at}} the station. Sameer learns that Suraj is a security guard at his resort, and puts him on night guard duty for three months. This puts a crimp in Suraj's marriage and, although he apologises, Sameer is adamant.|$|E
25|$|The Hungarian {{plan of the}} Spring Campaign, {{elaborated}} by Antal Vetter, {{was that}} the 7th corps, under the lead of András Gáspár, had {{to attract the attention}} of Windisch-Grätz on his troops by making and attack from the direction of Hatvan, while the other three corps (I., II., III.) would encircle the Austrian forces from South West, and cut them from the capital cities (Pest and Buda). According to the plan, the 7th corps had to stay at Hatvan until 5 April, than on 6th it had to reach Bag. The attack on the Austrian forces had to occur on 7 April at Gödöllő, from two directions, while the I. corps would advance to Kerepes, and fell on the Austrians from behind, preventing them to retreat towards Pest. The key of this very risky plan was that the Austrians would not discover the Hungarian movements until they completed the encirclement. This is why on the shoulder of the Hungarian commander of the VIIth Corps, András Gáspár, lied a very big responsibility to lead his troops in a way which will not betray the campaigns strategy. This meant that he had to make the enemy commander who faced him, to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> face to face with the whole Hungarian army, distracting his attention about the I., II., and III. Hungarian corps, which in the meanwhile, were advancing towards Gödöllő from South-East. If Gáspár would have failed this task, Windsich-Grätz could been sent huge troops to destroy him, which would have been open before them the way to the interim Hungarian capital, Debrecen.|$|E
500|$|Many fans on the {{internet}} were hoping that the episode would reveal whether or not Mulder is Jewish. In the episode, however, Mulder is unable to identify a Jewish book, states {{that he does not}} know Hebrew, and quips that Jesus returned from the dead. When asked whether or not Mulder is Jewish, Gordon said that he did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> nor did he think he is [...] "even half-Jewish". He did, however, note that [...] "there's something about David [...] that could be Jewish or that has a Jewish sensibility." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to a reviewer's criticism of Bond as villainous, Fleming said in a 1964 Playboy interview {{that he did not}} consider his character to be particularly evil or good: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> necessarily a good guy or a bad guy. Who is? He's got his vices and very few perceptible virtues except patriotism and courage, which are probably not virtues anyway... But I didn't intend for him to be a particularly likeable person." [...] Fleming agreed with some critics' characterisation of Bond as an unthinking killer, but expressed that he was a product of his time: [...] "James Bond is a healthy, violent, noncerebral man in his middle-thirties, and a creature of his era. I wouldn't say he's particularly typical of our times, but he's certainly of the times." ...|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} October 2016, Vaz was {{appointed}} to the Justice Select Committee, after he had put himself forward and was nominated by his party. A House of Commons motion to block this development was defeated; they are rare on such an issue. According to Laura Hughes of The Daily Telegraph, Conservative Party whips told their MPs to vote for Vaz in the division to prevent a precedent being created of such appointments being rejected by MPs. Over 150 Conservative MPs voted in support of Vaz. The Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen asked in the chamber of Vaz: [...] "what makes him <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a fit and proper person this month?" [...] The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Hudson has previously announced an investigation into Vaz's conduct.|$|E
2500|$|He {{is survived}} by his wife, Donna Wilson Scott, their twin sons, and his brother, film {{director}} Ridley Scott. Many actors paid tribute to him, including Tom Cruise, Christian Slater, Val Kilmer, Eddie Murphy, Denzel Washington, Gene Hackman, Elijah Wood, Dane Cook, Dwayne Johnson, Stephen Fry, Peter Fonda and Keira Knightley, as well as musical collaborators Hybrid. Cruise stated, [...] "He was a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable." [...] Denzel Washington, Scott's most frequent acting collaborator, said, [...] "Tony Scott was a great director, a genuine friend and it is unfathomable to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> now gone." [...] Directors UK chairman Charles Sturridge commented, [...] "Tony Scott was a brilliant British director with an extraordinary ability to create energy on screen, both in action and in the creation of character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{have accused}} Slaughterhouse-Five {{of being a}} quietist work, because Billy Pilgrim {{believes}} {{that the notion of}} free will is a quaint Earthling illusion. The problem, according to Robert Merrill and Peter A. Scholl, is that [...] "Vonnegut's critics seem to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> saying the same thing [...] For Anthony Burgess, [...] "Slaughterhouse is a kind of evasion—in a sense, like J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan—in which we’re being told to carry the horror of the Dresden bombing, and everything it implies, up to a level of fantasy..." [...] For Charles Harris, [...] "The main idea emerging from Slaughterhouse-Five seems to be that the proper response to life is one of resigned acceptance." [...] For Alfred Kazin, [...] "Vonnegut deprecates any attempt to see tragedy, that day, in Dresden... He likes to say, with arch fatalism, citing one horror after another, 'So it goes.'" [...] For Tanner, [...] "Vonnegut has... total sympathy with such quietistic impulses." [...] The same notion is found throughout The Vonnegut Statement, a book of original essays written and collected by Vonnegut’s most loyal academic fans.|$|E
