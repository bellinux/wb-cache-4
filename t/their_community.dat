40|$|A renewed {{call from}} {{national}} and state governments to strengthen connections between public schools and <b>their</b> <b>communities</b> invites people outside {{of the school system}} to play {{an active role in the}} decision-making process. Despite recent efforts to connect public schools and <b>their</b> <b>communities,</b> the two parties remain disconnected. This paper reflects on the historical literature on the development of public education from the 19 th century to the present to understand the roots of this persistent disconnection. The first section establishes the initial connections between the public schools and <b>their</b> <b>communities.</b> These initial consensual connections, justified by public school crusaders, were fueled and supported by both public school representatives and <b>their</b> <b>communities.</b> The second section shows that the last two centuries witnessed the fracturing of the religious, political, and economic arguments for connection.

5|$|A delegation, {{consisting}} of {{the representatives of the}} twelve important clans of Medina, invited Muhammad to serve as chief arbitrator for the entire community; due to his status as a neutral outsider. There was fighting in Yathrib: primarily the dispute involved its Arab and Jewish inhabitants, and was estimated to have lasted for around a hundred years before 620. The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the Battle of Bu'ath in which all clans were involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal concept of blood-feud and {{an eye for an eye}} were no longer workable unless there was one man with authority to adjudicate in disputed cases.

5|$|In a loose, {{unstructured}} modernist narrative {{style that}} draws from Christian allegory and oral storytelling, Faulkner explores themes of race, sex, class and {{religion in the}} American South. By focusing on characters that are misfits, outcasts, or are otherwise marginalized in <b>their</b> <b>community,</b> he portrays the clash of alienated individuals against a Puritanical, prejudiced rural society. Early reception of the novel was mixed, with some reviewers critical of Faulkner's style and subject matter. However, over time, the novel {{has come to be}} {{considered one of the most}} important literary works by Faulkner and one of the best English-language novels of the 20th century.|$|E
