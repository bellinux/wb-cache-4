5|$|So I {{went out}} and saw the band – Billy, James, and D'arcy – playing at Avalon with a drum machine. Man, did they sound horrible! They were atrocious. But the <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> was that {{not only were the}} song {{structures}} good, but Billy's voice had a lot of drive to it, like he was dying to succeed. So I ended up driving from work every Wednesday to rehearse with them.|$|E
500|$|After {{deciding}} {{upon the}} idea to use a genie, Gilligan approached Carter for feedback. Carter {{was impressed with the}} story, saying, [...] "Vince had been playing around with somebody finding something in a storage locker. He played around with several different ideas and one day he came in with one idea of a genie and three wishes. The one <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> right away was that the relationship between Mulder and the genie was very sweet." [...] After finalizing his script, Gilligan began to worry that he had [...] "painted himself in a corner": [...] "I did not intend to write a hard episode to direct [...] But before I realize it, I was blowing up a trailer, having a truck hit an invisible man, and all sorts of genie effects. [...] I looked at all the people on the set [...] and thought, 'Oh man, I'm going to be exposed as an impostor.'" [...] Luckily, the cast and crew helped the new director ease into his position. In addition, many of the members of production noted that the work environment under Gilligan was largely stress-free.|$|E
2500|$|Upon release, Record Mirror {{reviewed}} the album and concluded: [...] "The numbers offer {{a lot of}} variety. The most immediate <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> was the arrangements - which included some solid bass work that would have done justice to Led Zeppelin. Next, there's the use of backup vocals, something Slade haven't used {{too much in the}} past. Finally, there's the pace, lots of it. It's not an album of singles - it does present tracks that are a lot deeper than I expected. You're right lads, you're nobody's fools!" [...] New Musical Express wrote: [...] "Well if this album is an accurate representation of their album-making ability I doubt it very much. Oh, Slade are an exciting band. Plenty of kick and grit, and their unrefined charm which has been captured from their live performances in the studio environment, but though superficially the music here is of reasonable standard, there's not a lot of depth. Really the album is just a collection of hooky little singles." [...] Music Week wrote [...] "A cracking album, the group is now playing better than ever. Slade has matured {{to the point of being}} able to convert an older audience to their cause." ...|$|E

60|$|You needn't a swer this; I am only {{practicing}} to get three; another slip-up there; only practici?ng to get {{the hang}} of the <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>I</b> miss fire & get in a good many unnecessary letters and punctuation marks.

50|$|The title song is a Swedish {{version of}} a poem by Norwegian Inger Hagerup, while Jag Ger Dig Min Morgon (English: I give you the morning) is a {{translation}} of a song by Tom Paxton from the 1969 LP The <b>Things</b> <b>I</b> <b>Notice</b> Now.|$|R
2500|$|Matt Leone of 1UP.com said of a pre-release {{version of}} the game's PS3 port at E3 2009: [...] "The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> was that, {{at the end of}} a normal combo, you can hold down the final button in the string to {{continuously}} fire gunshots—which looks incredibly cool when you kick someone and then keep your leg pointed at their face as your foot pours bullets on it." [...] He added, [...] "I'll be amazed if Bayonetta doesn't end up being one of the best action games this year." [...] Staff at GameSpot UK were also generally impressed with the PS3 port, which they played on June 3. [...] They called the [...] "Witch Time" [...] mechanic a [...] "cool move" [...] and one of the two boss battles they fought were [...] "pretty intense", and said [...] "it's easy to see the similarities between the two over-the-top action games [...] ". [...] They added, [...] "Rampant violence and sexism is par for the course" [...] in the game. [...] 1UP's staff again played a PS3 version for 15 minutes on the weekend of August 31 that year, at PlatinumGames's [...] "Feel Bayonetta" [...] event in Tokyo's Roppongi district. [...] They said that it [...] "was very blurry" [...] compared to a 360 version displayed there, and that its frame rate [...] "was all over the place.... it was often hard to keep track of the action [...] because of the graphical issues on PS3." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> about Ostend," [...] he remarked, [...] "they {{charge you}} a frightful price for everything. We {{never got a}} glass of {{champagne}} there like this." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{drew near}} and looked {{carefully}} at the place. The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> was that the rock, which was not quite perpendicular, had been worn by the continual passage of baboons; the second, that something white was hanging on a bush {{near the top of}} the ascent.|$|E
60|$|As I {{read over}} what I have written <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> how the {{terminology}} {{of the sea}} has stolen into my mental processes. Involuntarily I {{think in terms of}} the sea. Another <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> is my excessive use of superlatives. But then, everything on board the Elsinore is superlative. I find myself continually combing my vocabulary in quest of just and adequate words. Yet am I aware of failure. For example, all the words of all the dictionaries would fail to approximate the exceeding terribleness of Mulligan Jacobs.|$|R
60|$|LIZA. I'm no preacher: <b>I</b> don't <b>notice</b> <b>things</b> like that. <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> {{that you}} don't notice me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "for {{the last}} week I have been {{trailing}} you, and as I {{did not know how}} long I might be coming up with you, I have plenty of provisions. Yours, it is evident from one or two <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed,</b> are running out, and you can't get through the sterile belt without a supply. It was rather a pity the San Roque people burned the village where you expected to get some. I'm open to hand you over all the loads I can spare in return for the girl Anita." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look!" [...] she said, stooping low, {{and laying}} her slim left hand, palm downwards, across my table. I did look; {{and the first}} <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> was how like herself that hand was, and how much less {{vigorous}} and formidable than Fanny's. And then I caught her meaning.|$|E
60|$|The next <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> {{was that}} a great {{mellowness}} had descended upon {{the mother of the}} last of his race. But these terms, irritation, mellowness, appeared gross when applied to her. It is impossible to give an idea of the refinement and subtlety of all her transformations. She smiled faintly at me.|$|E
6000|$|An {{insignificant}} thing {{made him}} burst out. Tommy La Croix, the French Canuck, a quick, grinning, evil-spoken, tobacco-chewing, rather likeable young thug, stared directly at Carl and said, loudly: [...] "'Nother <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> was that Frazer didn't have his pants pressed. Funny, ain't it, that when even these dudes from Yale {{get to be}} cranks they're short on baths and tailors?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To get {{yourself}} in trouble {{is a very}} easy <b>thing.</b> [...] <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> that to others it will always worries bring. [...] But getting out of trouble's always quite the other way-- [...] The more you try to wriggle out, the longer you must stay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The house detective. It's my {{business}} to watch <b>things.</b> So <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> {{you talking to}} the police officer; <b>I</b> also <b>noticed</b> the patrol wagon standing {{on the opposite side}} of the street for nearly an hour--my report on that will amuse them at headquarters, won't it? And <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> you nod to the bruiser, just as your victim came out." ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{the blue}} paper--a <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> had never <b>noticed</b> before--I saw {{stand out in}} white letters the word and figures: [...] "Malvern, 1898." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{went into}} the house by a side door, the great front {{entrance}} had two chains across it outside,--and the first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> was, that the passages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there. She took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase, and still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.|$|E
60|$|One other <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed,</b> {{which was}} an {{agreeable}} disappointment to me. I {{had been told that}} there was no social intercourse between the established church and dissenters. In this party, however, were people of many different denominations. Our host belongs to the established church; his brother, with whom we are visiting, is a Baptist, and their father was a Friend; and there appeared to be the utmost social cordiality. Whether I shall find this uniformly the case will appear in time.|$|E
6000|$|One <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> {{which he}} did not. When we were winding along the narrow path, bearing no more {{proportion}} to the dizzy heights above and below than the smallest insect creeping on the wall, I looked across the chasm, and saw a row of shepherds' cottages perched midway on a narrow shelf, that seemed in the distance not an inch wide. By a very natural impulse, I exclaimed, [...] "What does become of the little children there? I should think they would all fall over the precipice!" ...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the first}} <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> while {{interviewing}} Dr. Ron Myers as the 1989 recipient of Norden Distinguished Teacher Award was an identical commendation on the wall from 1984. The frequency with which an instructor may receive the Norden Award is every five years; Ron Myers received his second one as they say, ASAP. When the award was presented last spring the entire student body gave him a standing ovation. That says something about his consistent dedication, enthusiasm and excellence. Indicative of this deep concern for veterinary education, he is, among other things, chairman of the curriculum committee {{and chairman of the}} Teacher Learner Alliance...|$|R
60|$|Iffley Lock and Mill, a mile {{before you}} reach Oxford, is a {{favourite}} subject with the river-loving brethren of the brush. The real article, however, is rather disappointing, after the pictures. Few <b>things,</b> <b>I</b> have <b>noticed,</b> come quite {{up to the}} pictures of them, in this world.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's just right. The strange <b>thing</b> is, <b>I</b> hadn't <b>noticed</b> this before; <b>I</b> don't think--Jefferson bothered {{about his}} office. Anyhow {{the room was}} his." ...|$|R
60|$|We took a final {{sweep of}} the {{wonderful}} view of plain and city and ocean, and so ended our visit to the garden and the Towers of Silence; and the last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> was another symbol--a voluntary symbol this one; it was a vulture standing on the sawed-off top of a tall and slender and branchless palm in an open space in the ground; he was perfectly motionless, and looked {{like a piece of}} sculpture on a pillar. And he had a mortuary look, too, which was in keeping with the place.|$|E
60|$|I {{opened my}} eyes and looked about me. The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> was that my double-barrelled pistol, which I had placed at full cock beside me before I went to sleep, was gone, also my large clasp-knife. This {{discovery}} did not tend to raise my spirits, since I was now quite weaponless. Then I observed Marût seated {{on the floor of the}} hut staring straight in front of him, and noted that at length even he had ceased to smile, but that his lips were moving as though he were engaged in prayer or meditation.|$|E
60|$|The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> {{about the}} birds--an {{observation}} confirmed later on many waters--was that {{each pair of}} kingfishers have their own particular pools, over which they exercise unquestioned lordship. There may be a dozen pairs of birds on a single stream; but, so far as I {{have been able to}} observe, each family has a certain stretch of water on which no other kingfishers are allowed to fish. They may pass up and down freely, but they never stop at the minnow pools; they are caught watching near them, they are promptly driven out by the rightful owners.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, no, I am only {{conscious}} of two sorts noisy and quiet ones. I prefer the latter, but, {{as a general}} <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>notice</b> any of them much more than I do flies, unless they bother me, then I'd like to flap them away, but as that won't do, I hide." ...|$|R
6000|$|Behind this {{staggering}} {{group of}} two I believe Mrs. Bunting came. Then Mr. Bunting. Dreadfully wet and broken down Mr. Bunting {{must have been}} by then, and from one or two <b>things</b> <b>I</b> have <b>noticed</b> since, <b>I</b> can't help imagining him as pursuing his wife with, [...] "Of course, my dear, I couldn't tell, you know!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "When {{opposition}} forces began their operation to liberate Tripoli {{a few days}} ago," [...] he wrote in August 2011, [...] "one of the first <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed,</b> speaking to my family in the capital, was {{that for the first}} time they were publicly denouncing Gaddafi, his sons and his regime. Doing that had in itself become an act of liberation....But it wasn't only personal fear that began to dissipate inside us during the last six months. We began also actively reclaiming a nation that had been hijacked for more than four decades....In just six months, a generation of young Libyans has begun to learn what it might mean to enjoy a life not ruled by the oppressive terror of falling foul of the rulers. Once they tasted this forbidden fruit, there was no going back." ...|$|R
60|$|One more <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> about Kari, namely, that he shrank {{from women}} and indeed seemed to hate them. The maids who had {{remained}} with me since my uncle's death noticed this, by nature as it were, and in revenge would not serve him. The {{end of it}} was that, fearing lest they should do him some evil turn with the priests or otherwise, I sent them away and hired men to take their place. This distaste of Kari for women I set down to all that he had suffered {{at the hands of}} his false and beautiful wife not wrongly as I think.|$|E
6000|$|When supper {{was over}} we all adjourned {{to the room}} which Mr. Trelawny had set aside as his study, his bedroom being close to it. As we entered, the first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> was a great safe, {{somewhat}} similar to that which stood in his room in London. When {{we were in the}} room Mr. Trelawny went over to the table, and, taking out his pocket-book, laid it on the table. As he did so he pressed down on it with the palm of his hand. A strange pallor came over his face. With fingers that trembled he opened the book, saying as he did so: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} about the transfer, Mr. Hartington, because, when the crash came, everything connected with it was talked over. In point of fact, {{we did not}} see Mr. Hartington's signature actually attached. He called at the office one day, and just after he had left Mr. Brander called us in and said, 'Please witness Mr. Hartington's signature.' Of course, we both knew it very well and witnessed it. I did not notice {{the names on the}} body of the transfer, though, of course, I knew from the appearance of the document what it was, but Mr. Brander just pointed out where we were to sign and we signed. The only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> was that as I wrote my eye fell on the top line, and I saw that it was dated ten days earlier." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{preceding}} {{pages were}} written before I became {{acquainted with the}} contents of the May number of the [...] "Nineteenth Century," [...] wherein <b>I</b> discover many <b>things</b> which are decidedly not to my advantage. It would appear that [...] "evasion" [...] is my chief resource, [...] "incapacity for strict argument" [...] and [...] "rottenness of ratiocination" [...] my main mental characteristics, and that it is [...] "barely credible" [...] that a statement which I profess to make of my own knowledge is true. All which <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice,</b> merely to illustrate the great truth, forced on me by long experience, that it is only from those who enjoy the blessing of a firm hold of the Christian faith that such manifestations of meekness, patience, and charity are to be expected.|$|R
60|$|But {{it was a}} {{different}} Boy Jim from him whom I had known and loved. There was a change in him somewhere, a change so marked that it was the first <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>noticed,</b> and yet so subtle that I could not put words to it. He was not better dressed than of old, for I well knew the old brown suit that he wore.|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} after the episode aired, Sapochnik detailed {{the process of}} filming the battle and called Akira Kurosawa's Ran an inspiration in shooting the scenes: [...] "I watched every pitch field battle I could find (footage of real ones too), looking for patterns — for what works, what doesn't, what takes {{you out of the}} moment, what keeps you locked in. Interestingly one of the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> is that staging of these battles through the years has changed dramatically. Back in the day you'd see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication. And second, often when the horses would go down, you can kind of tell they got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never get away with that, and nor would you want to." ...|$|R
