The son is greatly influenced by his father who is a prominent pianist, and he eventually follows the identical path as his father. Upon watching his father confront Alzheimers, he becomes more worried about his life and his family. In the end, the son becomes hopeful when his father keeps asking what song he can hear while his father's recorded version of Fur Elise is being played, and the son realizes that he can hear his father's breathing within his music. Counting Pulses: it is a story about the son and his mother. The son is always conscious about taking care of his sick mother who needs his care even when she is in need of taking medicine.

40|$|The Polar Night Jet (PNJ) is {{a strong}} stratospheric {{westerly}} circumpolar wind at around 65 ° N in winter, {{and the strength of}} the climatological PNJ is widely recognized to increase monotonically from October through late December. Remarkably, the climatological PNJ temporarily stops increasing during late November. We examined <b>this</b> <b>short</b> <b>break</b> in terms of the atmospheric dynamical balance and found that it results from an increase in the upward propagation of climatological planetary waves from the troposphere to the stratosphere in late November, which coincides with a maximum of the climatological Eliassen–Palm flux convergence in the lower stratosphere. The upward propagation of planetary waves at 100  hPa, which is strongest over Siberia, is related to the climatological strengthening of the tropospheric trough over Siberia. We suggest that longitudinally asymmetric forcing by land–sea heating contrasts caused by their different heat capacities can account for the strengthening of the trough...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a PhD study which explored {{the impact of}} <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> provided by children’s hospices on the partner relationship between parents. The specific objectives {{of the study were}} to: (1) explore parents’ perceptions of parenting life-limited/ threatened children or young people on their relationships, (2) determine if frequent <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> enhance relationship satisfaction between parental figures compared to those who receive <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> less frequently or not at all, (3) identify effects on relationships of parents receiving home and hospice-based <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> compared to those receiving hospice-based <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> only or home-based care only, and (4) identify societal factors influencing romantic relationships between parents of families receiving <b>short</b> <b>breaks.</b> A two phase exploratory sequential mixed methods design was used. In the first phase fifteen parental figures accessing a children’s hospice were interviewed. Three main themes were identified, reflecting parents’ perceptions of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> on their relationship with their partners: (1) ‘Every family is different’, (2) ‘Short break significance’ and (3) ‘Short break quality’. The theme ‘Every family is different’ encompassed three sub-themes: (i) ‘Alternative short breaks’; (ii) ‘Pressure and conflict between parental figures’ and (iii) ‘Together but separate’. ‘Short break significance’ comprised (i) ‘Significance to relationship’ and (ii) ‘Children before relationship’. ‘Short break quality’ encompassed: (i) ‘Building trust’ and (ii) ‘Getting a real break’. The second phase, an online survey, further explored interview themes. Participating children’s hospices distributed the survey to parents currently accessing <b>short</b> <b>breaks.</b> Results suggested hospice <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> positively impacted relationship satisfaction and also supported interview themes. Integration of findings from both phases revealed the impact of children’s hospice <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> on parental relationships is mediated by both external and internal influences. External influences are represented by a modified ABCX model of adjustment and adaptation (McCubbin and Patterson 1983) and the theme ‘Every family is different’. Families differ externally in terms of contributory stressors and protective resources. Couples with high contributing stressors and low protective resources benefit from <b>short</b> <b>breaks,</b> whilst those with low contributing factors and high protective resources benefit less. The theme of ‘Short break quality’ represented internal influences, comprising ‘Building trust’ and ‘Getting a real break’. Building trust was strongly linked to frequency of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> and hospice staff knowing the child or young person. The theme ‘Getting a real break’ was linked to <b>short</b> <b>break</b> location. If <b>short</b> <b>break</b> quality was perceived to be poor, perceived impact on relationships between parents was lessened. This study has significant implications for how <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> are delivered by children’s hospices, specifically the importance of recognising individual family differences, tailoring <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> to meet these differing needs and building trust between parents and hospice staff...|$|R

The next theme looks at the physical location of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> and how access issues and the suitability of the location and venue can affect their beneficial impact. The ways in which information and communication affect access to and experience of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> is considered in the third theme. What families and disabled children want from the people who provide the <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> forms the focus of the fourth theme.

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} identifies {{positive and}} negative effects of being a sibling in a family which includes a disabled child. <b>Short</b> <b>break</b> services (also known as respite) provide families with a break from caring and offer disabled children the chance to participate in various activities. This paper investigates the effects that these <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> have on siblings. Methods: The research consists of a qualitative analysis of data collected {{as part of a}} survey of families using <b>short</b> <b>break</b> services. Data from 239 parent-carers (mostly biological parents) and 84 siblings are included in the analysis. Data are written responses to open questions about use of services and the effects they have. Results: The effects of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> on siblings are described as being mostly positive. <b>Short</b> <b>breaks</b> have the potential to ameliorate some of the negative impacts of being a sibling in a family with a disabled child whilst also promoting the positive impacts of having a disabled brother or sister. However, some siblings also report some adverse effects of <b>short</b> <b>breaks.</b> Conclusion: <b>Short</b> <b>breaks</b> have a significant role to play in promoting the wellbeing of siblings; however, their role currently seems to be largely unrecognised and consequently undervalued...|$|R
40|$|There are {{widespread}} {{assumptions about}} the potential impacts of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> on family carers and disabled children. This review aims to evaluate the existing international research evidence concerning the impacts of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> on families with a disabled child. Electronic literature searches were conducted using ASSIA, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Web of Science, and requests for information were sent to selected email lists. Of 60 articles or reports identified {{for inclusion in the}} review, the vast majority of studies were cross-sectional, with only eight studies using quasi-experimental pre-post designs or longitudinal designs. Nonetheless, the consistency with which some findings have been reported suggests that <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> appear to have the potential to positively impact on not only the well-being of carers, but also the children receiving <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> and their families as a whole. Additional research is warranted in a number of areas. First, research needs to consider the impact of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> on fathers. Second, {{there is a need to}} consider in more depth how <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> can impact on the siblings of disabled children. Third, research could consider how best <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> can be combined with other interventions to maximise the impact for disabled children and their families. Fourth, research needs to look at the longer term impact of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> on outcomes for disabled children and their families. What is needed is evidence on what type of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> are best for children and families with particular characteristics at particular times during the course of the child's maturation towards adulthood...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} investigates the {{benefits}} of a good night’s sleep and <b>short</b> work <b>breaks</b> for employees’ daily work engagement. It is hypothesized that sleep and self-initiated <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> help restore energetic and self-regulatory resources which, in turn, enable employees to experience high work engagement. A daily diary study was conducted with 107 employees who provided data twice a day (before lunch {{and at the end of}} the working day) over 5 workdays (453 days in total). Multilevel regression analyses showed that sleep quality and <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> were beneficial for employees’ daily work engagement. After nights employees slept better, they indicated higher work engagement during the day. Moreover, taking self-initiated <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> from work in the afternoon boosted daily work engagement, whereas taking <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> in the morning failed to predict daily work engagement. Taking <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> did not compensate for impaired sleep with regard to daily work engagement. Overall, these findings suggest that recovery before and during work can foster employees’ daily work engagement. Article free to read on journal websit...|$|R
40|$|Australian <b>short</b> <b>break</b> {{holidays}} {{have received}} scant {{attention in the}} tourism literature, even though this type of holiday has emerged internationally as a significant travel trend in recent years.

This stage examines some of the characteristics of self-drive <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> such as importance, frequency, travelling time, preferred destinations, and destination attractiveness attributes. The paper concludes that <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> represent a significant aspect of holiday behaviour for the sample, drawn from a Brisbane population that is literally spoilt for choice of available destinations within south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales. A feature of the paper is a cross-country comparison of key results with a similar study undertaken in New Zealand, which reveals strong similarities in attitudes towards <b>short</b> <b>breaks.</b> It is suggested therefore the research has implications not only for destinations close to Brisbane, but also for those in other areas...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between day trips, <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> (2 - 4 days), and holidays (5 + days) {{has never been}} examined {{at the level of}} the individual consumer because surveys on day and overnight trips are typically conducted independently. In this article, both the stated and the inferred {{relationship between}} day trips, <b>short</b> <b>breaks,</b> and holidays are explored. The stated relationship between these types of tourist trips is examined by investigating whether or not people consciously trade off ovemight trips against day trips. Li ttle evidence is found to infer that people consider these trips us interchangeable activities, suggesting independence between these tourist activities. The inferred relationship between day trips, <b>short</b> <b>breaks,</b> and holidays is examined by analyzing tourists' activ~ ity programs (the agenda of tourist activities for the next year) and by analyzing tourists' actual behavior. Activity programs are examined by means of rank and partial correlation analysis between the day trip, the <b>short</b> <b>break,</b> and the holiday segments of activity programs for a l-year period. Actual behavior is examined by means of cluster analysis, grouping together respondents with similar frequencies for holidays, <b>short</b> <b>breaks,</b> and day trips. Both the correlation and the cluster analysis suggest that holidays and day trips are substitutes. Holidays and short beaks, on the other hand, appear to be complements, whereas day trips and <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> appear to be independent activities...|$|R

40|$|A clear policy trend exists towards {{promoting}} {{the use of}} direct payments (DPs), including those for families with disabled children who use <b>short</b> <b>breaks.</b> However, uptake has been slow and use of DPs has been socially patterned. Recent programmes in England have dramatically increased investment in <b>short</b> <b>break</b> provision including breaks funded through DPs. This research examines the characteristics, circumstances and experiences of families who use DPs to fund <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> with those who use <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> funded in other ways. The paper draws on surveys totalling 348 parents and carers in families with disabled children using <b>short</b> <b>breaks.</b> We investigate associations {{between the use of}} DPs and a range of demographic, socio-economic, well-being, service use and satisfaction indicators. Logistic regression identifies which variables are most strongly associated with use of DPs. We also draw on open-ended survey responses which highlight important aspects of families' experience of using DPs. Characteristics significantly associated with increased use of DPs include the presence of main carers who are female, more highly educated and from White British backgrounds, younger children, lower levels of area deprivation, greater access to service and social networks and use of more hours of <b>short</b> <b>breaks.</b> Characteristics not found to be significantly associated with use of DPs include various health and well-being indicators, impairment characteristics of children and service satisfaction. A range of benefits of DPs are described along with problems accessing and using them. Direct payments can have a number of benefits for families using <b>short</b> <b>breaks,</b> but access to them is currently problematic and socially patterned. If the uptake of DPs is to be increased and made more equitable, more attention must be paid to promoting and supporting their use in ways which meet the needs of individual families...|$|R
