5|$|At 10:20, Wickson, the F-15C flight lead, {{reported}} entering northern Iraq to the AWACS controller {{responsible for}} air traffic inside the TAOR, USAF Lieutenant Ricky Wilson. The TAOR frequency that the F-15s were using {{was different from}} the en-route frequency being used by the two Black Hawks. Wilson, however, was monitoring both frequencies and being able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>both</b> Black Hawks on his radar scope before they disappeared at 10:12. Wilson and the other AWACS crew members, many of whom were monitoring the F-15s' radio frequency, did not inform the F-15s that Black Hawks were currently operating in the TAOR. At 10:21, Wilson, believing that the Black Hawks had landed again, asked Wang if he could drop the friendly helicopter symbols from the AWACS's scopes and Wang approved the request. An AWACS crew instructor, Captain Mark Cathy, who was on the mission to assist the AWACS crew and supervise Wilson on this, his first mission into the TAOR, had retired {{to the back of the}} airplane at 10:00 to take a nap.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914 delayed the start of Amundsen's northern polar drift—to which the South Pole expedition had been intended as a preliminary—until July1918. He then set off in a specially-constructed vessel, Maud, which remained in Arctic waters {{for the next seven}} years. The ship did not drift over the North Pole, although {{in the course of the}} expedition it became the second ship to traverse the North-East Passage. Amundsen left the expedition in 1923; the remaining years of his life were largely devoted to polar exploration by air. On 12May 1926, aboard the airship Norge with Lincoln Ellsworth and Umberto Nobile, Amundsen flew over the North Pole. He and Wisting, also on the airship, were the first men <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>both</b> poles. In 1928, while attempting to rescue a later Nobile expedition, Amundsen disappeared with his aircraft in the seas between Norway and Spitsbergen.|$|E

25|$|Innes was {{involved}} in virtually every significant act in Cape political life during {{his years as a}} parliamentarian, and his alliance with Merriman and Sauer was a formidable one.

Hoping to meet someone who might be able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>both</b> viewpoints, Dawkins interviews Yousef al-Khattab, formerly Joseph Cohen, an American-born Jew who came to Israel as a settler before converting to Islam. After offering Dawkins a cheerful welcome, al-Khattab explains his views relating to the decadence of Western values.|$|E

25|$|Guide {{books and}} travel {{accounts}} with {{details of the}} country and people have had a long history - some books from the 19th century and early 20th century being classics with description of places that were perceived as things <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> <b>Both</b> private authors and government publications (such as the 1920s Come to Java books produced in Batavia by the government tourist bureau of the time) have been made each decade through to the present. There were restrictions to tourism during World War II and the mid-to-late 1960s - other than those two periods - travel accounts and guide books have been produced regularly. James Rush's and Adrian Vickers' texts mentioned below are excellent introductions to the range of writing that has been created.|$|E
25|$|Callwell’s 2 volume “Life and Diaries” in 1927 damaged Wilson’s {{reputation}} – the “New Statesman” {{thought they}} showed {{him to be}} “the typically stupid militarist…fundamentally a fool” Sir Charles Deedes, who had studied under him at Staff College and later served on his staff, commented that Wilson came across in the diaries as “an ambitious, volatile and even fatuous character, an intriguer concerned mainly with his own career” {{and that this was}} “far from the truth” – Deedes commented that Wilson’s ability <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>both</b> sides of a question and inability to make a decision and stick to it made him a poor corps commander but a “patient, lucid and fair” adviser. Lloyd George’s view in his own “War Memoirs” was essentially similar, although he wrote that Wilson was reluctant to take responsibility for decisions.|$|E

25|$|In February 1573, the Cimarrons {{informed}} Drake {{that the}} Spanish mule trains carrying the gold (also {{known as the}} flota) were sighted in Nombre de Dios and were moving across the Isthmus. Drake, guided by 30 Cimarrones {{through a series of}} hidden pathways and accompanied by John Oxenham, embarked on a journey to intercept the gold. They rose at dawn and marched until four in the afternoon. Without the help of the Cimarrons, who were clearly in charge of the path finding, Drake and his men would have never made it across the Isthmus. At one point during the journey, the Cimarrons took the English to their favorite point on a steep hill where it was possible <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>both</b> the Atlantic and Pacific oceans at the same time. It is clear that the Cimarrones valued the natural geographic wonders that surrounded them.|$|E
25|$|Yasuna's unique affliction to {{be unable}} to see males is changed from the manga to the anime. While in the manga Yasuna says she has never once {{been able to see}} males {{completely}} clearly (Hazumu being the only slight exception), Yasuna explains in the anime that she at one time was able to see males, but one day she could not see her father anymore after he got angry with her as a child, and it escalated from there to encompass all males. Additionally, in the eleventh anime episode, Yasuna becomes unable to see females as well, though this is later rectified in episode twelve when Yasuna is completely healed and is able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>both</b> males and females. In the anime, Yasuna is shown to be terrified of males, even those in her own class, but in the manga she merely pays very little attention to males around her, even when spoken to directly, or otherwise ignores males completely. In the anime, Yasuna is shown at one time accidentally ignoring her father at the dinner table, but the only time Yasuna is shown speaking to her father in the manga has her smiling to him.|$|E

25|$|On 22 June 1893 the {{flagship}} of the Mediterranean fleet, HMS Victoria, collided with HMS Camperdown, resulting in serious damage to Camperdown, but {{the sinking of}} Victoria {{with the loss of}} 358 lives. Vice-admiral George Tryon, who had ordered the maneuvre which resulted in the collision, was amongst those who drowned. It became necessary to find a replacement as commander of the squadron, and Admiral Sir Michael Culme-Seymour, 3rd Baronet was appointed. Culme-Seymour first acquired as secretary Staff Paymaster Henry Rickard, formerly secretary to Admiral of the fleet Prince Alfred, who had just ceased to be commander in chief of Plymouth. Culme-Seymour next telegraphed to Evan-Thomas, requesting that he would take the post of flag-lieutenant. Evan-Thomas hesitated, because the post was at least on paper less than a lieutenant of his seniority might expect. However, the request was endorsed by Admiral Lord Clanwilliam, and also the first sea lord, Sir Anthony Hoskins. Evan-Thomas went <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>both</b> admirals who assured him he had been chosen on merit, as it was felt that under the circumstances the best man possible was required for the post.|$|E

500|$|Throughout this apogee of avant-garde work, Takemitsu's musical style {{seems to}} have {{undergone}} a series of stylistic changes. Comparison of Green (for orchestra, 1967) and A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden (1977) quickly reveals the seeds of this change. The latter was composed according to a pre-compositional scheme, in which pentatonic modes were superimposed over one central pentatonic scale (the so-called [...] "black-key pentatonic") around a central sustained central pitch (F-sharp), and an approach that is highly indicative {{of the sort of}} [...] "pantonal" [...] and modal pitch material seen gradually emerging in his works throughout the 1970s. The former, Green (or November Steps II) written 10 years earlier, is heavily influenced by Debussy, and is, in spite of its very dissonant language (including momentary quarter-tone clusters), largely constructed through a complex web of modal forms. These modal forms are largely audible, particularly in the momentary repose {{toward the end of the}} work. Thus in these works, it is possible <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>both</b> a continuity of approach, and the emergence of a simpler harmonic language that was to characterise the work of his later period.|$|E
