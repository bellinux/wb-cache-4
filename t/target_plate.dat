40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{experimental}} and numerical investigations of aluminum <b>target</b> <b>plates</b> impacted by blunt, ogive and hemispherical nosed steel projectiles. The projectiles were normally impacted on the <b>target</b> <b>plates</b> of 0. 5, 0. 71, 1, 1. 5, 2, 2. 5 and 3 mm thicknesses at different velocities {{with the help of}} a pneumatic gun. Effect of projectile nose shape, impact velocity and plate thickness on the deformation of the <b>target</b> <b>plates</b> was studied. Hemispherical nosed projectile caused highest global deformation (dishing) of the <b>target</b> <b>plates.</b> Ogive nosed projectiles were found to be the most efficient penetrator for the case of plates of thicknesses 0. 5, 0. 71, 1. 0 and 1. 5 mm. For the case of plates of thicknesses 2. 0, 2. 5 and 3. 0 mm however, blunt nosed projectiles required least energy to perforate the <b>target</b> <b>plates.</b> The ballistic limit velocity of hemispherical nosed projectiles was found to be highest as compared to the other two projectiles. Finite element analysis of the problem was carried out using ABAQUS finite element code.

50|$|Off-line {{coupling}} of CE to MALDI, the CE effluent {{could be}} sprayed or added drop wise on MALDI <b>target</b> <b>plate</b> then dried and analyzed by MS. For online coupling, {{a moving target}} with continuous contact to CE capillary end is required. The moving target takes analytes into MS where it is desorbed and ionized. Musyimi et al. developed a new technique where rotating ball was used to transfer CE to MS. The sample from CE is mixed with matrix coming though another capillary. As the ball rotates the sample is dried before it reaches ionization region. This technique has high sensitivity since no makeup fluid is used.|$|E
50|$|An RCA TK-1 {{test pattern}} {{generator}} (monoscope) is a 19-inch rack-mounted chassis, which contains a monoscope tube housed inside an anti-magnetic steel shield and associated electronic circuits for driving it. The monoscope tube is constructed similarly {{to a small}} cathode ray tube (CRT), but instead of displaying an image, it scans a built-in image, producing a video signal. The tube has a perfectly proportioned copy of the test pattern master art inside, permanently deposited as a carbon image on an aluminum <b>target</b> <b>plate</b> or slide. This perfect copy allowed all of the television studio and production control room video monitors, and home television sets, to be identically adjusted for minimum distortions such as ovals instead of circles. When the monitor or TV set was correctly adjusted to show test pattern circles, the received picture's aspect ratio was exactly four units wide by three units high. The 4 by 3 standard was chosen by the National Television System Committee (NTSC) for analog television, so that film movies would be compatible with TV broadcasting. 4:3 is the same aspect ratio used by 16mm and classic 35mm motion picture film frames.|$|E

These trains were similar in external appearance to the single deck steel suburban cars but were slightly narrower (for 2+2 across seating), built of unpainted stainless steel and corridor connectors between the cars. These trains carried a 'U' <b>target</b> <b>plate,</b> and became affectionately known as 'U Boats'. They featured First and Second Class accommodation until 1974, when they became [...] "one class". First Class (in the ETB trailers) was identifiable by blue covered seats (as opposed to green seats in second class), carpet on the floor and ashtrays in the smoking section. Their operational sphere spread from Lithgow/Bowenfels and Gosford to include Port Kembla, Dapto and Newcastle until their final demise in 1996. They have been used on many railfan tours since the 1960s, sometimes loco-hauled outside the electrified area. Three power cars and two trailer cars have been preserved by the Sydney Electric Train Society. Other U-boat cars have been preserved privately, and many sold to private buyers for a variety of uses after withdrawal.|$|E

40|$|A {{major concern}} for large tokamaks like ITER is the {{presence}} of edge localized modes (ELMs) that repeatedly send large bursts of particles and heat into the divertor plates. Operation with resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP) at the boundary of DIII=D has suppressed ELMs for values of q 95 {approx} 3. 7. At the <b>target</b> <b>plate,</b> the conditions during ELM suppressed operation for both high and low collisionality are observed by a set of radially distributed Langmuir probes. At high collisionality (n*{approx} 1), the <b>target</b> <b>plate</b> particle flux and temperature drops by > 30 % during ELM suppression. At low collisionality (n*{approx} 0. 1), the core density, <b>target</b> <b>plate</b> density, and <b>target</b> <b>plate</b> particle flux drop but the plate electron temperature increases after the ELMs are suppressed.

40|$|Recent new {{results of}} the high Mach flows {{associated}} with plasma detachment are presented {{on the basis of}} numerical simulations and their comparisons with experiments in JT- 60 U divertor plasma. The high Mach flows appear near the ionization front away from the <b>target</b> <b>plate.</b> The plasma static pressure rapidly drops, while the total pressure is kept almost constant along the field line near the ionization front, because the ionization front near the X-point is clearly separated from the momentum loss region near the <b>target</b> <b>plate.</b> Redistribution from static to dynamic pressure without a large momentum loss is confirmed to be a possible mechanism of the high Mach flows.

Good confinement and density is usually associated with Type I ELMs, which, however, will have a severe impact on the divertor <b>target</b> <b>plates</b> in ITER. At the JET-tokamak, impurities have been seeded into a variety of discharge configurations, by which the radiation level can be risen by a factor of 2.

40|$|Formation of an {{electrostatic}} potential due to negatively charged dust particles near a <b>target</b> <b>plate</b> was studied by one-dimensional kinetic analysis. Immovable dust particles are distributed uniformly inside a system. A threshold dust density makes the electric {{field at the}} <b>target</b> <b>plate</b> zero. In case of dust density below the threshold a charge-neutral point separates into two between positions of a plasma injection and a wall. An electron sheath near the injection point changes to an ion sheath {{in front of the}} <b>target</b> <b>plate</b> through the charge-neutral point. It is clarified that the negatively charged dust particles reduce the ion-sheath potential drop from the neutral point. The stationary oscillation appears in the {{electrostatic potential}} for the dust density above the threshold. We confirmed that this oscillation is the Dust Ion-Acoustic Wave (DIAW) with a wavelength of the order of Debye length, where dust charges are effective to determine the behavior. The effective dust density to produce the oscillation is as high as 1013 - 14 m– 3 for plasma density ~ 1018 m– 3 with plasma temperature ~ 10 eV.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the abrasive water jet {{with an emphasis on}} the oblique impact of abrasive particles on the <b>target</b> <b>plate</b> is performed. Ultra-high jet pressure necessitates a close examination of the phenomena featured by small spatial and temporal scales. The effect of oblique impact is assessed from both numerical and practical aspects. Numerical simulation, implemented using the commercial code LS-DYNA, allows a detailed inspection of transient stress wave propagation inside the <b>target</b> <b>plate.</b> And impact experiments facilitate a qualitative description of resultant footprints of oblique water jet. Different incident angles of abrasive particles are adopted and a comparison is thereby unfolded. The results indicate that rebound, embedding, and penetration of single abrasive particle are three representative final operation states. Adjacent to the abrasive particle, the response of the <b>target</b> <b>plate</b> to oblique impact is reflected by von Mises stress distribution and plate deformation as well. Oblique impact arouses non-symmetrical stress wave distributions and distinct unbalanced node displacements at {{the two sides of the}} abrasive particle. As for the <b>target</b> <b>plate,</b> global surface morphology is in accordance with predicted effects. The most favorable surface roughness is not associated with vertical impact, and it hinges upon the selection of standoff distance. Furthermore, variation of surface roughness with incident angle is not monotonous...|$|E
40|$|The present, paper {{deals with}} the CAE-based study Of impact of {{jacketed}} projectiles on single- and multi-layered metal armour plates using LS-DYNA. The validation of finite element modelling procedure is mainly based on the mesh convergence study using both shell and solid elements for representing single-layered mild steel <b>target</b> <b>plates.</b> It, is shown that the proper choice of mesh density and the strain rate-dependent material properties are essential for all accurate prediction of projectile residual velocity. The modelling requirements are initially arrived at by correlating against test residual velocities for single-layered mild steel plates of different depths at impact velocities in the ran. -c of approximately 800 - 870 m/s. The efficacy of correlation is adjudged, {{in terms of a}} 'correlation index', defined in the paper: for which values close to unity are desirable.
