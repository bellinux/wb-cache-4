[...] She also has expressed her ties to Australia, declaring: [...] "I {{consider myself}} very connected to Australia, in fact when people say where is home, I say Australia, because <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> most powerful memories." ...|$|E

500|$|With MiguelI {{defeated}} and in exile, and MariaII {{restored to}} the throne, Maria Amélia and her family remained in Portugal, first residing in Ramalhão Palace, {{and later in the}} Royal Palace of Queluz near Lisbon. But the war had taken its toll on Pedro's health, and he was dying of tuberculosis. Maria Amélia, who was not yet three years old, was taken during the early hours of 24 September 1834 to Pedro's deathbed. Very weak, Pedro raised his hands to bless her and said: [...] "Always tell this child of the father who loved her so dearly... not to forget me... always to obey her mother... <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> last wishes". Pedro died in the early afternoon of the same day.|$|E

Furtado described the show as a [...] "full sensory experience" [...] with [...] "a beginning, middle and end ... takes you on a journey", also stressing the importance of crowd involvement and [...] "spontaneity and rawness, because <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> roots, you know? I started by doing club shows, and that's the energy I love, the raw club energy of just feeling like you're rocking out." [...] Though Furtado said choreographed dance routines were {{to be included in the}} show, she described it as [...] "music-based ... Everything else is just to keep it sophisticated and sensual and fun." [...] Furtado said she hoped to have Chris Martin, Juanes, Justin Timberlake, Timbaland and Calle 13 to guest on the tour, and have a [...] "revolving door" [...] of opening acts with Latin musicians opening in the US.|$|E
500|$|... Yesterday, {{the woman}} {{went to the}} ala’s house with her child, the ala’s godchild. Upon {{entering}} the first room, she saw a poker and a broom fighting; in the second room, she saw human legs; in the fourth– human flesh; in the fifth– blood; in the sixth– {{she saw that the}} ala had taken off her head and was delousing it, while wearing a horse’s head in its place. After that, the ala brought lunch and said to the woman, “Eat, kuma.” “How can I eat after I saw a poker and a broom fighting in the first room?” “Eat, kuma, eat. <b>Those</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> maids: they fight about which one should take the broom and sweep.” “How can I eat after I saw human arms and legs {{in the second and third}} rooms?” And the ala told her, “Eat, kuma, eat. That is my food.” “How can I eat, kuma, after I saw the sixth room full of blood?” “Eat, kuma, eat. That is the wine that I drink.” “How can I eat after I saw that you had taken your head off and were delousing it, having fixed a horse’s head on yourself?” The ala, after hearing that, ate both the woman and her child.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 June 2014, McIlroy {{declared}} that he would represent Ireland (if he qualified) at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games, where golf became an Olympic event {{for the first time}} since 1904. In 2012 he had expressed an interest in representing Great Britain as opposed to Ireland, however in January 2013 he was considering the options of playing for Britain or Ireland or not playing at all, stating; [...] "I just think being from where we're from, we're placed in a very difficult position. I feel Northern Irish and obviously being from Northern Ireland you have a connection to Ireland and a connection to the UK. If I could and there was a Northern Irish team I'd play for Northern Ireland.

2500|$|Historian Leonard Arrington {{attributes}} {{the stories of}} Danites in Utah to overzealous descriptions of the [...] "Minute Men," [...] a law enforcement organization created by Brigham Young to pursue marauding Indians and white criminals. [...] Arthur Conan Doyle and other authors had also popularized the idea of blood-thirsty Danites riding rough-shod through Utah in various fictional works. [...] At the same time, there is evidence that, purportedly in order to deter and punish crime in Utah Territory, Brigham Young occasionally authorized local church leaders to engage in vigilante actions on an ad hoc basis. For instance, in early 1857, Young ordered local authorities to monitor two recently released convicts {{who were on the}} trail to California. If they were caught stealing livestock along the way, he authorized their summary execution. Historian Ardis Parshall believes that this led to an attack on an unrelated party which wounded several individuals in a case of mistaken identity. Indeed, in the same sermon where he spoke of the Danites and Vigilance Committees in 1857, Young also stated: [...] "There have been men here who have had their plans to arrange for robbing; and I will take the liberty to say that, when we find them, 'judgement will be laid to the line and righteousness to the plummet.' [...] <b>Those</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> feelings, and I express them plainly, that the good and honest may be able to pass from the Eastern States to California, and back and forth, in [...] peace...I want the people in the States to know that there are a few poor curses here, and to know that we do not want gangs of highwaymen here. [...] And I say to such characteres...we will send you home quick, whenever we can catch and convict you." ...|$|E

2500|$|G-Unit member Tony Yayo has {{alleged that}} Ghostface had a ghostwriter for his {{critically}} acclaimed album Supreme Clientele. In {{an interview with}} Spin magazine, Yayo claimed that Far Rockaway native Lord Superb, who guested on the album, wrote a majority, if not all, of the lyrics. In an interview with hiphopdx.com Raekwon, who also appears on the album, responded saying: [...] "He [...] know damn well he [...] ain’t write that fuckin’ album. I don’t even wanna get into shit like that, because {{it just makes me}} upset that muthafuckas be running they mouth all kinda ways.

[...] However, in a November 2007 interview with Rhapsody Music, Ghost responded with [...] "...'Perb [...] is Rae’s [...] man. He been in the studio a few times while we’re doing shit. He ain’t write shit. All ‘Perb contributed was a couple of lines that you could put in the air. When we write, we all do that.
