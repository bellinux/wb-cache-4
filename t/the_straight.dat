After months of feuding, Mysterio challenged Punk to a Straight Edge Society Pledge vs. Hair match at Over the Limit. Had Punk won, Mysterio would have joined <b>the</b> <b>Straight</b> Edge Society, Punk's faction which promoted <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> edge lifestyle. Had Mysterio won however, Punk {{agreed to have}} his head shaved. On May 14, Mysterio and Punk faced {{each other in a}} singles match, but <b>the</b> <b>Straight</b> Edge Society (Luke Gallows, Serena, and a mystery masked man) interfered and attacked Mysterio. The following week, Mysterio interrupted an initiation ceremony, in which Punk was shaving the heads of three men to induct them into <b>the</b> <b>Straight</b> Edge Society, and mocked Punk, claiming everyone would be laughing at Punk when he was shaved bald at Over the Limit. Later that night, Mysterio teamed with Montel Vontavious Porter to defeat Punk and Gallows in a tag team match.|$|E
