50|$|Opposite to {{economically}} efficient <b>trade</b> <b>creation</b> effect, {{the trade}} diversion flow is cost-inefficient {{compared with the}} rest of the world. Balance between <b>trade</b> <b>creation</b> and trade diversion effects due to the creation of economic union makes the union either economically efficient (positive balance) or inefficient (negative balance). It is based on the fact that unification of states usually applies mergers of more than 1 sector in economy (even European Coal and Steel Union, which had 2 sectors only) leading to the creation of either <b>trade</b> <b>creation</b> or diversion effects.|$|E
50|$|The {{opposite}} {{takes place}} in case of trade diversion, when the trade flow is diverted from actually cost-efficient partner state to less efficient one - but which {{became a member of}} economic union and made its goods cheaper within a union, but higher compared {{to the rest of the}} world.In practice, both <b>trade</b> <b>creation</b> and diversion effects take place due to formation of economic union. Efficiency of economic integration of specific union right now is assessed as a final outcome between <b>trade</b> <b>creation</b> and diversion effects: it is cost-effective in case of prevailing of the <b>trade</b> <b>creation</b> effects, and vice versa.|$|E

In a gravity model using panel data, we estimate a set of three regional dummies representative of intra-bloc trade, extra-bloc exports and extra-bloc imports. Taking the resulting three coefficients as a starting point, we propose an original typology of <b>trade</b> <b>creations</b> / diversions and of trading blocs. In applying it to our results, all the groups chosen as well as the Economic and Monetary Union, are shown to be building blocks. No trade diversion is noted, with the exception of an export diversion brought about by North American Free Trade Agreement...|$|R

50|$|Formulation of {{economic}} integration {{theory has been}} initiated by Jacob Viner who described <b>trade</b> <b>creation</b> and trade diversion effects caused by economic integration. They actually mean a change in direction of interregional trade flows respectively caused by the change of tariffs within and outside economic union. The dynamics of <b>trade</b> <b>creation</b> and diversion effects was mathematically described by R.T.Dalimov. The finding shows that trade flow (an output moving from region to region) may be described by Navier-Stoxes equation, with the goods flow caused by the price difference - quite similar to gas or liquid moving under pressure difference.|$|E

50|$|<b>Trade</b> <b>creation</b> is an {{economic}} term related to international economics in which trade flows are redirected due {{to the formation of}} a free trade area or a customs union.

5000|$|... "Open regionalism" [...] {{holds the}} {{potential}} to stimulate global trade and improve the efficiency of regional producers. But regional arrangements can also become a vehicle for protection, trade diversion, and unintended inefficiency. Agreements in particular between richer and poorer developing countries risk generating trade losses for the poorer ones when their imports are diverted toward the richer members whose firms are not internationally competitive. However, where regional arrangements lead to the reduction of non-tariff barriers, <b>trade</b> <b>creation</b> is likely, and the dynamic benefits of effective regional integration in terms of improved governance and regional stability are likely to outweigh diversion concerns. The World Bank suggests that key conditions to benefit from expanded trade and investment include lowering common external trade barriers, stimulating competition, reducing transaction costs, and reinforcing nondiscriminatory investment and services policies. It {{should be noted that}} the greater structural differences between North and South economies mean that North-South arrangements hold the greatest promise for economic convergence and <b>trade</b> <b>creation,</b> including in agricultural products, underlining the importance of links between South-South arrangements and northern economies.|$|E

In terms of article XXIV of GATT, the possible results of these counteracting effects are important.

This sizeable border effect might have resulted from many possible factors: <b>trade</b> diversion and <b>creation</b> due to increased protectionism and industrialisation in Korea and Formosa, certain political factors, and Japanese migration to Korea and Formosa, which contributed to a 52 % increase of bloc border effects in mainland Japan.

50|$|The {{term was}} coined by Jacob Viner in The Customs Union Issue in 1950. In its literal meaning {{the term was}} however incomplete, as it failed to capture all welfare effects of discriminatory tariff liberalization, {{and it was not}} useful when it came to {{non-tariff}} barriers. Economists have however dealt with this incompleteness in two ways. Either they stretched the original meaning to cover all welfare effects, or they introduced new terms like trade expansion or internal versus external <b>trade</b> <b>creation.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{framework}} {{of the theory of}} economic integration was laid out by Jacob Viner (1950) who defined the <b>trade</b> <b>creation</b> and trade diversion effects, the terms introduced for the change of interregional flow of goods caused by changes in customs tariffs due to the creation of an economic union. He considered trade flows between two states prior and after their unification, and compared them {{with the rest of the}} world.
