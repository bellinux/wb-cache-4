25|$|The {{difference}} is essentially whether correlations between base and supervenient properties hold within actual worlds only, or across possible worlds. For example, if psychological properties strongly locally supervene on physical properties, then any two people physically the same, in any two worlds, {{will also be}} psychologically the same. On the other hand, if psychological properties only weakly locally supervene on physical properties, then those correlations between base and supervenient properties that hold in virtue of the supervenience relation are maintained within each world, but can be different in different worlds. For example, my physical duplicates in the actual world {{will have the same}} thoughts as I have; but my physical duplicates in other possible worlds may have different thoughts <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> in the actual world.|$|E
25|$|Today, I, a faithless sinner, renew in {{your hands}} my Baptismal vows; I renounce Satan forever, his pomps and works; and I give myself entirely to Jesus Christ, the Incarnate Wisdom, and will carry my cross after Him all the days of my life, and will be more {{faithful}} to Him <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever been. With the entire heavenly court as my witness, I choose you this day for my Mother. I deliver and consecrate myself to you, my body and soul, myself, both interior and exterior, and the worth of my good actions, past, present and future; leaving to you the total right of disposing of me, and all that belongs to me, according to your wish, for the greater glory of God in time and in eternity.|$|E

500|$|In August 2010, Walker {{signed for}} Watford on a free transfer, signing a two-year contract, with Watford having the option {{on a third}} year. He made his Watford debut a day after joining the club, coming on as a 76th-minute {{substitute}} in a 0–0 draw away at Hull City. Walker also came on as a late substitute in three more games in September 2010, including in Watford's 3–1 victory against his former employers, Middlesbrough. Having made just four substitute appearances for Watford, Walker said [...] "If I'm being honest, I expected to do more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done at Watford, I still believe I should have played a lot more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> so far".|$|E

He notched {{victories}} against Nick Kyrgios, Jiří Veselý, Gilles Simon, and Marcel Granollers to reach the quarterfinals of a major {{for the first time}} in his career, becoming the first Canadian man to do so in the Open Era. He lost in the quarterfinals to Djokovic in straight sets. After the match, Raonic commented: [...] "I've gone farther in a Slam <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> before and I've learned things even from this loss." ...|$|E

He told friend Bryan Fairfax, [...] "I think the Parliament of Great Britain has no more right to put their hands in my pocket without my consent <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to put my hands into yours for money." [...] He also said that Americans must not submit to acts of tyranny [...] "till custom and use shall make us as tame and abject slaves, as the blacks we rule over with such arbitrary sway." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the course}} of his voyages in Antarctic waters, Cook had encircled the world at latitudes {{generally}} above 60°S, and saw nothing but bleak inhospitable islands, without a hint of the fertile continent which some still hoped lay in the south. Cook wrote that if any such continent existed it would be [...] "a country doomed by nature", and that [...] "no man will venture further <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done, and the land to the South will never be explored". He concluded: [...] "Should the impossible be achieved and the land attained, it would be wholly useless and of no benefit to the discoverer or his nation".|$|E

[...] "I {{have gotten}} more flak for being a conservative Republican <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> for being trans," [...] she has said. Although stopping short of an endorsement, Jenner said she liked Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, despite Cruz's negative views of trans people. On her reality show I Am Cait, Jenner said that although she does not support Donald Trump, she thinks he {{would be good for}} women's issues; she then stated she would never support Hillary Clinton. She ended up voting for Trump in the 2016 presidential elections.|$|E
500|$|Crane {{pushed himself}} to write feverishly {{during the first}} months at Brede; he told his {{publisher}} that he was [...] "doing more work now <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> at any other period in my life". [...] His health worsened, and by late 1899 he was asking friends about health resorts. [...] The Monster and Other Stories was in production and War Is Kind, his second collection of poems, {{was published in the}} United States in May. [...] None of his books after The Red Badge of Courage had sold well, and he bought a typewriter to spur output. [...] Active Service, a novella based on Crane's correspondence experience, was published in October. [...] The New York Times reviewer questioned [...] "whether the author of 'Active Service' himself really sees anything remarkable in his newspapery hero." ...|$|E

I'm seeing things in a positive light and I hope the lyrics will be more uplifting" [...] In an interview with James Spence about the early writing process and how the lyrics have an essence of self-reflection as a common theme in the band's work, [...] "it's not something people normally look at or focus on; self-reflection as a theme, but if you ignore what's happening to you and how it's making you think about things then I don't think that's good." ...|$|E
500|$|Burnley {{explained}} that writing for Dark Before Dawn was intermittent and fragmentary, taking place throughout the hiatus, {{though it was}} {{toward the end of}} the hiatus in 2013 when it became cohesive. After growing frustrated with the lack of answers regarding his health condition, Burnley decided to abandon searching for a diagnosis and focus on the album. Recorded and produced at a personal studio of Burnley's, Dark Before Dawn is the first album with the front man credited as the producer. The singer stated that [...] "I would say that I did the same amount of producing on this album as I've done on other albums, just never had my name [...] ", adding, [...] "You know, I'm not doing anything different here <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done in the past.

500|$|Sam McPherson of Zap2it {{said that}} he [...] "enjoyed 'A Christmas Carol' more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> almost any other special that has aired since the series {{restarted}} in 2005", but thought that [...] "some parts were absolutely silly, and others were absolutely incoherent" [...] due to the frantic pace. While he considered Amy and Rory [...] "criminally underused", they were responsible for [...] "heavy laughs" [...] and left the Doctor to be the [...] "delight of the episode". The Daily Telegraph Chris Harvey was less enthusiastic about the episode, saying that it [...] "started nicely", but that [...] "by {{the time she was}} singing to the shark, I'd had enough," [...] while thinking that, [...] "It's not really for old curmudgeons like me, who got more of a kick out of Michael Gambon's miserly Kazran Sardick when he was sneering and snarling {{at the beginning of the}} episode than when he had been thoroughly heartwarmed by the end." ...|$|E

500|$|Cooper was {{naturally}} reserved and introspective, {{and loved}} {{the solitude of}} outdoor activities. Not unlike his screen persona, his communication style frequently consisted of long silences with an occasional [...] "yup" [...] and [...] "shucks". He once said, [...] "If others have more interesting things to say <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> I keep quiet." [...] According to his friends, Cooper could also be an articulate, well-informed conversationalist on topics ranging from horses, guns, and Western history to film production, sports cars, and modern art. He was modest and unpretentious, frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments. His friends and colleagues described him as charming, well-mannered, and thoughtful, with a lively boyish sense of humor. Cooper maintained a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie star status—never sought special treatment or refused {{to work with a}} director or leading lady. His close friend Joel McCrea recalled, [...] "Coop never fought, he never got mad, he never told anybody off that I know of; everybody that worked with him liked him." ...|$|E
500|$|Lin {{considers}} himself {{a basketball player}} {{more than just an}} Asian American. He understands that there have not been many Asians in the NBA. [...] "Maybe I can help break the stereotype," [...] said Lin. [...] "I feel like Asians in general don't get the respect that we may deserve whether it comes to sports, basketball, or whatever it might be," [...] Lin said. Prior to the 2010–11 NBA season, Americans of Asian descent who played in the NBA included Wataru Misaka, Raymond Townsend, Corey Gaines, Rex Walters, and Robert Swift. [...] " [...] carrying the hopes of an entire continent. I only had to carry the hopes of Little Rock, Arkansas. He's accomplished a lot more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> already," [...] said Derek Fisher, who had won five NBA championships with the Lakers, after his first game against Lin. Lin is setting an example for prospective Asian athletes in America who rarely see Asian-Americans playing on their favorite teams. [...] "I don't look Japanese," [...] Walters said, referring to his mother's ethnicity. [...] "When they see , it's an Asian-American." ...|$|E
500|$|Against all expectations, the war {{continued}} for five years. During this period, PedroII's {{time and energy}} were devoted to the war effort. He tirelessly worked to raise and equip troops to reinforce the front lines and to push forward the fitting of new warships for the navy. The rape of women, widespread violence against civilians, ransacking and destruction of properties that had occurred during Paraguay's invasion of Brazilian territory had made a deep impression on him. He warned the Countess of Barral in November 1866 that [...] "the war should be concluded as honor demands, cost what it cost." [...] "Difficulties, setbacks, and war-weariness {{had no effect on}} his quiet resolve", said Barman. Mounting casualties did not distract him from advancing what he saw as Brazil's righteous cause, and he stood prepared to personally sacrifice his own throne to gain an honorable outcome. Writing in his journal a few years previously PedroII remarked: [...] "What sort of fear could I have? That they take the government from me? Many better kings <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lost it, and to me it is no more than the weight of a cross which it is my duty to carry." ...|$|E
