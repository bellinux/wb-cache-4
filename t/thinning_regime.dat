40|$|We {{determine}} the linear viscoelastic response of jammed packings of athermal repulsive viscous spheres, {{a model for}} emulsions, wet foams, and soft colloidal suspensions. We numerically measure the complex shear modulus, a fundamental characterization of the response, and demonstrate that low frequency response displays dynamic critical scaling near unjamming. Viscoelastic shear response is governed by the relaxational eigenmodes of a packing. We use scaling arguments to explain the distribution of eigenrates, which develops a divergence at unjamming. We then derive the critical exponents characterizing response, including a vanishing shear modulus, diverging viscosity, and critical shear <b>thinning</b> <b>regime.</b> Finally, we demonstrate that macroscopic rheology is sensitive to details of the local viscous force law. By varying the ratio of normal and tangential damping coefficients, we identify and explain a qualitative difference between systems with strong and weak damping of sliding motion.

40|$|We have {{constructed}} a simple one-dimensional model of capillary break-up {{to demonstrate the}} thinning behaviour of particulate suspensions previously observed in experiments. The presence of particles increases the bulk viscosity of a fluid and so is expected to retard thinning and consequently delay the time to break-up. However, experimental measurements suggest that once the filament thins to approximately five particle diameters, the thinning no longer follows the behaviour predicted by the bulk viscosity; instead thinning is “accelerated” due {{to the effects of}} finite particle size. Our model shows that accelerated thinning arises from variations in local particle density. As the filament thins, fluctuations in the local volume fraction are amplified, leading ultimately to particle-free sections in the filament. The local viscosity of the fluid is determined from the local particle density, which is found by tracking individual particles within the suspension. In regions of low particle density, the fluid is less viscous and can therefore thin more easily. Thus, we are able to model the accelerated <b>thinning</b> <b>regime</b> found in experiments. Furthermore, we observe a final <b>thinning</b> <b>regime</b> in which the thinning is no longer affected by particle dynamics but follows the behaviour of the solvent...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on {{analyses}} of permanent sample plot data gathered over periods of 10 - 34 years from an experiment in which {{a wide range of}} <b>thinning</b> <b>regimes,</b> and thinnings combined with N-fertilisation, were applied to 25 even-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands in southern Sweden (56 - 63 No). At the start of the experiment, before the first thinning, the dominant height was 12 - 18 m. The overall objective was to evaluate the extent to which growth allocation along the bole and the stand structure of Picea abies stands can be controlled by different silvicultural regimes. To do this the data were used in four studies to evaluate the impact of: thinning and N-fertilisation on stem form and taper (Study I); different <b>thinning</b> <b>regimes</b> on the removal and growth in the diameter at breast height (DBH) of individual stems (Studies II and III); and the <b>thinning</b> <b>regimes</b> on the growth in mean DBH of four classes of the largest stems by DBH ha 1 (Study IV). The studies (ii) and (iii) form a growth model. In stands subjected to different <b>thinning</b> <b>regimes,</b> one model predicts which individual trees will remain at future points in time and an associated model predicts the future DBH of the remaining stems. Separate models were developed for stands thinned from below, stands thinned from above and unthinned stands. In Study IV the actual and genuine increases in the arithmetic mean DBH of the 100, 200, 300 and 400 largest stems by DBH ha 1 associated with six different <b>thinning</b> <b>regimes</b> in periods up to 35 years were compared to the corresponding stems in unthinned stands. The goals of achieving rapid diameter growth and low stem tapering cannot be attained simultaneously as heavy thinnings cause increased tapering, and thus silvicultural regimes must reflect a compromise between these and other production objectives. Trees in thinned and N-fertilised stands had the same taper as trees in equally thinned, unfertilised stands. Heavy thinnings from below promote high frequencies of thick stems and extra heavy thinnings promote high frequencies of extra thick stems. Thinning from above (or no thinnngs) may be an alternative to thinning from below in situations where a main crop consisting of moderately thick stems would be regarded as a satisfactory outcome. The actual mean DBH of larger stems can be increased, compared to the corresponding stems in unthinned stands, by up to 2. 6 mm per year if extra heavy thinnings are carried out. The biological response to thinning of thick stems is influenced by the thinning intensity but not by the thinning method. The variation in DBH increases over time but increases more in stands thinned from above and unthinned stands than in stands thinned from below...|$|R

40|$|Variation {{in green}} density and {{moisture}} content are relevant for log transport planning, weight-scaling systems, lumber drying and dynamic assessment of stiffness. The lack of published Australian {{reports on the}} subject prompted the present study (most studies with radiata pine {{have been carried out}} in New Zealand). Patterns of variation in green density and moisture content of radiata pine as influenced by age, site, <b>thinning</b> <b>regime,</b> height in the stem and season were investigated using paired stands of mature trees (34. 5 - 36. 5 y old) on contrasting sites and with various thinning regimes, and a stand of young trees (9 y old), in the Hume region of New South Wales. Destructive samples were taken from mature trees at successive heights in the stem, and from young trees at 1. 3 m. The effect of extended drought was included by using data from separate studies. The effect of green density variation on weight scaling was determined by calculating weight-to-volume conversions for a number of stands under two climatic scenarios. Under normal climate, sapwood green density averaged about 1100 kg m- 3 and showed little variation across ages, seasons, sites, thinning regimes and height in the stem. Sapwood saturation showed small but consistent differences with age, season and height in the stem, but practically no differences with site and <b>thinning</b> <b>regime.</b> For mature trees, sapwood saturation ranged from 90 % {{at the base of the}} tree to 92 - 94 % higher up in the stem, whereas for young trees it averaged 96 % at 1. 3 m height. Heartwood green density varied greatly with height in the stem, but showed no consistent differences with site and thinning regime; it ranged from about 550 to 630 kg m- 3 at 1. 3 m height across mature stands. Heartwood saturation averaged about 7 % at 1. 3 m, decreased from the base of the tree to 10. 5 m followed by an increase up the stem, was higher in the high-altitude site and decreased slightly from winter to summer. Whole-section green density was driven by the ratio of sapwood to heartwood that in turn was affected primarily by age and height in the stem, followed by site and to a lesser extent by <b>thinning</b> <b>regime.</b> Season exerted practically no effect on whole-section green density. Whole-section green density varied considerably between mature stands, ranging from 943 to 1023 kg m- 3 at 1. 3 m height, 928 to 996 kg m- 3 at 10. 5 m, and 960 to 1016 kg m- 3 at 16 m. Whole-section green density and thus weight-to-volume conversions were significantly affected by site, age and severe drought, but not by <b>thinning</b> <b>regime</b> nor season. Using a common conversion factor between contrasting sites would lead to errors of 3 - 5 %. The errors in applying such a factor to unthinned stands under severe drought would be 10 % (large trees), 12 % (average trees) and 25 % (suppressed trees). The errors for the 9 - 10. 5 -y-old trees under normal climate would be 8 - 10 % and up to 5 % under severe drought. If a separate conversion factor was set for young trees, conversions under severe drought would have an error of 9 - 13 %. It is then advisable to determine variations in green density at site and age levels in large plantation areas with a range of growing conditions and age classes, as well as to monitor changes during extended droughts...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parametric {{study of the}} time-resolved hemispherical reflectance of a plane-parallel slab of homogeneous, cold, absorbing, and isotropically scattering medium exposed to a collimated Gaussian pulse. The front surface of the slab is transparent while the back surface {{is assumed to be}} cold and black. The I-D time-dependent radiation transfer equation is solved using the modified method of characteristics. The parameters explored include (1) the optical thickness, (2) the single scattering albedo of the medium, and (3) the incident pulse width. The study pays particular attention to the maximum transient hemispherical reflectance and identifies optically <b>thin</b> and thick <b>regimes.</b> It shows that the maximum reflectance is independent of the optical thickness in the optically thick regime. In the optically <b>thin</b> <b>regime,</b> however, the maximum hemispherical reflectance depends on all three parameters explored. The transition between the optically thick and <b>thin</b> <b>regimes</b> occurs when the optical thickness is approximately equal to the dimensionless pulse width. Finally, correlations relating the maximum of the hemispherical reflectance {{as a function of the}} optical thickness, the single scattering albedo of the materials, and the incident pulse width have been developed. These correlations could be used to retrieve radiation characteristics or serve as initial guesses for more complex inversion schemes accounting for anisotropic scattering. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} of this work was to select, using operational research techniques, management regimes of Pinus taeda L. that maximize the revenue generated by the wood, considering different attractiveness rates. The OpTimber-LP® software, which performs the simulations using SisPinus® software, was used for forest optimization. The regimes consisted of different combinations of forest sites, planting densities, <b>thinning</b> <b>regimes</b> and clearcutting ages, totaling 17, 760 regimes per site. Wood production was quantified and evaluated by assortment classes. Planting, thinning and harvesting costs were considered. The Annualized Net Present Value (ANPV) and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of each management regime were calculated. As a result, the density of 1, 600 plants per ha optimized ANPV for most cases. Optimized regimes included no or only one thinning and provided ANPV of 2, 753 and 158 BRL per ha and IRR of 22. 9 % and 2. 9 % for sites I and IV, respectively. It was concluded that the optimal number of thinning is reduced in lower quality sites, and the less productive the site, the later the optimal year for clearcutting.
