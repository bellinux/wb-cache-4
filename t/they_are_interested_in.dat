25|$|In the United States, for example, {{most major}} {{holidays}} now {{are represented by}} rationalized, secularized figures which serve as a corporate totem.

In these societies, {{the value of a}} gift {{is more likely to be}} weighed by objective measures (i.e. monetary value) than subjective (i.e. symbolism).|$|E

The males anchor themselves firmly to the surface onto which they have crawled and then use their legs to transmit vibrations from their bodies to the surface. Most of the sound emitted is produced by strong vibrations of the abdomen. The characteristic frequency of vibration and the pattern of bursts of sound identify them to females of their species, who will approach if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> mating.|$|E

25|$|First {{identified}} at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in 1925, {{art deco}} shares some characteristics of expressionism {{and is likely}} to have been influenced directly by the Expressionist movement - particularly the activities of the Weimar Bauhaus - and more generally with the factors and politics that influenced both movements at the time, such as socialism and mechanisation. In common with art nouveau and expressionism <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> decorative effects that break with the past and reflect a new modernity. The bold use of zigzag and stepped forms, and sweeping curves and chevron patterns. New materials are employed in new ways such as glass, aluminum, and stainless steel.

25|$|Air : The air {{signs are}} Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. A native with mainly air signs {{will be an}} {{excellent}} communicator, concerned with ideas and theories of all kinds. They are looking for answers to life's questions and make good teachers and writers. Air people are more tense than they appear at first sight and may live on their nerves. They have many friends and acquaintances but may not be particularly interested in family life. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the latest technologies {{and are able to}} do a number of things at once. Air subjects are also very imaginative and quick-witted, but may be sarcastic and rude. A subject lacking air signs will have little imagination and lightness of touch. They have an over-emphasis on practicalities and can lack a sense of humour, and be boring company. They can find it difficult to communicate or to assimilate and explain new ideas. Planets in the 3rd, 7th and 11th houses, and an emphasis on mutable signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E

500|$|LeMond grew {{up living}} an active, outdoor life. Hiking, hunting, skiing and flyfishing were boyhood pastimes.

[...] "I was a boy who just could not sit still. I had trouble focusing in school. Parents and educators then did not have the skill set to diagnose and cope with what we know now was a classic case of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD certainly was not the frequently medicated childhood disease it is today. My triumph over the symptoms was found atop two thin tires over many dusty miles." [...] Said LeMond: [...] "That's one of the traits. It's the inability to sit down [...] to something you are not really interested in and absorb it. If <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> it, people with ADD excel in really good ways. When I got into cycling I would say the sport itself took a fog off my brain. I was able to absorb stuff I read. It changed my life." ...|$|E
