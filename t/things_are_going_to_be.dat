I told her this morning what I thought of her for forgetting to feed the donkey. I was prepared, of course, for a hundred explanations: First, that she had meant to feed the donkey; secondly, that it wasn't her place to feed the donkey; thirdly, that the donkey would have been fed if circumstances over which she had no control had not arisen rendering it impossible for her to feed the donkey; fourthly, that the morning wasn't the proper time to feed the donkey, and so on. Instead of which, out she whips this ridiculous book and asks me if I would mind saying it over again.|$|E

5000|$|Buffy {{reflects}} on her {{long history of}} being a Slayer and awakening the thousands of other girls around the world. In flashbacks of her narrative {{it is clear that}} in each battle the Scoobies and the others have fought came with sacrifice, but in a way, came with connection as well. Buffy admits that while it can be a bother sacrificing her life as well as others, it has always been done for the better. She has grown, she has moved on to the better and potential she always knew that she could live up to. Next, Xander and Buffy discuss a major problem: Simone Doffler.

Xander comforts her and reassures her that <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> all right. The two then reflect on the revelation that Buffy stole from a lucrative bank to support her and the Slayer army and how she and Willow are having complex issues. Xander suggests that she ease her worries by going on a vampire hunt; Buffy decides to bring a [...] "date", namely Satsu.|$|E
50|$|The chapter {{starts off}} with Zeke trying to bargain with a lady that Cole will charge her battery if she gives them food. She thinks they're crazy, and when Cole charges the battery, she sees them as freaks and runs away. Zeke {{tries to get}} her but Cole stops him. Zeke keeps talking about how she screwed them over while Cole holds him back. Unknown to them, John is {{keeping an eye on}} Cole. He sees what happened, and thinks that if his powers keep growing like this, Cole will be able to help him regain the Ray Sphere and that he's going to need {{to keep an eye on}} Cole.

Then the civilians are sprayed with black tar. The scene goes back to Zeke and Cole as they're heading back to their place, when all of a sudden a man barges through them. Cole then recommends that they hurry up, as the streets aren't safe anymore. As they're running back, they see fights, vandalism, all kinds of crime. They get back to Zeke's place and tell Trish about what's happening in the city. All of them go on the roof, and look out over the city. They see it as a huge mess, with fires, broken buildings, and a broken bridge. Cole comments on how bad it is, and Zeke talks about barricading the roof to make a safe place for them. Zeke then predicts that <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> much worse, and then the comic ends, and the inFamous story begins.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, Dylan {{appeared}} on several tribute albums, including Endless Highway: The Music of The Band and Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur, a charity album consisting of covers of John Lennon songs. On Endless Highway, Dylan performed {{a cover of}} The Band's [...] "Whispering Pines." [...] For Instant Karma, Dylan performed a cover of Lennon's [...] "Gimme Some Truth," [...] with Dhani Harrison contributing backing vocals on the song.In September 2007, it was reported by The New York Times that Dylan was recording his first solo album at producer, Rick Rubin's home in the Hollywood Hills. [...] Regarding its sparse instrumentation and production, Dylan described {{the differences in the}} writing process for Seeing Things, compared to writing for the Wallflowers: [...] A lot of times when you write songs, you’re aware that this line is just going to help you get to the next line and someone's probably going to do an organ fill right there anyway - you can let those go. But with something like this, it was just three instruments, really; vocals being one of the instruments, which then makes the lyrics being one of the instruments. You’re more aware that <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more exposed and you can’t really let anything go unless you’re confident that this is what you want to say. Following the completion of recording in 2007, Seeing Things was released on June 10, 2008. [...] The album received generally favorable reviews and peaked at No.24 in the U.S. on the Billboard 200. [...] Following the release of Seeing Things, Dylan made several television appearances to promote the album and toured with a backing band called The Gold Mountain Rebels, which consisted of Wallflowers drummer Fred Eltringham, guitarist Audley Freed and bassist George Reif. In the summer and fall of 2008, Dylan and the Gold Mountain Rebels played a combination of theaters and festivals in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, including Farm Aid in Mansfield, Massachusetts and the Newport Folk Festival. In addition to touring with the Gold Mountain Rebels, Dylan and Eltringham also performed several shows with the Wallflowers in 2008.|$|E
