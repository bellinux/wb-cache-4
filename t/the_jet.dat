5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> stream was {{at least}} {{partly responsible for the}} widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States. Normally, <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> stream flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and other areas of the Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.|$|E
5|$|Upper-level jet streams.

The CAT is strongest on the anticyclonic shear side of <b>the</b> <b>jet,</b> usually next to or just below the axis of <b>the</b> <b>jet.</b>|$|E

5|$|Associated with jet streams is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear-air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear caused by jet streams. The CAT is strongest on the cold air side of <b>the</b> <b>jet,</b> next to and just under the axis of <b>the</b> <b>jet.</b> Clear-air turbulence can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents, such as {{the death of one}} passenger on United Airlines Flight 826.|$|E

5|$|Climate {{scientists}} have hypothesized that <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> stream will gradually weaken {{as a result}} of global warming. Trends such as Arctic sea ice decline, reduced snow cover, evapotranspiration patterns, and other weather anomalies are expected to make the Arctic heat up faster than other parts of the globe. This in turn reduces the temperature gradient that drives jet stream winds, causing <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> stream to become weaker and more variable in its course.|$|E

5|$|It is {{different}} for places with a Mediterranean climate. In the western United States, {{during the cold}} season from September–May, extratropical cyclones from the Pacific Ocean move inland into the region due to a southward migration of <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> stream during the cold season. This shift in <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the region, and sometimes also brings heavy rain and strong low pressure systems. The peninsula of Italy has weather {{very similar to the}} western United States in this regard.|$|E
5|$|Meteorologists use the {{location}} of some of <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> streams as an aid in weather forecasting. The main commercial relevance of <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> streams is in air travel, as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against, which results in significant fuel and time cost savings for airlines. Often, the airlines work to fly 'with' <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> stream for this reason. Dynamic North Atlantic Tracks are {{one example of how}} airlines and air traffic control work together to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> stream and winds aloft that results in the maximum benefit for airlines and other users. Clear-air turbulence, a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety, is often found in a jet stream's vicinity, but it does not create a substantial alteration on flight times. These are a narrow belt.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} from Jacksonville International Airport, Florida, several hours before the accident, although the departure from Jacksonville was delayed by poor weather over New York {{and the removal of}} the baggage of a passenger who decided not to board <b>the</b> <b>jet.</b> The instrument approach landing was uneventful and <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> was not significantly delayed while in the air waiting to land, however congestion on the taxiways at LaGuardia delayed the arrival of the aircraft at the gate.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} investigation {{revealed that}} due to pilot error, inadequate deicing procedures at LaGuardia, and several lengthy delays, {{a large amount of}} ice had accumulated on the wings and airframe. This ice disrupted airflow over <b>the</b> <b>jet,</b> increasing drag and reducing lift, which prevented <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> from lifting off the runway.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the flight crew were unaware of the amount of ice that had built up after <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> was delayed by heavy ground traffic taxiing to the runway. The report also listed the fact that the aircraft had begun its takeoff rotation too early at a lower speed than was standard as a contributing factor to the accident.|$|E
