25|$|Jeremiah Joseph Duggan {{received}} fatal {{head injuries}} {{when he ran}} into the road in Wiesbaden and was hit by two private motor cars. What other fact do we know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> add? I really must add that he had earlier been {{in a state of}} terror. It is a word not commonly used in a Coroner's court but no other word would reflect his state of mind at the time.|$|E
25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E

500|$|In 2009, McCartney {{wrote to}} Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, asking {{him why he}} was not a vegetarian. As McCartney explained, [...] "He wrote back very kindly, saying, 'my doctors tell me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> eat meat'. And I wrote back again, saying, you know, I don't think that's right... I think he's now being told... that he can get his protein somewhere else... It just doesn't seem right—the Dalai Lama, on the one hand, saying, 'Hey guys, don't harm sentient beings... Oh, and by the way, I'm having a steak.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Feng {{also participated}} in the women's team {{competition}} with Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu. They were beaten 0–3 by Japan in the semifinals, but took the bronze medal by edging out South Korea 3–0. Feng defeated Kim Kyung Ah 11–9, 11–8, 4–11, 13–11, Li also successfully fended off Seok Ha Jung 11–5, 11–8, 6–11, 11–8. Li and Wang then succeeded in the doubles game against Seok and Dang Ye Seo 11–9, 11–6, 6–11, 11–5. This {{marked the first time}} Singapore had won more than one medal at an Olympic Games. Feng commented: [...] "Against Japan, we gave ourselves too much pressure and lost the psychological battle. After that, I told myself <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> prepare myself well mentally and it's only when I do what I'm capable of that I can win." ...|$|E
500|$|At 04:50 on 5 June, Yamamoto ordered Akagi scuttled, {{saying to}} his staff, [...] "I {{was once the}} captain of Akagi, and it is with heartfelt regret <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> now order that she be sunk." [...] Destroyers Arashi, Hagikaze, Maikaze, and Nowaki each fired one torpedo into the carrier and she sank, bow first, at 05:20 at [...] Two hundred and sixty-seven men of the ship's crew were lost, the fewest {{of any of the}} Japanese fleet {{carriers}} lost in the battle. The loss of Akagi and the three other IJN carriers at Midway, comprising two thirds of Japan's total number of fleet carriers and the experienced core of the First Air Fleet, was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan's ultimate defeat in the war. In an effort to conceal the defeat, Akagi was not immediately removed from the Navy's registry of ships, instead being listed as [...] "unmanned" [...] before finally being struck from the registry on 25 September 1942.|$|E

500|$|Although her {{research}} was progressing at Missouri, McClintock was {{not satisfied with}} her position at the University. She recalled being excluded from faculty meetings, and was not made aware of positions available at other institutions. In 1940, she wrote to Charles Burnham, [...] "I have decided <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> look for another job. As far as I can make out, {{there is nothing more}} for me here. I am an assistant professor at $3,000 and I feel sure that that is the limit for me." [...] Initially, McClintock's position was created especially for her by Stadler, and might have depended on his presence at the university. McClintock believed she would not gain tenure at Missouri, even though according to some accounts, she knew she would be offered a promotion from Missouri in the spring of 1942. Recent evidence reveals that McClintock more likely decided to leave Missouri because she had lost trust in her employer and in the University administration, after discovering that her job would be in jeopardy if Stadler were to leave for Caltech, as he had considered doing. The university's retaliation against Stadler amplified her sentiments.|$|E
500|$|Prince Carol {{sparked a}} dynastic crisis when he officially renounced his rights to succeed Ferdinand on 5 January 1926, {{simultaneously}} waiving all parental rights over Prince Michael, {{who had been}} proclaimed heir apparent. A Provisional Regency Bill was passed, creating a regency council composed of Prince Nicholas; the Orthodox Patriarch, Miron Cristea; and Gheorghe Buzdugan, {{the president of the}} Court of Cassation. However, both Marie and Ferdinand were reluctant to leave the country {{in the hands of a}} five-year-old boy, even overseen by a regency, for fear that the lands gained during World War I would be reclaimed by neighbouring countries and that political disturbances might lead to civil unrest. Nevertheless, when Marie returned from America, Ferdinand's death seemed imminent. He was suffering from intestinal cancer, and by April 1927 had come so close to death as to be given the last rites of the Catholic Church. He died on 20 July, in Marie's arms. She later wrote: [...] "'I am so tired' were his last words and when he lay so quiet in my arms one hour later, I knew <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> thank God for him at least. This was rest indeed." ...|$|E
500|$|Spector made various {{changes to}} the songs. His most {{dramatic}} embellishments occurred on 1 April 1970, the last ever Beatles recording session, when he added orchestral overdubs to [...] "The Long and Winding Road", [...] "Across the Universe" [...] and [...] "I Me Mine" [...] at Abbey Road Studios. The {{only member of the}} Beatles present was Starr, who played drums with the session musicians to create Spector's characteristic [...] "Wall of Sound". Already known for his eccentric behaviour in the studio, Spector was in a peculiar mood that day, according to balance engineer Peter Bown: [...] "He wanted tape echo on everything, he had to take a different pill every half hour and had his bodyguard with him constantly. He was on the point of throwing a wobbly, saying 'I want to hear this, I want to hear <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> have this, I must have that.'" [...] The orchestra became so annoyed by Spector's behaviour that the musicians refused to play any further; at one point, Bown left for home, forcing Spector to telephone him and persuade him into coming back after Starr had told Spector to calm down.|$|E

500|$|... "Russian Roulette" [...] {{begins with}} a [...] "searing" [...] guitar solo that later {{transitions}} into a [...] "pulsing" [...] beat which stays constant {{until the end of}} the song. The single opens with the lyrics, [...] "Take a breath/ Take it deep/ Calm yourself/ He says to me/ If you play/ You play for keeps/ Take the gun/ And count to three." [...] The metaphor about the game of Russian roulette is also present in the chorus in which Rihanna sings, [...] "And you can see my heart beating/ You can see it through my chest/ I said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving/ I know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> pass this test/ So just pull the trigger." [...] In the upcoming verse, the character that the singer portrays in the song it's scared that the man talking to her will always have a power over, [...] "Say a prayer to yourself/ He says close your eyes/ Sometimes it helps/ And then I get a scary thought/ That he's here means he's never lost." [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] ends with a sound of a gun shot, which according to Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club extends the drama accompanied by [...] "harrowing scenarios and tremulous vocals".|$|E
500|$|But Shankly soon regretted his {{decision}} {{and tried to}} continue his involvement with the club, mainly by turning up for team training at Melwood. He said he still wanted the involvement as the club had become his life. He soon stopped going to Melwood because he felt there was some resentment and people were asking {{what he was doing}} there. He felt unwanted, but [...] "I never resented the club after I left, as some stupid person wrote in the paper." [...] He still attended matches, but sat in the stand away from the directors and staff. He was especially annoyed that Liverpool did not invite him to attend away matches as the club's guest. When, finally, he was invited to travel with them to the away leg of the 1976 UEFA Cup Final in Bruges, he was accommodated in a separate hotel and said he found that insulting. Shankly contrasted Liverpool's attitude with what he encountered at other clubs, including Liverpool's great rivals Everton and Manchester United, where he was received warmly. He recalled Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty's reply to a Liverpool director: [...] "Aye, Bill's welcome here". About Everton, once his greatest rivals, he wrote: [...] "I have been received more warmly by Everton than I have by Liverpool. It is a scandal <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> write these words about the club I helped to build".|$|E

Scurvy broke out, and in October 1788 Phillip had to send Sirius to Cape Town for supplies, and strict rationing was introduced, with thefts of food punished by hanging. Arthur Phillip quoted [...] "The living conditions need to improve or my men won't work as hard, so I {{have come to a}} conclusion <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> hire surgeons to fix the convicts." ...|$|E
