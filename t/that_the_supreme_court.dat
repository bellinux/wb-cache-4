5|$|In United States federal courts, {{a circuit}} split occurs when {{two or more}} {{different}} circuit courts of appeals provide conflicting rulings on the same legal issue. The existence of a circuit split {{is one of the}} factors <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> of the United States considers when deciding whether to grant review of a case. Some scholars suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> is more likely to grant review of a case to resolve a circuit split than for any other reason.|$|E
5|$|Since {{this case}} {{challenged}} {{the authority of}} the federal courts to try Indian-on-Indian crime, this case was heard as an interlocutory appeal, meaning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> would have to decide the constitutionality of the claimed jurisdiction before Kagama could be tried for the killing of Iyouse in federal court.|$|E
5|$|Brennan then {{noted that}} the {{principles}} of statutory construction as regards to Indians were very specific. Any differences in possible interpretation must be resolved {{in favor of the}} tribe or the Indian. Since Minnesota's interpretation did not meet any of these tests regarding either the consent of Congress to tax or of statutory construction, Brennan stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> would not follow the state's reasoning, and reversed the lower court's decision.|$|E
50|$|The Third Circuit, on remand, found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court's</b> {{decision}} gave Bond {{standing to}} raise federalism {{questions about the}} federal government's power to enforce legislation that implements a treaty. However, the circuit court found <b>that,</b> under <b>the</b> 1920 <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> precedent Missouri v. Holland, the legislation was indisputably valid because the treaty is valid.|$|R
50|$|On 28 June 2008 the Washington Post {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court's</b> {{ruling in}} Boumediene v. Bush would allow Mohammed Sulaymon Barre {{to file a}} habeas corpus petition.J. Wells Dixon will be representing him.|$|R
50|$|In June 2013, Pruitt {{maintained}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court's</b> {{decision to}} strike down a provision of DOMA, a federal law that denied federal benefits to homosexual married couples did not affect Oklahoma's laws on the subject.|$|R
5|$|The {{court also}} reviews death penalty cases, state tax court appeals, and items {{regarding}} legal discipline on direct review. Direct review means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> hears cases directly upon appeal without the case first {{going to the}} Court of Appeals. Other direct review items include state agency decisions such as the placement of prisons, placement of energy production facilities, locations of sites for solid waste disposal, and some labor law injunctions. Additionally, the court has original jurisdiction in, writs of mandamus, writs quo warranto, writs of habeas corpus, reapportionment of state legislative districts, and challenges to ballot measures such as their titles, the fiscal impact statement, and the explanatory statement as listed in the Voter’s Pamphlet.|$|E
5|$|Censorship was {{commonplace in}} the early 20th century. State laws and city {{ordinances}} routinely outlawed speech deemed to be obscene or offensive, and prohibited meetings or literature that promoted unions or labor organization. Starting in 1926, the ACLU began to expand its free speech activities to encompass censorship of art and literature. In that year, H. L. Mencken deliberately broke Boston law by distributing copies of his banned American Mercury magazine; the ACLU defended him and won an acquittal. The ACLU {{went on to win}} additional victories, including the landmark case United States v. One Book Called Ulysses in 1933, which reversed a ban by the Customs Department against the book Ulysses by James Joyce. The ACLU only achieved mixed results {{in the early}} years, and it was not until 1966 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> finally clarified the obscenity laws in the Roth v. United States and Memoirs v. Massachusetts cases.|$|E
5|$|On July 15, 1835, {{tensions}} and emotions finally overflowed and blood was spilled. Monroe County, Michigan, Deputy Sheriff Joseph Wood went into Toledo to arrest Major Benjamin Stickney, but when Stickney {{and his three}} sons resisted, the whole family was subdued and taken into custody. During the scuffle, Two Stickney, son of the major, stabbed Wood with a pen knife and fled south into Ohio. Wood's injuries were not life-threatening. When Lucas refused Mason's demand to extradite Two Stickney back to Michigan for trial, Mason wrote to President Jackson for help, suggesting that the matter be referred to the United States Supreme Court. At {{the time of the}} conflict it was not established <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> could resolve state boundary disputes, and Jackson declined the offer. Looking for peace, Lucas began making his own efforts to end the conflict, again through federal intervention via Ohio's congressional delegation.|$|E
5000|$|Waite {{refused to}} pass {{judgment}} on {{the validity of the}} writ of habeas corpus, concluding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court's</b> [...] "jurisdiction is limited to the single question {{of the power of the}} court to commit the prisoner for the act of which he has been convicted." ...|$|R
50|$|The Rebuilding Alliance and Gush Shalom state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court's</b> {{decision}} is seriously flawed {{because it is}} based on grave misrepresentations and omission of facts.

5|$|Bruce was {{followed}} by Lawrence N. Maxwell, counsel for Beckham. Maxwell reiterated that the General Assembly had acted within its enumerated powers under the state constitution in deciding {{the outcome of the}} disputed election. He claimed that the decision of the state court of appeals made it clear that Taylor had not been legally elected governor, and therefore never possessed the property he was now claiming had been taken from him without due process. Maxwell further asserted that this disposed of any federal questions with regard to the case, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> could claim no jurisdiction. The decision of the state court of appeals should be allowed to stand, he concluded. Lewis McQuown further argued on behalf of Beckham that, even if Taylor's claim to the governorship were legitimate, the investigation and decision by the General Assembly's contest committee represented sufficient due process. He acknowledged that the Goebel Election Law's provision that the legislature be the arbiter of any contested gubernatorial election differed little if at all from provisions in as many as twenty other states. If the Goebel Election Law was constitutional, as it had before been declared, then the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction regarding how it had been administered.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions had in {{the year}} since {{publication}} received highly critical replies from state legislatures. Seven states formally responded to Virginia and Kentucky by rejecting the Resolutions and three other states passed resolutions expressing disapproval, with the other four states taking no action. No other state endorsed the Resolutions. The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly, led in the effort by state-sovereignty advocate John Taylor of Caroline, had put a state-sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison's hopes. These replies contended <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> of the United States had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional, and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary. The Federalists accused the Democratic-Republicans of seeking disunion, even contemplating violence. At the time, some leading Virginia Democratic-Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles (in public) and Taylor (in private) actually were contemplating disunion, and the Virginia General Assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond, so there was some truth to the charge.|$|E

2500|$|Though Brown v. Board of Education (1954) {{overruled}} the Plessy v.
