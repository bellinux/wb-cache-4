5|$|In West African cultures, {{women with}} long hair were highly valued. Long, <b>thick</b> <b>hair</b> {{was seen as a}} sign of health, strength, and {{capability}} to bear many children. In keeping with this general theme, women who were too young for marriage would shave a portion of their heads to signal so. This tradition, however, did not extend to every West African culture, as several valued shorter hair.|$|E
5|$|Males having short, cut hair {{are in many}} {{cultures}} viewed as being under society's control, such as while in the military or prison or as punishment for a crime. Although recently in The United States {{it has become more}} socially acceptable and more common for men to have hair reaching {{all the way down to}} their upper back. Long, <b>thick</b> <b>hair</b> has been a sign of wealth, power or prominence throughout time and history.|$|E
25|$|Halfway {{through the}} series, Kilala {{experiences}} a hair style change {{thanks to her}} mother. Her hair is thinner and longer, contrasting to her <b>thick</b> <b>hair</b> before. Kilala's three curls are looser, and the braid at the back is replaced with red beads.|$|E

5000|$|The {{opposite}} of hypotrichosis is hypertrichosis, where terminal <b>hair</b> (<b>thick)</b> grows {{in areas that}} would otherwise normally have vellus hair (thin), for example abnormally <b>thick</b> facial <b>hair</b> growth in women.|$|R
25|$|These {{different}} influences (Ionian and Athenian) {{mean that}} even today {{the identification of}} the statue is not possible. However, according to some stylistic and technical criteria, the statue belongs to Attic sculpture of the Archaic period (<b>thick</b> <b>hair,</b> receding chin, almond shaped eyes) while undergoing Ionian influence (chiselled rounding, softened facial lines) which increased {{at the end of the}} sixth century. It must however be noted that the Ionian elements are in the majority, notably the typically Ionian long-sleeved chiton, the Ionian himation and the polos decorated with lotus flowers and palmettes. However the material, Pentalic marble from north of Athens, and the rigorous composition settle the question in favour of an Attic origin.|$|E
25|$|If the {{dressage}} rider {{has long}} hair, it is typically worn {{in a bun}} with a hair net or show bow. A hair net blends in with the rider's hair color, whereas a show bow combines a barrette or hair tie with a small bow and <b>thick</b> <b>hair</b> net, and is usually black. Lower-level riders may use a derby, hunting cap, or ASTM/SEI-approved Equestrian helmet. In the United States, junior riders and riders through Fourth Level at recognized competitions are required to wear an ASTM/SEI approved helmet to protect against head trauma {{in the event of}} a fall. At the upper levels, a top hat that matches the rider's coat is traditionally worn, though use of helmets is legal and increasing in popularity.|$|E
25|$|Marsupial moles {{spend most}} of their time underground, coming to the surface only occasionally, {{probably}} mostly after rains. They are blind, their eyes having become reduced to vestigial lenses under the skin, and they have no external ears, just a pair of tiny holes hidden under <b>thick</b> <b>hair.</b> The head is cone-shaped, with a leathery shield over the muzzle, the body is tubular, and the tail is a short, bald stub. They are between 12 and 16cm long, weigh 40 to 60grams, and are uniformly covered in fairly short, very fine pale cream to white hair with an iridescent golden sheen. Their pouch has evolved to face backwards so it does not fill with sand, and contains just two teats, so the animal cannot bear more than two young at a time.|$|E

25|$|Both men {{and women}} have visible hair on the head, eyebrows, eyelashes, armpits, pubic region, arms, and legs; men and some women also have <b>thicker</b> <b>hair</b> on their face, abdomen, back and chest. Hair does not {{generally}} grow on the lips, the underside of the hands or feet or on certain areas of the genitalia.|$|R
50|$|Mohair fiber is {{approximately}} 25-45 microns in diameter. It increases in diameter with {{the age of}} the goat, growing along with the animal. Fine hair from younger animals is used for finer applications such as clothing, and the <b>thicker</b> <b>hair</b> from older animals is more often used for carpets and heavy fabrics intended for outerwear.|$|R
500|$|Shepard was tall, with a {{pleasant}} expression and manner, and The New York Times {{called him the}} [...] "perfect type of well-bred clubman". He had <b>thick</b> <b>hair,</b> manicured nails, a well-trimmed beard and an athletic figure. An opponent of antisemitism, he attended dinners publicizing the plight of Russian Jews and regularly addressed Jewish religious and social organizations avoided by others. He rented pews in many New York churches, supported about a dozen missionaries and {{was described as a}} generous donor to hospitals and charitable societies. Shepard was politically ambitious, and decided to build Woodlea as a symbol of power and influence. Shepard had horses and carriages which were ridden by the family in parks, and he prided himself on his equestrianism. Shepard was a long-time friend of US Senator Chauncey Depew.|$|E
2500|$|Ruddy, with a {{pock-marked}} face, barely any nose, scrofulous, {{his neck}} enfolded in cloth that protected and hid his affliction, pot-bellied; [...] mouth smiling, lips <b>thick,</b> <b>hair</b> rare, eyebrows absent, {{dressed like a}} little lackey aping his master and with the affectations and the mincing airs of the salon (quoted in Kelly, 2004 – see below).|$|E
2500|$|Warriors were {{sometimes}} rallied into battle by blowing horns and warpipes. According to Gerald de Barri (in the 12th century), {{they did not}} wear armour, as they deemed it burdensome to wear and [...] "brave and honourable" [...] to fight without it. Instead, most ordinary soldiers fought semi-naked and carried only their weapons and a small round shield—Spenser wrote that these shields were covered with leather and painted in bright colours. Kings and chiefs sometimes went into battle wearing helmets adorned with eagle feathers. For ordinary soldiers, their <b>thick</b> <b>hair</b> often served as a helmet, but they sometimes wore simple helmets made from animal hides.|$|E
40|$|Visual {{method of}} hair {{analysis}} in medicine is called phototrichogrametry. Method {{is based on}} the interpretation of two image showing the physical changes of the hair. The photos are taken in green light, exposing both thin and <b>thick</b> <b>hairs.</b> By the help of the software the density of facial hair is determined and intensity of growth is assessed...|$|R

5000|$|The male is unknown. The female has a {{cephalothorax}} that is one-and-a-half {{times as}} long as wide and weakly convex dorsally. It has no eyes. It is about 1mm long. The cephalothorax, appendages and sternum are tawny. The abdomen is whitish. The dorsal side of the chelicerae are adorned {{with a series of}} simple hairs with a row of feathery, <b>thick</b> <b>hairs.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Electronic louse combs {{use a small}} {{electrical}} charge to kill lice. The metal teeth of the comb have alternating positively and negatively charged tines, which are powered by a small battery. When the comb is used on dry hair, lice make contact with multiple tines of the fine-toothed comb, thereby closing the circuit and receiving an {{electrical charge}}. A non-peer-reviewed letter has been published in a dermatology journal claiming effectiveness based on personal experience (total of 6 uses). For those with long or fine hair, the metal long tooth combs seem to snag and pull hair. Metal combs may be better for <b>thick</b> <b>hair,</b> while plastic short-tooth combs are best used for treating long and fine hair.|$|E

2500|$|The {{body has}} {{different}} types of hair, including vellus hair and androgenic hair, {{each with its own}} type of cellular construction. [...] The different construction gives the hair unique characteristics, serving specific purposes, mainly warmth and protection. Most humans develop the longest <b>thickest</b> <b>hair</b> on their scalps and (mostly observed in males) faces. This hair will usually grow to several feet before terminating, but many humans develop much longer hair.|$|R

60|$|Dorn looked {{aggressive}} and stern. Suddenly his hand flashed out to snatch off the slouch-hat which hid the fellow's face. Amazingly, a gray wig came with it. This {{man was not}} old. He had fair <b>thick</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
50|$|Contraction of {{the muscles}} {{has a number of}} {{different}} purposes. Its principal function in the majority of mammals is to provide insulation: air becomes trapped between the erect hairs, helping the animal retain heat. Erection of the porcupine's long, <b>thick</b> <b>hairs</b> causes the animal to become more intimidating, scaring predators. Pressure exerted by the muscle may cause sebum to be forced along the hair follicle towards the surface, protecting the hair.|$|R
50|$|The Brujo chilote {{transforms}} the child into a deformed hairy monster by breaking {{his right leg}} and twisting it over his back. When the boy is three months old his tongue is forked and the warlock applies a magic cream over the boy's back to cause <b>thick</b> <b>hairs.</b> During its first months the invunche is fed on black cat's milk and goat flesh, and then with human flesh from cemeteries.|$|R

In addition, gorillas that live in lowland forests are more slender and agile than the more bulky mountain gorillas. The eastern gorilla also has a longer face and broader chest than the western gorilla.|$|R
