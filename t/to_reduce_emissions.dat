5|$|As {{the energy}} and liquid fossil fuels were {{about to enter the}} NZ ETS in July 2010, Wright {{expressed}} her concern that although the NZ ETS was the right framework, the subsidies to big emitters would limit the incentives <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>emissions</b> and impose significant costs on the taxpayer.|$|E
5|$|Eurostar's current {{target is}} <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>emissions</b> by 35 percent per {{passenger}} journey by 2012, putting itself beyond {{the efforts of}} other railway companies in this field and thereby winning the 2007 Network Rail Efficiency Award.|$|E
5|$|In November 2009, Wright was {{sufficiently}} {{concerned that the}} Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment bill would result in increased emissions that she publicly urged politicians three times not to adopt the National Government's legislation. She opposed the removal of a firm cap on emissions, the reduction of price incentives <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>emissions,</b> and the heavy subsidies from taxpayers granted to emissions-intensive industry and agriculture by the intensity-based allocation of free units.|$|E

5|$|On 6 December 2007, the New Zealand Emission Unit Register (NZEUR) was established. The NZEUR has {{the role}} of issuing, holding, {{transferring}} and retiring emission units {{in terms of the}} Kyoto Protocol. The initial use of the NZEUR was to record Kyoto emission units allocated to firms enrolled in the Ministry for the Environment’s Projects <b>to</b> <b>Reduce</b> <b>Emissions</b> and Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements programmes, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry’s Permanent Forest Sink Initiative.|$|E
5|$|Dalhousie University is {{actively}} involved in sustainability issues and has received a number of sustainability awards and recognition for academic programs, university operations, and research. In 2015, Dalhousie received a GOLD rating from AASHE STARS (Version 2.0). In 2009, the university signed the University and College Presidents’ Climate Change Statement of Action for Canada <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>emissions</b> of greenhouse gases. Dalhousie is also a signatory of UNEP's International Declaration on Cleaner Production. In 1999, the university signed the Talloires Declaration, which committed Dalhousie and other higher education institutions to developing, creating, supporting, and maintaining sustainability.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} recognises {{that there}} are no viable alternative aviation fuels, and whilst it accepts that the exemption of aviation fuel from fuel tax is anomalous, it sees no scope for a unilateral approach in addressing this. The strategy adopted in the White Paper seeks to mitigate the global impact of air transport primarily through emissions trading schemes. Although the Kyoto Protocol implemented emissions trading as a means <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>emissions</b> at national levels, the global nature of air transport means that all air travel is excluded from this mechanism. The government is seeking to redress this through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which has been working on the environmental issue since 1998, but progress is slow. In the meantime efforts are being made to include aviation in the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) with an original target to implement this by 2008. In 2006 the government re-affirmed this policy as the best approach for addressing the climate change impacts of aviation, and current proposals aim at accomplishing this for all flights within the EU by 2011, with the scheme being extended to include all flights to and from the EU the following year.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in <b>reducing</b> carbon <b>emissions</b> related <b>to</b> concrete from both the academic and industrial sectors, especially {{with the possibility of}} future carbon tax implementation. Several approaches <b>to</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>emissions</b> have been suggested.|$|R
5000|$|... 10 January 2007: The European Commission {{presented}} {{a series of}} proposals setting ambitious targets of greenhouse gases reduction. It announced the EU would commit itself <b>to</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>emissions</b> of developed countries by 30% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2020 in international negotiations. In addition, the Commission planned its commitment <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> its domestic <b>emissions</b> by at least 20% by 2020.|$|R

25|$|With {{the long}} term aim of cutting overall {{emissions}} by 60% by 2050, and by 80% by 2100, {{the intention of the}} 2006 changes was to cut energy use in new housing by 20% compared to a similar building constructed to the 2002 standards. The changes were the first to the regulations brought about by the desire <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>emissions,</b> though some have raised doubts about whether they will actually achieve the 20% cut (see criticisms section).|$|E
25|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{is an international}} public good, and GHG emissions are an international externality (Goldemberg et al., 1996:21,28,43). A change {{in the quality of}} the atmosphere does not affect the welfare of all individuals equally. In other words, some individuals may benefit from climate change, while others may lose out. This uneven distribution of potential climate change impacts, plus the uneven distribution of emissions globally, make it difficult to secure a global agreement <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>emissions</b> (Halsnæs et al., 2007:127).|$|E
25|$|Governments {{have taken}} action to reduce GHG {{emissions}} (climate change mitigation).
