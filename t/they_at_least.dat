5|$|Clement criticizes Greek paganism in the Protrepticus on {{the basis}} that its deities are both false and poor moral examples, and he attacks the mystery {{religions}} for their obscurantism and trivial rituals. In particular, the worshippers of Dionysus are ridiculed for their ritual use of children's toys. He suggests at some points that the pagan deities are based on humans, but at others that they are misanthropic demons, and he cites several classical sources in support of this second hypothesis. Clement, like many pre-Nicene fathers, writes favourably about Euhemerus and other rationalist philosophers, on the grounds that <b>they</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> saw the flaws in paganism. However, his greatest praise is reserved for Plato, whose apophatic views of God prefigure Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Now {{that he was}} a reservist, Matsui {{had more}} time to pursue his pan-Asian project. Between October and December 1935 he toured the major cities of China and Manchukuo {{speaking}} to Chinese politicians and businessmen about pan-Asianism and setting up a new branch of the Greater Asia Association in Tianjin. Upon his return to Japan in December 1935 he became President of the Greater Asia Association. In February and March 1936, amid ongoing tension with China, Matsui made a second trip to China, this time on a government-sponsored goodwill tour. Matsui met personally with Chiang, and though he found little common ground with him, <b>they</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> were united in their anti-communism. Matsui came out of the meeting believing that joint anti-communism could be the basis for Sino-Japanese cooperation in the future. Then in December 1936, following the Xi'an Incident, Chiang agreed to join with the Communist Party of China to resist Japan, a move that Matsui viewed as a personal betrayal.|$|E

25|$|The Associated Press reports, {{based on}} {{interviews}} in California and Egypt, that trafficking of children for domestic labor in the U.S. includes an extension of an illegal but common practice in Africa. Families in remote villages send their daughters to work in cities for extra money {{and the opportunity to}} escape a dead-end life. Some girls work for free on the understanding that <b>they</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> will be better fed in the home of their employer. This custom has led to the spread of trafficking, as well-to-do Africans accustomed to employing children immigrate into the U.S.|$|E
25|$|According to the Train's log, 30 September was {{a special}} day. It was the second {{day in a row}} that the base had not been shelled by Turkish artillery. Of course, they would make up for the {{oversight}} on 1 October, but for the sailors it was a welcome reprieve. While the Train wasn't itself involved in actual fighting, it was constantly shelled and bombed by Turkish forces. It was a common sight at Suvla to see 40 British soldiers under the direction of a RAN Petty Officer, working to bring supplies ashore during rough weather. The soldiers would openly look forward to returning to their trenches where <b>they</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> had the ability to shoot back at anyone who attacked them.|$|E
25|$|In August 2002, the Cherokee Nation {{conducted}} a survey of 115,026 Cherokee citizens who live within the 14 counties of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. Their aim was to evaluate {{the status of the}} language. Of those surveyed, 91% reported that <b>they</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> heard the language being used in the public domain; 18% heard the language used in hospitals, 14% reported hearing it at church, 12% used/heard the language at home, 9% heard it in stores, 8% heard it at work, 7% heard it at school, 7% heard it on grounds, 6% heard it in courts, and 8% heard it in other settings. In the home, Cherokee was only used by 17% of survey respondents; the overwhelming majority spoke only English in the home setting. 18% of the surveyed persons spoke Cherokee as a first language, and 5% had learned Cherokee and English jointly as primary languages. At the beginning of the 20th century, 75% of Cherokee citizens are believed to have been raised bilingually in Cherokee and English. Today, only about 5% or less are raised in Cherokee-speaking homes. Many speakers, perhaps the majority, are over fifty years of age. Another 2002 survey indicated that the Cherokee language was very close to extinction, as few people younger than the grandparental generation were found who were fluent in the language. Usually, older adults are the final speakers of a language. If they do not pass it along to their descendants, the language will be lost. Thus, the 2002 estimate for the lifespan of the language was only about 30–40 years. The Cherokee language in North Carolina was found to be particularly imperiled, with perhaps fewer than 1,000 remaining speakers and elderly speakers dying off far more quickly than new speakers were emerging. From such surveys the Cherokee Nation also learned that most of its members believed preservation of Cherokee culture and language for future generations is essential.|$|E

25|$|From {{the start}} of the war the Dutch {{priority}} had been to secure their Barrier fortress system as stipulated – though unspecified – in the Grand Alliance treaty; they also had concerns on their eastern German border (from Cleves in the south to East Frisia in the north) where their once political and economical dominance had come under threat from the Prussians. In consequence, Spain had become largely irrelevant to the States General, and they had increasingly looked favourably on a deal with France based on partition of the Spanish inheritance between Archduke Charles and the Duke of Anjou. As early as 1705 Louis XIV had approached the Allies with peace feelers, attempting to split the Dutch from the Alliance and achieve a partition of Spain. The defeat at Ramillies in 1706, and the defeat at Oudenarde and loss of Lille in 1708, had further encouraged Louis XIV to abandon the principle of Spanish integrity. Yet for dynastic and strategic reasons Joseph I and his ministers in Vienna were unwilling to grant Philip V compensation in Italy, while Charles III in Barcelona, after years of struggle, sincerely believed in his rightful claims to the whole of Spain and its dependencies. The British supported the Habsburgs in opposing partition, in part to protect their Mediterranean trade: they were already pressing for the cessation of Menorca and the strategically important Port Mahón for themselves, and they were determined to prevent the Duke of Anjou acquiring Sicily and Naples, thereby limiting French maritime influence in the region. In desperation, therefore, Louis XIV sent the president of the Parlement of Paris, Pierre Rouillé, to meet with Dutch ministers in March 1709 at Moerdijk, confident that <b>they</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> were willing to accept some token partition. However, British and Austrian intransigence, and a whole raft of conditions from their allies, scuppered any chance of a compromise. The Dutch, unwilling to treat without British support, were compelled once again to put their faith in the strength of the Grand Alliance.|$|E
500|$|The Memphis {{commercial}} {{convention of}} 1849 {{recommended that the}} United States pursue the trans-isthmus route, since it appeared unlikely that a transcontinental railroad would be built anytime soon. Interests in Louisiana were especially adamant about this option, as they believed that any transcontinental railroad would divert commercial traffic away from the Mississippi and New Orleans, and <b>they</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> wanted to secure a southern route. Also showing interest was Peter A. Hargous of New York who ran an import-export business between New York and Vera Cruz. Hargous purchased {{the rights to the}} route for $25,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ), but realized that the grant had little value unless it was supported by the Mexican and American governments.|$|E
500|$|After the war, Turner {{was cast}} in a lead part in The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946) {{opposite}} John Garfield, a film noir based on James M. Cain's debut novel of the same name. Turner reportedly did not get along with Garfield on the set; according to one documentary, when she found he was her male lead, she responded: [...] "Couldn't <b>they</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> hire someone attractive?" [...] The now-classic film noir marked {{a turning point in}} Turner's career as her first femme fatale role. Reviews of the film, and in particular, Turner's performance, were glowing, with a critic of The New York Times writing it was [...] "the role of her career."

500|$|It is {{possible}} that the marriage with Elisiv had been agreed to already during Harald's first time in Rus', or that <b>they</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> had been acquainted. During his service in the Byzantine Empire, Harald composed a love poem which included the verse [...] "Yet the goddess in Russia/ will not accept my gold rings" [...] (whom Snorri Sturluson identifies with Elisiv), although Morkinskinna claims that Harald had to remind Yaroslav of the promised marriage when he returned to Kiev. According to the same source, Harald had spoken with Yaroslav during his first time in Rus', requesting to marry Elisiv, only to be rejected because he was not yet wealthy enough. It is in any case significant that Harald was allowed to marry the daughter of Yaroslav, since his other children were married to figures such as Henry I of France, Andrew I of Hungary and the daughter of Constantine IX.|$|E
2500|$|In 1905 New Zealand {{made their}} first tour of Britain.

2500|$|Under Article 28.3.3° the Constitution grants {{the state}} {{sweeping}} powers [...] "in {{time of war}} or armed rebellion", which may (if so resolved by both Houses of the Oireachtas) include an armed conflict {{in which the state}} is not a direct participant. During a national emergency the Oireachtas may pass laws that would otherwise be unconstitutional, and the actions of the executive cannot be found to be ultra vires or unconstitutional provided <b>they</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> [...] "purport" [...] to be in pursuance of such a law.

2500|$|The {{sources of}} De Almeida's {{knowledge}} are not spelled out, but <b>they</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> reflect contemporary views. His comments regarding the Hebrew {{knowledge of the}} Beta Israel of that time is very significant: {{it could not have}} come from recent intercourse with Jews elsewhere, so it indicates deep antiquity to Beta Israel traditions, at least at that time, before their literature was taken away from them and demolished by the later conquering Christians. (The more sceptical school of historians, whose views are discussed above, deny that the Ethiopian Jews ever knew Hebrew; they certainly have no Hebrew texts remaining, and have been forced in recent centuries to use the Christian [...] "Old Testament" [...] in Ge'ez after their own literature was destroyed.) It is also of interest that he mentions more Jewish communities dwelling beyond Ethiopia in the Sudan. [...] As so often in such medieval hearsay accounts, however, loose claims are made that may not be accurate. [...] The Beta Israel were not predominantly of the Arabic race, for instance, but he may have meant the term loosely or meant that they also knew Arabic.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the months}} and years after Kraft's {{purchase}} of the Patriots, relations between Kraft and Parcells were increasingly strained. This was primarily due to a struggle over Parcells' authority over football operations. [...] Kraft wanted Parcells to yield some of his authority over personnel moves to a separate general manager. Parcells had effectively been the Patriots' general manager as well since his arrival, and {{was not interested in}} yielding authority that he had been granted over personnel when he was hired. [...] He famously complained that [...] "if they're gonna let you cook the dinner, <b>they</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> ought to let you shop for some of the groceries." [...] The conflict climaxed {{in the days leading up}} to the Super Bowl, with rampant rumors that Parcells would leave the Patriots after the season to take the vacant head coaching job with the New York Jets. Despite these distractions, the Patriots played the Packers close for much of the game, and actually took the lead briefly in the 2nd quarter. However, two long Brett Favre touchdown passes and a Super Bowl record 99-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by MVP Desmond Howard sealed New England's fate, with the Packers winning their 12th title, and third of the Super Bowl era, 35–21.|$|E
2500|$|When it debuted, Fallen Angels {{received}} mixed {{to critical}} notices. In his review for the Associated Press, Scott Williams wrote, 'We're {{asking a lot}} of TV to deliver entertainment about that stylish, moral abyss. Fallen Angels delivers. It lets us look over the edge and measure our souls against the darkness". The Chicago Sun-Times gave the series two out of four stars and Ginny Holbert wrote, [...] "Part {{of the problem is}} the series' arch, self-conscious obsession with style. Instead of a '90s interpretation of film noir, [...] "Fallen Angels" [...] offers contrived, full-color cliche noir, replete with cocked fedoras, plumes of curling smoke and harsh sunlight sliced by venetian blinds". In his review for The New York Times, John J. O'Connor called it, [...] "uneven but diverting, even when just hovering around film-school level". In his review for the Houston Chronicle, Louis B. Parks wrote, [...] "The big problem with film noir homages is they usually overdo the ingredients, with none of the subtlety of the great originals. Fallen Angels has a touch of that. But the directors and actors play straight, and the adaptations, taken from the real McCoy writers, are pretty good stuff". In his review for the Washington Post, Tom Shales wrote, [...] "Creating period pieces out of their period seems to be fairly easy now for the gifted artisans of Hollywood. Even by today's commonplace high standards, however, {{the look and feel of}} the six Fallen Angels films seem transportingly authentic and sensuous, stylized in ways that evoke the milieu without spoofing it. Occasionally, the films veer into the arch and ridiculous, but overall, <b>they</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> look darn good". Newsweek magazine's David Gates wrote, [...] "no show this summer will do a better job of whisking you away from the increasingly unacceptable '90s. These half hours are all too short". Entertainment Weekly magazine's Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, [...] "One unintended result of all this happy, naughty cigarette-puffing, however, is that, at their weakest, these films look like the work of boys (and don't be fooled, this is a boys' fantasy production) dressed up in their dads' big suits".|$|E
