40|$|A review {{some basic}} {{parasite}} diseases in fish: flagellids, dinoflagellides and ichthyophthriasis in African fish {{was carried out}} to educate fish culturist {{and the private sector}} on some challenges faced in culture fisheries. Some common parasite diseases: Ichtyobodiasis, Coccidiosis, Ichtyopthiariasis, <b>Trichodiniasis,</b> Heminthiasis, Crustacean parasite, Hirudinea infestation, Flagellates and Ciliates, Taxonomy and diagnosis, Life cycle and biology, Epizootiology, pathology, control, Infections with parasite dinoflagellids and Ichthyophthiriasis are some parasite infections in fish discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Trichodiniasis</b> {{was noted}} in an {{intensive}} milkfish (Chanos chanos) nursery pond in Dumangas, Iloilo, Philippines. It was predominantly {{caused by a}} small trichodinid species (body diameter= 23 - 29 Âµm) with well-developed denticles, identified as Paratrichodina sp. The trichodinid infection resulted in proliferative changes, including clubbing and epithelial hyperplasis of the gill lamellae sufficient to disrupt respiratory function. Tolerance tests of milkfish fingerlings in an earthen pond-simulated environment resulted in a 24 h TL 90 value of 1. 98 Â± 0. 25 ppm KMnO 4. A treatment of 1. 0 ppm KMnO 4 was highly efficacious (96 %) in eliminating trichodinids on gills with minimal mortality of treated milkfish observed 24 hours post-treatment...|$|E
40|$|Water {{quality has}} infuence {{on the health}} status of the organisms living in it. In the {{available}} literature, {{there is only a}} few reports on the health status of chub, particularly in the Sava river. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate health status of chub as indicator of water quality. Furthermore we aimed at relating fish histology and parasitology to the number of bacteria in the water. We sampled 289 chubs for parasitological and histological examination. Fish were sampled on five sites from slovenian–croatian border through to the inflow of river Una in Sava. At the same time, water was sampled for the counting of coliforms and heterotrophic bacteria. The difference in the number of bacteria in the water was pronounced at different locations, with Oborovo and Otok Samoborski having the highest and the lowest values respectively. The intensity of histological parameters was in correlation with the number of bacteria in water. At least one histological parameter highly correlating with the water quality was found in every organ. Regarding parasite invasions, only ichthyophthiriasis and <b>trichodiniasis</b> showed high negative correlation with microbiological quality of the water. As part of parasitological examination, molecular methods were used for the identification of Acanthocephala...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{changes in}} some blood serum {{components}} of Clarias gariepinus due to exposure to Benzo-a-pyrene and infection with the external parasite Trichodina were studied. Total blood serum protein, serum albumin and globulin concentrations were significantly (P# 0. 05) decreased in C. gariepinus exposed to benzo-a-pyrene and in Trichodina infected fish. Albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio in C. gariepinus was neither significantly affected {{due to the}} exposure to benzo-a-pyrene nor by <b>Trichodiniasis.</b> Blood serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzymes activities, creatinine, urea and uric acid values were significantly (P# 0. 05) elevated in the benzo-a-pyrene exposed fish {{as well as in}} the diseased fish. Trichodina infection together with the benzo-a-pyrene exposure led to more prominent significant important (P# 0. 05) decrease in the fish total blood serum protein, serum albumin and globulin concentrations and revealed drastic increase in serum AST and ALT enzymes activities as well as creatinine, urea and uric acid values. Pollution due to exposure to benzo-a- pyrene adversely affects the physiological and immunological status of catfish Claris gariepinus leading to increased susceptibility to infection with trichodina species. In conclusion, infection with Trichodina in fish exposed to pollution of benzo-a-pyrene had the highest drastic effect on the health of fish. Key words: Benzo-a-pyrene % Trichodina % Clarias gariepinus % AST % ALT % Albumin % Globuli...|$|E
