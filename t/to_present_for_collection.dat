Lifelogging devices, such as the wearable camera known as SenseCam, can record thousands of images per day. Utilizing the approach of event segmentation <b>to</b> organize and <b>present</b> these images, we have designed an interface <b>to</b> <b>present</b> lifelog <b>collections</b> <b>for</b> touchscreen interaction, thus increasing accessibility for users...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative data {{such as the}} type, quantity, and {{bulk density}} as {{received}} and after in situ compaction, are required for the proper management of a landfill site. Without quantitative data we cannot determine for example whether too much cover material is used, with the resultant shortening {{of the life of}} the landfill site. Such data are also required for planning of the use of the existing site, and also for the acquisition of future sites or the use of alternative waste treatment processes. An estimate of the growth of the rate of waste generation is also required for planning purposes. The estimate should be based on data collected over a period of time supplemented by information on anticipated changes in factors such as housing and other building development in the area served by the landfill site. It may be argued that information is already available on the per-capita waste generation in major cities in the world (e. g. refs. l to 4) and also in a number of cities in Australia (e. g. refs. 5 to 10). The per-capita waste generation has been found, however, to vary from city to city. This is not surprising, since it is expected that waste generation is affected by the standard of living of the population, the type of housing, development activities, and many other factors that may be peculiar to the locality. On-site surveys are therefore required to obtain data for particular localities, and the recognition of the importance of such surveys is indicated by the increasing number of survey results being reported in the literature (e. g. ref. 2, 4). The aim of this paper is <b>to</b> <b>present</b> methods <b>for</b> data <b>collection</b> required <b>for</b> the proper and effective management of landfill sites. The methods range from a simple survey involving field weighing and vehicle count, to a comprehensive survey that takes into account the physical and chemical composition of the waste. It has to be borne in mind that the method selected should depend upon the objective to be achieved. If the objective of the survey is the estimation of the life of a landfill site then a simple field weighing survey is what is required, on the other hand if incineration is to be considered as an alternative waste treatment process then a more comprehensive survey needs to be carried out to include at least the calorific value of the waste and the properties of ash formed...|$|R
