5|$|Freshmen were {{expected}} to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth. For almost two decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912. In 1935, a farmer reported that students carried off his entire barn as fuel for Bonfire. To prevent future incidents, the university made Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them toward a grove of dead <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> the edge of town.|$|E
50|$|A 1-dimensional range <b>tree</b> <b>on</b> {{a set of}} n {{points is}} a binary search tree, which can be {{constructed}} in O(n log n) time. Range trees in higher dimensions are constructed recursively by constructing a balanced binary search <b>tree</b> <b>on</b> the first coordinate of the points, and then, for each vertex v in this tree, constructing a (d−1)-dimensional range <b>tree</b> <b>on</b> the points contained in the subtree of v. Constructing a range tree this way would require O(n logdn) time.|$|R

5|$|In May 2000, twenty {{trees were}} planted, {{one for each}} boys who attended.

5|$|Most {{severely}} damaged was the agricultural industry. The worst loss in agriculture was from bananas and coconuts, of which about 75 {{percent of the}} crop was destroyed. Banana fields were completely destroyed, and in the southern portion of the island most coconut trees were blown down. Citrus trees fared better, due to the small yet sturdy nature of the trees. In addition, David's winds uprooted many <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> the tops of mountains, leaving them bare and damaging the ecosystem by disrupting the water levels.|$|E

5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey is arboreal and diurnal, and most often {{moves through the}} <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> four legs (quadrupedal locomotion). It lives in groups containing several adult males, adult females and juveniles. The group size tends to be smaller than that of South American {{squirrel monkey}}s, but is still larger than for many other New World monkey species. The group generally numbers between 20 and 75 monkeys, {{with a mean of}} 41 monkeys. Groups in excess of 100 sometimes occur, but these are believed to be temporary mergers of two groups. On average, groups contain about 60% more females than males.|$|E
