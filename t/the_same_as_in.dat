5|$|According to the anti-nuclear movement, {{most of the}} {{problems}} with nuclear power today are much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s. Nuclear reactor accidents still occur and there is no convincing {{solution to the problem of}} long-lived radioactive waste. Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur, notably in Pakistan and North Korea, building on facilities and expertise from civilian nuclear operations. The alternatives to nuclear power, efficient energy use and renewable energy (especially wind power), have been further developed and commercialised.|$|E
5|$|Ace Attorney Investigations 2 is an {{adventure}} {{game in which}} players control prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, who investigates five cases; {{in one of the}} cases, the player also controls Edgeworth's father Gregory. The gameplay is mostly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the previous game, , and is divided into two types of phases: investigations and rebuttals.|$|E
5|$|For the 20th {{anniversary of}} Final Fantasy, Square Enix remade Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II for the PlayStation Portable. The games were {{released}} in Japan and North America in 2007, and in European territories in 2008. The PSP version features higher-resolution 2D graphics, full motion video sequences, a remixed soundtrack, {{and a new}} dungeon {{as well as the}} bonus dungeons from Dawn of Souls. The script is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the Dawn of Souls version, aside from the new dungeon.|$|E

5|$|In France, at some {{stage the}} apothecaries' pound of 12ounces was {{replaced}} by the larger civil pound of 16ounces.

5|$|The basic {{equipment}} of a 4th-century foot soldier was essentially <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the 2nd century: metal armour cuirass, metal helmet, shield and sword. Some evolution {{took place during}} the 3rd century. Trends included the adoption of warmer clothing; the disappearance of distinctive legionary armour and weapons; the adoption by the infantry of equipment used by the cavalry in the earlier period; and the greater use of heavily armoured cavalry called cataphracts.|$|E
5|$|The cast mostly {{remained}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> season one; Matt Hill, Samuel Vincent, and Tony Sampson {{were cast}} as Ed, Double Dee, and Eddy, David Paul Grove as Jonny 2x4, Keenan Christenson as Jimmy, Janyse Jaud as Sarah and Lee Kanker, Kathleen Barr as Kevin and Marie, Peter Kelamis as Rolf, and Erin Fitzgerald as May Kanker, but Tabitha St. Germain, {{the voice of}} Nazz, was replaced by Fitzgerald.|$|E

5|$|The chamber version {{replaces the}} brass mostly by the organ and uses only one each of flute, oboe, {{clarinet}} and horn. Timpani, percussion and harp are <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the orchestra version, {{and for the}} strings, {{a minimum of two}} first violins, two second violins, two violas, one cello and one double bass required.|$|E
5|$|The series {{moved back}} to once-weekly Saturday broadcasts. All episodes were 45 minutes long, though they also exist in 25-minute versions. Although there were now only 13 episodes in the season, the total running time {{remained}} approximately <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> previous seasons since the episodes were almost twice as long.|$|E
5|$|Third ending: The narrator re-appears {{outside the}} house at 16 Cheyne Walk and turns back his pocket watch by fifteen minutes. Events are <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the second-ending version until Charles meets Sarah, when their reunion is sour. The new ending does not make clear the {{parentage}} {{of the child and}} Sarah expresses no interest in reviving the relationship. Charles leaves the house, intending to return to the United States, wondering whether Sarah is a manipulative, lying woman who exploited him.|$|E

5|$|While {{technology}} increases {{demand for}} entertainment products and offers increased speed of delivery, the forms {{that make up}} the content are in themselves, relatively stable.

5|$|A new {{electoral system}} of two-round voting had been {{introduced}} for the 2004 regional elections, in part {{in an attempt to}} reduce the FN's influence in regional councils. The FN won 15.1% of the vote in metropolitan France, almost <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> 1998, but its number of councillors was almost halved due to the new electoral system. For the 2004 European elections too, a new system less favourable to the FN {{had been introduced}}. The party regained some of its strength from 1999, earning 9.8% of the vote and seven seats.|$|E
5|$|Along the way, {{the story}} was greatly {{modified}} {{to make it more}} suitable as a family film. By the time it was completed in 1981, the film had changed into a chronicle of the unlikely friendship of two creatures, who should be natural enemies and who learn society sometimes tries to determine their roles despite their better impulses. In the original screenplay, Chief was slated to die <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the novel, but Stevens did not want to have an on-screen death and modified the film so that he survived.|$|E

5|$|As regards numbers, the mid-2nd-century army {{contained}} c. 80,000 cavalry out of c. 385,000 total effectives i.e. cavalry constituted c. 21% of {{the total}} forces. For the late army, about {{one third of the}} army units in the Notitia are cavalry, but in numbers cavalry were a smaller proportion {{of the total}} because cavalry units were on average smaller than infantry units. For example, in the comitatus, cavalry vexillationes were probably half the size of infantry legiones. Overall, the available evidence suggests that the proportion of cavalry was much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the 2nd century. Examples: in 478, a comitatus of 38,000 men contained 8,000 cavalry (21%). In 357, the comitatus of Gaul, 13–15,000 strong, contained an estimated 3,000 cavalry (20–23%).|$|E
5|$|Below centurion/decurion rank, junior {{officers}} in the Roman army were known as principales. An auxiliary cohort's ranks appear <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> a legionary centuria. These were, in ascending order: tesserarius ("officer of the watch"), signifer (standard-bearer for the centuria), optio (centurion's deputy) and vexillarius (standard-bearer for the whole regiment, from vexillum). In the turmae of cohortes equitatae (and of alae?), the decurion's second-in-command was probably known as a curator, responsible for horses and caparison. As in the legions, the principales, together with some regimental specialists, were classified in two pay-scales: sesquiplicarii ("one-and-a-half-pay men") and duplicarii ("double-pay men"). These ranks are probably most closely resembled by the modern ranks of corporal and sergeant respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, the Marvell Press {{published}} Listen presents Philip Larkin reading The Less Deceived (Listen LPV1), an LP {{record on}} which Larkin recites all the poems from The Less Deceived {{in the order}} they appear in the printed volume. This was followed, in 1965, by Philip Larkin reads and comments on The Whitsun Weddings (Listen LPV6), again on the Marvell Press's record label (though the printed volume was published by Faber and Faber). Once again the poems are read in {{the order in which}} they appear in the printed volume, but with Larkin including introductory remarks to many of the poems. A recording of Larkin reading the poems from his final collection, High Windows, was published in 1975 as British poets of our time. Philip Larkin; High Windows: poems read by the author (edited by Peter Orr) on the Argo record label (Argo PLP 1202). As with the two previous recordings, the sequencing of the poems is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the printed volume.|$|E

5|$|In {{view of the}} board's lack of urgency, C {{took nearly}} a year to {{research}} this project. The proposed main battery of eight 14-inch guns was kept constant while other factors were calculated—speeds of 26, 29 and 32 knots; operating ranges of 5000, 7000 and 8000 miles; and belt armor of 8, 11 and 14 inches. On 12 July 1912, Naval Constructor R.H. Robinson presented these studies at a lecture he gave at the Naval War College with the General Board in attendance. There, he emphasized 8 inches as an absolute minimum for armor protection and recommended a radius of 8000 miles, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> U.S. battleships. The General Board's reaction was to request two battlecruisers for the 1914 Naval Building Program and ask C for a slightly {{modified version of the}} proposed ship, but the Naval War College felt the design had serious problems and that a fast battleship would be a more practical option.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1910, {{the design}} board chose the 30.5cm, to be mounted in four twin turrets on the {{centerline}} of the ship. The armor layout was kept <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> Seydlitz. In the meantime, pressure from the British public and media had forced the British Parliament to step up ship building. Kaiser Wilhelm II requested that the build time for the new battlecruisers be reduced to two years each, as opposed to three years. This proved unfeasible, because neither the armor or armament firms could supply the necessary materials according to an expedited schedule.|$|E
5|$|One {{reviewer}} {{criticized the}} decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30percent its original speed. The notebook was also noted for running hot. Users complained that upgrading system memory was harder than in older Apple notebooks. Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the new models. Some users noted a slight flickering when the screen was on lower brightness settings. Apple increased the battery capacity by 10 Wh, going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60, but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more power. Battery life therefore remained about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> previous models, at three-plus hours.|$|E
