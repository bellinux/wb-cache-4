50|$|In {{the past}} decade, the Arctic region has faced {{some of its}} highest {{temperatures}} within the instrumental record. Furthermore, within the past 2000 years, summer temperature highs have never been harsher, based on paleo-climate reconstructions. This warming is due to climate feedbacks mechanisms based on sea-ice melt. As sea ice melts, it frees up more open ocean water to be further heated, thus bringing about a positive feedback. Ocean water retains more heat than sea ice; additionally the albedo of sea ice {{is much higher than}} that of ocean water. Ringed seals require sea ice to live and reproduce. They live most of their lives alone, only grouping together into colonies when they are on sea ice to molt, mate, or rest. Without access to sea ice, ringed seals are unable to sustain life, which further affects trophic levels both above and below. Ringed seals are both predators and prey. A predator to zooplankton and fish, the ringed seal is considered a primary consumer as well as a secondary consumer. But the <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumer,</b> or top predator, in the Arctic is the polar bear, feeding mostly on seals, including the ringed seal. Yet through further exploration, the potential fates of this Arctic food web seem to be ambiguous, leading to a very important trade off of polar bear mortality and ringed seal sustenance.|$|E

Samples of water, algal cells, macrophytes, shrimps and fish were taken to detect MCs by HPLC-MS/MS after solid phase extraction. Widespread MC contamination in water, algal cells, macrophytes, shrimps and fish was found in Lake Taihu. The ubiquitous presence of MCs in water, algal cells and biota was found in 100 % of samples. MC accumulation was in the order of primary producer > <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumer</b> > secondary consumer > primary consumer. The highest levels of MCs in macrophytes, shrimps and fish tissue were found in Potamogeton maackianus, Exopalaemon modestus, and Hyporhamphus intermedius, respectively.

Ceratophyllum demersum L. was an ideal plant for introduction into lakes to protect against Microcystis blooms and MCs, due to its ability to absorb nutrients, accumulate large amounts of MCs and tolerate these toxins compared to other macrophytes. The average daily intakes (ADIs) of MCs for Exopalaemon modestus and three fish species, Coilia ectenes, Hyporhamphus intermedius and Carassius carassius, were all above the tolerable daily intakes (TDI) set by the World Health Organization (WHO), implying there existed potential threats to human health...|$|E

40|$|Assessment of isotopic {{compositions}} at {{the base}} of food webs is a prerequisite for using stable isotope analysis to assess foraging locations and trophic positions of marine organisms. Our study represents a unique application of stable-isotope analyses across multiple trophic levels (primary producer, primary consumer and <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumer)</b> and over a large spatial scale in two pelagic marine ecosystems. We found that delta N- 15 values of particulate organic matter (POM), barnacles and phenylalanine from the muscle tissue of yellowfin tuna all showed similar spatial patterns. This consistency suggests that isotopic analysis of any of these can provide a reasonable proxy for isotopic variability {{at the base}} of the food web. Secondly, variations in the delta N- 15 values of yellowfin tuna bulk-muscle tissues paralleled the spatial trends observed in all of these isotopic baseline proxies. Variation in isotopic composition {{at the base of}} the food web, rather than differences in tuna diet, explained the 11 parts per thousand variability observed in the bulk-tissue delta N- 15 values of yellowfin tuna. Evaluating the trophic position of yellowfin tuna using amino-acid isotopic compositions across the western Indian and equatorial Pacific Oceans strongly suggests these tuna occupy similar trophic positions, albeit absolute trophic positions estimated by this method were lower than expected. This study reinforces the importance of considering isotopic baseline variability for diet studies, and provides new insights into methods that can be applied to generate nitrogen isoscapes for worldwide comparisons of top predators in marine ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} larger (> 1000 µm) size {{fraction}} of zooplankton in an Arctic coastal water community in Billefjorden, Svalbard (78 ° 40 ’ N), Norway, {{in order to}} describe seasonal vertical distributions of the dominant taxa in relation to environmental variability. Calanus spp. numerically dominated the herbivores; Aglantha digitale, Mertensia ovum, Beroë cucumis, and Parasagitta elegans were the dominant carnivores. Omnivores and detritivores were numerically less important. Descent to deeper regions of the water column (> 100 m) between August and October, and ascent to the shallower region (< 100 m) between November and May was the overall seasonal pattern in this zooplankton community. In contrast to other groups, P. elegans did not exhibit pronounced vertical migrations. Seasonal vertical distributions of most species showed statistical associations with the availability of their main food source. The vertical distribution of later developmental stages of Calanus spp. was inversely associated with fluorescence, indicating that they descended from the shallower region {{while it was still}} relatively productive, and ascended before the primary production had started to increase. Strong associations between the vertical distributions of secondary consumer M. ovum and Calanus spp., and <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumer</b> B. cucumis and M. ovum indicated that these carnivores seasonally followed their prey through the water column. We conclude that seasonal vertical migrations are a widespread trait in the high Arctic community studied, and predator−prey interactions seem particularly central in shaping the associations between the seasonal vertical strategies of adjacent trophic levels...|$|E

Depleted carbon signatures (from _ 24. 7 & to _ 17. 8 &) were found in freshwater, whereas more enriched signatures (from _ 19. 1 & to _ 12. 3 &) were obtained within the estuarine zone downstream. Based on our survey of the C 3 and C 4 plants and isotopic values for phytoplankton and benthic microalgae reported for ecosystems elsewhere, we hypothesized that the observed d 13 C differences in the fish assemblage between freshwater and estuarine sites {{is due to a}} shift from assimilating organic matter ultimately derived from C 3 freshwater marsh vegetation and phytoplankton at the freshwater site (d 13 C ranging from _ 25 & to _ 19 &), to C 4 salt-marsh (e. g.

The {{present study is}} unique in that it not only included invertebrates (seven species) and fish (six species) but also an amphibian (one species), reptiles (three species), and mammals (three species). Nonfish vertebrates such as those included {{in the present study}} are often not included in assessments of trophic transfer of Hg. Mean trophic position (determined using stable isotopes of nitrogen) ranged from 2. 0 (indicative of a primary consumer) to 3. 8 (indicative of a <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumer).</b> Mean total Hg concentrations ranged from 36 to 3, 292 ng/g dry weight in muscle and whole body and from 150 to 30, 171 ng/g dry weight in liver. Most of the Hg in muscle and whole-body tissue was found as methylmercury, and at least 50 % of the Hg found in liver was in the inorganic form (with the exception of largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides). Mercury concentrations were positively correlated with trophic position, indicating that biomagnification occurs in the food web of Caddo Lake. The food web magnification factors (FWMFs; slope of the relationship between mean Hg concentration and trophic position) for both total Hg andmethylmercury were similar to those observed in other studies. Because most of the total Hg in consumers was methylmercury, the FWMF for methylmercury was not significantly different from the FWMF for total Hg.

Decapod crustaceans (31. 71 ± 3. 92 %) and teleost fishes (16. 45 ± 3. 43 %) made the largest contribution to the standardised diet of the Myliobatoidei. Teleost fishes (37. 40 ± 16. 09 %) and polychaete worms (31. 96 ± 14. 22 %) were the most prominent prey categories in the standardised diet of the suborder Torpedinoidei. Cluster analysis identified nine major trophic guilds the largest of which were decapod crustaceans (24 species), teleost fishes (11 species) and molluscs (11 species). Trophic level estimates for rays ranged from 3. 10 for Potamotrygon falkneri to 4. 24 for Gymnura australis, Torpedo marmorata and T. nobiliana. Secondary consumers with a T L < 4. 00 represented 84 % of the species examined, with the remaining 12 species (16 %) classified as <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers</b> (T L ≥ 4. 00). <b>Tertiary</b> <b>consumers</b> included electric rays (Torpedo, 3 spp. and Hypnos, 1 sp.), butterfly rays (Gymnura, 4 spp.), stingrays (2 spp.) and Potamotrygonid stingrays (2 spp.).

50|$|Predators {{are often}} another organism's prey, and {{likewise}} prey are often predators. Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes {{may be the}} prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, {{but there are also}} <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers</b> eating these carnivores, quaternary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which in turn eat grasses). A predator at the top of any food chain is called an apex predator; examples include the sperm whale, Komodo dragon, tiger, and most eagles and owls. Many predators eat from multiple levels of the food chain. A carnivore may eat both secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers,</b> and its prey may itself be difficult to classify for similar reasons. Organisms showing both carnivory and herbivory are known as omnivores. Even herbivores such as the giant panda may supplement their diet with meat.|$|R

40|$|Arthropods {{are a major}} {{component}} of the marine zooplankton, functioning as intermediates between primary producers and <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers</b> in pelagic food webs. They have likely occupied the water column ecospace since the early Cambrian, co-evolving with several major plankton groups through the Phanerozoic. Analysis of the fossil record of arthropods indicates that a zooplanktonic lifestyle has arisen independently across several arthropod groups, and that the arthropod body plan has shown adaptability to fundamental environmental change. Key anatomical adaptations and reproductive strategies that are compatible with and/or facilitate a zooplanktonic lifestyle include well-developed swimming appendages, buoyancy, an active metabolism supported by efficient respiration, visual or photoreception organs for use in detecting mates, food and predators, and the nurturing of young within the exoskeleton. Many of these characters are apparent in the earliest record of arthropods. The development and diversification of arthropod zooplankton into the food chain helped enable large secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers</b> to enter the water column and also contributed to the export of organic matter to the seabed via the faecal stream. Although the fossil record of arthropod zooplankton is extremely poor for most of the Phanerozoic, their position in marine food webs suggests they have been fundamental to rebuilding marine trophic structure following major extinction events, and to maintaining marine plankton diversity through Phanerozoic time.

Station B was typically located within the Florida Current showing great influence from the current’s physical factors. The current, acted as a physical barrier, entrapping species at near shore stations, increasing population densities by increased nutrient loads through upwelling and land runoff. The movement of the current inshore showed a greater resurgence of oceanic species at each station. However, {{the western edge of the}} current, acting as a barrier, yielded the lowest population densities overall and among all copepod orders. The decrease can influence food web dynamics and the prey availability to higher <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers.</b> Population dynamics were ascertained by relative copepod densities identified to the lowest possible taxa and enumerated.
