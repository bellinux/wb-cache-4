5|$|As Representative Mark Larson {{neared the}} end of his term-limited tenure in the Colorado House of Representatives, Roberts began to work with him on {{learning}} the legislative process, in preparation for seeking elected office herself. She instigated a bill, introduced by Larson and eventually signed into law, to require that remains be handled in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased. She also lobbied the legislature, unsuccessfully, for the creation of an interim committee to study palliative care.|$|E
5|$|During their conquests, the Crusaders {{established}} the Latin Rite crusader {{states of the}} Kingdom of Jerusalem, the County of Tripoli, the Principality of Antioch, and the County of Edessa. This was contrary to <b>the</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Rite Byzantines, who wanted the land that the Muslims took from them returned, rather than occupied by Latin Catholics. After the retaking of Jerusalem, most of the crusaders returned home. This left the crusader kingdoms vulnerable from Muslim reconquests during the Second and Third Crusades.|$|E

5|$|Somewhere in {{the years}} 416–415 BC, a complex {{struggle}} took place between Hyperbolos {{on one side and}} Nicias and Alcibiades on the other. Hyperbolos tried to bring about the ostracism of one of this pair, but Nicias and Alcibiades combined their influence to induce the people to expel Hyperbolos instead. This incident reveals that Nicias and Alcibiades each commanded a personal following, whose votes were determined by <b>the</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaders.|$|E
5|$|A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's {{presence}} and numbers late on Thursday March 21. The next morning, a Muslim conference of war convened, {{and there was}} dispute over how to best repel the Meccans. Muhammad {{and many of the}} senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to <b>the</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle.|$|E
5|$|According to the Constitution of 1831, the Belgian {{government}} {{was allowed to}} override <b>the</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King {{if he had been}} declared incompetent to reign. On 28 May 1940, under pressure from the French government, the Pierlot government in France declared the King to be under the power of the invaders and unfit to reign according to article 82, providing strong legal foundations and making itself the only official source of government. The government, however, refused to declare a republic. Although the King technically remained the only person able to receive diplomatic legations and conclude treaties, the government in exile was able to do both during the war independently.|$|E
50|$|Generally most Acts {{will come}} into force, or become legally {{enforceable}} in a manner as prescribed in the Act itself. Either it would come into effect from <b>the</b> date <b>of</b> assent by <b>the</b> President (mostly in case of Ordinances which is later approved by the Parliament), or a specific date is mentioned in the Act itself (mostly in case of Finance Bills) or on a date as per <b>the</b> <b>wish</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central or the State Government {{as the case may}} be. In case <b>the</b> commencement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act is as made as per <b>the</b> <b>wish</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government, a separate Gazette notification is made, which is mostly accompanied by the Rules or subordinate legislation in another gazette notification.|$|R

5|$|Despite the new {{leadership}} in the city, there were still conservative strongholds. One of Moscone's first acts as mayor was appointing a police chief to the embattled San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). He chose Charles Gain, against <b>the</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SFPD. Most of the force disliked Gain for criticizing the police in the press for racial insensitivity and alcohol abuse on the job, instead of working within the command structure to change attitudes. By request of the mayor, Gain {{made it clear that}} gay police officers would be welcomed in the department; this became national news. Police under Gain expressed their hatred of him, and of the mayor for betraying them.|$|E

If the difficulty, real or supposed, has grown out of the circumstances of my having been connected with the negotiation at St Mary's, I feel it my duty to state to the committee that I acted from an entire conviction of its propriety and an anxious desire, on my part, to promote the welfare and accomplish <b>the</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole people of the State in assisting to add a large and fertile tract of country to that which we already possess.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, Germany and Italy were {{becoming}} more aggressive. In March 1938, Germany annexed Austria, again provoking little response from other European powers. Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the Sudetenland, {{an area of}} Czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic German population; and soon Britain and France followed the counsel of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and conceded this territory to Germany in the Munich Agreement, which was made against <b>the</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Czechoslovak government, {{in exchange for a}} promise of no further territorial demands. Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to Hungary and Poland annexed Czechoslovakia's Zaolzie region.|$|E

In 1989, in recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wish</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> women members {{to develop their own}} dance traditions, <b>the</b> office <b>of</b> foreman was replaced with a men's foreman and a women's foreman.|$|R

However, cognitive function remained intact (MMSE 28). <b>The</b> <b>wish</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patient was to not be hospitalized again and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family for prolongation of life.|$|R
25|$|In <b>the</b> wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Syrian Civil War Abkhazia granted {{refugee status}} {{to a few}} hundred Syrians with Abkhaz, Abazin and Circassian ancestry. Facing a growing Armenian community, this move has been linked with <b>the</b> <b>wish</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruling Abkhaz —who have often been in the {{minority}} on their territory— to tilt the demographic balance in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> titular nation.|$|R
5|$|In July 1947, Mandela rushed Lembede, who was ill, to hospital, {{where he}} died; he was succeeded as ANCYL {{president}} {{by the more}} moderate Peter Mda, who agreed to co-operate with communists and non-blacks, appointing Mandela ANCYL secretary. Mandela disagreed with Mda's approach, and in December 1947 supported an unsuccessful measure to expel communists from the ANCYL, considering their ideology un-African. In 1947, Mandela {{was elected to the}} executive committee of the ANC's Transvaal Province branch, serving under regional president C. S. Ramohanoe. When Ramohanoe acted against <b>the</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> committee by co-operating with Indians and communists, Mandela {{was one of those who}} forced his resignation.|$|E
5|$|Later, Bilac {{escapes from}} the room {{in which he is}} being held without exiting through the only door. Mulder notices a large drag mark through the dust on the floor, {{discovering}} a hatch leading to the museum's old steam tunnels. While exploring the tunnels, the agents find the remains of the victims and are attacked by a multitude of feral cats. As they try to escape, they come across Bilac's mutilated body. The two agents make their way out and close the hatch on the pursuing cats. The episode closes with Mulder suspecting that the animal attacks were associated with the burial urn that had been removed against <b>the</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ecuadorian tribespeople; it is shortly returned to the burial grounds, where the local shaman watches the urn's reburial with jaguar-like eyes.|$|E
5|$|ML Pin was {{accepted}} into Brasenose College of the University of Oxford in 1924, {{where he studied}} in the Honour School of Oriental Studies for four years. He graduated with a BA degree on 28 June 1928. He then enrolled in a one-year course in education also at Oxford, according to <b>the</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ministry of Public Instruction. He practice-taught at The Latymer School during the school year, but fell ill during the winter and again {{near the end of}} the school year late in the spring of 1929, which adversely affected his studies. He was later awarded the Oxbridge MA degree on 15 October 1931.|$|E

5|$|On 15 February, Aguirre's term {{of office}} expired. Against <b>the</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Amapolas, the {{moderate}} Tomás Villalba was elected by the Senate to replace Aguirre. French, Italian and Spanish troops landed in Montevideo at Villalba's request to dissuade the radical Blancos from attempting a coup to retake power. Villalba entered into talks with Flores and Paranhos. With the Italian resident minister Raffaele Ulisse Barbolani serving as intermediary, an agreement was reached. Flores and Manuel Herrera y Obes (representing Villalba's government) signed a peace accord on 20 February at the Villa de la Unión. A general amnesty was granted to both Blancos and Colorados, and Villalba handed over the presidency to Flores on an interim basis until elections could be held.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January 1833, at age 29, {{he married}} Ana Luísa de Loreto Carneiro Viana, the sixteen-year-old younger sister {{of an army}} officer friend, {{and a member of}} an aristocratic family of Rio de Janeiro. The union was {{contrary}} to <b>the</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bride's mother, who saw Luís Alves and his family as upstarts. Newspapers connected to political enemies of his family took advantage of this disagreement to level serious, but unfounded, accusations against him, including that he had kidnapped Ana Luísa. Despite the invective, their marriage was a happy one and three children resulted: Luísa de Loreto Viana de Lima, Ana de Loreto Viana de Lima and Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, born in 1833, 1836 and 1847, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Once the Earl Marshal has {{approved}} the petition he will issue his Warrant to the King of Arms, {{this will allow}} them to proceed with the granting of the arms. It is during this stage that the designing and formation of the arms begin. Although the King of Arms has full discretion over the composition of the arms, he will take into full account <b>the</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> applicant. These will include allusions and references to the applicant's life and achievements. The design of any new coat of arms must abide by all the rules of heraldry as well as being entirely original and distinct from all previous arms recorded at the College's archives. A preliminary sketch will then be approved and sent to the petitioner for approval.|$|E
50|$|Cross-border {{cooperation}} between the three neighbours covers today many fields, including tourism, traffic, infrastructure, social services and environmental issues in the sensitive central Alps area. In 2001, the joint Alpendeklaration (Alpine declaration), a charter for sustainable development, called for a reconciliation <b>of</b> economic pressures with <b>the</b> <b>wish</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local population to preserve its living environment.

He increasingly served as acting Secretary of State during Cordell Hull's illnesses. Henderson, then the State Department's Director of the Office of European Affairs, was married to a Latvian woman. He had opened an American Red Cross office in Kaunas, Lithuania after World War I and served in the Eastern European Division of the State Department for 18 years.|$|E
5|$|These {{actions and}} the radicalized {{political}} climate {{eventually led to}} the overthrow of the monarchy, on January17, 1893, by the Committee of Safety, with the covert support of United States Minister John L. Stevens and the landing of American forces from the USS Boston. After a brief transition under the Provisional Government, the oligarchical Republic of Hawaii was established on July4, 1894, with Sanford B. Dole as president. During this period, the defacto government, which was composed largely of residents of American and European ancestry, sought to annex the islands to the United States against <b>the</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Native Hawaiians who wanted to remain an independent nation ruled by the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|While {{the western}} half of New Guinea had been {{administered}} by the Netherlands since 1828, the eastern half was not annexed by any European power until the 1880s. In 1883, fearful of growing foreign influence—particularly the influence of Germany—the British colony of Queensland annexed the south-eastern part of New Guinea, against <b>the</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British government. This initiated German interest in the remaining third of the island and on 3 November 1884, the German flag was raised over Kaiser-Wilhelmsland, the Bismarck Archipelago (formerly New Britain) and the German Solomon Islands. On 17 May 1885, the German Emperor granted an Imperial charter to the newly founded Neuguinea-Kompanie (New Guinea Company) for this annexation, which was further extended to the Solomon Islands on 13 November 1886.|$|E
