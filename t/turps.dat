40|$|Introduction: Transurethral {{resection}} of {{the prostate}} (<b>TURP)</b> syndrome is iatrogenic state of water intoxication after transurethral resection {{of the prostate}}, an endoscopic procedure in urology. Neurological changes, heart failure and respiratory failure, followed with hyper or hypotension and hypoxia and acidemia, are dominant signs in clinical presentation of the <b>TURP</b> syndrome. For the last decade, better understanding of <b>TURP</b> syndrome pathophysiology and development of preventive measures, led to decrease incidence of the <b>TURP</b> syndrome. The present incidence of <b>TURP</b> syndrome is below 1 %. Case report: We are presenting case of severe <b>TURP</b> syndrome developed during endoscopic two hours long urologie procedure. <b>TURP</b> syndrome was manifested with serious neurologic disturbance which has expanded to coma and epileptic seizures, followed with hemodynamic instability requiring inotropic and vasopressor support. Severe hyponatremia (serum Na+ 102 mmol/l) was dominant biochemical finding. We are presenting therapy approach to the patient with severe form of <b>TURP</b> syndrome followed by patient health condition improvement. Conclusion: <b>TURP</b> syndrome is iatrogenic potentially life threatening condition, which may be presented during or after intervention.

40|$|Benign prostatic {{hyperplasia}} (BPHs) affects {{more than}} half of men who are at least 60 years old. Transurethral resection of the prostate (<b>TURP)</b> is the most common treatment. This article estimates the average costs of providing a <b>TURP</b> to a patient that chooses the procedure and the expected cost of a <b>TURP</b> irrespective of the actual treatment decision. It utilizes a modified two-part model. It first estimates the likelihood of receiving the <b>TURP</b> given a BPH diagnosis using a logit regression. The second step is to estimate the (log of) <b>TURP</b> cost for the population that actually received the procedure. For the <b>TURP</b> decision, data were extracted from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) 1986 - 1994 on 502 men with a diagnosis of BPH. For the cost model, HCIA discharge abstract data were used from five states on 26640 men who actually received a <b>TURP</b> in 1994. <b>TURP</b> was identified via CPT codes in the NHIS data. The cost of <b>TURP</b> was constructed using patient hospital charges and hospital-specific cost to charge ratios. It was found that patient characteristics and comorbidities are important determinants of the decision to receive, and costs of, <b>TURP.</b> Pharmacological alternatives to <b>TURP</b> significantly affect the likelihood that a person will choose the procedure. The predicted unconditional cost of <b>TURP</b> ranged from US$ 8908 to US$ 3832 (by state); the predicted conditional cost of <b>TURP</b> ranged from US$ 1163 to US$ 750. The results suggest that the cost associated with providing a <b>TURP</b> for the average man with BPH would be US$ 492 to US$ 1163, depending on the state of residence. It was found that estimating the costs using simple regression or ANOVA techniques will lead to biased results due to sample selection (which in this case range from US$ 3832 to US$ 8908). ...|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{transurethral}} resection {{of the prostate}} (<b>TURP)</b> syndrome is reported after ureteroscopic procedures with irrigating solutions. <b>TURP</b> syndrome may occur quickly or up to 24 hours postoperatively. <b>TURP</b> syndrome affects many systems and manifests itself mainly through acute changes in intravascular volume and plasma solute concentrations. Case report. We reported a 72 - year-old patient with benign prostatic hyperplasia, diabetes mellitus and angina pectoris who underwent <b>TURP</b> under spinal anesthesia. Unusual marked somnolence, bradycardia (38 beats/min), disorientation and face edema indicated a diagnosis of <b>TURP</b> syndrome only 15 minutes after the operation had started. The diagnosis confirmed by arterial gas analyses (metabolic acidosis, pH was 7. 29) and hyponatremia (96 mmol/l).

40|$|Purpose: Transurethral {{resection}} of {{the prostate}} (<b>TURP)</b> is still considered the gold standard {{in the treatment of}} benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, open prostatectomy is indicated for prostate glands over 75 ml. There have been few reports concerning the use of <b>TURP</b> for large prostate glands over 100 ml. Herein we compared the effectiveness of monopolar <b>TURP,</b> bipolar <b>TURP,</b> and open prostatectomy in prostate glands larger than 100 ml. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the data of 48 patients with prostate glands larger than 100 ml. A total of 19, 17, and 12 patients underwent monopolar <b>TURP</b> (group A), bipolar <b>TURP</b> (group B), or open prostatectomy (group C), respectively. Preoperative International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), maximal flow rate (Qmax), prostate volume, resected tissue volume, resection velocity, and operative time were documented. Postoperative hemoglobin, serum sodium change, hospital stay, and postoperative 6 -month IPSS and Qmax were evaluated. Results: The prostate volumes did not differ significantly among the three groups. Operative time was similar in the two <b>TURP</b> groups, but open prostatectomy required a longer operative time. There {{was no significant difference in}} the resected prostate tissue or resection velocity between the two <b>TURP</b> groups. There was a marked decrease in postoperative serum sodium in the monopolar group compared with the other two groups. Among the groups, bipolar <b>TURP</b> required a shorter hospitalization. Postoperative IPSS, quality of life (QoL), and Qmax improved significantly in all groups. Conclusions: Even for large prostate glands, the results of this study suggest that bipolar <b>TURP</b> is an effective and safe operation owing to the significant improvements in voiding symptoms, shorter hospitalization, and fewer complications such as transurethral resection syndrome...|$|R

Early studies have shown a comparable effect on urodynamic outcomes and symptoms compared with <b>TURP,</b> while the length of stay is shorter. Higher costs of materials make the initial costs for GLL higher than for <b>TURP.</b> Aims: To analyse if GLL is less costly and safer than <b>TURP.</b> Methods: Patients who underwent <b>TURP</b> in 2009 (group A) or PVP between January 1 st 2011 and June 30 th 2012 (group B) were included. Only patient with BPH and outflow obstruction were included. Patients with prostate cancer and patients who underwent other surgery were excluded. Several variables were documented including surgery duration, length of stay and complications. Total costs were calculated for both groups and compared. The follow-up was 6 months. Results: 101 patient who underwent <b>TURP</b> and 93 who underwent GLL were included. Mean age was the same between group A (70, 2 years) and group B (69, 3 years).

At 3 months after <b>TURP</b> the patients were reassessed with a flow rate measurement and the IPSS. The baseline IPSS and urodynamic values were analysed {{with respect to the}} endpoints of the study, flow rate and IPSS after <b>TURP,</b> and the improvements thereof, respectively. RESULTS: There were significant improvements in mean IPSS (- 10. 87 points) and peak flow rate (+ 7. 06 mL/s) 3 months after <b>TURP.</b> Classifying the patients into subgroups with distinctly different initial values for IPSS, flow rate, residual urine volume and degree of obstruction (as expressed by Abrams-Griffiths number) showed that the flow rate and degree of obstruction influenced the improvement in flow rate but not in symptoms after <b>TURP.</b> Symptom improvement was only related to the initial level of symptoms. In a multivariate analysis, only age was an independent predictor of the outcome variables of flow rate and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical decision-making remains a valid instrument for selecting patients for <b>TURP.</b> Both the IPSS and pressure-flow assessment are useful to exclude patients who are unlikely to benefit from <b>TURP.</b> Age is an important predictor of the improvement in symptoms and flow rates after <b>TURP</b> for the lower urinary tract symptom complex associated with benign prostatic enlargement...|$|R

Materials and Methods: This study examined 60 male patients planned for elective <b>TURP.</b> The level of serum electrolytes are determined by taking venous blood samples preoperatively and Postope-ratively and when the duration of the operation was longer than 60 minutes, the level of serum electrolytes was determined intraoperative. The amount of used irrigation fluid, the weight of resec-tion prostate, and duration of surgery, were also followed. Patients were divided in two groups according to the length of the surgical procedure: Group 1 (30 – 60 min) and Group 2 (> 60 min). Results: Statistically significant reduction of serum sodium and the elevation of the potassium level in serum observed postoperatively and was directly proportional to the volume of of the used irrigation fluid, the duration of the procedure and volume of the resected prostate. Conclusions: To evaluate changes in serum electrolyte during <b>TURP</b> is simple and economical method for the indirect estimation of irrigation fluid absorption into the systemic circulation during <b>TURP</b> and opportunity for early identification of <b>TURP</b> syndrome.
