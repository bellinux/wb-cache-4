50|$|TERF 1 gene encodes a {{telomere}} specific protein {{which is}} {{a component of the}} telomere nucleoprotein complex. This protein is present at telomeres throughout the cell cycle and functions as an inhibitor of telomerase, acting in cis to limit the elongation of individual chromosome ends. It is known to protect telomeres in mammals from DNA mechanisms that are used for repair purposes {{and at the same time}} regulate the activity carried out by telomerase. The <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat</b> binding factor 1 protein is present at telomeres, where the cells aging aspect is monitored, throughout the typical cell cycle process. The progressive loss of the telomeric ends of chromosomes is an important mechanism in the timing of human cellular aging. <b>Telomeric</b> <b>Repeat</b> Factor 1 (TRF1) is a protein that binds at telomere ends.|$|E
50|$|Telomeric repeats in {{a variety}} of organisms have been shown to form these {{quadruplex}} structures in vitro, and subsequently they have also been shown to form in vivo. The human <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat</b> (which is the same for all vertebrates) consists of many repeats of the sequenced (GGTTAG), and the quadruplexes formed by this structure have been well studied by NMR and X-ray crystal structure determination. The formation of these quadruplexes in telomeres has been shown to decrease the activity of the enzyme telomerase, which is responsible for maintaining length of telomeres and is involved in around 85% of all cancers. This is an active target of drug discovery, including telomestatin.|$|E
50|$|Telomeres {{protect the}} {{chromosome}} from degradation by nucleases and end-to-end fusion. The progressive {{loss of the}} telomeric ends of chromosomes is an important mechanism in the timing of human cellular aging. <b>Telomeric</b> <b>Repeat</b> Factor 1 (TRF1) is a protein that binds at telomere ends.To measure the concentrations of TRF1 and the relationships among telomere length, telomerase activity, and TRF1 levels in tumor and normal colorectal mucosa,from normal and tumoral samples of patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer we analyzed TRF1 protein concentration, and telomerase activity were analysed.As result high levels of TRF1 were observed in 68.7% of tumor samples, {{while the majority of}} normal samples showed negative or weak TRF1 concentrations. Among the tumor samples, telomere length was significantly associated with TRF1 protein levels.In conclusion a relationship exists between telomere length and TRF1 abundance protein in tumor samples, which means that TRF1 {{is an important factor in}} the tumor progression and maybe a diagnostic factor.|$|E
50|$|Other betaherpesviruses {{establish}} latency as {{a nuclear}} episome, {{which is a}} circular DNA molecule (analogous to plasmids). For HHV-6, latency is believed to occur exclusively through the integration of viral <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> into human subtelomeric regions. Only one other virus is known to achieve latency in this fashion. This phenomenon is possible {{as a result of}} the <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> found within the direct repeat termini of HHV-6’s genome.|$|R
40|$|Telomeres, the {{specialized}} DNA-protein structures {{at the ends}} of eukaryotic chromosomes, are required for chromosomal stability and integrity (Blackburn and Szostak 1984; Sandell and Zakian 1993; Blackburn 1994). Telomeric DNA and proteins, together with telomerase, form a dynamic complex, which is the target of action of multiple cellular processes. Coordinating and regulating these processes are key requirements for chro-mosomal stability. In nearly all eukaryotes examined, the telomeric DNA consists of a tract of simple, tandemly repeated sequences located at every chromosomal DNA end. These <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> comprise the essential telomeric DNA sequences required for chromosomal stability and complete replica-tion. One strand of the <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> is synthesized by the ribonucleoprotein telomerase, a cellular reverse tran-scriptase that synthesizes <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> by copying a template sequence within its RNA moiety (Greider an...|$|R
40|$|Telomeres in Chironomus {{consist of}} long complex tandem DNA repeats, which in C. pallidivittatus {{have been shown}} to extend to the extreme end of chromosomes. In C. pallidivittatus the <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> are present in large blocks, 50 - 200 kb in size, most of them {{belonging}} to four major subfamilies. The main issue of this thesis has been to elucidate possible functional roles for these different subfamilies of <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats.</b> Therefore, both intra- and intertelomeric mapping of the subfamilies were performed. One subfamily was found always to be located distally to the others, and have properties that could indicate a role in the protection of the chromosome ends. The subfamily identity of the most proximally situated repeat was identified in five of the seven non-telocentric chromosome ends. The junction between <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> and subterminal sequences was also characterized. In this region species and junction specific mutations were found, which were highly conserved between different chromosome ends within the same species. The homogenization pattern of these mutations indicated that gene conversion can act also between heterologous telomeres. The <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> exhibit a remarkable efficient homogenization whether they are located in the same or in different non-homologous chromosomes, an unusual feature since intrachromosomal homogenization usually are more efficient than homogenization between heterologues. Results from several earlier investigations had suggested transcriptional activity in the <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> in Chironomus. This issue was now addressed both in relation to possible roles for the different subfamilies in this transcription, and if this could be a connection to a process active in the elongation of the telomeres...|$|R
40|$|In all telomerases, the {{template}} {{region of the}} RNA subunit contains a region of telomere homology that is longer than the unit <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat.</b> This allows a newly synthesized <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat</b> to translocate back to the 3 ′ end of {{the template}} prior to {{a second round of}} <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat</b> synthesis. In the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, the telomerase RNA (Ter 1) template has 30 nucleotides of perfect homology to the 25 -bp <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat.</b> Here we provide strong evidence that three additional nucleotides at positions − 2 through − 4 present on the 3 ′ side of the template form base-pairing interactions with telomeric DNA. Mutation of these bases can lead to opposite effects on telomere length depending on the sequence permutation of the template {{in a manner consistent with}} whether the mutation increases or decreases the base-pairing potential with the telomere. Additionally, mutations in the − 2 and − 3 positions that restore base-pairing potential can suppress corresponding sequence changes in the <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat.</b> Finally, multiple other yeast species were found to also have telomerase RNAs that encode relatively long 7 - to 10 -nucleotide domains predicted to base pair, often with imperfect pairing, with telomeric DNA. We further demonstrate that K. lactis telomeric fragments produce banded patterns with a 25 -bp periodicity. This indicates that K. lactis telomeres have preferred termination points within the 25 -bp <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{macrostructure}} of {{the tomato}} telomeres {{has been investigated}} by in situ hybridization, genomic sequencing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In situ hybridizations with a cloned telomeric sequence from Arabidopsis thaliana indicated that the <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat</b> of tomato cross-hybridizes with that of Arabidopsis and is located at all telomeres. Bal 31 digestion kinetics confirmed that the tomato <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat</b> represents the outermost DNA sequence of each tomato chromosome. Genomic sequencing of enriched tomato telomeric sequences, using primers derived from the Arabidopsis sequence, revealed that the consensus sequence of the tomato <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat</b> is TT(T/A) AGGG compared with the Arabidopsis consensus sequence of TTTAGGG. Furthermore, as shown by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, the <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat</b> of tomato is separated by not {{more than a few}} hundred kilobases from a previously described 162 -base pair satellite DNA repeat of tomato (TGR I) at 20 of the 24 telomeres. Together, these sequences are found in the heterochromatic terminal knob observed in pachytene chromosomes. Therefore, these two repeats determine the structure of 20 of the 24 tomato chromosome ends over approximately 2 % of the total chromosome length...|$|E
40|$|We have {{analysed}} an extracted RNase sensitive fraction containing <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat</b> sequences in the telomerase negative dipteran Chironomus tentans. It shows a {{slow and}} well-defined electophoretic migration corresponding to > 20 kb and is sensitive not only to RNase, but also to DNase. It hybridizes to both strands of the <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat</b> with about equal intensities. DNA is probably the dominant component since the fraction is only slightly heavier than genomic DNA in isopycnic gradients but considerably lighter than RNA. It can, nevertheless, be shown to incorporate tritiated uridine. The material might represent another example of extrachromosomal telomeric repeats in telomerase negative cells...|$|E
40|$|ATRX is a {{chromatin}} remodelling factor {{found at}} {{a wide range of}} tandemly repeated sequences including telomeres (TTAGGG) n. ATRX mutations are found in nearly all tumours that maintain their telomeres via the alternative lengthening of telomere (ALT) pathway, and ATRX is known to suppress this pathway. Here we show that recruitment of ATRX to <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> depends on repeat number, orientation and, critically, on repeat transcription. Importantly, the transcribed <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> form RNA-DNA hybrids (Rloops) whose abundance correlates with the recruitment of ATRX. Here we show loss of ATRX is also associated with increased R-loop formation. Our data suggest that the presence of ATRX at telomeres may have a central role in suppressing deleterious DNA secondary structures that form at transcribed <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats,</b> and this may account for the increased DNA damage, stalling of replication and homology directed repair previously observed upon loss of ATRX function...|$|R
40|$|Six {{copies of}} {{insertion}} elements accumulate in the subtelomeric region immediately proximal to the <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> on Chlorella chromosome I. The elements, designated Zepps, bear the characteristic features of non-viral (LINE-like) retrotransposons, including a poly(A) tail, 5 '-truncations, a retroviral reverse transcriptase-like ORF and flanking target duplications. Detailed sequence {{analysis of the}} Chlorella subtelomeric region revealed a novel mechanism of Zepp transposition; successive insertions of each Zepp element into another Zepp as a target, leaving a tandem array of their 3 '-regions with poly(A) tracts facing toward the centromere. Only the most distal Zepp copy was inverted to connect its poly(A) tail with the <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats.</b> A similar Zepp cluster but without the <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> was also found at the terminus of another Chlorella chromosome. These structures contrast with that proposed for the addition of HeT-A and TART elements to Drosophila telomeres. Expression of Zepp elements is induced by heat shock treatment. Possible roles of the subtelomeric retrotransposons in formation and maintenance of telomeres are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{parasitic}} protozoan Trypanosoma brucei {{has some}} hundred mini-chromosomes of 50 - 150 kb, which mainly consist of <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats,</b> sub-telomeric repeats and internal 177 -bp repeats. Their primary function {{seems to be}} to expand the repertoire of non-transcribed sub-telomeric variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes. Here we report that two of the smaller mini-chromosomes (55 and 60 kb) contain sequences homologous to the ribosomal RNA gene promoter region. We have targeted by homologous recombination the neomycin phosphotransferase (neo(r)) gene behind the promoter on the 55 kb chromosome and show that this promoter mediates the efficient synthesis of properly trans-spliced and polyadenylated neo mRNA. The resulting high resistance to G 418 (a neo analogue) is stable in the absence of drug showing that mitotic segregation of this mini-chromosome is precise. Downstream of the transcription start the wild-type version of the ribosomal promoter is flanked by <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats.</b> The absence of the sub-telomeric repeats found in other T. brucei chromosome ends suggests that the rDNA-telomeric junction has been formed by de novo addition of <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> to a broken chromosome end (healing). Our results provide a plausible explanation for the alpha-amanitin-resistant transcription of <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> in T. brucei reported by Rudenko and Van der Ploeg and they show that trypanosomes can efficiently use RNA polymerase I for the expression of sub-telomeric genes, supporting the notion that the alpha-amanitin-resistant transcription of sub-telomeric VSG genes may also be catalyzed by this enzyme...|$|R
40|$|We have {{determined}} {{the stability of}} intramolecular DNA quadruplexes in which the four G 3 -tracts are connected by non-nucleosidic linkers containing propanediol, octanediol or hexaethylene glycol, replacing the TTA loops in the human <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat</b> sequence. We find that these sequences all fold to form intramolecular complexes, which are stabilized by lithium < sodium < potassium. Quadruplex stability increases in the order propanediol < hexaethylene glycol < octanediol. The shallower shape of the melting profile with propanediol linkers and its lower dependency on potassium concentration suggests that this complex contains fewer stacks of G-quartets. The sequence with octanediol linkers displays a biphasic melting profile, suggesting that it can adopt more than one stable structure. All these complexes display melting temperatures above 310 K {{in the presence of}} 10 mM lithium, without added potassium, in contrast to the <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat</b> sequence. These complexes also fold much faster than the <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat</b> and {{there is little or no}} hysteresis between their melting and annealing profiles. In contrast, the human <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat</b> sequence and a complex containing two hexaethylene glycol groups in each loop, are less stable and fold more slowly. The melting and annealing profiles for the latter sequence show significant differences, even when heated at 0. 2 °C min– 1. CD spectra for the oligonucleotides containing non-nucleosidic linkers show positive maxima at 264 nm, with negative minima ∼ 244 nm, which are characteristic of parallel quadruplex structures. These results show that the structure and stability of intramolecular quadruplexes is profoundly influenced by the length and composition of the loops...|$|E

In particular, the study proved the presence of NOR heteromorphism and suggested the possible role of the transposable element mariner in its genesis. In situ hybridization with the 5 S rDNA probe proved the presence of just one 5 S-bringing chromosome pair, whereas hybridization with the <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat</b> revealed small bright hybridization spots, uniform in size and intensity, on each telomere of all chromosomes but no interstitial signals were noticed...|$|E

Here, we show that the conformational behavior of the telomeric repeats in X. laevis egg extract or in Ficoll is notably different from that observed {{in the presence of}} PEG. While the behavior of the <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat</b> in X. laevis egg extract or in Ficoll resembles results obtained under dilute conditions, PEG promotes the formation of high-order parallel topologies.

40|$|Epigenetic {{mechanisms}} {{are involved in}} regulation of crucial cellular processes in eukaryotic organisms. Data on the epigenetic features of plant telomeres and their epigenetic regulation were published mostly for Arabidopsis thaliana, in which the presence of interstitial <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> (ITRs) may interfere with genuine telomeres in most analyses. Here, we studied the epigenetic landscape and transcription of telomeres and ITRs in Nicotiana tabacum with long telomeres and no detectable ITRs, and in Ballantinia antipoda with large blocks of pericentromeric ITRs and relatively short telomeres. Chromatin of genuine telomeres displayed heterochromatic as well as euchromatic marks, while ITRs were just heterochromatic. Methylated cytosines were present at telomeres and ITRs, but showed a bias with more methylation towards distal telomere positions and different blocks of B. antipoda ITRs methylated to different levels. Telomeric transcripts TERRA (G-rich) and ARRET (C-rich) were identified in both plants and their levels varied among tissues with a maximum in blossoms. Plants with substantially different proportions of internally and terminally located <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> are instrumental in clarifying the chromatin status of <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> at distinct chromosome locations...|$|R

40|$|DNA minor groove‐binding {{compounds}} (polyamides) {{that target}} insect and vertebrate <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> with high specificity were synthesized. Base pair recognition of these polyamides {{is based on}} the presence of the heterocyclic amino acids pyrrole and imidazole. One compound (TH 52 B) interacts uniquely and with excellent specificity (Kd = 0. 12 nM) with two consecutive insect‐type <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> (TTAGG). A related compound, TH 59, displays high specificity (Kd = 0. 5 nM) for tandem vertebrate (TTAGGG) and insect <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats.</b> The high affinity and specificity of these compounds were achieved by bidentate binding of two flexibly linked DNA‐binding moieties. Epifluorescence microscopy studies show that fluorescent derivatives of TH 52 B and TH 59 stain insect or vertebrate telomeres of chromosomes and nuclei sharply. Importantly, the telomere‐specific polyamide signals of HeLa chromosomes co‐localize with the immunofluorescence signals of the telomere‐binding protein TRF 1. Our results demonstrate that telomere‐specific compounds allow rapid estimation of relative telomere length. The insect‐specific compound TH 52 was shown to be incorporated rapidly into growing Sf 9 cells, underlining the potential of these compounds for telomere biology and possibly human medicine...|$|R

40|$|Telomeres {{are complex}} {{structures}} that serve to protect chromosome ends. Here we {{provide evidence that}} in Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomeres may contain an anticheckpoint activity that prevents chromosome ends from signaling cell cycle arrest. We found that an internal tract of telomeric repeats inhibited DNA damage checkpoint signaling from adjacent double-strand breaks (DSBs); cell cycle arrest lasted 8 - 12 h from a normal DSB, whereas it lasted only 1 - 2 h from a DSB adjacent to a <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat.</b> The shortened or abridged arrest was {{not the result of}} DNA repair, nor reduced amounts of single-stranded DNA, nor of adaptation. The molecular identity of this telomere repeat-associated anticheckpoint activity is unknown, though it is not dependent upon telomerase or telomere-proximal gene silencing. The anticheckpoint may inhibit the ATR yeast ortholog Mec 1 because Rad 9 and Rad 53 became dephosphorylated and inactivated during the abridged arrest. The anticheckpoint acts regionally; it inhibited signaling from DNA breaks up to 0. 6 kb away from the <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat</b> but not from a DSB present on a separate chromosome. We propose that after formation of the DSB near the <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeat,</b> a mature telomere forms in 1 - 2 h, and the telomere then contains proteins that inhibit checkpoint signaling from nearby DNA breaks...|$|E

Chromosomes of this plant were studied using conventional acetic-orcein staining and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH). FISH showed the major 35 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) site at the secondary constriction of satellite chromosome (3) and the minor 35 S rDNA site near 5 S rDNA cluster in the monobrachial chromosome 5. <b>Telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> were detected at all chromosome ends within secondary constriction in satellited chromosome 3 and at the centromeric regions of chromosomes 1 and 2.

40|$|Instability and {{plasticity}} of telomeric DNA, {{which includes}} extrachromosomal DNA, are usually {{correlated with the}} absence of telomerase and with abnormal growth of mammalian cells. Here, we show the formation of extrachromosomal circular DNA of <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> (tel-eccDNA) during the development of Xenopus laevis. Tel-eccDNA is double-stranded relaxed circles composed of the vertebrate consensus <b>telomeric</b> <b>repeats</b> (TTAGGG) n. Its size varies from 20 kb and it comprises up to 10 % of the total cellular telomere content of the early embryo (pre-MBT stage). The amount of tel-eccDNA is reduced in later developmental stages and in adult tissues. Using a cell-free system derived from Xenopus egg extracts, we show that tel-eccDNA can be formed de novo from the telomere chromosomal tracts of sperm nuclei and naked DNA in a replication-independent manner. These results reveal an unusual plasticity of telomeric DNA during normal development of Xenopus...|$|R
