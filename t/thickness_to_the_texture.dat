50|$|When a texel is {{requested}} that is outside of <b>the</b> <b>texture,</b> {{one of two}} techniques is used: clamping or wrapping. Clamping limits <b>the</b> texel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> size, moving it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearest edge if {{it is more than}} <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> size. Wrapping moves the texel in increments of <b>the</b> <b>texture's</b> size <b>to</b> bring it back into <b>the</b> <b>texture.</b> Wrapping causes a texture to be repeated; clamping causes it to be in one spot only.|$|R

40|$|A yukata {{is a type}} of {{traditional}} Japanese kimono. An alignment of its texture pattern is an important factor of the yukata design. There are rules in <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> alignment of <b>the</b> yukata. The rules are comparratively simple. However, <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> alignment is difficult for the designer because <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> alignment should be performed with consideration <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rules and the wearer's taste, Additioanlly, it is necessary for <b>the</b> designer <b>to</b> create <b>the</b> cutting pattern from a limited length of the kimono cloth. Consequently, a design support system for the yukata is required. We have developed the image processing algorithm <b>to</b> simulate <b>the</b> condition of <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> alignment. It becomes possible <b>to</b> perform <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> alignment based on the traditioonal rule automatically. However, some cutting pattern becomes over length of a standard kimono cloth. In this paper, we describe a multi-agent system for supporting <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> alignment of <b>the</b> yukata. We developed texture alignment agents, and a management agent. The management agent acts management of the wearer's body sizes, the condition of <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> alignment and <b>the</b> cutting pattern and orders <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> alignment agents <b>to</b> carry out <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> alignment according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wearer's taste.
