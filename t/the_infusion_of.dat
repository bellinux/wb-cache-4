5|$|The breed {{became more}} popular still {{following}} the French Revolution and the aftermath in which hunting {{was no longer}} restricted to the nobility. Although spread throughout France, a large concentration was located in the north west where the weather resistant coat of the breed made it ideal for the wooded and swampy conditions. During the early 19th century, British hunters crossed the channel to hunt in the grounds of north west France. The British brought their own hunting dogs, and {{this resulted in a}} change of preference as French hunters switched to English breeds and caused a major blow to the existence of the Picardy Spaniel.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1943, No. 9 OG, {{originally}} the RAAF's mobile strike formation, had effectively become a static garrison force in New Guinea. Bostock proposed that it be renamed Northern Area Command to better reflect its current function. Kenney asked Bostock to raise a new RAAF mobile formation, {{which led to the}} establishment of No.10 Operational Group (No.10 OG) on 13November 1943 at Nadzab, under the command of Group Captain Frederick Scherger. In February 1944, RAAF Command took over many of the units of No.9 OG, as well as responsibility for the Port Moresby and Milne Bay sectors. Bostock again recommended changing No.9 OG's name to Northern Area, and also proposed changing No.10 OG's name to Tactical Air Force, RAAF, in view of its increased strength from <b>the</b> <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> new squadrons. No.9 OG became Northern Command on 11April. On 14September, Bostock had an audience with Prime Minister Curtin, wherein the latter outlined his preferences for the deployment of RAAF Command, particularly that it should be represented in forward Allied operations, and employed primarily in the support of Australian ground forces. Bostock concurred; Curtin meanwhile authorised changing No.10 OG's name to First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), with effect from 25October. RAAF Command's complement had now swelled to forty-one Australian squadrons.|$|E

5|$|The Raptors {{continued}} to rebuild during the 2005 NBA draft, selecting Charlie Villanueva, Joey Graham, Roko Ukić and Uroš Slokar, with Villanueva's selection being very controversial amongst basketball pundits and Raptors fans alike. The Raptors started their training camp by trading Alston to the Houston Rockets for Mike James and signing free agent José Calderón {{as a backup}} for James. Despite <b>the</b> <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> new players, Toronto's overall 2005–06 season was a disappointment; they set a franchise record by losing their first nine games and 15 out of their first 16 games. With losses mounting and media scrutiny intensifying, the Raptors hired ex-Purdue coach Gene Keady as an assistant off the bench to help develop the young Raptors team, as well as establish a defensive persona for the team. On January 15, 2006, the Raptors set a franchise points record in a 129–103 win over the Knicks when Villanueva hit a three-pointer late in the game. But {{less than a week}} later, the Raptors gave up an 18-point lead against the Los Angeles Lakers and allowed Lakers star Kobe Bryant to score 81 points, the second highest single-game total in NBA history.

5|$|Kaleski's {{standard}} {{was adopted by}} breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into {{the early history of}} the breed. However, dog breeder and author Noreen Clark has noted that his opinions are sometimes just that, and he introduces some contradictory assertions in his later writings, as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science. Some of these have persisted; for example he saw the red colour form as having more dingo in it than the blue form, and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues. The most enduring of Kaleski's myths relate to Dalmatian and Kelpie infusions into the early Cattle Dog breed. These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski's writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain the Cattle Dog's mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie, respectively. The genetics of coat colour, and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics, make <b>the</b> <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> Dalmatian to increase the cattle dog's tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event. There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, so most dogs of any breed would have been accustomed to horses. The Kelpie breed was developed after the Cattle Dog type was described, so its infusion is unlikely. It is possible that there was some infusion of Bull Terrier but there is no verifiable record of this, and the Cattle Dog has not had the Bull Terrier's instinct to bite and hold, which would have been an undesirable trait. Early in the 1900s there was considerable in-fighting amongst members of the Cattle Dog Club, and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time. While many of these arguments were misleading, some irrational, and the majority not supported by historical facts, they continue to be circulated, resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed. In recent years, information technology enabling the manipulation of large databases combined with advances in the understanding of canine genetics has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed.|$|E

Recent observations suggest that activation of α-adrenoceptors can inhibit the release of nitric oxide. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the effect of α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptor activation on nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation. Methodology: In a first set of experiments, the endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine (ACh), 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 HT), and bradykinin (BK), and the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were administered in a random order in the brachial artery together with saline, or the nonselective α-adrenoceptor agonists norepinephrine or clonidine, or the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). <b>The</b> <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> saline, norepinephrine, clonidine, and L-NMMA started 10 minutes before <b>the</b> <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> ACh, BK, 5 HT, and SNP. In a second set of experiments, cumulative doses of ACh, BK, and 5 HT were infused, in a random order, intra-arterially together with saline or the selective α 1 -adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine. <b>The</b> <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> saline and methoxamine started 5 minutes before <b>the</b> <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> ACh, BK, and 5 HT. Forearm blood flow was measured using computerized venous occlusion plethysmography. Results: ACh, 5 HT, BK, and SNP induced a significant increase in forearm blood flow (p < 0. 05 for all). These vasodilator responses were significantly attenuated by norepinephrine, clonidine, and L-NMMA (p < 0. 05 for all), except for SNP. In the second set of experiments, all three endothelium-dependent vasodilators induced a dose-dependent vasodilation, which was significantly inhibited by methoxamine (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: These results show that endothelium-dependent nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation is inhibited by activation of peripheral α 1 -adrenoceptors.

40|$|The {{activities}} of glycogen phosphorylase and synthase during <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> glucagon, isoproterenol, or cyanide in isolated liver of fed rats submitted to short-term insulin-induced hypoglycemia (IIH) was investigated.

The experiments {{were carried out}} 60 min after insulin (IIH group) or saline (COG group) injection. The rats were anesthetized and after laparotomy, blood was collected from the vena cava for glucose and insulin measurements. The liver was their infused with glucagon (1 nM), isoproterenot (2 mu M), or cyanide (0. 5 mM) during 20 min and {{a sample of the}} organ was collected for determination of the {{activities of}} glycogen phosphorylase and synthase 5 min after starting and 10 min after stopping <b>the</b> <b>infusions.</b> <b>The</b> <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> cyanide, glucagons, and isoproterenol did not change the activities of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase.
