40|$|Abstract: This paper {{studies the}} {{determinants}} of credit to firms in Argentina. We find {{that the cost of}} credit in the margin (measured by authorized overdrafts) is smaller for firms with large assets, that offer collateral, with a good credit history and with close relationships to the marginal financial institution. Parallel to this, we find that the availability of credit lines in the main bank (measured by the unused credit lines as a proportion of <b>total</b> <b>financial</b> <b>liabilities)</b> depends positively on the assets of the firms, on its collateral, on a good credit history, and on close relationships with the main financial institution. This measure of availability of credit is less ambiguous than traditional measures like leverage, that are affected in opposite directions by demand and supply factors. The Argentine financial system seems to have substantially reduced the degree of asymmetric information through its public credit bureau system...|$|E
40|$|An Income Gap Theory and it {{effects on}} Unemployment and Economic Growth By Drs Kees De Koning Abstract An income gap is often {{described}} as the difference in incomes between the rich and poor. This is a relative gap. In economies a different income gap can occur which can be defined as the absolute income gap. Such a gap emerges when collectively individual households show an income shortfall and become unable to buy all goods and services available in an economy. The principal cause why such a gap can emerge {{is to be found in}} the use of savings. Savings -financial assets- are turned into financial liabilities -loans or other commitments to governments, banks, companies or other individuals. If any of these households do not return such savings for the full amount or only with a lower return a financial loss will occur. The net worth of all individual households - their equity base- will be written down. In this study the focus has been on the U. S. and the U. K. In 2004 in both countries the respective governments plus their individual households had accelerated their borrowing levels from earlier years to the highest levels since 1996. In the U. S. 17. 41 % of the GDP value was financed by the increase in government’ plus individual households’ borrowings in 2004. In the U. K. the level was 14. 50 % in the same year. Government’ and individual household debt has been added up for the simple reason that individual households are ultimately responsible to service both debts. More than 70 % of individual households’ borrowings are used for buying a home. When the pace of borrowing accelerates, the volume of house building usually can not keep pace with the money flows and home prices start to increase rapidly. This happened in 2003 and 2004 and in the years in the run up to 2008. Of course incomes did not grow at the same speed as these borrowing levels. Banks did invent all kinds of loan features to get low income families on the property ladder. They also sold a substantial part of the risks to outside investors. The results were enormous loan losses, which translated in even bigger losses to the net worth of individual households in 2008. In the U. S in 2008 these households lost the equivalent of 110 % of the value of the U. S. GDP from their net worth. In the U. K. the loss was about 90 % of the U. K. ’s GDP in the same year. Individual households did not mean to lose these amounts, however they were at the receiving end of the loss making activities of banks and the financial sector. Individual households were generally speaking not the gamblers. The effects of such equity losses were substantial. Job losses occurred, which meant income losses; lower labour force participation rates showed up which again caused additional income losses; wages settlements did no longer keep pace with inflation levels. This also caused income losses. Furthermore individual households started to save more and repay their outstanding home mortgage debt, which caused another drain on economic growth. The net equity loss caused a substantial income loss to individual households, further aggravated by the rapidly increasing government debt situations. When income levels are down, one usually looks at the savings levels. However the main savings element is pension funds and they are currently prevented by government rules for turning some of the individual households’ equity into cash incomes at times when the income gap occurs. There are ways to counteract and prevent the absolute income gap occurring. The key is to act as fast as possible as lost individual incomes from jobs cannot be recouped in future years. Pension funds can help as they currently have accumulated funds both in the U. S. and the U. K. outstripping <b>total</b> <b>financial</b> <b>liabilities</b> of individual households. Long term fixed rates mortgages can help, which if granted through one major vehicle, can help slow down or speed up mortgage lending in a country. The key to economic growth can be found, but also has to be found, through considering what happened and happens to the collective of individual households, their equity and income position and their actions taken by them and for them. What governments, central banks, banks and companies do is all reflected in the net equity base and income developments of individual households. Economic studies should start with individual households rather than focussing so strongly on governments, central banks and banks. ...|$|E

Though the net liability of the sale was valued at nearly $200 million, including existing unsold inventory and ongoing music license fees, analysts believe that Harmonix-SBE paid only $50 for the company, taking on the <b>total</b> <b>financial</b> <b>liability</b> that Viacom was able to write off in their books.

40|$|Executive summary: While Commonwealth {{government}} debt {{has been the}} focus of attention recently, this report takes a broader view by bringing state debt into the picture. Much has been made of the fact that Commonwealth {{government debt}} is projected (under current expenditure and tax policies) to grow from $ 300 billion at June 2013 to more than $ 400 billion in 2016 – 17 — and keep growing. Over the same four years, net debt (after deducting certain financial assets) is expected to grow from $ 153 billion to $ 280 billion and then to $ 325 billion in 2018 – 19, at which point it will peak as a percentage of GDP. State debt has also risen dramatically since 2007, when net debt was negative. In the six years to 2013, states added $ 70 billion to their general government net debt to reach a positive level of $ 43 billion. Aggregate state debt is manageable at that level, but the upward trend is of concern—and more so in some states than others. By 2016 – 17, combined Commonwealth and state general government (GG) net debt will exceed $ 350 billion—almost 20 % of GDP, or more meaningfully, more than 50 % of general government revenue. The general government debt figures do not tell the full story. For the broader non-financial public sector (which includes non-financial public corporations), state net debt was much higher at $ 127 billion in 2013. Combined with the Commonwealth, total non-financial public sector net debt was $ 283 billion, already 50 % of the sector’s revenue. Public corporations’ debt is guaranteed by their government owners, but these corporations are better able to carry debt as their investments are supposed to be commercially viable. The above figures exclude non-debt <b>financial</b> <b>liabilities</b> such as unfunded superannuation and long-service leave liabilities. These loom large in state finances. When added to net debt, non-debt <b>financial</b> <b>liabilities</b> bring the 2013 <b>total</b> of net <b>financial</b> <b>liabilities</b> to $ 190 billion for state general government and $ 319 billion for the state non-financial public sector. In most states, general government net <b>financial</b> <b>liabilities</b> in 2013 exceeded 100 % of revenue, having increased steeply since 2007. The states’ financial position has deteriorated because their net operating surpluses have shrunk while capital (‘infrastructure’) spending soared, resulting in large cash deficits. All states have experienced this deterioration: Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania have lost the coveted triple-A credit rating, and NSW and Victoria are at risk of being downgraded should current trends continue. All states have curbed the growth of operating expenditure, but they will need to persevere in the face of sluggish revenue if they are to rebuild operating surpluses and avoid sharp cuts in capital expenditure...|$|R
