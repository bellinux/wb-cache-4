2500|$|The {{plan was}} also vociferously criticized from the start, {{not the least}} {{because it did not}} take into account the natural {{topography}} of the island, but also because it took no notice of classical ideas about beauty, and was monotonous in its regularity. It was also lambasted for being made in service of monetary interests alone. Among the many critics of the plan were Edgar Allan Poe and Alexis de Toqueville who believed that it fostered [...] "relentless monotony." [...] Walt Whitman, the poet and editor of The Brooklyn Eagle, said of it: [...] "Our perpetual dead flat and streets cutting each other at right angles, are certainly <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the world consistent with beauty of situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2011, Duckworth {{launched}} {{her campaign}} {{to run in}} 2012 for Illinois's 8th congressional district. Duckworth defeated former Deputy Treasurer of Illinois Raja Krishnamoorthi for the Democratic nomination on March 20, 2012, then faced incumbent Republican Joe Walsh in the general election. Duckworth received the endorsement of both the Chicago Tribune and the Daily Herald. Walsh generated controversy when in July 2012, at a campaign event, he accused Duckworth of politicizing her military service and injuries, saying [...] "my God, that's all she talks about. Our true heroes, {{the men and women}} who served us, it's <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the world they talk about." [...] Walsh called the controversy over his comments [...] "a political ploy to distort my words and distract voters" [...] and said that [...] "Of course Tammy Duckworth is a hero ... I have called her a hero hundreds of times." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{tell the}} truth, though, about the pin, {{although}} I mentioned it almost <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the previous chapter, I assure {{you it was}} by no means <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> my thoughts. It had come home from Mr. Polonius's, as I said, on Saturday night; and Gus and I happened to be out enjoying ourselves, half-price, at Sadler's Wells; and perhaps we took a little refreshment on our way back: but {{that has nothing to do}} with my story.|$|E

60|$|In the meantime, we {{had found}} nothing of any value but the silver and the trinkets, and neither of these were in our way. Underneath {{there was an old}} boat-cloak, whitened with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar. My mother pulled it up with impatience, and there lay before us, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chest, a bundle tied up in oilcloth, and looking like papers, and a canvas bag that gave forth, at a touch, the jingle of gold.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain: [...] "You dare! No, {{it shall}} be opened <b>the</b> very <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, now, to punish you! How is poor Sue? I saw her {{literally}} dropping by the way at Shumaker's." ...|$|R
60|$|Jenny {{tried to}} make him {{understand}} that dread of the Bishop was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> Herbert's mind. It was rather {{that he did not}} think it right to dissipate away a serious impression.|$|E

60|$|In reality {{nobody was}} more {{surprised}} over this than Lawrence himself.

60|$|The {{chairman}} said, {{and very}} truly, that <b>the</b> most <b>lasting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of man are the roads which Caesar built, {{and it is}} true that he built a lot of them; and they are there yet.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Not that girl--she knows too well!' Mrs. Peck looked round {{our little}} circle {{with a smile}} of intelligence--she had familiar, {{communicative}} eyes. Several of our company had assembled, according to the wont, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the evening, {{of those who are}} cheerful at sea, for the consumption of grilled sardines and devilled bones.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Valeria, if you {{understood}} {{my mother}} as well as I do, a serious explanation of her conduct would be <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the world that you would expect from me. The idea of taking my mother seriously!" [...] He burst out laughing again. [...] "My darling, you don't know how you amuse me." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was almost}} {{too much for the}} {{composure}} even of a man of the world. That this paralytic old fellow should express contempt for his virility was really <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> jests. Luckily he could not take it seriously. But suddenly he thought: 'What if he really has the power to stop my going there, and means to turn them against me!' And his heart quailed.|$|E
50|$|These two {{particles}}, {{unlike the}} ones previously, {{go after the}} verb phrase instead of before the verb phrase. Both of these particles are used to express something {{that has already been}} done previously before the time at which the speaker is talking about it. The only difference between yako and ko is that yako is used for transitive verb phrases and ko is used for intransitive verb phrases. An example sentence using yako would be Hewali-wa meta hasala-wa i tawasolao yako, which means 'That young man had already married the girl.' An example sentence using ko would be Yo-gu ye kalasi ko, meaning 'My house burnt down.' As shown in both sentences since these particles go after the verb phrase they are <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sentence.|$|R

You sent for a nurse and you gave me chloroform here. <b>The</b> very <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> my mind is that you walked to the window, and looked at your watch just before I went off." ...|$|R
5000|$|A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy is {{shot down}} on Christmas Eve when he stumbles upon a robbery-homicide at a {{convenience}} store. A down-on-his-luck L.A. County Sheriff's Dept. homicide detective, Jerry Beck (Johnson), {{is assigned to}} the case. As with every case, he takes this one very emotionally, because [...] "the job" [...] is <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> left <b>in</b> his life, and vows to get the perpetrator no matter what.|$|R

And as for me (even if I went to London), {{questioning}} strange ladies about their characters and accomplishments is <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the world that I am fit to do.

I would dispute {{with you if}} I could, but I can't--I haven't stamina enough. You want to upset me, to upset yourself, to upset Glyde, and to upset Laura; and--oh, dear me!--all {{for the sake of}} <b>the</b> very <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world that is likely to happen. No, dear friend, in the interests of peace and quietness, positively No!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right; now {{go in and}} win," [...] said Dick. There was no {{occasion}} {{to appeal to the}} Yankee clock now. Tongues and throats as well as teeth and jaws were too fully occupied. Babel succumbed for full quarter of an hour, during which period Dick Moy related to Nora the circumstances connected with a recent visit to London, whither he had been summoned as a witness in a criminal trial, and to which, at Nora's earnest entreaty, and with the boy's unwilling consent, he had conveyed Billy Towler. We say unwilling, because Billy, during his long period of convalescence, had been so won by the kindness of Nora, that <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the world he would have consented to bear was separation from her; but, on thinking over it, he was met by this insurmountable difficulty--that <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the world he would consent to do was to disobey her! Between these two influences he went unwillingly to London--for the sake of his education, as Nora said to him--for the sake of being freed from the evil influence of her father's example, as poor Nora was compelled to admit to herself.|$|E
60|$|At {{first he}} looks behind him often to assure himself that Jo is still really following. But look where he will, he still beholds him {{close to the}} {{opposite}} houses, making his way with his wary hand from brick to brick and from door to door, and often, as he creeps along, glancing over at him watchfully. Soon satisfied that <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> his thoughts is {{to give him the}} slip, Allan goes on, considering with a less divided attention what he shall do.|$|E
6000|$|They {{descended into}} a cellar called [...] "The Warehouse," [...] and Kipps had an optical {{illusion}} of errand boys fighting. Some aerial voice said, [...] "Teddy!" [...] and the illusion passed. He looked again, and saw quite clearly {{that they were}} packing parcels and always would be, and that <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> {{the world that they}} would or could possibly do was to fight. Yet he gathered from the remarks Mr. Shalford addressed to their busy backs that they had been fighting--no doubt at some past period of their lives.|$|E
5000|$|... "When Matisse dies, Chagall will be {{the only}} painter left who understands what color is... His canvases are really painted, not just tossed together.

6000|$|... "We don't {{know that}} he came from there, Juan. He {{may have come from}} the {{mountains}} of Biscaya, where fair skins are commoner than they are in the south. It is only that he described to us a port, which must have been Cadiz, as <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> he recollected <b>in</b> Spain." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{gave one}} deep gasp of relief, and {{instantly}} busied himself--though there were {{nearly two hours}} to spare before the train started for London--in packing his bag. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> he put <b>in</b> was his blue satin cravat. [...] "She likes bright colors," [...] he said, [...] "and she may see me in it yet!" ...|$|R
60|$|In the morning, {{not only}} was Jones dead, {{but one of the}} {{stronger}} men who had worked on the firewood squad was found to have hanged himself. A nightmare procession of days set in. For a week, steeling himself to the task, Smoke enforced the exercise and the spruce-tea. And one by one, and in twos and threes, he was compelled to knock off the workers. As he was learning, exercise was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the world for scurvy patients. The diminishing burial squad was kept steadily at work, and a surplus half-dozen graves were always burned down and waiting.|$|E
60|$|I {{am afraid}} you will think me an {{abandoned}} ruffian {{for not having}} acknowledged your more than handsome warm-hearted letter before now. But, as usual, I have been so occupied, and so glad to get up from my desk and wallow in the mud (at present about six feet deep here), that pleasure correspondence is just <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the world I have had leisure to take to. Business correspondence with all sorts and conditions of men and women, O my Mary! {{is one of the}} dragons I am perpetually fighting; and the more I throw it, the more it stands upon its hind legs, rampant, and throws me.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will be a}} very {{unsatisfactory}} one, at best," [...] said Redclyffe, {{trying to}} discover some definite point in his misty reminiscences. [...] "I am a stranger to this country, and was on a pedestrian tour with the purpose of making myself acquainted with the aspects of English scenery and life. I had turned into a footpath, being told that it would lead me within view of an old Hall, which, from certain early associations, I was very desirous of seeing. I think I went astray; at all events, the path became indistinct; and, so far as I can recollect, I had just turned to retrace my steps,--in fact, that is <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> my memory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then by heavens {{it shall}} be for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time. May <b>things</b> <b>in</b> this world and the next go well with me as I am fair to you for the future!" [...] So saying he came up close to her, and took her at once in his arms.|$|R
60|$|Not like opera-dancers. Not at all. And {{not like}} Madame Anybody's {{finished}} pupils. Not the least. It was not quadrille dancing, nor minuet dancing, nor even country-dance dancing. It was neither {{in the old}} style, nor the new style, nor the French style, nor the English style: though it may have been, by accident, a trifle in the Spanish style, which is a free and joyous one, I am told, deriving a delightful air of off-hand inspiration, from the chirping little castanets. As they danced among the orchard trees, and down the groves of stems and back again, and twirled each other lightly round and round, the influence of their airy motion seemed to spread and spread, in the sun-lighted scene, like an expanding circle in the water. Their streaming hair and fluttering skirts, the elastic grass beneath their feet, the boughs that rustled in the morning air - the flashing leaves, the speckled shadows on the soft green ground - the balmy wind that swept along the landscape, glad to turn the distant windmill, cheerily - everything between the two girls, and the man and team at plough upon the ridge of land, where they showed against the sky {{as if they were}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world - seemed dancing too.|$|R
