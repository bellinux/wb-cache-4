5|$|The project, however, found strong resistance. As Carlota {{was married}} to John VI, a prince of Portugal, many people though that Carlotism was a <b>trick</b> <b>to</b> conceal Portuguese expansionism. Carlota herself had {{different}} political ideas than those of her supporters: Belgrano and the others shared the ideas of enlightenment, but Carlota aspired to keep the full power of an absolutist monarchy. By 1810 the project was forgotten.|$|E

Extra possessions earned by face-off specialist Danny Brennan, including both opportunities in the overtime periods and 70% total for the game, helped the Orange stage the comeback. While, Syracuse goalkeeper John Galloway settled down {{in the second half}} and made a number game saving stops as regulation time expired.|$|E

5|$|The Calgary Flames {{declined}} {{an opportunity}} to sign Raymond {{when he was a}} free agent in 2013, but the departure of Michael Cammalleri in 2014 left the team in need of a veteran forward. Calgary signed Raymond to a three-year contract worth $9.5 million. In the second game of the 2014–15 season, Raymond scored the 100th goal of his NHL career as part of this third career hat <b>trick</b> <b>to</b> lead the Flames to a 5–2 victory over the Edmonton Oilers.|$|E
5|$|Booth was not {{cleared for}} full-contact {{practice}} with the team until January 25, 2010. Six days later, {{he returned to the}} lineup for a game against the New York Islanders after being sidelined for 45 contests. During his absence, the Panthers and Flyers played each other on December 21, 2009, {{for the first time since}} Richards' hit. The game included four fights, including one between Panthers defenceman and captain Bryan McCabe and Richards. The teams met again with Booth in the lineup on March 3, 2010. After fighting Richards in the first period (one of four fights in the game and Booth's first in the NHL), Booth scored a goal and three assists (completing a Gordie Howe hat <b>trick)</b> <b>to</b> help the Panthers to a 7–4 win.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{discover}} {{remains of}} normal human babies in Betsy's yard where Weinsider was digging. When seeing the evidence, Mulder deduces that Betsy is another demon who {{is unable to}} have a baby demon unless another demon impregnates her. Unlike Weinsider, she has been terminating pregnancies that resulted in non-demonic fetuses: the very type Weinsider has been so desperate to father. As a demon, she could recognize her husband as a demon in her dream and stop him extracting her baby. However, it becomes apparent that she never lost her baby; it was merely a <b>trick</b> <b>to</b> frame her demon husband. At the end of the narrative, Betsy Monroe drives away with her new demon baby. Her eyes flash with a red gleam before returning to normal.|$|E

5|$|Quatermass II {{received}} positive newspaper {{reviews in}} the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, although the BBC's Radio Times listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt {{it to be}} {{not as good as}} the original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in Haverfordwest who was concerned that she would never find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to Ireland {{to spend the rest of}} her life in a convent; she wondered if the BBC could possibly write to her and let her know how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic <b>trick</b> <b>to</b> uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline's conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.|$|E

However, in 1905 Albert Einstein interpreted Planck's quantum hypothesis realistically and used it to explain the photoelectric effect, in which shining light on certain materials can eject electrons from the material.
