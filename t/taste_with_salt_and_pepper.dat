50|$|In {{northern}} Mexico and in American Tex-Mex cuisine, refried {{beans are}} usually prepared with pinto beans, {{but many other}} varieties of bean are used {{in other parts of}} Mexico, such as black, Peruano, or red (kidney) beans. The raw beans can be cooked when dry or soaked overnight, then stewed, drained of most of the remaining liquid, and converted into a paste with a masher (such as a potato masher), or pressed through a fine mesh sieve (to remove the skins). Some of the drained liquid, or chicken or vegetable stock, is added if the consistency is too dry. The paste is then baked or fried, usually with onion and garlic in a small amount of lard, vegetable oil, bacon drippings or butter <b>and</b> seasoned to <b>taste</b> <b>with</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> spices. Lard is generally used more often in Mexico, and it has a large effect on flavor. Epazote is a common herb used to add a special and unique flavor. It is also a carminative, which means it reduces the gas associated with beans.|$|R
