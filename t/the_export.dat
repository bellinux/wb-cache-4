40|$|This paper investigates whether <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> of {{different}} products {{by the same}} firm are systematically interconnected. Using Swedish firm-registry data from 1997 - 2011, I first document that the distribution of firm export sales is skewed towards their best performing products (‘superstars’). I then use a novel instrumental variable approach to identify if the ‘superstar’ products induce more trade of non-superstar products. I find evidence that <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> of low-ranked (non-star) products of a firm complement <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> of a single superstar product to each destination. Extending the ‘superstar’ concept to a ‘superstar core’ of products strengthens this result (this includes the top decile of products in terms of <b>export</b> value). <b>The</b> results show that a 1 % increase in <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> of <b>the</b> superstar product and the superstar core increases <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> of non-star products by 0. 13 % and 0. 376 %. Hence, I find that <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> of non-star products complements the superstar while conversely, the same complementarity is not found using low-ranked products as placebo-superstars. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} identifying a new, sizeable and systematic intra-firm-destination one-way complementarity between products that is missing in the current models of multi-product exporters...|$|R
