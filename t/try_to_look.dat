25|$|Lolita {{fashion is}} a very {{well-known}} and recognizable style in Japan. Based on Victorian fashion and the Rococo period, girls mix in their own elements along with gothic style to achieve the porcelain-doll look. The girls who dress in Lolita fashion <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> cute, innocent, and beautiful. This look is achieved with lace, ribbons, bows, ruffles, bloomers, aprons, and ruffled petticoats. Parasols, chunky Mary Jane heels, and Bo Peep collars are also very popular.|$|E
500|$|Jamie Waylett of The Advocate {{was more}} critical, saying [...] "Madonna {{delivers}} the worst performance {{in recent memory}} as the heroine of an attempt at screwball comedy. Watching her <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like Marilyn Monroe and sound like Betty Boop, though, is {{a sure sign that}} this film was a disaster in the making. At the same time, it seems inconceivable that anyone would sit down and plan something so dreadful." [...] Carole Kass of the Richmond Times-Dispatch felt that since [...] "Madonna is the idol of teen-agers. If they imitate her hair and her makeup, these 'wanna-bes' who want to be like Madonna and dress like Madonna may be cute. But, as a popular personality, Madonna has a responsibility to her fans. And shoplifting is something not to promote. Nor is smoking." [...] Dan Dinicola of The Schenectady Gazette felt that [...] "Who's That Girl is not simply an awful film, it is positively unbearable. It's a movie without a head or a brain, a picture of such crass stupidity that it can't even make you angry. Instead it numbs you to death with its moronic platitudes, its pretensions to comedy. [...] It's a vanity project which is so amateurly produced and conceived that it makes you want to cringe in shame. [...] Madonna {{is no more than a}} novelty item." [...] Johanna Steinmetz of the Chicago Tribune complimented Dunne's acting and said: [...] "Fortunately the film has Griffin Dunne. Dunne, working in a domain once ruled by Cary Grant, manages to be stuffy, naive and vulnerable but never undignified as Loudon Trott, the New York lawyer." [...] Jean Rosenbluth of Rolling Stone was harsh about the film, saying [...] "The question posed by the film's title was Who's that girl? The answer provided by the box-office receipts was, alas, 'The same one who appeared in Shanghai Surprise and bored us to death'." ...|$|E

He explains, [...] "if you're on the defensive, <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> completely dejected and uninterested, in the hope that your opponent will get careless; but once you start getting your pieces into action and complicating the position, look as confident as possible in an effort to frighten him." [...] Further, when you set a trap, <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> normal, or even to appear nervous if you're sure that you can do so without arousing your opponent's suspicions.|$|E

I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> the way I'm told to. I don't {{know much about the}} emotional side", before adding, [...] "Mr. Fukasaku told me to play myself. I did not really understand, but he told me to play myself, as I ordinarily would be! I'm just trying to do what he tells me." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{her husband}} became president, Julia reconsidered surgery. [...] “I {{never had the}} courage to consent, but now that my husband had become so famous I really thought it behooved me to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> as well as possible.” [...] Ulysses objected: “Did I not see you and fall in love with you with these same eyes? I like them just as they are, and now, remember, you are not to {{interfere}} with them. They are mine, and let me tell you, Mrs. Grant, you had better not make any experiments, as I might not like you half so well with any other eyes.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Within {{media studies}} {{mediation}} {{is also used}} in the same sense as in Marxist theory: thinkers <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at how a given medium reconciles the various forces of history, culture, economics or the material world, and how social actors use that medium to navigate these various meanings and values. The central problem for any media theorist, similar to the problem of a Marxist theorist, is to attempt to analyze what is possible and what is limited by a given medium. Or, in other words, how does the structure of the medium limit how that medium can be used and how do social actors work both within and against that structure? ...|$|E

2500|$|While lauded for her achievements, Davis and her {{films were}} {{sometimes}} derided; Pauline Kael described Now, Voyager (1942) as a [...] "shlock classic," [...] {{and by the}} mid-1940s her sometimes mannered and histrionic performances had become the subject of caricature. Edwin Schallert for the Los Angeles Times praised Davis' performance in Mr. Skeffington (1944), while observing, [...] "the mimics will have more fun than a box of monkeys imitating Miss Davis," [...] and Dorothy Manners at the Los Angeles Examiner said of her performance in the poorly received Beyond the Forest (1949), [...] "no night club caricaturist has ever turned in such a cruel imitation of the Davis mannerisms as Bette turns on herself in this one." [...] Time magazine noted that Davis was compulsively watchable even while criticizing her acting technique, summarizing her performance in Dead Ringer (1964) with the observation, [...] "her acting, as always, isn't really acting: it's shameless showing off. But just <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> away!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, {{the first}} For the Strength of Youth {{pamphlet}} was published, {{and the first}} presidency encouraged youth and their parents to conform to its regulations. It prescribed skirts that covered the kneecaps and forbade low-cut, strapless, and low-backed attire. It encouraged women to [...] "always <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> feminine" [...] and stated that slacks (rather than skirts or dresses) were appropriate only for hiking and other sports. The 1968 For the Strength of Youth pamphlet denounced soiled and sloppy clothing, and said that women {{should not be in}} public with her hair in curlers. In 1972, the pamphlet was changed to state that skirts should be [...] "of modest length." [...] Dallin H. Oaks published a formal dress code for Brigham Young University in 1971, which allowed pant suits but no other pants for women. Jeans were allowed in 1981, and knee-length shorts in 1991. A specific prohibition against tattoos and multiple earrings was added in 2000. Sister missionaries also received special instruction in dressing professionally starting in 1977. The Church published a dress code for its own employees in 1980, which did not allow pant suits.|$|E
