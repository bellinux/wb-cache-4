A theoretical model is proposed starting from a cost function with a random component and assuming that both the public authority and the firm are risk averse. The main outcome of the paper is that the optimal <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> construction <b>risk</b> will be lower when the variance of errors in cost forecast, the <b>risk</b> aversion <b>of</b> the firm and the marginal cost of public funds are larger, while the optimal <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> construction <b>risk</b> will grow when the variance of errors in cost monitoring and the <b>risk</b> aversion <b>of</b> the public authority are large...|$|R

The prospective insured has the equal and opposite advantage of knowing the precise risk proposed to be insured in better detail than the underwriter can ever achieve. Central to English commercial insurance decisions, therefore, are the linked principles that the underwriter is bound {{to the terms of}} his policy; and that the risk is as it has been described to him, and that nothing material to his decision to insure it has been concealed or misrepresented to him.|$|E

50|$|In {{recent years}} the {{operational}} definition of insurance presented {{at the beginning of}} this article proved inadequate as a result of contracts that had the form but not the substance of insurance. The essence of insurance is the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> from the insured to one or more insurers. How much risk a contract actually transfers proved to be at the heart of the controversy. This issue arose most clearly in reinsurance, where the use of Financial Reinsurance to reengineer insurer balance sheets under US GAAP became fashionable during the 1980s. The accounting profession raised serious concerns about the use of reinsurance in which little if any actual risk was transferred, and went on to address the issue in FAS 113, cited above. While on its face, FAS 113 is limited to accounting for reinsurance transactions, the guidance it contains is generally conceded to be equally applicable to US GAAP accounting for insurance transactions executed by commercial enterprises.|$|E

40|$|The present set of {{two studies}} were {{designed}} to investigate {{the quality of the}} mother-child relationship in a sample of mothers and fathers with histories of childhood aggression and social withdrawal, and their at-risk children. In proposing a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk,</b> it was hypothesized that childhood aggression and social withdrawal may affect the quality of emotional availability between mothers and children. Alternatively, the mother-child relationship may be compromised {{as a result of the}} multiple stresses that mothers experience. Participants were recruited from the Concordia Longitudinal Risk Project, a project that began in 1977 when 1, 770 children in Grades 1, 4, or 7, from low SES neighbourhoods, were classified along the dimensions of aggression and social withdrawal. Study 1 focused on the high-risk mothers in the sample. Study 2 focused on the high-risk fathers within which it was possible to compare the quality of parenting and home environments provided by their spouses to the high-risk mothers who participated in Study 1. The interactions of mothers and their children were videotaped in their homes. Mothers completed questionnaires regarding income levels, parenting stress, levels of social support and depressive symptoms. In Study 1, evidence that the quality of emotional availability may be compromised by mother's childhood risk status was found. In particular, mother's childhood aggression in combination with social withdrawal predicted higher levels of hostility. There was also evidence for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> as a result of contextual stresses. Mothers with higher stress levels were found to be less sensitive and more hostile in their interactions with their children. In evaluating the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> to children's cognitive and behavioural functioning both direct and indirect effects of childhood risk factors were found. In Study 2, there was less evidence for the intergenerational <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> as a result of fathers' childhood risk status, or through the quality of their spouses' interactions with their children. In considering pathways for the intergenerational <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk,</b> the results of Study 1, in particular, support the notion that both parenting and environmental variables are important influences in children's development and can confer risk through different mechanisms.
