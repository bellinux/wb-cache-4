The observed frequency of dual and triple infections was higher than would be expected with a random chance of infection. Antibody prevalence rates were similar {{for men and women}} for all three viruses tested, but one of two study sites had significantly higher antibody prevalence to Naples and Sicilian viruses than the other. Individuals with {{antibodies to}} both Naples and <b>Toscana</b> <b>viruses</b> had higher antibody levels to Naples virus than those with antibodies to Naples virus only.

50|$|The {{following}} twelve viruses {{have been}} linked to disease in humans: Alenquer virus, Bhanja virus, Candiru virus, Chagres virus, Naples virus, Punta Toro virus, Rift Valley fever, Sicilian virus, <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus,</b> Uukuniemi virus, Heartland virus (the first tick-borne phlebovirus known to cause disease in the Western Hemisphere, discovered in 2009), and the Sandfly Turkey virus (discovered in China in 2011).They cause symptoms ranging from short self-limiting fevers, such as pappataci fever, to encephalitis and fatal haemorrhagic fever.|$|E
50|$|<b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> (TOSV) is an {{arbovirus}} (arthropod-borne virus) {{belonging to}} Bunyaviridae, {{a family of}} negative-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses. The virus can be transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected sandfly of the genus Phlebotomus. Toscana is not normally associated with disease, as indicated by high seroprevalance rates (up to 25%) in endemic areas, but in common with other sandfly transmitted viruses such as Naples virus and Sicilian virus, infection may result in Pappataci fever, an illness with mild fever, headache and myalgia. In serious cases that go undiagnosed, acute meningitis, meningoencephalitis and encephalitis may occur. There is no specific treatment for infection, so treatment is supportive, reducing the severity of symptoms until the immune system has cleared the infection.|$|E
40|$|<b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} agent responsible for meningitis in central Italy. We report a serosurveillance study, using an immunoenzymatic assay, of 360 serum samples harvested from a high-risk population occupationally exposed to <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> in two regions of Italy, Tuscany and Piedmont. The results indicates a seroprevalence of <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> of 77. 2 % in the forestry workers, particularly in the Tuscany region. This fact is strictly correlated with the ecological niches specific for the survival of <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> arthropod vector...|$|E
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} <b>Toscana</b> (TOS) <b>virus</b> M RNA segment contains a single major open reading frame in the viral-complementary sequence, which can encode a polyprotein of 1339 amino acids. To map the TOS M segment product(s), {{different regions of the}} putative M polypeptide were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, which were purified and inoculated into mice to produce hyperimmune sera. By Western blot analysis, a protein of approximately 30 kDa and two glycoproteins, G 1 and G 2, with the same molecular mass (approximately 65 kDa) were identified in TOS virus-infected cells. The 30 kDa protein, which reacted with antibodies raised to the NH 2 -terminal, was found to be a non-structural protein (designated NSm). By immunoprecipitation analysis of TOS virus-infected cell lysates, both treated or untreated with tunicamycin, the relative positions of glycoproteins G 1 and G 2 were determined. The gene order, with respect to the genomic M RNA, was found to be 3 � NSm-G 1 -G 2 5 �. <b>Toscana</b> (TOS) <b>virus</b> is an enveloped negative-stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome, and belongs to the family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus. It was first isolated in Italy from Phlebotomus perniciosus and P. perfiliewi sandflies (Verani et al., 1984) and from cerebrospinal fluid in patients with central nervous system diseases (Nicoletti et al., 1991). Like other Bunyaviridae, it possesses three genomic segments of ssRNA. The S RNA segment (1869 nucleotides) codes, in an ambisense strategy, for the nucleocapsid protein (N; 27 kDa) and a non-structural protein (NSs; 37 kDa) (Giorgi et al., 1991).

40|$|<b>Toscana</b> {{sandfly fever}} <b>virus</b> (TOSV) is an arthropod-borne virus {{transmitted}} to humans by sandfly vectors. It {{has been associated}} with human cases of meningitis and meningo-encephalitis mainly occurring during the warm season. We performed a retrospective serological study to evaluate TOSV circulation in Palermo, Sicily, and to compare TOSV seroprevalence in patients with neurological symptoms and in a control group of patients without neurological symptoms. When sera from 155 patients with and without neurological symptoms were evaluated, the rate of overall TOSV IgG reactivity was 17. 4 %. Patients with neurological symptoms showed a higher percentage of TOSV IgG positivity than control patients (25 % versus 10. 8 %). TOSV exposure was confirmed by virus neutralization tests which also detected a Naples virus (SFNV) infection. TOSV should be considered as an etiologic agent in the differential diagnosis of fever and meningo-encephalitis in Sicily...|$|R

40|$|Persistent infections were {{established}} by serial undiluted passages of the <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> {{of the genus}} Phlebovirus in Vero cells. Persistence was maintained through more than 70 passages {{over a period of}} 2 years. The persistently infected cells were morphologically similar to the parental Vero cells and released variable amounts of infectious virus. A small percentage of the persistently infected cells produced infectious virus while a larger percentage was shown to possess viral antigens by fluorescent antibody staining. Temperature sensitivity and host cell interferon production were not involved in establishment or maintenance of persistence. The persistently infected cultures were resistant to superinfection with homologous <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus,</b> but they were susceptible to superinfection with heterologous viruses of different genera or families. <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> persistently infected cells showed aselective graded resistance to the replication of other Phleboviruses. Additionally, the virus from persistently infected cells interfered with the replication of standard <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> when they co-infected normal cells.

40|$|<b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> is an {{emerging}} sandfly-borne bunyavirus in Mediterranean Europe responsible for neurological diseases in humans. It {{accounts for about}} 80 % of paediatric meningitis cases during the summer. Despite the important impact of <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> infection-associated disease on human health, currently approved vaccines or effective antiviral treatments are not available. In this research, we have analyzed the effect of bovine lactoferrin, a bi-globular iron-binding glycoprotein with potent antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, on <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> infection in vitro. Our results showed that lactoferrin was capable of inhibiting <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> replication in a dose-dependent manner. Results obtained when lactoferrin {{was added to the}} cells during different phases of viral infection showed that lactoferrin was able to prevent viral replication when added during the viral adsorption step or during the entire cycle of virus infection, demonstrating that its action takes place in an early phase of viral infection. In particular, our results demonstrated that the anti-Toscana virus action of lactoferrin took place on virus attachment to the cell membrane, mainly through a competition for common glycosaminoglycan receptors. These findings provide further insights on the antiviral activity of bovine lactoferrin...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{meningitis}} is {{the most}} common neurologic disease that involves the central nervous system. The spectrum of infectious agents that cause neurologic infection is remarkably broad and numerous viruses are the most frequent cause of the aseptic meningitis syndrome. We applied a multiplex one-step method for the rapid detection of the genomic RNA of different neurotropic viruses: particles in the genus Enterovirus and <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus,</b> which are the most representative aetiologic agents in our country during the spring-summer period. We have evaluated the sensitivity and the specificity of the multiplex one-step test on positive controls and on RNA extracted from clinical samples harvested from 475 patients with meningitis hospitalized during the 1996 - 2001 period. The multiplex one-step RT-nPCR protocol allows for the detection of enterovirus and <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> RNA in a single sample, by using, at the same time, a very small clinical sample volume.

40|$|The <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> (family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus) is {{the only}} sandfly-transmitted virus that {{demonstrates}} neurotropic activity. Clinical cases ranging from aseptic meningitis to meningoencephalitis caused by <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> are yearly observed in central Italy during the summer, and several cases have been reported among tourists returning from zones of endemicity (Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Cyprus). In <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> patients, immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies, usually present {{at the onset of}} symptoms, can reveal elevated titers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and can persist for at least 1 year. IgG antibodies can be absent at the onset of symptoms: titers rise in convalescent sera and persist for many years. At least five proteins have been identified in Toscana virus-infected cells: nucleoprotein N, glycoproteins G 1 and G 2, a large protein (L) assumed to be a component of the polymerase, and two nonstructural proteins, NSm and NSs. We report results of a study on the antibody response to individual viral proteins in patients with Toscana virus-associated acute neurologic disease. Immunoblotting and semiquantitative radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) allow identification of nucleoprotein N as the major antigen responsible for both IgM and IgG responses. Antibodies to proteins other than nucleoprotein N are detected only by RIPA. Antibodies to glycoproteins are detected in about one-third of patients, and whereas their presence always predicts neutralization, some serum samples with neutralizing activity have undetectable levels of antibodies to G 1 -G 2. Antibodies to nonstructural proteins NSm and NSs are also identified.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Elderly {{patients}} {{have a long}} list of differentials for causes of acute confusion and altered consciousness levels, including infectious agents. In addition, elderly, retired patients often have more time to travel for tourism, particularly to exotic, warmer locations. Mediterranean countries such as Spain and Italy are popular holiday destinations for British and other tourists, especially during the winter months. However, these warm climates allow insect vectors to proliferate, increasing the risk of exposure to endemic vectorborne viral infections whilst on vacation. Such infections may not be routinely considered by geriatric medical teams. CASE PRESENTATION: An 87 -year old gentleman presented with a three-day history of worsening confusion, lethargy, ataxia, and fevers following a trip to Spain, where he may have sustained a sandfly bite. By the time of admission, he had a reduced GCS, was hallucinating, and was incontinent of urine and faeces, though blood pressure and heart rate were normal. He also appeared hyperaesthetic, and found even capillary blood sugar testing extremely painful. He had no history of cognitive defect or other neurological conditions. He had been previously independently active, with frequent trips to Spain where he maintained a holiday home. He probably sustained a sandfly bite during this most recent trip, whilst cleaning out a shed. Acute and convalescent sera demonstrated IgG antibodies to <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> at extremely high titres of ≥ 1 : 10, 000 by immunofluorescence assay, though no <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> RNA was detectable in these sera by the time of presentation. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> {{should be included in the}} differential diagnosis of any patients presenting with meningo-encephalitis who have recently returned from a Mediterranean country. Testing for <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> infection is performed by serological testing on acute/convalescent paired sera, and/or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay on blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) if presenting within 5  days of illness onset. Making a diagnosis of <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> meningitis/encephalitis (where no other pathogen is detected) has additional clinical utility in reducing or preventing unnecessary use of antibiotics, as well as reassuring the patient and family that generally, this illness is generally self-limiting and full recovery within a few weeks is expected, as in the case reported here.

40|$|Background: Our aim is {{to detect}} the {{infection}} by <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus</b> (TOSV) and other Phleboviruses in the sera and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) of patients with meningitis in Tunisia. We examined various species of phlebotomus present in Tunisia {{to determine whether or}} not a direct relationship exists between cases of meningitis and the viruses circulating in the insect vectors. Methods: Patients with the meningeal syndrome were tested for anti-TOSV IgM and IgG using an indirect Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and for the presence of TOSV and other Phleboviruses using a RT-PCR test. An entomological study was carried out using CDC light traps to trap sandflies in different bioclimatic zones of Tunisia. Collected sandflies were tested by RT-PCR for the presence of TOSV and other Phleboviruses and subsequently by viral isolation on Vero cells. Results: Of 263 patients were tested using ELISA of which 12. 16 % (n = 32 / 263) were IgM positive for anti TOSV. Of these 32 patients, 78 % (n = 25 / 32) were IgG positive. 12. 86 % (n = 18 / 140) of the CSF samples tested by RT-PCR were positive for the <b>Toscana</b> <b>virus.</b> One CSF sample tested by RT-PCR revealed the presence of Sandfly Fever Sicilian Virus (SFSV).
