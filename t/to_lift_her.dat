5|$|The TNA Women's Knockout Championship was {{defended by}} Awesome Kong, who was {{accompanied}} by Raisha Saeed, against ODB in a match lasting six minutes and fifty-four seconds. During the match, Kong was positioned {{on the top of}} a padded turnbuckle which allowed ODB <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> off and perform a powerbomb gaining a near-fall. Afterwards, Saeed stood on the ring apron to distract ODB, allowing Kong to perform her signature Awesome Bomb maneuver and gain the pinfall to retain the TNA Women's Knockout Championship.|$|E
5|$|When Pearl {{is called}} to assist with an attack by a super villain, she is unable to prevent the death of several police officers. Distraught, Pearl seeks solitude, but Jennifer finds her and tries <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> spirits. Jennifer reminds Pearl about her own fortune, and claims that their two {{fortunes}} are related. Jennifer reveals her romantic feelings for Pearl and kisses her. Pearl is too shocked to respond.|$|E
5|$|Despite some claims, {{such as that}} by the {{historian}} Max von Boehm, that the largest crinolines measured up to ten yards (30feet) around, the photohistorian Alison Gernsheim concluded that the maximum realistic circumference was in fact between five-and-a-half and six yards. Whilst a loosely gathered skirt draped over a large hoop would certainly require a higher yardage, Gernsheim noted that ten yard hems were highly improbable. Staged photographs showing women wearing exaggeratedly large crinolines were quite popular, such as a widely published sequence of five stereoscope views showing a woman dressing {{with the assistance of}} several maids who require long poles <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> dress over her head and other ingenious means of navigating her enormous hoopskirt. Such photographs, which re-enacted contemporary caricatures rather than accurately reflecting reality, were aimed towards the voyeur's market. However, it was a fact that the size of the crinoline often caused difficulties in passing through doors, boarding carriages and generally moving about. By the late 1860s many crinolines were of a significantly reduced size, as noted by a Victoria and Albert Museum curator observing the sizes of cage crinolines in the Museum's collection.|$|E

25|$|The Prior again {{demands that}} Alaide reveal her identity, but she refuses. However, she does agree <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> veil for the Prior alone and he gasps upon seeing her face. Immediately, he sends her away with Valdeburgo. Arturo is left alone, while the Prior chastises Osburgo for his false {{testimony}} against Alaide, stating that his actions will be watched.|$|E
25|$|Pippi is red-haired, freckled, {{unconventional}} and superhumanly strong – able <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> horse one-handed. She is {{playful and}} unpredictable. She often {{makes fun of}} unreasonable adults, {{especially if they are}} pompous and condescending. Her anger comes out in extreme cases, such as when a man ill-treats his horse. Pippi, like Peter Pan, does not want to grow up. She is the daughter of a buccaneer captain and has adventure stories to tell about that too. Her four best friends are her horse and monkey, and the neighbours' children, Tommy and Annika.|$|E
25|$|Priscilla Tirado was {{too weak}} to grab the line when the {{helicopter}} returned to her. A watching bystander, Congressional Budget Office assistant Lenny Skutnik, stripped off his coat and boots, and in short sleeves, dove into the icy water and swam out to successfully pull her to shore. The helicopter then proceeded to where Felch had fallen, and paramedic Gene Windsor stepped out onto the helicopter skid and grabbed her by the clothing <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> onto the skid with him, bringing her to shore. When the helicopter crew returned for Williams, the wreckage he was strapped into had rolled slightly, submerging him—according to the coroner, Williams was the only passenger to die by drowning. His body and those of the other occupants were later recovered.|$|E

25|$|Sue grows {{disillusioned with}} cheerleading, {{and in an}} effort to {{recapture}} her love for it, plans to fire cheerleader Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) from a cannon during the team's next competitive routine. Brittany and her friends Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) and Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) ultimately quit the squad, which loses at Regionals after having won the national title for six straight years. Sue is named Loser of the Year in a televised interview with Katie Couric, and has her budget slashed. Depressed, Sue stages a fake suicide, and as she hoped would happen, is convinced to temporarily join the glee club <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> spirits, though she really wants to bring down the club from within. When her attempts to do so fail, Sue decides to become the coach of Aural Intensity, one of New Directions' Regionals competitors, and deliberately injures their director {{in order to get the}} job. Sue is furious when her club loses to New Directions, and punches the announcer in the face.|$|E
25|$|Kvitová started 2009 impressively by {{reaching}} her first ever final, at the Moorilla Hobart International, having defeated Sally Peers, Alona Bondarenko, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, Virginie Razzano en route. There, she defeated compatriot Iveta Benešová <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> maiden career title. After suffering consecutive winless appearances at the Australian Open, the Open GDF Suez and the Dubai Tennis Championships, {{she reached the}} third round in Indian Wells, losing to eventual champion Vera Zvonareva. She then withdrew from the French Open due to an ankle injury and then bowed {{out in the first}} round of Wimbledon. At the US Open, she defeated then-world no. 1 Dinara Safina in the third round in three sets for her first win over a reigning world no. 1. Kvitová was ranked 71 places lower than Safina at the time. However, she came up short to eventual semifinalist Yanina Wickmayer in the round of 16 in three sets. At the Generali Ladies Linz, Kvitová made her second final of the year, where she lost to Wickmayer once again. She concluded 2009 as world No. 62.|$|E
25|$|Tiffany, Pat, {{and their}} friends and family arrive at the {{competition}} {{on the night of}} the football game. Tiffany despairs when she finds that Nikki actually is in the audience, invited by Ronnie and Veronica who want Nikki <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> restraining order on Pat and give Pat the chance to reconcile with her. Tiffany walks to the bar and starts drinking. Pat finds her moments before their dance and drags her onto the dance floor. They begin their routine as the Eagles defeat the Dallas Cowboys. At the conclusion of their set, Tiffany and Pat score exactly 5 points. Amid cheers from friends and family and confused looks from the crowd, Pat approaches Nikki and speaks quietly into her ear. Tiffany sees this and runs off. Pat leaves Nikki behind after a short conversation, and chases Tiffany. He hands her a letter, in which he admits that he knows she forged Nikki's letter and confesses that he loved her from the moment he met her, though it took him so long to come to terms with it. They share a kiss. Patrizio opens a restaurant with the money he has won, Danny grows even closer to the Solitanos, and Pat and Tiffany begin a relationship, no longer wearing their wedding rings.|$|E

Montana {{is attempting to}} explain the scenario to Osment's character, saying, [...] "I'll {{make it up to}} you, I promise." [...] Then Truscott (Osment) says, [...] "You will never make this up to me." [...] Montana is being overwhelmed by fans, which proceed <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> to a stage and perform the song. Throughout most of the video Cyrus' character performs the song with background dancers, a band, and Steve Rushton on the electric guitar. In the conclusion, Rico Suave, portrayed by Moises Arias, emerges from a massive birthday cake that explodes on the crowd.|$|E
500|$|After her cheerleading squad loses a {{competition}} {{for the first time}} in seven years, coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) becomes depressed, and stages an apparent suicide by [...] "overdosing" [...] on gummy vitamins. Her colleague, school guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), suggests that she temporarily join the school glee club, New Directions, <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> spirits. Hoping to create discord within the group, Sue pits members Mercedes (Amber Riley) and Rachel (Lea Michele) against one another. Her plan backfires when a duet between the two results in a deepening of their respect for one another vocally. In an attempt to bring out the good in Sue, club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) takes her to a pediatric cancer ward, where they sing [...] "This Little Light of Mine" [...] with the patients.|$|E
500|$|Glatton {{remained}} in Dover Harbour, an obstruction to shipping, with her hull visible {{at low tide}} as the Harbour Board could not afford the £45,000 quoted on average by salvage companies. Work finally began in May 1925 as some [...] of silt were removed from underneath Glatton and her mainmast and superstructure were blasted away. All the holes on her topside had to be sealed and air pumped into each compartment {{at a rate of}} [...] per minute to restore her buoyancy. The first attempt <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> began on 2 December 1925 and was successful in breaking the suction holding her to the bottom in combination with the rising tide. Slowly she was moved, taking advantage of the tides, until on 16 March 1926 she was moved to a deep gully next to the western pier of the submarine harbour, close by the shore. The total cost was considerably more than originally estimated, but still far less than that quoted by the salvage companies, at no more than £12,000. There she remains, buried by landfill underneath the current car ferry terminal. Her bell was salvaged and is on display at the Harbour Board offices.|$|E

500|$|While under construction, Popov's {{design was}} {{modified}} {{by the addition}} of wood and copper sheathing to reduce biofouling, which increased Novgorods diameter to [...] She had a maximum draught of [...] and displaced [...] at normal load. Freeboard was only [...] and the deck curved upwards to the gun barbette in the center. The ship had an unarmoured superstructure forward of the barbette that housed some of the crew's quarters. Despite initial concerns about her sea-keeping ability, Novgorod was a stable gun platform and had an easy roll that rarely exceeded 7–8°. Her bluff hull form meant that she lost speed in heavy weather and, on one occasion in 1877, lost all [...] during a Force eight storm. In some conditions the ship could pitch enough <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> propellers out of the water. The biggest drawback to her hull shape was that it greatly reduced the rudder's ability to turn the ship by masking much of the flow of water so much that it took 40–45 minutes to make a full circle and the ship was almost unsteerable in a severe storm. The solution adopted was to use the engines for steering and leave the rudder fixed, even though this reduced the ship's speed. She had a crew of 151 officers and ratings.|$|E
500|$|Glatton {{remained}} in Dover Harbour, an obstruction to shipping, with her hull visible {{at low tide}} as the Harbour Board could not afford the £45,000 quoted on average by salvage companies. Finally they asked the Harbourmaster, Captain John Iron, if {{he could do it}} for less. He estimated it would cost about £5,000 if he was granted use of the salvage craft already at Dover. The Board accepted his offer and work began in May 1925. Some [...] of silt were removed from underneath Glatton and her mainmast and superstructure were blasted away from the wreck. Four lifting lighters, with a capacity of , were hired, but they would not suffice to lift a water-logged [...] ship. It was necessary to seal all of the holes on her topside and pump air into each compartment at a rate of [...] per minute to restore her buoyancy. The first attempt <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> began on 2 December 1925 and was successful in breaking the suction holding her to the bottom in combination with the rising tide. That was enough for the first try and the major lifting effort began the following day. Slowly she was moved, taking advantage of the tides, until on 16 March 1926 she was moved to a deep gully next to the western pier of the submarine harbour, close by the shore.

Stan meets Jim James, who, after being freaked out by Stan, points out the flaws in his logic and tells {{him that he could}} not possibly be writing his songs just for him, seeing as how they never knew each other, and that Francine is the one who truly understands him. The episode ends with Francine and Stan rekindling their passion for each other (still in Jim James's dressing room) with the female security guard coming in the room to join them, closing the door behind her.|$|R

Jerdy told Laura Heffernan (Inside Soap) that ultimately Grace views them as her [...] "little annoying brothers" [...] who have never had any time for her. They give her a cosmetic make-over and begin <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> mood. Liam and Jesse soon plot to steal Trevor's life insurance to repay money they owe Adam. Jerdy told Kilkelly that Jesse and Liam were influenced by Adam's estranged relationship with Grace. They had a problematic dynamic and his negative stories about Grace clouded their judgement. Jerdy believed that Jesse feels guilty about the scam {{because he is the}} first brother to care about Grace. He noted that Liam has a [...] "colder" [...] personality and does not feel any remorse for trying to scam his sister.|$|E
2500|$|In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, Kitana is fought as a boss {{character}} {{twice during}} the game's main story mode {{and one of}} unlockable player characters for the versus mode. Besides the [...] "Kiss of Death", her other most common Fatality is an execution through decapitation with a fan, which has been featured in almost all of her game appearances (except of Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance and Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe) and is expanded in Mortal Kombat 2011 where she cuts off the defeated opponents' arms before beheading them. Most of Kitana's traditional special moves utilize her twin fan weapons, used as a melee weapon, as a thrown projectile, and <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> enemies in the air. In the early 1990s, there was a popular but completely false rumor regarding a supposed [...] "Nudality" [...] or [...] "Sexuality" [...] finishing move for Kitana and Mileena. In later games, Kitana received some special moves that have been typically associated with Mileena, such as a ground-roll attack in vs. DC Universe and teleportation-based moves since Shaolin Monks. Like all playable characters in Mortal Kombat X, Kitana has three different style variations to choose from in this game, including her [...] "Mournful" [...] variation using Jade's special attacks such as [...] "Shadow Kick" [...] and weapons. Her other MKX styles are the aggressive, fast and acrobatic [...] "Assassin", and the defensively-oriented [...] "Royal Storm", which expands on her fan-lifting abilities.|$|E
