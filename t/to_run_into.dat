5|$|In {{the next}} match, Orlando Jordan faced Chris Benoit for the United States Championship. During the match, Jordan removed the top {{turnbuckle}} pad. Benoit attempted to slam Jordan but Jordan avoided {{the attack and}} instead forced Benoit <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> the exposed turnbuckle. Jordan scored the pin to win the match and retain the title.|$|E
5|$|The {{first state}} highway through St. Ignace was an {{extension}} of US31 that was added {{by the end of}} 1927. In 1936, US2 was realigned <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> downtown St. Ignace from the west and replaced US31 through town. The business loop was commissioned in 1960 when the I-75/US2 freeway opened, and the former route of US2 through downtown was renumbered BL I-75.|$|E
5|$|The group quickly realizes {{they are}} outnumbered, {{and they all}} attempt to escape to safety. Patricia (Jane McNeill) is killed as walkers {{overtake}} the Greene household, and Rick convinces Hershel to abandon his property {{as it is a}} lost cause. Everyone escapes in groups, except for Andrea (Laurie Holden), who was separated from the others. Unknown to them, she manages to escape the farm, only <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> a mysterious hooded figure who has two armless walker pets and wields a katana.|$|E

5|$|According to Nathan Fillion, {{there was}} an episode in which the crew land on a dying planet. The {{inhabitants}} try to steal Serenity, after they explain to the crew about their need {{to get off the}} planet. The problem is that unless they were <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> another ship along the way, with the extra passengers, Serenity would not have enough fuel and oxygen {{to make it to the}} closest destination. While everyone else is asleep, Mal takes the ship himself and discovers that help never would have arrived.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1936, {{the last}} section of US31 in the state was paved near Charlevoix, making the entire highway in Michigan a hard-surfaced road. Early the next year, the route of US2 was realigned <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> St. Ignace; after the change, US2 and US31 ran concurrently. Later that year, a set of curves were {{straightened}} out south of Ludington and the routes of US31 and a US31A between Saugatuck and Holland were switched, and US31 was realigned to bypass downtown Ludington.|$|E
5|$|Christian Cage fought Monty Brown next to {{determine}} the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. This bout lasted 12 minutes and 32 seconds. In the beginning the two fought at ringside, until Cage jumped {{from the top of}} a padded turnbuckle onto Brown with an aerial splash. After this, Cage removed the padding from one of the turnbuckles. Brown gained a two-count on Cage after slamming him against the mat with his signature Alpha Bomb maneuver and covered for the pin, but the referee had a delayed reaction. Later, Cage caused Brown <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> the exposed turnbuckle, he then followed by forcing Brown's face into the mat with his signature Unprettier maneuver. He then pinned Brown to become the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

5|$|Later, Morales and Ramsey {{receive a}} report about a stolen car {{that matches the}} one from the Turner and Cook murders. While {{investigating}} a sand pit, they encounter the Phantom. Morales shoots at him but misses, causing him <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> the woods. The Phantom escapes by jumping past a moving train, but is shot in the leg. While the officers {{are waiting for the}} train to pass, the Phantom escapes. They continue their search, but never find him. Years later during the Christmas season of 1976, the film The Town That Dreaded Sundown premieres in Texarkana and the shoes of the Phantom are seen on someone standing in line.|$|E
5|$|The Wensleydale Railway {{is reached}} by a bus service, {{operated}} by Dales & District, which runs from Northallerton {{to the current}} terminus of the railway at Leeming Bar, from where trains run to Redmire. It is hoped that eventually passenger trains will connect with the Settle-Carlisle Railway at Garsdale, and that the section of line near Northallerton known as the South Curve can be upgraded to allow trains from Wensleydale <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> Northallerton railway station without reversing onto the main line. At the moment there are some limited goods, engineering and excursion trains using the North Curve.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{pay-per-view}} {{opened with}} the Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) taking on Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster). The Legion of Doom used {{their size and}} power to wear down their opponents in the opening minutes of the match. Money Inc. gained the advantage when Hawk missed a flying clothesline. Hawk tried to tag in his partner but was unable for several minutes because Money Inc. kept {{him away from the}} corner where Animal was standing. Eventually, Hawk and Schyster hit each other at the same time. Hawk tagged Animal in, and the Legion of Doom attempted the Doomsday device, their signature move. Schyster stopped them, but Animal hit Schyster in retaliation, causing Schyster <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> DiBiase. Animal then powerslammed DiBiase and pinned him to get the victory.|$|E

5|$|The city centre, {{dating from}} the Middle Ages, lies {{on a series of}} clay banks between the former streams of Vesterå and Lilleå, which used <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> the sound. Despite {{effective}} drainage, the main streets, including Algade, still run east to west while the side streets run north to south. The Budolfi Church and the old town hall line Gammeltorv, the old market square. The main shopping streets are Algade and Bispengade, the latter lying inbetween the modern Vesterbro thoroughfare and Nytorv square. Østerågade, once the old harbor, is noted for its merchants' mansions.|$|E
5|$|The project {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> {{difficulties with}} malfunctions, financial problems and threats of work stoppages. New letters patent were issued on 12 August 1779 that doubled the rates and extended the term to ninety-nine years. The concessionary could now also expropriate land for shops, warehouses and housing for employees. The work was complete in May 1780 and was finally opened for navigation from Givors to Rive-de-Gier the following December. The concessionaries {{reported that they}} had spent six million francs, but the canal probably cost much more.|$|E
5|$|The tour started poorly for Harvey. In five {{innings in}} the first three weeks, he scored only 36 runs at 7.20, and this {{included}} a ten-wicket defeat at the hands of Laker and Lock's Surrey. It was Australia's first loss to a county side since 1912. Harvey began <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> some form after that, scoring 45 against Cambridge University before the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which fielded a virtual England Test team in what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests. Harvey made 225 in Australia's 413 and the hosts made 9/203 to draw the match. However, he was unable to replicate this form in the Tests.|$|E

5|$|The {{winners of}} the 1910 Gordon Bennett Cup, Alan R. Hawley and Augustus Post, set a {{distance}} and duration record of 1,173 miles in 44 hours and 25 minutes, but the pair of experienced balloonists landed in a remote section of Canadian wilderness in Quebec. After a week passed with no word from the team, search parties were formed by the Aero Club of America, but many newspapers reported that the men were likely dead. Instead they emerged after ten days, assisted by two local trappers who had been out on a hunting trip and happened <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> them. Hawley had injured a knee, but otherwise the pair were unharmed and received a hero's welcome upon their safe return.|$|E
5|$|Hotchkiss driver Elliott Shepard, who {{finished}} {{the first day}} in fourth, less than four minutes behind Nazzaro, spent half-an-hour working on his car {{at the start of}} the second day, fitting new tyres and changing liquids. On the eighth lap, he ran off the wooden planking at Saint-Calais but was able to resume; a wheel failure later in the lap caused him <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> a bank of earth and forced him to retire. Panhard driver Georges Teste crashed early in the day and retired, as did Claude Richez of Renault; the sole Gobron-Brillié of Rigolly suffered radiator damage on lap seven and was forced out of the race. After two laps' running on the second day, second-placed Clément had established a 23-minute lead over Nazzaro, but this was reduced to three minutes on the following lap. Despite Nazzaro passing Clément on lap ten, a refuelling stop for the FIAT soon after put Clément back in front. Nazzaro passed again, and led Clément into the last lap of the race by less than a minute.|$|E
5|$|In an {{alternate}} story line, Nemo admits to Anna he cannot swim; the two spend time together {{and fall in}} love. Anna {{turns out to be}} Harry's daughter and the two step siblings begin an illicit affair. They pledge their lives to one another. When Harry and Nemo's mother break up, Anna goes to New York with her father, and they lose touch. Years later, Nemo works as a pool cleaner, hoping <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> Anna by chance. They finally see one another at the train station and immediately recognize each other in a crowd of passers-by. After a passionate reunion, Anna announces she is not ready to immediately resume the relationship. She gives him her number, asks him to call her in two days and meet at the lighthouse. However, he loses her number when a sudden downpour makes her note illegible. Nemo waits at the lighthouse every day, but Anna does not come.|$|E

5|$|Milan won the toss and Liverpool kicked off. Playing in a 4–2–3–1 formation, {{they had}} the first attack of the match, but Jermaine Pennant could not reach Steven Gerrard's cross-field pass. Milan responded with two low {{attempts}} on the Liverpool goal, but Jamie Carragher was able to clear them both. The second clearance led to a corner, from which Milan failed to score. Liverpool had the first chance of the match in the ninth minute. A slip from Milan defender Marek Jankulovski allowed Pennant <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> space, he passed the ball to Dirk Kuyt who passed it back to him, Pennant's subsequent shot was saved by Milan goalkeeper Dida. Minutes later Gerrard won a header which found Pennant, however Gerrard was unable to make decent contact with the ball following Pennant's pass. Milan had their first shot of the match a few minutes later. Kaká received the ball outside the area and moved to his right before shooting, however Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina saved the shot. Liverpool continued to exert pressure leading Milan defender Massimo Oddo to mis-read a cross from Pennant, the ball reached Gerrard whose shot went over the goal.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill founded Geostar Corporation {{to develop}} a {{satellite}} position determination system {{for which he was}} granted a patent in 1982. The system, primarily intended to track aircraft, was called Radio Determination Satellite Service (RDSS). In April 1983 Geostar applied to the FCC for a license to broadcast from three satellites, which would cover the entire United States. Geostar launched GSTAR-2 into geosynchronous orbit in 1986. Its transmitter package permanently failed two months later, so Geostar began tests of RDSS by transmitting from other satellites. With his health failing, O'Neill became less involved with the company {{at the same time it}} started <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> trouble. In February 1991 Geostar filed for bankruptcy and its licenses were sold to Motorola for the Iridium satellite constellation project. Although the system was eventually replaced by GPS, O'Neill made significant advances in the field of position determination.|$|E
5|$|The column had yet <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> any American troops {{when they}} reached Howard's Tavern (also known as Howard's Half-Way House), {{just a few hundred}} yards from the Jamaica Pass. Tavern keeper William Howard and his son William Jr. were forced to act as guides to show the British the way to the Rockaway Foot Path, an old Indian trail that skirted the Jamaica Pass to the west (located today in the Cemetery of the Evergreens). Five minutes after leaving the tavern, the five American militia {{officers}} stationed at the pass were captured without a shot fired, as they thought that the British were Americans. Clinton interrogated the men and they informed him that they were the only troops guarding the pass. By dawn, the British were through the pass and stopped so that the troops could rest. At 09:00, they fired two heavy cannons to signal the Hessian troops below Battle Pass to begin their frontal assault against Sullivan's men deployed on the two hills flanking the pass, while Clinton's troops simultaneously flanked the American positions from the east.|$|E
