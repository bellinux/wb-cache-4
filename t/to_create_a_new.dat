The new archdiocese included the sees of Worcester, Hereford, Leicester, Lindsey, Dommoc, and Elmham; these were essentially the midland Anglian territories. Canterbury retained the sees {{in the south and}} southeast. Hygeberht, already Bishop of Lichfield, was the new archdiocese's first and only archbishop.|$|E

5|$|In late 2005 the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) {{threatened}} action {{over the}} holding in captivity of Mercedes, then Britain's only polar bear. The zoo had initially planned to retire their polar bear exhibit after Mercedes died. When zoo officials announced plans <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> attraction, citing {{their responsibility to}} ensure {{the survival of the}} species, the ALF threatened damage to zoo workers' property and other scare-tactics. Edinburgh's treatment of polar bears had often been subject to criticism, punctuated by incidents like the death in 1997 of Mercedes' partner Barney, who choked on a plastic child's toy thrown into his enclosure. In 2009 the zoo carried out their plans <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> exhibit and improve conditions for Mercedes, moving her to the Highland Wildlife Park, where she was joined by a young male polar bear named Walker. Mercedes was euthanized on compassionate grounds in 2011, suffering from severe arthritis.|$|E

5|$|According to {{management}} researcher John J. Clancey, scientific management can involve {{the use of}} throffers. While piecework had been utilised since the Middle Ages, Frederick Winslow Taylor blended rationalised management with piecework, <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> system. Productivity processes were standardised, after which point managers were able to present a throffer to workers: higher pay was offered if {{they were able to}} exceed the standard, while lower pay was threatened for any who did not meet expectations.|$|E

5|$|By 1929, the {{phenomenon}} of beta decay prompted Bohr to again suggest that the law of conservation of energy be abandoned, but Enrico Fermi's hypothetical neutrino and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the neutron provided another explanation. This prompted Bohr <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> theory of the compound nucleus in 1936, which explained how neutrons could be captured by the nucleus. In this model, the nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid. He worked on this with a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{health effects}} from {{volcanic}} ash fall are possible, as exposure to free crystalline silica {{is known to}} cause silicosis. Minerals associated with this include quartz, cristobalite and tridymite, which may all be present in volcanic ash. These minerals are described as ‘free’ silica as the SiO2 is not attached to another element <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> mineral. However, magmas containing less than 58% SiO2 {{are thought to be}} unlikely to contain crystalline silica.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, plans arose <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> highway link {{on the south}} side of Lake Simcoe to connect Highway400 and Highway12.

It was to follow 11th Line from Highway400 east to the Holland Marsh, where it would cross towards the northeast onto the alignment of Ravenshoe Road (York Road32).

5|$|In 1960 Newman {{devised a}} thriller series for ABC called Police Surgeon, {{starring}} Ian Hendry.

Debuting in January 1961, The Avengers became an international success, although in later years its premise differed somewhat from Newman's initial set-up, veering into more humorous territory rather than remaining a gritty thriller.|$|E
