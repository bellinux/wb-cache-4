50|$|This tragedy {{reinforced}} Bachem's {{long held}} {{belief that the}} take-off and flight {{in the vicinity of}} the target bombers should be fully automated. The canopy latch was strengthened and the headrest was attached to the backboard of the cockpit. Before the introduction of the autopilot in the test programme, the control column would have a <b>temporary</b> <b>locking</b> device on it, which would allow the machine to ascend vertically to at least 1,000 m and then be removed by the pilot. The Walter motor probably ceased operation because the Natter was virtually upside-down and air may have entered the intake pipes in the propellant tanks, starving the motor. Sieber had become the first man to take off vertically from the ground under pure rocket power, some 16 years before Yuri Gagarin's Vostok 1 pioneering, peacetime orbital flight.|$|E

50|$|Immediately {{south-east}} of {{the village}} the canal crosses {{the valley of the}} river Great Ouse on an embankment and aqueduct known as the Cosgrove Iron Trunk Aqueduct. The river was initially crossed on the level, with four <b>temporary</b> <b>locks</b> lowering the canal from the south-east, and five raising it from the river towards the north-west (the top lock of these is still in place). The <b>temporary</b> <b>locks</b> were used as a means of getting the canal open to through traffic by 1800 (this river crossing and the tunnel at Blisworth being the only two gaps by that year). However, it was always intended that the river should be crossed by aqueduct, as the locks were wasteful of water, time-consuming and the river in flood in winter could prevent through passage. A brick aqueduct was built, but collapsed in 1808, after which the locks were re-opened. It was replaced by the present Cosgrove aqueduct, built of cast iron, and opened on 22 January 1811.|$|R
5000|$|The Baillie-Grohman canal {{was only}} {{a little over a}} mile long, but it was in such poor {{condition}} that it took two weeks to coax North Star through it. The brush had overgrown the canal and the water was shallow causing the steamer to scrape bottom. At one point, a tree fell onto the steamer, just missing Armstrongs young daughter Ruth (for whom his steamer Ruth had been named). When North Star came to the lock, Armstrong solved the width problem by simply sawing 5 or 6 inches off the guards (the thick timber running along the top outside edge of a sternwheelers hull). The length problem was solved differently. In those days, ore was packed out of mines in the Kootenay country by stuffing oxhides full of the mineral, and dragging or sliding the filled hides to the nearest steamboat landing or rail depot. Anderson had a number of oxhides on board North Star and he had them filled with sand and piled up to form <b>temporary</b> <b>lock</b> gates. He then destroyed the existing gates, and when the North Star was between the pair of <b>temporary</b> <b>lock</b> gates, he blew the forward temporary gates out with dynamite, and the steamer surged forward with the rush of water into {{the lower part of the}} canal.|$|R

500|$|The last ship ever to {{pass through}} the canal and one of the last on the Kootenay was the North Star, also piloted by Captain Armstrong. In 1902, Armstrong decided to take North Star to sail on the Columbia instead, finding {{business}} on the Kootenay less and less profitable as the mines in the region played out, as the CPR established its Kootenay Central Railway branch, and for a variety of other reasons. In June of that year, Armstrong took North Star to the Baillie-Grohman Canal, which was in decrepit condition. The lock was also too small to accommodate the vessel. Armstrong had two makeshift dams built to create a <b>temporary</b> <b>lock</b> [...] long, and then the forward dam was blown up so the ship could ride the surge of water ahead into Columbia Lake. The transit of North Star to Columbia Lake was the last time the canal was ever used by a steamboat and marked the end of the steamboat era on the Kootenay.|$|R
25|$|The Oxford Canal {{had been}} built by James Brindley and carried coal to large parts of {{southern}} England. However it did not provide a sufficiently direct route between the Midlands and London. As a result, a new canal was proposed to run from the Oxford Canal at Braunston, near Rugby, and to end at the Thames at Brentford, a length of ninety miles. Jessop was appointed Chief Engineer to the Canal Company in 1793. The canal was especially difficult to plan because, whereas other canals tended to follow river valleys and only crossed a watershed when unavoidable, the new canal had to cross the rivers Ouse, Nene and others. An aqueduct was built at Wolverton to carry the canal across the Ouse valley. Whilst the three-arch stone aqueduct was being built, a set of nine <b>temporary</b> <b>locks</b> were used to carry the canal down {{one side of the}} valley and up the other. The aqueduct failed in 1808, and was replaced by an iron one in 1811, the iron trough design sharing a similar structure to the aqueduct at Longdon-on-Tern and the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct built by Thomas Telford. It is known as the Cosgrove aqueduct and was designed and built by Bevan.|$|R
40|$|The Maximum a Posteriori Ambiguity Search (MAPAS) {{method for}} GPS {{ambiguity}} resolution first introduced in [8], is generalized to accommodate: (1) satellite switches caused by satellites rising or falling {{below the horizon}} or obstructing terrain, and (2) cycle slips due to <b>temporary</b> loss of <b>lock</b> on satellite signals. It is shown that MAPAS and generalized MAPAS are equivalent to Bayesian estimation. The generalized MAPAS method is successfully applied to real GPS satellite data with cycle slips and satellite switches due to satellite obstruction...|$|R

50|$|Building on its {{ruling in}} Buffalo Linen Supply Co., the Supreme Court held in American Ship Building v.

50|$|Rainbow Tickets is a PASELI-Purchasable Item (similar to PENDUALâ€™s Time Hourglass) {{which was}} {{available}} on November 26, 2015. The {{effect of this}} ticket would <b>temporary</b> unlock any <b>locked</b> songs in PENDUAL and copula (with the exception of some songs), and the LEGGENDARIA folder songs (which was otherwise only available on EXTRA Stage in PASELI pay mode) for only one session of gameplay. Tickets also give boosts to unlocks when used in any Unlocking Events. Note that the Rainbow Tickets will not work on any past event-unlock songs from tricoro and SPADA, as these songs are regularly unlocked. Rainbow Tickets has a validity of 60 days upon purchase. The tickets will all be sold out on October 19, 2016, with the tickets expires on October 26, 2016.|$|R
2500|$|It {{joins the}} Peak Forest Canal {{on the eastern}} edge of Marple, {{at the top of a}} flight of 16 locks that raise the lower Peak Forest by [...] to join the upper section. There was once a Stop Lock at Marple, {{although}} both canals were built to the same level, and the lock was provided only for cases where water shortages might have resulted in a <b>temporary</b> difference. The <b>lock</b> has long been de-gated, having become unnecessary once the Macclesfield and Peak Forest canals came into common ownership. The site of the lock remains as a narrows just in front of the junction bridge, and is overlooked by a canal warehouse with two storeys, built in 1835. It has a rectangular plan, and includes an internal waterway.|$|R
50|$|As a <b>temporary</b> {{measure the}} <b>lock</b> system {{originally}} installed was brought back into use, and Benjamin Bevan, an engineer {{employed by the}} canal company, designed a replacement structure. By this time, cast iron trough aqueducts designed by Thomas Telford for the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and elsewhere, had become proven, and Bevan adopted the system for his structure. However, the canal was then operating as a wide canal in contradistinction to some northern narrowboat canals, so that the troughs had to be substantially larger and stronger than elsewhere.The cast iron units were cast at the Ketley foundry at Coalbrookdale; the company had already been involved with Telford on the Longdon-on-Tern aqueduct. They were transported to Cosgrove by the canal itself, and assembled and erected at site. The new structure was completed in January 1811.|$|R
25|$|Few {{nations have}} {{addressed}} the use of lockouts during whipsaw strikes, however. In the United States, the Supreme Court has ruled on {{the legality of the}} practice. The question before the Court was whether a lockout during a whipsaw strike was an unfair labor practice (ULP) under the National Labor Relations Act and its various amendments. In NLRB v. Truck Drivers Local 449 ("Buffalo Linen Supply Co."), 353 U.S. 87 (1957), the Court held that such a lockout was not a ULP. The high court further extended this ruling in NLRB v. Brown Food Stores, 380 U.S. 278 (1965), holding that an employer could engage in a partial lockout of its employees in advance of a whipsaw strike so long as the employer only utilized <b>temporary</b> replacements and <b>locked</b> out all workers (not just those who supported the union).|$|R

40|$|Abstract The authors {{discuss the}} {{outcomes}} of therapy for CMDs and present a clinical case reporting an alternative method {{for the treatment of}} disc displacement. The orthopaedic therapy for CMDs is based on the use of interocclusal splints. Two kind of splints are prescribed to patients with CMDs: stabilization or repositioning splint. The former is used for a conservative treatment, the latter for irreversible treatment. In view of the poor long-term success of repositioning therapy, the cost of subsequent dental treatment, and the great potential for iatrogenic occlusal and muscular problems, the authors believe that the initial treatment approaches should be, in any case, conservative, reversible, and non invasive. The authors prescribe to their patients the repositioning splint for use either part-time or full time use. Part-time use is effective for preventing disc displacement without reduction. If used full time, once joint noises, pain, and displacement are decreased, the appliance should be adjusted to/or replaced with a stabilization appliance to allow posterior positioning of the mandible into a more physiologically stable position. The authors present a clinical case, a 27 yo female with disc displacement with reduction was treated with stabilization splint. After 6 weeks of therapy she returned reporting a <b>temporary</b> closed <b>lock</b> and sharp pain in the left TMJ. An anterior repositioning splint was fabricated in order to position the mandible forward. After 10 weeks of this treatment the patient reported absence of joint/muscle symptoms and of joint noise...|$|R
2500|$|The Supreme Court {{revisited}} the Mackay Radio ruling repeatedly {{from the}} early 1960s into the late 1980s. Many of the Court's decisions addressed {{the conditions under which}} an employer exhibited anti-union animus. In NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp., 373 U.S. 221 (1963), the Court held that a grant of superseniority to strikebreakers constituted anti-union animus and was a ULP. Building on its ruling in Buffalo Linen Supply Co., the Supreme Court held in American Ship Building v. NLRB, 380 U.S. 300 (1965) that an employer may lock out its employees without violating the NLRA if a bargaining impasse has been reached and the lockout is for the purpose of applying economic pressure to support the employerâ€™s bargaining position. However, the employer cannot hire permanent replacements, only temporary ones. The high court further extended the [...] "Mackay doctrine" [...] in NLRB v. Brown Food Stores, 380 U.S. 278 (1965), holding that an employer could lock out its employees in advance of a whipsaw strike so long as the employer only utilized <b>temporary</b> replacements and <b>locked</b> out all workers (not just those who supported the union). These cases did not address the partial lockout, however. The Court addressed that issue in 1967. In NLRB v. Great Dane Trailers, Inc., 388 U.S. 26 (1967), the Supreme Court held that an employer could avoid being charged with a ULP if it could provide a legitimate and substantial business justification for treating union workers differently than its other employees. However, even if the employer could offer such a justification, the NLRB could still attempt to show anti-union animus at trial.|$|R
