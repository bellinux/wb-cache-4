50|$|Mark Doty's “Tiara” {{was printed}} in 1990 in an {{anthology}} called Poets for Life: Seventy-Six Poets Respond to AIDS. This poem critiques the way society perceived and treated homosexual AIDS sufferers. The 1980s {{marked the beginning}} of the AIDS epidemic in the United States. The United States, with its sophisticated medicine and public health care system, is criticized for not mobilizing quickly enough during the 1980s. The Reagan administration’s delayed action to fight AIDS resulted in thousands of needless deaths, especially among young, gay men. Many believe the initial reluctance to mobilize was due to homophobia—society was uncomfortable with gay sexuality. This poem criticizes the idea that gay men “invited <b>their</b> own <b>oppression</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> consequence of pleasure.” The poem’s phrase “he asked for it” represents this common, unsympathetic opinion about gay men with AIDs. Imagery like “perfect stasis” and “body’s paradise” is used by Doty to paint a future beyond brutality and discrimination for AIDS sufferers. According to Landau, Doty’s poems were “humane and comforting narratives” that offered hope to people living with HIV and stood in contrast to the hostile climate of the United States.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this study examines who feminists are {{and what kinds of}} life experiences {{may have contributed to the}} process of becoming a feminist. A discussion of the barriers to the emergence of a women's movement and a reconsideration of some current explanations of the emergence of a movement at this particular historical moment provide some context for a study of the social development of feminists. Criterion for selecting study subjects was self-identification in terms of commitment and action; in all, 54 women were interviewed, all of whom were students at the time of the interviews and were from predominantly middle class homes. The composite picture of the contemporary feminist which emerges from the research is described in terms of three non-exclusive and sometimes mutually reinforcing models: the bright academic, the father's girl, and the early independent. While the process of becoming a feminist was most often a gradual evolution rather than a sudden conversion, most of the respondents were able to cite specific events and periods during their lives when they became conscious of <b>their</b> <b>oppression</b> <b>as</b> women.

To provide examples, reviews of the portrayal of current ethnic/race relations, schooling and difference itself are examined focusing on how they contribute to forms of inequity by presenting <b>oppression</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> individual rather than structural problem.

25|$|Atwood, who was {{surrounded}} by the intellectual dialogue of the female faculty members at Victoria College, often portrays female characters dominated by patriarchy in her novels. She also sheds light on women's social <b>oppression</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result from patriarchal ideology. Still, Atwood denies that The Edible Woman, published in 1969 and coinciding with the early second wave of the feminist movement, for example, is feminist, and claims that she wrote it four years before the movement.

40|$|Many {{contemporary}} {{forms of}} oppression are not primarily {{the result of}} formally organized collective action nor are they an unintended outcome {{of a combination of}} individual actions. This raises the question of collective responsibility. I argue that we can only determine who is responsible for oppression if we understand <b>oppression</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> matter of social practices that create obstacles for social change. This social practice view of oppression enables two insights: First, that there is an unproblematic sense in which groups can bear irreducible collective responsibility for oppression. Second, that there are derived forms of individual responsibility for members of dominant groups...|$|R

5000|$|Emma Goldman and Lucy Parsons {{represented}} different {{generations of}} anarchism. This resulted in ideological and personal conflict. Carolyn Ashbaugh has explained their disagreements in depth: Lucy Parsons' feminism, which analyzed women's <b>oppression</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> function of capitalism, {{was founded on}} working class values. Emma Goldman’s feminism took on an abstract character of freedom for women in all things, in all times, and in all places; her feminism became separate from its working class origins. Goldman represented the feminism being advocated in the anarchist movement of the 1890s after. The intellectual anarchists questioned Lucy Parsons about her attitudes on the women's question.|$|R
5000|$|Within the women's liberation {{movement}} of the United States during the 1960s, there was a division between the [...] "politicos" [...] and the [...] "radical feminists".

Conversely, the radical feminists did not view women's <b>oppression</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symptom of capitalism and wanted women's liberation to remain independent of the wider leftist movement.|$|R
2500|$|Conflict {{theories}} of state formation regard conflict and dominance of some population over another population as {{key to the}} formation of states. In contrast with voluntary theories, these arguments believe that people do not voluntarily agree to create a state to maximize benefits, but that states form due to some form of oppression by one group over others. A number of different theories rely on conflict, dominance, or <b>oppression</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> causal process or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> necessary mechanism within certain conditions and they may borrow from other approaches. In general the theories highlight: economic stratification, conquest of other peoples, conflict in circumscribed areas, and the neoevolutionary growth of bureaucracy.|$|R

50|$|Black {{separatism}} is a separatist {{political movement}} that seeks separate {{economic and cultural}} development for those of African descent in societies, particularly in the United States. Black separatism is a subcategory of black nationalism, stemming {{from the idea of}} racial solidarity, and implies that blacks should organize themselves {{on the basis of their}} common experience of <b>oppression</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of <b>their</b> blackness, culture, and African heritage. Black separatism in its purest form, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> subcategory of black nationalism, asserts that blacks and whites ideally should form two independent nations. Black separatists also often seek their original cultural homeland. Black separatists generally think that black people are hindered in their advancement in a society dominated by a white majority.|$|R

An {{example of this}} ideological shift was {{the founding of the}} Free University for Chinatown Kids, Unincorporated (FUCKU) initiative in November 1968, which was located in the ICSA youth center in Chinatown. This intentionally provocatively-named initiative was designed to bring together college and Chinatown kids. FUCKU organized speakers and discussions on the history of Chinese Americans. However, FUCKU failed at creating a new political ideology, in part because it focused on oppression in the Chinatown community specifically, instead of <b>oppression</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> larger institutional and social phenomenon. Instead, FUCKU was a meeting place for many Chinatown youth, in particular many youth in the Wah Ching, a group of under-employed Hong Kong immigrant youth.|$|R

Unlike other revolutions which are characterised by bloodshed and violence, it was marked by pacifism. This was possible because the revolutionaries expressed their resentment against the oppressive British measures not through violence, but through the intellectual method of writing sedate pamphlets and delivering calm and thought-provoking speeches. The colonists also viewed the British <b>oppression</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means to purify themselves from the sin of luxury and to dedicate themselves to industry and hard work.
