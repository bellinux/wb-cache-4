40|$|Scoliosis is {{a lateral}} {{curvature}} of the spine {{and it is a}} common cause of back pain especially myofacial pain. Cognitive functional therapy is a novel challenges pain-related behaviors in a cognitively integrated, functionally manner. To study the effect of cognitive functional therapy in treatment of back pain due to postural scoliosis. Thirty Egyptian female patients were assigned randomly in to two equal groups. Patients in the control group received traditional therapeutic exercises (myofacial release, stretching and strengthening exercises of the back muscles), while patients in the experimental group received the same program of control group in addition to cognitive functional therapy. Each group received the program three sessions/week for six weeks. The severity of pain, functional disability, cobb's angle, and lumbar range of motion (flexion, <b>extension,</b> <b>side</b> bending to convex side of scoliosis) were measured before and after 6 weeks of treatment. The statistical analysis revealed that there were there were significant reductions in pain level and functional disability and significant increase in ROM of trunk flexion and trunk <b>extension</b> and <b>side</b> bending between both groups (p < 0. 05) in favor to study group. Conclusion: Supplementation of cognitive functional therapy in therapeutic exercise with myofacial release provided additional benefits with respect to pain, function disability, and lumbar range of motion (flexion, <b>extension,</b> and <b>side</b> bending) in patients with back pain due to postural scoliosis after six weeks of treatment...|$|R

40|$|I. Changes in the Various Elements of the Skin (<b>Extension</b> <b>Side</b> of the Male Forearm) Caused by Aging: Although {{researches}} {{have been}} conducted by Newmann, Unna, Dohi Gans, Ejiri {{and others on the}} subject of the histological changes which are to be caused in the skin in normal persons by aging, the. mechanism of atrophy of the skin occurring in old ages has not been fully clarified yet. Obtaining specimen samples of the skin from the middle part on the <b>extension</b> <b>side</b> of the forearms of forty human males, with the ages ranging from five to eighty, the author performed exhaustive investigations on this subject. The following are the summary of the results: (1) No marked changes due to the differences in age were observed in the stratum corneum, the stratum granulosum, the stratum mucosum and the stratum germinativum of the epiderms; and infiltration of the cells and (Dilatation) of the capillaries in the corium were also free from changes resulting from aging. Vacuolar degeneration of the cells forming the stratum granulosum was sometimes noted but no association of this phenomenon with aging has been observed. (2) Dilatation of hair follicles and increased pigmentation in the stratum germinativum did not take place until the latter part of the fifties. (3) Vacuolar degeneration of the cells in the stratum rnucosum and the stratum germinativum was observed more or less in the similar degree. While the twenties and thirties represented the lowest degree in the occurrence of vacuolar degeneration, there were no great differences in the degrees manifested by other generations. This will indicate that severity in vacuolar degeneration has nothing to do with aging. II. Changes in the Connective Tissue of the Corium (<b>Extension</b> <b>Side</b> of the Male Forearm) Caused by Aging. Using the specimen samples which had been used in the investigations mentioned above, investigations were performed on the changes in the running directions, density diameter, deformed state and branchy state of the elastic fibers of the connective tissue of the corium resulting from aging as well as on what differences due to aging the elastic fibers and collagenic fibers would manifest in their behavior toward coloring, In an effort to investigate into themechanisim of retrograde degeneration of the skin, poisons (0. 1 cc of 0. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of volumetric strain under cyclic stress {{is one of}} the important properties of soil associated with the liquefaction or settlement of sand deposits during earthquakes. The {{purpose of this study is}} to clarify the characteristics of cumulative volumetric strain of relatively loose sand subjected to cyclic stress.
