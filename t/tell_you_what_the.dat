500|$|In October 1954, {{flooding}} {{caused by}} Hurricane Hazel caused {{the destruction of}} bridges and buildings in the valley. As {{a consequence of the}} destruction on the Don and other rivers, the provincial government of Ontario banned development on river floodplains. In 1957, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (MTRCA) was formed, merging all conservation authorities responsible for Toronto watersheds (including the DVCA), with greater powers to manage valley lands. The MTRCA began expropriating privately owned land in the valley for flood control, often creating or conserving open space uses. Sauriol, who was by then an employee of the MTRCA, {{was one of the few}} to speak out against the parkway project. Sauriol's cottage at the Forks of the Don would be expropriated by Metro Toronto for the parkway, although much of his land is now part of the Charles Sauriol Conservation Reserve, which extends from the Forks of the Don, along the East Don to Milne Hollow at Lawrence Avenue, visible from the parkway. By contrast, Metro chairman Gardiner had an opposite opinion of the Don Valley and was quoted [...] "I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Don Valley was. It was a place to murder little boys, that's what it was." ...|$|E

6000|$|With a last effort, Smoke clawed {{his mouth}} free. [...] "I got some dogs out there--dead beat," [...] he said huskily. [...] "Somebody go {{and take care}} of them, and I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think {{myself that}} it would be a pity not to," [...] he said; [...] "we shall be {{alongside}} in ten minutes. But I think it my duty to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> signal is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what.</b> <b>The</b> {{first thing}} to be done is to make another packet like the real one so that if he should ask to see the real one while it's in my possession, you can show him the dummy." ...|$|E

50|$|Price: One of {{the first}} rules of trend {{following}} is that price is the main concern.

The current price and only <b>the</b> price <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> market is doing.|$|R

It is my business to correct this misapprehension by <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> secret service is not. It is not a philanthropic institution. I’ve had you called here on purpose to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> this.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There's {{only one}} way to stop me," [...] Tudor went on. [...] "I can't insult you directly, I know. You are too easy-going, or cowardly, or both, for that.

6000|$|... "No, I presume you did not," [...] {{said his}} father; [...] "but I {{want you to}} {{understand}} it, and remember it after this forever.

50|$|This number <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{company can}} do with what it has, i.e. how many dollars of {{earnings}} they derive from each dollar of assets they control. It's a useful number for comparing competing companies in the same industry. The number will vary widely across different industries. Return on assets gives {{an indication of the}} capital intensity of the company, which will depend on the industry; companies that require large initial investments will generally have lower return on assets. ROAs over 5% are generally considered good.|$|R
