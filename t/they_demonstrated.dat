5|$|In 2010, {{researchers}} at the University of Michigan studied the effect of combining video clips of Sesame Street and related print materials, online activities, and teacher training and mentoring on learning. <b>They</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that all the subjects they tested at Head Start programs in Detroit scored {{the same as a}} middle-class control group in tests later given to both groups.|$|E
5|$|This feat was {{popularly known}} as {{splitting}} the atom. For this accomplishment, Cockcroft and Walton were awarded the Hughes Medal in 1938, and the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1951. They went on to disintegrate carbon, nitrogen and oxygen using protons, deuterons and alpha particles. <b>They</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that they had produced radioactive isotopes, including carbon-11 and nitrogen-13.|$|E
5|$|An {{expert system}} is a program that answers {{questions}} or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge of experts. The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students. Dendral, begun in 1965, identified compounds from spectrometer readings. MYCIN, developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases. <b>They</b> <b>demonstrated</b> the feasibility of the approach.|$|E

5|$|In 1932 Ralph Budd met Edward G. Budd (no relation), an {{automotive}} steel pioneer who was {{founder and}} president of the Budd Company. Edward Budd was demonstrating his new Budd-Michelin rail motorcar built of stainless steel. Pneumatic-wheeled railcars never found popularity for actual service in the US - they tended to derail - but <b>they</b> <b>demonstrated</b> the successful construction of lightweight stainless steel unibody railcars.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{the first}} Cairanoolithus fossils {{discovered}} outside of France were first reported by Albert G. Selles in his PhD thesis at Universitat de Barcelona, {{in which he}} also proposed that Cairanoolithus be moved into its own oofamily. Three years later, Selles and Angel Galobart published a comprehensive reanalysis of Cairanoolithus, in which they formally named the new oofamily, Cairanoolithidae, to contain Cairanaoolithus. Contrary to Cousin's conclusions, Selles and Galobart separated the oospecies C. dughii and C. roussetensis. Also, <b>they</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that Cairanoolithus was not the eggs of an ornithopod or sauropod and conjectured {{that it could be}} the eggs of a nodosaur.|$|E
5|$|The Stuckists gained {{significant}} {{media coverage}} {{for eight years}} of protests (2000–2006 and 2008) outside Tate Britain against the Turner Prize, sometimes dressed as clowns. In 2001 <b>they</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in Trafalgar Square at the unveiling of Rachel Whiteread's Monument. In 2002, they carried a coffin marked The Death of Conceptual Art to the White Cube Gallery. In 2004 outside the launch of The Triumph of Painting at the Saatchi Gallery they wore tall hats with Charles Saatchi's face emblazoned and carried placards claiming that Saatchi had copied their ideas.|$|E

5|$|The {{other two}} stories, those of David and Judith, were often linked in Renaissance art, {{particularly}} by Florentine artists as <b>they</b> <b>demonstrated</b> {{the overthrow of}} tyrants, a popular subject in the Republic. In this image, the shepherd boy, David, has brought down the towering Goliath with his sling, but the giant is alive {{and is trying to}} rise as David forces his head down to chop it off.|$|E
5|$|At Columbia, John R. Dunning {{believed}} {{that this was the}} case, but Fermi was not so sure. The only way to settle this was to obtain a sample of uranium 235 and test it. He got Alfred O. C. Nier from the University of Minnesota to prepare samples of uranium enriched in uranium-234, 235 and 238 using a mass spectrometer. These were ready in February 1940, and Dunning, Eugene T. Booth and Aristid von Grosse then carried out a series of experiments. <b>They</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that uranium-235 was indeed primarily responsible for fission with slow neutrons, but were unable to determine precise neutron capture cross sections because their samples were not sufficiently enriched.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{fireball}} {{was recorded}} by two cameras of the European Fireball Network, {{it was possible}} to calculate the trajectory of its flight through the atmosphere, and afterward also the characteristics of both its pre- and post-encounter orbit in the Solar System. The calculations were published by Czech astronomers Pavel Spurný, Zdeněk Ceplecha, and Jiří Borovička of the Ondřejov Observatory, who specialize in meteor observations. <b>They</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that the swing by the earth significantly altered the meteoroid's orbit. Its aphelion (the farthest it travels from the Sun) and orbital period were lowered to almost half of their original values. The object was initially in a highly inclined orbit (71°) and ended in an orbit with a slightly higher inclination (74°).|$|E

5|$|Like {{his father}} and {{brothers}} before him, Ted attended Harvard College. In his spring semester, {{he was assigned to}} the athlete-oriented Winthrop House, where his brothers had also lived. He was an offensive and defensive end on the freshman football team, with his play being characterized by his large size and fearless style. In his first semester, Kennedy and his classmates arranged to copy answers from another student during the final examination for a science class. At the end of his second semester in May 1951, Kennedy was anxious about maintaining his eligibility for athletics for the next year, and he had a classmate take his place at a Spanish language examination. The ruse was immediately discovered and both students were expelled for cheating. In a standard Harvard treatment for serious disciplinary cases, they were told they could apply for readmission within a year or two if <b>they</b> <b>demonstrated</b> good behavior during that time.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} {{was gradually}} modernised {{in the decades}} following the Second World War, including newer main artillery {{for some of the}} forts and newer secondary artillery for all forts as well as other improvements. But the development of new weapons and the evolution of warfare during the Cold War gradually decreased the importance of the fortifications. Weapons such as cruise missiles and smart bombs made large static fortifications such as Boden Fortress obsolete when <b>they</b> <b>demonstrated</b> their worth during the Gulf War in 1991. Mjösjöberget Fort had been decommissioned and removed from the wartime organisation twelve years earlier in 1979, and less than ten years after the Gulf War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the four other forts followed suit. The last shot was fired from Rödberget on 14:11 local time on 31 December 1997, and exactly one year later, on 31 December 1998, that last fort was decommissioned after 90 years in service.|$|E

25|$|Bryce DeWitt and his {{doctoral}} student R.
