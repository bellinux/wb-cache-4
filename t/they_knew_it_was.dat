The Quraish, however, {{did not succeed}} in killing Muhammad, nor did they occupy the town of Medina, {{possibly}} because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> guarded by Ibn Ubayy. Rodinson suggests that the Meccans did not want to reforge the very unity of the population, which had been jeopardised by Muhammad's defeat.|$|E
25|$|Milwaukee's {{founding}} fathers {{had a vision}} for the city: <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> perfectly situated as a port city, a center for collecting and distributing produce. Many of the new immigrants who were pouring into the new state of Wisconsin {{during the middle of the}} 19th century were wheat farmers. By 1860, Wisconsin was the second ranked wheat-growing state in the country and Milwaukee shipped more wheat than any place in the world. Railroads were needed to transport all this grain from the wheat fields of Wisconsin to Milwaukee's harbor. Improvements in railways at the time made this possible.|$|E

50|$|Because red attracts attention, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{frequently}} used in advertising, though {{studies show that}} people {{are less likely to}} read something printed in red because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> advertising, and because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> more difficult visually to read than black and white text.|$|R
2500|$|While {{studying}} at Georgetown, Ameriie befriended a Washington, D.C. club promoter who eventually {{put her in}} touch with producer Rich Harrison. During an interview with Maxim, Ameriie said she agreed to met up with Harrison at a public location {{because she did not}} know Harrison so she chose a well placed [...] McDonald's parking lot, Harrison played his tracks and Amerie sang along and instantly <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> something special. [...] Harrison, who had just worked on Mary J. Blige's albums Mary and No More Drama, began recording and developing demos with Ameriie. This led to her first record deal with Columbia Records. According to Ameriie, she and Harrison immediately hit it off. In a 2002 interview, she said: [...] "For some reason we had a very special chemistry. When we would work together something great would happen." ...|$|E
2500|$|The hare couldn't see; {{at night}} the hare couldn't see. When the hare arrived there, the cat began to move. When he heard the movement, the hare ran back without taking any water. The pig asked: [...] "Why did you run away without {{bringing}} water?" [...] The hare {{said that there was}} some man there. Again the fox and the hare went to the water. When they came to the spring, they asked the cat: [...] "What are you?" [...] — [...] "I am a man", said the cat. [...] "What is that on your shoulder?", asks the fox. [...] "A rifle", says the cat. The fox and the hare were very frightened, but since <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a cat, afterwards the three of them went together to cook meat. The pig hid behind a bunch of trees and, pushing out its ears, slept, and the cat was warming itself by the fire.|$|E
2500|$|... “Many of the Indians {{would want}} to go out and buy {{trinkets}} and things to carry back home, such as nice blankets and shawls. [...] But during the rainy weather some of them thought they had an excuse to drink. [...] They said they thought it kept them warm. [...] I saw at once that this must not go on, as a little whiskey always calls for more. [...] So I called all the Indians together in council, and explained to them that I had noticed they were beginning to look for liquor again and that it was not good for them. [...] Then I said: “I am going to make a new rule with you. [...] Every man and woman hereafter will receive only half their pay. [...] The balance will be kept in my care until near the end of the season. [...] Then those of you who think you must be spending your money all the time will have something to take home with you when your work is done.’ [...] Some, of course, did not like this plan. [...] While <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for their best interest, still they did not want to do without their liquor. [...] But the majority fell right in with my proposition. [...] They knew I would be honest with them, and that their money was safe with me. [...] So it was agreed that on each pay day half of the money should be put away until the show closed. [...] Further, each man was warned that he must be more careful about drinking.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Many wrestling fans, {{and several}} within the business, believe the Montreal Screwjob was a work, and that Hart was acting in {{collaboration}} with McMahon.

Shawn Michaels recalled people saying that the screwjob [...] "had to be a work", and claimed that McMahon [...] "took a dive" [...] and [...] "sold like he sells on TV" [...] when struck by Hart backstage following the incident. Jerry Lawler, who served as ringside commentator for the match, found it plausible that Hart was working with McMahon, as did Hart's former colleagues Demolition (Ax and Smash), Road Warrior Animal, Steve Blackman, and Sean Waltman. Waltman felt there was a [...] "high possibility" [...] of the screwjob being a work, and believed Hart would not have told anyone, including his wife, about his involvement.|$|E

60|$|The {{difference}} {{between him and}} the other boys at such a time was that <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> make-believe, while to him make-believe and true were exactly the same thing.

60|$|After a time I {{went into}} the parlor, which room was then {{occupied}} by {{the young men and}} young women.
