5|$|On 11 February 2007, O'Gara {{scored the}} first Irish {{international}} <b>try</b> <b>at</b> Croke Park in the 2007 Six Nations Championship loss to France. On 10 March 2007, O'Gara once again scored all of Ireland's points {{to win the}} Triple Crown at Murrayfield, beating Scotland 19–18. On 24 August 2007, in Ireland's final 2007 Rugby World Cup warm-up against Italy at Ravenhill in Belfast, O'Gara scored and converted a controversial try nine minutes into stoppage time, winning the match 23–20 after Italy had taken the lead with their own stoppage-time try. O'Gara finished the match with 18 points.|$|E
5|$|Biggs {{played for}} several club teams {{throughout}} his career, including England's Richmond and Welsh exile club London Welsh. On 24 December 1890, Biggs played for London Welsh in a match against his longterm club Cardiff. The London Welsh team produced a 'devastating display' to beat Cardiff {{by a single}} <b>try.</b> <b>At</b> county level he represented Glamorgan where he played alongside his brother, and later turned out for Somerset. During the 1893/94 season Biggs was made club captain of Cardiff, {{and in the same}} season he led Cardiff against the invitational team the Barbarians, not only winning the game but also scoring two tries and kicking a successful conversion. The same season as he faced the Barbarians with Cardiff, Biggs was invited to join the tourists; one of four of the Biggs brothers to play for the team. The last notable club Biggs represented was Bath, captaining the senior team during the 1899–1900 season.|$|E

5|$|Eventually Shaw {{was driven}} to {{applying}} for office jobs. In the interim he secured a reader's pass for the British Museum Reading Room (the forerunner of the British Library) and spent most weekdays there, reading and writing. His first attempt at drama, begun in 1878, was a blank-verse satirical piece on a religious theme. It was abandoned unfinished, as was his first <b>try</b> <b>at</b> a novel. His first completed novel, Immaturity (1879), was too grim to appeal to publishers and did not appear until the 1930s. He was employed briefly by the newly formed Edison Telephone Company in 1879–80, and as in Dublin achieved rapid promotion. Nonetheless, when the Edison firm merged with the rival Bell Telephone Company, Shaw chose not to seek {{a place in the}} new organisation. Thereafter he pursued a full-time career as an author.|$|E
5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music. You have to <b>try,</b> <b>at</b> least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
5|$|Prototype {{released}} a PlayStation 2 (PS2) port of Ecstasy titled Little Busters! Converted Edition on December 24, 2009, which removed the adult {{elements of the}} game. The PS2 version was available to <b>try</b> <b>at</b> Key 10th Memorial Fes, an event held in commemoration of Key's ten-year anniversary between February 28 and March 1, 2009. A PlayStation Portable (PSP) version of Little Busters! Converted Edition, also by Prototype, was released on November 25, 2010. The Windows and PS2 versions had voice acting for only the major characters, but the PSP version contained full voice acting {{for all of the}} characters other than Riki. Prototype also {{released a}} version of Little Busters! Converted Edition ported to the PlayStation Vita (PS Vita) on March 22, 2012. Along with also having full voice acting, the PS Vita version contains 1.4x larger CGs than the Windows edition, and the limited edition came bundled with a drama CD. Prototype released a PlayStation 3 (PS3) version of Converted Edition with the additional content included in the previous consumer ports on March 20, 2013.

25|$|In the interim, Vang Pao was scheming {{a renewal}} of the {{offensive}} in a week, on 3 January. However, this new assault was never launched. Instead, the 148 Regiment survived air strikes to arrive on 5 January as communist reinforcements. Bullpup missiles fired from U.S. fighter-bombers were used in a vain <b>try</b> <b>at</b> breaking the communists. They failed, {{at the cost of}} a friendly fire incident. On 7 January 1969, Vang Pao ended Operation Pigfat. The retreat began.|$|E
25|$|He did {{not achieve}} {{much in the}} Test matches but it was off his bowling that Don Bradman {{completed}} his 100th first class century. When Bradman reached 99, in the match for an Australian XI against the Indians, the Indian captain Lala Amarnath brought Kishenchand on to bowl. It was his first <b>try</b> <b>at</b> bowling during the tour. After playing a few balls carefully, Bradman took a single past mid-on to reach his hundred. He scored a duck {{in each of the}} five Tests that he played.|$|E
25|$|In early February 1973, two battalions of the PAVN 9th Regiment {{and some}} {{supporting}} Dac Cong sappers moved south approaching Paksong. On 7 February, they occupied the Phou Nongkin high ground seven kilometers northeast of Paksong. Reports of Communist tanks appearing to stiffen the PAVN advance caused the Thai mercenaries {{to evacuate the}} town. The next day, a Royalist <b>try</b> <b>at</b> retaking the ruins was foiled. On 10 February, the MR 4 Special Battalion supplanted GM 33 at Tha Theng. GM 33 moved south, and overcame light opposition to reoccupy {{the remains of a}} flattened Paksong on 12 February.|$|E

25|$|The most points {{scored by}} a team in one match was England when they scored 80 points against Italy in 2001. England also scored the most ever points in a season in 2001 with 229, and most tries in a season with 29. Wales hold the record for fewest tries conceded during a season in the Six Nations era, conceding only 2 in 5 games in 2008, but the 1977 Grand Slam-winning France team did not concede a try in their four matches.

25|$|On {{his second}} <b>try</b> <b>at</b> the 1928 federal election, Chifley won the Division of Macquarie in the House of Representatives, which covered Bathurst, Lithgow, and the Blue Mountains. He was in general a {{supporter}} of the James Scullin government's economic policies, and in 1931 he became Minister for Defence. At the 1931 federal election, the Scullin government was defeated in a landslide and Chifley lost his seat on a 16-point swing to the UAP's John Lawson. During the Great Depression in Australia he survived on his wife's family's money and his part-ownership of the Bathurst newspaper the National Advocate.|$|E
25|$|The second test, on 7 July, saw the Lions lose 35–14 at the Docklands Stadium. Wilkinson {{was blamed}} by many for {{throwing}} a long pass inside his 22 that was intercepted by Joe Roff: this {{was seen as}} the turning point in the match, and probably the test series. During the match, Wilkinson injured his leg and was stretchered off the pitch. The injury was thought to be particularly serious, but he made a full recovery before the Third and final test on 14 July. Wilkinson's <b>try</b> <b>at</b> the start of the second half ensured that, along with his kicking scores, he equalled the Lions' best individual scoring total in a Test, with 18points.|$|E

25|$|Their absence {{suggested}} that a Kenyan runner might top the men's podium {{for the first time}} in over ten years. The largely untested Paul Tanui had established himself by summarily beating his more experienced counterparts by over half a minute at the Kenyan championships. Leonard Komon and Joseph Ebuya were other Kenyan men in strong form. Many of Ethiopia's top athletes were absent, although the defending champion Gebregziabher Gebremariam was a key medal contender and former junior champion Ayele Abshero was making his first <b>try</b> <b>at</b> the senior ranks. Outside the traditionally successful Ethiopian and Kenya teams, Samuel Tsegay of Eritrea and 2009 silver medallist Moses Ndiema Kipsiro of Uganda were medal possibilities, while the 2009 European Champion Alemayehu Bezabeh headed an improved Spanish team.|$|E
25|$|Presented {{with the}} choice of making another <b>try</b> <b>at</b> {{capturing}} Paksong quickly before the rainy season closed down military activities, or waiting until next dry season, the planners of Sayasila decided {{to ask for help}} with the former. They garnered a commitment of 40 or more daily sorties of tactical air support from the U.S. Air Force for Sayasila through 25 September. Instrument flight rules target boxes containing no friendly forces were delineated so radar-directed bombing in them could occur despite unfavorable weather. They also managed to persuade neighboring MR 3 to loan them another guerrilla regiment, Groupement Mobile 32 (GM 32) to continue the assault. Once again, the two objectives were taking Paksong and opening Route 23 towards the Vietnamese border.|$|E
25|$|A {{daughter}} of Charles and Anaïs Lenglen, Suzanne Lenglen {{was born in}} Paris.

Her first <b>try</b> <b>at</b> the game was in 1910, when she played on the tennis court at the family property in Marest-sur-Matz.
