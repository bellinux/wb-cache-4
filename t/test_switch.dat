50|$|System tests {{could be}} {{conducted}} {{in one of two}} ways: In a coded pull station, there is either a test hole on the front (usually activated with an Allen wrench) or a <b>test</b> <b>switch</b> on the inside. Turning the switch one way causes the notification appliances to sound continuously (or in the case of single-stroke bells, ding once). Turning it the other way and then activating the pull allows a silent test to be done in which the station's mechanical parts are checked to ensure proper function. Once pulled, the station would do at least four rounds of code before resetting itself. Coded pulls were typically used in new fire alarm systems until roughly the 1950s, and then occasionally into the 1970s. Until the early 1990s, some panels were made with an extra zone to accommodate any existing coded pull stations. Nowadays, coded pull stations are very rare and almost never seen in working fire alarm systems.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} 4Matic system was originally a complex electronically controlled system with automatically engaging four-wheel drive (4WD), the system employs locking central and rear differentials {{to provide additional}} traction in slippery conditions. The centre differential, {{also known as the}} transfer case, contains two clutches. Each hydraulically enabled clutch is controlled separately to allow for three modes of operation: 2WD (mode 0) where 100% of available torque is available to the rear axle while the front axle is disconnected, and two 4WD modes which allow for 35/65 front/rear axle torque split (mode 1) or 50/50 front/rear axle torque split (mode 2). The rear differential lock, previously known as ASD on Mercedes-Benz models, can also be locked (mode 3) if rear wheel slip is still present when the transfer case 50/50 4WD mode 2 is engaged. Due to safety and stability concerns there is no front differential lock. The 4Matic system uses inputs from the three channel ABS system and a steering wheel angle sensor to decide when to intervene. 4WD is disengaged automatically if the ABS service brakes are applied. Engine throttle control is not inherent in the W124 system. Two W124 variants of the 4Matic system were produced: the first system (1986-1991) used a mechanical pressure test lever to disable the system hydraulically while the second system variant (1992/1993) used an electrical <b>test</b> <b>switch</b> to break power to the system. The later system variant when in test mode allows for continued operation of the rear shock self-levelling system (SLS) when installed. Initially plagued with reliability factors, the multi-plate clutch central differentials were subject to failure; it was discontinued in 1993.|$|E
40|$|Near an {{electric}} arc some polymers {{can change the}} properties of an arcing medium in a beneficial manner. Such polymers, known as ablation material, decompose and evaporate when exposed to heat from {{an electric}} arc. The evaporated polymer improves current interruption capability by increased pressure and heat dissipation. The target is to use arc quenching properties of ablation material {{to reduce the size}} of load break switches (LBSs) that interrupts current in atmospheric air. Consequently, the air insulated LBSs can be more competitive to more compact SF 6 insulated breakers. The present thesis is an experimental study of polypropylene (PP) as ablation material. Experiments are performed in a medium-voltage (MV) laboratory to determine the interruption limits with regards to current level and shape of transient recovery voltage (TRV). Little has earlier been published in this field of study so the design of the <b>test</b> <b>switch</b> is developed through experimental work. The <b>test</b> <b>switch</b> interrupts the thermal part of the current interruption for all tested currents, up to 800 A. Even for hard TRVs the switch interrupted the thermal part to an impressive degree. The dielectric strength in the arcing zone after the thermal phase is however a larger challenge. For a current of 800 A, the <b>test</b> <b>switch</b> struggles to withstand a recovery voltage higher than 6 kV the first 300 &# 181;s after current zero (CZ) crossing. The ablation effect is more or less self-regulated since the arc intensity is directly related to current magnitude. Experiments indicate that the <b>test</b> <b>switch</b> struggles with low currents since the heat becomes too low. However, the thermal part is still interrupted for a current of 80 A, but recovery voltages above 2 kV the first 200 &# 181;s after CZ crossing &# 181;s is likely to cause a re-ignition. </p...|$|E

40|$|Load break {{switches}} (LBSs) {{are common}} inside {{metal clad switchgear}} assemblies where space is a limiting factor. SF 6 is usually used in this application due to its superior electrical characteristics, but is unfortunately also a strong greenhouse gas. Therefore development of new products, utilizing air which is an environmental friendly alternative, is in progress. Since air has much lower dielectric strength than SF 6, the main challenge with this is therefore to reduce the size. Compact SF 6 products have created a retrofit market, and in many existing installation sites larger products will not fit. Current interruption is a complex process and depends on several parameters, {{and it is not}} straight forward to optimize the design of a medium voltage (MV) switch. Numerical simulation which is a common for product development in other areas is difficult for this application. Due to the long dominance of SF 6 products, little research has been published about the design criteria for LBS technology in air. The scope of the thesis covers current interruption of MV LBSs in air with respect to various design parameters, such as nozzle geometry, nozzle materials, gas flow, and contact movement. Both gas blow-assisted current interruption (associated with puffer breakers) and ablation-assisted current interruption are addressed. The material in the nozzle can enhance the interruption capability. Such a nozzle material is called ablation material. When the arc is burning close to the surface of an ablation material, gas is evaporated which cools the arc. This technology is used to some extent for low voltage switchgear, but much less for higher voltages. The objective is therefore to investigate the potential of this technology for the MV LBS application. All work is done experimentally with similar test conditions as are used for product type testing. A direct powered MV laboratory and a <b>test</b> <b>switch</b> are built. The <b>test</b> <b>switch</b> is designed particularly for parameter studies. The result from air blow experiments reveal the minimum upstream pressure drop required for current interruption for various basic nozzle geometries, and at different contact positions. One study is particular relevant for the 24 kV / 630 A class, and it is found that 0. 25 - 0. 3 bar upstream pressure drop appears to be a threshold value for successful interruption. It is also presented how the minimum upstream pressure drop varies for different MV LBS ratings. The results show that the needed pressure drop is approximately proportional, both towards the current and towards the rate of rise of recovery voltage. This investigation is made so that the majority of all MV LBS ratings (7 - 52 kV and up to 900 A) are covered. From the ablation experiments it was found that high content of hydrogen in the ablation material is favorable for enhancing the current interruption capability. In a comparison experiment between different polymers, polypropylene shows best interruption capability. This material was therefor applied as ablation material in the <b>test</b> <b>switch,</b> and tested in the MV laboratory. The results reveal high capability to interrupt the thermal phase (over the needs for most MV LBSs), but also that the transient recovery voltage several milliseconds after current zero often leads to dielectric re-ignition. This is opposite to a puffer breaker where the thermal interruption instead appears to be the crucial part. PhD i elkraftteknikkPhD in Electric Power Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Current {{interruption}} {{is vital}} {{in the power}} system, as this {{makes it possible to}} control the use of different loads, change the grid configuration, and minimize damage when faults occur. This thesis presents a study of the different switch design and test circuit parameters involved in medium voltage air load break switching and how they affect the thermal interrupting capability. Mediumvoltage load break switches are common in the distribution grid, and are a cheaper option than installing circuit breakers. Medium voltage load current ratings are typically in the range of 6 – 36 kV and 400 A up to around 1 kA (50 Hz). Air is considered an environmentally benign alternative as an interrupting medium compared to SF 6 for these ratings, and is also thought to be cost-competitive compared to vacuum. However, no compact air load break switch for 24 kV is currently available for commercial use. Thus, it is necessary to have a good understanding of the design parameters involved, and how they affect the interrupting capability of the switch. This thesis addresses medium-voltage load current interruption in air. It is an empirical study based on an extensive test program in a medium voltage test lab, and the main results and contents of this thesis are presented in five papers. The two first are switch design parameter studies. Using a <b>test</b> <b>switch</b> that is simple and axisymmetric, yet in many aspects similar to commercial puffer devices, one <b>test</b> <b>switch</b> parameter has been changed at a time to find the air flow over-pressure needed for successful interruption. The test circuit settings are also varied to find how the interrupting capability changes with load currents in the range 400 – 880 A, and with a transient recovery voltage corresponding to IEC’s 24 kV ”mainly active load” test duty. Only the thermal phase of current interruption has been considered, i. e. the first tens of microseconds after current zero. The over-pressures needed to interrupt the load currents were typically from 0. 2 to 0. 4 bar. The third paper presents a logistic regression analysis of all the conducted interruption tests, with the goal of describing the interruption performance {{as a function of the}} main <b>test</b> <b>switch</b> design parameters and transient recovery voltage stresses. More than 3 000 interruption tests are used as input data for this analysis, which produce a mathematical expression that summarizes all the empirical results. The nozzle-to-contact diameter ratio has been found to be an important design factor. Low ratios require a substantially lower air over-pressure than high nozzle-to-contact diameter ratios in order to interrupt successfully. The choice of contact diameter important as well, where larger contact diameters require lower over-pressures, but higher mass flow rates. The nozzle length does not influence the interrupting capability very much, but the chance of successful interruption is greater when the pin contact has moved out of the nozzle at current zero. The interruption becomes more difficult with increasing current and the rate of the voltage build-up across the contacts after interruption. The other two papers are based on the current interruption experiments mentioned above, but concern details of the arc behavior and arc voltage under different currents, test design variations and air flow conditions. For typical medium-voltage and load current ratings, the arc greatly affects the air flow during current interruption. The flow through the tulip contact and nozzle is clogged during the high current part of the half-cycle, even for moderate currents and relatively large contact dimensions. The typical over-pressures needed for successful interruption correspond to air velocities that are well below supersonic level. The arc voltage is a function of several parameters, and rises with increasing air over-pressure, decreasing current, and a larger contact gap. There is also a clear visible difference in the arc appearance when it is either subjected to forced cooling or not. The typical arc voltage is a few hundred volts...|$|E

The University of Missouri has studied parameters affecting the runtime and jitter of a laser triggered gas switch. Experiments tested a variety of switch parameters including percentage of self-break and charge voltage. The effects of laser beam parameters were also considered, including focal length, laser energy and laser spark length. Experiments were performed on the Tiger pulsed power machine. Measurements were taken on a spark gap switch built from the trigger section of a Rimfire switch.

40|$|Compact {{load break}} {{switches}} (LBSs) are common inside compact substations, {{and other places}} in the medium voltage distribution system where space is a limiting factor. SF 6 is usually applied as interruption and insulation gas due to its excellent electrical characteristics. However, because of its strong greenhouse gas potential, other more environmentally benign gases, like air, are of interest to the industry. Current interruption is a complex process, and optimising the design of a medium voltage LBS is difficult. When using air instead of SF 6, optimisation with regard to size is important, since larger equipment will not fit in many existing installation sites. Due to the superior properties of SF 6, little research has been done on using air as interrupting gas in LBSs, and good simulation tools for design optimisation are yet to be developed. This master thesis concerns current interruption in air at load currents with different nozzle and contact geometries, and investigates how the air flow is affected by these parameters. Furthermore, the possibility to use the arcing voltage as a parameter {{in the development of a}} simulation tool for predicting the outcome of an interruption is also examined. A high-speed camera has been used to film the interruption to more thoroughly understand the impact the air flow has on the arc. This report consists mainly of experimental work conducted with a <b>test</b> <b>switch</b> and laboratory designed for parameter studies, and with test conditions similar to those used for product testing. The results from current interruption testing show that the minimum upstream over-pressure needed to successfully interrupt the current varies for different currents and nozzle geometries. For the 24 kV / 630 A tests, a threshold value for obtaining successful interruptions seems to be 0. 3 bar over-pressure, while at 880 A an over-pressure of at least 0. 4 bar is required for the tested geometries. The arcing voltage was monitored during successful and unsuccessful current interruptions, but no clear difference in the arcing voltage was found between the two outcomes. During interruption testing, steep drops in the arcing voltage have occasionally been observed. By filming the arc it was found that these steep drops most likely were caused by the arc short circuiting itself due to unnecessary elongation. </p...|$|E

In ZR, the pulse rise time through the LTS is > 200 ns and additional stages of pulse compression are required to achieve the desired < 100 ns rise time. The inductance of the LTS ({approx} 500 nH) in large part determines the energy transfer time through the switch and {{there is much to}} be gained in improving system performance and reducing system costs by reducing this inductance. The current path through the cascade section of the ZR LTS is at a diameter of {approx} 6 -inches which is certainly not optimal from an inductance point of view. The LTS connects components of much greater diameter (typically 4 - 5 feet). In this LDRD the viability of switch concepts in which the diameter of cascade section is greatly increased have been investigated. The key technical question to be answered was, will the desired multi-channel behavior be maintained in a cascade section of larger diameter. This LDRD proceeded in 2 distinct phases. The original plan for the LDRD was to develop a promising switch concept and then design, build, and test a moderate scale switch which would demonstrate the key features of the concept. In phase I, a switch concept which meet all electrical design criteria and had a calculated inductance of 150 nH was developed. A 1. 5 MV <b>test</b> <b>switch</b> was designed and fabrication was initiated. The LDRD was then redirected due to budgetary concerns. The fabrication of the switch was halted and the focus of the LDRD was shifted to small scale experiments designed to answer the key technical question concerning multi-channel behavior.

The purpose of MCST was to provide a versatile, fast turn around facility for the study the multi-channel electrical breakdown behavior of a ZR type cascade switch gap in a parameter space near that of a ZR LTS.
