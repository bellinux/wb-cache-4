Nevertheless, Pigot has argued that {{her place in the}} Australian art world at the time was complex, and her style was affected by vigorous debate around the emergence of modernism, which was being resisted by local critics. Her experience of this more conservative Australia, and the effects of the deaths of all those close to her, contributed to Rix Nicholas abandoning her more experimental art, and returning to more academic and figurative subjects. This ultimately had a detrimental effect on the long-term trajectory of her career. Pigot also argues that her refusal to conform to <b>the</b> <b>gendered</b> expectations of the Australian artistic establishment led to her rejection.|$|E

25|$|Gender {{inequality}} both {{leads to}} {{and is a}} result of food insecurity. According to estimates women and girls make up 60% of the world's chronically hungry and little {{progress has been made in}} ensuring the equal right to food for women enshrined in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Women face discrimination both in education and employment opportunities and within the household, where their bargaining power is lower. On the other hand, gender equality is described as instrumental to ending malnutrition and hunger. Women tend to be responsible for food preparation and childcare within the family and are more likely to spend their income on food and their children's needs. Women also play an important role in food production, processing, distribution and marketing. They often work as unpaid family workers, are involved in subsistence farming and represent about 43% of the agricultural labor force in developing countries, varying from 20% in Latin America to 50% in Eastern and Southeastern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. However, women face discrimination in access to land, credit, technologies, finance and other services. Empirical studies suggest that if women had the same access to productive resources as men, women could boost their yields by 20–30%; raising the overall agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5 to 4%. While those are rough estimates, the significant benefit of closing the gender gap on agricultural productivity cannot be denied. <b>The</b> <b>gendered</b> aspects of food security are visible along the four pillars of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability, as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization.|$|E

500|$|This {{migration}} of {{women into the}} workforce shook the traditional ideology of gender roles, but importantly, it was the catalyst to the double burden becoming noticeable. The 1930s [...] "encouraged women to fulfill what Stalin termed the [...] "great and honorable duty that nature has given" [...] them. Evident in the Soviet Union, [...] "an officially sponsored cult of motherhood, buttressed by anti-abortion legislation" [...] accompanied by a [...] "depression of living standards" [...] led to industry's immense demand for laborers which got women into the industrial workforce in unprecedented numbers". Urban women thus found themselves assuming the [...] "double burden" [...] (also known as the [...] "double shift") of waged {{work outside the home}} and the lion's share of unpaid labor within it." [...] The Second World War is typically seen as a catalyst for increasing female employment. Best exemplified by [...] Rosie the Riveter propaganda of an efficient, patriotic, woman worker, World War II increased demand for female labor to replace that of the [...] "16million men mobilized to serve in the Armed Forces". While a substantial number of women worked in war factories, the majority of jobs were in the service sector.

For example, Ramón Saldívar observes that The House on Mango Street [...] "represents from the simplicity of childhood vision the enormously complex process of the construction of <b>the</b> <b>gendered</b> subject". In the same vein, Felicia J.

One newspaper reported that Rix Nicholas's entry had been one of the top three. Rix Nicholas was furious, as were some former soldiers who wrote letters to newspapers about the incident. Pigot suggests that gender was a factor: [...] "While Rix Nicholas's claim to be a war artist was legitimate, the fact that she was a woman meant that she was denied an equal place within the discourse". Later that same year, the Australian War Memorial decided to purchase a work by Rix Nicholas portraying a French woman (titled A Mother of France (1914)), but not to acquire the other work offered, showing an Australian soldier (A Man (1921)); according to Pigot, this reflected <b>the</b> <b>gendered</b> approach taken by institutions, which considered that subjects suitable for portrayal by artists were dependent upon their sex.|$|E
