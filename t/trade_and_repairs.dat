40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{potential}} of the manufacturing and services sectors as drivers of economic growth in Namibia. The paper uses the intersectoral linkage analysis method to identify the industries with the greatest backward and forward linkages. The economy-wide impact of these industries is simulated further using a CGE model. The greatest backward linkages for manufacturing industries were found in meat processing, fish processing, grain milling, basic metals and construction. The greatest backward linkages for the tertiary industries were found in <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>repairs,</b> hotels and restaurants, finance and insurance, and other private services. The greatest forward linkages for manufacturing industries were found in paper and printing, chemicals and rubber, fabricated metals and machinery, and electricity generation and distribution. The greatest forward linkages for tertiary industries were found in transport, communication, finance and insurance, and market real estate and business services. These, therefore, are the sectors that policies could target as they have greatest impact and could enable Namibia to achieve higher levels of growth. Further, simulation results are obtained from a CGE model by introducing direct exogenous increases in the output of the perceived key industries and examining the economy-wide feedback effects...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we tried to}} analyze recent {{development}} of FDI in Poland with special respect paid to growing service offshoring. We found out that theoretical perspective given by the Investment Development Path (IDP) hypothesis {{can be useful in}} interpreting trends in FDI flows and structure. When analyzing IDP – described by the NOIP (Net Outward Investment Position) – we found out that changes of NOIP can be analyzed together with a new indicator, i. e. : ROIP (Relative Outward Investment Position) which according to our analyses can serve as a leading indicator of NOIP, especially when maturity of the second IDP stage economies to enter the third stage of IDP is concerned. The result of our analyses of NOIP and ROIP development for the Polish economy is that Poland is still a few years before entering the third stage of IDP. At the sector level analysis we proved that {{due to the fact that}} FDI inflows to manufacturing sector started earlier than to services, manufacturing sectors ’ capacities to expand to foreign markets are better that these of many services sectors. The same reason explained the difference between various type of services. Financial services as well as <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>repairs</b> experienced huge inflows of FDI many years before business services. This resulted in faste...|$|E
40|$|Guided by {{a simple}} theory of task {{assignment}} and time allocation, we investigate the long run response to national differences in tax rates on labor income, payrolls and consumption. The theory implies that higher tax rates reduce work time in the market sector, {{increase the size of}} the shadow economy, alter the industry mix of market activity, and twist labor demand in a way that amplifies negative effects on market work and concentrates effects on the less skilled. We also describe conditions whereby cross-country OLS regressions yield consistent estimates of the total effect of taxes, inclusive of indirect effects that work through government spending responses to tax revenues. Regressions on rich-country samples in the mid 1990 s indicate that a unit standard deviation tax rate difference of 12. 8 percentage points leads to 122 fewer market work hours per adult per year, a drop of 4. 9 percentage points in the employment-population ratio, and a rise in the shadow economy equal to 3. 8 percent of GDP. It also leads to 10 to 30 percent lower employment and value added shares in (a) retail <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>repairs,</b> (b) eating, drinking and lodging, and (c) a broader industry group that includes wholesale and motor trade.

40|$|A tight {{labour market}} can {{increase}} employee turnover. Under these conditions, retention strategies become more important. A first simple and low-cost {{method is to}} change the selection strategy by focusing on hiring individuals who are more prone to remain than others. Biographical data of applicants can indicate this. The study tests different theoretical concepts and hypotheses related to retention, such as past behaviour, which can predict future behaviour and habitual commitment, motivation to work for the current employer or job embeddedness. Collating and keying data from the rich source of 105 applications for front line service workers of a car rental company in Germany, a new dataset with variables like employment source, employment status, re-application, duration of last position, and number of job changes, occupational experience, length of work experience, and work experience in certain types of industry, is generated. Regression analyses reveal that new hires from retail, <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair</b> industry are significantly less likely to leave voluntarily than new hires from other industries. This result may have less to do with the fit of a new hire to the job than resulting from external labour market conditions, as employees are paid better in car rental organisations than in most retail, <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair</b> organisations. Results also hint to a higher retention rate for new hires referred by current employees which would suggest that job embeddedness through personal links at work can increase retention. Biodata {{can be used as a}} selection tool for organisations when hiring front line service workers to prevent turnover. However, particularly given the few significant results, it should not be the only measure...|$|R

30|$|This {{reasoning}} {{suggests that}} many of the middle skill jobs that persist in the future will combine routine technical tasks with the set of non-routine tasks in which workers hold comparative advantage—interpersonal interaction, flexibility, adaptability and problem-solving. 32 Medical para-professions are one leading example of this virtuous combination, but this example is not a singularity. This broad description also fits numerous skilled <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair</b> occupations—plumbers, builders, electricians, HVAC installers, automotive technicians—marketing occupations, and even modern clerical occupations that provide coordination and decision-making functions rather than simply typing and filing. Indeed, even as some formerly middle skill occupations are stripped of their routine technical tasks and arguably deskilled—for example the stockbroking occupation—other formerly high-end technical occupations are made accessible to workers with less esoteric technical mastery, for example, the nurse practitioner occupation that increasingly performs diagnosing and prescribing tasks in lieu of physicians. I expect that a significant stratum of middle skill, non-college jobs combining specific vocational skills with foundational middle skills—literacy, numeracy, adaptability, problem-solving and common sense—will persist in coming decades.|$|R
