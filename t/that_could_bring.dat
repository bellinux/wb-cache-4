5|$|Solar and lunar eclipses were {{considered}} to be especially dangerous events <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> catastrophe upon the world. In the Dresden Codex, a solar eclipse is represented by a serpent devouring the k'in ("day") hieroglyph. Eclipses were interpreted as the sun or moon being bitten, and lunar tables were recorded in order that the Maya might be able to predict them, and perform the appropriate ceremonies to ward off disaster.|$|E
5|$|The rank of {{each person}} was {{determined}} by how many divine generals they had at their disposal, and {{by the number of}} divine scriptures they had obtained. These divine generals were used to fight wandering demons <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> misfortune or illness on someone. A person received their first general at the age of six years, and in subsequent ceremonies would be given more and generals and achieve a higher ranking until a full complement was achieved at the age of nineteen. Marriage would unite two sets of generals, thus giving a couple use of 150 divine generals. After marriage, further increases in ranking could only be achieved by religious achievement.|$|E

5|$|After {{being drafted}} by the Blue Jackets, Filatov signed a three-year {{contract}} with the club on July 10, 2008. His base salary for the contract was $875,000, with bonus clauses <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> the value as high as $1.35million per season. His signing with Columbus created some controversy within the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), however, as League President Alexander Medvedev claimed that the Blue Jackets owed CSKA Moscow compensation of at least $1.5million for signing Filatov. Medvedev claimed that although the term of the contract had expired, under Russian law it did not terminate until an indemnity amount had been negotiated. The Blue Jackets and Filatov believed that giving his club 30 days notice was sufficient to terminate the contract. CSKA threatened to withhold Filatov's transfer card, thus impeding his ability to play in another league, but Filatov, his lawyers and the Blue Jackets believed they had followed the necessary tenets of Russian law. Filatov's contract was one of six reviewed by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) {{in an attempt to}} mediate the disputes between the KHL and NHL. During this investigation, the players were unable to play international hockey sanctioned by the IIHF. In September, the KHL dropped its opposition to Filatov's contract with the Blue Jackets, and he received his transfer.|$|E

Keolis took over the operations on July 1, 2014. Keolis lost $29.3 million in its first year of operation.|$|E

25|$|There {{was much}} debate about {{possible}} routes that a canal could take. Coal merchants in Liverpool felt threatened about a canal <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> coal in from Cheshire. The {{owners of the}} River Weaver Navigation were also not happy about the proposals, because the route would almost parallel that of the river. Yet another route was published which, much to the shock of Wedgwood, did not at all include the potteries.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the bid, those {{involved}} in British sport were hopeful that there would also be a 2012 legacy of increased commitment to sport in the UK, with the social and health benefits they believe <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring,</b> but {{it will be difficult to}} assess whether or not this really happens. Some commentators have argued that it would be better to invest directly in grass roots sport.|$|E
25|$|As {{a kind of}} {{response}} to Clement Greenberg's Avant-Garde and Kitsch in 1990 Kirk Varnedoe and Adam Gopnik curated High and Low: Modern Art and Popular Culture, at New York's Museum of Modern Art. The exhibition attempted to elucidate the extent that artists and high culture drew on and from popular culture. Although universally panned {{at the time as}} the only event <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> Douglas Crimp and Hilton Kramer together in a chorus of scorn. The exhibition is remembered today as a benchmark of the conflict between late modernism and postmodernism.|$|E

25|$|Snakes {{were both}} revered and worshipped and feared by early civilizations. The ancient Egyptians {{recorded}} prescribed treatments for snakebites {{as early as}} the Thirteenth Dynasty in the Brooklyn Papyrus, which includes at least seven venomous species common to the region today, such as the horned vipers. In Judaism, the Nehushtan was a pole with a snake made of copper fixed upon it. The object was regarded as a divinely empowered instrument of God <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> healing to Jews bitten by venomous snakes while they were wandering in the desert after their exodus from Egypt. Healing came about by merely looking at the object as it was held up by Moses.|$|E
25|$|This {{meant that}} taxes, {{infrastructure}} improvement, and internal trade policy were defined independently by each territory, leading to many internal customs barriers and tolls, and conflicting policies {{even within the}} Habsburg domains. Charles I and Philip II {{had been able to}} master the various courts through their impressive political energy, but the much weaker Philip III and IV allowed it to decay, and Charles II was incapable of controlling anything at all. The development of Spain itself was hampered by the fact that Charles I and Philip II spent most of their time abroad; for most of the 16th century, Spain was administrated from Brussels and Antwerp, and it was only during the Dutch Revolt that Philip returned to Spain, where {{he spent most of his}} time in the seclusion of the monastic palace of El Escorial. The empire, held together by a determined king keeping the bureaucracy together, experienced a setback when a less-trusting ruler came to the throne. Philip II distrusted the nobility and discouraged any independent initiative among them. While writers of the time offered novel solutions to Spain's problems such as using irrigation in agriculture and encouragement of economic activity, the nobility never really produced anyone <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> about serious reforms.|$|E
25|$|One {{characteristic}} of postmodern art is its conflation {{of high and}} low culture through the use of industrial materials and pop culture imagery. The use of low forms of art were a part of modernist experimentation as well, as documented in Kirk Varnedoe and Adam Gopnik's 1990–91 show High and Low: Popular Culture and Modern Art at New York's Museum of Modern Art, an exhibition that was universally panned at the time as the only event <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> Douglas Crimp and Hilton Kramer together in a chorus of scorn. Postmodern art is noted for {{the way in which it}} blurs the distinctions between what is perceived as fine or high art and what is generally seen as low or kitsch art. Whilst this concept of 'blurring' or 'fusing' high art with low art had been experimented during modernism, it only ever became fully endorsed after the advent of the postmodern era. Postmodernism introduced elements of commercialism, kitsch and a general camp aesthetic within its artistic context; postmodernism takes styles from past periods, such as Gothicism, the Renaissance and the Baroque, and mixes them so as to ignore their original use in their corresponding artistic movement. Such elements are common characteristics of what defines postmodern art.|$|E

[...] Lieberstein said the script drew less attention to long-standing story arcs, which new viewers would not understand. Lieberstein said, [...] "It almost had an air of a pilot in a way, where we had to reintroduce everything. We wanted it to be extremely funny and extremely funny up front." [...] The Office creator Greg Daniels said he felt the episode had to focus on physical comedy and easily accessible set pieces. Daniels said, [...] "I looked at all the shows that followed the Super Bowl in years past and I feel that a comedy would be a good choice in the current climate. People want to laugh so we're trying our best to supply some laughs." [...] Actor Rainn Wilson said of the episode, [...] "It's a great opportunity for people to revisit the world of The Office and hopefully get into our style of comedy." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{inclusion}} of the Bautista bat flip celebration, which could be viewed during the beta, received wide media coverage, with sites such as Yahoo!

Brian Mazique of Forbes lauded the game's graphics, stating that [...] "NHL continues to be one of the most attractive sports games available." [...] He also praised the game's improved AI systems for CPU teammates and opponents as well as the online connectivity. He was more critical of the HUT mode's menus and the game's presentation, calling it [...] "beyond stale and outdated." [...] Mazique enjoyed the EASHL mode, but felt that the player creation feature was limited in options. SB Nation writer SkyonAir, of the Stanley Cup of Chowder blog, praised the player and team creators as well as the gameplay overhaul for goaltenders. While he criticized the beta's lack of game modes offered, he recommended the game to readers.|$|E

On selecting Elba, del Toro stated: [...] "This is a {{movie where}} I have {{had to deal with}} more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who do I want to hear say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?" [...] In another interview, the director said: [...] "I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [...] I wanted somebody <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> a lot of authority, but that you could feel {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that." [...] To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart.
