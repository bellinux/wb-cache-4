40|$|Ireland {{announced}} that case numbers have decreased for 20 weeks ending 15 December 2002 {{and that the}} prevalence of BSE test positives have also continued to decrease. The Irish Delegation also {{announced that}} the additional controls introduced in 1996 / 1997 have been effective in preventing exposure, as {{a shift in the}} age profile of cases towards older age categories has been observed. 2. INFORMATION ABOUT A MODIFICATION TO THE BIO-RAD PLATELIA BSE TEST The Commission informed the Member States about the development of a second version of the “Bio-Rad Platelia ” test, which has been approved for <b>TSE</b> <b>monitoring</b> of bovine, ovine and caprine animals. The change of the test’s name into “Bio-Rad TeSeE ” was also announced...|$|E
40|$|Currently, 12 rapid BSE {{test kits}} are {{approved}} by the EC for the routine post mortem testing of slaughtered cattle over 30 months of age {{in accordance with the}} TSE Regulation (EC) No 999 / 2001. The EC is considering launching a new open call for expression of interest for rapid tests for use in the framework of <b>TSE</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Therefore, the EFSA was requested to update the current protocols for the laboratory evaluation and field trial, taking into account experience gained in past evaluation rounds. The experts of the BIOHAZ panel conclude that the revised evaluation protocol takes into account, experience gained in previous evaluation rounds, knowledge accumulated in recent years with the active surveillance program, constraints such as practicability and potential availability of biological material. This protocol ensures that newly approved tests will not be inferior to previously approved BSE post mortem screening tests. The criteria in this revised protocol introduce more comprehensive and higher standards than have previously been approved for validation of cattle post mortem BSE tests which will allow a more comprehensive evaluation of the test’s performance (analytical sensitivity). Since the last rapid test evaluation two new forms of TSE in cattle have been reported in different E...|$|E
40|$|The Cattle <b>TSE</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Model (C-TSEMM), {{developed}} for EFSA by a contractor, allows evaluating different {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) monitoring regimes (implemented or hypothetical) in cattle {{and the ability of}} those schemes to detect either the re-emergence of BSE or {{the emergence of a new}} transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) disease in cattle, by estimating the trend of the current BSE epidemic within European Union Member States. C-TSEMM was developed as a transparent and flexible software package in R, supported by a user-friendly interface in VBA for users to input parameter estimates and alternative monitoring scenarios. The model has been applied to assess the minimum sample size to test in different BSE monitoring scenarios in certain Member States, and to assess the added value of that sample size for monitoring the trend of BSE and the emergence of a hypothetical new type of cattle TSE. C-TSEMM includes BSE data for two example countries (country MM, representing a medium-sized country with TSE testing started in 2003 and some BSE positive findings; country LL, representing a large-sized country with TSE testing started in 2002 and a high number of BSE positive findings). C-TSEMM can be run with those fictitious data, or after inclusion of real data for any country of interest by the user...|$|E
40|$|International audienceScrapie, a {{neurodegenerative}} disease of {{sheep and goats}} and one of several transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (<b>TSEs)</b> and <b>monitored</b> in EU through has been subject to mandatory active surveillance since 2002. Regulation EC/ 999 / 2001 on TSE surveillance requires that each Member State's National Reference Laboratory for TSE periodically verifies diagnostic standards and methods by comparative testing. In 2007 the Italian Reference Centre carried out the first ring trial for classical scrapie {{on a set of}} 21 negative and 9 positive homogenated brainstems, the latter consisting of 3 replicates of an ARQ/ARQ scrapie positive sample diluted 1 : 10, 1 : 20 and 1 : 50. The {{purpose of the study was}} to verify the interlaboratory agreement in term of Cohen's (k) of the rapid systems currently used by the 25 national rapid test laboratories (RTLs) [laboratories: Biorad TeSeE (17 laboratories), Enfer TSE version 2. 0 (4 laboratories), Idexx Herd chek BSE-scrapie antigen kit (3 laboratories) and Prionics check LIA SR (1 laboratory) ]...|$|R
40|$|In {{many studies}} {{worldwide}} {{the use of}} treated sewage effluents (TSE) as water and nutrient sources in agricultural irrigation have been introduced as a viable alternative for wastewater destination in the environment. Considering agronomic and environmental aspects the objectives of this review were: (i) to present an overview of TSE irrigation on different agro-systems (annual crops, orchards, forests and forages); and (ii) to show the principal changes on chemical, physical and microbiological soil characteristics after TSE application. Various studies have revealed that the nutrient supply only by TSE irrigation was not sufficient to meet plant nutrient requirements resulting in yield decreases. The problem could be solved by an adapted effluent/fertilizer management. Moreover, TSE could generally substitute efficiently freshwater for irrigation. Regarding soil quality conditions, TSE irrigation affected mainly: (i) total soil carbon and nitrogen, and mineral nitrogen in soil solution; (ii) microbial activity, composition of microbial communities and their function; (iii) exchangeable calcium and magnesium; (iv) salinity, sodicity, clay dispersion and hydraulic conductivity. Other soil parameters considered in this review (e. g. heavy metals) did not present significant changes over short and medium terms. Due to the often observed accumulation of sodium and nitrogen losses (leaching, volatilization and denitrification) after <b>TSE</b> irrigation, the <b>monitoring</b> of these components is of crucial importance for a sustainable use. Finally, further studies on the technical-economical-environmental viability of TSE irrigation are required to establish reliable recommendations for TSE use particularly in Brazilian agro-systems...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recent {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that the properties Traditional Chinese Medicine is mostly associated with are substance and energy metabolism. Our study aimed to compare the effect of red ginseng (RG) (warm property) and ginseng leaves (GL; cold property) on the substance and energy metabolism of rats with hypothyroidism. Materials and methods: Rats were administered propylthiouracil intraperitoneally for 20 d to cause hypothyroidism. The reference group was orally administered Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparaia [FZ (Fuzi in Chinese) ], while both the RG and GL groups were orally administrated crude drugs. The rectal, tail, toe, and axilla temperature of the rats were assayed every 3 d. Oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, heat production, and energy expenditure were measured via <b>TSE</b> phenoMaster/LabMaster animal <b>monitoring</b> system. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, Na+-K+-ATPase, fumarase, pyruvic acid and cyclic adenosine monophosphate/cyclic guanosine monophosphate were determined. Results: The lower levels of triiodothyronine, tetraiodothyronine, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone and the higher level of thyroid stimulating hormone revealed the successful establishment of a hypothyroidism model. Oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, heat production, and energy expenditure in the FZ and RG groups were obviously increased. The activity of Na+-K+-ATPase and fumarase in the FZ and RG groups was significantly increased. The cyclic adenosine monophosphate/cyclic guanosine monophosphate level in the FZ and RG groups was increased, while the GL group showed the opposite. Conclusion: Our research provides {{a new way to}} explore the efficiency of Chinese medicine {{on the basis of the}} relationship between drug property and effects on substance and energy metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Bovine {{intestines}} and mesenteries in the European Union (EU) have to {{be removed}} from the food and feed chain. The opinion provides a quantitative assessment of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) infectious load that might enter the food and feed chain yearly if bovine intestine and mesentery from animals {{born and raised in the}} EU would be re-allowed for consumption. Data on the evolution of the BSE infectious titre; and of the weight of histological structures accumulating BSE infectivity, were collected. The Cattle <b>TSE</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Model (C-TSEMM) was used to estimate the number of BSE infected cattle entering undetected in the food and feed chain yearly. A model named TSEi was developed to estimates the BSE infectious load in tissues from infected animals at different ages and the total yearly infectious load that could enter the food and feed chain in the EU 27. In BSE infected cattle, the infectivity associated with intestine and mesentery reaches its maximum in animals younger than 18 months and then progressively declines to a minimum value in animals older than 60 months. Due to the decline of the BSE prevalence in the EU, between 2007 and 2012, the yearly amount of BSE infectivity associated with intestine and mesentery (sent to destruction) from animals entering the food and feed chain was reduced by a factor of 10. However, over this period, the maximum level of exposure to the BSE agent for individuals that would have consumed these tissues remained stable. Finally, th...|$|E
40|$|This Scientific Report of EFSA {{provides}} {{scientific and}} technical assistance to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Surveillance Authority in evaluating i) if the Norwegian continuous use of fishmeal in feed for ruminants until 30 April 2010 has {{had an impact on}} the overall risk of BSE in the country; and ii) if a proposed Norwegian revised annual monitoring programme for BSE allows the detection of BSE with a yearly design prevalence of at least one case per 100, 000 in the adult population at a confidence level of 95 %. Data related to the implementation of the Norwegian feed ban were collected and assessed. The Cattle <b>TSE</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Model (C-TSEMM) was used in order to answer the second term of reference of the mandate received. It is concluded that the use of fishmeal in feed for ruminants might have had a potential impact on the risk of cattle exposure to BSE in Norway. While it is not possible to quantitatively assess this risk, the lack of detection of BSE cases by the Norwegian monitoring system (in spite of its sensitivity limits) suggests that BSE has not significantly spread in the Norwegian cattle population. The proposed revised Norwegian BSE monitoring regime would not be able to meet a yearly design prevalence of at least one case per 100, 000 in the adult cattle population at a confidence level of 95 %. Moreover, in statistical terms it is not feasible for Norway to achieve the requested design prevalence. It is furthermore highlighted that passing from a sample-based to an exhaustive monitoring scheme (i. e. testing all animals over a certain age that are slaughtered or dead) would provide the most sensitive BSE surveillance system currently possible...|$|E
