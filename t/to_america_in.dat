5|$|Charles E. Barber {{was born}} in London in 1840. His grandfather, John Barber, led the family <b>to</b> <b>America</b> <b>in</b> the early 1850s.

The Barber family initially lived in Boston upon their arrival to the United States, though they later moved to Providence to allow William {{to work for the}} Gorham Manufacturing Company. William Barber's skills {{came to the attention of}} Mint Chief Engraver James B.

5|$|Hinde {{dedicated}} {{a substantial}} amount of time to investigating the Madoc Tradition in North America. Madoc or Madog ab Owain Gwynedd was, according to folklore, a Welsh prince who sailed <b>to</b> <b>America</b> <b>in</b> 1170, more than 300 years before Christopher Columbus's voyage in 1492. Hinde interviewed hundreds of individuals on the topic. In 1824, Hinde wrote a letter to John S. Williams, editor of The American Pioneer regarding the Madoc Tradition. He claimed to have testimony from numerous sources that said Welsh people under Owen Ap Zuinch had come <b>to</b> <b>America</b> <b>in</b> the twelfth century, over 300 years before Christopher Columbus. Hinde claimed that in 1799, the remains of six soldiers had been dug up near Jeffersonville, Indiana with breastplates containing Welsh coats of arms. In 1799, John Sevier, the first governor of Tennessee, also wrote of the alleged discovery of six skeletons in brass armor bearing Welsh coat-of-arms. Hinde claimed that M'Intosh recounted that American Indians and Welshmen living on the Mississippi River were conversing in Welsh in the late 1700s.|$|E
5|$|On {{her return}} <b>to</b> <b>America</b> <b>in</b> 1898, Barrymore was lauded {{by the press}} and public and, under Charles Frohman's management, she {{appeared}} in Catherine (1898) and Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines (1901) on Broadway. The latter play was a success, and Barrymore received particular praise. She went on to {{have a series of}} similarly popular roles in Cousin Kate (1903), Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire (1905), Lady Frederick (1908) and Déclassée (1920), among others. After a series of less well-received roles in the early 1920s, she returned to popularity with her role as the sophisticated spouse of a philandering husband in The Constant Wife (1927). In 1928 the Ethel Barrymore Theatre was opened in her honor, and she appeared in its inaugural production, The Kingdom of God.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable Crabbet-bred stallions Brown {{eventually}} kept at Maynesboro was *Astraled, who had come <b>to</b> <b>America</b> <b>in</b> 1909.

5|$|The first horses on the American {{mainland}} {{since the}} end of the Ice Age arrived with the Spanish Conquistadors.

More horses followed with each new arrival of Conquistadors, missionaries, and settlers. Many horses escaped or were stolen, becoming the foundation stock of the American Mustang.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 10, Kunis {{auditioned for}} but failed to get {{the role of a}} Russian Jewish girl who moves <b>to</b> <b>America</b> <b>in</b> the film Make a Wish, Molly. Instead, she was cast in the {{secondary}} role of a Mexican girl. In 1998, Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show. All who auditioned were required to be at least 18 years old; Kunis, who was 14 at the time, told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not say when. Though they eventually figured it out, the producers still thought Kunis was the best fit for the role. That '70s Show ran for eight seasons. She won two consecutive Young Star Awards as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances.|$|E
5|$|Construction for the Independência (officially Estádio Raimundo Sampaio) {{started in}} 1947 in {{preparation}} for the 1950 FIFA World Cup, during which its first match was played. Originally the property of the State Government of Minas Gerais, ownership was transferred to Sete de Setembro FC in 1965, when the Mineirão was built, and the property passed <b>to</b> <b>América</b> <b>in</b> 1997, when it absorbed Sete de Setembro. Before the Mineirão, the stadium was the largest in Belo Horizonte — holding up to 30,000 people — and was preferred by Atlético over the older and smaller Antônio Carlos stadium. After the Mineirão's construction, however, Atlético did not use the Estádio do Horto (as it is also known) for decades, except for a brief spell in the late 1990s. The stadium was renovated in 2012, while the Mineirão was closed, having its capacity reduced to 23,018. In that year, Atlético announced a deal with BWA Arenas, the stadium manager. The club signed a contract to use the Independência as its home ground for 10 years, which has happened since then, except in important and high-attendance matches.|$|E

5|$|George Mason's great-grandfather, George Mason I, {{had been}} a Cavalier: militarily {{defeated}} in the English Civil War, some of them came <b>to</b> <b>America</b> <b>in</b> the 1640s and 1650s. He {{had been born in}} 1629 at Pershore, in the English county of Worcestershire. The immigrant George Mason settled in what is now Stafford County, Virginia, having obtained land as a reward for bringing his party to the colony as 50 acres were awarded for each person transported into the Colony of Virginia. His son, George Mason II (1660–1716), was the first to move to what in 1742 became Fairfax County, then at the frontier between English and Native American areas. George Mason III (1690–1735) served in the House of Burgesses and, like his father, was county lieutenant. George Mason IV's mother, Ann Thomson Mason, was the daughter of a former Attorney General of Virginia who had immigrated from London and was of a Yorkshire family.|$|E
5|$|In America, {{he again}} tried {{his hand at}} journalism, but a brief stint {{as editor of the}} New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung {{resulted}} only in getting the paper suspended and landing himself a rather large fine. On March 31, 1905, he recited poetry at a benefit performance at Cooper Union to raise a pension for Yiddish poet Eliakum Zunser, even worse off than himself because he had found himself unable to write since coming <b>to</b> <b>America</b> <b>in</b> 1889. Shortly afterwards, he met a group of young people who had a Hebrew language association at the Dr. Herzl Zion Club, and wrote a Hebrew-language play David ba-Milchama (David in the War), which they performed in March 1906, the first Hebrew-language play to be performed in America. Repeat performances in March 1907 and April 1908 drew successively larger crowds.|$|E
5|$|Leslie Richard Groves Jr. {{was born}} in Albany, New York, on 17 August 1896, the third son of four {{children}} of a pastor, Leslie Richard Groves Sr., and his wife Gwen née Griffith. A descendant of French Huguenots who came <b>to</b> <b>America</b> <b>in</b> the 17th century, Leslie Groves Sr. resigned as pastor of the Sixth Presbyterian church in Albany in December 1896 to become a United States Army chaplain. He was posted to the 14th Infantry at Vancouver Barracks in Washington in 1897. Following {{the outbreak of the}} Spanish–American War in 1898, Chaplain Groves was sent to Cuba with the 8th Infantry. On returning to Vancouver Barracks, he was ordered to rejoin the 14th Infantry in the Philippines; service in the Philippine–American War and the Boxer Rebellion followed. The 14th Infantry returned to the United States in 1901 and moved to Fort Snelling, Minnesota. The family relocated to there from Vancouver, then moved to Fort Hancock, New Jersey, the next year, and returned to Vancouver in 1905. Chaplain Groves was hospitalized with tuberculosis at Fort Bayard in 1905. He decided to settle in southern California and bought a house in Altadena. His next posting was to Fort Apache, Arizona. The family spent their summers there and returned to Altadena where the children attended school.|$|E
