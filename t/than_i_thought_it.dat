500|$|The album debuted at No. 122 on the Billboard 200 chart {{with first}} week sales of just under 10,000 units. Since its release in May 2003, We've Come For You All sold about 62,000 copies in the United States. Apart from {{entering}} the French Albums Chart at number 95, the record did not manage to chart in any other country. Referring to the low record sales, Ian posted {{a message on the}} band's official web site saying: [...] "That's more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would do after five years away. That's basically what [...] Volume 8 did in its first week and this one was based on mostly just Internet promo." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Green Day {{released}} Insomniac, {{which did}} not perform as well commercially as the band's breakthrough major-label debut Dookie (1994). Speaking of Insomniac, vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong noted, [...] "It did a lot better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was going to do...From the sound of it, we knew it wasn't going to sell as much as Dookie." [...] The group embarked on an extensive world tour to promote Insomniac in early 1996, which saw the band performing in sports arenas that contrasted with the small clubs the group was accustomed to playing. [...] The members became increasingly uncomfortable {{with the level of}} stardom they had attained; Armstrong recalled, [...] "We were becoming the things we hated, playing those big arenas. [...] It was beginning to be not fun anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Was Here" [...] {{begins with}} quivering reverb and a plaintively plucked guitar setting a somber mood for about fifteen {{seconds before the}} beats begin {{alongside}} Beyoncé's voice. Her vocals set a hushed and morbid tone on the song as she bring doses of edge and grit, singing: [...] "I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time / Know {{there was something that}} meant something that I left behind / When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets / I'll leave something to remember, So they won't forget". She further sings throughout the song, [...] "The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leaved that I made a difference". Watery synths shimmer in the background before Beyoncé adopts an authoritative tone to chant the chorus lines: [...] "I was here / I lived, I loved / I was here / I did, I've done / Everything that I wanted / And it was more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be / I will leave my mark so everyone will know / I was here".|$|E

500|$|Madonna's initial work on {{the album}} had started with Shep Pettibone, who {{produced}} her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992). However, she found {{out that they were}} doing the same vein of music from the previous album, which did not please her. At the time, Madonna was a fan of Babyface's song [...] "When Can I See You" [...] (1994), and became interested in working with him, as she wanted [...] "lush ballads" [...] for her record. They would collaborate on three songs for the album in his studio in Beverly Hills, with [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] ending up on the album. Recalling the latter's development, the producer commented, [...] "I wasn't so much thinking about the charts. I think I was more in awe of the fact that I was working with Madonna. It was initially surreal, but then you get to know the person a little bit, and you calm down and then it's just work. And work is fun". He also said that for [...] "Forbidden Love", [...] "She heard the basic track and it all started coming out, melodies and everything... It was a much easier process <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be".|$|E
500|$|During the U.S. third leg, it was {{reported}} that Born to Run would be featured in its entirety during several shows, possibly in a scheme to boost ticket sales. [...] The full-album idea took fruition with the late September-early October set of five shows at Giants Stadium, which would be the final concerts ever in that venue in Springsteen's home state. [...] Born to Run was played at two shows, Darkness on the Edge of Town at one show, and Born in the U.S.A. at two shows. [...] Springsteen later said of the full album idea, [...] "We had done so many shows and were going to come back around one more time, so we were like, 'OK, what can we do that we haven't done? Let's try to play some of the albums.' There were some people who were starting to do it, it sounded like a good idea, and my audience fundamentally experienced all my music in album form. People took Born to Run home and played it start to finish 100 times; they didn't slip on a cut in the middle. And we made albums – we took a long time, and we built them to last. ... Those records are packed with songs that have lasted 30–35 years. It simply was a way to revitalize the show and do something appealing and fun for the fans, but it ended up being a much bigger emotional experience <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be." ...|$|E
500|$|Shonda Rhimes, series' creator, {{says that}} the {{character}} was envisioned [...] "an old-fashioned tortured hero" [...] and likens him to Heathcliff. Originally set to appear in a multi-episode story arc, Kevin McKidd's contract was extended, securing him a slot as a series' regular of Grey's Anatomy. In July 2008, Entertainment Weekly announced the possibility of McKidd becoming a series' regular, with this possibility eventually being confirmed by People. When asked of how he got involved with the show, McKidd offered the insight: [...] McKidd told BuddyTV, [...] "It's been really great. I was nervous when I started because every job I've ever done before this, I {{have been in the}} job right from day one when everybody's new and getting to know each other. So I was nervous because I had never done this before. And I feel really grateful to the Grey's cast and crew and everyone there, really, because they've been so nice to me and gracious and accepting of me joining the show. The transition was much easier <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> might be, which I'm very grateful for." [...] McKidd has told People that he thinks Grey's Anatomy is a great show and he feels lucky to be on it. Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, said of his addition, [...] "I am excited to have Kevin McKidd joining us for the season, he's been a delight to collaborate with and brings incredible passion, talent and creativity to his work. Plus, he’s already got the ‘Mc’ built into his name so we had to keep him." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Sony and Capcom greenlit a Resident Evil {{film with}} George A. Romero {{signed on as}} the film's {{director}} and screenplay writer. Romero's association with Capcom, the Resident Evil video game series creators, had extended from 1998 when Romero directed an ad campaign for Biohazard 2 (Resident Evil 2) in Japan. Romero stated in an official appearance in Universal Studios' Talk City chatroom that he had his secretary play the entire game through and record the gameplay so he could study it as a resource. [...] Romero's screenplay {{was based on the}} first Resident Evil game and included characters from the video games. Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine were the lead characters, involved in a romantic relationship. Barry Burton, Rebecca Chambers, Ada Wong, and Albert Wesker were to also appear. [...] The ending to the film would have been {{similar to that of the}} best ending to the first Resident Evil game. Romero's script was disapproved of and production was placed into development hell. Capcom producer Yoshiki Okamoto explained to the editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly that [...] "Romero's script wasn't good, so Romero was fired". [...] In February 2000, Romero revealed in an interview with DGA magazine that [...] "I don't think they were into the spirit of the video game and wanted to make it more of a war movie, something heavier <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> should be. So I think they just never liked my script." [...] As Romero's script was a close, but not full, adaptation of the game, Capcom believed fans would feel that the film had been altered too much from the game and that newcomers would dislike the premise.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968 Corea read Dianetics, Hubbard's most {{well known}} {{self-help}} book, {{and in the}} early 1970s developed an interest in Hubbard's science fiction novels. [...] "I came into contact with L. Ron Hubbard's material in 1968 with Dianetics and it kind of opened my mind up and it got me into seeing that my potential for communication was a lot greater <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was."The two exchanged letters until Hubbard's death in 1986, and Corea had three guest appearances on Hubbard's 1982 album Space Jazz: The Soundtrack of the Book Battlefield Earth, noting, [...] " [...] was a great composer and keyboard player as well. He did many, many things. He was a true Renaissance Man." [...] Corea said that Scientology became a profound influence on his musical direction in the early 1970s: [...] "I no longer wanted to satisfy myself. I really want to connect with the world and make my music mean something to people." ...|$|E
2500|$|May later blamed {{her actions}} on fatigue and insisted she hadn't {{had too much}} to drink. [...] "I didn't have a lot of wine," [...] May said, [...] "but it may have hit me harder <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would". When {{questioned}} if she should resign, May responded that [...] "a lot of people have given bad press gallery speeches and have gone on to be Prime Minister or gone on to lead other aspects of their lives, time will tell." [...] May was quick to admit that her remarks at the annual press gallery dinner in Gatineau, Que., were a poor attempt at comedy. However, she said they shouldn't detract from her political track record. [...] President of the Treasury Board Tony Clement and NDP House Leader Peter Julian said Monday afternoon that May's apology was sufficient. [...] "Look, she's apologized which was appropriate and I'm going to leave the matter at that," [...] Clement told reporters. Laura Peck, senior partner at TransformLeaders.ca, said, [...] "She has apologized. She's done the right thing, she's apologized," [...] Peck said. [...] "One mistake is forgivable, two is a pattern." [...] It's more of an [...] "inside Ottawa beltway" [...] thing anyway, Peck added.|$|E
