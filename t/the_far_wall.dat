25|$|Van Gogh {{depicted}} the view {{at different times}} of day and under various weather conditions, including sunrise, moonrise, sunshine-filled days, overcast days, windy days, and one day with rain. While the hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, he was able there to make sketches in ink or charcoal on paper; eventually he would base newer variations on previous versions. The pictorial element uniting all of these paintings is the diagonal line coming in from the right depicting the low rolling hills of the Alpilles mountains. In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress trees are visible beyond <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall</b> enclosing the wheat field. Van Gogh telescoped the view in six of these paintings, most notably in F717 Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night, bringing the trees closer to the picture plane.|$|E
25|$|This {{new concept}} in lock design {{has yet to}} be {{installed}} on any waterway. It is basically a shaft lock with a diagonal shaft. The proposal is for a long tube of reinforced concrete, of a size to accommodate the boats being lifted, to be built on the slope between the upper and lower levels. The bottom of the tube is sealed with a strong watertight door, but there is a single pair of conventional lock gates at the top, installed a boat's length from <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall</b> of the tube. The change in level is achieved by filling the tube with water from the top pound, or by draining. The vessel floats {{on the surface of the}} water, with a guide float or pontoon, shaped to fit the tube, floating alongside to keep it clear of the walls. Side ponds, piped from the main tube, are incorporated to save water. In replacing a traditional flight or staircase of locks, a considerable time saving is anticipated. It differs from the similar caisson lock design in that the boat does not have to be carried in a submerged chamber.|$|E

60|$|The {{sight that}} met his eyes must have frozen him with horror, for there, within the door, stood three great bull apes, while behind them crowded many more; how many he never knew, for his revolvers were hanging on <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall</b> beside his rifle, and Kerchak was charging.|$|E
60|$|He opened {{what seemed}} to be a little {{mahogany}} box, looked at the ball of black substance inside, closed it up, placed it against <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall,</b> untwisted the coil, stood back near the door and pressed the button. The result was extraordinary. The whole of <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall</b> was blown out and for some distance in front the ground was furrowed up by the explosion. Quest replaced the instrument in his pocket, sprang through the opening and ran for the tower house. Behind him, on its way to New York, he could see a freight train coming along. He could hear, too, Red Gallagher's roar of anger. It was less than fifty yards, yet already, as he reached the shelter of the tower, the thunder of the freight sounded in Quest's ears. He glanced around. Red Gallagher and his mate were racing almost beside it towards him. He rushed up the narrow stairs into the signal room, tearing open his coat to show his official badge.|$|E

60|$|While he {{was cutting}} up the dead bodies of animals, I settled myself down, after {{exploring}} the dak-bungalow. There were three rooms, beside my own, {{which was a}} corner kennel, each giving into the other through dingy white doors fastened with long iron bars. The bungalow was a very solid one, but the partition walls of the rooms were almost jerry-built in their flimsiness. Every step or bang of a trunk echoed from my room down the other three, and every footfall came back tremulously from <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>walls.</b> For this reason I shut the door. There were no lamps--only candles in long glass shades. An oil wick was set in the bathroom.|$|R

60|$|As a {{practical}} move, the action had flaws. The shots cannot have gone anywhere near their vague target. But as a demonstration, {{it was a}} wonderful success.

40|$|Background: Antibodies against cardiolipin and {{phosphatidylserine}} (anti-CL and anti-PS) {{are associated}} with thrombosis.

40|$|PurposeTo test a {{computer-aided}} {{diagnostic method}} for differentiating symptomatic from asymptomatic carotid B-mode ultrasonographic images. MethodsOur system (called Atheromatic) automatically computed the intima-media thickness (IMT) of <b>the</b> carotid <b>far</b> <b>wall</b> using AtheroEdge, calculated nonlinear features based on higher order spectra, and used these features and IMT and IMT variability (IMTVpoly) to associate each image to a feature vector {{that was then}} labeled as symptomatic or asymptomatic (Sym/Asym) by a multiclassifiers system. We tested this method on a database of 118 carotid artery images from 37 symptomatic and 22 asymptomatic patients ResultsThe highest accuracy (99. 1) was obtained by the support vector machine classifier using seven features. These features, relevant to discriminate Sym/Asym, included IMT and IMTVpoly, along with the bispectral entropies of the distal wall image at 77 degrees, 78 degrees, and 79 degrees angles.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Besides {{effects on}} hemostasis, vitamin K-dependent {{proteins}} {{play a role}} in bone mineralization and arterial calcification. We investigated the association between the VKORC 1 1173 C>T polymorphism and calcification of <b>the</b> aortic <b>far</b> <b>wall</b> in a large population-based cohort. METHODS AND RESULTS: Aortic calcification was diagnosed by radiographic detection of calcified deposits in the abdominal aorta. In all cohort members for whom DNA was available, the C 1173 T SNP of VKORC 1 (rs 9934438) was determined. With multivariable logistic regression analysis the association between this polymorphism and the risk of aortic calcification was calculated, adjusted for potential confounders. The T allele frequency of the VKORC 1 1173 C>T polymorphism was 38. 8 %. 1185 (37. 2 %) persons were homozygous CC, 1529 (48, 0 %) were heterozygous CT and 473 (14. 8 %) were homozygous TT. Persons with at least one T-allele had a statistically significant 19 % (95 % CI 2 to 40 %) risk increase of calcification of <b>the</b> aortic <b>far</b> <b>wall</b> compared to CC homozygous persons, adjusted for age and gender. CONCLUSIONS: The T-allele of the VKORC 1 1173 C>T polymorphism was associated with a significantly higher risk of aortic calcification in Whites...|$|R
