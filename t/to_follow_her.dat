5|$|After {{several more}} French {{attempts}} at conciliation had failed, in September 1664 Marguerite Louise left her apartment in Palazzo Pitti, refusing to return. As a result, Cosimo moved her into Villa di Lappeggi. {{where she was}} watched by forty soldiers, and where six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>her</b> everywhere because it was feared she would abscond. The following year, she changed tack, and was reconciled with the Grand Ducal family. That particular reconciliation collapsed, however, after the birth in 1667 of Anna Maria Luisa.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, President Bartlet {{tries to}} persuade Ellie {{to speak to}} the press to contain the incidence, but Ellie insists she is not as {{comfortable}} with the spotlight as {{the other members of the}} family.

This inspires her <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>her</b> father's advice, and give a passionate public statement about the necessity of a politically independent scientific community.|$|E
5|$|Reportedly, Tiberius once {{ran into}} Vipsania again, and {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>her</b> home crying and begging forgiveness; soon afterwards, Tiberius met with Augustus, and steps {{were taken to}} ensure that Tiberius and Vipsania would never meet again. Tiberius continued to be elevated by Augustus, and after Agrippa's death and his brother Drusus' death in 9BC, seemed the clear candidate for succession. As such, in 12BC he received military commissions in Pannonia and Germania; both areas highly volatile and of key importance to Augustan policy.|$|E

Mary's first Parliament, which assembled in early October 1553, declared the marriage of her parents valid and abolished Edward's religious laws. Church doctrine was restored to the form it had taken in the 1539 Six Articles, which (among other things) re-affirmed clerical celibacy. Married priests were deprived of their benefices.|$|E

5|$|Ferdinando beseeched Louis XIV to do {{something}} about his daughter-in-law's behaviour; he sent the Comte de Saint Mêmê. Marguerite Louise wanted to return to France, and Mêmê sympathised with this, as did much of the French court, so he left without finding a solution to the heir's domestic disharmony, incensing both Ferdinando and Louis XIV. She humiliated Cosimo at every chance she got: she insisted on employing French cooks, as she feared the Medici would poison her. In September 1664 Marguerite Louise abandoned her apartments in the Pitti, the grand ducal palace. Cosimo moved her into Villa Lapeggi. Here, she was watched by forty soldiers, and six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>her</b> everywhere. The next year she reconciled with the grand ducal family, and gave birth to Anna Maria Luisa, future Electress Palatine, in August 1667. The delicate rapprochement that existed between Marguerite Louise {{and the rest of the}} family collapsed after Anna Maria Luisa's birth, when Marguerite Louise caught smallpox and decided to blame Cosimo for all her problems.|$|E
5|$|From a young age, Imogen Holst showed {{precocious}} {{talent in}} composing and performance. After attending Eothen School and St Paul's Girls' School, {{she entered the}} Royal College of Music, where she developed her skills as a conductor and won several prizes for composing. Unable for health reasons <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>her</b> initial ambitions to be a pianist or a dancer, Imogen {{spent most of the}} 1930s teaching, and as a full-time organiser for the English Folk Dance and Song Society.

After serving as an organiser for the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts {{at the start of the}} Second World War, in 1942 she began working at Dartington.

After Rayne lost the Knockouts Championship to James at Lockdown, James agreed to give her a rematch on the condition that if she is unable to regain the title, Tara would be released from her contract with Rayne. On May 15 at Sacrifice, Tara became a fan favorite after knocking out Rayne during her match with James, costing her the Knockouts Championship and guaranteeing herself a release from her contract with Rayne.|$|E
