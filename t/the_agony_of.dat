5|$|To {{compound}} <b>the</b> <b>agony</b> <b>of</b> his defeat, Adams' son Charles, {{a long-time}} alcoholic, died in late November. Anxious to rejoin Abigail, {{who had already}} left for Massachusetts, Adams departed the White House in the predawn hours of March 4, 1801, and did not attend Jefferson's inauguration. Since him, only three out-going presidents (having served a full term) have not attended their successor's inauguration.|$|E

All <b>the</b> <b>agony</b> <b>of</b> the {{disintegration}} of his government was gone, {{and he seemed to}} be a giant revived by his contact with the people. This was Diefenbaker's finest election. He was virtually alone on the hustings. Even such loyalists as Gordon Churchill had to stick close to their own bailiwicks, where they were fighting for their political lives.|$|E

By 17 April, Phnom Penh had fallen and the nation slid into darkness. In the new Year Zero, the Khmer Rouge, under the leadership of Pol Pot, began its descent into mass murder and auto-genocide.|$|E

5|$|The intelligence, domesticability and {{versatility}} of {{the elephant}} gave it considerable advantages over other wild {{animals such as}} lions and bears used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than horses: while a horse can be trained to charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of war elephants with generals such as Hannibal. Elephants can be trained to execute prisoners {{in a variety of}} ways, and can be taught to prolong <b>the</b> <b>agony</b> <b>of</b> the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.|$|E
5|$|United {{suffered}} <b>the</b> <b>agony</b> <b>of</b> reaching {{three out}} of four Scottish Cup finals in the mid-1980s, only to lose them all by a single goal. First came a 2–1 defeat to Celtic in 1984–85, compounded by a 1–0 League Cup final loss to Rangers in the same season; then a 1–0 defeat in extra time to St Mirren in 1986–87; and finally, a last-minute 2–1 loss against Celtic the following year, despite being a goal ahead. A three-year gap ensued before the 1990–91 Scottish Cup final, which pitted Jim McLean against his brother Tommy, at Motherwell. The final was won 4–3 by 'Well, with United again losing in extra time. The sixth Cup Final loss was also the club's fifth final appearance in eleven years.|$|E

25|$|After a few {{generations of}} {{existing}} within the Roman systems, the Jewish desire for independence did finally come to a head and resulted in the Bar Kobha revolt in 132-135 CE. In Jewish tradition, the temple was seen as indestructible and a physical manifestation {{of the power of}} God and God’s connection to the Jewish people. With its destruction, Jews resorted to the traditional explanation that they had transgressed and were being punished for their sins. The religious reaction to the destruction was evident through changes in halakhah (Jewish Law), midrashim, and 2 Baruch, all of which mention <b>the</b> <b>agony</b> <b>of</b> the temple’s destruction.|$|E
25|$|Worcestershire Royals {{took their}} second {{successive}} one-run victory over Warwickshire Bears, to <b>the</b> <b>agony</b> <b>of</b> home fans at Edgbaston. After Heath Streak took two early wickets, Neil Carter entered {{the scene as}} the sixth bowler to be used. He took five wickets inside four overs, for 19 runs, as Worcestershire were all out for 141 with seven balls to spare. In reply, two run outs and wickets from Gareth Batty and Zander de Bruyn left Warwickshire trailing by 60 with one wicket in hand, with Heath Streak and James Anyon at the crease. Streak rotated the strike well, facing most of the balls and hitting most of the runs, and brought the score to 140 for 9 with a ball to spare. Then - setting off for the last run that would tie the scores (and win the match for Warwickshire on fewer wickets lost) - Streak was run out for 59, off 32 balls, and Warwickshire's quarter-final hopes were dented, but not wiped out.|$|E

25|$|Thus by the 13th {{century the}} tender joys of the Nativity of Jesus {{were added to}} <b>the</b> <b>agony</b> <b>of</b> his Crucifixion and a whole new range of {{approved}} religious emotions were ushered in, with wide ranging cultural impacts for centuries thereafter. The Franciscans approached both ends of this spectrum of emotions. On one hand {{the introduction of the}} Nativity scene encouraged the tender image of Jesus, while on the other hand Francis of Assisi himself had a deep attachment to the sufferings of Jesus on the Cross and was said to have received the Stigmata as an expression of that love. The dual nature of Franciscan piety based both on joy of Nativity and the sacrifice at Calvary had a deep appeal among city dwellers and as the Franciscan Friars travelled, these emotions spread across the world, transforming the Kyrios image of Jesus to a more tender, loving, and compassionate image. These traditions did not remain limited to Europe and soon spread to the {{other parts of the world}} such as Latin America, the Philippines and the United States.|$|E
