5|$|Frustrated at the competition's outcome, Leech on June 11, 1891 {{instructed}} Barber {{to prepare}} {{designs for the}} half dollar, quarter, and dime. As the Morgan dollar was then being heavily struck, the Mint director decided <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> design unaltered for the time being. For the obverse of the new coins, Leech suggested a depiction of Liberty similar to that on the French coins of the period; he was content that the current reverses be continued. Leech had previously suggested to Barber that he engage outside help if the work was {{to be done at}} the Mint; the chief engraver replied that he was aware of no one who could be of help in the preparation of new designs. Leech had spoken with Saint-Gaudens on the same subject; the sculptor stated that only four men in the world were capable of executing high-quality coin designs; three lived in France and he was the fourth.|$|E
25|$|In that case, Rehnquist went on, {{it would}} not {{necessarily}} have been a constitutional violation for an adverse action to have resulted even significantly from protected activity. The Court did not want <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> reading in place, since it would allow a misbehaving employee to insulate themselves from adverse action by engaging in protected conduct.|$|E
25|$|A visa is a {{conditional}} authorization {{granted by}} {{a country to}} a foreigner, allowing them to enter and temporarily remain within, or <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> country.

25|$|The {{capture of}} the Harriet Lane {{involved}} also possibly the oldest active combatant of the Civil War. Captain Levi C. Harby of the Texas Maritime Service, 69 years old, was {{in command of the}} Neptune, and was the last <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> vessel after ramming the Harriet Lane portside. The Neptune was hit by Federal gunners and sank, but the water was shallow enough that Harby and his men could continue firing their guns from her deck. This distraction enabled the Bayou City to carry out the successful starboard attack that captured the Harriet Lane.|$|E
25|$|The {{evacuation}} of the internees began on February 11. Sixty-four U.S army and navy nurses interned in Santo Tomas {{were the first}} <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> day and board airplanes for the United States. Flights and ships to the United States for most internees began on February 22. Although food became adequate {{with the arrival of}} American soldiers, life continued to be difficult. The lingering effects of near-starvation for so many months saw 48 people die in the camp in February, the highest death total for any month.|$|E
25|$|After a sub-standard {{start to}} the 1983–84 season, Aberdeen's form {{improved}} and the team won the Scottish league and retained the Scottish Cup. Ferguson was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1985 New Year Honours, and was offered the managers' jobs at Rangers and Arsenal during the season. Aberdeen retained their league title in the 1984–85 season, but had a disappointing season in 1985–86, finishing fourth in the league, although they did win both domestic cups. Ferguson had been appointed to the club's board of directors early in 1986, but that April he told Dick Donald, their chairman, that he intended <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> summer.|$|E

Later that night Ciprigna is about to depart for the magic island, but hears gunfire and then finds herself locked outside in a huge thunderstorm. Terrified, she begs to be let back into the house, seeks Bonario's forgiveness, and promises to submit to his authority. She is further humiliated when Fiuta reveals {{that he was the}} fictitious ambassador and the family berate her for her foolishness. She acknowledges her debt to Fiuta for bringing about her reform. Giglio is forgiven by the family but sent on his way. Bonario orders a feast to be prepared to celebrate the family's reconciliation.|$|E
25|$|For {{distinguished}} {{conduct in}} the line of his profession, extraordinary courage and disregard of his own life during the attack on the Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, by Japanese forces on 7 December 1941. When his station in the forward dynamo room of the U.S.S. Nevada became almost untenable due to smoke, steam, and heat, Machinist Ross forced his men <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> station and performed all the duties himself until blinded and unconscious. Upon being rescued and resuscitated, he returned and secured the forward dynamo room and proceeded to the after dynamo room where he was later again rendered unconscious by exhaustion. Again recovering consciousness he returned to his station where he remained until directed to abandon it.|$|E
25|$|Hearing that UFO bassist Pete Way was keen <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> band, {{the two met}} {{and decided}} their new band's name would be an {{amalgamation}} of their own two names, resulting in Fastway. They advertised in the music press for a drummer and a vocalist. Meanwhile, a rehearsal was organised for which The Clash drummer, Topper Headon, filled in on drums. Headon was doing this as a favour so that Clarke and Way could rehearse. The ads began showing positive results, cassettes from potential band members arrived; one of these was from a young, Dublin-based singer {{by the name of}} Dave King. Clarke was impressed with his voice and financed a trip to London for King and, after an audition together, he became the Fastway vocalist. Ex-Humble Pie member, Jerry Shirley, became the drummer.|$|E

25|$|It was {{established}} by 10 leaders called Datus (then reduced to 9, since Datu Puti, their leader, disappeared). Datus were high officials (just rendered high-official during the invasion but before the Hindu invasion, Datus were considered co-equal Paramount Rulers of a Kedatuan). They were connected with the court of Indianized native kingdoms of Brunei and Srivijaya, who were forced <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> land on account of enmity with the Rajah, who was ruling the land at that time. The Datus, together with their wives and children, {{as well as a}} few faithful servants and followers; monks, scholars, soldiers were secretly escorted out of the country by the Rajah's Chief Minister, whose name was Datu Puti. The local folklore says that the name of the Bornean Rajah was Makatunao.|$|E

Seward was likely in accord with Johnson's relatively gentle terms for the South's re-entry to the Union, and with his pardon of all Confederates but those of high rank. Radical Republicans such as Stanton and Pennsylvania Representative Thaddeus Stevens proposed that the freed slaves be given the vote, but Seward was content <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> to the states (few Northern states gave African-Americans the ballot), believing the priority should be reconciling the power-holding white populations of the North and South to each other.|$|E

Author Kenneth A. Briggs, former religion editor for The New York Times, wrote that the Mansour case [...] "was in many respects the most dramatic, but not the only, instance of a particular nun singled out for punishment". Theologian Margaret Farley, a Sister of Mercy {{and a professor at}} Yale University, said, [...] "It was a painful truth that [...] had <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> <b>that</b> the church declared her officially not a member.

[...] Olivia Smith of the New York Daily News commented that [...] "Madge has her family– her {{daughter}} and her lover– at her latest party, in which she's still at the hotblooded center of her life." [...] She {{also noted that the}} video exemplifies the fact that Madonna is an artist with a long musical past. However, the tone of the video explains that Madonna is ready <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> past and move forward. According to Smith, although Madonna has toned down her appearance, [...] "the 51-year-old is still her pelvis-swirling overtly sexual self in her new video." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} way the season reveals the name Daredevil, DeKnight {{explained}} that several options had been brought up, such as [...] "one of the versions in the comics where {{when he was a kid}} people used to taunt him with the name Daredevil", which did not fit in the world of the series, or having Ben Urich give the character the name, but the timing for that did not work due to Urich's death before the final Daredevil suit was introduced. It was decided that instead of having the name Daredevil said onscreen, it would be easier to introduce it through the media as a newspaper headline. On why this was not done for Wilson Fisk as Kingpin, DeKnight stated that he felt it would [...] "get a little bit silly.... we went, 'Oh they called him Daredevil! Oh they called him Kingpin!'," [...] and was unable to come up with another natural way for the name Kingpin to come up, so it was decided <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> for a later time.|$|E

500|$|A third {{attempt was}} made in late July, but was again not {{successful}} due to the mechanical troubles and heavy seasickness the Carlins experienced. The Carlins set out for a fourth time in early August, and progressed further, being sighted several days after their launch by an American destroyer almost [...] off of New York. However, the couple soon lost radio contact, prompting Pan-American Airways to direct their crews to search for their craft. Half-Safe and the Carlins were finally rescued approximately [...] off New York by the oil tanker New Jersey, bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Seven days into the voyage, a propeller bearing had welded itself fast {{due to lack of}} lubrication, leaving the vessel to drift aimlessly for a further ten days without means of steering it or navigating. According to a message Carlin radioed from the tanker to his friends in New York, the couple [...] "drifted and fished", enjoying a [...] "pleasant life, cheaper than Atlantic City". At the time of the couple's rescue, he considered abandoning the entire voyage, but was convinced to continue by the tanker's Norwegian captain, who greeted Carlin with the words: [...] "Hell, you're not going <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> god-damned Jeep lying around?!" ...|$|E
