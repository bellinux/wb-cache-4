2500|$|... where [...] is wheel radius, [...] is {{the bicycle}} head angle {{measured}} from the horizontal, [...] is the motorcycle rake angle measured from the vertical, and [...] is the fork offset. Trail {{can be increased}} by increasing <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>size,</b> decreasing or slackening the head angle, or decreasing the fork offset. Trail decreases as head angle increases (becomes steeper), as fork offset increases, or as wheel diameter decreases.|$|E
2500|$|The {{well-known}} {{dangers of}} the penny-farthing were, for {{the time of its}} prominence, outweighed by its strengths. [...] While it was a difficult, dangerous machine, it was simpler, lighter, and faster than the safer velocipedes of the time. [...] Two new developments changed this situation, and led to the rise of the safety bicycle. [...] The first was the chain drive, originally used on tricycles, allowing a gear ratio to be chosen independent of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>size.</b> [...] The second was the pneumatic bicycle tire, allowing smaller wheels to provide a smooth ride.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Wheel</b> of Manchester was a {{transportable}} Ferris wheel installation at Piccadilly Gardens, Manchester, England. <b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> {{was originally}} a smaller installation based in Exchange Square, first assembled in 2004. <b>The</b> <b>wheel's</b> <b>size</b> was increased to 60 m in 2007, and plans existed to increase this further. However, these plans were never submitted. <b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> was dismantled in 2012 {{to make way}} for 2012 Olympics celebrations and Metrolink construction work. In 2013, a new 52.7 m wheel was installed in Piccadilly Gardens.|$|R
5000|$|In cross-country, {{more than}} other areas of {{mountain}} biking, a debate has begun over <b>the</b> optimal <b>wheel</b> <b>size.</b> <b>The</b> 26-inch <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> that was settled on with {{the inception of the}} current age of mountain biking has all but died off at the top level of cross-country racing as 27.5 and 29 inch wheels are much more popular now. 650b wheels are 584 mm diameter wheels, and approximately 27.5" [...] with a mounted tire. 29" [...] wheels are basically wider equivalents of the road-going 700c format, being 29" [...] with mounted tires.|$|R
50|$|The frame {{lost the}} steel engine cradles, {{but also its}} bolt-on {{subframe}} and the rear ride height adjuster. The swingarm was a new unbraced, rectangular-section extruded design. <b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sizes</b> were <b>the</b> same, but <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> were a new, lighter design. The brake calipers carried over, but the discs were smaller and lighter without stopping power being affected. The rear shock absorber changed from a remote-reservoir to a lighter, more compact piggyback design. The wheelbase dropped 30 mm to 1410 mm.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> for a {{motor vehicle}} or similar wheel {{has a number of}} parameters.|$|E
50|$|No {{tools are}} needed to install Rubbee, and one Rubbee drive can be shared between two or more {{bicycles}}. The drive will fit bicycles with <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> of 16-29 inches and tire width of 20-60 mm.|$|E
50|$|An underbone cycle may share its {{fuel tank}} {{position}} and tube framing, along with fitted bodywork and splash guards with a scooter while <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>size,</b> engine position, and power transmission are {{like those of}} conventional motorcycles.|$|E
5000|$|This {{discrepancy}} {{is chosen}} to give <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sizes</b> a coprime nature; {{the end result}} is that <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> only align <b>the</b> same way once every 26&times;25&times;23&times;21&times;19&times;17 = 101,405,850 enciphered letters (also known as the period). Each key wheel is associated with a slanted metal guide arm that is activated by any pins in the [...] "effective" [...] position. The positions of the pins on each key <b>wheel</b> comprise <b>the</b> first part of the internal keying mechanism of the M-209.|$|R
2500|$|The name [...] "Chevette Sprint" [...] was {{considered}} before calling the Colombia model (first generation) the [...] "Chevrolet Sprint"—to {{distinguish it from}} the Opel knock down kits imported to Brazil. When presented on 7 October 1986, the Sprint caused a sensation. Slight modifications were made in 1987, including increasing <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sizes</b> from 12" [...] to 13" [...] and the Sprint remained in production virtually unchanged til 2004 – with a total production of 70,848.|$|R
2500|$|Skateboarding {{during the}} 1990s became {{dominated}} by street skateboarding. Most boards are about [...] wide and [...] long. <b>The</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are made of}} an extremely hard polyurethane, with hardness (durometer) approximately 99A. <b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sizes</b> are relatively small so that the boards are lighter, and the wheels' inertia is overcome quicker, thus making tricks more manageable. Board styles have changed dramatically since the 1970s but have remained mostly alike since the mid-1990s. The contemporary shape of the skateboard {{is derived from the}} freestyle boards of the 1980s with a largely symmetrical shape and relatively narrow width. This form had become standard by the mid '90s.|$|R
50|$|The car changed {{very little}} during its ten-year {{production}} run, though <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> did increase slightly to 16 in in 1951. The AC 2-litre was outlived by its engine, which {{continued to be}} offered in other AC models until 1963.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 2016, Michelin {{has become}} the series' {{official}} tyre supplier following Bridgestone's withdrawal from the category. Dorna have also agreed a rule change to the 2016 regulations to increase <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> from 16.5 inches to 17 inches (similar to Moto2 and Moto3).|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> is 7.5-20" [...] {{and each}} wheel {{is held in}} place with ten nuts. Both axles on the bogie are fitted with double wheels as {{standard}} other than on the K-44ST, which made do with single wheels on the non-driven rearmost axle.|$|E
50|$|Skateboarding {{during the}} 1990s became {{dominated}} by street skateboarding. Most boards are about 7+1/4 to 8 in wide and 30 to 32 in long. <b>The</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are made of}} an extremely hard polyurethane, with hardness (durometer) approximately 99A. <b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sizes</b> are relatively small so that the boards are lighter, and the wheels' inertia is overcome quicker, thus making tricks more manageable.

50|$|To avoid {{potentially}} dangerous confusion, Michelin used metric sizes for TRX roadwheels instead of <b>the</b> standard imperial <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> (normally stated in inches).|$|R

5000|$|Increased wheel size, {{to keep an}} {{identical}} geometry stack size, results in reduced suspension travel. Each millimeter added to <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> needs to be deducted from the travel. Many 29er bike producers try to minimize this effect by increasing stack size. The same approach would allow 26ers to have even more travel.|$|E
50|$|May 9, 1982 is {{when the}} fourth {{generation}} model appeared (KR), also introducing the non-commercial Sambar Try (KT). The suspension was upgraded to a four-wheel independent layout with MacPherson struts for the front wheels. <b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> increased from 10 inches to 12 inches, thereby accommodating larger drum brakes used at all four wheels. The 4WD was available with a dual-range transmission.|$|E
5000|$|Trail is a {{function}} of head angle, fork offset or rake, and wheel size. Their relationship can be described by this formula:where [...] is wheel radius, [...] is the head angle measured clock-wise from the horizontal and [...] is the fork offset or rake. Trail can be increased by increasing <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>size,</b> decreasing the head angle, or decreasing the fork rake.|$|E
50|$|Component {{selection}} on the Mk 2 sometimes seemed illogical, {{with lower}} level Capreo components on the top-of-the-line monocoque frame, and higher quality SRAM X7 components on the less expensive model. However, the Capreo groupset was {{specifically designed for}} small-wheel bicycles as its smallest 9-tooth sprocket compensates for <b>the</b> small <b>wheel</b> <b>size.</b>|$|R
40|$|A loose {{abrasive}} lapping {{technology was}} developed for truing and dressing ultrafine diamond cup wheels for grinding spherical end faces of fibre optic connectors. The relative densities of exposed grits and grit pull-outs measured from wheel surfaces prepared using the loose abrasive lapping and the bonded abrasive dressing were compared. It {{was found that the}} lapping method with loose abrasives produced wheel surfaces with more exposed grits and less grit pull-outs, especially for finer grit <b>size</b> <b>wheels.</b> For dressing ultrafine grit <b>size</b> <b>wheels,</b> <b>the</b> particle <b>size</b> of the lapping paste should be smaller than <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> grit <b>size</b> to achieve a better result. It is also found that <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> dressed using <b>the</b> lapping method demonstrate an excellent grinding performance. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V [...] All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|... 24-inch {{clincher}} tires (with inner tubes) are <b>the</b> {{most common}} <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> for junior mountain bikes. The typical 24-inch rim has {{a diameter of}} 507 mm (20.0") and an outside tire diameter of about 24" [...] (about 610 mm).|$|R
5000|$|Virtually all trials bikes {{in current}} {{production}} have one gear. The gear ratio chosen by most riders {{results in the}} bike moving approximately the same distance per turn of the pedals regardless of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>size.</b> The most popular gear ratios are given below and most riders will choose a rear cog size within 1 tooth of those given below: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{front axle}} is rigid type, with forged beam and {{drop in the}} middle. The king pins are with slide bearing bushings. The axles were {{produced}} by Kirkstall. The suspension consists of 2½" [...] wide and 1 200 mm long half-elliptic leaf springs, with additional auxiliary springs on the rear axle, and telescopic hydraulic double-acting shock absorbers. <b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> is 7.50 - 16".|$|E

Trail decreases as head angle increases (becomes steeper), as fork offset increases, or as wheel diameter decreases.|$|E
5000|$|Then, {{mountain}} biking changed. <b>The</b> leftover, unquestioned <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> of 1930’s Schwinn Motorbike frames underwent scrutiny - {{was there something}} better, could {{mountain biking}} be improved further still through something more monumental than the creation and improvement of durable, high-end componentry? ...|$|R
5000|$|The forged {{front axle}} beam is I-profile shape {{and there is}} a drop in the middle. The axles are {{produced}} by Kirkstall. Suspension is carried out by leaf springs 1200 mm long and 2.5 in wide. Both front and rear axle are equipped with telescopic shock absorbers. <b>The</b> standard <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> is 7.50 - 16" [...] and 5.50 - 20" [...] was available as an option.|$|R
5000|$|... 26-inch {{clincher}} tires (with inner tubes) are <b>the</b> {{most common}} <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> for mountain bikes. This tradition was started initially because the early mountain bike pioneers procured <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> for their early bikes from American-made bicycles {{rather than the}} larger European standards in use. The typical 26-inch rim has a diameter of 559 mm (22.0") and an outside tire diameter of about 26.2 in.|$|R
5000|$|Yhteissisu {{presented}} in May 1946 a model {{which was more}} suitable to the civil market. Sisu S-22K had its premier in Domestic Industry Fair in Helsinki. The letter K came from kevyt, [...] "light"; the total weight was just 7 tonnes instead of eight tonnes, the front bumper was substituted by a lighter one, <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> was smaller and the army standard towing bracket was left off.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the region, Toyo, Kumho, or Hankook {{tires are}} specified. For National competition, the Toyo RA-1 (205/50R15) is the spec tire. Toyo RA-1 is now {{required}} in SCCA as of January 1, 2010 though the R-888 {{may be used}} until supplies are exhausted. In 2012 Hoosier Tires will provide the spec tire for all National Events. <b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> is fixed at 15x7, with the wheels weighing no less than 13 pounds.|$|E
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} was altered early on with geometry changes and {{removal of the}} rear anti-roll bar to reduce a tendency for lift-off oversteer. For the 1984 facelift, <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> went from 6x15-inch with 205/60-15 tyres to 8x15-inch wheels with 215/50-15 tyres. At {{the same time the}} suspension was lowered 20 mm with slightly stiffer springs for improved handling. For 1987, the Torsen centre differential was used for the first time, replacing the manual centre differential lock.|$|E
5000|$|Skateboarders usually set {{up their}} boards with 48mm to 55mm wheels and {{narrower}} decks to make the board flip and spin faster and to make performing tricks easier. Most boards are about 7+1/4 to 8+3/4 in wide and 30 to 32.5 in long. <b>The</b> <b>wheels</b> are made of an extremely hard polyurethane, with hardness (durometer) anywhere from 80A to 99A. Some wheels will be made harder than measurable on the [...] "A" [...] scale and will have durometers of up to 84B (about 104A). <b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sizes</b> are relatively small so that the boards are lighter, and <b>the</b> <b>wheel's</b> inertia is overcome quicker, thus making tricks more manageable. Board styles have changed dramatically since the 1970s but have remained mostly alike since the mid-1990s. The contemporary shape of the skateboard {{is derived from the}} freestyle boards of the 1980s with a largely symmetrical shape and relatively narrow width. This form had become standard by the mid 1990s. [...] Parts can be individually replaced and fixed should they require maintenance.|$|R
50|$|Other touring bikes use 26-inch wheels {{for both}} {{off-road}} and on-road use. Advantages of <b>the</b> slightly smaller <b>wheel</b> include additional strength, worldwide tire availability, and lighter weight. Some touring bicycles, {{such as the}} Rivendell Atlantis and Surly Long Haul Trucker, offer frames designed for 26-inch (ISO 559) wheels or for 700C <b>wheels,</b> with <b>the</b> frame geometry optimal for <b>the</b> selected <b>wheel</b> <b>size.</b> Specially made touring tires for 26-inch wheels are now widely available, especially in developing countries, where 700C {{may be difficult to}} obtain. Hence, on the mass ride from Paris to the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the Fédération Française de Cyclotourisme asked all riders to use 26-inch wheels.Factors that affect rolling resistance include tire air pressure, tread and tire width as well as <b>wheel</b> <b>size.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For {{bicycles}} with 700c wheels, some cyclists quote gear inches {{based on}} a nominal wheel diameter of 27 inches, corresponding to the old British tire size of 27 x 1¼" [...] (ETRTO 630). Strictly speaking, the rolling diameter of a 700c wheel may be significantly higher or lower than 27", depending on the tire size, e.g. nearly 27.5" [...] for a 700x38 tire, or just over 26" [...] for a 700x20 tire. This can {{be the source of}} some confusion when comparing gears unless it is clear whether gear inches have been calculated using <b>the</b> actual <b>wheel</b> <b>size</b> or a conventionalised 27".|$|R
