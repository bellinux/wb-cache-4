40|$|The {{properties}} of chemoreceptor and baroreceptor neurones in the petrosal ganglion {{of the cat}} were examined in vitro with intracellular micro-electrodes. Chemoreceptor neurones with myelinated axons (average conduction velocity, 11 m/s) showed action potentials with a hump on the falling phase, followed by a prolonged after-hyperpolarization (average duration, 260 ms). The duration of the hump present in the action potential of chemoreceptor neurones {{was positively correlated with}} the duration of the after-hyperpolarization. In response to prolonged depolarization, chemoreceptor neurones showed only one or a few action potentials {{at the beginning of the}} depolarization. Two types of baroreceptors neurones with myelinated axons were found: fast (F) baroreceptors (average conduction velocity, 33 m/s) and slow (S) baroreceptors (average conduction velocity, 10 m/s). F baroreceptors had action potentials without a hump followed by a short after-hyperpolarization (average duration, 43 ms), while S baroreceptors had spikes similar to those found in chemoreceptors except for a shorter hyperpolarization (average duration, 145 ms). Both types of baroreceptor neurones fired repetitively throughout prolonged depolarization.

Traffic from multiple user <b>terminals</b> <b>shares</b> a common pool of capacity by using multi-frequency TDMA.

Traffic requirements above the CIR are met by using a sophisticated bandwidth management algorithm on a dynamic basis. Periodically, each terminal reports its bandwidth requirements to a central controller. The central controller processes the requests that it receives from different user terminals and allocates bandwidth on a fair basis based on the PVC parameters of each connection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} perfect {{secret key}} generation for a “pairwise independent network ” {{model in which}} every pair of <b>terminals</b> <b>share</b> a random binary string, with the strings <b>shared</b> by distinct <b>terminal</b> pairs being mutually independent. The terminals are then allowed to communicate interactively over a public noiseless channel of unlimited capacity. All the terminals {{as well as an}} eavesdropper observe this communication. The objective is to generate a perfect secret key shared by a given set of terminals at the largest rate possible, and concealed from the eavesdropper. First, we show how the notion of perfect omniscience plays a central role in characterizing perfect secret key capacity. Second, a multigraph representation of the underlying secrecy model leads us to an efficient algorithm for perfect secret key generation based on maximal Steiner tree packing. This algorithm attains capacity when all the <b>terminals</b> seek to <b>share</b> a key, and, in general, attains at least half the capacity. Third, when a single “helper ” terminal assists the remaining “user ” terminals in generating a perfect secret key, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the algorithm; also, a “weak” helper is shown to be sufficient for optimality.

30|$|In [20], {{the number}} of {{competing}} terminals is estimated using the extended Kalman filter approach. This approach shows both high accuracy as well as prompt reactivity {{to changes in the}} network occupancy status. Thus the estimated knowledge of traffic load and number of <b>terminals</b> <b>sharing</b> an 802.11 WLAN might effectively drive the load-balancing and handoff algorithms to achieve better network resource utilization. From these estimated values, we calculate the throughput and delay jitter. Provided that the throughput and delay jitter are satisfied based on a prespecified threshold value (e.g., maximum delay variation of 130 milliseconds), then the WLAN will be selected as the active network. Otherwise, the CDMA network is selected. As Figure 4 indicates, the proposed method allows the reservation of the CDMA resources, and therefore the channel capacity will increase. Generally, voice can tolerate a maximum delay variation of 130 milliseconds while preserving good real-time interactivity [21].|$|R
