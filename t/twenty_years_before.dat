5|$|Black tells Bletcher about Richard Alan Hance (Jeremy Roberts), {{a serial}} killer Black had helped to {{apprehend}} <b>twenty</b> <b>years</b> <b>before.</b> Hance was a disturbed Vietnam War veteran who marked his kills with half a playing card, a custom he picked up during his tours of duty. Black {{was one of a}} number of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents who responded to an anonymous tip, leading them to Hance's location — however, the tip was called in by Hance himself and the raid became an ambush. Three agents were killed, and Black was cornered by Hance, who cut open his palm and nearly took Black's life before the young Black was able to overpower and arrest him.|$|E
5|$|Upon leaving NASA in 1985, Lunney took a {{position}} at Rockwell International, the contractor responsible for the construction, operation and maintenance of the space shuttle. At first he worked in California, managing a Rockwell division that was building satellites for the Global Positioning System; this was his first experience with unmanned spacecraft. In 1990, he returned to Houston as President of the Rockwell Space Operations Company, which provided support for flight operations at Johnson Space Center and employed about 3000 people. For Lunney, this represented a return to his roots in mission operations, which he had left <b>twenty</b> <b>years</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E

5|$|Charles Edward Evans {{purchased}} Nailsea Court in 1906. He {{then started}} a restoration programme which took seven years. He employed Arthur James Stratton, {{an expert on}} Tudor architecture to reconstruct the west wing. The restoration included the use of materials from Over Langford Manor. The panelling was installed in his new withdrawing room. Consequently this room was called the Langford Parlour but {{is now known as}} the Langford Room. The Latch porch from Langford was at Nailsea Court for nearly <b>twenty</b> <b>years,</b> <b>before</b> being returned by Charles Evans to Upper Langford in 1923. The rebuilding included the erection of a tower. The first version looked similar to a lighthouse and was changed to one of Tudor appearance which was incorporated into the south wing. During World War I, in an effort to conserve coal, brick insets were built into the fireplaces to reduce their size.|$|E
5|$|As they {{continue}} taking missions, the three {{learn that the}} city's ruling Cardinals are directly responsible for the crisis. Over <b>twenty</b> <b>years</b> <b>before,</b> Prelate Frieda envisioned a world where people were free of Zenith's control. While she was popular among the Cardinals, with her closest ally being Cardinal Rowen, her ideals led to her being killed by extremists. Rowen was thrown into despair by her death, and when shown the truth about Zenith by Cardinal Sullivan, he is convinced {{to work with the}} other Cardinals to fulfill Frieda's vision. Rowen and Sullivan create test subjects programmed to die at specific times: Leanne was #20, designed to die on her 20th birthday. A sympathetic scientist named Juris freed Leanne, and when she learned the truth, she tried to commit suicide before being saved by Zephyr. At the same time, Sullivan studied Rebecca, who had developed natural immunity to the poisons beyond Basel's borders, and sought a way of imprinting her powers onto others. Zephyr was one of his test subjects, along with Zephyr's sister, who was killed by Zephyr during his rampage.|$|E
5|$|The club {{finished}} as runners-up for {{six consecutive}} seasons between 1922 and 1927, before finally winning the League championship in the 1929–30 season, and promotion to the Second Division {{for the first}} time.

They finished fourth in the Second Division and reached the fifth round of the FA Cup. The club were relegated again in 1956 before winning another League title in the 1958–59 season, in the re-unified Third Division. Argyle's stay in the second tier of English football this time lasted almost a decade until they were relegated again in 1968. The club were promoted from the Third Division once more in 1975 as runners-up, {{the first time they}} had done so without ending the season as champions. Argyle reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup {{for the first time in}} April 1984, and were promoted from the Third Division as runners-up again in the 1985–86 season.|$|E
