5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s Davis hired Ralph Munroe to oversee his Key Biscayne property. Munroe had begun visiting Biscayne Bay in 1877. He soon built a home, the Barnacle, on {{land on the}} {{mainland}} in Coconut Grove that he bought from John Frow, keeper of the Cape Florida Light and Fowey Rocks Light. Munroe engaged in wrecking in the waters around Key Biscayne, built sailboats, worked as a pilot for the Cape Florida Channel and opened a pineapple cannery, to which Davis sent his pineapples. Before mail service to the Miami area improved, Munroe would camp out on Key Biscayne every <b>Tuesday</b> <b>evening</b> {{so that he could}} sail out {{to the edge of the}} Gulf Stream early Wednesday morning to retrieve a package of newspapers and magazines dropped for him in waterproof pouches by a passing steamship. Munroe was also one of the founding members of the Biscayne Bay Yacht Club.|$|E

50|$|The {{documents}} of 1765 throw {{light on a}} dispute of a weekly market or fair in Yanam. A weekly market used to be held here on every <b>Tuesday</b> (<b>Even</b> now market occurs in Yanam on this Tuesday only). People used to come to it for purchasing all their essential commodities once for a week. Neelapalli (Nélapilly), a neighbouring village of Yanam was under the British at that time. It is nearly 3 kilometre away from Yanam. The people in this village also used to hold a fair on Tuesday. Thus there was a clash of interests between Yanam and Neelapalli. After prolonged correspondence with the English authorities at Madras, the French authorities in Yanam succeeded in changing the fair of Neelapalli to another day of the week, Saturday. In this way, Yanam triumphed over its neighbouring village Neelapalli.|$|R
25|$|According to Jewish tradition, the Sun {{was created}} {{on the fourth}} day (יום רביעי, yom revi'i) of the week of Creation. Because Jewish law {{considers}} the time unit of a day to span from evening to evening, the beginning of the halachic fourth day, so to speak, is on <b>Tuesday</b> <b>evening</b> at sundown. The 28-year cycle therefore begins and ends at the point in time when the Sun was created, this being sundown on Tuesday. The Sun only returns to this exact position at sundown on a Tuesday once every 28 years.|$|E

The traditional Cliques, which march while playing piccolos and Basler snare drums, retreat to the side streets. The Guggemusik groups march through the city centre, then stop and play four to five songs and then move on. Some Guggemusik groups are also invited to play in cafés and restaurants to serenade the guests.|$|E

25|$|Production on an SNL episode will {{normally}} {{start on}} a Monday with a free-form pitch {{meeting between the}} cast, writers, producers including Michaels, and the guest host, in Michaels' office, over two hours.

At this point there may be at least 40 sketch ideas which are read-through in turn, lasting upwards of three hours.|$|E
25|$|Membership has {{varied from}} the {{original}} nine banjo players to well over a hundred. It includes both banjo and gut bucket (washtub bass) players plus a Band Auxiliary. From its humble beginnings {{in the basement of}} the Cupertino Music Store, the PBB did not have an official public venue until 1966. Having outgrown the music store, a gentleman by the name of Ward Pinther offered to host the band at his Straw Hat Pizza Palace in Campbell, California. This hospitality lasted for the next 24 years until Pinther's retirement and the closing of the restaurant. Not to be deterred, the band moved to yet another Straw Hat Pizza restaurant in the nearby San Jose neighborhood of Willow Glen. So from 1966 until Tuesday, June 16, 2009, the band entertained crowds every <b>Tuesday</b> <b>evening</b> at a Straw Hat Pizza restaurant. During the band's heyday in the 1970s and 1980s, it was not unusual to have four rows of twenty to twenty five banjo players performing plus as many as eight gutbucket players and a tuba. The sound produced by a hundred or more banjos is unique and unlike anything else in the world of acoustic performances.|$|E

25|$|In 1887 Burnett {{traveled}} to England for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, {{which became the}} first of yearly transatlantic trips from the United States to England. Accompanied by her sons, she visited tourist attractions such as Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum in London. In her rented rooms she continued the <b>Tuesday</b> <b>evening</b> salon and soon attracted visitors, meeting Stephen Townsend for the first time. Despite her busy schedule, she felt ill {{from the heat and}} the crowds of tourists, spending protracted periods in bed. With her sons, she moved on to spend the winter in Florence, where she wrote The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax, the only book to be published in England but not in the United States. That winter Sara Crewe or What Happened at Miss Minchin's was published in the United States. She would go on to make Sara Crewe into a stage play, and later rewrite the story into ALittle Princess. In 1888, Burnett returned to Manchester, where she leased a large home off Cromwell Road, had it decorated, and then turned it over to cousins to run as a boarding house, after which she moved to London, where she again took rooms, enjoyed the London season, and prepared Phyllis for production, a stage adaptation of The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax. When the play ran she was disappointed by the bad reviews, and turned to socializing. During this period she began to see more of Stephen Townsend, whom she had met during the Jubilee year.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan's batsmen {{struggled}} again, Hanif being {{dismissed by}} Trueman off {{only the second}} ball of the innings, and they were 127 for six at the close on Saturday. Only Mushtaq and Saeed could offer any resistance. Nasim made 41 on Monday morning and almost saved the follow-on {{but they were all}} out for 219, 209 behind. In the second innings, Hanif was again dismissed quickly and Pakistan were 11 for one at close of play on Monday. As the final day got under way, another collapse looked inevitable until Mushtaq and Saeed held England at bay with a stand of 107 for the fourth wicket. With 65 minuttes to go on <b>Tuesday</b> <b>evening,</b> Pakistan with five wickets left needed 22 runs more to avoid the innings defeat, Mushtaq and Shahid batting. There was then a dramatic over bowled by Trueman which could have won the game for England. First, Mushtaq was missed by substitute fielder Cyril Poole at long leg and then Shahid, who had not scored, was dropped by Titmus at slip. Pakistan batted on and Mushtaq completed a deserved century just before the close, scoring exactly 100 not out. It was his second Test century and he became the first player in Test history to achieve a second century before the age of 20. Pakistan ended on 216 for six, a lead of just seven runs, and the match was drawn.|$|E
