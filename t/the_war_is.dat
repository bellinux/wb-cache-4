By late 1944, most Einsatzgruppen personnel had been folded into Waffen-SS combat units or transferred to permanent death camps. Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the Einsatzgruppen and related agencies killed {{more than two million}} people, including 1.3 million Jews.

The conflict between pacifistic interpretations of Ahimsa and the theories of just war prescribed by the Gita has been resolved by some scholars such as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, as being an allegory, wherein the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> within each human being, where man's higher impulses struggle against his own evil impulses.|$|E

5|$|Egypt's {{commitment}} to <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> {{considered to have}} been detrimental to its performance in the Six-Day War of June 1967, after which Nasser found {{it increasingly difficult to}} maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen. The surprising removal of Sallal on November 5 by Yemeni dissidents, supported by republican tribesmen, resulted in an internal shift of power in the capital, while the royalists approached it from the north. The new republic government was headed by Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman, all of which shortly either resigned or fled the country, leaving the disarrayed capital under the control of Prime Minister Hassan Amri. The 1967 siege of Sana'a became the turning point of the war. The remaining republican Prime Minister succeeded in keeping control of Sana'a and by February 1968, the royalists lifted the siege. Clashes continued in parallel with peace talks until 1970, when Saudi Arabia recognized the Republic, and a ceasefire came into effect.|$|E
5|$|Forrest {{is often}} bullied {{because of his}} {{physical}} disability and marginal intelligence. One day, while trying to escape some bullies chasing him, his braces fall off revealing the young Forrest {{to be a very}} fast runner. Despite his low intelligence quotient, Forrest's new running ability leads to him receiving a football scholarship to the University of Alabama in the early 1960s, becoming a top running back, being named on the All-American team, and meeting President John F. Kennedy. After his college graduation, he enlists in the US Army, where he befriends a fellow soldier named Bubba, who convinces Forrest to go into the shrimping business with him when <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> over. In 1967, they are sent to Vietnam and, during an ambush, Bubba is killed in action. Forrest saves many of his platoon, including his Lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both his legs. Forrest is awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism.|$|E
5000|$|Craven was {{a leader}} of the [...] "revisionist" [...] historians in the 1930s who said <b>the</b> Civil <b>War</b> <b>was</b> caused by a failure of democracy. He {{rejected}} the [...] "progressive" [...] school of Charles A. Beard, who argued <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> an inevitable conflict between the agrarian South and the industrial North. Craven increasingly took a pro-Southern and even pro-slavery position on the causes of <b>the</b> Civil <b>War.</b> His explanation of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> basically psychological, arguing according to John David Smith that, [...] "Fear, suspicion, passion, propaganda, distortion" [...] caused <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Craven especially emphasized exaggerated abolitionist attacks on slavery. <b>The</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> avoidable, he argued, but selfish politicians escalated the psychological fears to their own advantage.|$|R

5|$|Miyazaki's biggest {{addition}} to {{the plot of the}} book was the use of the war as {{a large part of the}} plot. In the book, <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> only tangentially referred to; the king orders Howl to find the king's missing brother Justin, because Justin's military skills are needed for a forthcoming war. Howl's frequent disappearances are because of his womanizing habits, which makes Sophie see him as a superficial and cowardly person. In the film, however, Howl disappears from the scene in order to transform into a giant bird and disrupt the battle plans of both armies.|$|E

5|$|Pontiac's War (also {{known as}} Pontiac's Conspiracy or Pontiac's Rebellion) was {{launched}} in 1763 by a loose confederation of elements of Native American tribes, primarily from the Great Lakes region, the Illinois Country, and Ohio Country who were dissatisfied with British postwar policies in the Great Lakes region after the British victory in the French and Indian War (1754–1763). Warriors from numerous tribes joined the uprising {{in an effort to}} drive British soldiers and settlers out of the region. <b>The</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> named after the Odawa leader Pontiac, the most prominent of many native leaders in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Some sources conflate Operation Hurricane-91 and {{elements}} of Operation Papuk-91, presenting the latter {{as a part}} of Operation Hurricane-91, specifically including the December 1991 advance of the 123rd Infantry Brigade made on the northeastern slopes of the Psunj mountain. Operation Hurricane-91 is commemorated annually {{at the site of the}} Trokut Motel north of Novska, where a monument listing names of 314 Croatian troops killed in defence of Novska throughout <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> located. Operations Swath-10, Papuk-91, and Hurricane-91, executed in Western Slavonia in late 1991, are considered to be the first Croatian offensive operations of liberation in the Croatian War of Independence.|$|E
5|$|Somewhere {{around the}} time of the failed {{offensive}} against Moscow in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately. Plans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe—eleven million people—were formalised at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942. Some would be worked to death and the rest would be killed in the implementation of Die Endlösung der Judenfrage (the Final Solution of the Jewish question). Initially the victims were killed with gas vans or by Einsatzgruppen firing squads, but these methods proved impracticable for an operation of this scale. By 1941, killing centres at Auschwitz concentration camp, Sobibor, Treblinka and other Nazi extermination camps replaced Einsatzgruppen as the primary method of mass killing. The total number of Jews murdered during <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> estimated at 5.5 to six million people, including over a million children. Twelve million people were put into forced labour.|$|E

The territory's most important contribution to <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> commonly held to be its contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), under which 8,235 British, Commonwealth and Allied airmen were trained in Southern Rhodesian flight schools. The colony's operational casualties numbered 916 killed and 483 wounded of all races.|$|E
5|$|The {{precepts of}} Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with sincere and truthful dialogue. Force {{must be the}} last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its {{objective}} to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful. War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction. All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment. Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.|$|E
5|$|The war, lasting {{less than}} three {{quarters}} of an hour, is considered the shortest in recorded history. Several durations are given by sources, including 38, 40 and 45 minutes, but the 38-minute duration is the most often quoted. The variation is due to confusion over what actually constitutes the start and end of a war. Some sources take {{the start of the}} war as the order to open fire at 09:00 and some with the start of actual firing at 09:02. The end of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> usually put at 09:40, when the last shots were fired and the palace flag struck, but some sources place it at 09:45. The logbooks of the British ships also suffer from this with St George indicating that cease-fire was called and Khalid entered the German consulate at 09:35, Thrush at 09:40, Racoon at 09:41, and Philomel and Sparrow at 09:45.|$|E

Photographs of this meeting are on display in the carriage. Mannerheim was a regular diner at the Mikkelin Klubi, where his favourite drink was schnapps.|$|E
5|$|The 12th Battalion is {{unexpectedly}} attacked {{soon after}} by Intelligent Defense Systems, a private military contractor that had secretly supported first the Lazurians, then the NRA by supplying them with {{weapons of mass}} destruction. Dr. Caulder, leader of the IDS, had taken advantage of the world's devastation to carry out horrific biological and psychological experiments that he would have been unable to undertake otherwise, such as creating and spreading a terrible new disease called the Creeper, which causes flowers to bloom from infected individuals, {{for the sole purpose of}} studying the survivor's reactions. Despite numerous demoralizing attacks by IDS and its massive bomber, the Great Owl, the battalion survives and infiltrates and brings down The Great Owl, eventually pursuing Caulder to his main laboratory and fortress, The Nest. In the end, Caulder is killed in the destruction of his lab, and <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> finally brought to an end.
