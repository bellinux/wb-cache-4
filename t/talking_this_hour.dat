40|$|Transcription begins] Class 42 – J. Aviation Cadet Section Army Basic Flying School Greenville, Miss. July 31, 1942 Bryant College Service Club, I don’t {{know exactly}} at whom I should direct my {{thanks for the}} very {{thoughtful}} gift I received the other day, so I’ll just say thanks a million. My roommates, with whom I shared my package, now wish {{they had gone to}} Bryant. I sure was glad to receive a copy of “On the Campus. ” And that Greek Letter Dance [...] boy, wouldn’t I like to take that in? But I guess I’ll have to wait until we beat the beans out of these “slant-eyes. ” Right now I’d like [to] add the B. C. S. C. onto my list. (I’m going to bring down a “Zero” for every name on my list [...] so help me!) I’d like to <b>talk</b> like <b>this</b> for <b>hours,</b> but it will be “taps” in about 15 minutes. I’d like to hear more of the “goings on” at Bryant. Sincerely, Mike Lada [Transcription ends...|$|R

2500|$|The Fathers of the Church dwell {{constantly}} on the symbolism of <b>this</b> <b>hour.</b> Noon is the hour {{when the sun is}} at its full, it is the image of Divine splendour, the plenitude of God, the time of grace; at the sixth hour Abraham received the three angels. We should pray at noon, says St. Ambrose, because that is the time when the Divine light is in its fulness. Origen, St. Augustine, and several others regard <b>this</b> <b>hour</b> as favourable to prayer. Lastly and above all, it was the hour when Christ was nailed to the Cross; this memory excelling all the others left a still visible trace in most of the liturgy of <b>this</b> <b>hour.</b> <b>This</b> scene from Good Friday is the background for Sext. [...] "Lead us not into temptation" [...] is the message of <b>this</b> <b>hour.</b> It is also a time to ask God to grant one health and peace of heart, as in the traditional hymn Rector Potens.|$|R
