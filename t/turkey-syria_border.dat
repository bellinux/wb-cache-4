After the RF-4 downing in June 2012 Turkey changed its rules of engagements against Syrian aircraft, resulting in scrambles and downings of Syrian combat aircraft. On 16 September 2013, a Turkish Air Force F-16 shot down a Syrian Arab Air Force Mil Mi-17 helicopter in Latakia province near Turkish boder. On 23 March 2014, a Turkish Air Force F-16 shot down a Syrian Arab Air Force Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 when it allegedly entered Turkish air space during a ground attack mission against Al Qaeda-linked insurgents.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 400 ISIL fighters had also been wounded in the previous five days in clashes with the Syrian Army and National Defense Force in Raqqa alone. At the same time, several senior UK and US figures urged Turkey to stop allowing ISIL to cross the border to Syria and Iraq.

50|$|On 3 September, Turkey {{additionally}} deployed {{tanks to}} the Syrian town of al-Rai {{to help the}} Turkish-backed rebels to push east from the town towards villages captured by the rebels west of Jarabulus. The incursion was launched from Kilis province which had been frequently targeted with rocket attacks from ISIL. The Sham Legion and the Hamza Division also announced they had captured four villages (Fursan, Lilawa, Kino and Najma) south of Arab Ezza. The United States stated that it had hit ISIL targets near the <b>Turkey-Syria</b> <b>border</b> via the newly deployed HIMARS system. The Turkish armed forces meanwhile reported that the rebels had captured two villages and an airport near al-Rai. An official of the Fastaqim Kama Umirt also stated that the rebels had captured eight villages {{to the east and}} south of the town. SOHR confirmed that the Turkish-backed rebels had captured three villages near the Sajur river with advances in two other villages. It also confirmed that the rebels had captured a village near al-Rai. The U.S. Embassy in Ankara said US forces hit ISIL targets overnight near Turkey's border with Syria using HIMARS located in Turkey.|$|E
5000|$|On 9 April, Swedish {{police said}} Akilov had [...] "expressed sympathy for extremist organizations, among them IS State". On 14 April, Uzbek Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov said that Akilov had joined ISIS {{after moving to}} Sweden, and had {{encouraged}} friends and family in Uzbekistan to fight for ISIS. Uzbekistan had opened an investigation and charged Akilov with participation in extremist, separatist and fundamentalist groups, {{as well as with}} making and distributing material that threatened public security. An Uzbek security source said Akilov had tried to travel to Syria in 2015 to join ISIL but was stopped at the <b>Turkey-Syria</b> <b>border</b> and sent back to Sweden. The source added that, two months before the attack, Uzbek authorities had put Akilov on a wanted list for those suspected of religious extremism. The Foreign Minister said that intelligence on Akilov had been [...] "passed to one of our Western partners, so that the Swedish side could be informed". The Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs said it had not received such information. ISIS has not claimed responsibility for the attack, but experts note that the group tends not to do so if its members are arrested, as in the Stockholm attack.|$|E
30|$|Our {{quasi-experimental}} design exploits {{the forced}} inflow of refugees from Northern Syria to the Southeastern regions of Turkey. We employ the following difference-in-differences strategy {{to estimate the}} impact of refugee inflows on the labor market outcomes of natives. Massive inflows of Syrian refugees to Turkey have started {{at the beginning of}} 2012. So, the date of treatment is assumed to be January 1, 2012. We set a symmetric window around this date: 2010 – 2011 and 2012 – 2013 are set as pre-immigration and post-immigration periods, respectively. Although {{a tiny fraction of the}} Syrian refugees may have left Southeastern Turkey and moved toward the Northern and Western parts of the country, a very large portion of the refugees have been located in the cities nearby the <b>Turkey-Syria</b> <b>border.</b> Using the official figures published by Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD), we construct a “treatment area” from the cities in the Southeastern part of Turkey, for which the refugee-population ratio is above 2 %. The rest of the cities in the neighboring regions that are hosting only negligible amounts of Syrian refugees form the “control area,” which is similar to the “treatment area” in terms of cultural aspects, socio-demographic characteristics, and the level of economic development. 6 The data set includes only the natives, i.e., we do not observe any details for the refugees. 7 Given the data on natives, our difference-in-differences strategy identifies the impact of Syrian refugees on the labor market outcomes of the natives living in the treatment area, based on a pre- vs post-immigration comparison with the control area.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the geochemical {{features of the}} fluids circulating over the Amik Basin (SE <b>Turkey–Syria</b> <b>border),</b> which is crossed by the Northern extension of theDSF (Dead Sea Fault) and represents the boundary area of three tectonic plates (Anatolian, Arabian and African plates). We collected 34 water samples (thermal and cold from natural springs and boreholes) as well as 8 gas samples (bubbling and gas seepage) besides the gases dissolved in the sampled waters. The {{results show that the}} dissolved gas phase is a mixture of shallow (atmospheric) and deep components either of mantle and crustal origin. Coherently the sampled waters are variable mixtures of shallow and deep ground waters, the latter being characterised by higher salinity and longer residence times. The deep groundwaters (fromboreholes deeper than 1000 m) have a CH 4 -dominated dissolved gas phase related to the presence of hydrocarbon reservoirs. The very unique tectonic setting of the area includes the presence of an ophiolitic block outcropping in the westernmost area on the African Plate, as well as basalts located to the North and East on the Arabic Plate. The diffuse presence of CO 2 -enriched gases, although diluted by the huge groundwater circulation, testifies a regional degassing activity. Fluids circulating over the ophiolitic block are marked by H 2 -dominated gases with abiogenic methane and high-pH waters. The measured 3 He/ 4 He isotopic ratios display contributions from both crustal and mantle-derived sources over both sides of the DSF. Although the serpentinization process is generally independent from mantle-type contribution, the recorded helium isotopic ratios highlight variable contents of mantle-derived fluids. Due to the absence of recent volcanism over the western side of the basin (African Plate), we argue that CO 2 -rich volatiles carrying mantle-type helium and enriched in heavy carbon, are degassed by deep-rooted regional faults rather than from volcanic sources...|$|E
40|$|Highlights • The complex geodynamic {{structure}} of the area {{is reflected in the}} wide range of compositions of the emitted fluids. • High salinity waters with hydrocarbon gases and a purely crustal He component were collected from deep wells. • Hyperalkaline waters with CH 4 - and H 2 -dominated gases are found in the ophiolite complex. • Shallow meteoric groundwaters {{in the southern part of}} the basin show a prevailing atmospheric component for dissolved gases. • A significant mantle component (He and C) is found in the dissolved gases of the northeastern sites.
