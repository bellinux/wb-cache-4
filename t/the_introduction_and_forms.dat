40|$|The {{debate about}} <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>and</b> <b>form</b> of {{abortion}} legislation in Ireland {{is rife with}} floodgate arguments, suggesting (either implicitly or expressly) that <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of abortion legislation within current constitutional boundaries would only be a starting point, following which so-called ‘abortion on demand’ would flow. The recent discussions at the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children showed little prospect of a break from this pattern. At those hearings, a number of parliamentarians asked repeatedly whether <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of limited abortion pursuant to the current constitutional position would result in widely available abortion. Then—as in quite common in Irish abortion discourse—the abortion regime operating under the British Abortion Act 1967 was expressly referred to {{as an example of}} a possible ‘end point’ for Irish abortion law. In this article we address three of the core legally-grounded ‘floodgate’ arguments that are made, outlining how these fears are unfounded, disingenuous, and, more particularly, how comparisons to the British abortion regime are unhelpful, by reference to the constitutional position in Ireland. These arguments relate to: the lack of a time limit on the availability of abortion; suicidal ideation; and the possibility of patient-doctor collusion. This paper aims to show that these arguments have no current legal purchase within the Irish context and ought not to be given undue weight in the debates. Rather, the fears and concerns represented by these floodgate arguments are already managed by the very limited constitutional availability of abortion. They ought not, as a result, to bear in any meaningful way on the current process of legislative design which should instead be committed to introducing a clear, workable and effective legislative framework for women in Ireland to exercise their right to access an abortion where they wish to do so in a manner that reflects the constitutional position...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of school television in Sweden during the 1960 ?s. It focuses partly on formal and institutional attitudes and values, {{as in the}} educational system, and it is partly {{an investigation of the}} actual programmes made. <b>The</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> of school television is seen as a consequence due to many factors. It was the time of a growing welfare society which demanded new skills from socially active and concerned citizens, television was a rather new medium in Sweden and there were ideological disagreements about its purposes and aims, as well as the educational system searched for new and modern methods. The ambivalence towards the combination television and education is central for this study. Television as medium represented both a revealing mirror of the world and pure entertainment built on seductive images. School television is here considered as a part of an ideological conquering of a new medium. Another important part is the research of the actual programmes in the field of society and social issues, aiming at pupils aged 9 - 19. Starting with a discussion about fiction and nonfiction, one conclusion is that fiction forms were used with consideration. The terms formal and open voice as a way of structuring the nonfiction programmes are mainly used. The formal voice is more explicit and expository, depending very much on the 'Voice of God', the open voice is more observational, less explicit, but still taking implicit stands. The roles of the participants are studied - especially children and youths - and also what subjects the programmes actually treated and how they changed during the decade. The belief in the modern society was central, as was the confidence in a reachable better world, {{at the same time as}} new and more critical perspectives were introduced. The image of Sweden and the world outside developed and was modified. The strong theme of similarity, that the life is basically the same all over the world, unified in the modernity, is here interpreted as an assurance that 'they' trying to be like 'us'. Differences remained: violence and death belonged to the 'them'...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{an approach}} for teaching Marketing Principles in an MBA course through service-learning to enable adult learners {{to connect the}} lectures’ marketing content to a real-world marketing project. During the course, 40 students in groups of four to five individuals were involved in eight different client-sponsored marketing projects executed simultaneously. The rationale, planning and management of this approach utilised current research on service-learning, living cases and client-sponsored projects in marketing education. The experimental curriculum design is presented in a timeline that mirrors the preparation {{and management of the}} group projects and the considerations {{to be taken into account}} when initiating and facilitating the projects. Reflections from this iteration of the service-learning design suggest the importance of: detailed project planning, the involvement of students in choosing <b>the</b> projects, <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> feedback loops, the role of the instructor in facilitating the students and managing expectations, and the role of the company representative in supporting the groups...|$|R
40|$|The urbanization-city {{development}} process in American {{history has been}} the focus of numerous scholarly investigations. Economic historians in particular, bringing the perspective and methods of economics to bear, have made significant contributions to this burgeoning literature. In Dimensions in Urban History the Hollingsworths propose a broader, more ambitious undertaking: the application of the wide panopoly of social science concepts and theory to understand better the historical process of urban development. As such this book lays claim to a wide potential readership. The text is divided into a brief <b>introduction</b> <b>and</b> four chapters. <b>The</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>and</b> first chapter <b>form</b> <b>the</b> core of the authors 2 ̆ 7 treatise. In these 56 pages the authors first re- strict their analysis to 2 ̆ 2 middle-sized 2 ̆ 2 cities containing between 10, 000 and 25, 000 in- habitants in 1900 and not exceeding 250, 000 during the entire period since 1870. Second, and more importantly, utilizing concepts from various social sciences they attempt to identify certain 2 ̆ 2 ideal types 2 ̆ 2 that both differentiate middle-sized cities at a point in time and explain their development over time.

The attention is focused on major limitations in the taplemenitation of complete mutual financial aid and of the related rules of cooperative banks as local institutions of small banking credit. The mutual financial aid is limited among others, by the duty on cooperative banks to associate in the State-cooperative owned Bank of the Food Economy as their auditing, organizational and financial central office, this is a channel securing intervention of the State administration in the affairs of credit cooperatives and of the associated individual farmers. Decision-making competence of the centrai Sitate administration in the respect of loaning and other banking «services as well as the directive character of limits and binding guide-lines following from an annual State credit plan are breaking direct links between a credit action and the economic character of local funds of the mutual financial aid. They are also strengthening the effect of administrative measures of directing activities of cooperative banks and weakening cooperative rules and methods of banking influence on individual farmers. Similarly the statutory rules of socializing profits and assimilating cooperative management of earmarked funds to a financial management of state enterprises are decreasing the stimulating role of the mutual financial aid and of the or elated specific cooperative rules. A process of changing statutes of cooperative banks which has begun in 1983 can facilitate <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of rules <b>and</b> <b>forms</b> which were described in the end of the article, they can effectuate more complete than previous financial mutual aid of credit cooperatives.

40|$|Book synopsis: At a {{time like}} the present, in which {{profound}} changes, of varying territorial scope, are investing in our country, it seems appropriate to propose again to a classic food for thought (we might even {{say one of the}} 'primitive') of regional sciences, one related to relationships - not simple, nor discounted - between knowledge, innovation and regional development. It is declined compared to two drivers of change, epochal. The first has its causes in the general transformation of the institutional, administrative <b>and</b> organizational, urging <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> ways of government (and management) and innovative, however, other than those attributable to the simple juxtaposition of various alternative stereotypes (state and market, local and global networks and hierarchies). The second, however, reflects the critical thinking that, from many sides, are advanced in order to the same assumptions that underlie the notions of development, welfare, wealth and sustainability. In addition to the qualitative and intangible dimensions with respect to which these notions are declined, other determinants are becoming more important today in guiding the conduct of socio-economic actors: the fact that a human agent is not just a homo economicus, but a homo socialis, a homo sapiens (an agent whose behavior is guided by a set of knowledge luggage), called to operate within a collective culture system (a global public good, distributed intelligence, a share capital), which in turn produced from acting of individual agents. The basic hypothesis that we advance in this book, in essence, is to admit that the knowledge, whether understood from a substantive point of view - in its implicit components, explicit and relational - or procedural terms - as a set of strategies to reduce the uncertainty that accompanies human action - encouraging the emergence of shared social values, bearers of meaning for all urban actors (individuals and organizations) and able to raise awareness of the individual. Of values, that is, able to facilitate the establishment of innovative community, in view of the complexity of this and the unpredictability of the future. This hypothesis constitutes a challenge for research, {{to the extent that the}} knowledge in question is accompanied by a permanent process of building, testing and consolidation that is not only the prerogative of the scientific world, but it also affects the conditions same action of the different actors involved in a civil society that is increasingly dynamic and articulate...|$|R
