5|$|Newer {{styles of}} play have {{recently}} emerged, pushing {{the bounds of}} what the gandingan was traditionally used for. One <b>type</b> <b>of</b> play called kulndet requires players to perform highly dense, complicated rhythmic patterns upon the gandingan. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> play unlike the olden (kamamatuan) style of gandingan playing requires assistants to hold the gongs to avoid long suspensions of sound. Because of the strenuous <b>type</b> <b>of</b> play, male musicians usually perform this style during contests held at weddings where players would demonstrate their virtuosity, considered a sign of masculinity, on the gandingan. During a gandingan contest, two expert gandingan players (pagagandings) would play a particular piece several times in rotation with each other. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> play {{is said to have}} evolved from the spread of virtousic style on the agung.|$|E
