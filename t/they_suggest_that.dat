5|$|The {{following}} cladograms {{generated by}} Archibald and colleagues show two possible phylogenetic positions of Macabeemyrma among some ants of the subfamily Myrmeciinae; the cladogram {{on the right}} included three additional extinct genera compared to that on the left. <b>They</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Macabeemyrma ovata and other extinct ants such as Avitomyrmex and Ypresiomyrma may be {{closely related to the}} living Nothomyrmecia macrops.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{review of}} the genus Gyromitra, authors van Vooren and Moreau say that Bosc's {{original}} species description is ambiguous, leaving much room for interpretation, and <b>they</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> several reports of the species occurring in Europe should be referred to Gyromitra fastigiata. They point out that in 1970, Estonian mycologist Ain Raitviir considered Bosc's Morchella caroliniana a nomen dubium, and Fries's description as nomen confusum, and advocated the abandonment of the specific epithet caroliniana. In the early 1970s, Kent McKnight redefined the taxon and selected a neotype, based on five specimens collected from Lorton, Virginia in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Some critics, {{among them}} Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have {{wondered}} {{what would have}} happened if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. <b>They</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not write his first wholly distinct work until Balakirev goaded and inspired him to write Romeo. How well Tchaikovsky might have developed in the long run is another matter. He owed much of his musical ability, including his skill at orchestration, to the thorough grounding in counterpoint, harmony and musical theory he received at the Conservatory. Without that grounding, Tchaikovsky might not have been able to write what would become his greatest works.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "present subjunctive" [...] (morphologically {{identical}} with the bare infinitive) is regularly used in AmE in mandative clauses (as in <b>They</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> he {{apply for the}} job). In BrE, this usage declined in the 20th century in favour of constructions such as <b>They</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> he should apply for the job (or even, more ambiguously, <b>They</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> he applied for the job). However, the mandative subjunctive has always been used in BrE, especially in formal writing.|$|R

5|$|Trujillo and Sheppard {{in a paper}} {{announcing the}} {{discovery}} of several more distant objects noted a correlation between the longitude of perihelion and the argument of perihelion of these objects. Those with a longitude of perihelion of 0–120° have arguments of perihelion between 280–360°, and those with longitude of perihelion of 180–340° have argument of perihelion 0–40°. The statistical significance of this correlation was 99.99%. <b>They</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the correlation {{is due to the}} orbits of these objects avoiding close approaches to Planet Nine by passing above or below its orbit. Trujillo and Sheppard also noted that the arguments of perihelion of ETNOs with perihelion less than 35 AU are opposite those with perihelion greater than 35 AU.|$|E
5|$|From 20 January 1943, the Partisans {{had been}} hard-pressed by the Axis Case White offensive. Throughout that offensive, Partisan Supreme Headquarters engaged the Germans in {{negotiations}} to gain time {{to cross the}} Neretva river. In late February or early March 1943, the Partisans captured a German officer and about 25 soldiers, who joined about 100 Croatian Home Guards, and 15 Italian officers and 600 soldiers already being held as prisoners of war by the Partisans. Due to their desperate situation {{at this stage of}} Case White, and their need to delay the Axis in order to cross the Neretva river before the Germans struck, they decided to use the recently captured German officer to initiate negotiations. The German historians Ladislaus Hory and Martin Broszat concluded that at this critical period, Tito was also concerned {{that by the end of}} the war the attrition to his Partisan forces would be such that Mihailović's Chetniks would be more powerful. <b>They</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Tito may have been willing to agree to a truce with the Germans in order to destroy the Chetniks.|$|E
5|$|Many {{writers have}} speculated {{on the ways}} in which a {{friendly}} civilization might interact with humankind. Albert Harrison, a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California, Davis, thought that a highly advanced civilization might teach humanity such things as a physical theory of everything, how to use zero-point energy, or how to travel faster than light. <b>They</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> collaboration with such a civilization could initially be in the arts and humanities before moving to the hard sciences, and even that artists may spearhead collaboration. Seth D. Baum, of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, and others consider that the greater longevity of cooperative civilizations in comparison to uncooperative and aggressive ones might render extraterrestrial civilizations in general more likely to aid humanity. In contrast to these views, however, Paolo Musso, a member of the SETI Permanent Study Group of the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, took the view that extraterrestrial civilizations possess, like humans, a morality driven not entirely by altruism but for individual benefit as well, thus leaving open the possibility that at least some extraterrestrial civilizations are hostile.|$|E
50|$|With his {{colleague}} Josh Lerner, Sahlman argued that several steps {{could be taken}} to make entrepreneurship as competitive in the United States {{as it is in}} China or Brazil. For example, <b>they</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the USG should invest more in business ventures, and use the toolbox of taxes and subsidies to encourage innovation. <b>They</b> also <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the government should let entrepreneurs address social ills, {{as in the case of}} charter schools. They added educated immigrants should be given green cards to improve the rate of human capital in the United States. Moreover, <b>they</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> capital markets should be liberated from unnecessary regulations. <b>They</b> also <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the government should publish financial data and encourage dialogue between trade organizations, and discourage unfair competition by banning monopolies. Additionally, they noted that the government should do away with Obamacare and encourage entrepreneurship in healthcare; lower taxes; find the right balance in protecting intellectual rights to enable innovation; maintain flexible dismissals; and reduce political gridlock.|$|R

5|$|The main {{contemporary}} accounts {{relating to}} Krak des Chevaliers are of Muslim origin {{and tend to}} emphasize Muslim success while overlooking setbacks against the Crusaders although <b>they</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the Knights Hospitaller forced the settlements of Hama and Homs {{to pay tribute to}} the Order. This situation lasted as long as Saladin's successors warred between themselves. The proximity of Krak des Chevaliers to Muslim territories allowed it to take on an offensive role, acting as a base from which neighboring areas could be attacked. By 1203 the garrison were making raids on Montferrand (which was under Muslim control) and Hama, and in 1207 and 1208 the castle's soldiers took part in an attack on Homs. Krak des Chevaliers acted as a base for expeditions to Hama in 1230 and 1233 after the amir refused to pay tribute. The former was unsuccessful, but the 1233 expedition was a show of force that demonstrated the importance of Krak des Chevaliers.|$|E
5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, <b>they</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that,</b> if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E

25|$|Biggeri and Mehrotra {{have studied}} the {{macroeconomic}} factors that encourage child labour. They focus their study on five Asian nations including India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines. <b>They</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> child labour {{is a serious problem}} in all five, {{but it is not a}} new problem. Macroeconomic causes encouraged widespread child labour across the world, over most of human history. <b>They</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the causes for child labour include both the demand and the supply side. While poverty and unavailability of good schools explain the child labour supply side, <b>they</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the growth of low-paying informal economy rather than higher paying formal economy is amongst the causes of the demand side. Other scholars too suggest that inflexible labour market, sise of informal economy, inability of industries to scale up and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major macroeconomic factors affecting demand and acceptability of child labour.|$|E
