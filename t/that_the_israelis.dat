5|$|There was no {{criminal}} inquiry. Palestinian police allowed journalists {{to photograph the}} scene the following day, but they gathered no forensic evidence. According to a Palestinian general, there was no Palestinian investigation {{because there was no}} doubt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> had killed the boy. General Yom Tov Samia of the IDF said the presence of protesters meant the Israelis were unable to examine and take photographs of the scene. The increase in violence at the junction cut off the Nezarim settlers, so the IDF evacuated them and, a week after the shooting, blew up everything within 500 metres of the IDF outpost, thereby destroying the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|At night, a Syrian {{expeditionary force}} {{attempted}} to infiltrate Degania Bet, but was caught and warded off, which caused the main Syrian force to attack Degania Alef first. At 06:00, the Syrians started a frontal armored attack, consisting of 5 tanks, {{a number of}} armored vehicles and an infantry company. The Syrians pierced the Israeli defense, but their infantry was at some distance behind the tanks. The Israelis knocked out four Syrian tanks and four armored cars with 20mm cannons, PIATs and Molotov cocktails. Meanwhile, other defenders kept small arms fire on the Syrian infantry, who stopped in citrus groves a few hundred meters from the settlements. The surviving Syrian tanks withdrew back to the Golan. At 07:45, the Syrians halted their assault and dug in, still holding most of the territory between Degania Alef's fence and Samakh's police fort. They left behind a number of lightly damaged or otherwise inoperable tanks <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> managed to repair.|$|E
5|$|While {{the battle}} was taking place, the 65mm {{artillery}}, four Napoleonchik canons, reached the front {{in the middle of}} the day and were placed on the Poria–Alumot ridge. It was the first Israeli artillery to be used in the war. At 13:20, they began to fire at the Syrians, and about 40 rounds the latter began to retreat. The Israelis also fired into Samakh, where the Syrian officers, who had until then believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> had nothing that could hit their headquarters, took shelter. One projectile hit the Syrian ammunition depot in the village, and others ignited fires in the dry fields. While the soldiers who operated the cannons (still lacking sights) were not proficient in handling them, an acceptable level of accuracy was achieved after practice shots into the Sea of Galilee. In all, the artillery fire took the Syrian army by complete surprise, and the latter decided to regroup and retreat to Tel al-Qasr, also recalling the company at Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada. A total of 500 shells were fired by the Israeli artillery. Syrian officers may have shot some of their fleeing soldiers.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2011, a United Nations report {{concluded}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> naval blockade was legal, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> action was [...] "excessive".

50|$|The {{commission}} of experts headed by <b>the</b> retired <b>Israeli</b> Supreme Court Judge Edmond Levy issued on July 9, 2012 its {{report on the}} status of the territories conquered by Israel in 1967. <b>The</b> commission concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> control over those territories is not an occupation in the legal sense, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> settlements in those territories do not contravene international law.|$|R
25|$|The Arabs claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> had massacred Arab civilians, but the Israelis {{rejected}} the claims.

Following the operation, the Tel Aviv-Haifa road was open to Israeli military and civilian traffic, and Arab roadblocks along the route were removed. Traffic along the Haifa-Hadera coastal railway was also restored.|$|E
25|$|Gat {{wrote that}} frantic Jewish {{registration}} for denaturalisation and departure {{was driven by}} knowledge that the denaturalisation law was due to expire in March 1951. He also noted the influence of further pressures including the property-freezing law and continued anti-Jewish disturbances, which raised the fear of large-scale pogroms. According to Mendes, it was highly unlikely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> would have taken such measures to accelerate the Jewish evacuation given that they were already struggling {{to cope with the}} existing level of Jewish immigration.|$|E
25|$|Israelis {{allege that}} Palestinians are {{deliberately}} removing {{significant amounts of}} archaeological evidence about the Jewish past of the site and claim to have found significant artifacts in the fill removed by bulldozers and trucks from the Temple Mount. Since the Waqf is granted almost full autonomy on the Islamic holy sites, Israeli archaeologists have been prevented from inspecting the area, and are restricted to conducting excavations around the Temple Mount. Muslims allege <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> are deliberately damaging the remains of Islamic-era buildings found in their excavations.|$|E

25|$|When Israeli {{authorities}} {{failed to}} negotiate a political solution, they decided that their only option was an attack to rescue the hostages. Lt. Col. Joshua Shani, lead pilot of the operation, later said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> had initially conceived of a rescue plan that involved dropping naval commandos into Lake Victoria. The commandos would have ridden rubber boats to the airport located {{on the edge of}} the lake. They planned to kill the hijackers and after freeing the hostages, they would ask Amin for passage home. The Israelis abandoned this plan because they lacked the necessary time and they also received word that Lake Victoria was infested with crocodiles.|$|E
25|$|Palestinians {{have sought}} to retroactively judge Israeli actions in the 1940s under new norms {{developing}} {{in the late twentieth}} and early twenty-first centuries. But international law does not work like that. Though it is no doubt deeply unsatisfying to Palestinians and their many supporters, the correct legal {{answer to the question of}} whether the 1947–49 refugees have a right of return under international law goes something like this: even if (or assuming <b>that)</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> did intentionally expel every Palestinian refugee, it was not illegal when it occurred, though it almost certainly would be if done today under the same circumstances; and the law at the time did not require repatriation of the refugees to Israel, though it most likely would if the expulsion were to occur today.|$|E
25|$|Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion {{personally}} {{ordered the}} wrecks of the RAF fighters {{that had been}} shot down to be dragged into Israeli territory. Israeli troops subsequently visited the crash sites, removed various parts, and buried the other aircraft. However, the Israelis did not manage to conceal the wrecks in time to prevent British reconnaissance planes from photographing them. An RAF salvage team was deployed to recover the wrecks, entering Israeli territory during their search. Two were discovered inside Egypt, while Tattersfield's Tempest was found north of Nirim, four miles inside Israel. Interviews with local Arabs confirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> had visited the crash sites to remove and bury the wrecks. Tattersfield was initially buried near the wreckage, but his body was later removed and reburied at the British War Cemetery in Ramla.|$|E

25|$|On 22 September 2006, French Air Force jets {{were seen}} over the skies of Beirut during Hassan Nasrallah's victory speech, {{possibly}} trying {{to protect him from}} an Israeli assassination attempt. Nasrallah told the crowd that he had no fear in addressing the masses directly, rather than through armored glass. In September 2006, Hezbollah fighters raided an Israeli arms depot in Shomera, and made off with a large quantity of sidearms, grenades, anti-tank weapons, and LAU rockets. Five Israeli Merkava tanks, an armored bulldozer, and a number of military vehicles entered Lebanon and attempted to search the Hezbollah-controlled village of Marwahin for the arms. They were confronted by four French Army Leclerc tanks, which blocked their advance. The confrontation lasted for half an hour. According to American and German correspondents, the French retreated, while the French commander claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> had turned back. French commander of UNIFIL Alain Pellegrini stated that France would not intervene to disarm Hezbollah.|$|E
25|$|Outside {{the police}} station, {{both sides were}} still firing on each other. A few wounded Israelis who were unable to take cover in the nearby {{buildings}} lay stranded on the streets. The Egyptians concentrated their fire against the paratroopers in the building. The Israelis decided to release a police officer to inform the Egyptians of their desire to surrender, provided the Egyptians guaranteed {{they would not be}} harmed. The police officer left the building and told Sarhan <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> wanted to surrender. Sarhan took the officer to Colonel Fathy 'Abbas, head of intelligence in the southern sector of the canal. 'Abbas met both men before noon that day, and was enthusiastic to accept the Israeli surrender and end the fighting, especially considering the potential intelligence gains. 'Abbas asked both men {{to go back to the}} police station and negotiate terms of surrender with the Israelis. They were unable to enter the building however, as the shooting would not stop and there was no overall commander in control of the militia surrounding the police station. The police officer, an old man, lost his nerve and would not come near the building. Consequently, no negotiations took place and there would be no Israeli surrender.|$|E
25|$|Schlesinger had {{an abiding}} {{interest}} in strategic theory, {{but he also}} had to deal with a succession of immediate crises that tested his administrative and political skills. In October 1973, three months after he took office, Arab countries launched a surprise attack on Israel and started the Yom Kippur War. A few days after the war started, with Israel not faring as well as expected militarily, the Soviets resupplying some Arab countries and the Israeli government having authorized the use and assembly of nuclear weapons, the United States began an overt operation to airlift materiel to Israel. As Schlesinger explained, the initial U.S. policy to avoid direct involvement rested on the assumption that Israel would win quickly. But when it became clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> faced more formidable military forces than anticipated, and could not meet their own resupply arrangements, the United States took up the burden. Schlesinger rejected charges that the Defense Department delayed the resupply effort to avoid irritating the Arab states and that he had had a serious disagreement over this matter with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Eventually the combatants agreed to a cease-fire, but not before the Soviet Union threatened to intervene on the Arab side and the United States declared a higher level worldwide alert of its forces.|$|E

25|$|The Challenger 1 {{accelerated}} {{its course}} {{in an attempt}} to allow journalists on board to broadcast their photos of the ongoing raid. The ship was intercepted by two Israeli speedboats and a helicopter, and carried out evasion tactics, forcing the Israelis to pursue it for a considerable distance. According to passengers, at least one stun grenade was launched at the Challenger 1 before it was boarded. Passengers on the decks formed a human chain to block the path of the troops. Soldiers opened fire with paintball guns and rubber and plastic bullets as they boarded the vessel, lightly injuring two female demonstrators. Once on board, the Israelis moved towards the fly bridge. The soldiers encountered verbal abuse, and attempts were made to shove soldiers. Some activists barricaded themselves in cabins. Activist Huwaida Arraf reported that Israeli soldiers attacked those who tried to block them with kicks, tasers, and concussion grenades, and that some people were beaten so severely that they had to be hospitalized. Arraf said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> smashed her face against the ground and stepped on it, and that they later handcuffed her and put a bag over her head. Another woman similarly had a bag placed over her head. First mate Shane Dillon reported that Israeli troops broke the nose of a Belgian woman and beat another passenger. Australian photojournalist Kate Geraghty was tasered while attempting to photograph the raid. Upon entering the bridge, the troops were met with no resistance.|$|E

[...] Abu Rahma said shooting was also coming from the Palestinian National Security Forces outpost, but that they were not shooting when Muhammad was hit. The Israeli fire was being directed at this Palestinian outpost, he said. He told National Public Radio: ...|$|E
500|$|Despite assaulting Latrun on five {{separate}} occasions Israel was ultimately unable to capture Latrun, and it remained under Jordanian control until the Six-Day War. The battles were so decisive <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> decided {{to construct a}} bypass surrounding Latrun so as to allow vehicular movement between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, thus avoiding the main road. Regardless, during the Battle for Jerusalem, the Jewish population of Jerusalem could still be supplied by a new road, named the [...] "Burma Road", that bypassed Latrun and was suitable for convoys. The Battle of Latrun left its imprint on the Israeli collective imagination and constitutes part of the [...] "founding myth" [...] of the Jewish State. The attacks cost the lives of 168 Israeli soldiers, but some accounts inflated this number {{to as many as}} 2,000. The combat at Latrun also carries a symbolic significance because of the participation of Holocaust survivors.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{after his}} detention, Berland was released.

In an interview with Israeli media shortly after his release, Berland claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police had told him <b>that</b> <b>the</b> claims were nonsense, and a follower claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> media outlets which originally reported the allegations were now treating them as untrue in their more recent broadcasts.
