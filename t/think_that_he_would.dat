5|$|The {{top three}} drivers of both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. After the first race, Giovinazzi {{said he had been}} amazed at his first victory in the GP2 Series and thanked his team and his primary sponsor. He stated that he did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> able to secure his first victory before the season was over, and was happy to score the points he earned for himself and his team. Sirotkin said the race was not easy for him because {{he did not have the}} start he intended. He said that he was happy with his second-place result but would not to be content finishing in either second or third in every event. Marciello stated that he expected some safety cars to affect the race but was unhappy with how many there were as they had prevented him building a large enough gap to his rivals. He said that his third-place finish was good for his team and revealed that he was not surprised when Sirotkin passed him on the start/finish straight on the first race's final lap as he saw him close up to him under the safety car.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and appeared later at a press conference. Franchitti was happy with the victory, saying {{that he did not}} {{think that it would be}} different to win at the track but that it was [...] "very, very special". He said that after his first pit stop he did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be able to win the race, and praised his team for their work. Da Matta stated that he was worried about his advantage in the points standings and felt he had the car which could win the event. He added that he could not relax because other drivers still had a mathematical chance of clinching the championship, but he was pleased with the result. Third-place finisher Carpentier said he was happy with his position and that it was a good day for his team. He revealed that changes made to his aerodynamic setup worked on the rolling restarts although it slowed him on the backstraight. Franchitti's race engineer Allen McDonald praised his driver, saying his first victory on an oval track was one that he would remember and that it was an [...] "unbelievable day".|$|E
500|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The plot of the production was criticized by a film reviewer The New York Dramatic Mirror because the boy grows up unaware that his stepfather had died or {{that her mother had}} moved to the city in search of work. The reviewer states, [...] "One would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have kept in communication with his mother if he loved her so much, but it appears he did not..." [...] The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast includes both Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane, two early leading actors of the Thanhouser Company. Carey L. Hastings, real name Carey Tidball, was a sister of Gertrude Thanhouser and was an actress that was featured in numerous Thanhouser productions. Hastings first and earliest known work was Thanhouser's St. Elmo adaptation. Hastings would not have another known credit until 1912. The Silent Era website states that Harry Benham and Maude Fealy had roles in the production. However, both of these credits are well-before those attributed by Bowers. Harry Benham is known to have joined the Thanhouser Company in 1910, but the first credit cited by Bowers is The Old Curiosity Shop in January 1911. Bowers also cites Maude Fealy having made only intermittent appearances with the first being The Early Life of David Copperfield in October 1911. Other credits amongst the cast are unknown, but most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions.|$|E

50|$|The women {{gather the}} {{following}} evening at Susan's {{to discuss the}} mysterious note {{that was used to}} blackmail Mary Alice. Susan <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> they should share the letter with Paul since it could be used as evidence to find the writer. Gabrielle <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> break down. Bree agrees but Lynette scoffs at the suggestion since it would only make matters worse. The four leave without a resolution and decide to talk about it in the morning.|$|R

2500|$|J.H. Whitney & Company {{was founded}} by John Hay Whitney who put up $10 million after World War II to finance {{entrepreneurs}} with business plans who were unwelcome at banks. Mr. Whitney brought in Benno Schmidt as his partner to run the company. When starting the company, Whitney wanted a broad team of young experts to be his deputies. He went to the deans of Harvard Business School, Yale Law School, and the MIT Graduate School of Engineering and asked each man who the best student they produced {{in the past five}} years was. The HBS dean cleverly responded that he was insulted that Whitney would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> simply rank his best students and hand the list out, but that if he was to do such an outrageous thing, he would rank C. Wrede Petersmeyer, a graduate the previous year, first. Whitney hired Petersmeyer the next day, and Petersmeyer went on to become a partner at the firm and run Whitney Communications.|$|E

2500|$|Brandon and Phillip's {{idea for}} the murder was {{inspired}} years earlier by conversations with their prep-school housemaster, publisher Rupert Cadell (Stewart). While they were at school, Rupert had discussed with them, in an apparently approving way, the intellectual concepts of Nietzsche's Übermensch, and De Quincey's art of murder, {{as a means of}} showing one's superiority over others. He too is among the guests at the party, since Brandon in particular <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> approve of their [...] "work of art".|$|R

5000|$|... "Maud Muller" [...] is a poem from 1856 {{written by}} John Greenleaf Whittier (1807-1892). It {{is about a}} {{beautiful}} maid named Maud Muller. One day, while harvesting hay, she meets a judge from the local town. Each is smitten with the other. The judge <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{like to be a}} local farmer married to Maud, while she <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> she would like to be the wealthy judge's wife. Neither voices these thoughts, however, and both the judge and the maiden move on. The judge marries a woman of wealth whose love for him is based on his riches. Maud Muller marries a young uneducated farmer. Throughout the rest of their lives, each remembers the day of their meeting and remorsefully reflects on what might have been.|$|R

50|$|Arnaldo Andre {{made many}} protagonic couples with Luisa Kuliok. His {{character}} from Amo y Señor was noted for his slapping of his wife. The first slap {{was used in}} a promotion of the telenovela at its early stages, and the positive popular reception turned this into a cliché. He kept on slapping his fellow actresses in later telenovelas, and always slapped them for real; which caused an incident with Giselle Blondet, who {{was not aware of}} it. Arnaldo André retired his slapping act after Carlos Monzón was sentenced for the death of his wife, in a widely publicized trial. Nowadays, Arnaldo André <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not do a similar character, because of the public concern about corporal punishment in the home. <b>He</b> also <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> feminism is greater now than in the 1980s, and a female character submissive to corporal punishment would not be considered realistic by the public anymore.|$|R
