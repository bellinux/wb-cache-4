50|$|A swage nut or self-clinching nut {{is a type}} of nut or <b>threaded</b> <b>insert</b> is used {{on sheet}} metal. A PEM® nut is a popular brand name by Penn Engineering & Manufacturing Corp, which is often used generically for swage nuts from any manufacturer.|$|E
5000|$|Threaded inserts are {{commonly}} used in plastic casings, housing, and parts to create a metal thread (typically: Brass or Stainless Steel) to allow for screws {{to be used in}} the assembly of many consumer electronics and consumer products. These may be cast in place in injection molded parts or they may be added by thermal insertion. In the latter, the insert is heated and then pressed into a hollow in the plastic part. The heat causes local melting in the plastic. [...] Ultrasonic Insertion is the process used to apply vibration and pressure to install the <b>threaded</b> <b>insert</b> into a molded hollow boss (hole) of a plastic part. The ultrasonic vibrations melt the plastic where the metal insert is in contact, and pressure is applied to press it into position. The plastic material typically reforms around the knurled body of the <b>threaded</b> <b>insert</b> to ensure a good retention.|$|E
50|$|A rivet nut, {{also known}} as a blind rivet nut or <b>threaded</b> <b>insert,</b> is a {{one-piece}} internally threaded and counterbored tubular rivet that can be anchored entirely from one side. There are two types: one is designed to form a bulge on {{the back side of the}} panel as a screw is tightened in its threads. The other is similarly drawn in using a screw, but is drawn into the sleeve instead of creating a bulge.|$|E

50|$|A <b>{{threaded}}</b> <b>insert,</b> {{also known}} as a threaded bushing, is a fastener element that is inserted into an object to add a threaded hole. They may be used to repair a stripped threaded hole, provide a durable threaded hole in a soft material, place a thread on a material too thin to accept it, mold or cast threads into a workpiece thereby eliminating a machining operation, or simplify changeover from unified to metric threads or vice versa.|$|E
50|$|The AAW team {{knew that}} the car would not last the whole race, so they fueled it for only ten laps {{in order to make}} a quick press run. This {{compensated}} the overweight of their TS16 and Kinnunen managed to overtake five cars in eight laps before a spark plug problem forced him to retire. Kinnunen later told that one spark plug thread in the cylinder head had been stripped. A Ferrari mechanic loaned them a <b>threaded</b> <b>insert</b> kit to fix it but the Finns did not master the method and the plug never seated properly.|$|E
50|$|The {{second type}} of captive nut is a <b>threaded</b> <b>insert.</b> These are either pressed into holes in the {{material}} to be joined or moulded in. In either case, part of the insert is generally knurled {{to get a good}} grip on the material supporting the insert. One variant, the swage nut, has a knurled portion that swages the sides of a soft metal hole to more tightly grip the nut. Press fit and swaged captive nuts are used in panels that are too thin to be threaded or in soft materials that are too weak to be threaded. They are installed by pressing them in with an arbor press.|$|E

40|$|Composite {{sandwich}} structures offers several advantages over conventional structural {{materials such as}} lightweight, high bending and torsional stiffness, superior thermal insulation and excellent acoustic damping. In the aerospace industry, sandwich composites are commonly manufactured using the autoclave process which is associated with high operating cost. Out-of-autoclave (OOA) manufacturing {{has been shown to}} be capable of producing low cost and high performance composites. In this paper we present results of experimental testing of various sandwich materials according various standards and actual requirements in transport industry. We compared the different types of surface and paint systems, because these layers are the most important in contact with the surrounding environment and load conditions. In the experimental measurements were used various materials. For the core of the sandwich structure were selected aluminium honeycomb, aramid honeycomb and PET (Polyethylene terephthalate) foam core. Support layers were chosen two kinds of predimpregnated materials. The conditions of measurements were requirements for strength and rigidity, safety - flame resistance and reflectivity resistance. The samples were tested at the 3 - point bending test according to standard EN ISO 178, by modified test to determine the force required to rapture <b>threaded</b> <b>insert,</b> by test of reflectivity according to UIC CODE 844 - 4 R and according to standard EN 45545 - 2 fire protection of railway vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Precast {{concrete}} {{panels are}} a popular construction technique {{due to their}} increased construction speed, low cost {{and the ability to}} use the precast concrete elements for structural walls to provide high strength and stiffness when used for structural purposes. Slender precast concrete wall panels are a common construction method for single storey warehouse type buildings. Following the Canterbury earthquake sequence Christchurch from 2010 – 2014, damage was observed in precast concrete wall buildings that resulted in out-of-plane collapse of wall panels.. This project seeks to investigate the behaviour of precast reinforced concrete walls designed for limited ductility under gravity and quasi-static in-plane loading. The main point of interest in this thesis research is to understand the seismic behaviour of the connection as well as the out-of-plane stability of slender panels. To investigate the behaviour of this panel and connection type, three slender precast concrete walls, representing full scale panel geometry were subjected to quasi-static cyclic loading. Two common panel to foundation connection types were studied: 1) threaded inserts and 2) traditional starter bars as well as one alternative connection which was developed as a means to improve the out-of-plane response and understand the impact of this design choice on the in-plane behavior of the wall. For all the three units, the dowel connection performed well and the thin wall failed under flexural failure due to loss of strength cause by fracturing of longitudinal rebars after being buckled under the effects of lateral cyclic loading. Significant horizontal cracking occurred on each of the tests at dowel level except unit <b>threaded</b> <b>insert</b> with 50 mm cover behind the head of the insert (TI 12 -C 50 -IP) which suffered a secondary horizontal crack at 500 mm above the main crack and a diagonal crack {{at the center of the}} wall. Moreover, this unit was able to undergo more deformation due to a secondary crack...|$|E
40|$|In two-sided {{structural}} cold plates, typically {{there is}} a structural member, such as a honeycomb panel, that provides the structural strength for the cold plates that cool equipment. The cold plates are located {{on either side of}} the structural member and thus need to have the cooling fluid supplied to them. One method of accomplishing this is to route the inlet and outlet tubing to both sides of the structural member. Another method might be to supply the inlet to one side and the outlet to the other. With the latter method, an external feature such as a hose, tube, or manifold must be incorporated to pass the fluid from one side of the structural member to the other. Although this is a more compact design than the first option, since it eliminates the need for a dedicated supply and return line to each side of the structural member, it still poses problems, as these external features can be easily damaged and are now new areas for potential fluid leakage. This invention eliminates the need for an external feature and instead incorporates the feature internally to the structural member. This is accomplished by utilizing a <b>threaded</b> <b>insert</b> that not only connects the cold plate to the structural member, but also allows the cooling fluid to flow through it into the structural member, and then to the cold plate on the opposite side. The insert also employs a cap that acts as a cover to seal the open area needed to install the insert. There are multiple options for location of o-ring style seals, as well as the option to use adhesive for redundant sealing. Another option is to weld the cap to the cold plate after its installation, thus making it an integral part of the structural member. This new configuration allows the fluid to pass from one cold plate to the other without any exposed external features...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of model Francis runner {{to be used}} in the Waterpower laboratory at NTNU is a length and costly process. Due to the production cost there are years between each time a new Francis model is bought. The Tokke Francis model at Waterpower laboratory, was given from the industry after they had run model tests in the laboratory when design- ing the Tokke prototype. In order to give the students at the Waterpower laboratory an opportunity to design their own turbines and test, the production cost must be significantly reduced. To be able to do that, new designs need to be developed and new production method used. The objective of this thesis is to carry out a new mechanical design of a Francis model runner and evaluate different mechanical designs of guide vanes and stay vanes. The new alternative designs were made with a combination of standard production methods and material, and new plastic materials from rapid prototyping such as selective laser sintering (SLS) and rapid CNC machining. To carry out the new mechanical runner design, the MATLAB design software Khoj was used. From Khoj two sets of streamlines were generated, one set for the sucction side and one for the pressure side. Then the streamlines were imported into the CAD program PTC Creo Parametric and a 3 D-model of the design was made. Two test pieces in a polyamide material was made using selective laser sintering. One of the test pieces was tested for pull-out strength using some self tapping thread inserts, the results showed that the pull-out strength was more than good enough. The <b>threaded</b> <b>insert</b> could be used to attach the runner vanes to the hub and ring. The main focus of this thesis has been the new mechanical design of a model runner and runner vanes. The model design was not produced and tested in the laboratory due to lack of time and money. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} more {{automated}} process for drawing and twisting of graphene fibers than was currently in place. This was implemented by having two chemical baths with variable speed rollers at either end, and intermediate roller to spool fiber between stages, and a twisting cylinder with integral spool to twist the fiber as it is collected. The goal was to have this first iteration deliver a working prototype, however due to manufacturing delays and timing constraints, that will be missed. A second follow-on project would be able to continue the work presented here and fulfil the stated aims of the project. The bulk of the structure is fabricated from PVC pieces waterjet cut from a large sheet. This allowed for quick manufacture of most pieces in the design. From there, some secondary machining was done to add mounting and fastening locations. PVC pieces were attached to one another primarily through the use of # 8 - 32 screws with washers and a brass <b>threaded</b> <b>insert.</b> Due to PVC being a soft material, tapping threads into it directly was avoided. The baths were sealed mostly with an automotive gasket compound to permanently seal one half, while one wall was sealed with a silicon gasket laser cut from a sheet. This makes the bath wall removable for maintenance. Two baths were made to allow multiple stages of drawing or one coagulation stage immediately followed by a drawing stage. From the drawing, the fiber advances to the auxiliary roller. The range of speeds required to get desired properties at all stages did not permit the fiber to go from coagulation to drawing to twisting in one process, therefore following the drawing bath, it is wound on to the auxiliary roller. After the drawing process is finished, the fiber can be pulled from the auxiliary roller into the twisting mechanism, running at a lower speed so as to give the requisite number of turns per length of fiber to yield the optimal fiber twist angle. The twisting mechanism is a PVC cylinder supported on horizontal rods and driven by a motor mounted beneath the cylinder and connected via a plastic belt. The cylinder, motor, and support rods are encased in a box with one face open to allow the fiber into the cylinder. Inside the cylinder is a spinning rod mounted across the diameter that collects the fiber as it is twisted. The aim of the project called for a quick-release mechanism so that the rod can be removed quickly for storage of the fiber or other testing steps. All of the motion is powered by small 5 V DC motors that go through a 20 : 1 worm gear reduction. This increases the torque while decreasing the speed from roughly 10, 000 RPM to more useful ranges. The motors are powered through a NPN power transistor with the logic being controlled by an Arduino Nano that takes in an analog voltage and converts it to a PWM waveform to control the motor duty cycle. In total, the project came in under budget, using 84. 01 % of the $ 1500 allocated for the project. A third of this cost came from the need to expedite the waterjet cutting by going to a third-party outside of the campus community. Had on campus resources been successfully utilized, the total cost would have been closer to the $ 925. 38 estimate first presented...|$|E
