5|$|The Wrights {{were glad}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>from</b> the {{distraction}} of reporters. The absence of newsmen also reduced {{the chance of}} competitors learning their methods. After the Kitty Hawk powered flights, the Wrights {{made a decision to}} begin withdrawing from the bicycle business so they could concentrate on creating and marketing a practical airplane. This was financially risky, since they were neither wealthy nor government-funded (unlike other experimenters such as Ader, Maxim, Langley and Alberto Santos-Dumont). The Wright brothers did not have the luxury of being able to give away their invention; it was to be their livelihood. Thus, their secrecy intensified, encouraged by advice from their patent attorney, Henry Toulmin, not to reveal details of their machine.|$|E

5|$|Inside the elevator, Henry asks Archie why {{he refuses}} {{to believe that he}} is Jiminy Cricket. Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>from</b> being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in her pocket and throws it down the shaft, where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E

5|$|Orkos– Also {{known as}} The Giver in Rise of the Warrior, {{he was the}} keeper of oaths sworn to the gods and {{is the son of}} Ares and Alecto. In Rise of the Warrior, he {{followed}} the redeemed warrior through his journey and imprisoned him in the Prison of the Damned due to the warrior breaking his father's oath. Later in Ascension, Orkos helped Kratos by enabling him to see through illusions. He also provided Kratos with his Oath Stone, allowing Kratos to be in two places at once. Orkos revealed to Kratos Ares' and the Furies' plan to overthrow Olympus, and that Ares chose Kratos to help him do so. After Kratos defeated the Furies, Orkos told him that in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>from</b> Ares' bond, Kratos would have to kill Orkos. After begging for an honorable death, Kratos reluctantly killed him, freeing them both from Ares. The character was voiced by Troy Baker in Ascension.|$|E
5|$|Schmerber {{submitted}} {{an appeal}} to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari on January 17, 1966. In his brief, Schmerber argued, inter alia, that the warrantless blood test violated his Fourth Amendment right <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>from</b> unlawful searches and seizures, as well as his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Los Angeles City Attorney's office represented the State of California on appeal. In their brief, the City Attorney argued that the blood test did not violate the Fourth Amendment because the seizure was conducted incident to a lawful arrest. The City Attorney also argued that admitting the sample into evidence did not violate Schmerber's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because blood is not testimonial evidence under the Fifth Amendment. Oral arguments were held on April 25, 1966, and the Court issued its opinion on June 20, 1966.|$|E

25|$|Non-refractory woods: These woods can be rapidly {{seasoned}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>from</b> defects even {{by applying}} high temperatures (dry-bulb temperatures {{of more than}} 100°C) in industrial kilns.

25|$|Typical {{metamorphic}} mineralogy is tremolite-chlorite, or talc-chlorite mineralogy in {{the upper}} spinifex zones. The more magnesian-rich olivine-rich flow base facies tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>from</b> tremolite and chlorite mineralogy and are dominated by either serpentine-brucite +/- anthophyllite if hydrated, or talc-magnesite if carbonated.

25|$|Highly {{refractory}} woods: These woods {{are slow}} {{and difficult to}} dry if the final product is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>from</b> defects, particularly cracks and splits. Examples are heavy structural timbers with high density such as ironbark (Eucalyptus paniculata), blackbutt (E. pilularis), southern blue gum (E. globulus) and brush box (Lophostemon cofertus). They require considerable protection and care against rapid drying conditions for the best results (Bootle, 1994).|$|E
25|$|Subject peoples {{all over}} the Austro-Hungarian empire wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>from</b> {{the rule of the}} old {{aristocracy}} and the imperial family.

25|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>from</b> {{suffering}} and stress, Theravadins {{believe that the}} defilements need to be permanently uprooted. Initially the defilements are restrained through mindfulness {{to prevent them from}} taking over mental and bodily action. They are then uprooted through internal investigation, analysis, experience and understanding of their true nature by using jhāna. This process needs to be repeated for each and every defilement. The practice will then lead the meditator to realize Nirvana.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the most}} vocal proponents of the attack was Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Vasa Fox. Fox had an ulterior motive, in that he wanted the Navy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>from</b> {{domination}} by the Army. He was therefore not disturbed when General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck would not agree to a major part for the Army in the operation. Halleck was willing to commit only 10,000 to 15,000 untrained soldiers, who would exploit any successes made by the naval force but would not otherwise have an active role.|$|E

25|$|Callability — Some bonds {{give the}} issuer {{the right to}} repay the bond before the {{maturity}} date on the call dates; see call option. These bonds {{are referred to as}} callable bonds. Most callable bonds allow the issuer to repay the bond at par. With some bonds, the issuer has to pay a premium, the so-called call premium. This is mainly the case for high-yield bonds. These have very strict covenants, restricting the issuer in its operations. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>from</b> these covenants, the issuer can repay the bonds early, but only at a high cost.|$|E
