5|$|Upon his death, Hergé left {{around one}} hundred and fifty pages of pencil {{sketches}} for the story. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> had no ending, and is left on a cliffhanger, with Tintin's fate left unexplained.|$|E
5|$|James Van Hise and Hal Schuster {{wrote in}} their 1995 book, The Complete Next Generation, {{that they thought}} the {{relationship}} between Picard and Daren was believable, and that <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> was very effective. They thought that the loneliness Picard feels {{at the end of}} the episode was part of an ongoing story which would culminate in the subplot about Picard's loneliness in Star Trek Generations.|$|E
5|$|These three {{objects are}} also {{mentioned}} in <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> (see below), and {{are said to}} belong to the Peverell brothers, who are later revealed as being both Voldemort's and Harry Potter's ancestors. Towards the end of the novel, Albus Dumbledore also confirms Harry's connection to the Peverells, and states that the three brothers might in fact have been the creators of the Hallows.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>story</b> is <b>itself</b> heavily {{indebted to}} H. P. Lovecraft's story [...] "The Thing on the Doorstep".|$|R
5000|$|... <b>the</b> Heike <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> chronicling <b>the</b> Taira/Genji Heian period, oft {{interpreted}} as one phase of Buddhisms six worlds. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> {{is treated as}} a shōdō, or sermon {{with the purpose of}} enlightenment.|$|R

5|$|When Refn {{read the}} first {{screenplay}} for Drive, he was more intrigued by {{the concept of a}} man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself.</b> Believing that the director might be intimidated by the script as it was unlike anything he had done before, Gosling had concerns about Refn's desire to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation.|$|E
5|$|The story {{focuses on}} Class Zero, {{a group of}} {{fourteen}} students from the Vermillion Peristylium, a magical academy in the Dominion of Rubrum. When the Militesi Empire launches {{an assault on the}} other Crystal States of Orience, seeking to control their respective crystals, Class Zero is mobilized for the defense of Rubrum. Eventually, the group becomes entangled in the secrets behind both the war and the reason for their existence. The setting and presentation were inspired by historical documentaries, and <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> was written to be darker than other Final Fantasy titles.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the player}} visits the Moogle's shop and discovers {{it has been}} {{attacked}} by a giant Heartless. The player helps four Keyblade wielders chase down the Heartless in the sewers but it proves to be very powerful while in water. While the four Keyblade wielders hold it off, the player drains out the water and defeats the giant Heartless. Afterwards, they return to the Moogle's shop just as the Moogle has repaired the damage and returns to chat with the four Keyblade Wielders, who now admit that they are friends and continues {{to assist them in}} various missions (either together, separately, or alone). Throughout this point, significant scenes are shown as the player progresses (which actually take place in the real world either before or after the Keyblade War): the first scene takes place {{after the end of the}} Keyblade War, where Ephemer meets up with Skuld, revealing that they are two of the five people selected to become new Foretellers. Two others selected Keyblade Wielders, Ventus and Brain, appear to greet them followed by the fifth selected person, Lauriam (who is the original form of Marluxia). Later, they come to the Foreteller's room where they learn that they must start their own unions and to avoid the terrible incidents that happened in the past, they decide to create Spirit Dream Eaters to help the other Keyblade Wielders. The second shows a flashback of the Master of Masters instructing Ava to form the Dandelions and select five of them to be the new Foretellers, who also plans to give the Book of Prophecies to one of them. Ava later informs this to Ephemer and plans to have him and four others become the new Foretellers. The third shows Chrithy informing Ephemer and Skuld that the player's character is dreaming and Ephemer warns them that a stronger source of darkness is coming and plans to form the Union Cross to stop it while encouraging Chrithy to protect the player. The fourth introduces Strelitzia, a Dandelion Keyblade Wielder who has secretly been following the player on their quest until being recruited by Ava, revealing that she is the true fifth selected Keyblade Wielder. She is skeptical of this but is encouraged by her Chrithy to do so, despite also having doubts. After realizing that the player is not a Dandelion, she decides to find and convince them to join the Dandelions. While searching a dark building, she and her Chrithy are ambushed by an unseen person, who steals the book that Ava gave her. The dying Strelitzia carries her Chrithy towards the door before they fade from existence. Later (taking place after the player fights Master Aced), <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> goes through an entirely different plot after that. The player and Chrithy later meet another Chrithy, who entrusts them a gift from the Foretellers, a Spirit Dream Eater.|$|E
5000|$|Through Manwë, Tolkien {{suggests}} that the plot of <b>the</b> main <b>story</b> <b>itself,</b> <b>the</b> 500-year war of the Silmarils, {{is an example of}} this principle in action: ...|$|R
50|$|It stars Jayaram, Samyuktha Varma, Lal, Manya, Kalabhavan Mani and Narendra Prasad in pivotal roles. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> unfurls <b>itself</b> in <b>the</b> {{course of}} a TV game show.|$|R
50|$|Provjereno {{follows the}} typical {{television}} news magazine format and features four stories every episode. Each story is {{introduced by the}} presenter after which <b>the</b> <b>story</b> segment <b>itself</b> is shown.|$|R
25|$|Later Mythos {{writers have}} {{suggested}} the Magna Mater ("Great Mother") worshipped by the Exham cult was Shub-Niggurath (though in <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> multiple references {{are made to}} Roman goddess Cybele, known as Magna Mater).|$|E
25|$|In 1962, Vicary {{admitted}} to lying about the experiment and falsifying the results, <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> being a marketing ploy. An identical experiment conducted by Henry Link showed {{no increase in}} cola or popcorn sales. The claim that the small cinema handled 45,699 visitors in six weeks has led {{people to believe that}} Vicary actually did not conduct his experiment at all.|$|E
25|$|During the Republican presidential {{primaries}} of 2012, candidate Herman Cain's 9-9-9 taxation {{proposal was}} widely {{attributed to a}} similar tax structure presented in SimCity4; the CNBC cable networks relayed {{the story of the}} linkage of the SimCity idealparameters as a possible origin of the taxation proposal (<b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> may have originated in the technical press), but Herman Cain denied any link to the game.|$|E
50|$|Playing as {{primarily}} Aragon, {{the player}} gathers {{a team of}} 12 heroes. The recruitment of team members, however, is non-linear and <b>the</b> <b>story</b> adjusts <b>itself</b> to <b>the</b> newest character that has joined.|$|R
5000|$|Despite his {{truncated}} career, {{the character}} [...] - [...] who in <b>the</b> origin <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> {{is referred to}} not as Bee-Man but as the Bee [...] - [...] developed a small cult following amid fans of obscure 1960s Silver Age superheroes.|$|R
5000|$|The last {{numbers of}} the comic were {{dedicated}} to themes that did not dealt with <b>the</b> comic <b>story</b> <b>itself,</b> including 8 whole numbers filled with a philosophical and metaphysical indoctrination manual called [...] "Manual del guerrero Kundalini" [...] (Kundalini Warrior Guide).|$|R
25|$|Russell T Davies has {{expressed}} a dislike for stories in which multiple incarnations of the Doctor meet, stating {{that he believes}} they {{focus more on the}} actors than on <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself.</b> In 2007, David Tennant showed enthusiasm for the idea of a multi-Doctor story, but expressed doubts about the practicality of episodes involving multiple previous Doctors, given that three of the actors who played the character were deceased.|$|E
25|$|Another common stylistic {{approach}} in his novels {{is the use}} of mixed genres, whereby elements of each are combined freely and interchangeably. Jack of Shadows and Changeling, for example, revolve around the tensions between the two worlds of magic and technology. Lord of Light, perhaps one of his most famous works, is written in the classic style of a mythic fantasy, while it is established early in the book that <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> takes place on a colonized planet.|$|E
25|$|While a {{habitual}} criminal, Makley cultivated {{the appearance}} and demeanor of a prosperous legitimate businessman. In between crimes {{he worked as}} a salesman and insurance agent, and could easily pass for a respectable citizen. A story often told of Makley is that some time in the mid-1920s after robbing a bank he went straight to a civic luncheon at which he was giving the keynote speech. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> is most likely apocryphal, but its popularity gives an insight into the man's charisma.|$|E
50|$|In January 2010, Bryce {{signed a}} 1-year deal with Brisbane Roar, but <b>the</b> <b>story</b> {{repeated}} <b>itself</b> and just {{after a few}} games he decided {{to put an end}} on his contract and definitively retire from football.|$|R
5000|$|The {{title is}} {{the first line of}} a message left for Seymour by his sister Boo Boo on the {{bathroom}} mirror of the family's apartment, which Buddy discovers towards the end of <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>The</b> message <b>itself</b> begins with a line taken from Sappho's fragment LP 111: ...|$|R
50|$|Collaboration with Sun renewed {{after the}} OpenDS project team's {{presentation}} at LdapCon in 2009 (a common LDAP API for the Java Platform(http://www.symas.com/ldapcon2009/papers/poitou1.shtml)). <b>The</b> <b>story</b> repeated <b>itself</b> once again after Oracle bought Sun in 2010, and its project team disbanded.|$|R
25|$|Last but not least, Nygard {{discusses}} the idea {{put forward by}} Sophus Bugge that <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> descends from the biblical tale of Judith and Holofernes. But, among other objections, Nygard points out that Holofernes didn't intend to kill Judith - he wanted sex with her - and hadn't murdered a succession of other maidens either, yet those murders {{seem to be at}} the heart of the ballad. He points out too that Bugge cherry-picks details occurring only in widely scattered variants that happen to fit with his biblical theory.|$|E
25|$|From {{this point}} on, the hero's future is {{entirely in the}} player's hands in an {{open-ended}} campaign in which the hero gains fame and notoriety before retiring. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> evolves in whatever manner the player chooses, and optimally ends with the player gaining enough fame points by completing various achievements to retire into a wealthy position in the Caribbean community. The highest retirement position {{is to be the}} Governor of a seafaring capital. The final position is dependent on one's fame, treasure and wealth, achievement points, ships sunk and ports looted.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} other {{unconfirmed}} accounts of European discovery and exploration, one tale by {{men from the}} Channel Islands being blown off course in the late 15th century into a strange land full of fish, and another from Portuguese maps that depict the Terra do Bacalhau, or land of codfish, west of the Azores. The earliest, though, is the Voyage of Saint Brendan, the fantastical account of an Irish monk who made a sea voyage in the early 6th century. While <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> {{became a part of}} myth and legend, some historians believe it is based on fact.|$|E
50|$|Every film made by Sana Yadireddy is {{different}} in its own way. He made films {{in a way that}} it’s not <b>the</b> film <b>story</b> <b>itself,</b> but <b>the</b> way the film is told that makes his movies nice. Filmography describes his opinion about society, human nature and life in general.|$|R
2500|$|Searches for Noah's Ark are {{considered}} by scholars {{an example of}} pseudoarchaeology. Kenneth Feder writes, [...] "As <b>the</b> flood <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> is unsupported by any archaeological evidence, {{it is not surprising}} that there is no archaeological evidence for the existence of an impossibly large boat dating to 5,000 years ago." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{setting of}} a fantasy work is often of great {{importance}} to the plot and characters of <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>The</b> setting <b>itself</b> can be imperiled by the evil of <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> suffer a calamity, and be restored by <b>the</b> transformation <b>the</b> <b>story</b> brings about. [...] <b>Stories</b> that use <b>the</b> setting as merely a backdrop for <b>the</b> <b>story</b> {{have been criticized for}} their failure to use it fully.|$|R
25|$|Sometimes the narrator's {{unreliability}} is made immediately evident. For instance, a {{story may}} open with the narrator making a plainly false or delusional claim or admitting to being severely mentally ill, or <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> {{may have a}} frame in which the narrator appears as a character, with clues to the character's unreliability. A more dramatic use of the device delays the revelation until near the story's end. In some cases, the reader discovers that in the foregoing narrative, the narrator had concealed or greatly misrepresented vital pieces of information. Such a twist ending forces readers to reconsider {{their point of view}} and experience of the story. In some cases the narrator's unreliability is never fully revealed but only hinted at, leaving readers to wonder how much the narrator should be trusted and how the story should be interpreted.|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} told {{from the point of}} view of a first-person narrator, about whom little is {{revealed}} before the final pages. Before <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself,</b> an extended meditation appears on the nature of human names, and that of Z. Marcas specifically: ...|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> {{is deeply}} {{informed}} by the Lone Wolf and Cub manga series. Novelist Max Allan Collins acknowledged the influence of Lone Wolf and Cub on his graphic novel Road to Perdition in an interview to the BBC, declaring that [...] "Road To Perdition is 'an unabashed homage' to Lone Wolf And Cub".|$|E
50|$|Set in {{the fantasy}} world of The Sundered Realm, <b>the</b> <b>story</b> {{concerns}} <b>itself</b> with <b>the</b> adventures of Fost Longstrider, a hard living warrior {{who makes a}} living as a courier and Princess Moriana Etuul, heir to the throne of the magical City in the Sky.|$|R
50|$|Part 2: “The Christmas Story” {{analyses}} {{aspects of}} <b>the</b> Christmas <b>story</b> <b>itself</b> (<b>the</b> Virgin Birth, the Star of Bethlehem, the Three Kings, the Stable at Bethlehem and the Massacre of the Innocents) {{by reference to}} earlier pagan myths. It also looks critically at the attempts of Christian apologists to explain these differences away.|$|R
5000|$|In the novel, Chihaya was a {{character}} in <b>the</b> side <b>stories</b> that was released along with the novel, but not part of <b>the</b> main <b>story</b> <b>itself.</b> In <b>the</b> side <b>stories,</b> Chihaya is not Kazuki's childhood friend but just a student from another class that {{had a crush on}} Kazuki. Chihaya is a shy and inward character and does not have the proper chance to convey her feelings to Kazuki.|$|R
