5|$|In the July 1932 election, <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> won 230 {{seats to}} become {{far and away}} the largest party in the Reichstag. By longstanding tradition, <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> were thus {{entitled}} to select the President of the Reichstag, and were able to elect Göring for the post.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{returns to}} his {{teaching}} position at a New England college, where he is interviewed by two Army Intelligence agents. They inform him that <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> are searching for his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the University of Chicago. <b>The</b> <b>Nazis</b> know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of Tanis in Egypt, and that he possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Jones deduces that <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> are searching for the Ark of the Covenant – <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> believe that if they acquire the Ark, their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra {{is the key to}} finding the Well of Souls, a secret chamber in which the Ark is buried.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the allies}} of <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> passed their own {{versions}} of the Nuremberg Laws.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nazis</b> also {{targeted}} {{religious groups}} {{for political and}} ideological reasons. Thousands of Christian clergy were killed, including some with a Jewish background (Edith Stein, for example). <b>The</b> <b>Nazis</b> considered Jews a racial group; secular people {{and those of other}} religions who had Jewish ancestry were, therefore, Jews (a belief shared by some Jews).|$|E
5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> arrive, Rosier and Lundi are {{revealed}} {{to be members of}} the French Resistance; they are arrested and tortured during interrogation. <b>The</b> <b>Nazis</b> round up the Romani and send them to concentration camps. Claude, cared for by Rosier, chooses to go with the Romani.|$|E
5|$|Current {{estimates}} of the number of Poles who were killed by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> for aiding Jews range in the tens of thousands.|$|E
5|$|Deceased. A gun-toting vigilante, {{motivated}} by the deaths of her parents and sister {{at the hands of}} <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> in their native Austria. Zandt is killed along with her lesbian lover in what is implied to be a hate-crime.|$|E
5|$|During the interwar {{period and}} the time of the Soviet occupation, Steinhaus contributed ten {{problems}} to the famous Scottish Book, including the last one, recorded shortly before Lwów was captured by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> in 1941, during Operation Barbarossa.|$|E
5|$|Himmler was a main {{architect}} of the Holocaust, using his deep belief in the racist Nazi ideology to justify the murder of millions of victims. <b>The</b> <b>Nazis</b> planned to kill Polish intellectuals and restrict non-Germans in the General Government and conquered territories to a fourth-grade education. <b>The</b> <b>Nazis</b> wanted to breed a master race of racially pure Nordic Aryans in Germany. As an agronomist and farmer Himmler was acquainted {{with the principles of}} selective breeding, which he proposed to apply to humans. He believed that he could engineer the German populace, for example, through eugenics, to be Nordic in appearance within several decades {{of the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|In February 1933 {{while on}} a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> under Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Schmidt had {{secretly}} been sending money to British banks with fleeing refugees ever since <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> took power in Germany in January 1933. When she eventually {{tried to leave}} the country on 28 June 1939, Sicherheitsdienst (SD) agents arrested her at the Dutch border and took her to Gestapo headquarters. Once there she was seen by Walter Schellenberg, who at that time worked in the counter-intelligence department of the SD. He gave her an ultimatum: cooperate with <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> or be sent to a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|The Slavs {{were one}} of the most widely persecuted groups during the war, with many Poles, Russians, Ukrainians, Serbs and others killed by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The pair {{travels to}} Cairo, where they {{meet up with}} Indy's friend Sallah, a skilled excavator. Sallah informs them that Belloq and <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> are digging for the Well of Souls with {{a replica of the}} {{headpiece}} (created from the scar on Toht's hand). They quickly realize the Nazi headpiece is incomplete and that <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> are digging in the wrong place. <b>The</b> <b>Nazis</b> kidnap Marion and it appears to Jones that she is killed in an exploding truck. After a confrontation with Belloq in a local bar, Indy and Sallah infiltrate the Nazi dig site and use their staff to correctly locate the Ark. Indy discovers Marion is alive, bound and gagged in a tent, but does not release her for fear of alerting <b>the</b> <b>Nazis.</b> Indy, Sallah, and a small group of diggers unearth the Well of Souls and acquire the Ark. Belloq and Nazi officer Colonel Dietrich arrive, seize the Ark from Jones, throwing Marion into the Well of Souls with him before sealing it back up. Jones and Marion escape to a local airstrip, where Jones has a fistfight with a Nazi mechanic and destroys the flying wing that was to transport the Ark to Berlin. The panicked Nazis remove the Ark in a truck and set off for Cairo, but Jones catches them and retakes it. He makes arrangements to take the Ark to London aboard a tramp steamer.|$|E
5|$|While at American {{universities}} in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. He {{and his wife}} Elsa returned to Belgium by ship in March, and during the trip they learned that their cottage was raided by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> and his personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in Antwerp on 28 March, he immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship. <b>The</b> <b>Nazis</b> later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a Hitler Youth camp.|$|E
5|$|According {{to their}} {{eugenics}} policy, <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> {{believed that the}} disabled were a burden to society because they needed care and were considered an affront to their notion of a society composed of a perfect race. About 375,000 people were sterilized against their will due to their disabilities.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> came {{to power}} in January 1933, Heiden was arrested. On orders from Himmler and his chief {{lieutenant}} Reinhard Heydrich, he was murdered later that year by members of the Sicherheitsdienst ("Security Service"; SD). Heiden's corpse was found in September 1933 and he was buried on 15 September 1933.|$|E
5|$|Alison Doody as Dr. Elsa Schneider: An Austrian art {{professor}} {{who is in}} league with <b>the</b> <b>Nazis.</b> She seduces the Joneses to trick them. Doody was 21 when she auditioned {{and was one of}} the first actresses who met for the part.|$|E
5|$|Although Jews are an ethnoreligious group, {{they were}} defined by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> on purely racial grounds. The Nazi Party viewed the Jewish {{religion}} as irrelevant, persecuting Jews {{in accordance with}} antisemitic stereotypes of an alleged biologically determined heritage. Defining Jews as the chief enemy, Nazi racial ideology was also used to persecute other minorities.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the films}} from 20th Century Fox had large budgets, high {{production}} values and {{were set in}} the Victorian era, Universal Studios updated the films to have Holmes fighting <b>the</b> <b>Nazis,</b> and produced them as B pictures with lower budgets. Both Rathbone and Bruce continued their roles when the series changed studios, as did Mary Gordon, who played the recurring character Mrs. Hudson.|$|E
5|$|At Castle Brunwald, Indy rescues Henry, but {{learns that}} Elsa and Donovan are {{actually}} working with <b>the</b> <b>Nazis,</b> and are using {{him to find}} the Grail for them. Meanwhile, Marcus is captured in Hatay, while waiting with Sallah for the Joneses. The Joneses escape from Castle Brunwald. Henry tells Indy that to reach the Grail, one must face three booby traps and his diary contains the clues to guide them through the challenges safely. They recover the diary from Elsa at a book burning rally in Berlin. They then board a Zeppelin to leave Germany, but <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> soon discover the Joneses are aboard and they escape in a parasite biplane. They crash while engaging in a dogfight with Luftwaffe fighters.|$|E
5|$|At the time, many Japanese politicians, {{including}} Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (who was {{an outspoken}} critic of an alliance with Nazi Germany), were shocked by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. Nevertheless, the leaders of the military clique then in control in Tokyo concluded that it was a ruse designed to buy <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> time to match the British navy.|$|E
5|$|Austrian and Czech foreign {{exchange}} reserves were soon seized by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis,</b> as were stockpiles of raw materials such as metals and completed goods such as weaponry and aircraft, which were shipped back to Germany. The Reichswerke Hermann Göring industrial conglomerate took control of steel and coal production facilities in both countries.|$|E
5|$|By 1930, the {{violence}} between <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> and communists led to local SA troop leader Horst Wessel being shot by {{two members of}} the Communist Party of Germany. He later died in hospital. Exploiting Wessel's death, Goebbels turned him into a martyr for the Nazi movement. He officially declared Wessel's march Die Fahne hoch (Raise the flag), renamed as the Horst-Wessel-Lied, to be the NSDAP anthem.|$|E
5|$|Conrad Veidt as Major Heinrich Strasser. He was {{a refugee}} German actor who had {{appeared}} in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. He fled <b>the</b> <b>Nazis,</b> but was frequently cast as a Nazi in American films. A major star in German cinema before the Nazi era, he was the highest paid member of the cast despite his second billing.|$|E
5|$|Despite widely varying {{treatment}} (some {{groups were}} actively targeted for genocide, {{while others were}} not), some died in concentration camps such as Dachau and others from various forms of Nazi brutality. According to extensive documentation (written and photographic) left by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis,</b> eyewitness testimony by survivors, perpetrators and bystanders and records of the occupied countries, most perished in death camps such as Auschwitz-Birkenau.|$|E
5|$|During the {{war between}} June 1941 and January 1942, <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> killed an {{estimated}} 2.8 million Soviet prisoners of war. Many starved to death while being held in open-air pens at Auschwitz and elsewhere. The Soviet Union lost 27 million people {{during the war and}} less than nine million of these were combat deaths. One in four of the population were killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|Foreign workers {{brought into}} Germany {{were put into}} four {{different}} classifications: guest workers, military internees, civilian workers and Eastern workers. Different regulations were placed upon the worker depending on their classification. To separate Germans and foreign workers, <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> issued a ban on sexual relations between Germans and foreign workers.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Kellner was {{a justice}} {{inspector}} {{in the courthouse}} in Mainz between 1903 and 1933. From 1914 until 1918, {{he served as a}} soldier in the German army. When the First World War ended and Germany became a republic, Kellner became a political activist for the Social Democratic Party of Germany. For ten years, Kellner openly campaigned against <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> until they came to power in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Historian Thomas Vogel opines that Rommel {{was not a}} Nazi, if {{one uses}} the {{definition}} <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> themselves used, considering that although he did everything {{in his power to}} make his country strong again, he showed no support towards the racial policies or other aspects of the regime.|$|E
5|$|Héloïse Aue (Héloïse Moreau) – Max's mother, who, believing {{her first}} husband to be dead, {{remarried}} Aristide Moreau. Max does not accept that his father is dead and never forgives his mother for remarrying. Héloïse also disapproves of Max's joining <b>the</b> <b>Nazis,</b> which further strains their relationship.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Steve Rogers {{is deemed}} {{physically}} unfit to {{enlist in the}} U.S. Army and fight <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> in World War II. Recruited for a secret military operation, he is physically transformed into a super-soldier dubbed Captain America and must battle the Red Skull, head of a Nazi weaponry division known as Hydra.|$|E
5|$|In German-occupied Poland {{the task}} of rescuing Jews was {{especially}} difficult and dangerous. All household members were punished by death if a Jew was found concealed in their home or on their property. It is estimated {{that the number of}} Poles who were killed by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> for aiding Jews was as high as tens of thousands, 704 of whom were posthumously honored with medals.|$|E
5|$|In March 1933, the Enabling Act, an {{amendment}} to the Weimar Constitution, passed in the Reichstag by a vote of 444 to 94. This amendment allowed Hitler and his cabinet to pass laws—even laws that violated the constitution—without the consent of the president or the Reichstag. As the bill required a two-thirds majority to pass, <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to keep several Social Democratic deputies from attending, as the Communists had already been banned. On 10 May, the government seized the assets of the Social Democrats and they were banned in June. The remaining political parties were dissolved and on 14 July 1933 Germany became a de facto one-party state when the founding of new parties was made illegal. Further elections in November 1933, 1936 and 1938 were entirely Nazi-controlled and saw only <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> and a small number of independents elected. The regional state parliaments and the Reichsrat (federal upper house) were abolished in January 1934.|$|E
5|$|In Taking Sides (2001), Szabó {{returned}} to thematic territory he had explored in Mephisto. Stellan Skarsgård plays real life German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, and Harvey Keitel a U.S. Army investigator interrogating Furtwängler about his collaboration with <b>the</b> <b>Nazis.</b> The film won several awards at the Mar del Plata Film Festival in Argentina, including Best Director.|$|E
5|$|In late 2007 {{and early}} 2008, several Russian newspapers, {{including}} Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Komsomolskaya Pravda, and Nezavisimaya Gazeta printed stories that implicated <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> in the crime, spurring concern {{that this was}} done with the tacit approval of the Kremlin. As a result, the Polish Institute of National Remembrance decided to open its own investigation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of December, under bad weather conditions, <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> {{launched}} an offensive in the Ardennes. The Luftwaffe caught many squadrons off guard. No.410 Squadron enjoyed a number of successes during this period, some of them even on Christmas Day. During the Battle of the Bulge, the entire RAF Second Tactical Air Force, including No.410 Squadron, was on 48-hour alert.|$|E
