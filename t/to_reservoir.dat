5|$|In May 2010, WPD {{applied to}} the Environment Agency for a {{discharge}} licence in order to completely drain the reservoir, which was granted in July 2010. The issue was taken to UK Parliament by Jonathan Evans where he stated that an independent report by the Halcrow Group (advising for the Environment Agency) explained that draining the reservoir could create 'new risks <b>to</b> <b>reservoir</b> safety'. Evans' predecessor, Julie Morgan, had previously taken the issue of saving the reservoir site to parliament, and had garnered support from politicians such as Peter Hain (the Welsh Secretary) and Ed Miliband (later leader of the Labour Party), who visited the site during the May 2010 general election campaign, commenting on the site's tranquillity.|$|E
5|$|In the 1910s, several power {{companies}} built lines through the area. The General Pipe Line Company completed an oil pipeline connecting the San Joaquin Valley's Midway-Sunset Oil Field with the port at San Pedro in 1913. Its alignment followed the Ridge Route north of Gorman {{and south of}} Reservoir Summit, a longer distance {{than any of the}} earlier transportation routes, but from Gorman south to the present location of Pyramid Lake, where it turned east <b>to</b> <b>Reservoir</b> Summit, it roughly followed the later Ridge Route Alternate. That same year, the Midway Gas Company opened a natural gas line, and the Pacific Light and Power Company opened a power line, both staying fairly close to the entire Ridge Route.|$|E

25|$|In {{the event}} of a loss of braking due <b>to</b> <b>reservoir</b> depletion, the engine driver may be able to regain control with an {{emergency}} brake application, as the emergency portion of each car's dual-compartment reservoir should be fully chargedit is not affected by normal service reductions. The triple valves detect an emergency reduction based on the rate of brake pipe pressure reduction. Therefore, as long as a sufficient volume of air can be rapidly vented from the brake pipe, each car's triple valve will cause an emergency brake application. However, if the brake pipe pressure is too low due to an excessive number of brake applications, an emergency application will not produce a large enough volume of air flow to trip the triple valves, leaving the engine driver with no means to stop the train.|$|E
500|$|Healy Hall, {{designed}} by Paul J. Pelz in Neo-Medieval style and built from 1877 to 1879, is the architectural gem of Georgetown's campus, {{and is a}} National Historic Landmark. Within Healy Hall {{are a number of}} notable rooms including Gaston Hall, Riggs Library, and the Bioethics Library Hirst Reading Room. Both Healy Hall and the Georgetown University Astronomical Observatory, built in 1844, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In front of the Healy and Copley Hall buildings is the large front lawn area, which is crossed by walkways and paths that center on the statue of John Carroll. In addition to the front lawn, the main campus has traditionally centered on Dahlgren Quadrangle behind Healy Hall, which is home to Dahlgren Chapel; however, in recent decades, Red Square has replaced the Dahlgren Quadrangle as the focus of student life. North of Red Square is an extended pathway that is home to buildings such as the Intercultural Center (ICC), the Reiss Science building, the newly constructed dormitory named after Pedro Arrupe, S.J., and the large Leavey Student Center. The northern terminus of the undergraduate campus is marked by St. Mary's Hall adjacent <b>to</b> <b>Reservoir</b> Road, home to the School of Nursing and Health Sciences. Across Reservoir Road is the Burleith neighborhood, where some upperclassmen rent houses off-campus.|$|E

2500|$|Geomodelling is {{commonly}} used for managing natural resources, identifying natural hazards, and quantifying geological processes, with main applications to oil and gas fields, groundwater aquifers and ore deposits. [...] For example, in {{the oil and gas}} industry, realistic geologic models are required as input <b>to</b> <b>reservoir</b> simulator programs, which predict the behavior of the rocks under various hydrocarbon recovery scenarios. A reservoir can only be developed and produced once; therefore, making a mistake by selecting a site with poor conditions for development is tragic and wasteful. Using geological models and reservoir simulation allows reservoir engineers to identify which recovery options offer the safest and most economic, efficient, and effective development plan for a particular reservoir.|$|E

40|$|As a {{model for}} {{molecular}} traffic control (MTC) we investigate the diffusion of hard core particles in crossed single-file systems. We consider a square lattice of single-files being connected <b>to</b> external <b>reservoirs.</b> The (vertical) alpha-channels, carrying only A-particles, are connected <b>to</b> <b>reservoirs</b> with constant density ra. B-particles move along the (horizontal) beta-channels, which are connected <b>to</b> <b>reservoirs</b> of density rB. We allow the irreversible transition A to B at intersections. We {{are interested in the}} stationary density profile in the alpha- and beta- channels, which is the distribution of the occupation probabilities over the lattice. We calculate the stationary currents of the system and show that for sufficiently long channels the currents (as a function of the reservoir densities) show in the limit of large transition rates non analytic behavior. The results obtained by direct solution of the master equation are verified by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Comment: 11 page...|$|R
