5|$|The {{dromedary}} {{shares the}} genus Camelus with the Bactrian camel (C. bactrianus) {{and the wild}} Bactrian camel (C. ferus). The dromedary belongs to the family Camelidae. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (4th century BC) {{was the first to}} describe the species of Camelus. He named two species in his History of Animals; the one-humped Arabian camel and the two-humped Bactrian camel. The dromedary was given its current binomial name Camelus dromedarius by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 publication Systema Naturae. In 1927, British veterinarian Arnold Leese classified dromedaries by their basic habitats; the hill camels are small, muscular animals and efficient beasts of burden; the larger plains camels could be further divided into the desert type that can bear light burdens and are apt for riding, and the riverine type slow animals that can bear heavy burdens; and those intermediate between <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types.</b>|$|E

25|$|Freshwater swamp forests can be {{classified}} into two categories of forested wetlands, which are permanently and periodically flooded forests. It is possible to find <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> {{because of the high}} microtopographic variation.

25|$|A long {{standing}} assumption about Nietzsche {{is that he}} preferred master over slave morality. However, the Nietzsche scholar Walter Kaufmann rejected this interpretation, writing that Nietzsche's analyses of <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> of morality were only used in a descriptive and historic sense, they were not meant {{for any kind of}} acceptance or glorifications.|$|E
25|$|Within <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types,</b> {{there is}} still {{considerable}} variation, and even disagreements as to exactly how the stick is held in a particular method. For example, Jim Chapin, an early and influential exponent of the Moeller method, asserts that the technique does not rely on rebound, while Dave Weckl asserts that it does rely on rebound.|$|E
25|$|Levels of {{dopamine}} {{can be used}} {{to distinguish}} between <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types.</b> Tetrahydrobiopterin is required to convert Phe to Tyr and is required to convert Tyr to L-DOPA via the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. L-DOPA, in turn, is converted to dopamine. Low levels of dopamine lead to high levels of prolactin. By contrast, in classical PKU (without dihydrobiopterin involvement), prolactin levels would be relatively normal.|$|E

25|$|Wood's glass tubes {{manufactured}} by Osram use a fairly narrow-band emitting phosphor, europium activated strontium pyroborate with a peak at about 370nm, whereas North American and Philips Wood's glass tubes use lead-activated calcium metasilicate that emits a wider band with a shorter wavelength peak at about 350nm. <b>These</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> {{seem to be}} the most commonly used. Different manufacturers offer either one or the other and sometimes both.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{a review}} of {{existing}} studies found that, on average, 40% of GERD patients also had H. pylori infection. The eradication of H. pylori can lead to an increase in acid secretion, leading {{to the question of whether}} H. pylori-infected GERD patients are any different than non-infected GERD patients. A double-blind study, reported in 2004, found no clinically significant difference between <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> of patients with regard to the subjective or objective measures of disease severity.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scholars}} {{assert that}} there was no Liber (other than a god of wine) within historical memory. O. de Cazanove argues that the domain of the sovereign god Jupiter was that of sacred, sacrificial wine (vinum inferium), while that of Liber and Libera was confined to secular wine (vinum spurcum); <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> were obtained through differing fermentation processes. The offer of wine to Liber was made possible by naming the mustum (grape juice) stored in amphoras sacrima.|$|E

25|$|<b>These</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> have {{different}} characteristics, and may occur together. Axial CA occurs throughout {{the image and}} is specified by optical engineers, optometrists, and vision scientists in the unit of focus known widely as diopters, and is reduced by stopping down. (This increases depth of field, so though the different wavelengths focus at different distances, they are still in acceptable focus.) Transverse CA does not occur in the center, and increases towards the edge, but is not affected by stopping down.|$|E
25|$|The CMB {{spectrum}} {{can distinguish}} {{between these two}} because <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> of perturbations produce different peak locations. Isocurvature density perturbations produce a series of peaks whose angular scales (l values of the peaks) are roughly in the ratio 1:3:5:..., while adiabatic density perturbations produce peaks whose locations are in the ratio 1:2:3:... Observations {{are consistent with the}} primordial density perturbations being entirely adiabatic, providing key support for inflation, and ruling out many models of structure formation involving, for example, cosmic strings.|$|E
25|$|Glass aquaria {{have been}} a popular choice for many home and {{hobbyist}} aquarists for many years. Once silicone sealant became strong enough to ensure a long-term water-tight seal, it eliminated {{the need for a}} structural frame. In addition to lower cost, glass aquaria are more scratch resistant than acrylic. Although the price {{is one of the main}} considerations for aquarists when deciding which of <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> of aquaria to purchase, for very large tanks, the price difference tends to disappear.|$|E

25|$|Intersection {{types are}} types {{describing}} values {{that belong to}} both of two other given types with overlapping value sets. For example, in most implementations of C the signed char has range -128 to 127 and the unsigned char has range 0 to 255, so the intersection type of <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> would have range 0 to 127. Such an intersection type could be safely passed into functions expecting either signed or unsigned chars, because it is compatible with both types.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of HPV+OPC {{involves}} avoiding or reducing {{exposure to}} risk factors where possible. About 90% of HPV+OPC carry HPV 16, and another 5% type 18. <b>These</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> are both targets of available vaccines. HPV vaccines given {{prior to exposure}} can prevent persistent genital infection and the consequent precancerous state. Therefore, they have a theoretical potential to prevent oral HPV infection. A 2010 review study has found that HPV16 oral infection was rare (1.3%) among the 3,977 healthy subjects analyzed.|$|E
25|$|In addition, MSM {{focused on}} the use of natural {{medicine}}. Natural medicine seeks to combine the advantages of both traditional and modern medicine. Traditional medicine refers to the use of knowledge of the use of locally grown plants coupled with an understanding of the language and culture of local villages. Modern medicine refers to the use of drugs that are regulated and produced to a high standard. Through combining <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> of medicine, natural medicine seeks to develop a new culturally appropriate and cost effective health service.|$|E

25|$|In graph theory, {{a branch}} of mathematics, an {{indifference}} graph is an undirected graph constructed by assigning a real number to each vertex and connecting two vertices by an edge when their numbers are within one unit of each other. Indifference graphs are also the intersection graphs of sets of unit intervals, or of properly nested intervals (intervals none of which contains any other one). Based on <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> of interval representations, these graphs are also called unit interval graphs or proper interval graphs; they form a subclass of the interval graphs.|$|E
25|$|In {{the uniform}} matroid , every element is a loop (an element {{that does not}} belong to any {{independent}} set), and in the uniform matroid , every element is a coloop (an element that belongs to all bases). The direct sum of matroids of <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> is a partition matroid in which every element is a loop or a coloop; it is called a discrete matroid. An equivalent definition of a discrete matroid is a matroid in which every proper, non-empty subset of the ground set E is a separator.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{optimism}} bias occurs for both positive events, such as believing oneself {{to be more}} financially successful than others, and negative events, such as being {{less likely to have}} a drinking problem, there is more research and evidence suggesting that the bias is stronger for negative events. Different consequences result from <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> of events: positive events often lead to feelings of well being and self-esteem, while negative events lead to consequences involving more risk, such as engaging in risky behaviors and not taking precautionary measures for safety.|$|E
