5|$|A naval {{footnote}} in {{the history}} of Lundy was the wreck of the Royal Navy battleship HMS Montagu. Steaming in heavy fog, she ran hard aground near Shutter Rock on the island's southwest corner at about 2:00a.m. on 30 May 1906. Thinking they were aground at Hartland Point on the English mainland, a landing party went ashore for help, only finding out where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>after</b> encountering the lighthouse keeper at the island's north light.|$|E
5|$|Salim {{appears in}} Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He is voiced by TJ Ramini. After Drake defeats the henchmen {{in the desert}} ghost town, Salim comes to him on horseback and helps him escape. After Drake was rescued, Salim tells him that the Atlantis of the Sands is a {{dangerous}} place and that Marlowe cannot be allowed to enter because of the evil within. Drake believes that she could use these powers to control others through fear, realising it was not treasure <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>after.</b> When Sully is rescued, Salim brings both {{of them to the}} open desert where the Atlantis of the Sands is located. Salim heads off and gets separated from Drake and Sully because of the heavy sandstorm. After Talbot is defeated and the Atlantis of the Sands collapse, Salim appears in time to save them.|$|E
25|$|After several failed {{attempts}} at developing an official team-owned mascot, the Vikings finally introduced Viktor the Viking during the 2007 Vikings' season. Team officials had long indicated that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>after</b> a mascot concept that would primarily {{appeal to the}} team's younger fan base. Viktor the Viking, a muscle-bound, blond-haired and mustachioed character, wears a Vikings' #1 jersey and an oversized Vikings helmet with protruding horns and a small yellow nose guard. Due to contract disputes in 2015, the team lost its mascot Ragnar the Viking and still is without him for the 2017 season.|$|E

25|$|Keiron Self (2002–11) portrays Roger Bailey. Roger is the over-enthusiastic dentist {{who works}} in the same {{building}} as Ben. He often turns up at the Harper household uninvited and proceeds to unintentionally annoy Ben. For a long period Roger was trying to build up the courage to ask Abi out. <b>They</b> <b>were,</b> <b>after</b> all, ideally suited – like Abi, Roger possesses no common sense and is gullible. Eventually they did marry but have since split as Abi has decided to become a nun. He's now a part-time policeman as well a dentist.|$|E
25|$|The same {{reputation}} which Baxter {{had obtained}} in the country he secured in London. The power of his preaching was universally felt, and his capacity for business placed him {{at the head of}} his party. He had been made a king's chaplain, and was offered the Bishopric of Hereford, but he could not accept the offer without assenting to things as <b>they</b> <b>were.</b> <b>After</b> his refusal, he was not allowed, even before the passing of the Act of Uniformity, to be a curate in Kidderminster, and Bishop George Morley prohibited him from preaching in the Diocese of Worcester.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{handed down}} its {{decision}} in Canberra on 27 October 2017. It ruled unanimously that, under section 44(i), Joyce, Ludlam, Nash, Roberts and Waters had been ineligible to be elected, while Canavan and Xenophon had been eligible. The immediate outcome {{was that the}} government risks losing its one-seat majority in the House of Representatives {{if it does not}} win the required by-election and a number of Senate seats were temporarily vacant (affecting the party balance while <b>they</b> <b>were).</b> <b>After</b> countbacks, the High Court has approved successors from the same parties to Senators Ludlam, Waters and Roberts, but not yet to Nash.|$|E

25|$|Operators {{were unable}} to restart the {{isolation}} condensers {{for an extended period}} of time after the tsunami (greater than 30minutes). After that, the isolation condensers were operated intermittently, for unknown reasons. The isolation condensers were designed to successfully cool Unit 1 for at least 8hours, and it is unknown how effective <b>they</b> <b>were.</b> <b>After</b> that, refill would have been required to the isolation condenser tanks which are under atmospheric pressure (low pumping head requirements). By design, isolation condensers would have removed the heat from the reactor transferring it out of the primary containment and into the atmosphere, but with limited and non-existent operation, core and containment cooling was not successful.|$|E
25|$|The {{materials}} for baskets were sedge root, willow shoots and roots, bulrush or blackroot, redbud shoots, sometimes bracken fern {{and a variety}} of colorful bird feathers, abalone and other types of shells, magnesite beads and sometimes glass beads. Redbud shoots, used for the darker reddish colors in basket designs are gathered in October. Good redbud is hard to obtain around Ukiah, so it is usually found at Clear Lake. All these materials are gathered with a thankful heart and the gatherers talk continuously to the plants. <b>They</b> <b>were,</b> <b>after</b> all, living things that were giving themselves for something useful and beautiful. In order to preserve the soil and creek banks, sedge gathering was done with care. The commonly held decision would be leaving behind about half of what was found. Dyeing of the bulrush root takes about three to six months in a concoction of black walnuts, rusty metal and ashes in water.|$|E
25|$|On 21 January 1942, Jim Crawford {{enlisted in}} the Australian Army Medical Corps. Crawford wanted to enlist earlier {{but he had not}} been {{medically}} fit. When Crawford grew tired of peeling spuds he was discharged in September and worked as a stoker in the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, serving aboard mine-sweepers guarding the B.H.P steel works at Whyalla. While working as a stoker, Crawford founded a Worker's study group. Crawford also spoke at War Loan Rallies. At one rally he spoke on a platform with future Australian Prime Minister, Harold Holt, who shouted Crawford to a double whisky after his speech. Jim was charged with mutiny for organising to stop work of naval stokers until they were paid trade union rates. They stood firm and gained the Union rates <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>after,</b> however, Crawford was transferred to New Guinea to the Naval Depot HMS Ladava. In 1944, he experienced the bombing by the Japanese in New Guinea. He also served aboard an Icelandic fishing trawler converted to minesweeper HMS Beryl. While working on the minesweeper Crawford had to shovel coal into the furnace. This coal shovelling had caused permanent damage to Crawford's lungs and he developed emphysema. In January, 1945, he was discharged from the navy with a pension as he was suffering from a duodenal ulcer. Once discharged from the navy, he arrived back in Melbourne and wrote for large newspapers, such as the Sporting Globe and the Melbourne Guardian. He worked for the Melbourne Guardian for ten years, writing mostly about political issues.|$|E

500|$|Referring to the {{challenges}} faced in casting, he said that while they were canvassing local people for auditions, they were warding off rumors that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>after</b> the people's kidneys. When placing a newspaper advertisement for the landlady's character did not seem viable, they advertised for household help instead. Upon seeing this, Urmila Dammannagari turned up for the interview with Domalpalli. Inadvertently, their conversation veered toward the film and the real motive behind the advertisement became evident. Though initially shocked {{and despite the fact}} that she had to commute [...] from her house to the location, she took up the role. Professionally Krishnamma Gundimalla, who played the role of Radhamma, carried bricks on her head as a construction worker. On the other hand, Ramachandriah Marikanti, who plays Vanaja's fisherman father, was a municipal sweeper and worked as a security guard.|$|E
500|$|Byrne {{recorded}} all the tracks, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>after</b> Belew {{had performed}} on them, in a cassette {{and looked to}} Africa to break his writer's block. He realised that, when African musicians forget words, they often improvise and make new ones up. The lyricist used a portable tape recorder and tried to create onomatopoeic rhymes {{in the style of}} Eno, who believed that lyrics were never the center of a song's meaning. Byrne continuously listened to his recorded scatting until convinced that he was no longer [...] "hearing nonsense". After the frontman was satisfied, Harrison invited Nona Hendryx to Sigma Sound to record backing vocals for the album. She was advised extensively on her vocal delivery by Byrne, Frantz, and Weymouth, and often sang in a trio with Byrne and Eno. The voice sessions were followed by the overdubbing process. Brass player Jon Hassell, who had been working on parts of My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, was hired to perform trumpet and horn sections. In August 1980, half of the album was mixed by Eno and engineer John Potoker in New York City with the assistance of Harrison, while the other half was mixed by Byrne and Jerden at Eldorado Studios in Los Angeles.|$|E

She preferred to conduct all of her conversations in French so that others were unlikely to understand the discussion.|$|E

However, circles of the precipitate are smaller and less distinct during expansion than <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>after</b> expansion has ended. Further, temperature affects the rate of expansion, but {{does not affect the}} size of a circle at its end point.
