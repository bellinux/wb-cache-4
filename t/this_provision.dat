5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very {{different}} view of this legislation.

The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell's plan was left in place.

We show that as the number of participants becomes large there is a limiting problem, whose solution takes a simple form. For instance, it is near optimal to set a fixed fee and allow a participant to access the good if he is willing to pay this fee. The advantage of this is that the provisioning policy and fee structure can be easily communicated to the participants. 1 A problem of providing a public good This paper is about problems of provisioning a good amongst a number of participants who are able to communicate information about their private preferences for the good.

5|$|The {{possible}} inconsistencies {{the subjective}} test had {{with respect to}} Articles12 and 93 of the Constitution were sought to be resolved {{with the passing of}} the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989. Article149(1) was amended to shield any anti-subversion laws enacted pursuant to <b>this</b> <b>provision</b> from inconsistency with Articles11 and 12. This was in addition to Articles 9, 13 and 14 which had already been present in Article149(1) before the amendment. Furthermore, a new Article149(3) provided that nothing in Article93 would invalidate any provisions that were enacted pursuant to Article149. Hence, the ruling in Chng Suan Tze that the subjective test was inconsistent with the Constitution was legislatively reversed, and the subjective test was restored as the valid and relevant law in Singapore.|$|E

Begar, practised in the past by landlords, has been declared a crime and is punishable by law. Trafficking in humans for the purpose of slave trade or prostitution is also prohibited by law.

5|$|Articles 41–43 mandate the State to {{endeavour}} to secure to all citizens the right to work, a living wage, social security, maternity relief, and a decent standard of living. These provisions aim at establishing a socialist state as envisaged in the Preamble. Article 43 also places upon the State the responsibility of promoting cottage industries, {{and the federal government}} has, in furtherance of this, established several Boards for the promotion of khadi, handlooms etc., in coordination with the state governments. Article 39A requires the State to provide free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are available to all citizens irrespective of economic or other disabilities. Article 43A mandates the State to work towards securing the participation of workers in the management of industries. The State, under Article 46, is also mandated to promote the interests of and work for the economic uplift of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and protect them from discrimination and exploitation.

5|$|Before {{the final}} {{convention}} in 1792, a committee composed of Garrard, Ambrose Dudley, and Augustine Eastin {{reported to the}} Elkhorn Baptist Association in favor of forbidding slavery in the constitution then being drafted for the new state. Slavery was {{a major issue in}} the 1792 convention that finalized the document. Delegate David Rice, a Presbyterian minister, was the leading voice against the inclusion of slavery protections in the new constitution, while George Nicholas argued most strenuously in favor of them. Garrard encouraged his fellow ministers and Baptists to vote against its inclusion. The motion to delete Article 9 of the proposed document, which protected the rights of slave owners, failed by a vote of 1626. Each of the seven Christian ministers who served as delegates to the convention (including Garrard) voted in favor of deleting the article. Five Baptist laymen defied Garrard's instructions and voted to retain Article 9; their votes provided the necessary margin for its inclusion. Historian Lowell H. Harrison wrote that the anti-slavery votes of the ministers may have accounted for the adoption of a provision that forbade ministers from serving in the Kentucky General Assembly. Garrard and the other ministers apparently expressed no dissent against <b>this</b> <b>provision.</b>|$|E

Such careers were made even more attractive when, in 1962, the state courts declared that the salaries of state employees, the amounts of which were specified in the state constitution, could be adjusted for inflation. Combs demanded that state employees stick strictly to the rules governing their offices. In one instance, Combs ordered a state audit of Carter County superintendent Heman McGuire, who was known to use his office for political gain. While Combs {{did not have the}} authority to remove McGuire directly, the audit showed McGuire's misappropriation of funds and abuse of power.
