500|$|After {{their first}} couple of seasons in New York City, team {{ownership}} infrequently invested in new players. The ownership group of Farrell and Devery spent their money on personal pursuits such as gambling, leaving them with little to put into the team. New York's star player, Chase, consorted frequently with gamblers. Author Jim Reisler dubbed him [...] "the most crooked player to ever play the game" [...] because of reports that he took part in game fixing. The club also had difficulty drawing fans to Hilltop Park. Appel wrote that [...] "maybe <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> could say about the ballpark was that it never burned down." [...] By {{the end of the}} 1912 season, Farrell was searching for a site to build a new stadium on.|$|E
500|$|In October 2008, Daniel Handler {{said that}} [...] "a sequel {{does seem to}} be in the works. Paramount has had quite a few {{corporate}} shakeups, which has led to many a delay. Of course, many, many plans in Hollywood come to naught, but I'm assured that another film will be made. Someday. Perhaps." [...] In June 2009, Silberling confirmed he still talked about the project with Handler, and suggested the sequel be a stop motion film because the lead actors have grown too old. [...] "In an odd way, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> could do is actually have Lemony Snicket say to the audience, 'Okay, we pawned the first film off as a mere dramatization with actors. Now, I'm afraid I’m going to have to show you the real thing.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The BLT Cookbook {{discusses}} the author's {{love of the}} BLT sandwich, which according to Jordan is [...] "America's favorite sandwich". The author wrote, [...] "There are times when the BLT just tastes right, primal and true, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> could ever eat. The play of the salt and acid, the silk of the tomato against the salt crunch of the bacon ... It is sheer delight." [...] She discusses ways the combination {{can be used in}} soups, appetizers, and salads. Recipes are provided for multiple versions of the BLT sandwich. Jordan writes that to make the best sandwich, one should select the finest ingredients. She recommends shopping at farmers' markets for fresh tomatoes, a butcher for choice bacon, and a bakery for fresh bread. The author recommends mayonnaise brands Hellmann's and Best Foods, and Niman bacon from California. Jordan writes, [...] "For lettuce, remove the first outer leaf and then use only the next three layers. Further in, iceberg lettuce gets a little cabbagey." ...|$|E

500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} about the {{breakdown}} of a relationship between Beyoncé and her lover, a situation that suits both of them. They also touch on revenge and karma, particularly the opening line, [...] "What goes around comes back around", the lines [...] "Best thing I never had", [...] "Best thing you never had", and the closing line, [...] "Sucks to be you right now". Happy to have avoided heartbreak, Beyoncé continues to sing about her ex-lover, who did not recognize {{the possibility of a}} happy relationship with Beyoncé until the relationship broke down. Beyoncé no longer desires her lover after discovering his deceit; as shown in the pre-chorus and chorus lines, [...] "When I think of the time that I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you / Thank God you blew it, I thank God I dodged a bullet / I’m so over you, so baby good looking out / I wanted you bad / I’m so through with that / Because honestly / You {{turned out to be the}} best thing I never had / And will always be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> never had." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrea Magrath of Daily Mail {{compared}} Beyoncé with Maria von Trapp in the video. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine {{praised the}} video, [...] "What {{better way to}} show your ex they're <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> never had than with saying 'I Do' to someone bigger and better in a Baracci Beverly Hills wedding gown." [...] Jason Lipshutz of the same publication {{described it as a}} [...] "smile-inducing clip with a dream wedding". A writer of Rap-Up praised the video's [...] "fairytale" [...] ending. Gordon Smart of The Sun described the white corset that Beyoncé wore in the video as sexy and wrote that [...] "her ex will be feeling a bit of a mug watching it when he remembers what he's missing out on." [...] Ashleigh Rainbird of the Daily Mirror found Beyoncé, [...] "looking sexy in white lacy undies and garter – and later in a Big Fat Gypsy Wedding-style frock". Amos Barshad of New York magazine commented, [...] "To just full-on hammer down the whole 'mature and settled down and happy' thing, Mrs. Hova saunters around with the most irrepressible smile you've ever seen, shimmying amazingly (note the moves at 3:30) as home footage of that jerk she threw away like a parking ticket cuts in and out." [...] The music video peaked at number one on the UK TV Airplay Chart, logging 634 plays on July 24, 2011.|$|E
500|$|Chrissie left Den but was {{eventually}} convinced {{to give their}} marriage another try. Oberman revealed in the Daily Mail that she drew on a famous real-life model to reconcile the dichotomous behaviour of a strong woman taking back her cheating husband: [...] "I based Chrissie on Hillary: an intelligent, attractive woman who was publicly humiliated. People ask why she stays with that awful man. A lot of strong women are like that." [...] She also saw {{the ebb and flow}} of Den and Chrissie's marriage as a reflection of the mental gameplaying that was so prominent in their characterisations: [...] "I think there's a challenge in it, and I think she would like to be the one who would ultimately tame him." [...] As Den's equal, Chrissie was intended to be a challenge to his propensity for intellectual games, having already outwitted the show's prior , Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Den had seen little threat in his first wife's aptitude, but considered Chrissie to be [...] "as sharp as they come". Indeed, Den's extra-marital dalliances were used by writers to showcase and highlight Chrissie's [...] "strong-willed persona". When Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) chastised Den for caring only about Chrissie's reaction should she learn of their affair, Den fired back: [...] "And so should you. You think I've treated you badly? Well you don't have a clue what's going to happen if she ever finds out! <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> can do is keep your mouth shut." [...] By the time Chrissie left the Square, Oberman dryly observed that she had [...] "had more fights on EastEnders than most women have in their whole lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Musicians {{including}} Henry Rollins {{have given}} enormous praise to the compiled recordings, calling it [...] "even better than advertised ... Sonically, {{the album is}} one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> are likely to hear in all of your life. There are moments on SMiLE that are so astonishingly good you might find yourself just staring at your speakers in unguarded wonder, as I have." ...|$|R

500|$|Stakes was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews, although a few commentators felt that the miniseries did not meet expectations. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 applauded the miniseries, noting {{that it is an}} interesting meditation on the concept of change, as well as the on philosophical idea that everything is cyclical. In regards to the art and direction of the miniseries, Anders wrote: [...] "There is so much insane gorgeous imagery in this , including a ton of really fantastic dream sequences. This show is really pushing its limits in terms of pure visual artistry." [...] Anders noted that, while some fans of the show have been suffering from [...] "Adventure Time fatigue"—largely {{based on the belief that}} the show has not moved forward since Finn met his father—Stakes [...] "really feels like a rejoinder to the people who complain the show isn’t moving fast enough with its plots". Writing for Vox, Todd VanDerWerff wrote highly of the miniseries, arguing that it was an excellent example of the coming-of-age story that [...] "shows off the kids series' emotional maturity". He did note that the miniseries is [...] "less a cohesive whole than a bunch of short stories that feel as if they accidentally add up to something bigger", and that the need for every installment to exist as a self-contained unit made Stakes [...] "a little clunky". With that being said, he felt that it ended up being [...] "suitably epic" [...] and [...] "rich with metaphor". Ultimately, VanDerWerff felt that the moral message of the miniseries was: [...] "Change is good. Growth is good. Supporting others' growth is good. And accepting others when they need to change is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> can do." ...|$|E
2500|$|This game {{is often}} {{referred}} to as the [...] "dot-com" [...] Super Bowl since it was held during the height of the dot-com bubble, and several Internet companies purchased television commercials. E-Trade ran a commercial featuring a chimpanzee dancing in an E-Trade T-shirt and the text [...] "Well, we just wasted 2 million bucks." [...] Lifeminders.com ran a commercial of plain typewritten text beginning with the line [...] "This is the worst commercial on the Super Bowl. But it might be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> see tonight." [...] Pets.com famously paid millions for an advertisement featuring a sock puppet, though the company would collapse before the end of the year.|$|E
2500|$|... "Face in the Sand" [...] {{is based}} on the media {{coverage}} surrounding the Iraq War, taking place as the album was being recorded. Dickinson explains, [...] "I remember thinking about the desert sands as an image and how it moves and shifts with time. Specifically what I was thinking was that whatever empires you tend to build – whether they are British, American, Iraqi or whatever, they'll all crumble and fade away into something else. So, to my mind at least, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> can hope for, if you were to leave anything behind, is just an imprint in the sand." [...] The song is notable for being the first and only Iron Maiden track in which McBrain uses a double bass pedal.|$|E

2500|$|Including {{the butt}} fumble, Sanchez lost the ball 24 {{times in the}} 2011 and 2012 seasons. In 2013, the Jets' new quarterbacks coach, David Lee, instituted a program {{to cut down on}} the fumbles by {{teaching}} Sanchez to hold the ball with both hands. In what Lee calls [...] "The Sanchez Drill," [...] the quarterback runs a gauntlet of people trying to knock the ball out of his hands with foam bats. Lee explained to the press, [...] "Mark can win in this league. He has proven that. He’s played for championships. I'm blatantly honest, brutally truthful at times. I told him, 'Hey, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> can do to help our football team—the No.1 thing—is take care of the ball.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{the editors}} had a {{difficult}} time finding someone to write the series, with Tim Hunter proving a tricky character to get right: although he already appeared in a mini-series, the character's main function had been to bear witness to the past, present and future of magic in the DC universe and so did not offer a writer much detail to work with. [...] Karen Berger eventually settled on writer John Ney Rieber to continue Tim's story, who expanded Tim's character using his own memories of being fourteen, later saying, [...] "I don't believe that my soul is likely to be shuffled off to Purgatory after I die. [...] What would be the point? I've been fourteen already." [...] Rieber utilized his own teenage confusion and delight in writing Tim, while introducing his first girlfriend Molly as a counterpoint: Molly was the opposite of Tim in nearly every way, someone [...] "who'd already figured out <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> could possibly do with your life was live it." ...|$|E
2500|$|To further promote [...] "A.K.A.", Lopez shot teaser videos {{for some}} tracks of the album. The first was [...] "Emotions", {{followed}} by [...] "Worry No More" [...] and [...] "Booty". For the video, the singer wore printed leggings and a cherry-colored crop {{top with a}} snapback hat, transitioning into sequin booty shorts and a matching crop top. The one-minute teaser clip for [...] "Booty" [...] sees Lopez {{and a group of}} backup dancers in patterned tights twerking form against an industrial backdrop. Zayda Rivera of New York Daily News further explained the storyline: [...] "Her voluptuous backside takes center stage in the music video as Lopez displays her own take on the dancing craze while instructing other women on just how to move it." [...] Rivera also commented that the video [...] "quickly confirmed why she's dominated dance in pop music since her big break as a Fly Girl on the hit ’90s sketch comedy series 'In Living Color'." [...] Alex Heigl of People agreed, stating: [...] "This is not some new-to-the-twerking-game rookie. This is how it's done. We hope you're ready." [...] Rachel McRady of US Magazine declared that Lopez [...] "reclaimed her title of most diva-licious derriere in the new teaser video for her upcoming single 'Booty'." [...] Mike Wass of Idolator called the video's visual [...] "hands-down <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> will watch today. Or ever." ...|$|E

2500|$|I Love You, Man is {{the third}} {{collaboration}} between Paul Rudd and Jason Segel, following the Judd Apatow projects Knocked Up and Forgetting Sarah Marshall, while writer/director John Hamburg previously worked with Segel on Apatow's Undeclared television series.

[...] On February 13, 2008 it was announced that Rashida Jones would be in the female lead opposite Rudd. [...] Later, in an interview with firstshowing.net, Jones revealed that because Segel and Rudd were already attached to the project she [...] "knew immediately that it was gonna be even funnier than I would think." [...] At the beginning of the March 31, 2008 week, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Jaime Pressly had joined the film's cast, playing the best friend of Rashida Jones' character. [...] Hamburg comically stated that he was lucky in casting J.K. Simmons because his contract states [...] "he has to be in {{one out of every four}} movies made." [...] Jon Favreau started working on the film the same week Iron Man came out, a film which he directed. He said he [...] "probably wouldn't have agreed to have done it had I known my life was going to be that shape", but Iron Man star Robert Downey, Jr. told him that [...] "It is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> could do" [...] he said 'chop wood, carry water,' which is what they do in the Kung Fu movies to keep you humble." ...|$|E
