25|$|The famous Sioux leader Sitting Bull is {{connected}} to Willow Bunch through his relationship with Jean-Louis Légaré. Sitting Bull led the Sioux and the Cheyenne in the Battle of Little Bighorn against General Custer and the 7th Cavalry Regiment. After the battle, the Sioux retreated to Saskatchewan, settling in the Wood Mountain area. The first group of Sioux was sent as a scouting party. They crossed the border along Frenchman river below the present villages of Val Marie and Mankota. They arrived at Jean-Louis Légaré’s trading-post on November 17, 1876. “I was in my store with <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> men, when a dozen savages on horseback appeared.” They told Légaré they needed supplies and came to “sleep in peace.” Légaré gave them $30 in goods and they went away. The next day, they came back with seventy lodges and camped.|$|E

And I just had such a great experience that I wanted to take something from that experience. The number 18, in Judaism, it means 'chai'... and it's the symbol for life and good fortune in Judaism.

Livingstone's statements were criticised by historians, among them Roger Moorhouse, who said that they were historically inaccurate. However political scientist Norman Finkelstein said that whilst [...] "Livingstone maybe wasn’t precise enough, and lacked nuance", his comments did reflect an initial ambivalence on the part of Hitler towards Zionism. Following Livingstone's remarks about Hitler which prompted accusations of antisemitism, he allegedly told an audience at an event that [...] "It’s absurd to call me an anti-Semite, as <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> ex-girlfriends are Jewish. It’s offensive to them to say they were lying in bed next to someone who hates them." [...] Similarly, the accusations made him question whether he has Jewish ancestry on his mother's side.|$|E

500|$|Having {{been drawn}} to face Gillingham {{in the first round}} of the League Cup, the club's manager, Paul Sturrock, planned to make a couple of changes to the team that faced Crystal Palace on the opening day of the new season, with youngster Joe Mason {{included}} in the squad. Two first-half goals were enough to take the hosts into the second round. Simeon Jackson put Gillingham ahead after 42 minutes and Andy Barcham scored a second just before the half-time break. Argyle reduced the deficit four minutes into the second-half when Luke Summerfield from a direct free kick, but they couldn't find an equaliser. The visitors should have forced extra time but Jamie Mackie spurned a chance when he pulled his shot wide with only the goalkeeper to beat. The defeat extended Sturrock's unfortunate run in the League Cup as a manager, having won just once in nine attempts. [...] "I must have the worst record of all managers in cup competitions, it's unbelievable," [...] he said. [...] "One or <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> defenders didn't defend properly tonight.

Groban released a statement, saying: [...] "I am honored to sing this beautiful new song by <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> absolute favorites, Alan Menken and Tim Rice. Beauty and the Beast has been with me since my childhood and to have a musical connection to this new film makes me so happy." [...] The announcement coincided with the studio's release of a new promotional poster for the film, which Disney allowed the singer to premiere using his official Twitter account. A 30-second sample of the track was uploaded to SoundCloud on February 14, 2017, which Groban also shared on Twitter. Groban's version was released as the second single from Beauty and the Beasts soundtrack on March 3, 2017, several days before the album, on which Stevens' original rendition appears, was released.

The occasion marked both the song's first televised performance, as well as the first time an original song from the remake was performed live on television.|$|E
500|$|Nirvana {{ultimately}} chose Albini {{to record}} its third album. [...] Albini {{had a reputation}} as a principled and opinionated individual in the American independent music scene. [...] While there was speculation that the band chose Albini to record the album due to his underground credentials, Cobain told Request magazine in 1993, [...] "For the most part I wanted to work with him because he happened to produce <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite records, which were Surfer Rosa [...] and Pod [...]" [...] Inspired by those albums, Cobain wanted to utilize Albini's technique of capturing the natural ambiance of a room via the usage and placement of several microphones, something previous Nirvana producers had been averse to trying. [...] Months before the trio had even approached Albini about the recording, rumors circulated that he was slated to record the album. [...] Albini sent a disclaimer to the British music press denying involvement, only to get a call from Nirvana's management a few days later about the project. [...] Although he considered the group to be [...] "R.E.M. with a fuzzbox" [...] and [...] "an unremarkable version of the Seattle sound", Albini told Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad he accepted because he felt sorry for the band members, whom he perceived to be [...] "the same sort of people as all the small-fry bands I deal with", at the mercy of their record company. [...] Before the start of recording sessions, the band sent Albini a tape of the demos it had made in Brazil. [...] In return, Albini sent Cobain a copy of the PJ Harvey album Rid of Me to give him an idea of the acoustics at the studio where they would record.|$|E
