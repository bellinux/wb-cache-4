5|$|Brown's {{second year}} as coach {{was the best}} in Stanford rugby history: the team was undefeated {{entering}} the Big Game at California, who was also undefeated. A record crowd of 26,000 turned out to see Stanford defeat the Bears, 26–8. This {{would be the last}} Big Game for several years as California returned to football for the 1915 season. Despite Stanford's success in rugby, the previous year's humiliating defeats to the All Blacks and the switch by rivals USC and California to football intensified the sentiment for Stanford <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{new sound}} chip and MIDI out {{abilities}} {{were exposed to}} the BASIC programming language with the command PLAY and a new command SPECTRUM was added to switch the machine into 48K mode, keeping the current BASIC program intact (although there is no way <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> to 128K mode). To enable BASIC programmers to access the additional memory, a RAM disk was created where files could be stored in the additional 80KB of RAM. The new commands took the place of two existing user-defined-character spaces causing compatibility problems with certain BASIC programs.|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle Remastered {{retains its}} {{two-dimensional}} cartoon-style art, redrawn at higher resolution for modern computers. The high resolution character art was updated {{by a team}} led by Yujin Keim with consultation of Ahern and Chan. Keim's team used many of the original sketches of characters and assets from the two and emulated their style with improvements for modern graphics systems. Matt Hanson worked on recreating the background assets in high resolution. As with the Grim Fandango remaster, the player can switch {{back and forth between the}} original graphics and the high-resolution version. The game includes a more streamlined interaction menu, a command wheel akin to the approach used in Broken Age, but the player can opt <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> to the original interface. The game's soundtrack has been redone within MIDI adapted to work with the iMUSE system. There is an option to listen to commentary from the original creators, including Schafer, Grossman, Chan, McConnell, Ahern, and Bajakian. The remaster contains the fully playable version of the original Maniac Mansion, though no enhancements have been made to that game-within-a-game.|$|E

50|$|Having progressed through Celtic's youth system, Mulgrew turned {{professional}} in July 2002. Originally playing at centre back, {{he was soon}} encouraged <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> left <b>back</b> due to the shortage of left backs at the club.|$|R
5|$|Double Fine {{demonstrated}} an in-progress {{version of the}} remastered game at the 2014 IndieCade event in October 2014; new features included higher-resolution textures and improved resolution for the character models as well as having real-time lighting models, and the ability <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> and forth between this presentation and the original graphics {{at the touch of}} a control. The remastered game runs in 4:3 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 16:9 ratio rather than render in a native 16:9 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaff's patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank-like controls, including analogue controls for console versions and point-and-click controls for computer versions. The game's soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fine's Broken Age). The remastered version also includes developer commentary, which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game. The PlayStation version also features cloud saving between the PS4 and Vita versions.|$|E
5|$|Initially, BioWare {{denied that}} a PlayStation 3 version {{was in the}} works. Despite this, it was {{reported}} that the Microsoft Windows version of the game featured lines of code referencing the PlayStation 3. BioWare responded that the Unreal Engine 3 is a cross-platform, which is the reason why it includes PlayStation 3 code. Eventually, a PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2 was released a year later than the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 versions of the game. The PlayStation 3 version uses {{a modified version of the}} Unreal Engine 3 called Mass Effect 3 engine; the same engine BioWare used for the then-upcoming Mass Effect 3. In this newer version, character models were slightly improved and controls were updated to support the PlayStation 3 controller. An option which allowed <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> to the Xbox 360 controls layout was also added.|$|E
5|$|In the fourth-season premiere, Ross and Rachel briefly {{reconcile}} after Ross {{pretends to}} read a long letter that Rachel wrote for him, but continues {{to insist that the}} two were on a break so they break up again. Joey dates Kathy (Paget Brewster), a girl that Chandler has a crush on. Kathy and Chandler later kiss, which causes drama between Chandler and Joey. Joey forgives Chandler only after he spends a day in a box as punishment. Phoebe becomes a surrogate mother for her brother and his wife Alice (Debra Jo Rupp). Monica and Rachel are forced to switch apartments with Joey and Chandler after losing a bet during a quiz game, but manage <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> by bribing them with Knicks season tickets and a one-minute kiss (off-screen) between the girls. Ross begins dating an English woman named Emily (Helen Baxendale), and the season finale features their wedding in London. Chandler and Monica sleep together, and Rachel decides to attend Ross and Emily's wedding. While saying his vows, Ross uses the wrong name at the altar (Rachel's), to the shock of his bride and the guests.|$|E
50|$|Turklish {{speakers}} {{borrow a}} considerable amount of their vocabulary from English while speaking Turkish, and vice versa. It is not uncommon for a speaker of Turklish <b>to</b> frequently <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> and forth between the two languages, sometimes mid-sentence.|$|R
50|$|On January 16, 1998, it <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> KOZN, and <b>switched</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the current}} KKYS {{later on the}} same day. The station has been HOT AC since the late nineties.|$|R
50|$|By {{investing}} $250,000 for new encoders and a multiplexer, Idaho Public Television plans <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> Plus <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{high definition}} in July 2017. The new equipment will allow running two HD channels and three SD widescreen channels, {{one of which}} will be PBS Kids.|$|R
5|$|The {{race was}} resumed on lap 13 and Button, who had changed to {{intermediate}} tyres before the safety car period, {{was given a}} drive-through penalty for speeding behind the safety car, emerging in 15th place. Vettel began to enlarge his lead over Alonso and Massa in second and third. Alonso and the Mercedes pitted for intermediate tyres, leaving Massa in second and Kobayashi in third by lap 17. Barrichello, who switched for intermediates as the safety car came in, began setting times at the same pace as the leaders, and gained 15th position as the drivers in front changed tyres. On lap 19, a rain storm arrived at the circuit, forcing the drivers on intermediate tyres <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> to full wets. Alonso and Button, who were in fifth and eighth respectively, fell to ninth and eleventh, while the drivers on the full wet tyres began pitting for fresh wet tyres. The safety car was brought out on lap 20 due to {{the intensity of the}} rain, and Vettel, Webber, Massa and Buemi, who had not changed tyres, went to the pitlane for fresh full wets. After six laps under the safety car, the conditions were getting worse, and the race was suspended.|$|E

25|$|Although Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 {{introduced}} {{a new version of}} Start menu, they offered the ability <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> to this version of Start menu. This version of the Start menu is also available in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. However, it is absent in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and other later Windows releases.|$|E
50|$|On July 6, 1993, the AM station {{changed its}} call sign from WCMR <b>to</b> WFRN. It <b>switched</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> WCMR in 2009. WCMR offers a {{southern}} gospel music format.|$|R
50|$|Collarini had {{represented}} Argentina in {{the early}} days of his career from 2007 to 2010, until he chose to represent USA from 2010 <b>to</b> 2012 before <b>switching</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> represent Argentina.|$|R
2500|$|During the approach, at 5400 meters, {{the course}} mode of the {{autopilot}} disconnected due to radio altimeter failure, but the pilots did not notify ATC about this. They have repeatedly tried <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> it <b>back</b> on, with [...] "increasing nervousness" [...] and cursing. When crossing 4200 meters, the {{flight control computer}} failed too.|$|R
25|$|The {{monitoring}} device switches off {{the transmitter}} when the antenna shows incorrect behavior, e.g. {{as a result}} of undesired electrical charge. When the transmitter is switched off, these charges dissipate. The monitoring device makes several attempts <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> on. If after several attempts the antenna continues to show improper behavior, possibly as result of structural damage, the transmitter remains switched off.|$|E
25|$|The Greek growers, in contrast, didn't let any Jewish merchants {{visit their}} {{orchards}} to inspect their trees, and only sold etrogs on Corfu. This forced many Satmars <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> {{to the traditional}} Yanova citron, even not bearing a pitam. The cultivation of the Greek citron was thereafter on concentrated in Halki, Naxos {{where there is a}} small production for distillery.|$|E
25|$|When {{the time}} {{traveling}} mutant Trevor Fitzroy unleashes the mutant-hunting robots called the Sentinels on Frost and her Hellions, Frost places {{herself in a}} psychic coma {{in order to survive}} the ordeal. Her students however, are not as lucky and are killed in action. Frost later awakens in the Xavier Academy. Disoriented, she switches minds with Iceman and escapes but is overcome with grief when she discovers the deaths of her students. Professor Xavier is able to coax Frost <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
25|$|Upon {{returning}} from overseas, pressure from society, their family, {{their peers and}} themselves force returnee children <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> channels <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the L1 and they quickly make effort to attain the level of native-like L1 proficiency of their peers. At the same time, lack of L2 support in the schools in particular and in society in general results in an overall L2 loss.|$|R

50|$|In {{defense of}} the project, its senior {{environmental}} advisor, Daniel Pagan Rosa, stated that the pipeline's safety system will be more sophisticated than those traditionally built in the United States. He added {{that there will be}} two monitoring centers, one in Ponce, and one in San Juan's Monancillo area. He also maintained that the system will be built <b>to</b> permit <b>switching</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> petroleum should a major disaster affect the pipeline.|$|R
25|$|The Russian {{conquest of}} Transcaucasia in the 19th century split the Azerbaijani {{language}} community across two states, the other being Iran. The Soviet Union promoted {{development of the}} language, but set it back considerably with two successive script changes – from the Persian to Latin {{and then to the}} Cyrillic script – while Iranian Azerbaijanis continued to use the Persian as they always had. Despite the wide use of Azerbaijani in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, it did not become the official language of Azerbaijan until 1956. After achieving independence from the Soviet Union 1991, the new Republic of Azerbaijan decided <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> to the Latin script.|$|E
25|$|WFAA (AM), {{which would}} {{eventually}} {{serve as the}} sister radio station to WFAA television, first signed on the air on June 26, 1922. The station had long participated in a time-sharing arrangement with Fort Worth radio station WBAP, which was maintained as the latter operated at various frequencies; it originally began in 1922, when WBAP (which first {{went on the air}} on May 2 of that year, nine weeks before WFAA began operations) transmitted at 630kHz and continued until 1927, before resuming when that station moved to 800kHz in 1929 and settling when WBAP moved its current frequency at 820kHz in 1941. In 1947, WFAA and WBAP began time-sharing on a second frequency, 570kHz, which was formerly occupied by KGKO. Until WFAA (AM) began to transmit full-time on 570kHz in 1970, WBAP and WFAA were engaged in the somewhat bizarre situation of having <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> and forth between the 570 and 820 frequencies at various times of the day: WBAP broadcast on 820 AM from midnight to 6:00a.m., with WFAA taking over the frequency space until noon; WBAP returned to the 820 signal for a few hours, before WFAA once again took over the frequency. WFAA had control over 820 during prime evening hours, when the 50,000-watt clear channel signal could often be heard as far west as California and as far east as New York (at the time, there were significantly fewer radio stations that were operating at night, reducing the likelihood of interference).|$|E
500|$|During the investigations, {{the player}} {{controls}} Edgeworth directly; they search {{the crime scene}} for evidence, and talk to witnesses to learn new information. As the player investigates, observed information is saved as Edgeworth's thoughts; by combining these, the player can obtain further information that would otherwise remain hidden. At some points, the player can use a device called [...] "Little Thief" [...] to generate hologram reproductions {{of the crime scene}} using known information about it; the player can walk around in the recreations and point out inconsistencies with the evidence, and update the recreation accordingly. Sometimes the player is able <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> and forth between recreations of the crime scene at two different times.|$|E
50|$|The {{show was}} {{broadcast}} from 10:30 p.m. <b>to</b> 12:00 midnight, <b>switching</b> <b>back</b> {{and forth from}} host Bob Hope on the West Coast to Conrad Nagel on the East Coast. The late start was made to accommodate those nominees who were performing that night on the Broadway stage.|$|R
50|$|Recuperators {{have also}} been used to recover heat from waste gasses to preheat {{combustion}} air and fuel for many years by metallic recuperators to reduce energy costs and carbon footprint of operation. Compared to alternatives such as regenerative furnaces, initial costs are lesser, there are no valves <b>to</b> be <b>switching</b> <b>back</b> and forth, there are no induced-draft fans {{and it does not}} require a web of gas ducts spread up all over the furnace.|$|R
5000|$|Skin and Bones (1933). A photographer's freak {{accident}} in the dark room produces a chemical concoction causing him (and his dog) <b>to</b> randomly <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> and forth between normal and X-ray (skeleton) versions of themselves. Predictably, much drinking and cavorting ensues, as he finds people able to see beyond his appearance and appreciate him for who he is, while inadvertently terrifying those who can not. Unusually, his wife Lorna is an attractive personality.|$|R
500|$|Bi-fuel {{vehicles}}. The term flexible-fuel vehicles {{is sometimes}} used to include other alternative fuel vehicles that can run with {{compressed natural gas}} (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG; also known as autogas), or hydrogen. However, all these vehicles actually are bi-fuel and not flexible-fuel vehicles, because they have engines that store the other fuel in a separate tank, and the engine runs on one fuel at a time. Bi-fuel vehicles have the capability <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> and forth from gasoline to the other fuel, manually or automatically. The most common available fuel {{in the market for}} bi-fuel cars is natural gas (CNG), and by 2008 there were 9,6 million natural gas vehicles, led by Pakistan (2.0 million), Argentina (1.7 million), and Brazil (1.6 million). [...] Natural gas vehicles are a popular choice as taxicabs in the main cities of Argentina and Brazil. Normally, standard gasoline vehicles are retrofitted in specialized shops, which involve installing the gas cylinder in the trunk and the CNG injection system and electronics.|$|E
500|$|The HTC First was {{released}} to mixed reviews. Dieter Bohn of The Verge gave the HTC First a 7.9 out of 10, receiving high marks in most categories except for its camera. Its design {{was considered to}} have a comfortable size and shape by contrast to larger flagship Android phones, and a display that was noted for its high resolution, good color reproduction and [...] "ridiculous" [...] viewing angles (but still being hard to use in direct sunlight). The First's camera {{was considered to be}} better than expected for a low-end phone, but produced [...] "muddy" [...] photos and [...] " [...] like a throwback to an earlier age when smartphones were nigh-useless in the dark." [...] Facebook Home's functionality was considered to be good for casual users, but the ability <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> to a stock Android 4.1 interface was considered [...] "stunning" [...] and a good compromise for the lack of Nexus devices with LTE support at the time.|$|E
500|$|The VR Disc {{was also}} {{released}} in the PAL region as a [...] "data disc" [...] titled Metal Gear Solid: Special Missions on October 29, 1999. Unlike the Japanese and American versions, Special Missions requires a PAL copy of the original Metal Gear Solid {{in order to be}} played. This change was done since the original Metal Gear Solid was released in multiple languages in Europe and Special Missions determines the language it uses based on which version of the original game the player owns. When the Special Missions disc is loaded into the PlayStation console, the game will ask the player to switch the disc with the first disc from Metal Gear Solid in order to load voice and language data before asking the player <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>back</b> to the Special Missions disc to start the game. This requirement renders Special Missions incompatible with PlayStation 2 consoles made prior to the SCPH-70000 model.|$|E
