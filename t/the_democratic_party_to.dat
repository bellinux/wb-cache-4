5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{same-sex}} marriage license controversy, Davis {{said she and}} her husband switched from <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> the Republican Party. While speaking with reporters, Davis expressed confidence in the way marriage licenses were now being issued by her office in Morehead, Kentucky. However, Davis warned that should the current situation become an issue, she was prepared to return to jail.|$|E
5|$|While coach, he was {{recruited}} by some in <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> {{run for the}} United States Senate against incumbent Jesse Helms. He declined. But in retirement, he continued to speak out {{on issues such as}} the war in Iraq, death penalty and gay rights. Although a staunch Democrat, Smith did support one of his former players, Richard Vinroot, a Republican who ran for governor of North Carolina in 2000. In 2006, Smith became the spokesperson for Devout Democrats, an inter-faith, grassroots political action committee designed to convince religious Americans to vote for Democrats. Smith was featured in an ad that ran in newspapers across North Carolina and was featured in an Associated Press article. On October 13, 2008, he endorsed Senator Barack Obama's candidacy for President of the United States.|$|E

50|$|Under Bjarne Kallis's chairmanship, the European MP Eija-Riitta Korhola {{changed from}} the Liberal group (ELDR) to the National parties' group (EPP). Later, Korhola also changed her Finnish party {{membership}} from <b>the</b> Christian <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> National Coalition Party, which caused <b>the</b> Christian <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> lose their only member position in the European Parliament.|$|R
5|$|During the Weimar Republic, the black-red-gold colours {{were the}} colours of <b>the</b> <b>democratic,</b> centrist, and republican {{political}} parties, {{as seen in}} the name of Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, formed by members of <b>the</b> Social <b>Democratic,</b> <b>the</b> Centre, and <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> defend <b>the</b> republic against extremists on the right and left.|$|R
25|$|After {{the end of}} the Puget Sound Indian War, Judson {{witnessed}} the execution of Chief Leschi (the war's instigator), which she deeply opposed, feeling he had been deceived into starting the rebellion. That same year, in 1858, Holden was elected by <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> the Washington State Legislature. The Judsons temporarily moved in with George and Trecia Corliss (who lived in Olympia) while the legislature was in session.|$|E
25|$|Heston {{opposed the}} Vietnam War during its course (though {{he changed his}} opinion in the years {{following}} the war) and in 1969 was approached by <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> run for the U.S. Senate against incumbent George Murphy. He agonized over the decision but ultimately determined he could never give up acting. He is reported to have voted for Richard Nixon in 1972, though Nixon is not mentioned in his autobiography.|$|E
25|$|After Dean became Chairman of the DNC, {{he pledged}} to bring reform to the Party. Rather than {{focusing}} just on swing states, Dean proposed {{what has come}} to be known as the 50-State Strategy, the goal of which was for <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> be committed to winning elections at every level in every region of the country, with Democrats organized in every single voting precinct. State party chairs lauded Dean for raising money directly for the individual state parties.|$|E

25|$|Brown {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for knowing what was occurring {{in the state legislature}} at all times. In 1992, he gave US$1.18 million to <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> help with voter registration and several campaigns, some of which was from contributions from tobacco companies and insurance companies. As Speaker, he worked to defeat the Three Strikes Law. Critics have claimed Brown did not do enough to raise the legislature’s ethical standards or to protect the environment. During his time in Sacramento, Brown estimates he raised close to US$75 million to help elect and reelect state Democrats.|$|E
25|$|By 1900 the Dallas {{population}} reached 38,000 as {{banking and}} insurance became major {{activities in the}} increasingly white-collar city, which was now the world's leading cotton center. It was also the world's center of harness making and leather goods. Businessmen took control of civic affairs; with little municipal patronage, {{there was only a}} small role for <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> play. The predominantly black Republican Party was essentially closed out of politics by the disenfranchisement in 1901 of most blacks through imposition of a poll tax (see below).|$|E
25|$|In early 2014, {{after losing}} the {{internal}} reelections in <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> Dragan Đilas Tadić resigned from his position of honorary president and left the party. Subsequently, a number of prominent party members all across defected from the party and stated that they intend to form a list in the forthcoming parliamentary election with Tadić as its leader. So far, coalition has been agreed with the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina. A political party, most likely named New Democratic Party, {{is in the process}} of forming and registration.|$|E

25|$|Hall {{served in}} the Delaware Senate during the 1867/68 session and the 1869/70 session. In 1874 he was nearly {{nominated}} for Governor, but it was New Castle County’s turn in the informal rotation. Finally, in 1878 he was elected Governor of Delaware, overwhelmingly defeating Kensey J. Steward, the Greenback Labor candidate. Leftover bitterness from the Civil War caused <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> be so completely in control that the Republican Party did not even hold a convention or field a candidate. Hall served from January 21, 1879 until January 16, 1883.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of Italian immigration, Boston Italians tended to vote Democratic. The one major {{exception}} was in 1920, when, disappointed that Wilson had not supported Italy's claim to the seaport city of Fiume, they voted for Harding. From 1920 to 1940 they voted consistently, overwhelmingly, Democratic. In 1924, Democratic candidates for Congress and the Massachusetts senate received about 90% of the Italian vote. During this period there was a massive push by <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>party</b> <b>to</b> mobilize new voters. Between 1924 and 1940, the number of male voters in the North End tripled, and the number of female voters increased eightfold.|$|E
25|$|Hainkel {{graduated}} in 1956 from the Roman Catholic De La Salle High School and then Tulane University and Tulane University School of Law, all in New Orleans. In {{addition to being}} known as a raconteur, Hainkel was a trial and appellate attorney. In 1967, he was the third partner in Porteous, Toledano, Hainkel, and Johnson, then the second oldest law firm in Louisiana specializing throughout its history in insurance defense. Law partner Ben Toledano, like Hainkel, left <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> run in his case, unsuccessfully, as a Republican for mayor of New Orleans in 1970 and the United States Senate in 1972.|$|E

25|$|McGreevey's {{decision}} {{to delay the}} effective date of his resignation until after September 3, 2004, avoided a special election in November to replace the governor. Doing so allowed <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> retain control of the governorship for the rest (until January 2006) of the 4-year term. It avoided {{the prospect of a}} special election in tandem with the presidential election, which could have resulted in a Republican victory and helped George W. Bush capture New Jersey's electoral votes. Bush did not win New Jersey's electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election, but captured 46% of the statewide vote, compared to 40% in the 2000 race, and did win re-election.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 US presidential {{campaign}} {{had a huge}} presence on social networking sites. Barack Obama, a virtually unknown Democratic candidate, utilized 15 different social media websites to form relationships with the millions of American citizens who utilize those networks. His social networking profile pages were constantly being updated and interacting with followers. By {{the end of his}} campaign, Obama had 5 million social media network supporters (2.5 million on Facebook and 115,000 on Twitter). The use of social networking sites in his marketing campaign gave Barack Obama's campaign access to e-mail addresses, as posted on social network profile pages. This allowed <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> launch e-mail campaigns asking for votes and campaign donations.|$|E
25|$|In 1893 {{he refused}} to grant the state Democrats {{permission}} to use the state's ceremonial cannon to fire a salute in celebration of Grover Cleveland's inauguration as President. (Pennoyer had just left <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> become the second Populist Party governor in history.) “No permission will be given to use state cannon for firing a salute over the inauguration of a Wall Street plutocrat as president of the United States,” he said, and locked the cannon away under armed guard. The Democrats were able to get hold of the cannon by using an unpaid blacksmith's bill for $10 as a pretext to have the sheriff seize the weapon, and the salute was fired on schedule.|$|E

25|$|Since Lee's death, {{there have}} been six presidents of the Chicago Federation of Labor, about one every five years. Twice (Robert Healey and Don Turner) the {{presidency}} has gone to a member from the Chicago Federation of Teachers, giving the teachers union a top spokesperson in the labor federation for 14 of the last 23 years. Healey was the first president since Charles Dold in 1905 to retire from the presidency rather than die in office. Under Healey, the CFL began to distance itself from its close relationship with <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> take a more independent stance on issues. Under Turner, the CFL emphasized community investment, workforce development, affordable living, {{and an end to}} urban sprawl.|$|E
25|$|Riis's {{concern for}} the poor and {{destitute}} often caused people to assume he disliked the rich. However, Riis showed no sign of discomfort among the affluent, often asking them for their support. Although seldom involved with party politics, Riis was sufficiently disgusted by the corruption of Tammany Hall to change from being an endorser of <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> endorse the Republican Party. The period just before the Spanish–American War was difficult for Riis. He was approached by liberals who suspected that protests of alleged Spanish mistreatment of the Cubans was merely a ruse intended to provide a pretext for US expansionism; perhaps to avoid offending his friend Roosevelt, Riis refused the offer of good payment to investigate this and made nationalist statements.|$|E
25|$|Taylor was {{a strong}} critic of the Bush Administration's fiscal policy. He voted against the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003, {{claiming}} that the cuts contained in those bills would only increase the national debt. He derided the prescription drug plan passed in 2003 as a giveaway to companies that donate to the Republican Party. He {{is one of the}} House's most vehement opponents of free trade agreements and was strongly opposed to the Bush administration's proposals for reforming Social Security. He has also voted at times with more liberal members of the House with regards to Cuba. Since coming to the House, he has voted in favor of most campaign finance laws and other laws favored by more progressive elements of <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>to</b> reform politics.|$|E
