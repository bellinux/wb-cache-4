To this purpose <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> are often used. In this article we show how to manipulate interfaces containing large numbers of <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> in an efficient way. Because <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> are functionally equivalent to black and white pixels, interaction techniques from paint programs can be adopted for manipulating <b>toggle</b> <b>switches.</b> A controlled experiment shows that painting can significantly speed up interfaces containing many <b>toggle</b> <b>switches.</b> To maximize time savings, <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> should be laid out according to frequency of co-occurrences between toggles...|$|R

25|$|Three {{variants}} {{of the original}} Contender design were later developed, distinguished easily by the hammer design. The first variant has a push button selector on the hammer for choosing rimfire vs. centerfire, the second variant has a left-center-right <b>toggle</b> <b>switch</b> for selecting center fire-safe-rimfire firing pins, and the third variant has a horizontal bolt selection for choosing center fire-safe-rimfire firing pin positions. All three of these Contender variants have a cougar etched {{on the sides of}} the receiver, thereby easily distinguishing them from the later G2 Contender which has a smooth-sided receiver without an etched cougar. Some of the very earliest Contenders, those requiring a screwdriver to switch the firing pin between rimfire and centerfire, had smooth sides, without the cougar etched on the sides.|$|E

The ships fire torpedoes which are not affected by the gravitational pull of the star. The ships have a limited number of torpedoes and a limited supply of fuel, which is used when the player fires his thrusters. Torpedoes are fired one at a time by flipping a <b>toggle</b> <b>switch</b> on the computer or pressing a button on the control pad, and there is a cooldown period between launches. [...] The ships follow Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the ships can rotate at a constant rate without inertia.|$|E

40|$|A toggle map {{is a set}} of <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> {{that allows}} the {{manipulation}} of several switches with a single mouse drag interaction. Because <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> are functionally equivalent to black and white pixels interaction techniques from paint programs can be adopted for this task. A controlled experiment shows that toggle maps can speed up interfaces containing many <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> such as the interactive definition of user profiles. To maximize time savings toggle maps have to be laid-out according to co-occurrences between toggles. Efficiency gains resulting from the paint method open up new application areas such as segmented interval sliders. As an example an efficient timer dialog is presented...|$|R
40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Cell fate {{decisions}} during embryonic develop-ment and tumorigenesis pose a {{major research}} challenge in modern developmental and cancer biology. Binary cell fate decisions are usually regulated by gene circuits incorporating either classical <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> with two mutually inhibiting transcription factor (TF) genes or chimera <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> with a mutually inhibiting pair of microRNA (miRNA) and TF gene. These circuits can explain binary cell fate decisions. Importantly, intermediate cell types can exist during the differentiation of both stem cells and cancer cells. It {{has been shown}} that TF-TF self-activating <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> (SATS) can have coexistence of three metastable states (tristability), yet the role of chimera <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> in opening these additional states remains elusive. Here we present a generalized framework for both the TF-TF SATS and miRNA-TF chimera SATS, starting from the TF-promoter and miRNA-mRNA binding/unbinding dynamics. We show that the chimera SATSs can also have tristability. We demonstrate that the dynamics of miRNA-TF SATS is qualitatively {{different from that of the}} TF-TF SAT...|$|R

The most obvious external difference between the two Chinese UAVs is in the arrangement of their respective <b>toggle</b> <b>switches.</b> For AVIC Whirlwind Scout, there are only two <b>toggle</b> <b>switches,</b> both of which are installed on a cylinder along the vertical axis. For FYAT Ducted Fan UAV, there are a total of four <b>toggle</b> <b>switches,</b> and they are installed separately on different cylinders: one on a cylinder by itself, the other three on the other cylinder along the horizontal axis.|$|R
50|$|Several {{modifications}} were made. A <b>toggle</b> <b>switch</b> {{mounted on}} the back of the amplifier chassis allows switching between tube (the original) and solid-state rectification; in the latter mode, output is boosted to 50 watts. A second <b>toggle</b> <b>switch</b> allows the player to disable the Normal channel and the Vibrato effect; the preamp gain is increased, and more distortion and sustain is available. This version of the amplifier has a fifteen-inch Eminence speaker and point-to-point wiring.|$|E
