5|$|After Burgoyne's {{surrender}} on October 17, 1777 (part of {{the aftermath}} of the Saratoga Campaign), Ann Bleecker, her daughter and sister (all that remained of the family), and possibly a slave child returned to Tomhannock.

5|$|Czerniecki was an ennobled burgher {{who served}} <b>three</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> the magnate house of Princes Lubomirski as {{property}} manager and head chef. He began his service in ca. 1645, initially under Stanisław Lubomirski until 1649, then under the latter's eldest son, Aleksander Michał Lubomirski, and his grandson, Józef Karol Lubomirski. Although Czerniecki's book {{was first published}} in 1682, it must have been completed before Aleksander Michał Lubomirski's death in 1677.|$|E
5|$|It {{was founded}} as Tillingbourne Valley in 1924, {{and became a}} limited company in 1931, taking the name Tillingbourne Valley Services. It {{initially}} operated routes in the Guildford area from a garage in Chilworth using small single-deck buses painted in a maroon livery. Coach hire and excursions began in 1931, but two years later these activities split into a separate company, Tillingbourne Valley Coaches, which operated independently for a further 24 years. Until 1970 Tillingbourne was owned and managed by <b>three</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> the Trice family, before being sold to Trevor Brown.|$|E

5|$|Primarily a coming-of-age story (Bildungsroman) {{and family}} saga, the novel chronicles {{the effect of}} a mutated gene on <b>three</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> a Greek family, causing momentous changes in the protagonist's life. According to scholars, the novel's main themes are nature versus nurture, rebirth, and the differing {{experiences}} of what society constructs as polar opposites—such as those found between men and women. It discusses the pursuit of the American Dream and explores gender identity. The novel contains many allusions to Greek mythology, including creatures such as the Minotaur, half-man and half-bull, and the Chimera, a monster composed of various animal parts.|$|E

According to Tina, the overall style of the line best reflects her and Beyoncé's taste and style. Beyoncé {{and her mother}} founded their family's company Beyond Productions, which provides the licensing and brand management for House of Deréon, and its junior collection, Deréon. House of Deréon pieces were exhibited in Destiny's Child's shows and tours, during their Destiny Fulfilled era. The collection features sportswear, denim offerings with fur, outerwear and accessories that include handbags and footwear, and are available at department and specialty stores across the US and Canada.|$|E

40|$|Targeted {{therapy with}} {{epidermal}} growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKIs) {{is regarded as the}} main accepted first-line treatment on EGFR mutation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although targeted therapy for the first and two <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> TKIs may lead to longer progression-free survival (PFS) and better tolerance for patients, the long-term treatment will inevitably lead to drug resistance. Among them, more than 50 % of acquired resistance is associated with T 790 M mutation. The latest guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) have been proposed that the <b>three</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> TKI (Osimertinib) can be used in first-line TKI therapy progress with detecting T 790 M mutations in patients. Encouraged by the treatment time of the median PFS up to 13 months and sequential EGFR-TKIs treatment which brought from the <b>three</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> TKI, we also face serious challenges, such as how to achieve the detecting and the dynamic monitoring of T 790 M, the research progress, mechanism of drug resistance and subsequent treatment <b>of</b> the existing <b>three</b> <b>generation</b> TKI etc. This article will revolve around the above hot issues...|$|R

5|$|Europa's tale, {{well known}} in later {{classical}} literature and beyond, appears in a largely familiar form in the Catalogue. She caught Zeus's eye while she and some friends were gathering flowers in a meadow. The god transformed into a bull with breath smelling of saffron, {{in the guise of}} which he abducted Europa, carrying her upon his back to Crete. There she bore Minos, Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon to Zeus, and he gave her a necklace made by Hephaestus that would figure in Theban saga as the Necklace of Harmonia. Sarpedon ruled Lycia, and was apparently granted a lifespan equal to <b>three</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> men by Zeus. His death at Troy and the rain of blood it inspired Zeus to send is briefly described. Minos ruled Crete, succeeding his stepfather Asterion. Poseidon sent up from the sea a bull which had sex with Minos' wife Pasiphae, siring the Minotaur. To Minos she also bore Deucalion, Catreus, Androgeos and Eurygyes, though it is equally possible that these last two names referred to a single son. At least one daughter, Ariadne, was surely present, for the myth of Androgeos–Eurygyes' death in Athens and the subsequent sacrifice of Athenian youths to the Minotaur will presuppose Theseus' expedition to Crete and Ariadne's complicity in slaying the beast.|$|E
5|$|More recently, habitat {{destruction}} and degradation {{have become the}} principal dangers, and a further reduction of 50% is expected in giant otter numbers within the 20 years after 2004 (about the span of <b>three</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> giant otters). Typically, loggers first move into rainforest, clearing the vegetation along riverbanks. Farmers follow, creating depleted soil and disrupted habitats. As human activity expands, giant otter home ranges become increasingly isolated. Subadults leaving in search of new territory find it impossible to set up family groups. Specific threats from human industry include unsustainable mahogany logging {{in parts of the}} giant otter range, and concentrations of mercury in its diet of fish, a byproduct of gold mining. Water pollution from mining, fossil fuel extraction, and agriculture is a serious danger; concentrations of pesticides and other chemicals are magnified at each step in the food chain, and can poison top predators such as the giant otter.|$|E
5|$|There were {{professional}} {{musicians in}} the previous <b>three</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> Holst's family {{and it was clear}} from his early years that he would follow the same calling. He hoped to become a pianist, but was prevented by neuritis in his right arm. Despite his father's reservations, he pursued a career as a composer, studying at the Royal College of Music under Charles Villiers Stanford. Unable to support himself by his compositions, he played the trombone professionally and later became a teacher—a great one, according to his colleague Ralph Vaughan Williams. Among other teaching activities he built up a strong tradition of performance at Morley College, where he served as musical director from 1907 until 1924, and pioneered music education for women at St Paul's Girls' School, where he taught from 1905 until his death in 1934. He was the founder of a series of Whitsun music festivals, which ran from 1916 for the remainder of his life.|$|E

His father, Neumann Miksa (English: Max Neumann) was a banker, who held a {{doctorate}} in law. He had moved to Budapest from Pécs {{at the end of the}} 1880s. Miksa's father and grandfather were both born in Ond (now part of the town of Szerencs), Zemplén County, northern Hungary. John's mother was Kann Margit (English: Margaret Kann); her parents were Jakab Kann and Katalin Meisels. <b>Three</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> the Kann family lived in spacious apartments above the Kann-Heller offices in Budapest; von Neumann's family occupied an 18-room apartment on the top floor.|$|E
