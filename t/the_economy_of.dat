40|$|Abstract: The {{strategic}} {{theory of}} resource-based view (RBV) put Penrose (1959) in the spotlight. The {{key to understanding}} Penrose’s assertion is <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> growth independent <b>of</b> <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> size. According to Penrose, even when <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> size are not working, <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> growth exist regardless <b>of</b> size. Further, <b>the</b> <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> growth are temporary in nature and disappear once expansion is completed. In which managerial services are <b>the</b> <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> growth embodied? This paper hypothesizes that <b>the</b> <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> growth occur where there are unused start-up expert managerial services. Regardless of size, where these services exist, paving the company’s way by step-by-step growth should produce profits...|$|R
