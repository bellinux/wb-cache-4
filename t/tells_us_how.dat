5|$|Where ν and Ediff are as {{described}} above, Γ is the jump or hopping rate, T is temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Ediff must be {{smaller than the}} energy of desorption for diffusion to occur, otherwise desorption processes would dominate. Importantly, equation 1 <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> very strongly the jump rate varies with temperature. The manner in which diffusion takes place {{is dependent on the}} relationship between Ediff and kBT as is given in the thermodynamic factor: when Ediff < kBT the thermodynamic factor approaches unity and Ediff ceases to be a meaningful barrier to diffusion. This case, known as mobile diffusion, is relatively uncommon and has only been observed in a few systems. For the phenomena described throughout this article, it is assumed that Ediff >> kBT and therefore Γ << ν. In the case of Fickian diffusion it is possible to extract both the ν and Ediff from an Arrhenius plot of the logarithm of the diffusion coefficient, D, versus 1/T. For cases where more than one diffusion mechanism is present (see below), there may be more than one Ediff such that the relative distribution between the different processes would change with temperature.|$|E

25|$|This chapter explains, and {{is based}} on, the belief that all mankind is descended from Adam through the sons of Noah. It <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> Noah's son Japheth is the forebear of all Europeans (see Japhetites), how Japheth's son Magog is the forebear of the Gaels and Scythians, and how Fénius Farsaid is the forebear of the Gaels. Fénius, a prince of Scythia, is {{described}} as one of 72 chieftains who built the Tower of Babel. His son Nel weds Scota, daughter of an Egyptian pharaoh, {{and they have a}} son named Goídel Glas. Goídel crafts the Goidelic (Gaelic) language from the original 72 languages that arose after the confusion of tongues. Goídel's offspring, the Goidels (Gaels), leave Egypt {{at the same time as}} the Israelites (the Exodus) and settle in Scythia. After some time they leave Scythia and spend 440 years wandering the Earth, undergoing a series of trials and tribulations akin to those of the Israelites, who spent 40 years wandering in the wilderness. After many years at sea, they settle in the Maeotian marshes, then sail via Crete and Sicily and conquer Iberia. There, Goídel's descendant Breogán founds a city called Brigantia, and builds a tower from the top of which his son Íth glimpses Ireland.|$|E

25|$|I {{have further}} shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the {{horticulturist}} and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part {{in the evolution of}} society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It strikes me that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> much that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.|$|E
500|$|Durkheim {{agrees with}} Kant that within morality, {{there is an}} element of obligation, [...] "a moral {{authority}} which, by manifesting itself in certain precepts particularly important to it, confers upon [...] an obligatory character." [...] Morality <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> to act from a position of superiority. There exists a certain, pre-established moral norm to which we must conform. It is through this view that Durkheim makes a first critique of Kant in saying that moral duties originate in society, and are not to be found in some universal moral concept such as the categorical imperative. Durkheim also argues that morality is characterized not just by this obligation, but is also something that is desired by the individual. The individual believes that by adhering to morality, they are serving the common Good, and for this reason, the individual submits voluntarily to the moral commandment.|$|E

She felt that the chorus was more melodic {{but it was the}} lyrics and the dance beats which did not {{complete}} the track. Bansal said that [...] "Love Profusion" [...] could have been composed better. Ed Howard from Stylus Magazine wrote that [...] "Love Profusion", along with the song [...] "Intervention", [...] "address Madonna's marriage to director Guy Ritchie", and [...] "find the once-cynical pop star surprisingly open and emotional, which prompts her to spit out cliché after cliché as she <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> happy she is". Alan Braidwood from BBC Music felt that the song was the most straight forward dance track on the album. He added that [...] "this is one of those [...] which could become a favorite and it feels like a classic upbeat Madonna song. It fuses the message behind the song American Life with Mirwais' beats and acoustic elements really well". Sean O'Brien from The People complimented the song for its [...] "great melody and acoustic guitar flavor to it", and deduced {{that it would be a}} hit in the night clubs. Dan Gennoe from Dotmusic website gave a positive review of the track, calling [...] "Love Profusion", along with [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process" [...] from American Life, [...] "gracious" [...] and [...] "beautiful" [...] songs.

40|$|Scientific, {{and more}} {{specifically}} empirical observations, are incapable of deriving a cohesive moral theory based solely on those distinctions. What we find in the ethical world is far more complex than any one series of observations and scientific theories which could establish or break down existing moral theory.
