5000|$|The first {{screw-down}} tap mechanism was patented {{and manufactured}} by the Rotherham brass founders Guest and Chrimes in 1845. Most older taps use a soft rubber or neoprene washer which is screwed down onto a valve seat {{in order to}} stop the flow. This is called a [...] "globe valve" [...] in engineering and, while it gives a leak-proof seal and good fine adjustment of flow, both the rubber washer and the valve seat are subject to wear (and for the seat, also corrosion) over time, so that eventually no tight seal is formed in the closed position, resulting in a leaking <b>tap.</b> The <b>washer</b> can be replaced and the valve seat resurfaced (at least a few times), but globe valves are never maintenance-free.|$|R
30|$|Most pattern {{classification}} {{systems are}} usually developed {{based on the}} training of historical data, and as a result, the performance of these models relies heavily {{on the amount of}} collected information. However, in many cases, such data collection process is relatively costly, which eventually limits the efficiency as well as the widespread implementation of the final developed model. In this context, the paper focuses on presenting an advanced universal water management system, which could interface with both water consumers and utilities via smart phone and web application. Originally, Autoflow©, a prototype tool that is used to disaggregate total water consumption into each end-use category was developed, which achieved an accuracy ranging from 74 to 94 %. However, a drawback of this model was that it was trained with data collected from only Australia; therefore, accuracy reductions would likely be observed when this system is implemented in different countries having very different water using appliances and behaviour patterns. To avoid the costly data collection process for model calibration when operating in new regions, this research study introduces an enhanced model, namely AutoflowU (i.e. U stands for Universal). This new tool can be applied in residential properties globally to autonomously disaggregate water consumption into the seven main water end-use categories, namely: shower, toilet, <b>tap,</b> clothes <b>washer,</b> dishwasher, evaporative air cooler and irrigation, without the need for collecting new regional end-use data for model calibration. In order to develop this new tool, Decision Trees, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Self Organising Map (SOM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) techniques were utilised. The test results obtained from 230 properties in both Australia and the US showed that the AutoflowU achieved 72 – 93 % accuracy.|$|R
40|$|Bottom-up {{urban water}} demand {{forecasting}} based on empirical data for individual water end uses or micro-components (e. g., toilet, shower, etc.) for different households of varying characteristics is undoubtedly superior to top-down estimates originating from bulk water metres {{that are currently}} performed. Residential water end-use studies partially enabled by modern smart metering technologies such as those used in the South East Queensland Residential End Use Study (SEQREUS) provide the opportunity to align disaggregated water end-use demand for households with an extensive database covering household demographic, socio-economic and water appliance stock efficiency information. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) provide the ideal technique for aligning these databases to extract the key determinants for each water end-use category, with the view to building a residential water end-use demand forecasting model. Three conventional ANNs were used: two feed-forward back propagation networks and one radial basis function network. A sigmoid activation hidden layer and linear activation output layer produced the most accurate forecasting models. The end-use forecasting models had R 2 values of 0. 33, 0. 37, 0. 60, 0. 57, 0. 57, 0. 21 and 0. 41 for toilet, <b>tap,</b> shower, clothes <b>washer,</b> dishwasher, bath and total internal demand, respectively. All of the forecasting models except the bath demand were able to reproduce the means and medians of the frequency distributions of the training and validation sets. This study concludes with an application of the developed forecasting model for predicting the water savings derived from a citywide implementation of a residential water appliance retrofit program (i. e., retrofitting with efficient toilets, clothes washers and shower heads).

40|$|This paper uses a {{detailed}} water end use data registry {{generated from the}} South East Queensland Residential End Use Study (SEQREUS) to examine (a) peak hourly and daily demand, and (b) water-related energy demand. The impact of water-efficient fixtures and appliances, as required by current building codes in Queensland, is also explored. The four peak demand days selected had increasing peak day factors of 1. 3, 1. 5, 1. 6 and 1. 7. The range of these values is slightly lower than those used in the Department of Environment and Resource Management (DERM) guidelines where the peak day factors range from 1. 5 to 2. 3, suggesting that the frequency and volume of peaking factors may be lower than those that are currently being used for network distribution design; due likely to the high penetration of water-efficient technology and growing water conservation awareness by consumers. This type of knowledge can facilitate the optimisation of infrastructure design and sizing and inform the subsequent deferral of such assets. In terms of water-related energy demand, {{it was found that}} the hot water components of showers, and to a lesser extent, <b>taps</b> and clothes <b>washers</b> were the most influential. Shower energy consumption for electric cylinder hot water systems (HWS) and solar electric-boosted HWS was 810 and 351 kWh/p/year, respectively. The type of hot water system was significant in dictating the volume of energy-related carbon emissions, with the results confirming the significant impact that electric storage water heating has on total household energy consumption and related carbon emissions. Substantial savings can be achieved by substituting water (eg, high star rating clothes washers and shower heads) and energy (eg, solar hot water system) efficient appliances in the home. Knowledge on the end uses that are influencing peak water and energy demand can: 1) facilitate the optimisation of infrastructure design and sizing and inform the decision process regarding subsequent deferral of these expensive assets; and 2) underpin future sustainability codes for new buildings.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2014 Bu çalışmada öncelikle dünya rezervlerinin büyük bir kısmı ülkemiz sınırları dahilinde olan bor cevherlerinin ana minerallerinden olan kolemanit cevheri, Eti Maden Bigadiç işletmelerinden konsantre olarak temin edilmiştir.

Alumina is {{the most}} widely used oxide ceramic material. Its {{applications}} are widespread, and include spark plugs, <b>tap</b> <b>washers,</b> pump seals, electronic substrates, grinding media, abrasion resistant tiles, cutting tools, bioceramics, (hip-joints), body armour, laboratory ware and wear parts for the textile and paper industries. Very large tonnages are also used in the manufacture of monolithic and brick refractories. It is also used mixed with other materials such as flake graphite where even more severe applications are envisaged, such as pouring spouts and sliding gate valves. Sintering of alumina ceramics at relatively low temperatures to obtain dense and fine grained microstructures with sufficient mechanical properties is one of tecnological investigations. Alumina ceramics are extensively used for structural applications due to alumina’s high melting point, chemical stability, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties such as hardness and wear resistance at elevated temperatures. Restrictions to the applications of alumina arise due to the problems related to low thermal shock resistance and low fracture toughness.   In present day society, boron, an important element of both chemical and biological interest, has a variety of uses. Modern uses of boron-bearing minerals and boron derivatives include heat resistant glass (e. g., pyrex), fiberglass, ceramics, washing products (e. g., detergents and soaps), special alloys, fertilizers, fire retardants, wood treatment agents, insecticides and microbiocides. Colemanite (Ca 2 B 6 O 11. 5 H 2 O), a major source of boron mineral, is semi-soluble calcium-borate hydrate that is found in massive beds with other calcium containing minerals such as calcite and gypsium, and a variety of clays. Colemanite {{is the most}} important calcium containing commercial borate mineral with 5 mol crystal water. Direct use of colemanite is problematic for some industrial applications, e. g., in glasses and ceramics. Moreover, transporting raw colemanite and removing impurities and crystal water is expensive and energy inefficient, as colemanite must then undergo heat treatment before use, or the production process must be carried out under certain conditions. Ideally, the removal of impurities and crystal water at the same time will increase the use of the use of colemanite as amorphous B 2 O 3. Therefore, decrepitation or calcination is receiving increased attention. When raw colemanite is heated up to its decomposition temperature, only colemanite explodes, breaking up into a fine powder. This unique characteristic could be utilized in the upgrading of colemanite. Densification is the outcome of a combination of numerous parameters during processing, which include the powder characteristics, process variables, and sintering kinetics. The use of fine starting powder without agglomeration in the green preforms may improve densification. Regarding the latter, specific additives such as low melting oxides can be used to enhance the sinterability of powder. Additives in small amounts are deliberately and commonly used in ceramic systems to influence densification processes either by reducing sintering temperature or suppressing/promoting grain growth or enhancing mechanical and physical properties. Such additives can promote liquid phase formation at lower sintering temperatures and may considerably increase the rate of sintering. During sintering process, a viscous liquid may promote an additional diffusion mechanism of dissolution, particle rearrangement and capillary forces and finally may improve the densification. A variety of oxides such as B 2 O 3, MgO, TiO 2, SiO 2, MnO 2, Cr 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3 are some of the typical additives that have been commonly used in alumina ceramics. The fundamental explanation of anisotropic grain growth in alumina is not totally understood but includes several proposals: inhomogeneous distribution of the dopant and the presence of a liquid phase on the grain boundary. In this study, initially, colemanite mineral which is found in our country as large scale deposits along worldwide, provided as concentrate from Eti Maden Bigadiç enterprices. The tenor of B 2 O 3  increased from % 33, 08 to % 58, 40 by decrepitation at 4500 C – 2 hours and dry screening processes after cooling down to the room temperature. The characteristic of the obtained colemanite powder determined by experiment studies and powder is processed for incorporating with Al 2 O 3 in order to produce structural ceramics. The experiments for powder characterization are laser particle size distribution, pycnometer density, arnold density, tapped density and chemical analysis before&after decrepitation for the colemanite powder. Afterwards, enriched colemanite powder added to commercial Alcoa™ alumina powder with the ratios of % 1 - 3 - 5. These powder mixtures pelletized by PVA for dry pressing and pressed at 175 MPa to obtain green samples. Green density measurements made for the obtained samples to compare with theorical densities. Pressed samples have been sintered at 13500 C, 14500 C and 15500 C for 2 hours and freely cooled down to room temperature. SEM scanning electron microscope has been used for investigating the microstructure of the sintered samples. Besides, water absorption rates, sintered densities, relative densities, XRD phase analysis and micro hardness values measured in order for investigation of the effects of colemanite added alumina structural ceramics.   Eventually, the examination of powder characterization and sintered samples characterization have been made and commented for the obtained results. After sintering at 13500 C, % 3 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in micro hardness values, % 1 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in sintered density values, accordingly undoped alumina. For the same sintering temperature and soaking time, when the addition of colemanite increases, grain growth is also increases according to the scanning electron microscope images. It has been investigated that, while the colemanite additions inside alumina increase, water absorption rates are also increase at the samples which are sintered at 14500 C and 15500 C. XRD measuring results shows corundum and aluminum borate structures obtained during sintering of the samples.   The results in this thesis have revealed that, the place of use where the porosity and hardness is not important like undoped alumina, 1350 C sintered and % 3 added colemanite to alumina products can be substituted for industrial usage. 200 C decrease in sintering temperature brings many advantages such as; saving up the energy consumption, highly increasing the working life of the sintering furnaces, thermal isolation elements and sintering casettes,  reducing amortisation costs of the sintering furnaces, also brings in an alternative for the investing lower temperature furnaces which are cheaper, substantially reduces maintenance, investment and production costs.
