5|$|Although Gordon was a {{tropical}} storm {{for most of its}} existence, it caused enormous damage and loss of life. The United Nations estimated death toll in Haiti was 1,122. Six deaths were reported in Costa Rica, five in the Dominican Republic, two in Jamaica, two in Cuba, and eight in Florida. Property damage to the United States was estimated at $400million (1994 USD, $ USD). Property damage statistics for the other affected areas are not available, but were reportedly severe in both Haiti and Cuba.

5|$|The {{depression}} brought {{widespread rain}} to West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh during its lifespan, with rains of 140mm (5.5inches) as far west as Lucknow. The rains in Uttar Pradesh caused severe property damage and flooding, with some 150people losing {{their lives in}} the state. The Ganges flooded in northern Bihar, inundating parts of Munger District, whilst the Gandaki River flooded parts of Motihari. The rains worsened floods in south Bengal, increasing the death <b>toll</b> <b>from</b> the floods there to 80 and affecting 8million people, with considerable damage done to crops and housing. Jaleswar in Orissa was entirely flooded.|$|E
5|$|The Mackinac Bridge carries I-75 {{across the}} Straits of Mackinac that {{separate}} Michigan's Upper and Lower peninsulas; the straits also form {{the connection between}} Lakes Michigan and Huron. The structure, {{unlike the rest of}} the state highways in Michigan like I-75, is under the maintenance and control of the Mackinac Bridge Authority (MBA). The authority collects a <b>toll</b> <b>from</b> traffic that crosses the bridge, which , is $4 for passenger cars and $5 per axle for commercial vehicles and motorhomes. In addition to cash, the MBA offers a pre-paid debit card option for the payment of tolls. The authority also provides a driver assistance program that will drive vehicles across the bridge at no additional charge; motorists who use the service have a fear of bridges. Because the bridge normally only allows motor vehicles, bicyclists and snowmobiles shuttled across are subject to fees. The authority maintains a small police department to patrol the bridge and escort vehicles across, and a pair of radio station transmitters that broadcast bridge conditions and travel information on AM530 and AM1610.|$|E

50|$|After a 1983 truck {{crash that}} killed seven {{people at the}} Stratford toll plaza, toll opponents {{pressured}} the State of Connecticut to remove <b>tolls</b> <b>from</b> the Turnpike in 1985. Three years later, these same opponents successfully lobbied the Connecticut General Assembly to pass legislation abolishing tolls on all of Connecticut's highways (with the exception of two car ferries across the Connecticut River in Chester and Glastonbury). While the 1983 Stratford accident was cited as {{the main reason for}} abolishing tolls in Connecticut, the underlying reason was that federal legislation at that time forbade states with <b>toll</b> roads <b>from</b> using federal funds for road projects. Because the Mianus River Bridge was rebuilt with federal highway funds following its June 1983 collapse, Connecticut was required by Section 113(c) of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 to remove <b>tolls</b> <b>from</b> the Turnpike once its construction bonds were paid off.|$|R
