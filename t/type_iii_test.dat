40|$|Laboratory {{and field}} studies were {{completed}} {{to characterize the}} geochemistry and microbiology of drainage emanating from low-S content waste-rock test piles at the Diavik Diamond Mine (Diavik) from 2007 through 2010. The potential use of small-scale laboratory humidity-cell experiments to predict the water quality from larger-scale field-based experiments also was examined. Waste rock at Diavik is segregated into three categories according to sulfide content: Type I (target concentration: 0. 08 wt. % S). Four high-density polyethylene tanks, 2 m in diameter by 2 m in height, were filled with and surrounded by waste rock (active zone lysimeters; AZLs) at the Diavik site to study the upper 2 m of the active zone within a waste-rock pile and to evaluate the quality of effluent released from waste rock with differing S contents (Type I AZLs: 0. 014 wt. % S and Type III AZLs: 0. 035 wt. % S). In addition, three waste-rock test piles also were constructed at Diavik, two uncovered test piles (Type I test pile: 0. 035 wt. % S and <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> <b>test</b> pile: 0. 053 wt. % S) and a third pile was constructed based on the mine-closure plan which consists of waste rock (Type III: 0. 082 wt. % S) capped with a 1. 5 m layer of till and a 3 m layer of Type I material (Covered test pile). Each test pile is underlain by a high-density polyethylene geomembrane that captures and directs water to outflow drains. Results show that the release and transport of blasting residuals {{could be used as}} a resident tracer, indicating the first flush of water through the AZLs and the test piles. Variations in concentrations of blasting residuals and the gradual rate of dissipation provide an indication of the heterogeneity of the distribution of blasting residuals and the relative contributions of water and solutes from different flow paths. As temperatures within the test piles increase in response to ambient air temperature increases, larger proportions of the test pile contributed to the outflow, and increased concentrations of blasting residuals were observed in waste-rock test pile effluent. Effluent from the Type I AZLs and test pile maintained near-neutral pH (ranged from 5. 8 to 8) with concentrations of SO₄²⁻ 1500 mg L⁻¹) suggesting sulfide oxidation was occurring. Maximum concentrations of SO₄²⁻, Al, Zn, Ni, Co, and Cu were observed in 2009 during the first flush of water through the <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> <b>test</b> pile. A sequence of acid-neutralization reactions was inferred based on the water chemistry of the effluent derived from the Type III AZLs and waste-rock test pile. This acid-neutralization sequence is similar to those observed at other AMD impacted sites. A series of mineral dissolution-precipitation reactions controlled pH and metal mobility; carbonate-mineral dissolution consumed H⁺ generated from sulfide-mineral oxidation at near neutral pH and the dissolution of Al and Fe (oxy) hydroxides consumed H⁺ at pH < 5. 0. The cover system on the Covered test pile dampened the effects of ambient air temperature on the internal temperatures within the core of the Covered test pile. As a result, the Covered test pile had a relatively steady change in flow rate, with decreased flow from June to August, which led to a slow but prolonged release of sulfide-mineral oxidation products, such as SO₄²⁻ and dissolved metals, including Ni, Co, Zn, Cd, and Cu, compared to the uncovered <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> <b>test</b> pile. The pH decreased in 2008 and remained low for the duration of the study, whereas the pH in the uncovered test pile was near-neutral at the beginning of each field season in May and decreased to < 4. 2 by the end of the field season in November. The microbiological-community profiles observed in the AZLs and waste-rock test piles suggest typical AMD-related species were present in acidic effluent with elevated concentrations of metals, whereas typical soil microbes were present in effluent with a near-neutral pH and lower concentrations of SO₄²⁻ and dissolved metals. The Type III AZLs, <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> <b>test</b> pile, and Covered test pile maintained populations of acidophilic Fe-oxidizers, whereas, the Type I AZLs and Type I test pile maintained populations of neutrophilic S-oxidizers. Laboratory humidity-cell (1 kg) results were scaled up to estimate the water quality from the Type III AZLs (6 t) using measured physical and chemical parameters. The results suggested over-prediction of SO₄²⁻ and metal concentrations when low mean annual precipitation occurred, limiting flushing of predicted oxidation products. In subsequent years with higher mean annual precipitation oxidation products from previous years were liberated and resulted in the under prediction of SO₄²⁻ and metal concentrations. Additionally, Fe and Al were over-predicted because Fe and Al concentrations in the AZL effluent may be controlled by the solubility and formation of secondary minerals, such as Fe oxyhydroxides, jarosite, and goethite, which were not included in the scaling procedure...|$|E

40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is {{intrinsically}} cross-resistant to virtually all b-lactam antibiotics. The central determinant for the MRSA phenotype is the mecA gene, whose transcriptional control may be mediated by a repressor (mecI) and a sensor/inducer (mecR 1). The mecI-mecR 1 -mediated induction of mecA takes several hours rendering the strains phenotypically susceptible {{in spite of}} the presence of the resistance gene. Therefore, it has been proposed that the full resistance to b-lactams observed in many contemporary clinical MRSA strains requires a non-functional mecI-mecR 1 regulatory system. The mecA gene is embedded in a large chromosomal cassette (the SCCmec element) for which several structural types have been described. Some epidemic MRSA clones, typically expressing full b-lactam resistance, carry SCCmec elements that contain an intact mecI-mecR 1 locus (e. g. SCCmec <b>types</b> II and <b>III).</b> We have addressed this apparent contradiction by first sequencing the mecI coding region and mecA promoter sequences in a collection of prototype MRSA strains characterized by different SCCmec types. A conserved non-sense mutation within mecI was detected in all SCCmec <b>type</b> <b>III</b> strains <b>tested,</b> presumably responsible for a non-functional truncated MecI protein and, therefore, explaining the full resistance phenotype. In SCCmec type II strains no conserved mutations were found. We next transformed a collection of prototype MRSA epidemic strains with a recombinant plasmid overexpressing a wild-type copy of mecI.

The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the prevalence of Radix Entomolaris (RE) in permanent mandibular first and second molars in the population of Kerman, in the southeast of Iran. Materials and Methods. From a collection of 500 mandibular first and second molar teeth extracted over 2015 - 2016 at dental clinics in Kerman, teeth were scored for an additional distolingual root, and the average root length and root morphology of this extra root were determined using the De Moor classification scheme. Results. In this population, RE occurred in 6 % of mandibular first molars (4 % with a straight apex (Type I) and 2 % with buccal apical curvature (<b>Type</b> <b>III)).</b> In all cases, RE was the shortest root, with an average root length of 18. 37 [*]mm.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of sulfide minerals in mine {{waste rock}} {{has the potential}} to generate acidity and contribute sulfate, metals and other trace constituents to drainage. The rate and extent to which this process occurs are dependent upon climactic conditions and the overall hydrologic, geochemical and physical properties of the waste rock. A laboratory and field-based study is currently being conducted at the Diavik Diamond Mine in the Northwest Territories, Canada, which is investigating the evolution of waste rock exposed to subaerial conditions in the continuous permafrost region. Over the course of the mine life, Diavik is expected to generate a stock pile up to 120 Mt of low-sulfide waste-rock composed primarily of granite and granite pegmatite with smaller amounts of biotite schist which occurs as xenoliths, and trace contributions from diabase dykes. Waste rock is segregated based on sulfur content into Type I (0. 08 wt % S) rock. The Diavik Waste Rock Research Project includes four 2 m by 2 m lysimeter experiments, two each constructed with Type I and <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> waste rock. Also constructed were two well-instrumented, 15 m high test scale waste-rock piles, one composed of Type I and one composed of <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> uncovered waste rock, and one covered test pile based on a reclamation concept which consists of a <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> waste rock core, a 1. 5 m glacial till layer, and a 3 m layer of Type I waste rock. In addition, instrumentation was installed in four locations of the operational waste-rock stockpile. The geochemical differences between the Type I and <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> lysimeters and <b>test</b> piles is discussed to compare the non-acid generating Type I waste rock with the potentially acid-generating <b>Type</b> <b>III.</b> The effluent from the Covered test pile retained the character of the <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> waste-rock core over the course of observation producing slightly acidic drainage, possibly due to a zone of unfrozen till on the crest as a result of heat trace within the test pile. Observations from the geochemistry of the <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> waste rock will also be compared to mineralogical analysis from <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> samples collected during installation of instruments in the full scale waste-rock stockpile. Due to the low concentration of sulfide minerals, advanced techniques such as SEM and synchrotron-based analyses were employed for in-depth characterization of initial sulfide-oxidation products. SEM images and elemental mapping reveal development of reaction rims on many pyrrhotite grains, but lower instances of weathering of pyrite. Distinct zonation of weathering trends between depths within the stockpile was also absent. These observations indicate that the waste rock is in the early weathering stages may not yet be affected by the formation of permafrost. These observations act as a baseline for future studies. Correlations between the mineralogical and geochemical analyses, in addition to future monitoring and continuation of these studies, will assist in understanding the evolution of waste rock stored in a permafrost environment...|$|R

40|$|<b>Type</b> <b>III</b> {{interferon}} (IFN) {{is a novel}} {{member of}} the interferon family. <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> IFN utilizes a receptor complex {{different from that of}} type I IFN, but both types of IFN induce STAT 1, STAT 2, and STAT 3 activation. Here we describe a detailed comparison of signal transduction initiated by type I and <b>type</b> <b>III</b> IFN. Gene expression array analysis showed that IFN <b>types</b> I and <b>III</b> induced a similar subset of genes. In particular, no genes were induced uniquely by <b>type</b> <b>III</b> IFN. Next, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis to investigate the promoter activation by <b>types</b> I and <b>III</b> IFN. The ChIP assays demonstrated that stimulation of cells with both type I and <b>type</b> <b>III</b> IFN resulted in the recruitment of ISGF 3 transcription factor components to the promoter region of responsive genes and in an increase of polymerase II loading and histone acetylation. Whereas IFN type I signaling was observed for a broad spectrum of cell lines, <b>type</b> <b>III</b> IFN signaling was more restricted. The lack of IFN <b>type</b> <b>III</b> signaling was correlated with a low expression of the IL 28 Ra component of the IFN <b>type</b> <b>III</b> receptor, and IL 28 Ra overexpression was sufficient to restore IFN <b>type</b> <b>III</b> signaling. We also tested the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases by <b>type</b> <b>III</b> IFN and found that <b>type</b> <b>III</b> IFN relies strongly upon both p 38 and JNK MAP kinases for gene induction.

40|$|Pseudomonas syringae strains deliver {{variable}} {{numbers of}} <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effector proteins into plant cells during infection. These proteins {{are required for}} virulence, because strains incapable of delivering them are nonpathogenic. We implemented a whole-genome, high-throughput screen for identifying P. syringae <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effector genes. The screen relied on FACS and an arabinose-inducible hrpL σ factor to automate the identification and cloning of HrpL-regulated genes. We determined whether candidate genes encode <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effector proteins by creating and testing full-length protein fusions to a reporter called Δ 79 AvrRpt 2 that, when fused to known <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effector proteins, is translocated and elicits a hypersensitive response in leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana expressing the RPS 2 plant disease resistance protein. Δ 79 AvrRpt 2 is thus a marker for <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion system-dependent translocation, the most critical criterion for defining <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effector proteins. We describe our screen and the collection of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effector proteins from two pathovars of P. syringae. This stringent functional criteria defined 29 <b>type</b> <b>III</b> proteins from P. syringae pv. tomato, and 19 from P. syringae pv. phaseolicola race 6. Our data provide full functional annotation of the hrpL-dependent <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effector suites from two sequenced P. syringae pathovars and show that <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effector protein suites are highly variable in this pathogen, presumably reflecting the evolutionary selection imposed by the various host plants...|$|R
40|$|Yersinia <b>type</b> <b>III</b> {{machines}} secrete protein substrates {{across the}} bacterial envelope. Secretion signals of some substrates have been identified; however, the mechanisms whereby these signals interact with <b>type</b> <b>III</b> machines are not known. Here {{we show that}} fusion of YopR, an early secretion substrate, to the N terminus of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or other tightly folded proteins generates impassable hybrids that cannot travel the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> pathway. YopR hybrids capture YscN, the ATPase that provides energy for <b>type</b> <b>III</b> transport reactions, in the bacterial cytoplasm. Eleven N-terminal residues function as the YopR secretion signal, which is required for both binding to YscN and blocking the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> pathway. When expressed during <b>type</b> <b>III</b> machine assembly, YopR-DHFR blocks all secretion. Delayed expression of YopR-DHFR, when yersiniae have already engaged the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> pathway, blocks secretion of early (YscP) but not of late (effector Yops) substrates. These observations support a model whereby <b>type</b> <b>III</b> machines are programmed to secrete a sequence of proteins that can be disrupted when an impassable early substrate interacts with the YscN ATPase and blocks the transport of late substrates...|$|R

The link between both emissions {{has been investigated}} in many previous studies, but no statistical studies have compared both coronal and interplanetary <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts with X-ray flares. Aims. Using events where the coronal radio emission above 100 MHz is exclusively from <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts, we revisited some long-standing questions regarding the relation between <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts and X-ray flares: Do all coronal <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts have X-ray counter-parts? What correlation, if any, occurs between radio and X-ray intensities? What X-ray and radio signatures above 100 MHz occur in connection with interplanetary <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts below 14 MHz? Methods. We analysed ten years of data from 2002 to 2011 starting with a selection of coronal <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts above 100 MHz. We used X-ray flare information from RHESSI > 6 keV to {{make a list of}} 321 events that have associated <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts and X-ray flares, encompassing at least 28 % of the initial sample of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> events. We then examined the timings, intensities, associated GOES class, and whether there was an associated interplanetary radio signature in both radio and X-rays. Results. For our 321 events with radio and X-ray signatures, the X-ray emission at 6 keV usually lasted much longer than the groups of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts at frequencies > 100 MHz. The selected events were mostly associated with GOES B and C class flares. A weak correlation was found between the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> radio flux at frequencies below 327 MHz and the X-ray intensity at 25 – 50 keV, with an absence of events at high X-ray intensity and low <b>type</b> <b>III</b> radio flux. The weakness of the correlation is related to the coherent emission mechanism of radio <b>type</b> <b>IIIs</b> which can produce high radio fluxes by low density electron beams. Interplanetary <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts (10 3 SFU), relating to electron beams with more energetic electrons above 25 keV and events where magnetic flux tubes extend into the high corona.

40|$|It {{has proved}} {{possible}} to transform an extreme rough variant of pneumococcus {{back to the}} rough state {{by the action of}} the desoxyribonucleate fractions of either rough or <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> smooth pneumococci. In a second step, the rough pneumococci produced by this transformation were further changed to the <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> smooth state by means of the desoxyribonucleate fraction of <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> smooth organisms. With use of the <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> desoxyribonucleate, the two steps could be accomplished successively, but not simultaneously, during the growth of a single inoculum of the extreme rough form. These findings have been interpreted as indicating that the desoxyribonucleic acid fraction of <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> smooth pneumococci contains two transforming principles of differing specificity, while the same fraction of rough pneumococci contains but one of these principles. Two distinct spontaneous variants of <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> smooth pneumococci have been isolated which seem to differ from normal <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> smooth pneumococci in synthesizing smaller amounts of the specific polysaccharide. Tests have indicated that these variant <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> races differ from the normal in possessing altered <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> transforming principles. Each of the new transforming agents when influencing rough bacteria, is strictly specific in its action, inducing as it does the formation of the corresponding variant <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> pneumococci. Interaction between the two new transforming principles and rough pneumococci can lead to the production of normal <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> organisms, although neither principle alone can do it. This is interpreted as indicating that the two mutated <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> transforming principles are qualitatively different from each other. Another kind of two-step transformation was accomplished by converting rough pneumococci first into the variant <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> pneumococci which produced very little specific polysaccharide, and then by transforming these latter into normal <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> organisms. After the two-step transformation of the extreme rough pneumococcus, both transforming principles used to effect this can be recognized in the <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> smooth pneumococci finally recovered. By contrast, in the two-step transformation of the rough pneumococcus by way of an intermediate smooth form, only the second transforming principle can be obtained from the resulting fully smooth organisms. The meaning of these facts is discussed...|$|R

Methods : the aminoterminal propeptide (PIIINP) and telopeptide (IIINTP) of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> procollagen and collagen, respectively, were immunologically measured in the soluble and insoluble fractions of the extracellular matrix. The assay for PIIINP in the insoluble matrix was further validated. Results: the insoluble matrices of AAAs contained at least 12 times more incompletely processed <b>type</b> <b>III</b> pN-collagen than AOD specimens (0. 74 % and 0. 061 %, respectively). Also, the soluble extracts of AAAs tended to contain more non-processed <b>type</b> <b>III</b> pN-collagen than free, properly cleaved aminoterminal propeptide. Conclusions: the larger amount of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> pN-collagen suggests an alteration in the metabolism of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> collagen in AAAs.

40|$|SummaryThe {{signals that}} {{determine}} whether axons are ensheathed or myelinated by Schwann cells {{have long been}} elusive. We now report that threshold levels of neuregulin- 1 (NRG 1) <b>type</b> <b>III</b> on axons determine their ensheathment fate. Ensheathed axons express low levels whereas myelinated fibers express high levels of NRG 1 <b>type</b> <b>III.</b> Sensory neurons from NRG 1 <b>type</b> <b>III</b> deficient mice are poorly ensheathed and fail to myelinate; lentiviral-mediated expression of NRG 1 <b>type</b> <b>III</b> rescues these defects. Expression also converts the normally unmyelinated axons of sympathetic neurons to myelination. Nerve fibers of mice haploinsufficient for NRG 1 <b>type</b> <b>III</b> are disproportionately unmyelinated, aberrantly ensheathed, and hypomyelinated, with reduced conduction velocities. <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> is the sole NRG 1 isoform retained at the axon surface and activates PI 3 -kinase, which is required for Schwann cell myelination. These results indicate that levels of NRG 1 <b>type</b> <b>III,</b> independent of axon diameter, provide a key instructive signal that determines the ensheathment fate of axons...|$|R

40|$|AbstractType III {{nitric oxide}} synthase (<b>type</b> <b>III</b> NOS), also known as endothelial cell {{nitric oxide synthase}} (eNOS or ecNOS or NOS- 3), is a constitutively expressed, calcium- and calmodulin-dependent, isoform of NOS. Its {{expression}} has been localized to endothelial cells and a subset of neurons in the brain. We report here that resident astrocytes of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) of mice express <b>type</b> <b>III</b> NOS. Following an experimental neurotropic viral infection, the expression of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> NOS on reactive astrocytes increases substantially, predominately in virally infected regions of the brain. This upregulation of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> NOS expression is also evident following cytokine treatmentin vitro. The intraperitoneal (i. p.) administration of IL- 12, a potent activator of IFN-γ and TNF-α production, results in a substantial increase in <b>type</b> <b>III</b> NOS immunoreactivity in astrocytes. Cytokine-mediated activation of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> NOS is observedin vitrofollowing exposure of a C 6 glioma cells, which constitutively express <b>type</b> <b>III</b> NOS, to IL- 12, IFN-γ, and TNF-α treatment. We conclude that astrocytes of the murine CNS express <b>type</b> <b>III</b> NOS, which may be positively regulated by a number of cytokines following viral infection. <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> NOS expression by astrocytes represents a novel source of nitric oxide in the brain. It may be important in regulating perfusion and maintaining the blood–brain barrier. Given the intimate association of astrocytes with endothelial cells and neurons, increased activity of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> NOS following viral infection may be beneficial in inhibition of viral infection in neighboring cells...|$|R
