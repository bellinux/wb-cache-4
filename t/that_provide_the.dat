5|$|The {{greatest}} threat to manta rays is overfishing. M. birostris is not evenly distributed over the oceans, but is concentrated in areas <b>that</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> food resources it requires, while M. alfredi is even more localized. Their distributions are thus fragmented, with little evidence of intermingling of subpopulations. Because of their long lifespans and low reproductive rate, overfishing can severely reduce local populations with little likelihood that individuals from elsewhere will replace them.|$|E
5|$|Completing stages {{allow the}} player to {{progress}} through the overworld map and to succeeding worlds. Each world features a final stage with a boss to defeat; the first seven worlds feature an airship controlled {{by one of the}} Koopalings, while the player battles Bowser in his castle in the eighth world. Other map icons include large boulders and locked doors that impede paths, and mini-games and bonus screens <b>that</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> player a chance to obtain special power-ups and additional lives. Power-ups obtained in these mini-games are stored in a reserve until activated by the player from the map screen.|$|E

5|$|Keeping {{track of}} the enemies' {{strengths}} and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players {{did not have to}} estimate what types of challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies. The game's HUD was revised eight times during development. As the inventory management of the original Mass Effect received criticism, designing a new inventory system for Mass Effect 2 {{was one of the main}} concerns during development. Ideally, the inventory needed to be able to handle a large number of characters with simplicity. Norman spent time examining various inventory systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large number of characters. Ultimately, the team opted to replaced it with a set of different systems <b>that</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> same functionality without any sort of management. This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away from someone else.|$|E
5|$|Kyra {{decides to}} {{reconnect}} with the other Halliwell sisters and devote her life to doing good. She begins by helping the newly resurrected Benjamin Turner, the father of Cole Turner (Julian McMahon), readjust to his new life. As they spend more time together, Kyra {{falls in love with}} Benjamin and they begin a romantic relationship. At the end of issue #18 ("Tribunal and Tribulations"), Prue kidnaps Kyra, along with Benjamin and the archai (a magical being capable of opening portals through reality) Tyler Michaels. Kyra witnesses Prue perform a sacrificial ritual forcing Tyler to open portals in the sky <b>that</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> Old Ones with access into the world. Kyra, Benjamin, and Tyler are later rescued by Paige. Following Prue's death and the closure of the portals, Kyra initially plans to leave, but Ben convinces her to help the students of Knox Academy, a school for magic. Prue, while {{under the influence of the}} Old One Heremus, had previously attacked the campus and turned the students and faculty into hosts for demons.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} cacti {{fall into}} only two genera, Pereskia and Maihuenia, and are rather different, which means any description of cacti {{as a whole}} must frequently make exceptions for them. Pereskia species superficially resemble other tropical forest trees. When mature, they have woody stems that may be covered with bark and long-lasting leaves <b>that</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> main means of photosynthesis. Their flowers may have superior ovaries (i.e., above the points of attachment of the sepals and petals), and areoles that produce further leaves. The two species of Maihuenia have small, globe-shaped bodies with prominent leaves at the top.|$|E

5|$|The {{selective}} breeding of crop plants often involves selection against the plant's intrinsic resistance strategies. This makes crop plant varieties particularly susceptible to pests unlike their wild relatives. In breeding for host-plant resistance, {{it is often}} the wild relatives <b>that</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> source of resistance genes. These genes are incorporated using conventional approaches to plant breeding, but have also been augmented by recombinant techniques, which allow introduction of genes from completely unrelated organisms. The most famous transgenic approach is the introduction of genes from the bacterial species, Bacillus thuringiensis, into plants. The bacterium produces proteins that, when ingested, kill lepidopteran caterpillars. The gene encoding for these highly toxic proteins, when introduced into the host plant genome, confers resistance against caterpillars, when the same toxic proteins are produced within the plant. This approach is controversial, however, due {{to the possibility of}} ecological and toxicological side effects.|$|E
