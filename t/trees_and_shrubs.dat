40|$|<b>Tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrub</b> {{integration}} {{has been}} promoted {{as a means of}} enhancing rural livelihoods through sustaining watershed provision of services and products, especially in Ethiopia. However, research to support this effort has been limited. This study was conducted in Borodo watershed in central Ethiopia, to identify constraints to the process of <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrub</b> integration in the watersheds. A household survey was conducted, supplemented with focus group discussions (FGDs), key informant interview and field observations. A total of 31 <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> 11 <b>shrub</b> species were identified in different niches in the watershed. The key constraints to <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrub</b> species integration included shortage of arable land, soil cracking, free grazing, lack of seedlings of desired species and water-logging. The main catalysts to the integration were availability of information on improved integration and cash for investment in the required activities, easy land certification and market opportunity for <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrub</b> products. The <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrub</b> growing niches preferred by farmers were homesteads (95. 5 %), gully sides (67. 4 %), stream sides (61. 8 %) road sides (60. 7 %), and crop land (12. 4 %). It is essential to address the factors that hinder <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrub</b> species integration at various growing niche so as to improve the availability of <b>tree</b> products <b>and</b> services. Moreover, the capacity of farmers should be upgraded through training and demonstration of best <b>tree</b> planting, management <b>and</b> utilisation practices...|$|R
40|$|Studies have {{documented}} many biophysical {{factors that are}} correlated with urban forest carbon storage. This urban forest function is also increasingly being promoted as a nature-based solution for cities. While urbanization affects both the structure and function of urban forest ecosystems, quantitative analyses of specific casual drivers of carbon storage in urban versus peri-urban forests are scarce. To address this lack of information, we used field data of random plots located along an urban to rural gradient in Shanghai, China, region-specific biomass equations, and path analysis of commonly studied urban forest socioeconomic and ecological drivers to analyze their effects on above ground tree carbon storage. An urbanization index was also developed to quantitatively differentiate urban from peri-urban sites along the transect. Results show that in both urban and peri-urban forests, percent <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrub</b> cover had a significant and positive effect on <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrub</b> carbon, but <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrub</b> density had an even greater effect. Further, <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrub</b> species diversity had no effects on carbon storage, while the effects of species composition on <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrub</b> carbon in urban forests was different from those in peri-urban areas. Peri-urban forests also exhibited a significant effect of percent <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrub</b> cover on <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrub</b> species diversity. This approach, using a path analysis of field and plot data and site-specific dendrometric and urbanization information, {{can be used to}} quantitatively identify little explored causal dependences between drivers and ecosystem services without relying exclusively on spatial land cover data often not available in developing countries...|$|R

The lesser kudu is mainly active at night and during the dawn, and seeks shelter in dense thickets just after the sunrise. The lesser kudu exhibits no territorial behaviour, and fights are rare. While females are gregarious, adult males prefer being solitary. No fixed breeding season is seen; births may occur {{at any time of}} the year. The lesser kudu inhabits dry, flat, and heavily forested regions.|$|E

Composed almost entirely of Dalradian limestone with interbedded black slate, Lismore has fertile soil and an abundance of <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrubs</b> including ash and sycamore.

In the tropics, known plant partners include Dipterocarpaceae, Fabaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Polygonaceae (Coccoloba), Sarcolaenaceae, and the gymnosperm Gnetum gnemon, and in the Southern Hemisphere, Nothofagaceae, Myrtaceae (Eucalyptus and Leptospermum), and Rhamnaceae (Pomaderris). Some Russulaceae are quite specialised in their ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, such as Lactarius and Russula species that only grow with Cistus shrubs in the Mediterranean basin.|$|E

5|$|In 1905 the USDA {{initiated}} {{its first}} large-scale biological control program, sending entomologists to Europe and Japan {{to look for}} natural enemies of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar dispar, and brown-tail moth, Euproctis chrysorrhoea, invasive pests of <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrubs.</b> As a result, nine parasitoids (solitary wasps) of gypsy moth, seven of brown-tail moth, and two predators of both moths became established in the USA. Although the gypsy moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies, the frequency, duration, and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful.

5|$|The diet of {{the bird}} can be varied. They eat various forms of foliage and other grassy {{material}} that they find on the ground on in <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrubs.</b> Dusky woodswallows have been seen eating termites, butterflies and other insects. They also eat nectar from flowers. One notable aspect of their feeding habits {{is the way they}} hunt flying insects, which is done by picking them up on their wing. They do, however, also eat their prey from the ground, and they often find inconspicuous places to perch while waiting for prey, such as utility lines and the like. They have also been observed engaging in kleptoparasitism, working as a group to rob a restless flycatcher of its prey. Kleptoparasitism is extremely unusual in passerine birds, as is cooperative kleptoparasitsim in general.|$|E
