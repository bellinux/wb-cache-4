25|$|The Universal Weapons Pylon is {{specific}} to the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopter, and provides two support racks for various weapon systems. <b>The</b> <b>racks,</b> with stores mounted, may be folded 180 degrees upward for rapid loading into the C-130 transport aircraft, though the connecting umbilicals must be disconnected to prevent damage.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Riggenbach <b>rack</b> {{system used}} a ladder rack, formed of steel {{channels}} connected by square rungs at regular intervals, {{to engage the}} pinion wheels of <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> engine. <b>The</b> rungs of <b>the</b> NZASM <b>rack</b> track were spaced 4 in apart. To ensure correct meshing of the gears when entering <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> section, engaging pieces of special section, 6 ft long and fitted with round-bar rungs, were hinged to each end of <b>the</b> <b>rack,</b> supported by a spiral spring underneath. When <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> engine made contact with the hinged section and the gear wheels did not mesh with <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> correctly, <b>the</b> engaging section would be pressed down until correct meshing was accomplished.|$|R
5000|$|The {{geometry}} of <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> system {{has a large}} impact {{on the construction of}} turnouts. If <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> is elevated above the running rails, {{there is no need to}} interrupt the running rails to allow passage of the driving pinions of the engines. Strub explicitly documented this in his U.S. patent. [...] Strub used a complex set of bell-cranks and push-rods linking the throw-rod for the points to the two throw-rods for <b>the</b> moving <b>rack</b> sections. One break in <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> was required to select between the two routes, and a second break was required where <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> rails cross <b>the</b> running rails. Turnouts for <b>the</b> Morgan <b>Rack</b> system were similar, with <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> elevated above <b>the</b> running rails. Most of the Morgan turnout patents included movable rack sections to avoid breaks in <b>the</b> <b>rack,</b> but because all Morgan locomotives had two linked drive pinions, there was no need for a continuous rack. So long as the breaks in <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> were shorter than the distance between the drive pinions on <b>the</b> locomotive, <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> rail could be interrupted wherever there was need to cross over a running rail.|$|R
50|$|A Dutch {{convention}} is {{to carry a}} passenger on <b>the</b> back <b>rack,</b> <b>the</b> passenger balancing side-saddle. <b>The</b> sturdy <b>rack</b> supports passenger weight, to carry a passenger and sustain a launch without collapsing. A standard strap assembly attaches cleanly to <b>the</b> <b>rack,</b> providing useful transport capability. There are standard notches for a strap assembly with 2 to 4 elastic straps. <b>The</b> <b>rack</b> is integrated into the bike design; the taillight is usually mounted {{on the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>rack.</b>|$|R
25|$|In late 1997, the Internet {{market was}} moving towards 56K technology. As {{one end of}} a 56k {{connection}} must be digital, <b>the</b> <b>racks</b> of modems found in every ISP became redundant overnight and expensive CBD-hosted equipment offered by Cisco, Ascend and Livingston became a requirement in order to survive in the marketplace. In 1998, competitive pressure from budget national providers, led by One.Tel, started to reach the Perth market.|$|E
25|$|Rack {{design on}} Panorama Elite, II and III {{contained}} window demisters. Those racks were joined to the cant rail and laminate {{was used as}} trim to connect the window edge to the rack. On Supreme the first versions used the same technique but <b>the</b> <b>racks</b> were swaddled in crash protection {{on each side of}} the passenger service unit that was fitted front to back. The service unit used were the same as the Panorama Elite, two controllable vents and a reading light with a rocker switch. The cushioning had a four pointed star engraved into it at intervals. From the Mark III <b>the</b> <b>racks</b> had flatter sides that had no connection to the cant rail. The demisters were located on the edge of the rack within a laminate strip. The PVC or maybe ABS material that coated the underneath of the rack was usually black. This was the final design of rack and saw Supreme through to the end of the series. Those racks utilized flatter service units with eyeball vents and a flat lens on the reading light.|$|E
25|$|This {{arrangement}} {{worked so}} well that nearly every autorack operating in the US was owned by a railroad, {{with only a few}} exceptions. Trailer Train became TTX Company in 1991; since then many railroads have themselves purchased the flat cars on which <b>the</b> <b>racks</b> were installed and TTX has itself expanded into purchasing and leasing out other railroad rolling stock. The development of enclosed autoracks also helped make several other innovative services work well.|$|E
50|$|Testing <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> in {{its place}} allows it to fall until the tail rests on the lowest step of the snail. The hook of <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> should then hold <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> {{so that there are}} twelve teeth {{gathered}} up. Trying it on the highest step of the snail, should catch <b>the</b> first <b>rack</b> tooth. This leaves only one to be gathered up. If the clock strikes thirteen when on the lowest step and two when on the highest, it shows that the end of <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> tail is a little too far off from the snail and must be set a little closer. If on the other hand the snail strikes the right number when on the lowest step and two when on the highest, then the proportion between <b>the</b> snail and <b>rack</b> is wrong. <b>The</b> <b>rack</b> travel is too great for <b>the</b> <b>rack.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Heavy {{equipment}} or equipment which is commonly accessed for servicing, for which attaching or detaching at all four corners simultaneously would pose a problem, {{is often not}} mounted directly onto <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> but instead is mounted via rails (or slides). A pair of rails is mounted directly onto <b>the</b> <b>rack,</b> and <b>the</b> equipment then slides into <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> along <b>the</b> rails, which support it. When in place, the equipment may also then be bolted to <b>the</b> <b>rack.</b> <b>The</b> rails may {{also be able to}} fully support the equipment in a position where it has been slid clear of the rack; this is useful for inspection or maintenance of equipment which will then be slid back into <b>the</b> <b>rack.</b> [...] Some rack slides even include a tilt mechanism allowing easy access to the top or bottom of rack mounted equipment when it is fully extended from <b>the</b> <b>rack.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rack</b> {{railway section}} near Mount Morgan was closed in 1952 after a {{conventional}} line {{was built to}} bypass it, with grades of 1 in 50 (2%). This occurred because <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> locomotives were due for replacement and <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> section was becoming a bottleneck in the haulage of coal from Callide Coalfields.|$|R
25|$|The USAAF later ordered 310 P-51As, {{which were}} {{essentially}} A-36s without the dive-brakes and nose mounted weapons, leaving an armament of four wing-mounted 0.50in (12.7mm) Browning machine guns. An Allison V-1710-81 1,200hp (895kW) was fitted {{and used the}} same radiator and air intake as the A-36A. The P-51A was still fitted with bomb racks {{although it was not}} intended to be used primarily as a fighter-bomber and <b>the</b> <b>racks</b> were mainly used to carry drop tanks.|$|E
25|$|The new Nova Bus LFS {{articulated}} buses came factory-equipped with bike racks, {{as do the}} non-articulated LFS buses entering service in 2015. These racks were sealed in October 2014 by order of the Ministry of Labour, due to concerns about bikes on <b>the</b> <b>racks</b> obscuring the drivers' view. In May 2015, the slot closer to the bus was authorised for use. The other is sealed off with metal panels, and the retention hooks have been removed. Once the first slot is full, cyclists may bring their bikes inside the articulated bus during off-peak hours, at the driver's discretion.|$|E
25|$|Most {{practical}} mechanical analog computers of {{any significant}} complexity used rotating shafts to carry variables from one mechanism to another. Cables and pulleys {{were used in}} a Fourier synthesizer, a tide-predicting machine, which summed the individual harmonic components. Another category, not nearly as well known, used rotating shafts only for input and output, with precision racks and pinions. <b>The</b> <b>racks</b> were connected to linkages that performed the computation. At least one US Naval sonar fire control computer of the later 1950s, made by Librascope, was of this type, as was the principal computer in the Mk. 56 Gun Fire Control System.|$|E

5000|$|Following his {{stint as}} Platoon Leader and the {{subsequent}} XO for H Co, Baker began working with the Armor and Engineering Board to draft blueprints of a revolutionary new prototype <b>rack.</b> <b>The</b> advantages of <b>the</b> <b>rack's</b> unique [...] "quick disconnect" [...] design featured the use of standard quick disconnect pins already in use as fasteners on the tank's armored skirts. These pins enabled the easy removal of <b>the</b> bustle <b>rack</b> should it become damaged during combat or training operations. Removing the handful of lower mounting pins allowed <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> to be [...] "pivoted" [...] onto the blowout panels located on top and {{to the rear of}} the turret. Pivoting <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> eliminated interference between <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> and <b>the</b> back deck panel, providing unobstructed access to the tank's power plant during maintenance operations. <b>The</b> <b>rack</b> became widely known around the Army's Armor community as [...] "The Baker Bustle". <b>The</b> <b>rack</b> quickly gained popularity among M1 tankers and the fielded design, though slightly modified by General Dynamics Land Systems, is still <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> seen on M1A1 tanks in combat today, though as you can see from the inset photo, some units have modified their M1's with an extended framework added to <b>the</b> standard bustle <b>rack</b> for additional stowage capacity.

25|$|The entire railway is {{fitted with}} <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> rail. On sidings {{and around the}} yard at Llanberis it {{comprises}} a single rack bar, but on the running line, and through all the loops up <b>the</b> mountain, two <b>rack</b> bars are used, mounted {{side by side with}} their teeth staggered by half a pitch. This {{is one of the major}} features of the Abt system, and helps to reduce the shock of the pinions running along <b>the</b> <b>rack.</b> It also ensures the pinion maintains continuous contact with <b>the</b> <b>rack.</b> <b>The</b> joints between <b>rack</b> bars are also staggered and align with the sleepers – each sleeper supports <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> rail as well as the running rails.|$|R
25|$|Although railroads {{were just}} {{beginning}} to see the advantages that autoracks delivered in the 1960s, most North American railroads were reluctant to invest in such specially built equipment. The Trailer Train Company, organized by the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1955, stepped in to ease the railroads' financial burden a bit. Trailer Train purchased the flat cars from the rail car manufacturers, and the railroads that wanted to operate autoracks, purchased <b>the</b> <b>racks</b> that were installed on those flat cars. Such cars were easily spotted at trackside due to the reporting marks identifying Trailer Train on the flat car portion of the car and the railroad's logo (usually much larger) in the upper portion of the rack.|$|E
25|$|The Panorama Elite II range {{built on}} the success of the Panorama I and Panorama Elite. The front grill was squared up {{although}} it still used the same twin headlight layout. The first bay on the near side was tidied up so the top of the window was in line with all the other side windows. Parcel racks were redesigned so the supply of fresh air and light output was more readily available. The service units were now mounted front to back instead of side to side and were much slimmer to maximize on headroom when leaving the seats. Crash padding was provided along the inner side of <b>the</b> <b>racks</b> in the form of black PVC squares filled with padding. The dashboard was again improved as was the front cabinet. The rear of the vehicle still used the soup plates from the previous range.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of The new Panorama Elite {{was to the}} usual high standard that everyone had come to expect from a leading coachbuilder like Plaxton. It made more use of laminate than before but this was tastefully specified & well balanced. The interior skirt panels, racks and front cabinet made extensive use of this easily worked & easy to maintain material. The analogue clock in the front dome was flanked either side by small square controllable air vents. The dashboard was improved and made use of a panel of rocker switches {{in front of the}} driver with each switch designation lighting for night time operation. Previous dashboards hid the switches in places inaccessible whilst moving. Ventilation was again improved though using the same design of moulded air output & light assembly as {{the final version of the}} Panorama I. <b>The</b> <b>racks</b> were trimmed with laminate instead of using vinyl like material from the previous design.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{principle}} behind <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> lock is as follows: To begin, skis are placed in <b>the</b> ski <b>rack,</b> and a pin is used to fix them into place so they cannot be removed. <b>The</b> <b>rack</b> lock then ensures that the pin cannot be removed by anyone other than <b>the</b> owner. <b>Rack</b> locks are always fastened with a key.|$|R
50|$|To {{compensate}} for tyre wear on the coupled driving wheels, <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> axle bearings could be adjusted vertically, while <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> wheel teeth were of involute form to ensure correct action between adjustments. The inner cranks {{were of the}} disk type, with triangular circumferential grooves to take the cast-iron brake blocks of <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> engine hand brake.|$|R
50|$|The {{release lever}} (L) holds <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> (M) {{up when the}} clock is not striking. On the shaft of the minute hand (not shown), which rotates once per hour, there is a {{projection}}. As the change of the hour approaches, this projection slowly lifts the release lever, allowing <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> to fall until its point rests on the snail (N). <b>The</b> amount <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> can fall, and thus the number of strikes, {{is determined by the}} position of the snail. Exactly on the hour the striking train (G, H, K) is released and begins to turn. As it turns, the pins (G) repeatedly lift the hammer (F) and allow it to drop, ringing the gong (E). The gear ratios are arranged so that the gear wheel (H) makes one revolution each strike. A small pin (S) on this wheel engages <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> teeth, lifting <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> up by one tooth each turn. When <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> reaches <b>the</b> end of its teeth it stops the striking train from turning (using a mechanism not shown in the diagram, {{in such a way that}} gear (H) is held stationary with the pin (S) not engaging <b>the</b> <b>rack,</b> so that <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> is able to fall freely again on the next hour). So the number of strikes is equal to the number of teeth of <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> which are used, which depends on the position of the snail.|$|R
25|$|A few metres {{behind the}} Kipfenbrücke the second rack section begins. The next {{part of the}} route, through the Kipfenschlucht, is {{considered}} to be the most scenic portion of the entire line. The railway and the Vispa run here in a most confined space, adjacent to each other. This whole section has been repeatedly damaged by flooding and avalanches, sometimes severely. To avoid further damage, the Vispa has therefore been increasingly regulated {{since the end of the}} 19th century, and the line formation protected by solid masonry. In the middle of the gorge, the fully automatic crossing point at Kipferwald was set up in 1999. The upper end of the Kipfenschlucht is marked by the Sellibrücke, on which the Vispa is crossed for the third time. Shortly thereafter, <b>the</b> <b>racks</b> and the formation travel along the right side of the widening valley to St. Niklaus, at 1126 metres above sea level. Since Stalden, a total of 327 m in altitude have been climbed.|$|E
25|$|Flight day six {{was devoted}} to {{transfer}} operations, and the two crews worked through the morning to complete all the rack transfers. Magnus and Chamitoff successfully installed the two crew quarters racks into the Harmony node, and installed a rack with equipment {{to be returned to}} Earth into the MPLM. During the Mission Status briefing, Lead ISS Flight Director Ginger Kerrick noted that all <b>the</b> <b>racks</b> were now on station, and about 25% of the cargo transfers had been completed, which was slightly ahead of schedule. The two crews also began working on activating the Water Recovery System, so that samples of water from two areas could be taken and returned to Earth with Endeavour. The system's initial checkout was initiated, and water samples would be taken after several days of operation. Later in the day, the two crews reviewed procedures for the mission's second EVA, and Stefanyshyn-Piper and Kimbrough would sleep in the station's airlock as part of the pre-EVA campout procedure.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} evidences {{that have been}} {{discovered}} {{in the last decade}} about the Hoko River Community. As archeologists are able to excavate the location and sites surround this river, more information can be gathered about the people that lived along this beautiful river banks. As mentioned in the previous passage, the wet sites provided excellent preservation for artifacts. The rock shelter and the wet sites created extension of the preservation times of these artifacts and items found alongside the river. Evidence shows that Halibut and Cod were the main species fished in this region. Hoko River community fished Halibut and Cod, the preservation of these types of fish was needed to make through the off-season months when fish was scarce. Wooden drying racks were found during one of the excavation sites along the river. <b>The</b> <b>racks</b> provided safe drying area where fish were dried in the sun. This made the preservation of the fish to be extended. Hooks, floats, and cordage were also found along the river that suggests fishing was main source of living for Hoko River Community. This also suggests that there was a social ranking was present during this time.|$|E
