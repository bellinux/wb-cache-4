25|$|Golf, {{known in}} Japan as , is a golf video game that was {{released}} {{within months of}} the Virtual Boy console's launch. Golf was developed and published by T Soft in Japan and published by Nintendo in North America. It was directed by Tadashi Nakatsuji and its sound specialist was Ken Kojima. The game uses standard golf rules and {{is set in the}} fictional 18-hole Papillion Golf & Country Club. Hazards include water, sand traps, trees, and deep rough grass, and players can choose their club and various aspects of the club's swing, including speed, direction, stance, swing power, and the ball impact point. The direction the ball will go in is determined by these <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as the speed and direction of the wind. It is displayed in the Virtual Boy's standard red and black color scheme with 3D effects by use of a 3D processor. It was met with critical praise for its controls and physics and mixed reviews for its graphics. Nintendo Power called it the third best Virtual Boy release of its year.|$|E

500|$|Cobb went on {{to write}} the first single-author book in {{environmental}} ethics, Is It Too Late? A Theology of Ecology, in 1971. [...] In the book, he argued for an ecological worldview that acknowledges the continuity between human beings and other living <b>things,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as their mutual dependence. [...] He also proposed that Christianity specifically needed to appropriate knowledge from the biological sciences in order to undercut its anthropocentrism (human-centeredness) and devaluation of the non-human world.|$|E

Previsualization was handled by The Third Floor. All vendors worked on the common magical elements (mandalas, magical runes shields, whips, stalks and aerial 'lily pads', and portals). Visual effects supervisor Stephane Ceretti, who also worked on Guardians of the Galaxy, explained {{the similarities and differences}} between the two films, saying, [...] "there's some resemblance in {{some of the things that}} we've done. In the same way, it's a totally different world. In , it's more sci-fi oriented and crazy colors. More of a comedy kind of take on <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> This one is a little bit more serious. It's also a little bit more trippy. We use very different techniques, actually. Guardians was also for us a huge animation film. This one was less of it. This one was more about the environments and effects".|$|E

Following the release of The Avalanche, Stevens expressed a dissatisfaction with his music, stating in an interview with Pitchfork in 2006: [...] "I'm getting tired of my voice. I'm getting tired of ... the banjo. I'm getting tired of ... the trumpet". In 2009 Stevens admitted that his Fifty States Project—an attempt to write an album for each of the 50 U.S. States—had been a [...] "promotional gimmick" [...] and not something that he had seriously intended to complete. In the same year he released The BQE, an orchestral suite accompanying a home-made film dedicated to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. In an interview with BeatRoute Magazine in 2010, Stevens stated [...] " [...] kinda sabotaged the mechanical way of approaching my music, which was basically narrative long-form. It really opened things up for me. It also confused <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> I don’t think I ever really fully recovered from that process". On August 20, 2010, without prior announcement, Stevens released the EP All Delighted People, and less than one week later, announced The Age of Adz to be released on October 12.|$|E

2500|$|Studies by Michael Conway et al., David Wagner and Joseph Berger, John Williams and Deborah Best, and Susan Fiske et al. found {{widely shared}} {{cultural}} beliefs {{that men are}} more socially valued and more competent than women at most <b>things,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as specific assumptions that men are better at some particular tasks (e.g., math, mechanical tasks) while women are better at others (e.g., nurturing tasks). Shelley Correll, Michael Lovaglia, Margaret Shih et al., and Claude Steele show that these gender status beliefs affect the assessments people make of their own competence at career-relevant tasks. Correll found that specific stereotypes (e.g., women have lower mathematical ability) affect women's and men's perceptions of their abilities (e.g., in math and science) such that men assess their own task ability higher than women performing at the same level. These [...] "biased self-assessments" [...] shape men and women's educational and career decisions.|$|E

According to Flămând's 1985 essay, Baconsky's rejection of [...] "consumerism" [...] and the West was decisive, and culminated in a virulent decision of what Baconsky {{is known to have}} called [...] "the occidental pharaoh". Braga also writes that, in both Cadavre în vid and Corabia lui Sebastian, Baconsky depicts his own version of a [...] "crisis of the West" [...] (the Abendland forming a setting of one poem), which he believed may have referenced Oswald Spengler's similar verdict (see The Decline of the West). Diana Câmpan noted the poems' dystopian imagery: [...] "The Abendland is [...] an eerie Leviathan-like corpus, with attributes defining for humanity's decrepitude, a surrogate, anti-utopian citadel, handled in accordance with the laws of decline which grind the elites as well as the masses, the <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> their reflection".
