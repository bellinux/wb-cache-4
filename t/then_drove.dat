5|$|Following Haraldr Guðrøðarson's takeover, {{the chronicle}} records that he <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> {{out all of}} the chiefs and nobles of the old regime who had been {{supporters}} of the deceased Haraldr Óláfsson, and then replaced them with men whom the latter had previously exiled.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly created}} Army Group Vistula, {{under the command}} of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, {{attempted}} a counter-attack, but this had failed by 24 February. The Red Army <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> on to Pomerania, clearing the right bank of the Oder River, thereby reaching into Silesia.|$|E
5|$|A daring {{escape from}} Auschwitz was staged on 20 June 1942 by four Polish prisoners: Eugeniusz Bendera (auto {{mechanic}} at the camp), Kazimierz Piechowski, Stanisław Gustaw Jaster, and Józef Lempart. After {{breaking into a}} warehouse, the four dressed {{as members of the}} SS-Totenkopfverbände (the SS units responsible for concentration camps), armed themselves, and stole an SS staff car, which they <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> unchallenged through the main gate.|$|E
60|$|They {{laid the}} {{flowers on the}} fresh earth, even the white roses, and <b>then</b> they <b>drove</b> back to the city.|$|R
6000|$|... "The men hesitated, and I {{ran past}} them {{and climbed into}} the cart, and threw myself down by Mysa, and <b>then</b> they <b>drove</b> off." ...|$|R
60|$|And <b>then</b> he <b>drove</b> on, rejoiced at {{the thought}} that even while his friend was sick, he could remove one cause of trouble from him.|$|R
5|$|In July 1930 Troy Middleton {{stopped at}} his new {{headquarters}} at Fort McPherson in Atlanta, <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> west {{with his family to}} Baton Rouge, Louisiana which would become the family home for many years. Major Middleton became the Commandant of cadets at LSU, along with being the professor of military science.|$|E
5|$|Acoli <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> the car (a white Pontiac LeMans with Vermont license plates)—which {{contained}} Assata Shakur, who was wounded, and Zayd Shakur, who {{was dead}} or dying— down the road. The vehicle was chased by three patrol {{cars and the}} booths down the turnpike were alerted. Acoli then exited the car and, after being ordered to halt by a trooper, fled into the woods as the trooper emptied his gun. Assata Shakur then walked towards the trooper with her bloodied arms raised in surrender. Acoli was captured after a 36-hour manhunt—involving 400 people, state police helicopters, and bloodhounds. Zayd Shakur's {{body was found in}} a nearby gully along the road.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc heeded {{the advice}} {{he was given}} by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as many {{soldiers}} as possible. He broke the Vietminh blockade around Saigon, <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> through the Mekong delta and up into the highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first priority was {{getting rid of the}} Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the conflict.|$|E
6000|$|... "No they ain't;--they're all wrong." [...] And <b>then</b> he <b>drove</b> {{down the}} avenue to Spoon Hall {{as quickly as}} he could make the horses trot.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> Edie <b>drove</b> {{herself back}} to Peveril Court, feeling that only Evan Meredith knew besides; {{and she could}} surely count at least on Evan's honour.|$|R
60|$|They {{sat down}} and waited until the farmer brought a wagon to the door, and <b>then</b> they <b>drove</b> away through the {{stinging}} cold with their prisoner.|$|R
5|$|Nelson {{then had}} stints working for KDNT in Denton, Texas, KCUL and KCNC in Fort Worth, Texas, where he hosted The Western Express, taught Sunday school {{and he played}} in nightclubs. He then {{decided to move to}} San Diego. He was unable to find a job, and decided to go to Portland, Oregon, where his mother lived. Nelson tried to hitchhike, but after nobody picked him up, he slept in a ditch. He then found a nearby {{railroad}} yard and boarded a freight train that left him in Eugene. A truck driver <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> Nelson to a bus station and loaned him $10 for a ticket to reach Portland.|$|E
5|$|One {{alternative}} was the turbo-electric drive where the steam turbine generated electrical power which <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> the propellers. This was particularly favoured by the US Navy, which {{used it for}} all dreadnoughts from late 1915–1922. The advantages of this method were its low cost, the opportunity for very close underwater compartmentalization, and good astern performance. The disadvantages were that the machinery was heavy and vulnerable to battle damage, particularly the effects of flooding on the electrics.|$|E
5|$|The {{match that}} {{followed}} was a Fatal 4-Way Match for the WWE Women's Championship, with Victoria defending the title against Trish Stratus, Lita, and Gail Kim. The {{start of the}} match saw Victoria and Lita double team Stratus, however, Stratus avoided the assault, as she rolled out of the ring. Lita and Victoria went on to double team Kim, however, Stratus pulled Lita out of the ring, afterward Victoria performed a moonsault and landed on Kim's torso. Lita <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> Kim's head into the mat. Stratus {{then went on to}} use a roll up on Lita to gain a pinfall victory, becoming Women's champion for a fifth time.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> Bob <b>drove</b> {{on toward}} the Simpson place, Jim and Dick having preceded the others, for they {{had no desire to}} meet a constable even in a {{friendly}} way.|$|R
60|$|The old man didn't {{take any}} notice of 'im. He dressed 'imself up very slow and careful in Peter's clothes, and <b>then</b> 'e <b>drove</b> 'em nearly crazy by wasting time making 'is bed.|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of his junior year {{beginning}} in September 1928, Richard's parents permitted him to transfer to Whittier High School. At Whittier High, Nixon suffered his first electoral defeat, for student body president. He often rose at 4a.m., to drive the family truck into Los Angeles and purchase vegetables at the market. He <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> to the store to wash and display them, before going to school. Harold had been diagnosed with tuberculosis the previous year; when their mother took him to Arizona in the hopes of improving his health, the demands on Richard increased, causing him to give up football. Nevertheless, Richard graduated from Whittier High third in his class of 207students.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the rain-affected practice and qualifying sessions, the track was dry {{for the duration of}} the race. All of the drivers except Jenson Button, Jarno Trulli and the two Red Bull drivers started on the softer option tyre. The first lap was eventful: Alonso started better than polesitter Massa and was able to take the inside line into turn one and gain the lead. Hamilton passed Räikkönen for third into the first corner, <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> round the outside of Massa into turn two to take second place. Meanwhile, the suspension on Adrian Sutil's Spyker failed at turn four, causing it to collide with Button's Honda and retire from the race. Button continued after making an early pitstop to repair the damage. Liuzzi and Sato also collided at turn four, causing Liuzzi to pit for a new front wing. After the race the drivers blamed each other for the incident.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wild}} card playoffs, the Giants built a 38–14 3rd-quarter lead against San Francisco. However, the 49ers rallied, scoring a field goal, and three touchdowns to take a 39–38 lead with a minute left in the game. Collins <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> the Giants down to the 49ers 23-yard line with six seconds left, setting up a {{potential}} game winning 41-yard field goal attempt for Matt Bryant. On the final play of the game, 40-year-old long snapper Trey Junkin — {{who had just been}} signed for this playoff game — snapped the ball low, and punter Matt Allen could not spot the ball properly for the attempt. Allen picked the ball up and threw an unsuccessful pass downfield to offensive lineman Rich Seubert as time expired, and the Giants lost 39–38.|$|E
60|$|This thrust at her father's simple vanity in her {{made him}} laugh; and <b>then</b> they <b>drove</b> away, and Penelope shut the door, and went upstairs with her lips firmly {{shutting}} in a sob.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> {{the foreman}} <b>drove</b> away, and Mr. Hopkins was left greatly puzzled.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{told her}} his name, and where he lived, so that she might find him if need be, and <b>then</b> he <b>drove</b> away in the empty wagon before Grandma Horner had half {{finished}} thanking him.|$|R
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 7November 1974, the children's nanny, Sandra Rivett, was bludgeoned {{to death in the}} {{basement}} of the Lucan family home. Lady Lucan was also attacked; she later identified Lucan as her assailant. As the police began their murder investigation, Lucan telephoned his mother, asking her to collect the children, and <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> a borrowed Ford Corsair to a friend's house in Uckfield, East Sussex. Hours later, he left the property and vanished without trace. The car was found abandoned in Newhaven, its interior stained with blood and its boot containing a piece of bandaged lead pipe similar to one found at the crime scene. A warrant for Lucan's arrest was issued a few days later, and in his absence the inquest into Rivett's death named him as her murderer, the last occasion in Britain a coroner's court did so.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles' last {{concert was}} at Candlestick Park, San Francisco, on 29 August 1966, but Evans {{continued}} {{to work for them}} in the studio, and to run errands. After recording Revolver in 1966, McCartney went by himself on holiday to France, but asked to meet Evans in Bordeaux, at the Grosse Horloge church (on the corner of cours Victor Hugo and rue St. James). At exactly the pre-arranged time of one o'clock, Evans was standing under the church clock when McCartney arrived. They <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> to Madrid together, but after feeling bored, McCartney phoned Epstein's office in London and asked to be booked on a safari holiday in Kenya. When they arrived they visited the Amboseli Reserve at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro, and also stayed at the exclusive Treetops Hotel, where the rooms are built on the branches of trees.|$|E
5|$|The Ole Miss lead only {{lasted for}} fifteen seconds, as Christion Jones scored a {{touchdown}} on the kickoff that ensued with his 99-yard return {{that gave the}} Crimson Tide a 13–7 lead. On the Rebels' next possession, Bo Wallace threw an interception to Dee Milliner, and four plays later AJ McCarron threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Amari Cooper that extended the Alabama lead to 20–7. On their next drive, Ole Miss was intercepted by the Crimson Tide on two separate occasions. First Robert Lester intercepted a Bo Wallace pass that he subsequently fumbled and was recovered by Scott, and then two plays later Randall Mackey threw an interception to Deion Belue at the Alabama 32-yard line. The Crimson Tide <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> 68 yards and took a 27–7 halftime lead after McCarron threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Cooper.|$|E
60|$|Pa {{heard and}} promised to heed, with every {{intention}} of keeping his promise. <b>Then</b> he <b>drove</b> away joyfully. On any other occasion Ma {{would have been a}} welcome companion. But she certainly spoiled the flavour of an auction.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Unity Sallet agreed, and {{lay down}} at {{the back end of}} the waggon, and Tony covered her over, so that the waggon seemed to be empty but for the loose tarpaulin; and <b>then</b> he <b>drove</b> on to meet Milly.|$|R
60|$|This {{idea was}} {{followed}} out, the boys spending {{the best part}} of an hour in going around Coburntown. <b>Then</b> they <b>drove</b> back to Crumville, and there Dave visited some other establishments with which he was in the habit of doing business.|$|R
5|$|The Sooners had {{the ball}} first in overtime, with Adrian Peterson scoring on their first play. Boise State <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> the ball toward the goal line, but faced fourth-and-two from the five yard line. They then sent quarterback Jared Zabransky into motion and snapped to backup wide {{receiver}} Vinny Peretta, who ran an option pass and found Derek Schouman in the end zone. The Broncos chose {{to go for the}} two-point conversion and the win instead of kicking for the tie. They then ran a Statue of Liberty play, with Zabransky faking a pass to the right side and handing the ball behind his back to Ian Johnson, who ran left and entered the end zone untouched, giving the Broncos a stunning 4342 win.|$|E
5|$|The Vikings won {{the coin}} toss and started {{overtime}} with {{possession of the}} football on their own 29-yard line, but managed to convert only one first down and punted to Atlanta. The Falcons drove to their own 41-yard line before being stopped on 3rd down, and they punted the ball back to Vikings. On the ensuing drive, Cunningham attempted a deep pass to Moss that was narrowly broken up by Eugene Robinson; had the pass been completed, it most likely {{would have resulted in}} a touchdown and victory for the Vikings. Instead, the Vikings had to punt on 4th down again. The Falcons <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> to the Vikings' 21-yard line, where Morten Andersen converted a 38-yard field goal for the win.|$|E
5|$|The first LRP patrol began {{during the}} Italian {{invasion}} of Egypt. 'W' Patrol commanded by Captain Mitford {{set out on}} 15 September 1940 {{to carry out a}} reconnaissance of Kufra and Uweinat. Finding no trace of the Italians, they turned south and attacked fuel dumps, aircraft and an Italian convoy carrying supplies to Kufra. 'T' Patrol, commanded by Captain Clayton, reconnoitred the main route between Kufra and Uweinat, <b>then</b> <b>drove</b> south to meet up with 'W' Patrol; both units returned to base, having captured two Italian trucks and official mail. The Italian response to these raids was to reduce their front line forces and increase the number of troops garrisoning the area from 2,900 men in September to 5,500 by November 1940.|$|E
50|$|Roberts and Bond won the 1970 Rothmans 12 Hour at Surfers Paradise, also in an HDT Monaro GTS350. <b>Then</b> Roberts <b>drove</b> a Holden Torana sports sedan {{which was}} used as a {{prototype}} for the Torana GTR XU-1 which debuted later in the year.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} very pleased," [...] Matravers answered. [...] "May I {{come in with}} you?" [...] Fergusson lingered {{for a moment or}} two at the {{carriage}} door, and <b>then</b> they <b>drove</b> off. Berenice, with a little sigh, leaned back amongst the cushions.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{there is}} no blame to you in it;--nor is there blame to me. But {{it would have been}} better for us both had we {{remained}} away." [...] <b>Then</b> he <b>drove</b> on in silence, and did not speak another word till they reached home.|$|R
