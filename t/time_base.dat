25|$|The X-axis of {{the system}} was fed by a <b>time</b> <b>base</b> {{generator}} that pulled the beam {{from left to right}} across the screen. Normally a <b>time</b> <b>base</b> is triggered to start its sweep as soon as the signal from the transmitter is seen, but as noted above, this would not provide the accuracy required for this role. Instead, the <b>time</b> <b>base</b> was set to span the screen at a much faster rate, representing only a portion of the signal's overall flight time. Triggering the <b>time</b> <b>base</b> was accomplished using a very accurate oil-filled potentiometer which exponentially increased the charge in a capacitor bank until it reached a trigger value. A very complex grounding system was needed to ensure the accuracy of the voltages leaving the potentiometer system, as any stray voltages could overwhelm the signal.|$|E
25|$|The bearing {{receiver}} {{was otherwise}} {{identical to the}} range version, and fed into the CRT in the same fashion. A slower <b>time</b> <b>base</b> generator was used, triggered by the same signal as the first, but set to scan much more slowly. In this case the <b>time</b> <b>base</b> {{was not used to}} measure range, and the horizontal location of the blip was not important. Instead, the <b>time</b> <b>base</b> was used simply to help ensure the bearing operator was looking at the same target as the range operator - the signal of interest would be somewhere close to centred.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{position}} of the blip is synchronised to the angle of the <b>time</b> <b>base,</b> and the <b>time</b> <b>base</b> to the dish, the angle of the arc relative to the centre indicated the angle to the target; a target above and {{to the right of the}} fighter would produce an arc above and to the right of the centre of the display.|$|E

30|$|<b>Time</b> <b>based</b> {{features}}: <b>Time</b> <b>based</b> {{features were}} {{calculated from the}} pre-processed signal directly. Different statistics such as average, maximum, standard deviation etc. of the signal were used as time-based features (see Table  2).|$|R
25|$|CH-type radar {{displays}} use a <b>time</b> <b>base</b> generator {{to produce}} a smoothly varying voltage that is fed {{to one of the}} inputs of a cathode ray tube (CRT). The <b>time</b> <b>base</b> is calibrated to move the CRT dot across the screen in the same time that echoes would be returned from objects at the radar's maximum range. The dot moves so rapidly that it looks like a solid line. The return signal is amplified and then sent into the CRT's other channel, causing the spot to deflect away from the straight line being created by the <b>time</b> <b>base.</b> For small objects, like aircraft, the deflection causes a small blip to appear on the display. The range to the target can be measured by comparing the location of the blip to a calibrated scale on the display.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{altitude}} of the beacon was known, on the ground, the angular display was not needed. Instead, a switch was flipped {{by a small}} cam on the scanner as it passed the 12 and 6 o'clock positions in its rotation pattern, causing the receiver output to be inverted. The angular scanning was turned off and the <b>time</b> <b>base</b> re-positioned {{at the bottom of}} the screen. Received signals caused the <b>time</b> <b>base</b> to move to the left or right depending on where the dish was pointed at the time the signal was received.|$|E
25|$|When {{the scanner}} was turned on it rotated the dish {{clockwise}} through a complete circle 17 times a second. The <b>time</b> <b>base</b> ran at 2500pps, which means {{there are about}} 147 pulses for every rotation, or about one pulse every 2.5 degrees. The <b>time</b> <b>base</b> was set to start drawing about 0.5cm from {{the centre of the}} tube, so if the brightness is turned all the way up with the scanner running, the result would be a series of closely spaced radial lines forming a sort of sunburst pattern with an empty area in the centre.|$|E

25|$|This {{left the}} receiver, <b>time</b> <b>base</b> {{system and the}} display inside the {{aircraft}} cabin. There was ample room for this in the Beaufighter where the radar operator sat {{at the back of}} the fuselage. In the Mosquito, the radar operator sat to the right and slightly behind the pilot. The main entry door was located on the left side of the fuselage, just in front of the radar operator. With the radar installed, this left almost no room to reach the door, so the <b>time</b> <b>base</b> circuitry was mounted on rails that allowed it to be slid up and forward, out of the way of the door. Among the parts inside the aircraft were the Type 73 display and the TR.3152 Lucero.|$|E
25|$|As Mk. I {{arrived in}} the field, a number of {{improvements}} in the basic electronics were introduced. These were collected together to form the Mk. I* version. The differences between the Mk. I and Mk. I* were primarily in details. It was found that in certain orientations of the transmitter and receiver, the small antenna used to trigger the <b>time</b> <b>base</b> would see too small a signal to work. This {{was replaced by a}} cable between the two cabins, which was known as cable locking. Certain details of the RF stages on the receiver improved signal-to-noise ratio, a voltage regulator was added to correct for differences in generators, and a new system was introduced that replaced the complex grounding system for the potentiometer with an electronic version. A more major change was the introduction of anti-jamming features.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, the spiral-can {{system was}} {{essentially}} a rotating version of a conventional A-scope display. In the A-scope, a <b>time</b> <b>base</b> generator pulls the CRT beam across the screen horizontally, and blips indicate the range to the target along the line the radar is currently pointed. For spiral-scan the only difference was that the line was no longer always horizontal, but was rotating around {{the face of the}} display at the same speed as the dish. Blips on the screen now indicated two values, the angle of the target relative to the centreline, and the range to the target represented by the distance from the centre. What was lost in this display was a direct indication of magnitude of the angle from the centre; a blip to the upper right indicated the target was in that direction but did not directly indicate if it was five, ten or twenty degrees off.|$|E

25|$|At that point, {{measurement}} starts. The operator {{switches to}} sweep speed 5, which returns to a display with two separated traces, with the signals inverted and running {{at a lower}} sweep speed so that multiple repetitions of the signal appear on the traces. Mixed into the signal is an electronic scale produced in a <b>time</b> <b>base</b> generator, causing {{a series of small}} pips to appear over the now-inverted original signals. At the 5 setting, the pips on the scale represent differences of 10 microseconds, and the operator measures the distance between positions. This is repeated for setting 6 at 50 microseconds, and again at setting 7 at 500 microseconds. The difference as measured at each of these settings is then added up to produce the total delay between the two signals. This entire procedure was then repeated for the second master-slave set, often the second set of the same chain but not always.|$|E
25|$|Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond {{was formed}} in April 1952 to replace the former Station Headquarters, along with a {{subordinate}} unit, Base Squadron Richmond, for the day-to-day running of the establishment. The base was evacuated in February 1956 due {{to the threat of}} rising floodwaters nearby, the only time in its history that flooding in the Hawkesbury region became serious enough to warrant such action. In 1958–59, No.36 Squadron began operating its first C-130 Hercules heavy transports, which were augmented by No.38 Squadron's DHC-4 Caribou tactical transports in 1964. No.86 Wing was disbanded in August that year, but reformed in February 1987, under the newly established Headquarters Air Lift Group that replaced the former Base Headquarters. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>Base</b> Squadron was reformed as Base Support Wing. No.86 Wing took control of No.33 Squadron, operating Boeing 707 jet tanker/transports, as well as Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons, flying Hercules. No.486 Maintenance Squadron and Air Movements Training and Development Unit (AMTDU) were also under its aegis at Richmond. The Hercules, Caribous and 707s became synonymous with disaster relief and emergency transport in Australia and the region, as well as deploying on overseas peacekeeping missions. Richmond was the venue for many air shows including, in 1988, the largest staged in Australia to that date, celebrating the Australian Bicentenary. The base also staged the RAAF's 70th Anniversary Air show in 1991, the same year that the Hercules achieved 500,000 accident-free hours of operation.|$|E
25|$|Hipparchus's draconitic lunar motion {{cannot be}} solved by the lunar-four {{arguments}} that are sometimes proposed to explain his anomalistic motion. A solution that has produced the exact 5458/5923 ratio is rejected by most historians though it uses the only anciently attested method of determining such ratios, and it automatically delivers the ratio's four-digit numerator and denominator. Hipparchus initially used (Almagest 6.9) his 141 B. C. E. eclipse with a Babylonian eclipse of 720 B. C. E. to find the less accurate ratio 7160 synodic months = 7770 draconitic months, simplified by him to 716 = 777 through division by 10. (He similarly found from the 345-year cycle the ratio 4267 synodic months = 4573 anomalistic months and divided by 17 to obtain the standard ratio 251 synodic months = 269 anomalistic months.) If he sought a longer <b>time</b> <b>base</b> for this draconitic investigation he could use his same 141 B. C. E. eclipse with a moonrise 1245 B. C. E. eclipse from Babylon, an interval of 13645 synodic months = 148807 1/2 draconitic months ≈ 14623 1/2 anomalistic months. Dividing by 5/2 produces 5458 synodic months = 5923 precisely. The obvious main objection is that the early eclipse is unattested though that is not surprising in itself {{and there is no}} consensus on whether Babylonian observations were recorded this remotely. Though Hipparchus's tables formally went back only to 747 B. C. E., 600 years before his era, the tables were actually good back to before the eclipse in question because as only recently noted their use in reverse is no more difficult than forwards.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new method to learn <b>time</b> <b>based</b> rules from telecom system alarm data for {{prediction}} {{of the classes}} of alarms. A <b>time</b> <b>based</b> rule associates an alarm class with the S-tartTime attribute and other attributes of alarms. The rules are evaluated with {{the coverage of the}} rules in the training data set. Given a new alarm generated at a particular time, its alarm class can be predicted with a set of <b>time</b> <b>based</b> rules. We present a new algorithm that extracts <b>time</b> <b>based</b> rules from alarm data through an ant colony optimization (ACO) process. Given an alarm training data, a search space is formulated as a square matrix indexed by distinctive attribute values. The pheromone at the search space is computed from the training data and a <b>time</b> <b>based</b> rule is discovered from the pheromone distribution. The pheromone distribution is updated after a <b>time</b> <b>based</b> rule is extracted and the search for a new rule starts. A rule pruning process is used to remove redundant rules and increase the prediction accuracy of the final rule set. We experimented the new method on Nokia Simmons (NSN) and Ericsson data sets and compared the results of the new method and the TimeSeluth system. The comparison demonstrated that the new method outperformed TimeSeluth in prediction accuracy...|$|R

He developed a solution using a <b>time</b> <b>base</b> generator that both triggered the transmitter pulse as well as cut out the front-end of the receiver, causing it to become far less sensitive during this period.
