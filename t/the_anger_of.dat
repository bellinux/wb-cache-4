5|$|Partnership for Peace (PfP) {{membership}} {{was offered}} to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia.

It is expected that PfP membership is for these three countries the first step towards NATO membership.

He gives a very boring accounting lecture, which puts Justin to sleep. The next day, Leslie is before the Pawnee Disciplinary Committee on charges of abuse of power. Leslie calls Justin as a witness and questions him {{as to whether he}} enjoyed the party, to which he answers an emphatic yes. Afterward, the committee rules no further action will be taken, mainly because Leslie turned herself in and paid $1,000 restitution to the recreation center so no classes would be cut. When Ann asks why she did it, Leslie said it was to get an honest answer from Justin about the date, under penalty of perjury. The episode ends with Justin encouraging Tom to ask Wendy out.|$|E

5|$|Later in that year, the {{collaboration}} between monarch and premier, {{coupled with the}} fact that Tătărescu had successfully attracted nationalist votes from the Iron Guard, led to the signing of an electoral agreement between the latter, the National Peasants' Party (the main democratic opposition group), and the National Liberal Party-Brătianu — the pact was meant to prevent all attempt by Carol to manipulate the votes in elections. (A secondary and unexpected development was that the illegal PCR, which had decided to back the National Peasants' Party prior to the elections, eventually supported the electoral pact.) Tătărescu's own alliance policy rose <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>of</b> his opponents inside the PNL, as he signed collaboration agreements with the fascist Romanian Front and German Party.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Marx's childhood. The third of nine children, he became the oldest son when his brother Moritz died in 1819. Young Marx and his {{surviving}} siblings, Sophie, Hermann, Henriette, Louise, Emilie and Caroline were baptised into the Lutheran Church along with their mother in August 1824. Young Marx was privately educated by his father until 1830, when he entered Trier High School, whose headmaster, Hugo Wyttenbach, {{was a friend of}} his father. By employing many liberal humanists as teachers, Wyttenbach incurred <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>of</b> the local conservative government. Subsequently, police raided the school in 1832 and discovered that literature espousing political liberalism was being distributed among the students. Considering the distribution of such material a seditious act, the authorities instituted reforms and replaced several staff during Marx's attendance.|$|E

Ordinary creditors faced little prospect of recovering the £1 million left outstanding. Primary Contact, the marketing agency used by Sinclair to promote the C5, was left with the biggest unpaid bill, of nearly £500,000. The last of the unsold C5s were bought for £75 each by Ellar (Surplus Goods) Ltd of Liverpool, which planned to sell 1,000 of them to an Egyptian businessman for use on a university campus while another 1,500 were intended to be sold in the UK.|$|E

Corder also disappeared, but later turned up and claimed that Marten was in Ipswich, Great Yarmouth, or some other place nearby, and that he could not yet bring her back as his wife for fear of provoking <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>of</b> his friends and relatives. The pressure on Corder to produce his wife eventually forced him to leave the area. He wrote letters to Marten's family claiming that they were married and living on the Isle of Wight, and he gave various excuses for her lack of communication: she was unwell, she had hurt her hand, or the letter must have been lost.|$|E

The crews of the British squadron were decorated for their success, {{with the exception of}} Duckworth, who shared in the general thanks but was otherwise unrewarded.

5|$|Around late August {{or early}} September, Wiśniowiecki {{met with the}} army regimentarzs Władysław Dominik Zasławski-Ostrogski, Mikołaj Ostroróg and Aleksander Koniecpolski. He was not on overly {{friendly}} terms with them, as he resented being passed in military nominations, but after short negotiations he agreed to follow their orders, and thus reduced to a junior commander status which had little impact over {{the next phase of}} the campaign. On 23 September, their forces were, however, defeated at the Battle of Pyliavtsi; {{near the end of the}} battle some accounts suggest Wiśniowiecki was offered the hetman's position, but refused. On 28 September in Lviv, Wiśniowiecki, with popular support, was given a field regimentarz nomination; about a week later this nomination was confirmed by the Sejm. To <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>of</b> Lviv's townfolk, he decided to focus on retreating towards the key fortress in Zamość instead of Lviv; he would leave garrisons on both towns, and keep his army in the field. In the end, the cities were not captured by the Cossacks, who in the light of the coming winter decided to retreat, after being paid a ransom by both town councils; no other large field battle took place that year.|$|E

5|$|Caracciola {{tested the}} new Mercedes-Benz W25 at the AVUS track in April, {{and despite his}} injuries—his right leg had healed five shorter than his left, leaving him with a {{noticeable}} limp—he was cleared to race. However, Neubauer withdrew the Mercedes team from their first race, also at the AVUS track, as their practice times compared too unfavourably to Auto Union's. Caracciola was judged not fit to race for the Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring, but made the start for the German Grand Prix at the same track six weeks later. He took the lead from Auto Union driver Hans Stuck {{on the outside of}} the Karussel on the 13th lap, but retired a lap later when his engine failed. He had better luck at the 1934 Italian Grand Prix in September. In very hot weather, Caracciola started from fourth and moved to second, where he trailed Stuck. After 59laps, the pain in his leg overwhelmed him, and he pitted, letting teammate Fagioli take over his car. Fagioli won from Stuck's car which by then had been taken over by Nuvolari. His best results in the rest of the season were a second place in the Spanish Grand Prix—he led before Fagioli passed him, much to <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>of</b> Neubauer, who had ordered the Italian to hold position—and first at the Klausenpass hillclimb.|$|E
5|$|Football resumed in 1946, with Watford {{still in}} the Third Division South. A 23rd-placed finish in 1950–51 meant that the club had to apply for {{re-election}} to the league once more, but again teams in the First and Second Divisions unanimously voted for Watford {{to stay in the}} league. McBain returned in 1956, and the team remained in the division until 1958; the league was restructured into four national divisions for the 1958–59 season, and Watford were placed in the Fourth Division. Ron Burgess replaced McBain during that season, and in the following campaign Burgess presided over Watford's first Football League promotion. This team included Fourth Division top scorer Cliff Holton, who scored a club record 42 league goals in the season. Holton was sold to Northampton the following year after another 34 goals, to <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>of</b> supporters. Burgess was succeeded by Bill McGarry, who bought new players such as Charlie Livesey and Ron Saunders, and in his only season at the club led the club to what was at the time its highest ever league position: third in the Third Division. Eighteen-year-old Northern Irish goalkeeper Pat Jennings also featured under McGarry, and made his international debut despite being a Third Division player.|$|E

5|$|In August 2008, Primus {{returned}} to Charlton Athletic on a loan deal, however the deal almost collapsed as negotiations broke down between Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp and Charlton manager Alan Pardew. Pardew wanted the centre half {{for the whole}} of the 2008–09 season, but Redknapp was only happy to loan him out until Christmas of 2008 to gain match fitness, and it appeared the deal would be called off by Portsmouth. Finally Charlton agreed to the terms and Primus move to the Valley on a three-month loan days before the transfer window closed. He scored his first goal for Charlton in a 5–2 home defeat to Sheffield United. The result ultimately led to the sacking of manager Alan Pardew. He played 10 matches for the Championship (new name for Division One) club before returning to Portsmouth {{for the rest of the}} 2008–09 season. He was due to play in a crucial match against Derby County, however the match was postponed by Sky until after the expiration of his loan; much to <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>of</b> Charlton. Primus' loan had to be rearranged and a deal was agreed by both clubs for the loan to expire after the match against Derby.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Henry {{had begun}} to alter his policy of {{indirect}} rule in Brittany and started to exert more direct control. In 1164 Henry intervened to seize lands along the border of Brittany and Normandy, and in 1166 invaded Brittany to punish the local barons. Henry then forced Conan to abdicate as duke and to give Brittany to his daughter Constance; Constance was handed over and betrothed to Henry's son Geoffrey. This arrangement was quite unusual in terms of medieval law, as Conan might have had sons who could have legitimately inherited the duchy. Elsewhere in France, Henry attempted to seize the Auvergne, much to <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>of</b> the French king. Further south Henry continued to apply pressure on Raymond of Toulouse: the King campaigned there personally in 1161, sent the Archbishop of Bordeaux against Raymond in 1164 and encouraged Alfonso II of Aragon in his attacks. In 1165 Raymond divorced Louis's sister and attempted to ally himself with Henry instead.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Vizagapatam {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{fought in}} the approaches to Vizagapatam harbour in the Coastal Andhra region of British India on the Bay of Bengal on 15 September 1804 during the Napoleonic Wars. A French squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois in the ship of the line Marengo attacked the British Royal Navy fourth rate ship HMS Centurion and two East Indiaman merchant ships anchored in the harbour roads. Linois was engaged in an extended raiding campaign, which had already involved operations in the South China Sea, in the Mozambique Channel, off Ceylon and along the Indian coast of the Bay of Bengal. The French squadron had fought one notable engagement, at the Battle of Pulo Aura on 15 February 1804, in which Linois had attacked the Honourable East India Company's (HEIC) China Fleet, a large convoy of well-armed merchant ships carrying cargo worth £8 million.

Carl says the area is largely {{unprotected}} due to budget cuts, so Leslie vows to get more funding. She appears on Pawnee Today, the local news show, saying the Pawnee government failed the parks and that security is poor. Paul (Phil Reeves), the city manager, is angry over the television appearance, but informs Leslie the stunt worked and the mayor is offering $2,500 to help fix the park. While at a press conference about the money, Jerry confesses to Leslie that he wasn't mugged: he dropped a breakfast burrito in a creek, then fell while trying to grab it and dislocated his shoulder. He fabricated the mugger story because he was embarrassed and didn't want everyone to make fun of him. Leslie angrily relates Jerry's story to Mark, but he stops her short when he says that Jerry was too scared of his co-workers to be honest with them. Leslie soon discovers Carl was offended by Leslie's statements about park security and plans to show footage of Jerry falling into the creek on Pawnee Today. Leslie negotiates with Carl to not show the event, and instead they talk during the show about how much they enjoyed the film Avatar, much to <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>of</b> host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins). As part of their deal to not show the tape, Leslie buys Carl a brand new security cart. Carl hands over the tape, which she agrees to throw away after she watches it one last time.

Patronage and bribery failed to assuage <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>of</b> FLEC-R and FLEC-FAC and negotiations ended.

FLEC-FLAC kidnapped eleven people in April 1998, nine Angolans and two Portuguese, released for a $500,000 ransom. FLEC-R kidnapped five Byansol-oil engineering employees, two Frenchman, two Portuguese, and an Angolan, in March 1999. While militants released the Angolan, the government complicated the situation by promising the rebel leadership $12.5million for the hostages.
