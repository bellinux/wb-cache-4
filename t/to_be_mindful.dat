25|$|The grape is a late budding and {{ripening}} {{variety that}} {{is prone to}} produce high yields if not kept in check by winter pruning or green harvesting. In addition to its susceptibility to numerous grapevine viruses, Agiorgitiko is also very sensitive to fungal infection from botrytis bunch rot, downy and powdery mildew. The vine also responds adversely to water stress which may require some irrigation in regions where the practice is permitted. In order to limit yields, Agiorgitiko is often densely planted in poor vineyard soils but growers need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>mindful</b> of the variety's sensitivity to potassium deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Leo and Chen {{also suggest}} that the two tests are similar in most respects, with only a narrow gap between them, and would produce the same result in most cases. They caution that judges, rather than {{concerning}} themselves with the labels given to the tests for bias, should be wary of taking extraneous matters into consideration, no matter which test is applied. The case of Locabail (UK) Ltd. v. Bayfield Properties Ltd. (1999) identified two particular issues for judges <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>mindful</b> of– special knowledge and legal sophistication. The authors concluded their analysis by suggesting that the true importance of the matter lies not in which test is used, but in ensuring that judges have taken into account all relevant circumstances and excluded extraneous considerations which {{would not have been}} applicable to the general public.|$|E

Despite having to voice Goku, Gohan, Goten and Burdock, Nozawa claims she is able to instantly get into the respective character simply upon seeing their image. Nozawa explained that she did not read the manga so that she would not know what was coming in the story until recording, making her reactions the same as Goku's.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Agyarko's ministerial {{confirmation}} in February 2017, he {{was accused}} by Mahama Ayariga of the parliamentary appointment committee of bribing members of the minority to facilitate his approval as a Minister of energy. Ayariga reported on Radio Gold, that Agyarko through Muntaka Mubarak, the minority chief whip, had tried to influence {{the decision of the}} Appointments Committee of Parliament by giving each minority member a bribe. The Speaker of Parliament, Aaron Mike Oquaye set up an adhoc parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. After the investigation, the Joe Ghartey committee exonerated Agyarko but cited and found Ayariga guilty of being in contempt of parliament for making false allegations against a colleague and bringing the parliament into disrepute. Ayariga was made to render an apology on the floor of parliament and warned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>mindful</b> of his actions in the future. After his ministerial appointment was approved, Ayariga publicly praised Agyarko for his track record asserting that his nomination was approved on merit.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{equipment}} {{rotation and}} maintenance concerns, Caltrain said in 2009 {{that it could}} not dedicate cars with higher bike capacity on trains with high bike demand. Many of you have written to ask a series of questions about this new effort: Why can’t we provide two bike cars on every train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on my train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on the most heavily used trains? Why is there only one bike car on trains that are supposed to have two bike cars? The simplest answer to most of these questions is that we don’t have enough bike cars to put two on every train, or even on every peak train, and, in doing all we can to expand service for our cycling customers, we have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>mindful</b> of the impact of these changes on our entire system and all of our customers, particularly on on-time performance. All of our cars, not just our bike cars, serve our entire schedule throughout our entire day, which means they rotate through the schedule, and also must be rotated out of service for fueling, washing, maintenance and federally mandated safety and operational inspections. A train set that starts its day in San Jose may finish its day in Millbrae and be cycled to San Francisco for its daily maintenance and to begin the next day at the San Francisco station. Because of this rotation – because of the demands of our entire service schedule – we can’t guarantee that a specific stop on the schedule will have a specific train.}} Eventually, two bike cars were added to every train consist by 2011, and in 2016, a third bike car was added to Bombardier consists.|$|E

As such, the dinosaurs could not dominate the episode, and Chibnall had to tell [...] "a big other story". The scene where Amy, Riddell, and Nefertiti stumble upon a sleeping Tyrannosaurus rex was almost cut as it was originally intended to feature computer-generated (CGI) raptors, which were too expensive. However, Millennium FX realised they could use a baby T-Rex {{that had been in}} an exhibit they designed. The episode contains a variety of [...] "favourite" [...] dinosaurs; some were built from scratch, while others were CGI. Smith had to wear padded trousers when riding the triceratops, and recalled it was [...] "a painful couple of hours, a laugh though and definitely worth it". Half of the triceratops was actually built and pushed by crewmen when Smith, Darvill, and Williams were riding it. The rest of it was filled in with CGI by The Mill. The Doctor Who logo in the title sequence featured the texture of a dinosaur's hide, in keeping with the varied [...] "blockbuster" [...] themes for each of the opening five episodes of the series. A preview clip of the episode was released at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International.|$|E

However, Pam is unable to keep herself from crying out in horror when she sees her mother cast in the film as a scantily clad nurse, and Jim (John Krasinski) fails to fully suppress his laughter at [...] "The Scarn" [...] scene, so Michael angrily stops the movie and takes it away. Michael asks Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) what she thought and she does not seem impressed. Michael gets angry at her because he considers the film his [...] "dream", and he then offers {{the rest of the}} office the opportunity to finish seeing the film, which they happily accept. While watching, Michael begins noting how the film is not really very good; he steps outside and tells Holly that it is a bad film but also one that people are having fun watching.

In 2010, while lecturing on nuclear weapons politics, Majid endorsed Qadeer Khan's services and stressed to the fact that: [...] "Pakistan had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>mindful</b> of a blatant pursuit of military preponderance in its eastern neighborhood". Lecturing at the National Defence University, General Majid argued that [...] "a proposed fissile material cutoff treaty would target Pakistan specifically.

As chairman joint chiefs, Majid had asserted his role as principle military adviser to the [...] government of Prime minister Yousaf Raza Gillani and President Asif Ali Zardari on the matters involving the nuclear policy, military affairs, and geostrategic positions of Pakistan. [...] He presented the government a tri-services combat framework to tackle the joint combat operations against the extreme elements; a plan which was duly approved by Prime minister Gillani {{as part of his}} war strategy. While presenting this plan Majid noted to Prime minister Gillani {{that there is a need}} to harmonize individual capacities of the services so that efforts are synergized within a framework of jointness and inter-operability to meet present and future challenges.
