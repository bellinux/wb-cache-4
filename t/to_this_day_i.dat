Ferguson changed into the club tracksuit in order {{to carry out his}} television duties. Speculation that the player who threw the pizza was Cesc Fàbregas arose when Cole hinted that the culprit was neither English nor French. In his autobiography, Ferguson said: [...] "They say it was Cesc Fàbregas who threw the pizza at me but, <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> have no idea who the culprit is."

And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|E

Vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn of Machine Head said that when creating the band's 2007 album, The Blackening, [...] "What we mean is an album that has the power, influence and epic grandeur of that album Master of Puppetsand the staying powera timeless record like that".

Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold said touring with Metallica was the band's career highlight, and said, [...] "Selling tons of records and playing huge shows will never compare to meeting your idols Metallica". God Forbid guitarists Doc and Dallas Coyle were inspired by Metallica as they grew up, and the band's bassist John Outcalt admires Burton as a [...] "rocker". Ill Niño drummer Dave Chavarri said he finds early Metallica releases are [...] "heavy, raw, rebellious.

Stewart and Creme were about to go on holiday, however, and had left their manager Harvey Lisberg with power of attorney to accept the Branson offer. No sooner had they left the country, but another higher bid arrived from Phonogram and was accepted by the management team, including Lisberg.

"I {{wanted to}} learn about Christ– about the Old Testament, which had been his Bible, and the New Testament, which was the Bible about him; {{about the history of}} the church, which had been founded on the faith that through him God had not only {{revealed}} his innermost nature and his purpose for the world, but had released into the world a fierce power to draw people into that nature and adapt them to that purpose... No intellectual pursuit had ever aroused in me such intense curiosity, and much more than my intellect was involved, much more than my curiosity aroused. In the unfamiliar setting of a Presbyterian church, of all places, I had been moved to astonished tears which came from so deep inside me that <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> have never fathomed them, I {{wanted to learn}} more about the source of those tears and the object of that astonishment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, New York's Brooklyn Public Library also {{banned the}} book due to [...] "bad word choice" [...] and Huck's having [...] "not only itched but scratched" [...] within the novel, which was {{considered}} obscene.

He followed this by stating, [...] "Pleasure was something that was treated with great suspicion, pleasure was something that... I was going to say it had to be earned but even the earning of it didn't really work. It was something <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> mean, I carry that with me.

2500|$|Although it was Green's {{cancer that}} caused The Tom Green Show to cease production, a {{frequent}} rumor {{says that the}} show was cancelled because of an alleged segment where Green shows up at a bar mitzvah, or another Jewish event, dressed as Adolf Hitler. Green, however, has repeatedly denied that such a segment exists, {{and there is no}} evidence to suggest that such an event occurred. He mentions the rumor in his 2004 autobiography, Hollywood Causes Cancer, stating that it apparently started when some Boston teenagers were caught videotaping themselves performing a similar stunt and when asked by security, they used the name [...] "Tom Green." [...] Green says, [...] "I would never do a mean-spirited, anti-Semitic joke like that – it's both abhorrent and not funny. <b>To</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> still get asked about it, and it's annoying. So again, for the record, it didn't happen. There is nobody on this planet that has ever seen this bit on tape because it does not exist. If it did exist, it would have certainly reared its ugly, hateful head on the Internet by now. But it won't, because it doesn't exist. I've never put on a Hitler costume.

2500|$|In 1965, {{together}} with Tam Harvey, Connolly started {{a group called}} the Humblebums. At their first gig, Connolly reportedly introduced them both to the audience by saying, [...] "My name's Billy Connolly, and I'm humble. This is Tam Harvey, he's a bum." [...] The band would later include Gerry Rafferty, who saw Connolly at a charity show in Paisley. [...] "Gerry was very good for me. He taught me that I would never be a musician as long as my arse looked south. He was just so outstandingly good and getting better, and although I was getting better too, the space between us remained huge. He was a real musician, he knew and felt music, a bass player, with a lovely sense of harmony, as well as a great guitarist. I knew tunes and how to play them but that was where my musicianship ended. Unfortunately, I’m still the same <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>day.</b> <b>I</b> work very hard, I play every day but I’m still ordinary. I can be flashy, but it’s all tricks really. He’s a musician and I’m just not in the same league. So, I gave up these ambitions and concentrated on what I was really born to do." [...] After Harvey left the group, Connolly and Rafferty continued as a duo and the latter two of their three albums featured just that duo. [...] Connolly sang, played five-string banjo, guitar, and autoharp, and at live shows entertained the audience with his humorous introductions to the songs.|$|E
