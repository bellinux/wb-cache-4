50|$|The skilled part {{of being}} <b>a</b> lamp <b>trimmer</b> was the ability <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>a</b> wick {{in such a way}} that it would burn evenly, without hot spots, so that it would not need {{attention}} again for some time. <b>A</b> poorly <b>trimmed</b> wick creates <b>a</b> flame which is dim and smokey. <b>A</b> properly <b>trimmed</b> wick should come to a rounded point, or should be wedge shaped. When lit, the wick should burn cleanly all the way up to the highest flame it can make. The flame should be at least the width of the wick, and even, not ragged.|$|R

50|$|When a {{servo tab}} is employed, it is {{moved into the}} {{slipstream}} opposite to the control surface's desired deflection. For example, in order <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>an</b> elevator <b>to</b> hold the nose down, the elevator's trim tab will actually rise up into the slipstream. The increased pressure {{on top of the}} trim tab surface caused by raising it will then deflect the entire elevator slab down slightly, causing the tail to rise and the aircraft's nose to move down. In the case of an aircraft where deployment of high-lift devices (flaps) would significantly alter the longitudinal <b>trim,</b> <b>a</b> supplementary <b>trim</b> tab is arranged to simultaneously deploy with the flaps so that pitch attitude is not markedly changed.|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} {{environment has}} been developed enabling the computation of the elastic and trimmed aircraft. It consists of <b>a</b> <b>trim</b> algorithm which is coupled with a procedure {{to account for the}} interaction between fluid and structure. The trim algorithm is based on a Newton method with a discretized Jacobian. It incorporates the six degrees-of-freedom (DoF) flight-mechanics equations and thereby enables <b>to</b> compute different <b>trimmed</b> states. The fluid-structure interaction (FSI) procedure uses a partitioned approach to compute the flow around the configuration in static aeroelastic equilibrium. This simulation environment has been successfully applied <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>a</b> rigid transport-aircraft configuration in viscous flow as well as in inviscid flow with rigid and flexible wing...|$|R

50|$|The {{high angle}} of attack {{investigations}} on the Gulfstream II indicated that stable trim conditions existed up to 45 degrees {{angle of attack}}. The elevator deflection required <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>to</b> the primary stall at most forward center of gravity was sufficient <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>a</b> deep stall at the aft center of gravity, but recovery from deep stall was immediate upon forward stick motion, and more than adequate nose-down elevator control was available. The acceptability of the Gulfstream II high angle of attack characteristics {{and the absence of}} a deep stall influence on configuration sizing and arrangement was attributed to the mitigating influence of the nacelle-wing overlap on nacelle contribution. Configuration buildup studies revealed the adverse nacelle influence on tail pitching moment contribution above 30 degrees angle of attack was not unduly severe and no appreciable effect on elevator or stabilizer effectiveness was found.|$|R
50|$|Infected crops {{transmit}} {{the virus in}} a number of ways, but in most cases transmittal requires physical contact. This mean that touching an infected plant, then touching a healthy plant could cause the healthy plant to contract the virus. Using tools <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>an</b> infected plant, then using them on a healthy plant without sterilizing them between uses can result in the transmission of the virus. The virus should be treated like it is airborne since an insect can {{transmit the}} virus, from plant to plant, just by flying around and making contact between plants. Hemp mosaic virus is particularly resilient and can infect the soil through the winter and into the following growing seasons for years.|$|R
