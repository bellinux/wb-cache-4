5|$|Miles {{turns up}} in Summer Bay and decides <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>around</b> after {{he thinks it}} is a {{familiar}} setting. He has nowhere to live and is starving. Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) becomes annoyed with him for stealing food out of the bins, but Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) takes pity on him and feeds him. He sees Sally {{on the beach and}} writes Milco in the sand. They later become friends and she feels like she has a close connection. He reveals his family's death to be the reason why he became a drifter. He eventually reveals the truth to Sally, that he is Milco and her twin brother. After it sinks in she is delighted with this and they become close. Miles stays with her and one night forgets to lock the door. Johnny Cooper (Callan Mulvey) enters the house and stabs Sally, however she survives but he blames himself. He decides to get his life back on track and becomes an English teacher at the school. Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance) initially gives him a hard time, but he is well liked after he and Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) arrange a leaving party for Sally, who has decided to move away. At the party Steven Matheson (Adam Willits) and Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson) are startled to meet the person they heard so much about whilst growing up.|$|E
25|$|England's reply {{got off to}} a {{disastrous}} start, with Lathwell caught behind off Hughes in the first over, and Smith and Stewart following soon after, leaving the hosts reeling on 50/3. Atherton (55) and Gooch (59) worked hard to restore some pride to the scoreboard with a century partnership, before Atherton's dismissal by Reiffel saw the collapse begin. From 158/3, none of the middle and lower order managed <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>around,</b> and Hughes (3-47) and Reiffel (5-65) cleaned up.|$|E
25|$|Ybor {{also had}} good {{business}} {{reasons to be}} magnanimous. His goal was to not only attract residents to town, but {{to get them to}} stay. His employees in Key West had often traveled back and forth between Florida and Cuba looking for the best pay and conditions. By offering the anchor of land and home ownership – something most tabaqueros had never experienced, especially in land-scarce Key West – Ybor encouraged his workers <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>around.</b> Though the workforce was still relatively fluid in the early years, enough workers remained in Tampa to keep the cigar factories fully staffed and running year-round.|$|E
40|$|A {{crisis that}} is {{currently}} stiffing the Euro Zone does equally suspend and shadows {{the debate on the}} European integration, that actually remains a different issue and, why not, still useful. This integration needs some more corrections: the old model revising, updating or readapting to a new reality and answers <b>to</b> questions <b>sticking</b> <b>around</b> this crisis. Reassessing specific concepts just starts here...|$|R

He has been known <b>to</b> pogo <b>stick</b> uncontrollably <b>around</b> Sesame Street, often causing havoc with all that gets in his way. This segment is shown on Sesame Street Unpaved. Baby Bear is his best friend and appears occasionally in many of the main plots in the later series. Telly also has something of a friendship with Oscar the Grouch, since they appear in many segments together.|$|R
500|$|... "What Is... Cliff Clavin?" [...] is {{an eighth}} season {{episode of the}} American {{television}} series Cheers. It was directed by Andy Ackerman rather than James Burrowswho directed 243 out of 273 episodes of the showand originally aired January 18, 1990 on NBC. [...] In this episode, Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) appears on the game show Jeopardy! and game show host Alex Trebek guest stars as himself. Cliff racks up [...] during the game but loses {{it all in the}} final round, and he unsuccessfully demands that his answer be accepted. Back at Cheers, Trebek encounters Cliff and announces his resignation from the game show, prompting Cliff to reconsider. Unbeknownst to Cliff, Trebek did that mainly to avoid him. Meanwhile, Sam retrieves his address book from a teenage boy Timmy, who repeatedly calls Sam's past dates, and ironically encourages Timmy <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> girls <b>around</b> his age. The episode received praise from critics for its concept and its guest star.|$|R
500|$|The New York Times reported: [...] "Cary Grant was not {{supposed}} to die. Cary Grant was supposed <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>around.</b> Our perpetual touchstone of charm and elegance and youth". Grant's body was taken back to California, where it was cremated and his ashes scattered in the Pacific Ocean. He refused a funeral, which Roderick Mann remarked was appropriate for [...] "the private man who didn't want the nonsense of a funeral". The bulk of his estate, worth in the region of 60 to 80 million dollars, went to his wife Barbara Harris and his daughter Jennifer Grant.|$|E
500|$|According to AllMusic editor Alexey Eremenko, [...] "Rock'n'Roll Circus {{is pretty}} versatile: {{there are a}} couple of pop/rock tracks, a Middle Eastern techno tune, a playful plastic pop song, even a jungle interlude, and, of course, a slew of epic, string-drenched ballads that no J-pop singer seems to be able to resist performing". Greg from Selective Hearing stated that the album's {{material}} showed more [...] "restraint" [...] than her previous music; [...] "There is a deliberate pacing that entices the listener <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>around.</b> You don't get hammered over the head". Asian Junkie editor Random J reviewed the album on his personal blog, and noticed the music and themes for Rock 'n' Roll Circus were more consistent than her previous albums. Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express noted the album's [...] "formulaic rock music".|$|E
500|$|Hurd {{ultimately}} {{departed from}} the series during the [...] to join the Showtime drama series Leap Years. After her departure from the show, Hurd said, [...] "I think it's just sad they didn't have faith <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>around</b> with me." [...] However, she said she bore no ill feelings about her time on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, but felt the casting on Leap Years was a [...] "rare opportunity". Roger Friedman, an entertainment journalist for Fox News, reported that Richard Belzer arranged for Hurd to be fired because her character was receiving too many story-lines and distracting attention from him, but that report was never confirmed. Although Jeffries {{departed from the}} Special Victims Unit during the episode [...] "Asunder", her character was still present in the episode [...] "Runaway", which marked the character's final appearance. [...] "Runaway" [...] was originally intended to air before [...] "Asunder" [...] but was broadcast out of order.|$|E
5000|$|At this point, Björk {{had decided}} to leave the band to pursue her solo career, but their {{contract}} included the making of one last album with a subsequent promotional tour, which Björk agreed <b>to</b> do. <b>Stick</b> <b>Around</b> for Joy was released in February 1992. The record received positive reviews. The Sugarcubes opened for U2 during the US leg of their Zoo TV Tour in October and November 1992, playing to a grand total of 700,000 people. Coinciding with this string of concerts, their label released a remix album named It's-It. Björk was featured on two tracks of the soundtrack for the 1992 film Remote Control (known as Sódóma Reykjavík in Iceland). After the Sugarcubes played one last gig at the Reykjavík club Tunglið around Christmas, they split up. They are nowadays recognized as [...] "Iceland's biggest rock band". The Sugarcubes are all still involved in the management of Smekkleysa/Bad Taste.|$|R

Organizing the various gambling houses (and other forms of vice implied but, for Code reasons, not explicitly stated) into a consolidated enterprise in alliance with a corrupt city boss, Jim Dailey, he comes into conflict with a crusading newspaper, run by Jean Barrat, the daughter of the late murdered publisher, and Charles Ford, the idealistic editor.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{quantify}} and characterize the transition in farm structure in Cache Valley over the last 50 years. We initially expected to see a dramatic {{reduction in the number}} of family farms in Cache Valley, and we expected that most growth in the agricultural industry had stemmed from large industrial farms. This project attempts to “tell the story” of farm structural change in Cache Valley. It begins with a rigorous quantitative exploration of farming in Cache valley, examining farm sizes, the amount of farmed land, and the number of farms. We differentiate between family and industrial farming on the basis of the principal source of labor. Then, original perspectives on the state of agriculture in Cache Valley were collected from a number of prominent local agriculturists. We examine the different drivers of change in the agricultural makeup of the valley, including those that are regulatory, technological, or market-based in nature. We also highlight some of the environmental concerns related to changing farm structures. We conclude by predicting what the future holds for farming in Cache Valley, including how and why small family farms seem <b>to</b> always <b>stick</b> <b>around...</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{character}} {{is one of}} the longest-serving in British soap, coming third behind Ken Barlow and [...] Emily Bishop in a 1998 survey assessing character episode appearances in Coronation Street's history. In 1999, when Betty was celebrating 30 years on-screen, Alison Boshoff of the Daily Mail praised the character's never changing style: [...] "for 30 years, one favourite fixture of Coronation Street has remained exactly the same [...] barmaid Betty Turpin. With her neatly-set hair, comfortable, bustling manner, and brilliant smile, she has been dispensing homespun advice – and, of course, those celebrated hotpots – at the Rovers Return for more than a generation." [...] Commenting on her 30th anniversary with the show, Betty Driver said, [...] "It is just amazing that I've been here for 30 years. I suppose I have never really counted up the time I've been with the show, because I still enjoy it so much and am always looking forward rather than back. Really, it has been a wonderful experience and I feel very glad I was able <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>around</b> for so long." ...|$|E
500|$|... "West Coast" [...] {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from contemporary music critics. Michael Nelson of Stereogum commented, [...] "This {{is just a}} haunting, hypnotic piece of music that sends chills {{up and down my}} entire skeleton, especially when the tempo shifts downward on the chorus". Nylon writer Liza Darwin deemed the track [...] "silky-smooth" [...] and [...] "total ear candy". Lauren Valenti of Marie Claire lauded the song as [...] "a slice of retro heaven". The track was noted by Stern to be [...] "revolutionary" [...] {{in the sense that it}} sounded [...] "entirely different from anything being offered in pop music at the moment" [...] and deemed it [...] "the very antithesis of everything radio in 2014". Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club named [...] "West Coast" [...] as the album's most accomplished track and [...] "the one song on Ultraviolence that gets the formula of Lana Del Rey right". AltSounds deemed the track as one of Del Rey's best works and one of the best singles released in 2014. The publication went on to opine, [...] "when songs defy descriptions, and artists defy expectation, they tend <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>around</b> long after the 'pop hits' and divas have suck back into obscurity". Oyster journalist Jerico Mandybur commented, [...] "there's no denying that the song has excellent aural pulling power, especially if you like your odes to LA mysterious, darkly surfy and dripping in femme fatale".|$|E
500|$|Mylod {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} filming the final {{scenes of the}} episode, the foot chase between Arya and the Waif, in the behind the scenes featurette published by HBO after the airing of the episode. Mylod stated that he did extensive research {{in order to create}} the foot chase, saying [...] "I devoured every foot chase in the history of cinema, but trying to take from that something that would fit into the blueprint of the Game of Thrones visual style, which is not necessarily the same kind of kinetic, handheld feel that you find in many contemporary thrillers. It's a much more classic frame." [...] He continued, [...] "Everything hinged from finding this very lovely, steep stairwell and thinking 'Wouldn't it be great if she leapt off that, and then tumbled down the stairs?' I had this image in my head that I wanted lots of oranges rolling down, not quite sure where that comes from, but it looked pretty." [...] Mylod also stated in a separate interview that it was a conscious decision not to show the final fight between Arya and the Waif, given that it took place in the dark, noting [...] "when the character dies in the dark, unless we switch on night-vision goggles, we're {{not going to be able}} to see that, and we're not going <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>around</b> to hear a scream in the dark anyway. It was actually a conscious choice in the writing and I think, for me, a very elegant storytelling beat as to get that reveal a few seconds later." ...|$|E
5000|$|Maximum {{applauded the}} high video {{quality of the}} {{cinematic}} sequences but overall panned the game for its controls, stating that [...] "Whether using mouse or joystick ... your vehicle jolts and twitches with {{a life of its}} own, and there is {{nothing you can do about}} it except to employ tiny steadying movements in the hope that the craft doesn't take offense to your attempt at control and vehemently bounce around the screen." [...] They also criticized the game's linearity, low difficulty, poor acting, and anticlimactic final level. A Next Generation critic similarly found that while the video quality is excellent, the acting is poor and the plot is a thinly veiled rehash of the original Star Wars film. He also argued that the gameplay is too limited, likening it to [...] "a movie that requires you <b>to</b> move a <b>stick</b> <b>around</b> and press a button at certain points until you get to see more of the movie." ...|$|R
2500|$|Liddell was {{defeated}} by Rua due to punches {{late in the first}} round resulting in a technical knockout. After the fight, White declared that Liddell would retire from fighting. White stated, [...] "I care about him. I care about his health, and it's over, man. It's over." [...] White went further, saying, [...] "At the end of the day, I care about these guys. I don't want <b>to</b> see anybody <b>stick</b> <b>around</b> too long. You're never going to see Chuck Liddell on the canvas again." [...] In May however, Liddell's trainer, John Hackleman, claimed 'with confidence' that Liddell isn't done yet and that he's [...] "definitely on top of the food chain." [...] Liddell has [...] "more than one fight left in him." [...] In an interview afterward, White went on to rhetorically ask [...] "can I tell him not to fight? Absolutely not. If he still wants to fight, he can fight. I'm not saying, 'It will never happen. It will never happen.' But he made a deal with me [...]" ...|$|R

2500|$|The premiere drew mainly {{positive}} {{reviews from}} critics, with most to all complementing the new characters. Christine Petralia of Buddy TV said the premiere [...] "picks up right where last season left off and doesn't skip a beat. Frozen fans will be pumped {{that it looks}} like Elsa and Anna are going <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>around</b> for a while as they search for answers about their parents' death. Meanwhile, a heartbroken Regina seeks out an old friend to help her [...] "change the book" [...] so she can finally get her happy ending. And as usual, Rumple can't seem to shake his obsession with power." ...|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, {{the turmoil}} that Sue {{had been through}} had led Ratcliff to {{consider}} quitting the serial prematurely. In 1987 she told the magazine Woman's Own, [...] "'s been such an unhappy woman since Hassan died. And {{it was beginning to}} rub off on me. I'd go to work, six days a week, be stuck in that grim little cafe and be permanently miserable. I got to the stage when I started to ask myself if I really wanted to spend all my working life playing a misery." [...] However, according to Ratcliff, the scriptwriters decision to make Sue pregnant changed her mind about leaving. She said, [...] "Now Sue is pregnant and happy I feel differently about the role. So maybe it would be fun <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>around</b> for a couple more years - if I'm wanted." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a {{positive}} review and welcomed Barr back to television. [...] He said, [...] "She's foulmouthed, abrasive and suffers absolutely nothing gladly. Yet, as always, her own foibles crack her {{up as much}} as they do her boyfriend or visiting eldest son. The fact that she's completely unafraid to hold herself up to ridicule endears her to her audience". [...] He also noted that a reality show format [...] "probably fits Barr better than, say, another sitcom [...] ". He ended his review saying, [...] "The wild pigs might not want <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>around,</b> but the rest of us should be willing to give Roseanne's Nuts a shot for a few episodes, at least. [...] Scott D. Pierce of The Salt Lake Tribune said in his review, [...] "As reality shows go, Roseanne's Nuts is pretty mild. Oh, she's bleeped a lot. And there's some blurring of nudity. (Ick.) But mostly it's just Roseanne being Roseanne on a macadamia nut farm".|$|E

During the first half hour, the episode placed second in its timeslot, but dropped to fourth for its second half. Its lead-in, Kitchen Nightmares, also dropped 12 percent, as did all other network shows for that night. Time shifting viewing added 57 percent to the episode's ratings for three days out, and 64 percent for a week following the first airing.

Despite this, Joshua Jackson urged fans to watch the series live {{in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly a week after [...] "Immortality" [...] aired.
