Wired UKs Quitin Smith said {{it could}} be the most terrifying game of 2012, and Rock Paper Shotgun's Jim Rossignol called it the best game he had played so far in 2012. PC Gamer stated the game {{was one of the most}} important things to happen to PC gaming in 2012 and included it in their 2012 list of the top five scariest PC games of all time. Metro called it one of the best games to ever to come out of PC modding and one of the single most impressive experiences available on the system.

Labeled a “Social Democrat” instead of being primarily nationalist, La Luz decided instead to become active in Democratic Party politics. He also began a career as an organizer for several unions, which sought to organize the growing Hispanic workforce in the low wage manufacturing and service sectors. For him, it had become clear that <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do was {{to improve the lives}} of people who needed basic rights.|$|E
25|$|The series fleshes out Scrooge's {{upbringing}} by depicting {{his life}} as an individual who worked hard his entire life to earn his keep and to fiercely defend it against those who were truly dishonest, But also, he defend {{his family and friends}} from any dangers,including villains.

The nephews find out that the only way to break the spell is make the person realize that the object of their love will cost them something they truly love. The boys make it appear that Scrooge's love is allergic to money; however, he simply decides to give up his wealth so he can be with her.

25|$|Ælfric {{was asked}} by Æthelweard to {{translate}} the book of Genesis up {{to the story of}} Abraham and Isaac, along with selections from other books of the Hexateuch. Against his better judgment, Ælfric agreed because he knew it would be done regardless of whether he helped or not. This, the Old English Hexateuch, was revolutionary, for {{it was the first time}} that the Bible was translated from Latin into the vernacular, that is, into Old English. To his translation of Genesis, he wrote a preface. This preface was to ensure that the uneducated who might read this translation of the Old Testament would understand that they ought not believe that the practices of the ancient Israelites were still acceptable for Christians. In his preface, Ælfric employs the same writing techniques that King Alfred used in his preface to a translation of the Cura Pastoralis. Also notable is that in his translation of Genesis Ælfric did not just translate it word for word from the Latin, which was common due to the belief that the word order of sacred Scripture was itself sacred. Rather, he translated much of it by its meaning; he recognized that the meaning of what the Bible said was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be conveyed, not the word order.|$|E
500|$|Research in 2009 {{indicated}} that Australians reflect on history and future fairly equally on Australia Day. Of those polled, 43% agreed {{that history is}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> think about on Australia Day and 41% said they look towards [...] "our future", while 13% {{thought it was important}} to [...] "think about the present at this time" [...] and 3% were unsure. Despite the date reflecting the arrival of the First Fleet, contemporary celebrations are not particularly historical in their theme. There are no large-scale re-enactments and the national leader's participation is focused largely on events such as the Australian of the Year Awards announcement and Citizenship Ceremonies.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder, and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening {{thought it was a}} [...] "quintessential" [...] Swartzwelder episode, and executive producer/show runner David Mirkin said it was a [...] "fantastic job by one of the most prolific writers of the show". <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> Mirkin while making the episode was {{to make sure that the}} elephant would be a [...] "bastard" [...] and behave rudely, unlike other animals on the show. For example, instead of putting people on his back, Stampy would put them in his mouth. Mirkin said the elephant [...] "never quite bonds because it's a very cantankerous animal, a concept that was very important to this episode". Stampy has since been used several times in jokes later on in the series. For example, Stampy made an appearance in the season nine episode [...] "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace" [...] in one of Bart's dreams, and in the season fourteen episode [...] "Large Marge", where he is used by Bart in a stunt to help Krusty the Clown win back his popularity. Stampy appeared briefly in The Simpsons Movie, where he tries to break down the giant glass dome lowered over Springfield. The episode also introduces the character Cletus Spuckler. He is shown as one of the [...] "slack-jawed yokels" [...] gawking at Stampy in the Simpson family's backyard. Cletus is not named in the episode, so the staff simply referred to him as the Slack-Jawed Yokel.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{nominated}} for Best Metal Performance at the 49th annual Grammy Awards. When asked for his thoughts on the nomination, King revealed {{that he did not}} [...] "even care", and noted that Slayer fans [...] "don't give a shit and that's <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> me". The interviewer expressed his surprise at the nomination given Slayer's [...] "inflammatory" [...] lyrics, to which King replied, [...] "That would be the coolest thing, you know? To win with the shit we write about." [...] The ceremony was held on February 11, 2007, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, with Slayer competing against Mastodon, Lamb of God, Ministry and Stone Sour. Slayer won the Best Metal Performance Grammy award, although the band was unable to attend because of a conflicting North American headlining tour. Araya commented about the win from a hotel room in Columbus, Ohio: [...] "Jeff [...] and I put a lot into 'Eyes of the Insane' so we're thrilled that the Grammy voters took the time to listen to it, and then vote for it. We're out here on the road and we're all really, really happy." [...] King disagreed, deeming the song [...] "one of the poorest representations of us [...] on the record [...] ". He further said that, if given the decision, he would have chosen the controversial track [...] "Jihad" [...] to represent Slayer from their ninth album Christ Illusion. Critical of the Recording Academy, King said, [...] "Realistically, I think people on the academy who vote pick the household name ... And that's what we are." ...|$|E

2500|$|Midwifery-led {{continuity}} of care is where one or more midwives have the primary responsibility for the {{continuity of}} care for childbearing women, with a multidisciplinary network of consultation and referral with other health care providers. This is different from [...] "medical-led care" [...] where an obstetrician or family physician is primarily responsible. In [...] "shared-care" [...] models, responsibility may be shared between a midwife, an obstetrician and/or a family physician. The midwife plays a very unique role is part of very intimate situations with the mother. For this reason, many say that <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{look for in a}} midwife is comfortability with them, as one will go to them with every question or problem.|$|E
2500|$|Neither {{the quality}} of Bow's voice nor her Brooklyn accent was an issue to Bow, her fans, or Paramount. However, Bow, like Charlie Chaplin, Louise Brooks, and most other silent film stars, did not embrace the novelty: [...] "I hate talkies ... they're stiff and limiting. You {{lose a lot of}} your cuteness, because there's no chance for action, and action is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> me." [...] A visibly nervous Bow had to do a number of retakes in The Wild Party because her eyes kept {{wandering}} up to the microphone overhead. [...] "I can't buck progress [...]. I have to do the best I can," [...] she said. In October 1929, Bow described her nerves as [...] "all shot", saying that she had reached [...] "the breaking point", and Photoplay cited reports of [...] "rows of bottles of sedatives" [...] by her bed.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kerouac, On the Road [...] "was {{really a}} story about two Catholic buddies roaming the country in search of God. And we found him. I found him in the sky, in Market Street San Francisco (those 2 visions), and Dean (Neal) had God {{sweating}} out of his forehead all the way. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OUT FOR THE HOLY MAN: HE MUST SWEAT FOR GOD. And once he has found Him, the Godhood of God is forever Established and really must not be spoken about." [...] According to his [...] biographer, historian Douglas Brinkley, On the Road has been misinterpreted as a tale of companions out looking for kicks, but <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> comprehend is that Kerouac was an American Catholic author – for example, virtually every page of his diary bore a sketch of a crucifix, a prayer, or an appeal to Christ to be forgiven.|$|E

Sandé always said that her education was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> her, stating if her music career was to fail, she would have her education to fall back on. Sandé said that her manager, Adrian Sykes, waited patiently since she was 16, saying [...] "Adrian really respects that I want to get an education behind me. He also knows my parents are keen that I finish university." [...] Sandé first performed publicly when she provided guest vocals on Chipmunk's hit single, [...] "Diamond Rings" [...] which she also wrote in 2009.

6000|$|... 4. Not {{a slight}} thing to teach, this: perhaps, on the whole, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{be taught in}} {{the whole range of}} teaching. To be taught to read--what is the use of that, if you know not whether what you read is false or true? To be taught to write or to speak--but what is the use of speaking, if you have nothing to say? To be taught to think--nay, what is the use of being able to think, if you have nothing to think of? But to be taught to see is to gain word and thought at once, and both true. There is a vague {{acknowledgment}} of this in the way people are continually expressing their longing for light, until all the common language of our prayers and hymns has sunk into little more than one monotonous metaphor, dimly twisted into alternate languages,--asking first in Latin to be illuminated; and then in English to be enlightened; and then in Latin again to be delivered out of obscurity; and then in English to be delivered out of darkness; and then for beams, and rays, and suns, and stars, and lamps, until sometimes one wishes that, at least for religious purposes, there were no such words as light or darkness in existence. Still, the main instinct which makes people endure this perpetuity of repetition is a true one; only the main thing they want and ought to ask for is, not light, but Sight. It doesn't matter how much light you have if you don't know how to use it. It may very possibly put out your eyes, instead of helping them. Besides, we want, in this world of ours, very often {{to be able to see}} in the dark--that's the great gift of all;--but at any rate to see no matter by what light, so only we can see things as they are. On my word, we should soon make it a different world, if we could get but a little--ever so little--of the dervish's ointment in the Arabian Nights, not to show us the treasures of the earth, but the facts of it.|$|E
