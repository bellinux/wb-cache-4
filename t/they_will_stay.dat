5|$|The {{mating season}} lasts from August to February, and {{coincides with the}} arrival of the rainy season in {{northern}} Australia. The female does the bulk of the nest building, although the male does assist; this is unusual for the genus Malurus. Concealed in grass tussocks or low shrubs, the spherical nest is constructed of dried grasses and usually lined with smaller, finer grasses and hair. Nests examined in southeast Queensland tended to be larger and untidier than those in northern Australia; the former measured 1215cm high by 912cm wide and bore a partly covered 36cm diameter entrance, whereas the latter average around 1013cm in height by 68cm wide with a 24cm entrance. Construction takes around one week, and there may be an interval of up to another seven days before eggs are laid. The eggs produced are white with reddish-brown spots in clutches of three to four, and measure 14.517 x 1013mm; those of subspecies melanocephalus are a little larger than those of cruentatus. The eggs are incubated for two weeks by the female alone. The nestlings are hidden under cover for one week after hatching. The juveniles depend on parents and helpers for approximately one month. They learn to fly between 1112days after hatching. Broods hatched earlier in the season will help to raise the broods hatched later on. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> as a clutch group for the season after hatching.|$|E
25|$|After {{their field}} office experience, agents are usually {{transferred}} to a protective assignment where <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> for three to five years. Following their protective assignment, many agents return to a field office {{for the rest of}} their careers, or opt for a headquarters based assignment located in Washington, D.C. During their careers, agents also have the opportunity to work overseas in one of the agency's international field offices. This typically requires foreign language training to ensure language proficiency when working alongside the agency's foreign law enforcement counterparts.|$|E
25|$|The hen lays {{a clutch}} of 8–16 white eggs, usually in a tree hole or hollow, which are {{incubated}} for 35 days. The sitting hen will leave the nest once a day from 20 minutes to {{one and a half}} hours, and will then defecate, drink water, eat and sometimes bathe. Once the eggs begin to hatch it may take 24 hours for all the chicks to break through their shells. When feral chicks are born they usually stay with their mother for about 10–12 weeks. Their bodies cannot produce all the heat they need, especially in temperate regions, so <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> close to the mother especially at night.|$|E

25|$|Later on, Callie {{eventually}} {{confesses to}} Arizona why the date didn't go well: {{they went to}} an expensive restaurant that she couldn't afford because she has been disowned by her father and now she is broke. Arizona tells her <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> in to eat and they reconcile. Meredith tells Bailey and Derek's idea to Izzie: they give her their wedding. Yang becomes the maid of honor and Meredith serves as Alex's best man. Back at the hospital, Izzie is sad about her hair loss but Alex tells her she doesn't need it to be beautiful. The episode concludes with Izzie having shaved her head and telling Denny to leave as {{she wants to be}} alone with her husband.|$|E
25|$|Dolphins {{are highly}} social animals, often living in pods {{of up to}} a dozen individuals, though pod sizes and {{structures}} vary greatly between species and locations. In places with a high abundance of food, pods can merge temporarily, forming a superpod; such groupings may exceed 1,000 dolphins. Membership in pods is not rigid; interchange is common. Dolphins can, however, establish strong social bonds; <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> with injured or ill individuals, even helping them to breathe by bringing them to the surface if needed. This altruism {{does not appear to}} be limited to their own species. The dolphin Moko in New Zealand has been observed guiding a female Pygmy Sperm Whale together with her calf out of shallow water where they had stranded several times. They have also been seen protecting swimmers from sharks by swimming circles around the swimmers or charging the sharks to make them go away.|$|E
500|$|In some years, this waxwing irrupts {{south of}} its normal {{wintering}} areas, sometimes in huge numbers. The fruit {{on which the}} birds depend in winter varies in abundance from year to year, and in poor years, particularly those following a good crop the previous year, the flocks move farther south until they reach adequate supplies. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> until the food runs out and move on again. In {{what may be the}} largest ever irruption in Europe, in the winter of 2004–2005, {{more than half a million}} waxwings were recorded in Germany alone. This invasion followed an unusually warm, dry breeding season. In 1908, an American flock [...] wide was noted as taking two to three minutes to fly over.|$|E

500|$|... "Dry", or [...] "Closed" [...] diving bells are {{pressure}} vessels for human occupation {{which can be}} deployed from the surface to transport divers to the underwater workplace at pressures greater than ambient. They are equalized to ambient pressure at the depth where the divers will get out and back in after the dive, and are then re-sealed for transport back to the surface, which also generally takes place with controlled internal pressure greater than ambient. During and/or after the recovery from depth, the divers may be decompressed {{in the same way}} as if they were in a decompression chamber, so in effect, the dry bell is a mobile decompression chamber. Another option, used in saturation diving, is to decompress to storage pressure (pressure in the habitat part of the saturation spread) and then transfer the divers to the saturation habitat under pressure (transfer under pressure – TUP), where <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> until the next shift, or until decompressed at the end of the saturation period.|$|E
500|$|Her fourth {{book in the}} series, Journey to a Woman, {{published}} in 1960, again shows parallels between Bannon's own life and her plots. Beth, of Laura's affair in Odd Girl Out, is living {{with her husband and}} children in Southern California. She tries to find Laura again nine years after college, and escapes a deranged woman who has a fixation on her, a reflection of a relationship Bannon had with a beautiful, but [...] "very bewildered and unstable person." [...] Beth writes to an author of lesbian books in New York, and goes to meet her in hope of finding Laura. They have a brief relationship, after which Beth finds Laura married to Jack and with a child, then discovers Beebo as well. A fifth book, The Marriage, also {{published in}} 1960, again addresses issues of love outside the realm of socially acceptable relationships, although it is not primarily about homosexuality. In it, Jack and Laura are friends with a young married couple who discover they are brother and sister, and must decide whether <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> together or conform to societal standards.|$|E
500|$|At Hogwarts, Professor Dumbledore {{announces that}} Alastor [...] "Mad-Eye" [...] Moody {{will be the}} Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for the year, and also that Hogwarts will host the Triwizard Tournament, with a prize of one {{thousand}} gold Galleons. However, only those over 17—the age of majority in the wizarding world—will be allowed to enter. It {{is the first time}} in 202 years that the Triwizard Tournament will be held. Students from Beauxbatons Academy and the Durmstrang Institute, other wizarding academies, will travel to Hogwarts, where <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> for the year, in hopes of competing. At Halloween, the Goblet of Fire picks Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons Academy; Viktor Krum (who is also the Seeker on Bulgaria's Quidditch team) from Durmstrang Institute; and Cedric Diggory from Hogwarts to compete in the tournament. However, it additionally gives a fourth name—Harry Potter—leading to suspicion and indignation from everyone and magically binding Harry to compete. Ron is jealous that Harry is once again in the limelight and refuses to speak to Harry.|$|E

500|$|Aristotle {{provided}} a philosophical {{discussion of the}} concept of a force {{as an integral part of}} Aristotelian cosmology. In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different [...] "natural places" [...] therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their [...] "natural place" [...] (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to [...] "natural motion", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general.|$|E
500|$|Red foxes either {{establish}} stable home ranges within particular {{areas or}} are itinerant with no fixed abode. [...] They use their urine to mark their territories. A male fox raises one hind leg and his urine is sprayed forward {{in front of}} him, whereas a female fox squats down so that the urine is sprayed in the ground between the hind legs. Urine {{is also used to}} mark empty cache sites, used to store found food, as reminders not to waste time investigating them. [...] The use of up to 12 different urination postures allows them to precisely control the position of the scent mark. Red foxes live in family groups sharing a joint territory. In favourable habitats and/or areas with low hunting pressure, subordinate foxes may be present in a range. Subordinate foxes may number one or two, sometimes up to eight in one territory. These subordinates could be formerly dominant animals, but are mostly young from the previous year, who act as helpers in rearing the breeding vixen's kits. Alternatively, their presence has been explained as being in response to temporary surpluses of food unrelated to assisting reproductive success. Non-breeding vixens will guard, play, groom, provision and retrieve kits, an example of kin selection. Red foxes may leave their families once they reach adulthood if the chances of winning a territory of their own are high. If not, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> with their parents, at the cost of postponing their own reproduction.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the rating of coins by their wear, Proof coinage occurs as a separate category. [...] These are specimens struck from polished dies and are often packaged and sold by mints. [...] This is frequently done for Commemorative coins, though annual proof sets of circulating coinage may be issued as well. [...] Unless mishandled, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> in Mint State. [...] Collectors often desire both the proof and regular ("business strike") issues of a coin, though the difference in price between the two may be significant. Additionally, proof coins follow the same 1-70 grading scale as business strike coins, though they use the PR or PF prefix.|$|E

2500|$|On May 30, 2007, the American Heart Association {{launched}} 'Mission: Lifeline', a [...] "community-based initiative {{aimed at}} quickly activating the appropriate {{chain of events}} critical to opening a blocked artery to the heart that is causing a heart attack." [...] It is seen as complementary to the ACC's D2B Initiative. The program will concentrate on patient education to make the public {{more aware of the}} signs of a heart attack and the importance of calling 9-1-1 for emergency medical services (EMS) for transport to the hospital. In addition, the program will attempt to improve the diagnosis of STEMI patients by EMS personnel. According to Alice Jacobs, MD, who led the work group that addressed STEMI systems, when patients arrive at non-PCI hospitals <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> on the EMS stretcher with paramedics in attendance while a determination is made {{as to whether or not}} the patient will be transferred. For walk-in STEMI patients at non-PCI hospitals, EMS calls to transfer the patient to a PCI hospital should be handled with the same urgency as a 9-1-1 call.|$|E
2500|$|The {{police have}} said that the rallies can go ahead with certain conditions, such as not disrupting {{businesses}} and inciting people to topple the government. Also ten days notice must be given to the police or a fine of RM10,000 would be meted out to the organisers as stipulated in the Peaceful Assembly Act 2012. Bersih has met up with police asking the police to ensure the safety and security of the participants, as well not to use tear gas as in previous Bersih rallies. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar has requested that Bersih use Bukit Jalil National Stadium instead of Dataran Merdeka as not to disrupt national day preparations. Kuala Lumpur Mayor Datuk Mhd Amin Nordin Abdul Aziz has refused Bersih's request to hold the rally at Dataran Merdeka. [...] Thousands of police officers have been deployed around Kuala Lumpur in preparation for the rally. Kuala Lumpur City Hall has advised Bersih to postpone their rally for a week, which was refused and also gave alternative venues such as Titiwangsa, Merdeka Stadium and the National Stadium. Bersih has said <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> out Dataran Merdeka, but will protest within its vicinity, which will include resting on the streets of Kuala Lumpur in participants' own sleeping bags. Bersih has advised participants of the rally to bring sleeping bags, blankets and umbrellas, including food and drink during the duration of the rallies. Bersih has set up five gathering points for the participants to start out before heading to Dataran Merdeka: Sogo, Pasar Seni, Dataran Maybank, Brickfields and the National Mosque.|$|E
