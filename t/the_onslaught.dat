5|$|The Byzantine {{victory was}} {{ultimately}} a pyrrhic one, as the devastating {{impact of the}} war left the Byzantines in much weakened state.

5|$|The city of Arcadia in DeSoto County saw extreme damage, {{in spite}} of being {{relatively}} further inland. About 95% of the buildings {{in the downtown area}} saw some sort of damage.

5|$|After the floods, {{helicopters}} airlifted {{relief supplies}} like {{food and water}} to isolated villages, and to residents riding out the floods on their roofs. However, relief coordination was disrupted by damaged communication lines and ongoing rainfall. Rescue boats were used to rescue stranded residents. India's Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda provided 500million rupees (US$15million) to help Andhra Pradesh with flood recovery. Conditions returned to normal within 12days of <b>the</b> <b>onslaught</b> of the rains, {{with the exception of}} minor delays to trains. However, another cyclone struck Andhra Pradesh about three weeks after the flood event, killing over 1,000people.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Mediterranean fruit flies in 1929 {{also contributed to the}} nearly {{complete}} destruction of tourism and citrus in South Florida – two vital economic industries in the region. The federal and state government would spend approximately $7million (1929USD) in eradication efforts. There were foreign and domestic bans on the importation of fruits and vegetables from Florida. Programs established by the New Deal and efforts by Florida governors in mid and late 1930s, particularly David Sholtz, brought relief to the economic slump, but the region remained in an abysmal financial state until <b>the</b> <b>onslaught</b> of American involvement in World War II.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} devastating. Five {{thousand}} French soldiers {{fell in a}} matter of minutes and the entire engagement stood on the brink of disaster. Not only did they face the Russian fire, but the French artillery pounded them as well. Augereau's Corps melted under the withering fire, the bayonets of the Russians, and <b>the</b> <b>onslaught</b> of the cavalry; as they retreated to their own lines, Napoleon was nearly captured at the Eylau churchyard, where he had established a lookout post, but his escort cavalry chased the Russians away.|$|E
5|$|To {{prepare for}} a mission to {{discover}} {{the location of the}} Covenant's homeworld, SPARTAN-II soldiers are recalled to Reach. Two days before the mission was to begin, Covenant forces attack Reach and destroy the colony.

50|$|The {{only way}} of {{avoiding}} <b>the</b> <b>onslaughts</b> of <b>the</b> ghāzīs was to become subjects of the Islamic state. Non-Muslims acquired the status of dhimmīs, living under its protection. Most Christian sources confuse these two stages in the Ottoman conquests. The Ottomans, however, were careful to abide by these rules... Faced with <b>the</b> terrifying <b>onslaught</b> of <b>the</b> ghāzīs, the population living outside {{the confines of the}} empire, in the abode of war, often renounced the ineffective protection of Christian states, and sought refuge in subjection to the Ottoman Empire. Peasants in open country in particular lost nothing by this change.|$|R
5|$|Before Juan made landfall, about 100 people {{evacuated}} around Port Arthur, Texas. In Louisiana, about 6,550 people evacuated, including only 700 of the 1,900 residents on Grand Isle; many {{of those}} who stayed behind there were trapped after <b>the</b> <b>onslaught</b> of the storm surge. About 6,000 people evacuated in Mississippi due to the threat for flooding. Many schools were closed along the coast in Louisiana and Mississippi, and two beaches were closed both sides of the Brownsville, Texas shipping channel. On October 28, governor Edwin Edwards {{declared a state of emergency}} for 13 Louisiana parishes, while officials issued flash flood watches for 42 of Louisiana's 64 parishes. Governor George Wallace also declared a state of emergency for Alabama, and shelters were opened along the coast.|$|E
5|$|Commando Hunt VII {{came to a}} {{close with}} the {{launching}} of the PAVN offensive mentioned above. This conventional attack, backed by armor, heavy artillery, and anti-aircraft units (including SAMs) rolled over the two northernmost provinces of South Vietnam while two smaller offensives were launched in central and southern parts of the country. All U.S. and South Vietnamese air assets were diverted to first slowing, and then halting <b>the</b> <b>onslaught.</b> They were then utilized in the first sustained bombing of North Vietnam since late 1968 (see Operation Linebacker). Interdiction missions were then diverted to carry out an even heavier aerial offensive against the north (see Operation Linebacker II). The end was nigh for Commando Hunt. With the signing of the Paris Peace Accord in March 1973, the Vietnam War finally came to an end for the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Taibbi {{begins the}} work by quoting from his 2008 book The Great Derangement, asserting he {{predicted}} <b>the</b> <b>onslaught</b> of fake {{news and the}} beginnings of the alt-right in society. He argues such societal factors helped set the tone for a climate in which Trump could ascend to the presidency. Taibbi writes that Trump's prior experiences in reality television gave him the tools to triumph in an era of post-truth politics. He criticizes the media for its coverage of Trump, describing how the candidate's inflammatory campaign rhetoric led to increased publicity. The book documents a chronology of the author's thoughts over time as he begins to realize Trump's increasing chances of success. Taibbi reflects back on the events after the election, concluding Trump won because he was able to harness the power of television.|$|E

5|$|The final was {{overshadowed by}} riots {{between the two}} sides – it began when Galatasaray fans stormed a club in Strøget, {{composed}} of Arsenal supporters. Arsenal fans responded by provoking the Galatasaray followers, along with fans of other clubs involved, as retribution for the two Leeds United supporters murdered, before the club's semi-final first leg match against Galatasaray. Four Britons and Turks were apprehended by the Danish riot police following the violence. The turmoil was covered by some British media; tabloid newspaper the Daily Mirror, published images, believed to be the Arsenal fans involved in <b>the</b> <b>onslaught,</b> while BBC News, ITN News and Sky News reported and broadcast television footage of the riots.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>onslaught</b> {{prompted}} Yardley to {{take the}} new ball and replace Compton with his pacemen.

Australia reached 202halfway to the required totalwith 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. England began to become demoralised and their fielding continued to deteriorate. Bradman hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were taken while Bradman was being treated, and Morris had to shield his captain from the strike until the pain had subsided. Australia reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E

Aloha flees <b>the</b> <b>onslaught</b> in his space pod, and lands on an asteroid far away from Little Muu, where he calls for help from his sworn enemy, Universal City Hall. Once again, Robbit is dispatched to help, and manages to free the parts of Little Muu which Kabuki has taken, and ultimately faces Kabuki one-on-one in mortal combat. Robbit defeats Kabuki, resulting in the latter escaping.|$|E

5|$|At around 6:50 am on 5 April, the Viet Cong 5th Division {{moved across}} the Cambodian border to stage the main attack on Lộc Ninh. The Viet Cong assault opened with a heavy barrage of artillery, rocket and mortar fire {{targeting}} {{the headquarters of the}} ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment and the Lộc Ninh district compound. The Viet Cong simultaneously mounted other attacks throughout the ARVN 5th Infantry Division's areas of operations in Lai Khê and Quần Lợi. There was also indirect fire on South Vietnamese positions in Phước Long Province, mainly targeting Phước Vinh, Sông Bé, and Bo Duc. Following the artillery barrage, Viet Cong infantry, supported by about 25 tanks, attacked Lộc Ninh from the west. In the initial assault, they tried to overrun the South Vietnamese regimental compound located {{at the south end of}} the airstrip. Despite the ferocity of <b>the</b> <b>onslaught,</b> South Vietnamese soldiers held their ground and fought desperately to hold the enemy at bay; South Vietnamese artillerymen lowered the muzzles of their 105mm howitzers and fired directly at enemy infantry formations moving through the rubber trees.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, H.D. {{traveled}} to Vienna to undergo analysis with Sigmund Freud. She {{had an interest}} in Freud's theories as far back as 1909, when she read some of his works in the original German. H.D. was referred by Bryher's psychoanalyst due to her apparent paranoia about the rise of Adolf Hitler which indicated another world war, an idea that H.D. found intolerable. The Great War (World War I) had left her feeling shattered. She had lost her brother in action, while her husband suffered effects of combat experiences, and she believed that <b>the</b> <b>onslaught</b> of the war indirectly caused the death of her child with Aldington: she believed it was her shock at hearing the news about the RMS Lusitania that directly caused her child to be stillborn. Writing on the Wall, her memoir about this psychoanalysis, was written concurrently with Trilogy and published in 1944; in 1956 it was republished with Advent, a journal of the analysis, under the title Tribute to Freud.|$|E
5|$|In {{summing up}} the counterattack, US Army {{official}} historian John Miller {{argues that the}} Japanese offensive failed due to poor planning and intelligence. The Japanese commanders underestimated {{the strength of the}} US defenders, but even if XIV Corps had been as weak as the Japanese believed, the force committed to the attack did not include enough troops or artillery to penetrate the well-prepared defenses. In the event, the defenders greatly outnumbered the Japanese force and had far superior artillery support. Miller argues further that the attack might have achieved a degree of success, {{at least in terms of}} inflicting heavy casualties on the US forces, had Hyakutake concentrated his forces early in the attack, rather than cumulatively, in order to achieve a break in the US line, which he might have been able to exploit to penetrate into the rear areas and cause considerable destruction before the US forces regrouped. Nevertheless, this did not happen and ultimately the veteran US troops held their positions despite <b>the</b> <b>onslaught.</b> Miller opines that had the offensive been successful, it would have had a serious affect on the campaign in the Solomons, resulting in a large drain on Allied resources, but would most likely not have altered the wider course of the war.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 5 April, the Viet Cong's 5th Division launched another major ground assault on Lộc Ninh from the west to try {{to break through the}} defenses of the southern compound. American AC-130 and AH-1 Cobra gunships stopped the Viet Cong formations in their tracks, as supporting North Vietnamese tanks were either destroyed or forced to pull back. Despite having suffered many casualties as a result of U.S. air strikes, the Viet Cong continued their assaults well into the evening. In order to deal with <b>the</b> <b>onslaught,</b> Smith continued to direct the AC-130 Spectres against targets around Lộc Ninh. Vinh, on the other hand, was either planning to surrender or desert when he ordered two of his soldiers to open the gates of the command compound at around 10 pm. Throughout the night, the North Vietnamese 69th Artillery Command continued bombarding South Vietnamese positions around Lộc Ninh, as the Viet Cong massed for another assault.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Babs {{entered the}} PAGASA area of responsibility, {{government}} workers began closely tracking {{the storm and}} warned residents to be prepared. PAGASA issued a Public Storm Warning Signal #4 for Catanduanes, with lower warnings issued throughout Luzon and the Visayas. Metro Manila was placed under Public Storm Warning Signal #3 on October22. In Catanduanes, evacuees utilized public schools as an emergency shelter, although many rode out the storm in their homes. The storm halted ferry service throughout the region, stranding thousands. Many residents in Samar slept in buses and cars for two days due to the cancellations. Bus service to the region was also halted. The stock and currency exchanges were closed during the storm. Officials advised residents in Metro Manila to remain indoors; government buildings and schools were closed, while Ninoy Aquino International Airport halted all domestic flights. In addition, 14international flights were canceled. Manila South Harbor also kept all boats at port. Across the Philippines, Babs forced about 400,000people to leave their houses. Many families waited to evacuate until <b>the</b> <b>onslaught</b> of the strongest winds, resulting in additional casualties.|$|E
5|$|The climactic {{underwater}} {{battle was}} shot at Clifton Pier and was choreographed by Hollywood expert Ricou Browning, who had worked on Creature From the Black Lagoon in 1954 and other films. He {{was responsible for the}} staging of the cave sequence and the battle scenes beneath the Disco Volante and called in his specialist team of divers who posed as those engaged in <b>the</b> <b>onslaught.</b> Voit provided much of the underwater gear in exchange for product placement and film tie-in merchandise. Lamar Boren, an underwater photographer, was hired to shoot all of the sequences. United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Charles Russhon, who had already established Eon productions' rapports with the local authorities in Turkey for From Russia with Love (1963) and at Fort Knox for Goldfinger (1964), supplied the experimental rocket fuel used to destroy the Disco Volante. Russhon, using his position, was also able {{to gain access to the}} United States Navy's Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, used to lift Bond and Domino from the water at the end of the film.
