There are the pieces of an old bed out in the loft, {{and they can be}} put together. There's an old corner cupboard out there too, with leaded glass doors, two old solid wooden armchairs, and a funny old chest of drawers with a writing desk in place of the top drawer, all full of yellow old letters and trash. I found it under a pile of old carpet. Then there's a washstand, and also a <b>towel</b> <b>rack</b> up in the garret, and the funniest old table with three claw legs, and a tippy top. One leg is broken off, but I hunted around and found it, and I guess we can fix it on. And there are two more old chairs and a queer little oval table with a cracked swing mirror on it." ...|$|E

40|$|If {{contemporary}} artworks {{are often}} {{considered to be}} puzzles or riddles, then Wilkins Hill take this to a new level. Their recent exhibition Windows impersonating other windows, confronts viewers with an extremely ludic configuration: a spa bath full of almonds, <b>towel</b> <b>racks</b> placed before photos of Martin Heidegger distorted in neat grids, a video of a water tower in a Hamburg park, wooden cut-out speech bubbles and monitors that continuously play interviews with the artists themselves. What does it all mean...|$|R
50|$|One of the {{original}} buildings was a large log cabin. The interior of the cabin, including the accessories, was built entirely from logs and branches of trees. The beds, light fixtures, <b>towel</b> <b>racks,</b> door openers, even the toilet paper holders, are made from logs and tree branches. These pieces were gathered by the brother of Elbert Hubbard, of Roycroft fame, who spent untold hours walking through the woods looking for branches of just the right shape for various purposes in the cabin.|$|R
30|$|Ortophtalic {{unsaturated}} polyester resins {{have in their}} composition phthalic acid, also known as orthophthalic acid, or anhydride, which dissolves itself in alcohol and some other solvents. This type of resin is the most common, because its use is widespread and low cost. The mechanical properties of ortophtalic {{unsaturated polyester}} resins are low. These resins {{can be used in}} the production of buttons and toilet seats, and can also be used in the production of electronics, such as the manufacture of reactor lamps. Other suggestions for usage are: casting handicraft and decorative objects as panels, stained glass, table tops, jewelry, statues, trophies, casting parts for toilets and toilet seats, soap dishes, trash cans, sinks and <b>towel</b> <b>racks.</b> Along with glass fiber, it can be used in composing construction tiles (manual process), domes and shutters (Poliresinas 2012; Amico 2010).|$|R
50|$|The Heated <b>Towel</b> <b>Rack</b> - The contestants must {{install a}} ground fault circuit {{interrupter}} outlet, {{in order to}} install a heated <b>towel</b> <b>rack</b> in their bathrooms. Rob, Matt and Charlene have no problems replacing the original outlet with the GFCI outlet; Dan is momentarily delayed by his color blindness, requiring Natasha to assist him in connecting the wires, while Ajay fails to comprehend the lesson and has to solicit Matt's advice to correctly hook up the outlet. Rob doesn't have any further issues in installing his rack, and passes in short order. Dan has trouble anchoring the <b>towel</b> <b>rack</b> to the wall due to trouble with the wall plugs and stripping screws, but otherwise passes. Charlene fails after failing to drill pilot holes to anchor in the screws and wearing out her screws. Ajay's rack is mounted, but he destroys his drill bit in making pilot holes and he cuts off his wall plugs after failing to fully recess them, so he fails. Matt also admits defeat without installing the <b>towel</b> <b>rack</b> after spending 80 minutes trying to install the anchors, compared to the 5 that he took to change the outlet.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the school is divided into a foyer area and the single classroom. The foyer contains a small washbasin, shelf, and <b>towel</b> <b>rack.</b> The walls are finished in plaster above irregularly-sized wainscoting. The western wall of the classroom is covered in fiberboard painted black, which {{was used as a}} blackboard.|$|E
5000|$|During {{torture and}} abuse sessions, which lasted for 36 hours, Daugherty's attackers tied her up, {{forced her to}} consume feces and urine and detergent; beat her with a <b>towel</b> <b>rack,</b> a vacuum cleaner hose, and a crutch; shaved her head; painted her face with nail polish; forced her to write a fake suicide note; and then stabbed her to death. Six {{suspects}} were charged with criminal homicide, kidnapping and other counts related to her death: ...|$|E

He was a stalwart young man with curling black hair, and a heavy face at its best, but set and sullen now. His first words held a menace: ...|$|R
60|$|By {{the light}} of a candle he {{examined}} the room. A bed, with the covers neatly turned back, revealed snowy pillows and sheets. A worn, but clean, red carpet covered the floor. There was a dresser with a beveled mirror, a washstand with a flowered bowl and pitcher; the two or three chairs were softly upholstered. A little table held books, papers, and a day-old cluster of roses in a jar. There were <b>towels</b> on a <b>rack</b> and soap in a white dish.|$|R
50|$|It {{was later}} {{determined}} that Wright, {{who had been}} hospitalized for a heart condition six weeks before his death, {{suffered a heart attack}} while in the bathtub causing him to slip and fall. He then struck his head on the tap, which rendered him unconscious, and he drowned. Investigators noted that Wright had attempted to stop himself from falling by grabbing a <b>towel</b> <b>rack</b> which was found pulled from the wall. His death was ruled accidental.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the inside of}} the house being larger than the outside, there are doors that reach a height of several yards and at the same time are only a few feet tall. He has a bathroom which he never uses, with a bar of bone-white, rock-hard soap and a <b>towel</b> <b>rack</b> with hard towels attached to the rack. The only usable items in the bathroom are a small bar of regular soap and one normal towel, both brought there by his manservant Albert.|$|E

Towels {{blowing in the}} breeze from a <b>towel</b> <b>rack</b> on the veranda of a tea room in the print allude to the {{returning}} sailing ships. Beside it the mistress {{of the house is}} using a bucket meant for washing the hands and face; her kimono is patterned with riverside threeleaf arrowheads, a plant associated with summer. A housemaid sits inside sewing; an uchiwa hand fan lies on the floor beside her.|$|E
50|$|In 1969, Petty {{switched}} brands to Ford, due to {{his belief}} the Plymouth was not competitive on super-speedways; he wanted a slippery Dodge Daytona but Chrysler executives insisted he stay with Plymouth. He would win 10 races and finish second in points. Won back in 1970 by the sleek new Plymouth Superbird with shark nose and <b>towel</b> <b>rack</b> wing, Petty returned to Plymouth for the 1970 season. This is the car in which Petty is cast in the Pixar film Cars (2006), in which Richard and Lynda Petty had voice roles.|$|E
50|$|Curtis informs Monk {{that there}} has been a {{homicide}} in the Haight-Ashbury district, an astrologer named Allegra Doucet. At the crime scene, Monk and Natalie meet detective #2, Cindy Chow and her psychologist Jasper Perry. Chow's paranoia clearly shows itself when she first is introduced to Monk. Natalie also develops a kinship with Jasper. Monk and Natalie enter the house and find that Allegra is more like a fashion model than an astrologer. Chow explains that someone came into the house last night and stabbed Allegra several times with a letter opener or ice pick. Monk goes into the bathroom and finds that someone broke off the <b>towel</b> <b>rack.</b> As he and Natalie leave the crime scene, he can't help but notice a lack of evidence pointing to forced entry. All that is certain is that Allegra knew the killer, judging from the lack of defensive wounds. They go and talk to Madam Frost, Allegra's elderly competitor just across the street. Frost talks like she didn't exactly like Allegra Doucet, and also says that Allegra was a fraud. Monk realizes that Frost has a motive for murdering her neighbor.|$|E
50|$|The To-Do List - The contestants, {{in their}} final challenge, must {{complete}} all of their incomplete challenges so their rooms are presentable. As with previous years, each task on the to-do list must {{be done in the}} order prescribed therein (roughly corresponding to the order in which they are introduced). Dan hits a snag on the first item (the soundproof headboard), but eventually finishes to work on getting the dug-in spacers out of his bathtub tiles. Matt chews through the first three items easily, though his <b>towel</b> <b>rack</b> returns to frustrate him. He soon completes it to work on grouting his tiles. Rob has time to assist Charlene in her tub drains, though her tub's water intakes still leak. Ajay is doing his tasks out of order (grouting before his cold water pipes are installed), which isn't helping him go any faster; most of his time is focused on the tub's plumbing. By the time Ajay's tub is complete, Matt's entire room is complete, and only decorations remain. Rob's room and Dan's room both finish soon after, while Charlene and Ajay end up cutting corners to meet the deadline.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the contestants}} did the group challenge, the nominators paint their nominees' rooms. Dan's [...] "Tacky Room" [...] (now in red) is criticized for the {{ultimately}} poor job in anchoring in the <b>towel</b> <b>rack</b> and hanging chair. Matt's [...] "Honeyroom Suite for a Guy" [...] (now in brown) is commended for his progress in thinking and planning {{due to the}} work in his room proper, but he admits defeat in his bathroom. Geoff is also concerned for Ajay's safety and his tub installation when his room was inspected; Ajay's room has also been repainted red. Rob (whose room is still orange) admits that injuring himself during the hanging chair challenge would make him the worst, though it was ultimately overlooked by the experts. Gail nominates Ajay as the worst due to him rushing his work and displaying what she felt was an arrogant attitude. Geoff nominates Matt as the worst, feeling that he had showed no understanding of his mistakes in the drain challenge, and that {{the overall quality of}} his work had taken a sharp downturn in the last two episodes. Andrew ultimately sides with Gail in naming Ajay as the worst of the episode, due to having used the jackhammer, a two-handed tool, unsafely with one hand. For homework, Ajay must fix his plumbing while Andrew lectures him on safety. The most improved is Charlene (whose room is in a darker shade of purple) due to finally finishing a project with the hanging chairs, and the fact that her work is correct, if only a bit slow.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a novel heating <b>towel</b> <b>rack</b> control system capable to switch ON/OFF {{according to the}} wetness level of the towel. The wetness level affects the capacitance of the rack sensing part. The system is designed to control the <b>towel</b> <b>rack</b> heating by changing the capacitance to a voltage difference, which drives the switching part of the system. Principles of operation and technical parameters are presented. Results obtained from an experimental testing on a prototype are also revealed...|$|E

Whether they were making a self-conscious artistic statement or simply modifying a <b>towel</b> <b>rack</b> to fit in a small bathroom, IKEA hackers illuminate an emergent practice that provides insights into contemporary changes in creativity. We discuss the motivations for IKEA hacking and explore the impact of information technology on do-it-yourself culture, design, and HCI...|$|E
40|$|Logistics in the {{construction}} industry is a difficult and troubled area with great room for improvement. Planning, preparation, management and control over material flow have become increasingly important for a company in order {{to keep up with the}} competition and reduce their costs. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate and identify possible improvements in the supply management regarding the interior for the sanitary rooms at JM- constructions. To identify possible issues with the supply management three of JMs projects in Uppsala have been analyzed. The result presented in this report shows that there is problems with the current supply management, problems which can be solved by introducing a Construction Consolidation Centre. Furthermore recommendations are given to introduce a pilot project with a Construction Consolidation Centre including: washstand, mirror cabinet, shower screen and <b>towel</b> <b>rack.</b> ...|$|E
