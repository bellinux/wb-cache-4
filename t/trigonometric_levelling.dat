25|$|In {{addition}} to {{the determination of the}} precise location of the trigonometric points the Survey established the precise altitude of a number of fundamental benchmarks by spirit levelling over the years 1839 to 1860. This height survey was completely independent of the position survey, in contrast to modern GPS fixes which give both. The report of the levelling in Ireland had been published in 1855, and it fell to Clarke to prepare the reports for England and Scotland. For England this involved a least squares analysis for the 62 lines of primary levelling with 91 fundamental benchmarks at the end points and at points of intersection. The reference level was the height of Mean Water at Liverpool. 32 end points were connected to tidal stations and therefore the variation of mean water around the country was fixed. The benchmarking proceeded along the roads, but side lines were taken to, and over, many of the mountain top trig points, from which other trig point altitudes were measured by <b>trigonometric</b> <b>levelling.</b> The reports were published in 1861. Unlike the Principal Triangulation report no theory was included in Clarke's levelling reports.|$|E

Methods: The software AutoCADtm was used to calculate the bone wedges, for mathematical comparison of the three main groups, each one of them containing 18 hypothetical bone deformities which angles ranging from 5 to 90 degrees, with 5 degrees intervals between them. Results: In the analysis of 18 deformities, the hypothetical angular bone, the average lengths of the corrective wedges obtained by the trigonometric, circumferential and the exact metods were, respectively, 32. 21 ± 16. 81 mm, 33. 16 ± 18. 63 mm and 35. 22 ± 23. 52 mm.

40|$|In {{order to}} support and {{integrate}} an existing precise levelling control network, in the Travale geothermal area (Tuscany, Italy), a geodetic network {{was set up in}} 1973 to monitor the ground displacements occurring as natural neotectonic activity and induced by steam production in the geothermal field. This network consists of 7 benchmarks located across the main distensive fault system at the SW boundary of a regional graben-shaped tectonic feature that trends in Apenninic direction.

The image map was constructed from a mosaic of 69 Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) images and NOAA AVHRR data. The standard deviation in position in {{the central part of}} the mosaic is ± 125 m. Topographic-glaciologic features were taken from Landsat scenes and represent the best coastline of this region. Surface elevations have been calculated from airborne and ground measurements of either ice thickness (by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium) or barometric pressure. Accuracies vary from ± 2 to ± 7 m, Oversnow <b>trigonometric</b> <b>levelling</b> in the northeastern part of the ice shelf, tied to sea level at the ice front, has given accuracies of ± 1 m.

No tidal corrections have been applied. The overall accuracy of the radar-altimeter-derived elevations is estimated to be better than ± 5 m.

40|$|We present here, {{the results}} of a {{campaign}} of measures carried on between August 25 th and September 8 th, 1999,in Ny-Ålesund, to tie the reference point of the VLBI antenna on the ground marks. A number of Leica retro-targets has been attached (glued) all over the structure of the antenna, and their positions determined (horizontal and vertical angles, along with distance whenever it was possible) with respect to a local reference network. The positions of two points at opposite edges of the elevation axis have also been pinpointed and measured (only horizontal and vertical angles. in this case), to determine the vertical component of the reference point and to measure the offset between the elevation and azimuth axes. The local reference network has been measured using direct and inverse intersection depending on different position and mutual visibility of pillars. Occasionally some pillars have been measured using both methodologies. Furthermore, <b>trigonometric</b> <b>levelling</b> has been performed for connecting the levelling bolts of the six closest pillars to the 3 -D network adjustment results and therefore obtain an univocal determination of the height of the VLBI reference point tight to the altimetric control network. The positions of several markers on the antenna have been measured for 8 antenna azimuth angles, uniformly spread along 360 degrees, in steps of 45 degrees, with the VLBI antenna at the same elevation angle, nearly at the zenith direction. In order to test the position of the elevation axis, we did similar measures on a selected number of markers at different antenna elevation angles, in the range from 90 to 45 degrees, in steps of 15 degrees, for a fixed azimuth angle. The analysis of these measures provide both coordinates for the position of the reference point of the VLBI antenna, and an estimate of the offset between the elevation and azimuth axes in the antenna of Ny-Ålesund. The offset vector from the reference pillar selected (marker 91) is X= 21. 830 ± 0. 001 m and Y= 18. 787 ± 0. 001 m, while the height referred to the levelling bolt of the same pillar (marker 91 b) is Z= 10. 269 ± 0. 001 m.
