5|$|Asian rice was domesticated 8,200–13,500 {{years ago}} in China, with a single genetic origin from the wild rice Oryza rufipogon, in the Pearl River valley region of China. Rice {{cultivation}} <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Hot pot: The Chinese hot pot has {{a history}} of more than 1,000 years. Hot pot {{originated}} during the Chinese Jin Dynasty where the main ingredient was meat, usually beef, mutton or horse. It <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> to Southern China during the Song Dynasty and was further established during the Mongolian Yuan Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{consider this}} one of the earliest, and most deadly, biological attacks in world history, though in the end the Mongols were forced to retreat. Early sources state that the plague began its spread in the spring of 1346 at the River Don near the Black Sea, <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> throughout Russia, the Caucasus, and the Genovese provinces within the year.|$|E

5|$|Disruption in {{the rural}} Congo begun with {{agitation}} by Lumumbists, led by Mulele, among the Pende and Mbundu peoples. By the end of 1963, there was unrest in regions of the central and eastern Congo. The Kwilu Rebellion broke out on 16 January 1964 in the cities of Idiofa and Gungu in Kwilu Province. Further disruption and uprisings <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> to Kivu {{in the east and}} later to Albertville, sparking further insurrection elsewhere in the Congo and the outbreak of the larger Simba Rebellion. The rebels began to expand their territory and rapidly advances northwards, capturing Port-Émpain, Stanleyville, Paulis and Lisala between July and August.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates the Enhydra lineage became {{isolated in the}} North Pacific approximately 2 Mya, giving rise to the now-extinct Enhydra macrodonta and the modern sea otter, Enhydra lutris. The sea otter evolved initially in northern Hokkaidō and Russia, and <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> east to the Aleutian Islands, mainland Alaska, and down the North American coast. In comparison to cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds, which entered the water approximately 50, 40, and 20 Mya, respectively, the sea otter is a relative newcomer to a marine existence. In some respects, though, the sea otter is more fully adapted to water than pinnipeds, which must haul out on land or ice to give birth.|$|E
5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{may also}} play a {{secondary}} role in olfaction, which {{may account for the}} size reduction of the poorly studied upper incisors. The toothcomb may provide pressure to stimulate glandular secretions which are <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> through the fur. Furthermore, the size reduction of the upper incisors may create a gap between the teeth (interincisal diastema) that connects the philtrum (a cleft {{in the middle of the}} wet nose, or rhinarium) to the vomeronasal organ in the roof of the mouth. This would allow pheromones to be more easily transferred to the vomeronasal organ.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 September, Wolfe's army formed a line first with {{their backs to the}} river, <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> out across the Plains with its right {{anchored}} by the bluff along the St. Lawrence and its left by a bluff and thick wood above the St. Charles River. While the regular French forces were approaching from Beauport and Quebec, the Canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the British left flank, sheltering in the trees and scrub; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat, eventually holding the bridge over the St. Charles River.|$|E
5|$|Propaganda {{was used}} by both sides to rally {{domestic}} support and demonize enemies during the First World War. PR activists entered {{the private sector in}} the 1920s. Public relations became established first in the US by Ivy Lee or Edward Bernays, <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> internationally. Many American companies with PR departments spread the practice to Europe after 1948 when they created European subsidiaries {{as a result of the}} Marshall plan.|$|E
5|$|Seed {{release in}} B.prionotes is {{promoted}} by repeated wetting of the cones. The seed separator {{that holds the}} seeds in place is hygroscopic; its two wings pull together then wet, <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> and curl inwards as it dries out again. In doing so, it functions as a lever, gradually prying seeds out of a follicle {{over the course of}} a wet-dry cycle. This adaptation ensures that seed release following fire is delayed until the onset of rain, when germination and seedling survival rates are higher.|$|E
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} is {{a series}} of whorls of branches bearing spikelets, the branches growing appressed to the stem and <b>then</b> <b>spreading</b> out from the stem as the spikelets mature.|$|R

5|$|Streaks {{are common}} across Mars and new ones appear {{frequently}} on steep slopes of craters, troughs, and valleys. The streaks are dark {{at first and}} get lighter with age. The streaks can start in a tiny area, <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> out for hundreds of metres. They have been seen to follow the edges of boulders and other obstacles in their path. The commonly accepted theories include that they are dark underlying layers of soil revealed after avalanches of bright dust or dust devils. Several other explanations have been put forward, including those that involve water or even the growth of organisms.|$|E
5|$|The Welara is a part-Arabian pony breed {{developed}} from the Arabian horse and the Welsh pony. It was originally bred in England by Lady Wentworth at the Crabbet Arabian Stud in the early 1900s from imported Arabian stallions and Welsh pony mares. Breeding <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> throughout North America. In 1981, a breed registry was formed in the United States, and a studbook began to be published. They are used for many disciplines of English riding, and {{are known for their}} refinement, hardiness and spirit.|$|E
5|$|Thigmonastic movements, {{those that}} occur in {{response}} to touch, are used as a defense in some plants. The leaves of the sensitive plant, Mimosa pudica, close up rapidly in response to direct touch, vibration, or even electrical and thermal stimuli. The proximate cause of this mechanical response is an abrupt change in the turgor pressure in the pulvini {{at the base of}} leaves resulting from osmotic phenomena. This is <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> via both electrical and chemical means through the plant; only a single leaflet need be disturbed.|$|E
50|$|In 1472 the friary became observant—its {{community}} {{adopted the}} fashion <b>then</b> <b>spreading</b> across Europe for the strictest observance of the monastic rules — and in 1479 {{it became the}} centre of the Irish Observant Congregation.|$|R

5|$|As soon as {{he could}} walk, Braille spent time playing in his father's workshop. At the age of three, the child was playing with some of the tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local {{physician}} bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin III finally seized Ascalon in 1153, {{which brought}} Egypt into {{the sphere of}} conflict. Jerusalem {{was able to make}} further {{advances}} into Egypt, briefly occupying Cairo in the 1160s. However, relations with the Byzantine Empire were mixed, and reinforcements from Europe were sparse after the disaster of the Second Crusade. King Amalric I of Jerusalem allied with the Byzantines and participated in a combined invasion of Egypt in 1169, but the expedition ultimately failed. In 1171, Saladin, nephew of one of Nur ad-Din's generals, was proclaimed Sultan of Egypt, uniting Egypt and Syria and completely surrounding the crusader kingdom. Meanwhile, the Byzantine alliance ended with the death of emperor Manuel I in 1180, and in 1187, Jerusalem capitulated to Saladin. His forces <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> north to capture all but the capital cities of the Crusader States, precipitating the Third Crusade.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this disastrous expedition, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against Darius the Great. The revolt <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> to Caria and Cyprus. Three years of Persian campaigning across Asia Minor followed, with no decisive effect, before the Persians regrouped and made straight for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus. At the Battle of Lade, the Persians decisively defeated the Ionian fleet and effectively ended the rebellion. Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria, who had supported the revolt. In 492 BC therefore, the first Persian invasion of Greece, would begin {{as a consequence of}} the failed attack on Naxos, and the Ionian Revolt.|$|E
50|$|D. laureola {{reaches a}} height between 0.5-1.5 meters. The habit of this shrub can be upright or decumbent (arched {{at the base}} <b>then</b> <b>spreading</b> upward). The bark is thin and yellow-grey when mature, while {{immature}} stems are green.|$|R

5|$|Malhari Mahatmya {{states that}} Khandoba first {{appeared}} on Champashasti, which was a Sunday, at Premapur, which identified as Pember (Adimailar, Mailarapur) near Bidar. Marathi traditions tell that Khandoba came originally from Premapuri, now Pember in Karnataka, then went to Naldurg, Pali and finally to Jejuri. Sontheimer suggests that the cult of Mailara may have originated in Pember and <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> to Maharashtra, merging with the cult of Khandaka— the patron yaksha (demi-god) of Paithan giving it its distinct Maharashtrain characteristics. Maharashtrains call the god - Kanadya Khanderaya, the god from Karnataka. The cult possibly was spread by Lingayat, Jain and other merchants, associated with Mailara-Khandoba, {{to other parts of}} the Deccan. Besides Mailara, Khandoba is identified with other deities of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, and is called as Mallanna, Mairala, and Mallu Khan. Other traditions like Shakta cults of folk goddesses were assimilated into the Khandoba cult, identifying the goddesses with Khandoba's wives Mhalsa or Banai.|$|E
5|$|The Ionian Revolt was {{triggered}} by the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by Persia to rule them. In 499 BC, the then-tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras, launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer Naxos, {{in an attempt to}} bolster his position in Miletus. The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great. Initially, in 498 BC, the Ionians went on the offensive, supported by troops from Athens and Eretria, capturing Sardis, before suffering defeat at the Battle of Ephesus. The revolt <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> to Caria and Cyprus. Three years of Persian campaigning across Asia Minor followed, with no decisive effect. By 494 BC the Persian army and navy had regrouped, and made straight for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus.|$|E
5|$|With Pink Flamingos (1972) and Reefer Madness (1936) {{making money}} in midnight showings nationwide, a Fox executive, Tim Deegan, {{was able to}} talk {{distributors}} into midnight screenings, starting in New York City on April Fools' Day of 1976. The cult following started shortly after the film began its midnight run at the Waverly Theater in New York City., <b>then</b> <b>spread</b> to other counties in NYC, and to Uniondale, L.I. Rocky Horror was not only found in the larger cities but throughout the United States where many attendees would get in free if they arrived in costume. The western division of the film's release included The U.A. Cinemas in Fresno and Merced, The Cinema J in Sacramento, California, and the Covell in Modesto. In New Orleans, an early organised performance group was active with the release there {{as well as in}} such cities as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Chicago (at the Biograph Theater). Before long nearly every screening of the film was accompanied by a live fan cast.|$|E
