5|$|Denver {{lies within}} the semi-arid, {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen climate classification BSk). It has four distinct seasons and receives a modest {{amount of precipitation}} spread throughout the year. Due to its inland location on the High Plains, {{at the foot of}} the Rocky Mountains, Denver, like all cities along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains, is subject to sudden changes in weather. Contrary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> belief that Denver receives 300 days of sunshine a year, the city can actually expect to receive an average of 115 clear days, 130 partly cloudy days, and 120 cloudy days each year.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since its}} {{establishment}} Girdap served political interests, {{and it was}} later tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Popular</b> Liberal Party of Stefan Stambolov. On the other hand, the Bulgarian Commercial Bank (Balgarska targovska banka), which was also founded in Ruse in 1885, was close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Popular</b> Party. The two banks competed for lending municipal loans and regularly used their political ties in their competition. These relations were often damaging to the Bulgarian treasury, as politicians who were also bank shareholders or somehow related to Girdap awarded contracts based on their personal interest rather {{than that of the}} state. As the Bulgarian economy consolidated {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century and the emerging industry required increasing funds, local banks grew in importance. In 1911 Girdap had a capital of 2 million leva and by 1912 it was the third-largest private bank in the Kingdom of Bulgaria after the Bulgarian Commercial Bank and the Deutsche Bank-related Credit Bank (Kreditna banka). However, Bulgaria's privately owned banking sector remained comparatively small.|$|E
5|$|However, Lauderdale was disliked for his {{opposition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> Queen Caroline, {{which became a}} significant issue in the campaign. His agents claimed that Balfour would have opposed her trial for alleged adultery, but he was portrayed as too close to Liverpool's Tory ministry to properly represent interests of the borough. After four days of polling, Balfour lost by 9 votes (374—363) to the Whig baronet Sir Francis Blake.|$|E

5|$|Irving's {{writings}} on Columbus are {{a mixture of}} history and fiction, a genre now called romantic history. Irving based them on extensive research in the Spanish archives, but also added imaginative elements aimed at sharpening the story.

According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> book, Columbus proved the Earth was round.|$|E

5|$|Smetana had {{virtually}} no precursors in Czech opera apart from František Škroup, whose works had rarely lasted beyond one or two performances. In his mission {{to create a new}} canon, rather than using traditional folksong Smetana turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> dance music of his youth, especially the polka, to establish his link with the vernacular. He drew on existing European traditions, notably Slavonic and French, but made only scarce use of arias, preferring to base his scores on ensembles and choruses.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}}'s {{main focus}} {{is the death}} scene of the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Ulrich von Jungingen; another central figure is the Lithuanian duke Vytautas (Witold), dressed in red with a raised sword. The painting has been both hailed and criticized for its complexity. It is one of Matejko's most recognizable works, and has likely contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> image {{of the battle of}} Grunwald, and its enduring fame in Polish consciousness.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{church of}} St. James is also {{located near the}} centre of Taunton quite close to St. Mary Magdalene. The oldest parts of St. James Church are early 14th-century, and there are {{fragments}} of 15th-century glass in the west end. Like St. Mary's {{it also has a}} sandstone tower but built to a much less impressive design. The tower was also, like St. Mary's, rebuilt in the 19th century– in this case thought to be due to building defects in the original tower. The church backs onto the County Ground and forms a familiar backdrop <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> cricket ground.|$|E
5|$|The press, the radio, and the {{television}} also contributed to these discussions by hosting meetings where students and young workers could ask questions of writers such as Goldstucker, Pavel Kohout, and Jan Prochazka and political victims such as Josef Smrkovský, Zdenek Hejzlar, and Gustav Husak. Television also broadcast meetings between former political prisoners and the communist leaders from the secret police or prisons where they were held. Most importantly, this new {{freedom of the press}} and the introduction of television into the lives of everyday Czechoslovak citizens moved the political dialogue from the intellectual <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> sphere.|$|E

5|$|Eliot {{started writing}} East Coker in 1939, and {{modelled}} the poem after Burnt Norton {{as a way}} to focus his thoughts. The poem served as a sort of opposite <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> idea that The Waste Land served as an expression of disillusionment after World War I, though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. The poem focuses on life, death, and continuity between the two. Humans are seen as disorderly and science is viewed as unable to save mankind from its flaws. Instead, science and reason lead mankind to warfare, and humanity needs to become humble in order to escape the cycle of destruction. To be saved, people must recognize Christ as their savior as well as their need for redemption.|$|E
