Quiney held several municipal offices in the corporation of Stratford-upon-Avon, the highest being chamberlain in 1621 and 1622, but was also fined for various minor offences.|$|E

The 1920s {{also saw the}} opening of shops in New York and Paris. Bloomberg Businessweek opined that Dunhill prefigured the modern luxury goods market with its international ambitions. In 1924 the company launched the Unique lighter, a product that Dunhill and his brother Herbert had much interest in developing, and was the world's first lighter that could be operated with just one hand.|$|E
5|$|Plague doctors traversed {{the streets}} {{diagnosing}} victims, {{although many of}} them had no formal medical training. Several public health efforts were attempted. Physicians were hired by city officials and burial details were carefully organized, but panic spread through the city and, out of the fear of contagion, people were hastily buried in overcrowded pits. The means of transmission of the disease were not known but thinking they might be linked to the animals, the City Corporation ordered a cull of dogs and cats. This decision may have affected the length of the epidemic since those animals could have helped keep in check the rat population carrying the fleas which transmitted the disease. Thinking bad air was involved in transmission, the authorities ordered giant bonfires to be burned in the streets and house fires to be kept burning night and day, in hopes that the air would be cleansed. Tobacco was thought to be a prophylactic and it was later said that no London <b>tobacconist</b> had died from the plague during the epidemic.|$|E

In 1851, it expanded again to include cigarette makers, and in 1881 it took another name, the United Operative <b>Tobacconists</b> throughout the Kingdom. [...] For much of this period, the union was based in Liverpool at the houses of its successive general secretaries, but in 1918 it relocated to London.|$|R

A second factory was opened, in Liverpool, in 1923. The company went public in 1934.|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} my thesis is The National Tobacconists’ {{effect on the}} {{consumer}} behaviour in Hungary. I have been following with attention the news and changes which are {{in connection with the}} smoking, purchasing habits and <b>tobacconist’s</b> since June of 2013 as an owner of The National <b>Tobacconist’s.</b> I have chosen this theme not only because of its actuality, but I have chosen it in order to support the advancement of my business enterprise thereby I can get acquainted with the smoking habit of the customers. Consequently, the main target of my thesis is the analysis of the effects on the consumer attitude of the opening of The National <b>Tobacconist’s.</b> In the literature review the short history of the dicovery and the spread of the tobacco, the economic effect, the structure of the Hungarian tobacco economic units, the smokers customs have been introduced on the score of surveys. Henceforward I have observed the regulations which led to the opening of the National <b>Tobacconist’s,</b> the domestic turnover of the black market and {{with the opening of the}} <b>tobacconist’s</b> what kind of changes have been made on the tobacco market.

25|$|Fred and John Lillywhite, as well {{as their}} elder brother, James (b. 1825), all went into {{business}} as sports outfitters. Perhaps because of this multiplicity of Lillywhites, latter day accounts of their non-cricketing activities sometimes conflict as to who did what. What is clear is that Fred was a manager, probably from 1848 to 1855, in the firm of Lillywhite Brothers, a <b>tobacconist</b> and sports outfitter in Islington, then on the outskirts of London.|$|E
25|$|The Lillywhites' {{father died}} in 1854 and was buried in Highgate Cemetery, North London. The {{following}} year Fred went into partnership with the Sussex all-rounder, John Wisden (1826–84), with whom he established a <b>tobacconist</b> and outfitter in New Coventry Street, near Leicester Square, in the West End of London. This partnership did not survive the tour to the United States and Canada in 1859 that Lillywhite (though not himself a player) organised and of which Wisden was a prominent member.|$|E

Her mother, Margaret O'Keefe (1888-1936), was Irish-American, and her father, Samuel David Benaderet (1884-1954), a Turkish Sephardic emigrant, was a <b>tobacconist</b> who {{relocated}} the family from New York to San Francisco, California in 1915 after his participation in the Panama–Pacific International Exposition.

500|$|Donnell's {{goal was}} that the Monadnock would [...] "not only look as it {{originally}} did, it [...] also live as it used to", and he sought tenants for the street-level shops that were similar to their 19th-century occupants. Shop windows were cleared of all signs and obstructions to preserve intended view from the corridor through to the street. Fluorescent lighting was prohibited and only gold leaf lettering on the glass was permitted for signage. Shops, all individually owned, were selected to fit the architectural character of the building. A florist, for example, was chosen that evoked a turn-of-the-century atmosphere, {{as well as a}} barbershop with vintage fixtures and decor. A <b>tobacconist</b> with oak furnishings, a pen shop with glass cases, a shoe-shine stand, and other service establishments represented, in Donnell's words, [...] "the kind of small-scale entrepreneurs who occupied those spaces {{at the turn of the}} century, the kind of people who bring vitality and life to a building because they have a stake in it." ...|$|E

500|$|In Kiltearn {{there had}} been a settlement, an old ferm toun known as Drummond (Drumainn), near the {{location}} of Evanton, and several lordly residences, such as Foulis, Novar and Balconie Castle. [...] In 1807, the local landowner Alexander Fraser was clearing his estates to make way for sheep, and founded Evanton as a planned settlement for the relocated residents, [...] modestly naming it after his son. To this day, {{in the words of one}} historian, Evanton [...] "remains today an attractive example of a well planned, regularly laid out estate village". The Reverend Thomas Munro expressed similar sentiments in the 1840s, when he wrote that [...] "the village was built on a waste of land, and differs from all others in the country by its regular and neat appearance". The village suffered from the severe famine that plagued the Highlands in the 1840s. There was a riot in the village in 1846, because the authorities continued to export grain despite the failure of the previous year's potato crop; similar riots occurred in Rosemarkie, Balintraid and Avoch. In 1847, there was near starvation in the village, and the villagers managed to maintain themselves on turnips. However, the village population recovered; by the beginnings of the First World War, Evanton had taken much of its current physical shape, and at this point in time contained businesses as diverse as a <b>tobacconist</b> and a bicycle shop, both of which have subsequently disappeared.|$|E

During this time, Burgess's father worked as a bookkeeper for a beef market by day, and in the evening played piano at a public house in Miles Platting. After his father married the landlady of this pub, Margaret Dwyer, in 1922, Burgess was raised by his father and stepmother. By 1924 the couple had established a <b>tobacconist</b> and off-licence business with four properties. On 18 April 1938, Joseph Wilson died from cardiac failure, pleurisy, and influenza at the age of 55, leaving no inheritance despite his apparent business success.

2500|$|In August 1889, several {{artists of}} the Heidelberg School staged the 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition at Buxton's Rooms, Swanston Street, {{opposite}} the Melbourne Town Hall. The exhibition's three principal artists were Charles Conder, Tom Roberts and Arthur Streeton, with minor contributions from Frederick McCubbin, National Gallery students R. E. Falls and Herbert Daly, and sculptor Charles Douglas Richardson, who exhibited five sculpted impressions. Most of the 183 works included in the exhibition were painted on wooden cigar-box panels, measuring 9 by 5 inches (23 × 13cm), hence {{the name of the}} exhibition. Louis Abrahams, a member of the Box Hill artists' camp, scrounged most of the panels from his family's <b>tobacconist</b> shop. In order to emphasise the small size of the paintings, they were displayed in broad Red Gum frames, some left unornamented, others decorated with verse and small sketches, giving the works an [...] "unconventional, avant garde look".
