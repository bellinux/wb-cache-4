They get engaged and Archie begins subtly controlling Peggy. They marry, but it ends {{a few hours later}} when it is revealed that Archie lied to Ronnie about her infant daughter's death. Peggy has Archie evicted from The Queen Vic, and tries unsuccessfully to coerce Phil into murdering him. Peggy files for divorce and Archie plots revenge on the entire Mitchell family. When Peggy loses the bail surety she has paid on behalf of her daughter Sam (who breaks the conditions of her bail following coercion from Archie), the Mitchells are forced to use The Queen Victoria to gain a collateral Loan from Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Archie blackmails Ian to sell the loan to him, and when the Mitchells are unable to meet <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> <b>repayment,</b> Archie evicts them and assumes ownership of the pub. However, Archie is murdered on Christmas Day 2009 by an unknown assailant. Peggy grieves for Archie, but she and various other members of her family become suspects for his murder. Following a police enquiry, Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) is posthumously found guilty of the murder, though unbeknown to everyone, the actual murderer is Bradley's wife, Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), after Archie raped her. In his will, Archie leaves The Queen Vic to Roxy, who reinstates Peggy.|$|E

[...] After often only one or two days of acclimatisation and processing on arrival, properties were allocated by ballot and the settlers transported to their selections. [...] After a period of establishment, the settlers were required to repay a 30-year loan (not exceeding £1,000) provided by the Agricultural Bank, and at the completion of <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> the settler would have freehold title to the property. [...] They were paid 10 shillings per day during the land clearing phase and offered a £10 loan for the purchase of household and agricultural equipment. [...] The loan was interest-only for the first five years. [...] The communities (or groups) typically comprised between twelve and twenty families, and cleared land, built fences and established their farms in areas which had previously been unable to attract settlers.|$|E

50|$|Fixed Rate: Fixed rate is {{a stable}} rate of interest. If you {{negotiate}} a fixed rate with your loan providers, {{you will be}} charged the same interest rate throughout your repayment period. <b>The</b> <b>Loan</b> <b>Repayment</b> Estimator uses a fixed rate of prime + 5%.

50|$|Floating rate: Floating rate is {{a rate of}} {{interest}} that varies over time with the prime rate. If you negotiate a floating rate with your loan providers, the interest you are charged during repayment of your loan will increase and decrease along with the prime rate. <b>The</b> <b>Loan</b> <b>Repayment</b> Estimator uses a floating rate of prime + 2.5%. For example, if the prime rate is 4.5%, floating rate on <b>the</b> <b>Loan</b> <b>Repayment</b> Estimator will be 7% (4.5% + 2.5% = 7%).|$|E

50|$|These loans {{have been}} {{described}} as tax-disadvantaged, on the theory that the 401(k) contains before-tax dollars, but <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> is repaid with after-tax dollars.

From your perspective as the borrower, this is identical to a standard loan where you are not taxed when you get <b>the</b> <b>loan,</b> but you have to pay it back with taxed dollars. However, the interest portion of <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> <b>repayments,</b> which are essentially additional contributions to the 401(k), are made with after-tax funds but they do not increase the after-tax basis in the 401(k).
