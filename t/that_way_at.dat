She was “sorry because it was never meant in that context at all, and it was never said in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>at</b> all.

25|$|The F3000 race at the Birmingham Superprix {{was just}} as sunny as the two {{previous}} ones, there was a carnival atmosphere. But not certainly for Martin Donnelly as he {{got a lot of}} attention for wrong reasons. During the qualifying session after a spin at the Holts Corner, he abandoned his car, and watched with horror as Erico Cheli t-boned his car. His Eddie Jordan Racing team worked very hard to get the Reynard car repaired, and thankfully he started the race with an incomplete livery. His team mate Jean Alesi fought throughout the race with Marco Apicella. It stayed <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>at</b> the end, with Alesi beating Apicella by a slender margin. Donnelly came back to finish third.|$|E

25|$|In 1851, {{after the}} fifteenth {{asteroid}} (Eunomia) had been discovered, Johann Franz Encke {{made a major}} change in the upcoming 1854 edition of the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch (BAJ, Berlin Astronomical Yearbook). He introduced a disk (circle), a traditional symbol for a star, as the generic symbol for an asteroid. The circle was then numbered in order of discovery to indicate a specific asteroid (although he assigned ① to the fifth, Astraea, while continuing to designate the first four only with their existing iconic symbols). The numbered-circle convention was quickly adopted by astronomers, and the next asteroid to be discovered (16 Psyche, in 1852) was the first to be designated in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>at</b> the time of its discovery. However, Psyche was given an iconic symbol as well, as were a few other asteroids discovered {{over the next few years}} (see chart above). 20 Massalia was the first asteroid that was not assigned an iconic symbol, and no iconic symbols were created after the 1855 discovery of 37 Fides. That year Astraea's number was increased to ⑤, but the first four asteroids, Ceres to Vesta, were not listed by their numbers until the 1867 edition. The circle was soon abbreviated to a pair of parentheses, which were easier to typeset and sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades, leading to the modern convention.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1984, Double Trouble began {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album, Couldn't Stand the Weather, at the Power Station, with John Hammond as executive producer and engineer Richard Mullen. Layton later recalled working with Hammond: [...] "He {{was kind of}} like a nice hand on your shoulder, as opposed to someone that jumped in and said, 'Let's redo this, let's do that more.' He didn't get involved in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>at</b> all. He was a feedback person." [...] As the sessions began, Vaughan's cover of Bob Geddins' [...] "Tin Pan Alley" [...] was recorded while audio levels were being checked. Layton remembers the performance: [...] "...we did probably the quietest version we ever did up 'til that point. We ended it and [...] said, 'That's the best that song will ever sound,' and we went, 'We haven't even got sounds, have we?' He goes, 'That doesn't matter. That's the best you'll ever do that song.' We tried it again five, six, seven times—I can't even remember. But it never quite sounded like it did that first time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Daisy Adair (Laura Harris): (before 1915–1938) A spoiled {{actress who}} often tells stories about her (alleged) sexual escapades with classic film stars. She died on December 13, 1938 of asphyxiation/smoke {{inhalation}} in Marietta, Georgia, though she originally claimed this {{occurred on the}} set of Gone with the Wind. Her last thought before she died was, [...] "Why has no one ever loved me?" [...] Daisy is sent from New York City to Seattle in episode six as a replacement when Betty leaves. She is traumatically affected by violent male deaths committed against defenseless women, and although Roxy yelled at her for tampering with a crime scene after such a reap, Daisy then revealed to Mason that she had a sister who (presumably) died <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> <b>At</b> the end of Season 2, Daisy begins to acquire a reputation as a [...] "bad luck charm" [...] when Ray accuses her of killing people. When Ray's soul is transformed into a graveling, she enigmatically states in that and the next episode that she's [...] "seen it before" [...] and that it's [...] "happening again." [...] Daisy is recognized in the last episode by an elderly man in Der Waffle Haus while she is dressed as a police officer for Halloween; as stated in that episode, on Halloween, all reapers look as they did when alive.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked by}} The Advocate in a February 12, 2009 {{interview}} about viewer concern among the LGBT community that Reese would leave Bianca for Zach and likely has romantic feelings for him, All My Children executive producer Julie Hanan Carruthers responded, [...] "First of all, it’s not true. I think what’s confused in Reese’s head is she has misinterpreted a friendship. Zach {{is one of}} the [...] people who have not kicked her to the curb, so to speak, in Pine Valley." [...] Carruthers said that Reese is a confused and insecure person. [...] "She has never wavered in her commitment to Bianca," [...] she said. [...] "It’s solid, Reese has just had a lot of emotional stuff hit. Her family is rejecting and judging her... in both her family and Bianca’s." [...] In specific response to viewers being upset at the appearance that Reese was considering leaving Bianca for Zach, Carruthers stated, [...] "She is not considering it. That’s the audience rewriting what’s there. It’s not being written <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>at</b> all. Reese has never wavered in what she wants." [...] Carruthers acknowledged that Reese leaving Bianca for a man would upset viewers, but that [...] "it's never been about that". [...] "I don’t know how to stress this more," [...] she said. [...] "Never has she played a moment of, 'I want Zach more than I want Bianca,' or 'I would leave Bianca for Zach.' He has literally just been a friend. Look, we tantalize in this genre. We do it whether we do it with heterosexual or homosexual couples. It’s what the genre is." ...|$|E
