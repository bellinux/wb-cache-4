5|$|Another way enzyme {{malfunctions}} {{can cause}} disease comes from germline mutations in genes coding for DNA repair enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are {{less able to}} repair mutations in their genomes. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> slow accumulation of mutations and results {{in the development of}} cancers. An example of such a hereditary cancer syndrome is xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes the development of skin cancers in response to even minimal exposure to ultraviolet light.|$|E
5|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, and breathing, because the {{external}} hydrostatic pressure of the water provides support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion diuresis compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E

The animal's sense organ is altered when it detects an object. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> perceptual {{change in the}} animal's seat of sensation, which Aristotle {{believed}} was the heart, not as we now think the brain. This in turn causes {{a change in the}} heart's heat, which causes a quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration {{in the heat of the}} heart also causes a change in the consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.|$|E

5|$|After {{breaking}} up with Owen, Cristina continues to excel at surgery and becomes de facto chief of cardio. Although supportive of Meredith's choice to become a mother, Cristina points {{out the fact that}} it has hurt Meredith's career and clinical judgement. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> wedge in their friendship. Grey attempts to catch up professionally with a research trial, but the divide widens when Cristina's trial overshadows Grey's and steals Grey's resources. When Dr. Shane Ross, a second-year resident, stands up to Meredith for her, Cristina gives Shane a kiss. Later, she begins sleeping with him, as well as becoming his mentor and passing on the skills learned from Altman. Cristina's project is immensely successful and she is informed that she could be considered for the Harper Avery award from her 3-D printing of a heart conduit. Grey and Yang reconcile when Grey acknowledges that Yang is correct, she has surpassed Grey, and that Grey is jealous of Yang's professional freedom and success, while her own is hampered by her family.|$|E

Unfortunately, George had the propane for Li'l Sebastian's eternal flame, which results in later confusion behind the scenes, that Leslie and Ben struggle to fix throughout the night. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is sent to get propane for the flame but buys lighter fluid instead; <b>this</b> <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> huge fireball to shoot into the air when Ron lights it, which singes off his eyebrows, part of his mustache and hair. Leslie and Ben are relieved, however, when the crowd applauds in the belief the fireball was staged. Entertainment 720's show also proves to be a hit with the crowd, which makes Tom further contemplate quitting his job.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, blood will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E

5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before <b>this</b> <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, is injected {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E
5|$|Known as viremia, the {{presence}} of a virus in the bloodstream enables it to be widely distributed throughout the body. Poliovirus can survive and multiply within the blood and lymphatics for long periods of time, sometimes as long as 17 weeks. In a small percentage of cases, it can spread and replicate in other sites, such as brown fat, the reticuloendothelial tissues, and muscle. This sustained replication causes a major viremia, and leads to the development of minor influenza-like symptoms. Rarely, this may progress and the virus may invade the central nervous system, provoking a local inflammatory response. In most cases, <b>this</b> <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> self-limiting inflammation of the meninges, the layers of tissue surrounding the brain, which is known as nonparalytic aseptic meningitis. Penetration of the CNS provides no known benefit to the virus, and is quite possibly an incidental deviation of a normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus spreads to the CNS are poorly understood, but it appears to be primarily a chance event—largely independent of the age, gender, or socioeconomic position of the individual.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} causes {{of an urban}} heat island (UHI); for example, dark {{surfaces}} absorb significantly more solar radiation, which causes urban concentrations of roads and buildings to heat more than suburban and rural areas during the day; materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs, such as concrete and asphalt, have significantly different thermal bulk properties (including heat capacity and thermal conductivity) and surface radiative properties (albedo and emissivity) than the surrounding rural areas. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> change in the energy budget of the urban area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. Another major reason {{is the lack of}} evapotranspiration (for example, through lack of vegetation) in urban areas. With a decreased amount of vegetation, cities also lose the shade and cooling effect of trees, and the removal of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Thermal energy causes {{some of the}} {{molecules}} at {{the outer edge of}} the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|When airways are damaged, air {{can escape}} {{from them and}} be trapped in the {{surrounding}} tissues in the neck (subcutaneous emphysema) and mediastinum (pneumomediastinum); if it builds up to high enough pressures there, it can compress the airways. Massive air leaks from a ruptured airway can also compromise the circulation by preventing blood from returning to the heart from the head and lower body; <b>this</b> <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> potentially deadly reduction {{in the amount of}} blood the heart is able to pump out. Blood and other fluids can build up in the airways, and the injury can interfere with the patency of the airway and interfere with its continuity. However, even if the trachea is completely transected, the tissues surrounding it may hold it together enough for adequate air exchange to occur, at least at first.|$|E
5|$|When any {{aircraft}} {{passes the}} critical mach {{of that particular}} airframe, the centre of pressure shifts rearwards. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> pitch down moment on the aircraft if the centre of gravity remains where it was.

This could have been countered by the use of trim controls, but at such high speeds this would have dramatically increased drag. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of gravity, effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control.|$|E
5|$|However, Kerrigan {{does not}} perish, {{and as the}} second chapter begins, the player is charged by the Zerg hive mind, the Overmind, to protect a {{chrysalis}} it claims will be its greatest creation.

Raynor, drawn to Char by psychic dreams cast by Kerrigan during her incubation, fails {{in an attempt to}} rescue her, but is spared as Kerrigan does not see him as a threat, and possibly due to any lingering affection she had for him. After breaking into a Terran science vessel and reversing the neural conditioning from her training as a psionic agent, Kerrigan is able to sense the presence of the Protoss fleet commander Tassadar on Char. Tassadar diverts Kerrigan's attention long enough for his companion Zeratul to assassinate Zasz, one of the Zerg commanders, with psionic energies the Zerg are unfamiliar with. <b>This</b> <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> temporary mental link between Zeratul and the Overmind, who uses this momentary contact with Zeratul's memories to locate the Protoss homeworld Aiur.
