5|$|The Stuarts {{used their}} {{connection}} with Fleance and {{his marriage to}} the Welsh princess to claim a genealogical link with the legendary King Arthur. This, they hoped, would strengthen the legitimacy of their claim to the throne. In 1722, however, Richard Hay, a Scottish historian, presented strong evidence <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> James not a descendant of Fleance, but also that neither Fleance nor Banquo ever even existed. Most modern scholars now agree that Fleance is not a real historical figure.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuation}} of Octel Freight Traffic until 1993 ensured <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> the trackbed kept whole, {{but the majority}} of the rail infrastructure was still in situ. As such, the Amlwch line was well suited to preservation as a heritage railway, or see a return of mainline services. The continued role of Llangefni as an administrative and commercial centre led British Rail and Gwynedd County Council to consider restoring passenger services between Llangefni and Bangor in the late 1980s, but the idea was turned down.|$|E
5|$|This {{view was}} {{the norm for}} some time after Boece and is {{reflected}} in the Statistical Accounts for Aberlemno. It took until the mid-19th century for it to be pointed out <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> there no evidence that the stones were Scandinavian in origin, there was also ample evidence that the stones were Pictish/Scottish in origin. The kirkyard stone predates the Battle of Barry by three centuries and the most widely accepted interpretation is that the stone commemorates the Pictish victory at the historical Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 AD.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to London briefly in mid-1939, the couple returned to America, Leigh to film the final takes for Gone with the Wind, and Olivier {{to prepare for}} filming of Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca—although the couple had hoped to appear in it together. Instead, Joan Fontaine was selected {{for the role of}} Mrs de Winter, as the producer David O. Selznick thought <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> she more suitable for the role, but that it was best to keep Olivier and Leigh apart until their divorces came through. Olivier followed Rebecca with Pride and Prejudice, in the role of Mr. Darcy. To his disappointment Elizabeth Bennet was played by Greer Garson rather than Leigh. He received good reviews for both films and showed a more confident screen presence than he had in his early work. In January 1940 Olivier and Esmond were granted their divorce. In February, following another request from Leigh, her husband also applied for their marriage to be terminated.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, {{calculations}} by the Polish mathematician Stanislaw Ulam and his collaborator Cornelius Everett, {{along with}} confirmations by Fermi, had shown <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> Teller's earlier {{estimate of the}} quantity of tritium needed for the H-bomb a low one, but that even with higher amounts of tritium, the energy loss in the fusion process would be too great to enable the fusion reaction to propagate. However, in 1951 Teller and Ulam made a breakthrough, and invented a new design, proposed in a classified March 1951 paper, On Heterocatalytic Detonations I: Hydrodynamic Lenses and Radiation Mirrors, for a practical megaton-range H-bomb. The exact contribution provided respectively from Ulam and Teller to {{what became known as}} the Teller–Ulam design is not definitively known in the public domain, and the exact contributions of each and how the final idea was arrived upon has been a point of dispute in both public and classified discussions since the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The impenetrable Venusian {{cloud cover}} gave science fiction writers free rein to {{speculate}} on conditions at its surface; {{all the more so}} when early observations showed <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> it similar in size to Earth, it possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was frequently depicted as warmer, but still habitable by humans. The genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s, at a time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus, but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions. Findings from the first missions to Venus showed the reality to be quite different, and brought this particular genre to an end. As scientific knowledge of Venus advanced, so science fiction authors tried to keep pace, particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform Venus.|$|E

25|$|Years later, Lawler {{appeared}} as {{himself in the}} Kaufman biopic Man on the Moon; the movie revealed that Lawler's feud with Kaufman had been kayfabe (staged). Lawler later claimed <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> his entire feud with Kaufman staged, but the two were actually very good friends.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{those who}} {{recognise}} {{the significance of}} R.A. Kartini argue <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> she a feminist who elevated {{the status of women}} in Indonesia, she was also a nationalist figure, with new ideas, who struggled on behalf of her people and {{played a role in the}} national struggle for independence.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to acknowledge <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> it a monumental move for so many women {{to be in the}} ranks and forefront of a movement, but they also went beyond that and made their own demands. They participated in the collective struggle, but also made sure their struggle was heard, acknowledged, and validated.|$|E

25|$|Modified Front End was an {{extremely}} cost effective improvement given that it allowed the VR to defer new locomotive construction through improvements to existing locomotives {{that at the time}} cost just £140 ($280) per locomotive. It was so successful <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> the entire A2 fleet converted during 1936–39, but also the C, K, N, S and X class locomotive fleets, and its principles were also incorporated into the design of all subsequent steam locomotives built for VR.|$|E
25|$|Abu Rawash is {{the site}} of Egypt's most northerly pyramid (other than the ruins of Lepsius pyramid number one)— the mostly ruined Pyramid of Djedefre, son and {{successor}} of Khufu. Originally it was thought that this pyramid had never been completed, but the current archaeological consensus is <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> it completed, but that it was originally about {{the same size as the}} Pyramid of Menkaure, which would have placed it among the half-dozen or so largest pyramids in Egypt.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of whether or not salsa is anything more than Cuban music has been argued over for more than thirty years. Initially, not much difference could be seen. Later it became clear <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> New York salsa different from popular music in Cuba, but salsa in Venezuela, Colombia and other countries could also be distinguished. It also seems clear that salsa has receded from the great position it achieved in the late 1970s. The reasons for this are also much disputed.|$|E
25|$|Black liberation {{theology}} was first systematized by James Cone and Dwight Hopkins. They {{are considered the}} leading theologians of this system of belief, although now there are many scholars who have contributed {{a great deal to}} the field. In 1969, Cone published the seminal work that laid the basis for black {{liberation theology}}, Black Theology and Black Power. In the book, Cone asserted <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> black power not alien to the Gospel, it was, in fact, the Gospel message for all of 20th century America.|$|E
25|$|He started {{poorly in}} the first Test at Brisbane with scores of 33 and 0, but in the second Test in Adelaide he would improve on this with 177 and 41. During the fourth Test at Melbourne he made an {{aggressive}} 145. In the fifth and final Test at Sydney, Vaughan scored a match-winning 183 before being given out (wrongfully) lbw to Andy Bichel, as replays showed <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> the ball missing leg stump but it was going over the stumps by a fair margin.|$|E
25|$|Cotter and Kilner argue <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>is</b> social {{immunity}} {{a useful}} concept {{to use when}} studying the major transitions in evolution (see below), that the origin of social immune systems might be considered a major transition itself.|$|R

25|$|Almost {{immediately}} criticism {{began in}} Australia; the Sydney Morning Herald immediately {{took issue with}} the fact <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> captain Ricky Ponting outstrategised by his opposite number Vaughan, but the side in itself was too old and simply did not score the runs when they were needed. The Age of Melbourne criticised the team for opening their big mouths once too often, hitting at Australia's earlier whitewash boast. Psychological warfare, The Age went on to state, is great when it works, but when it backfires those who are responsible ought {{to be brought to}} account.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, the {{population}} of the District of Columbia rose by about 30 percent to 861,000 people. The terrible overcrowding and traffic jams in the city convinced many <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> a subway system needed, but that vastly enlarged and improved highways were required as well. Post-war projections showed D.C. losing population to the suburbs, and planning for nuclear war emphasized moving many federal agencies into the suburbs as a means of reducing the government's vulnerability to attack. These and other factors meant that new superhighways would be needed to bring workers into town to work, and to move them from agency to agency throughout the day quickly and efficiently.|$|E
25|$|Hunter, unlike Slide, {{was located}} close to {{settlements}} and saw considerable exploitation of its forest resources. Retired Colonel William Edwards {{was so successful}} harvesting hemlock bark for tanning during the mid-19th century {{in what is now}} the ski area <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> the ridge named the Colonel's Chair in his honor, the village of Hunter was briefly renamed Edwardsville. On {{the other side of the}} mountain, the West Virginia-based Fenwick Lumber Company logged Hunter and Southwest Hunter so thoroughly between 1903 and 1917 that it is hard to find virgin forest anywhere in the lands they once owned. Some of the roads and railroads they built on the mountains still serve as trails today, and other remnants of their operations are in the nearby woods.|$|E
