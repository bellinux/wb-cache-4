(1) Strict inspecting every segment of <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply <b>chain,</b> and severe punishment on illegal node in <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply <b>chain.</b> This behavior will greatly increase {{the cost of}} illegality of the node, and restrain <b>the</b> occurrence of <b>food</b> safety risk. (2) Weak inspecting every segment of <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply <b>chain,</b> and light punishment on illegal node in <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply <b>chain.</b> This would lose the effect of supervise, and increase the incidence probability of food safety risk.

While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative Tyrannosaurus rex, growing nine to ten meters long and weighing less than possibly 2 metric tons.|$|E
5|$|As an apex predator, Daspletosaurus {{was at the}} top of <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain,</b> {{probably}} {{preying on}} large dinosaurs like the ceratopsid Centrosaurus and the hadrosaur Hypacrosaurus. In some areas, Daspletosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, Gorgosaurus, though there is some evidence of niche differentiation between the two. While Daspletosaurus fossils are rarer than other tyrannosaurids', the available specimens allow some analysis of the biology of these animals, including social behavior, diet and life history.|$|E

5|$|As {{animals at}} the summit of <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain,</b> bears do not have many predators.

The tiger is the only four-legged predator that regularly preys on adult bears, including brown bears, sloth bears, Asiatic black bears, and sun bears.|$|E
5|$|Dioxins from Agent Orange have {{persisted in}} the Vietnamese {{environment}} since the war, settling {{in the soil}} and sediment and entering <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain</b> through animals and fish which feed in the contaminated areas.

5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain,</b> such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain</b> amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E

5|$|In the United States and the European Union, {{since the}} early 1990s {{regulations}} {{have been in place}} that are designed to prevent shellfish from contaminated waters entering <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain.</b> This has meant that there is sometimes a shortage of regulated shellfish, with consequent higher prices. This has led to illegal harvesting and sale of shellfish on the black market, which can be a health hazard.|$|E
5|$|It {{can also}} enter as {{dissolved}} organic carbon through rivers and is converted by photosynthetic organisms into organic carbon. This can either be exchanged throughout <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain</b> or precipitated into the deeper, more carbon-rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells and bones as calcium carbonate. It circulates in this layer {{for long periods of}} time before either being deposited as sediment or being returned to surface waters through thermohaline circulation.|$|E
5|$|It is {{suggested}} that by the Early Cambrian, organisms higher in <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain</b> caused the microbial mats to largely disappear. If these grazers first appeared as the Ediacaran biota started to decline, then it may suggest that they destabilised the microbial substrate, leading to displacement or detachment of the biota; or that {{the destruction of the}} mat destabilised the ecosystem, causing extinctions.|$|E
30|$|The others factors caused {{food safety}} risk and its spread {{including}} the interest game imbalance between all the main participant bodies in <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply <b>chain</b> (Henry and Wernz 2015), the “adverse selection” {{of members of}} <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply <b>chain</b> (Gil et al. 2015; Luning et al. 2015; LeBlanc et al. 2015) and “moral hazard” behavior of members of <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply <b>chain</b> (Malekan and Dionne 2014; Wang and Pallis 2014; Weber 2015; Verrette 2015).

However, the few aforementioned studies deeply investigate the propagation law of food safety risk in <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply <b>chain</b> and its influential factors and mechanism. In fact, the unbalance of supply-demand and membership in <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply <b>chain</b> can significantly affect food safety and its risk spread, and the members behavior.

Fossil evidence indicates a correlation between megalodon and the emergence and diversification of cetaceans and other marine mammals. Juvenile megalodon preferred habitats where small cetaceans were abundant, and adult megalodon preferred habitats where large cetaceans were abundant. Such preferences may have developed shortly after they appeared in the Oligocene.|$|E

This is because the bacteria that are expelled simultaneously with the defecations are adept at breaking down the nutrients in the faeces into a bioavailable form that can be taken up into <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|E

30|$|In this paper, a {{value chain}} {{analysis}} was adopted as the fundamental theoretical framework to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply <b>chain</b> to ships. Value chain analysis {{is a powerful}} tool for managers wanting to identify key activities and design strategic planning within the firm. We use it to discuss competitive strategies and value to the customer in detail. The competitive strategies of firms were evident by their ability to perform better than their competitors on crucial activities along <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply <b>chain.</b> <b>The</b> <b>food</b> supply <b>chains</b> thus maximise value creation while minimising costs (Porter, 1985).|$|R

5|$|Whales {{can also}} be {{threatened}} by humans more indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries as bycatch and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting is a significant cause of mortality in whales and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include beaked whales. Whales are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are high in <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain.</b> They have large reserves of blubber, more so for toothed whales as they are higher up <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain</b> than baleen whales. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. They {{can also be}} poisoned by swallowing litter, such as plastic bags. Environmentalists speculate that advanced naval sonar endangers some whales. Some scientists suggest that sonar may trigger whale beachings, and they point to signs that such whales have experienced decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|A {{food web}} is the archetypal {{ecological}} network. Plants capture solar energy {{and use it}} to synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores, and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal trophic species to a top consumer is called <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain.</b> The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of concept map or a heuristic device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.|$|E

Potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret Allosaurus as having had cooperative social behavior, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. It may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a hatchet.|$|E
