40|$|CVSS {{score is}} widely used as the standard-de-facto risk metric for vulnerabilities, {{to the point that}} the US Government itself {{encourages}} organizations in using it to prioritize vulnerability patching. We tackle this approach by testing the CVSS score in terms of its efficacy as a 2 ̆ 2 risk score 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 prioritization metric. 2 ̆ 2 We test <b>the</b> CVSS against <b>real</b> <b>attack</b> <b>data</b> and as a result, we show that the overall picture is not satisfactory: the (lower-bound) over-investment by using CVSS to choose what vulnerabilities to patch can as high as 300...|$|R

40|$|DoS/DDoS attacks {{constitute}} one of {{the major}} classes of security threats in the Internet today. The attackers usually use IP spoofing to conceal their <b>real</b> location. <b>The</b> current Internet protocols and infrastructure do not provide intrinsic support to traceback <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>attack</b> sources. <b>The</b> objective of IP Traceback is to determine <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>attack</b> sources, as well as the full path taken by the attack packets. Different traceback methods have been proposed, such as IP logging, IP marking and IETF ICMP Traceback (ITrace). In this paper, we propose an enhancement to the ICMP Traceback approach, called ICMP Traceback with Cumulative Path (ITrace-CP). The enhancement consists in encoding the entire attack path information in the ICMP Traceback message. Analytical and simulation studies have been performed to evaluate the performance improvements.

40|$|Abstract: A key {{challenge}} in network forensics arises because of ‘attackers’ {{ability to move}} around in the network, which results in creating a chain of connections; commonly known as connection chains. They are widely used by attackers to stay anonymous and/or to confuse the forensic process. Investigating connection chains can be further complicated when several IP addresses {{are used in the}} attack. In this paper, we highlight this challenging problem. We then propose a solution through hacker profiling. Our solution includes a novel hacker model that integrates information about a hacker’s linguistic, operating system and time of activity. It also includes an algorithm to operate on the proposed model. We establish the effectiveness of the proposed approach through several simulations and an evaluation with a <b>real</b> <b>attack</b> <b>data...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{perform an}} {{analysis}} of SIP, a popular voice over IP (VoIP) protocol and propose a framework for capturing and analysing volatile VoIP data {{in order to determine}} forensic readiness requirements for effectively identifying an attacker. The analysis was performed on <b>real</b> <b>attack</b> <b>data</b> and <b>the</b> findings were encouraging. It seems that if appropriate forensic readiness processes and controls are in place, a wealth of evidence can be obtained. The type of the end user equipment of the internal users, the private IP, the software that is used can help build a reliable baseline information database. On the other hand the private IP addresses of the potential attacker even during the presence of NAT services, as well as and the attack tools employed by the malicious parties are logged for further analysis...|$|R

50|$|In the battle, the Austrians {{suffered}} 2,000 {{killed and}} wounded, plus 1,000 men and 20 cannons captured. The French probably lost between 1,100 and 1,500 men.

50|$|It {{follows from}} the nature of sabre parries (they block an {{incoming}} attack rather than deflecting it as in foil and épée) that they are static and must be taken as late as possible to avoid being duped by a feint attack, committing to a parry in the wrong line and being unable to change parry (which often involves completely altering {{the orientation of the}} blade while moving and rotating the wrist and forearm) to defend against <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>attack</b> quickly enough.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Analysis of {{security}} attacks shows that an attack leaves its imprint or signature {{in the attack}} packets. Traffic from Distributed Denial of Service attacks and rapid worm spreads {{has the potential to}} yield signatures. While all signatures may not be indicative of attacks, it is useful to extract non-transient signatures that are carried by a sufficient number of flows/packets/bytes. The number of packets/bytes in the flows carrying the signature may be used for rate-limiting the flows, providing for timely and automated response to both known and unknown attacks. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm, PISA, which clusters flows based on similarity in packet information and extracts signatures from highbandwidth clusters. Extensive experiments on two weeks of <b>real</b> <b>attack</b> <b>data</b> of 100 million packets yield about 1744 signatures. Additionally, PISA extracted the signature for the Blaster worm connection attempts in a mix of traffic from a trans-Pacific backbone link...|$|R

The British and Danes stubbornly advanced and {{the second and third}} lines of the French infantry gave ground before them. However, Luxembourg was rapidly massing his whole force to crush them. During this time the confusion in the allied main body had reached its height.|$|R
40|$|Online feedback-based {{rating systems}} are gaining popularity. Dealing with {{collaborative}} unfair ratings in such systems {{has been recognized}} as an important but difficult problem. This problem is challenging especially {{when the number of}} honest ratings is relatively small and unfair ratings can contribute to {{a significant portion of the}} overall ratings. In addition, the lack of unfair rating data from real human users is another obstacle toward realistic evaluation of defense mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a set of methods that jointly detect smart and collaborative unfair ratings based on signal modeling. Based on the detection, a framework of trust-assisted rating aggregation system is developed. Furthermore, we design and launch a Rating Challenge to collect unfair rating data from <b>real</b> human users. <b>The</b> proposed system is evaluated through simulations as well as experiments using <b>real</b> <b>attack</b> <b>data.</b> Compared with existing schemes, the proposed system can significantly reduce the impact from collaborative unfair ratings...|$|R
