5|$|Howe {{departed}} in March 1986, and Steve Burtenshaw {{stood in}} {{for two months}} as caretaker. After making a <b>tentative</b> <b>offer</b> to Alex Ferguson, the board settled on appointing George Graham. He led Arsenal to appearances in the League Cup final {{in each of his}} first two seasons, winning in 1987, before losing in 1988. Arsenal's performances in the league also improved and in Graham's third season his team won the league championship in unprecedented fashion, defeating title rivals Liverpool by two clear goals on the final night of the season to be crowned champions on goals scored. He won his second league title in 1990–91, fielding a side that only lost one game throughout the season.|$|E

But a less noble passion worked in him, too; he was inflamed by jealousy. His <b>tentative</b> <b>offer</b> of affection had been rudely and, as he thought, completely repulsed by Cassandra on the preceding day. Denham's confession was in his mind.

Despite the Manchester and Leeds Railway making a counter offer, the directors agreed to take the proposal to Parliament. However, the Manchester and Birmingham was becoming closely associated with the London and Birmingham, and after an energetic intervention by one Dr. Holland, who suggested that the Midland had no real interest in the SA&MR's welfare, the Bill was cancelled.|$|R

5000|$|As the {{proposal}} was debated, Mayor Smith declared a [...] "State of Emergency" [...] on June 14 and forced the police to mobilize to open the ports, {{which led to a}} standoff with the protestors. June 16 all Union Locals, except Los Angeles rejected the <b>tentative</b> <b>offer.</b> After the tentative agreement was rejected by the Longshoremen, the tensions and violence started escalating.Mayor Smith vowed to intervene on June 20 and The Seattle Post Intelligencer headlined [...] "POLICE WILL OPEN PORTS TODAY!". The city and county amassed 300 police, 200 special deputies and 60 State Troopers. Strikers were outraged by Mayor Smith's betrayal of a promise to remain neutral and reinstated the embargo on Alaska Cargo. On July 3 in San Francisco the violence escalated, sparking a riot.|$|E
50|$|The American Basketball Association (ABA) {{was founded}} in 1967 by Dennis Murphy, former mayor of Buena Park, California, and Gary Davidson, an {{attorney}} from Orange County, California. George Mikan, a former National Basketball Association star {{best known for his}} career with the Minneapolis Lakers, was named as the league's first commissioner, saying that the ABA would avoid raiding the players from the NBA as the upstart league as it wanted to avoid legal issues relating to the reserve clause and hoped to avoid creating a bidding war for talent that would make player salaries unaffordable. Despite that, The New York Times reported that <b>tentative</b> <b>offers</b> had been made to Oscar Robertson and Wilt Chamberlain, who was offered a contract that would pay him $50,000 (half of what he was making with the Philadelphia 76ers) along with a 20% share of the team that started play as the New Jersey Americans.|$|R
5|$|With Western Europe neutralised, the OKL and OKW {{turned their}} {{attention}} to Britain, which was now home to the Allied base of operations in Europe. Hitler hoped Britain would negotiate for an armistice, for which he was prepared to offer generous terms. The <b>tentative</b> <b>offers</b> made by Hitler were rejected by the Churchill coalition government. Hitler now ordered the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine to prepare for an amphibious assault of Britain, codenamed Operation Sealion. The Luftwaffe was to eliminate enemy air power and the Kriegsmarine was ordered to make all the necessary preparations for transporting the Heer (Army) across the English Channel. The Luftwaffe's task came first. Once the RAF had been rendered impotent, Göring and Hitler hoped that an invasion would be unnecessary. If this proved not to be the case, the Luftwaffe would then support the army and prevent the Royal Navy interdicting German sea traffic. Göring named the offensive against the RAF as Operation Eagle Attack (Adlerangriff).|$|R

50|$|After Don Giovanni, Mozart {{may have}} had a <b>tentative</b> <b>offer</b> to stay and write another opera for Prague, but he chose to return to Vienna. Maynard Solomon {{suggested}} that the reasons were first that Prague lacked the musical talent available in Vienna. In addition, a career like Mozart's depended on the support of the aristocracy, and Prague was only a provincial capital. There was no patron or musical institution in Prague {{in the late eighteenth century}} capable of offering satisfactory employment to a composer of Mozart's talents. Furthermore, Daniel E. Freeman has pointed out how precarious opera production was in the city throughout the eighteenth century. Indeed, productions of Italian opera in Prague ceased again already in 1789, not to re-appear again until 1791, due to the departure of the impresario Domenico Guardasoni and the death of the impresario Pasquale Bondini.|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} the timeline of events surrounding the commission of Chávez's ballet, one {{from the point of}} view of the Americans, the other from the Mexican side. According to the former view, the commission was formally offered to Chávez in August 1942 , but according to Chávez's biographer Roberto García Morillo, this did not occur until some time in 1943 [...] The difference may have to do with a distinction between a preliminary exploration and a formal offer. A letter from Coolidge to Erick Hawkins dated 10 October 1942 states that Chávez had [...] "accepted my <b>tentative</b> <b>offer</b> but who has, I think, not yet got into touch with Mr Spivacke and Martha", and in November according to Pollack, but not until later in 1943 according to García Morillo, Graham sent Chávez a version of the Daughter of Colchis scenario, only with the New England references removed, expressing fear that he might not like it. On the contrary, Chávez was enthusiastic about the scenario and readily agreed to use it. Copland and Chávez, who had been close friends since the 1920s, were very pleased by the idea of having their ballets premiered together—initially planned for the Berkshire Music Festival, in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, but then rescheduled for Coolidge's birthday, October 30, 1943, at the Library of Congress in Washington ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a player-centric view {{is taken to}} {{illustrate}} game rules in terms of definition and validation. Games with externally-defined but internally-validated rules are given the term contextually-ambiguous games, and {{it is suggested that}} a contemporary definition of pervasiveness in games should accommodate contextual ambiguity. Several pervasive games have displayed elements of this ambiguity, but examples of games which feature this as a core gameplay mechanism are rare. Therefore, four such games are implemented in a case study in order to explore the potential of contextually-ambiguous games. Results are <b>tentative,</b> but <b>offer</b> some insight into potentially popular features and target audiences of such games...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} was undertaken {{to investigate the}} relationship between instruction style and student performance. Instruction style was modelled as a multidimensional approachability construct comprising degrees of immediacy and structure. The capacity for an instructor to manipulate perceived approachability is unequivocally demonstrated. The results also revealed an association between student learning outcomes and instruction style. Performance was positively associated {{with the presence of}} an instructor vis-a-vis no instructor, and also the degree of instructor approachability. Results also confirmed performance to be positively associated with students' ability, negatively associated with students' anxiety, but not associated with gender or several other control factors.
