The results indicated that risk takers were not fully held responsible for their self-inflicted neediness, although they received on average fewer transfers than non-risk-takers. In fact, group favoritism is observed, where non-risk-takers transferred more <b>to</b> <b>loosing</b> non-risk-takers and risk-takers transferred more <b>to</b> <b>loosing</b> risk-takers. This behavioral pattern was stable across different versions of group compounding, profession and gender.
