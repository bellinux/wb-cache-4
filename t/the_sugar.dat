5|$|In 1995, <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> Bowl {{was held}} {{under the rules}} of the Bowl Alliance.

Each year, the two highest-ranked teams would play in a National Championship Game held in place of one of the bowl games.

40|$|We used high-pH anion-exchange {{chromatography}} with pulsed amperometric detection {{to quantify}} the monosaccharides covalently attached to Bacillus thuringiensis HD- 1 (Dipel) crystals. The crystals contained 0. 54 % sugars, including, in decreasing order of prevalence, glucose, fucose, arabinose/rhamnose, galactose, galactosamine, glucosamine, xylose, and mannose. Three lines of evidence indicated that these sugars arose from nonenzymatic glycosylation: (i) <b>the</b> <b>sugars</b> could not be removed by N- or O-glycanases; (ii) <b>the</b> <b>sugars</b> attached were influenced both by the medium in which the bacteria had been grown {{and by the time}} at which the crystals were harvested; and (iii) the chemical identity and stoichiometry of <b>the</b> <b>sugars</b> detected did not fit any known glycoprotein models. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>sugars</b> detected were <b>the</b> product of fermentation conditions rather than bacterial genetics. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of crystal chemistry, fermentation technology, and the efficacy of B. thuringiensis as a microbial insecticide...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sugar</b> may {{be transported}} in bulk {{to the country}} {{where it will be}} used and the {{refining}} process often takes place there. The first stage is known as affination and involves immersing <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular activated carbon or an ion-exchange resin. <b>The</b> <b>sugar</b> syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' molasses.|$|E

5|$|Another {{commodity}} {{that was}} a prominent source of trade was the production of sugar from the crop sugar cane. The original habitat of sugar was in India, where it was taken and planted in various islands. Once reaching {{to the people of}} the Iberian Peninsula, it was further migrated across the Atlantic Ocean. In the 16th century, the first plantations of sugar were started in the New World, marking the last great stage of migration of the cane to the West. Because of the conflict of transporting sugar in its raw form, sugar was not associated with commerce until the act of refining it came into play; this act became the center for industry. Venice was the center for refining during the Middle Ages, therefore making them the chief traders of sugar. Although, the Spanish and Portuguese held the monopolies of <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> cane fields in America, they were being supplied by Venice. In the 17th century, England dominated Venice and became the center for refining and cultivating sugar; this leadership was maintained until the rise of French industry. Sugar throughout the 17th century was still considered a luxury until the latter half of the 17th century when <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> was being produced in mass quantities making it available to the mass of the English people. This turn of events made <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> a commodity, because the crop was not being used in only special occasion, but in all daily meals.|$|E

One of Beamer's assistant coaches, Bud Foster, was named the top defensive coordinator in Division I-A football by American Football Coach Magazine in its annual award.
