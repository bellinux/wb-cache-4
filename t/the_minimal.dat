5|$|During the First World War, Admiral Fisher was {{prevented}} from ordering an improved {{version of the}} preceding s by a wartime restriction that banned construction of ships larger than light cruisers in 1915. To obtain ships suitable for the doctrinal roles of battlecruisers, such as scouting for fleets and hunting enemy raiders, he settled on ships with <b>the</b> <b>minimal</b> armour of a light cruiser and the armament of a battlecruiser. He justified their existence by claiming he needed fast, shallow-draught ships for his Baltic Project, a plan to invade Germany via its Baltic coast.|$|E
5|$|Located {{just east}} of a strong cold front, <b>the</b> <b>minimal</b> {{hurricane}} continued to speed over progressively cooler waters. Shary gradually began to lose its convective symmetry, though the small eye remained distinguishable in microwave images. Within hours, rapid interaction with the front had begun to occur, suggesting the storm was entering an extratropical transition. Data from cyclone phase space diagrams indicated Shary had become post-tropical about 530miles (885km) south-southeast of Cape Race, and the NHC discontinued advisories. Later on that day, the extratropical remnants of Hurricane Shary were completely absorbed by the same neighboring system.|$|E

5|$|The {{cohesive}} forces among liquid molecules {{are responsible}} for the phenomenon of surface tension. In the bulk of the liquid, each molecule is pulled equally in every direction by neighboring liquid molecules, resulting in a net force of zero. The molecules at the surface {{do not have the same}} molecules on all sides of them and therefore are pulled inwards. This creates some internal pressure and forces liquid surfaces to contract to <b>the</b> <b>minimal</b> area.|$|E

25|$|An {{algorithm}} {{is said to}} be constant time (also written as O(1) time) if the value of T(n) is bounded by a value that does not depend {{on the size of the}} input. For example, accessing any single element in an array takes constant time as only one operation has to be performed to locate it. In a similar manner, finding <b>the</b> <b>minimal</b> value in an array sorted in ascending order; it is the first element. However, finding <b>the</b> <b>minimal</b> value in an unordered array is not a constant time operation as scanning over each element in the array is needed in order to determine <b>the</b> <b>minimal</b> value. Hence it is a linear time operation, taking O(n) time. If the number of elements is known in advance and does not change, however, such an algorithm can still be said to run in constant time.|$|E
