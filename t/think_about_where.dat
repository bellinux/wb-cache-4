500|$|The {{metaphor of}} the MCU as [...] "the world's biggest TV show" [...] was {{discussed}} again, {{after the release of}} Captain America: Civil War, by Todd VanDerWerff of Vox, who felt that film in particular highlighted Marvel's success with the model, saying, [...] "Viewed in complete isolation, the plot of Captain America: Civil War makes little to no sense ... when you <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>where</b> [...] has been in earlier Marvel films ... his leeriness about being subject to oversight makes a lot more sense." [...] VanDerWerff continued that when thinking about the MCU as a television series, many [...] "common criticisms people tend to level at it take on a new context" [...] such as complaints that the films are formulaic, lack [...] "visual spark", or [...] "shoehorn in story elements" [...] that [...] "are necessary to set up future films", all characteristics that [...] "are fairly typical on television, where a director's influence is much lower than that of the showrunner", in this case, Feige. Comparing the films to the series Game of Thrones specifically, VanDerWerff noted that each solo film checks [...] "in on various characters and their individual side stories, before bringing everyone together in the finale (or, rather, an Avengers film)", with Guardians of the Galaxy being equivalent to the character Daenerys Targaryen—"both separated by long distances from everybody else." [...] He noted that this format was an extension of early [...] "TV-like" [...] film franchises such as Star Wars, as well as the format of the comics upon which the films are based. [...] "I say all of this not to suggest that film franchises resembling TV series is necessarily a good trend", VanDerWerff concluded, [...] "For as much as I generally enjoy the Marvel movies, I'm disheartened by the possibility that their particular form might take over the film industry ... But I also don't think it's {{the end of the world}} if Marvel continues on ... there's a reason TV has stolen so much of the cultural conversation over the past few decades. There's something legitimately exciting about the way the medium tells stories when it's good, and if nothing else, Marvel's success shows the film world could learn from that." ...|$|E

40|$|To the {{majority}} of America this [Tree-Lined U. S. Highway 101 in Washington State] is very far away indeed. Wood products are taken for granted. No one <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>where</b> they come from. Outside the spotlight, this area suffered as the forests thinned and there were fewer and fewer trees to cut. For years, the balance between preserving the livelihoods of the human inhabitants and protecting the natural integrity of the region was a quiet political contest waged in Washington D.

The station's newsreaders, Anthony Markowitz and Julia Regan (Claudia Christian), give long pieces of opinion after every topic, often using the phrases 'I'm no expert' or 'I don't pretend to know much about this, but...'.

In Tulare County, one of the top Agricultural counties in the country, the agricultural worker is often below the poverty line (Taylor, 2015). They often live in subsidized housing and likely lack access to proper healthcare. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, six out of ten farm workers were here undocumented.

Autophobes will often be in a crowded area or group of people and feel as though they are completely secluded.|$|R

Working closely with the staff at Game Arts, Working Designs implemented design and balance fixes into the American release, including altering the difficulty of some battles that {{were found to be}} [...] "near impossible".

However, they notice that she has gone through considerable changes during her absence, and is more isolated than ever before.

Tess becomes increasingly lonely as time passes, until one night, she is visited by Kevin, now permanently in the form of a phoenix. Her friend made an immense leap of faith as he was swept up in the explosion, allowing him to survive because phoenixes by nature rise from their own ashes when killed. The book ends as Tess prepares to become a phoenix and fly with Kevin over the city.|$|E
