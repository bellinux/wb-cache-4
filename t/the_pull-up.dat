2500|$|Lowe {{improved}} {{his upper body}} strength {{as a result of}} an exercise regimen that included 400 chin-ups and hundreds of dips. [...] In an article for , Gordon Wiltsie, a photographer who climbed with Lowe in Antarctica and Canada's Baffin Island, said, [...] "he'd hog <b>the</b> <b>pull-up</b> bar to knock out 400 pull-ups in sets of 40 and 45. He disliked downtime and knew where to do pull-ups in many airports. Even on expeditions, when rest is hard to come by and much appreciated, Lowe was an oddball. He'd cop pull-ups on a ship's rigging en route to Antarctica, or do dips in a snow pit he dug at base camp." [...] In that article, Wiltsie said, [...] "At Baffin Island, after hauling supplies to a high point on a climb, we went back to camp beat and tired, but Alex proceeded to do pull-up after pull-up. He even brought an exercise device on climbs." [...] He was known jokingly as [...] "Lungs With Legs" [...] for his incredible strength and stamina.|$|E
50|$|Much like <b>the</b> <b>pull-up,</b> {{except that}} the hand {{placement}} is reversed. The hands are facing the person as he pulls his body up using the chin-up bar. Unlike chin-up counterpart <b>the</b> <b>pull-up,</b> the chin-up focuses on the biceps muscles rather than the Latissimus dorsi muscle.|$|E
50|$|The {{width of}} the grip may also differ. When {{grabbing}} and holding the bar during <b>the</b> <b>pull-up,</b> the hands can be apart at shoulder-width, or wider, or narrower enough to touch each other. This may make <b>the</b> <b>pull-up</b> more difficult and may limit the range of motion compared to the shoulder-width grip.|$|E
30|$|For convenience, {{we define}} <b>the</b> exo-atmospheric <b>pull-up</b> {{maneuver}} problem (P_A^exo) as (P_A) without state constraints and without aerodynamic forces and <b>the</b> unconstrained <b>pull-up</b> maneuver problem (P_A^unc) as (P_A) without state constraints.|$|R

50|$|The main use for Pull-Ups Training Pants is {{as an aid}} for toilet {{training}} toddlers and to {{help them}} learn not to wet. Although up until 2000 Pull-Ups Training Pants were nothing more than diapers that go off and on like underwear, since 2000, there have been several changes to them. The first one was the addition of magic stars/flowers (now known as Learning Designs on March 2nd, 2005) on the inside only in 2005 and front of the pant that fade when the wearer wets it as a way of discouraging wetting, and as a motivation to stay dry in time {{to make it to the}} potty, and if the wearer stays dry, the stars/flowers will stay on <b>the</b> <b>Pull-Up.</b> Next was the addition of Easy-Open sides. These made it so that the sides of <b>the</b> <b>Pull-Up</b> still go off and on like underwear, but enable parents to easily open <b>the</b> <b>Pull-Up</b> to check to see if the wearer soiled <b>the</b> <b>Pull-Up,</b> or to quickly change a messy Pull-Up. However many enjoy this feature, some parents have criticized this feature for causing <b>the</b> <b>Pull-Up</b> to rip too easily.|$|E
50|$|The {{pulldown}} {{is extremely}} similar to <b>the</b> <b>pull-up,</b> but uses moving external weights or resistance with a fixed body {{rather than a}} fixed bar and a moving body. This makes the pull-down an open-chain movement and <b>the</b> <b>pull-up</b> a closed-chain movement. The weight moved can also be adjusted to {{be more or less}} than the weight of the person doing the exercise.|$|E

5000|$|PORTx: Output port register. Sets {{the output}} value on pins {{configured}} as outputs. Enables or disables <b>the</b> <b>pull-up</b> resistor on pins configured as inputs.|$|E
50|$|A pull-up {{resistor}} pulls the voltage {{of the signal}} it is connected to towards its voltage source level. When the other components associated with the signal are inactive, the voltage supplied by the pull up prevails and brings the signal up to a logical high level. When another component on the line goes active, it overrides <b>the</b> <b>pull-up</b> resistor. <b>The</b> <b>pull-up</b> resistor ensures that the wire is at a defined logic level even if no active devices are connected to it.|$|E
5000|$|Fast mode plus {{achieves}} up to 1 Mbit/s {{using more}} powerful (20 mA) drivers and pull-ups to achieve faster {{rise and fall}} times. Compatibility with standard and fast mode devices (with 3 mA pull-down capability) can be achieved {{if there is some}} way to reduce the strength of <b>the</b> <b>pull-ups</b> when talking to them.|$|R

500|$|A workout {{named in}} Michael's honor is often {{performed}} at CrossFit affiliates across the United States on Memorial Day. The workout is named [...] "Murph" [...] {{and consists of}} a 1 mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 air squats, and a final 1 mile run. <b>The</b> <b>pull-ups,</b> push-ups, and air squats can be partitioned and scaled as needed.|$|R
50|$|Until 2017, male {{marines were}} {{required}} to perform pull-ups, and female Marines performed the flexed hang instead of <b>the</b> <b>pull-up.</b> The flexed hang was started with the chin above <b>the</b> <b>pull-up</b> bar. The timer was started and did not stop until the arms became fully extended. The feet could not touch the ground or any part of <b>the</b> <b>pull-up</b> bar at any time. The Marine Corps had originally indicated that, as of January 1, 2014, female Marines {{would be required to}} perform a minimum of three pull-ups in order to pass the PFT. However, when more than half of female recruits were unable to meet this standard, the change was delayed. In 2017, the flexed-arm hang event was be eliminated, and both male and female marines were given the choice to do either push-ups or pull-ups for this event.|$|E
5000|$|The pull-ups may be {{done with}} either an {{overhand}} (pronated) grip or an underhand (supinated) [...] "chin-up" [...] grip. Changes in grip are allowed {{as long as the}} feet don't touch the ground and only the hands come in contact with <b>the</b> <b>pull-up</b> bar. <b>The</b> <b>pull-up</b> begins at the [...] "dead-hang" [...] with arms extended and the body hanging motionless. A successful pull-up is performed without excess motion, the body rising until the chin is above the bar, and body lowered back to the [...] "dead-hang" [...] position. There is no time limit.|$|E
50|$|In all cases, the {{aircraft}} performing <b>the</b> <b>pull-up,</b> split off, or {{missing from the}} formation, is honoring the person (or persons) who has died, and it represents their departure.|$|E
50|$|Some {{disadvantages}} of <b>pull-up</b> resistors are <b>the</b> extra power consumed when current is drawn through the resistor and the reduced {{speed of a}} pull-up compared to an active current source. Certain logic families are susceptible to power supply transients introduced into logic inputs through pull-up resistors, which may force {{the use of a}} separate filtered power source for <b>the</b> <b>pull-ups.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time that Wetness Liner was renamed Cool Alert, Pull-Ups {{introduced}} Night Time <b>Pull-Ups.</b> <b>The</b> Night Time <b>Pull-Ups</b> were very much like a regular Pull-Ups pant, except it has more absorbency, and they have bedtime designs featuring Disney's Princess Rapunzel and Doc McStuffins characters for girls and Cars and Jake and the Never Land Pirates characters for boys. <b>The</b> Night Time <b>Pull-Ups</b> are not available in the 4T-5T size.|$|R
5000|$|Armstrong {{contributed a}} well-respected {{exercise}} regimen {{known as the}} [...] "Armstrong Pullup Program" [...] which he used to get his trainees into shape for passing the USMC PFT and to get himself ready for attempts on <b>the</b> <b>pull-ups</b> completed in a single session world record. His seven-day regimen has varied tasks for five days with two consecutive rest days. Many officer training organizations keep the text of his program on hand and available online.|$|R

50|$|Wetness Liner Pull-Ups Training Pants {{were first}} {{distributed}} in 2005 as a competitor to the now defunct Pampers Feel 'N Learn. These Pull-Ups were much like Learning Designs Pull-Ups, except they added special liner to the Wetness Liner ones. This liner {{is placed on}} the inside of <b>the</b> <b>Pull-up,</b> where the wearer is most likely to wet, and is sensitive to urine. When the Wetness Liner is exposed to urine, it causes the wearer to feel uncomfortable, and learn that (s)he should not wet oneself and use the toilet instead. Wetness Liner Pull-Ups also have the Learning Designs, which also fade when the wearer wets <b>the</b> <b>pull-up.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 2000, Huggies {{introduced}} and started integrating their new [...] "Learning Designs" [...] feature into all Huggies Pull-Ups training pants. These were small designs on <b>the</b> <b>Pull-Up</b> that use a special ink that fades {{when exposed to}} wetness, with an intent to let the wearer know when the wearer is wet or dry and as an incentive for urinating in the toilet instead of in <b>the</b> <b>Pull-Up.</b> But on March 2nd, 2005, the original Huggies Pull-Ups are now known as Learning Designs. Learning Designs Pull-Ups also have a small star picture on the inside that is digested on, that is also printed on certain ink that evaporates when exposed to feces.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A new CMOS buffer without {{short-circuit}} {{power consumption}} is proposed. In this work, the gate-driving signal of <b>the</b> output <b>pull-up</b> (pull-down) transistor is fed back to <b>the</b> output pull-down (<b>pull-up)</b> transistor to get tri-state output momentarily, eliminating the short-circuit power consumption. The TSPICE simulations {{are used to}} verify {{the operation of the}} buffer. It is observed that the power-delay product of the proposed buffer is about 15 % smaller than conventional tapered CMOS buffer...|$|R
5000|$|Pull-ups, when one's grip is {{wide with}} the palms {{facing away from}} the user, are also common. One {{attempts}} to pull himself up and touch his chest to <b>the</b> <b>pull-up</b> bar. Pull-ups strongly involve the latissimus dorsi muscle.|$|E
50|$|A back lever is {{a static}} hold {{performed}} on the rings or <b>the</b> <b>pull-up</b> bar. A back lever is rated as an 'A' value skill on the Code of Points, a scale from A to F, with F being the most difficult.|$|E
