500|$|Following pleas from Brown {{to resurrect}} Nick, John Altman {{returned}} to the serial again in December 2008, in a storyline that saw Nick attempt to con Dot again, this time aided by a previously unheard of daughter, Dotty (Molly Conlin). [...] Altman explained: [...] "Nick needed something, because I think if he didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk <b>through</b> <b>that</b> <b>door,</b> she would just have treated him as a complete outcast." [...] As the storyline progressed, {{it was revealed that}} Nick and Dotty had intentions to kill Dot for her inheritance; they concocted a plan to make her think she had developed dementia then overdose her with sleeping pills, which fails when Dotty has a change of heart and Nick flees once again after causing an explosion and being disowned by Dot.|$|E
500|$|The Byrds {{included}} {{a recording of}} [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] on their 1965 debut album, Mr. Tambourine Man. The song was the last track to be recorded for the album but the session was marred by conflict and drama. After the band had completed the song's instrumental backing track, guitarist and harmony vocalist David Crosby announced that he wasn't going to sing on the recording and was instead leaving the studio for the day. The precise reason for Crosby's refusal to sing the song has never been adequately explained but the ensuing fracas between the guitarist and the band's manager, record producer Jim Dickson, ended with Dickson sitting on Crosby's chest, telling him [...] "The only way you're going to get <b>through</b> <b>that</b> <b>door</b> is over my dead body...You're {{going to stay in}} this room until you do the vocal." [...] According to a number of people present in the studio that day, Crosby burst into tears but eventually completed the song's harmony part with sterling results. Dickson himself noted in later years that his altercation with Crosby was a cathartic moment in which the singer [...] "got it all out and sang like an angel." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{at least}} one occasion, the gag is flipped, and the closet is silent: in [...] "Man's Untapped Energies" [...] (broadcast March 11, 1947), visiting Dr. Gamble makes to leave. Molly warns, [...] "No, Doctor, not <b>through</b> <b>that</b> <b>door,</b> that's the hall closet!" [...] As the {{audience}} chuckles slightly in anticipation, Fibber explains: [...] "Oh, I forgot to tell you, Molly, I straightened out the hall closet this morning!" [...] This was certainly {{not the end of}} the gag, though, as the closet soon became cluttered once again, leading to many more disasters.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{watching}} {{a man who has}} been sitting at a small table over there," [...] he remarked. [...] "He has just gone out <b>through</b> <b>that</b> inner <b>door.</b> For a moment I could have sworn that it was Carl Freudenberg." ...|$|R
60|$|And Michael did so think. As {{a matter}} of course, <b>through</b> <b>that</b> open <b>door,</b> he was {{prepared}} to have the South-Pacific Ocean flow in, bearing on its bosom schooners and ships, islands and reefs, and all men and animals and things he once had known and still remembered.|$|R

2500|$|None of the show's running gags was as memorable or {{enduring}} as The Closet (so popular, in fact, that PBS's Zoboomafoo {{kept the}} joke alive). The gag involved McGee's frequently opening and cacophonous closet, with the bric-a-brac it contained clattering {{down and out}} and, often enough, over McGee's or Molly's heads. [...] "I gotta get that closet cleaned out one of these days" [...] was the usual McGee observation once the racket subsided. Naturally, [...] "one of these days" [...] almost never arrived. A good thing, too: in one famous instance, when a burglar (played by Bob Bruce) tied up McGee, McGee informed him cannily that the family's silver was [...] "right <b>through</b> <b>that</b> <b>door,</b> bud... just yank it open, bud!" [...] Naturally, the burglar took the bait and naturally, he {{was buried in the}} inevitable avalanche, long enough for the police to apprehend him.|$|E
2500|$|On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova {{was awakened}} by four NKVD agents {{pounding}} upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, [...] "Someday we'll see each other..." [...] And without looking back, {{he got out of the}} car and went <b>through</b> <b>that</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On 2 October 2008 it was {{reported}} that Nick would return to EastEnders on Christmas Day that year after more than seven years away. Executive producer Diederick Santer spoke of his excitement at Nick's return, hailing the character as an [...] "EastEnders legend" [...] and [...] "one of the show's best-remembered and best-loved villains". Altman stated: [...] "After an absence of seven years, I am thrilled to return to Albert Square. The BBC have always given me great storylines as Nick Cotton and I look forward to seeing if Nick will once again spread fear and loathing throughout the Square!" [...] June Brown revealed that she had been asking producers to bring Altman back to the soap for 6 or 7 years, as the two of them share such a good working relationship. After spending time in Walsall, Cotton returns; walking normally again, and he is accompanied by his seven-year-old daughter, Dotty. He explained that he had met Dotty's mother Sandy while living in a squat, and that she was an alcoholic who had recently died, leaving him with custody of Dotty. Altman explained: [...] "Nick needed something, because I think if he didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk <b>through</b> <b>that</b> <b>door,</b> she would just have treated him as a complete outcast." [...] The actor described other changes to his character since his last appearance, detailing how he had become a plumber, begun dressing more smartly, stopped gelling his hair back and no longer wore an earring.|$|E
60|$|As {{the youth}} passed <b>through</b> the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> {{led to the}} room beyond, Gian Maria caught {{for a moment the}} accents of an {{exquisite}} male voice singing a love-song to the accompaniment of a lute.|$|R
5000|$|The sets seen in {{this episode}} are {{markedly}} different from those used later in the show's run. For instance, the Solomons' loft apartment doesn't have a staircase and the room is instead entered <b>through</b> the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> would later lead to Dick's bedroom. In Dick and Mary's office, Dick has the desk that would later become Mary's and vice versa. Also, most of the set dressing in the office is different and it is entered <b>through</b> the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> later leads to Nina's office. The sets were altered in [...] "Truth or Dick", the next episode to be filmed, and they remained largely unchanged {{for the remainder of}} the show's run.|$|R
500|$|Marge's line, [...] "Dear God, this is Marge Simpson. If You {{stop this}} {{hurricane}} and save our family, {{we will be}} forever grateful and recommend You to all our friends", was cited by journalist Mark Pinsky {{as an example of}} how [...] "Simpson family members are both defined and circumscribed by religion." [...] Journalist Ben Rayner speculated that some fans, whom he called [...] "nerds", would want an explanation of [...] "how Barney fit <b>through</b> <b>that</b> tiny <b>door</b> to the 'master bedroom' in the rebuilt Flanders family home." ...|$|R

60|$|We {{passed through}} Alfred Inglethorp's room, and Poirot delayed {{long enough to}} make a brief but fairly {{comprehensive}} examination of it. We went out <b>through</b> <b>that</b> <b>door,</b> locking both it and that of Mrs. Inglethorp's room as before.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I ask you--ask you, please to go away,' Frau Ebermann pleaded. 'Go to my Anna <b>through</b> <b>that</b> <b>door,</b> and {{she will}} give you cakes and sweeties. It is not kind {{of you to come}} into my room and behave so badly.' ...|$|E
60|$|We {{found the}} court lighted with torches, the Coadjutor's {{chaplain}} arranging his purple robe, {{as he walked}} on <b>through</b> the <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> were opened for him. Sir Francis led Madame Darpent, Clement gave me his had, as we followed closely and noiselessly.|$|R
6000|$|Common-sense {{argument}} {{would not}} have prevailed with Mrs. Muldoon. The Professor felt that; added {{to which he had}} not any handy.

6000|$|... "Mistress Westmacott is leaving," [...] he {{informed}} his servant, and bowed low and formally in farewell before her. She passed out without another word, the old butler following, and presently <b>through</b> the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> remained open came Trenchard, in quest of Mr. Wilding who stood bemused.|$|R
60|$|I {{seem to see}} {{the figure}} of that little boy, drawn and repelled. And {{it was very clear}} in his mind, too, though why it should be so was never explained, that his father would be very angry if he went in <b>through</b> <b>that</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Less than {{a minute}} ago," [...] Tavernake told him, [...] "I was walking here with a friend. A man came up behind us and tried {{deliberately}} to stab him. He bolted afterwards <b>through</b> <b>that</b> <b>door,</b> my friend followed him, the door was closed in my face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a most}} curious thing," [...] he went on, [...] "and I suppose I must be {{suffering}} from hallucinations, but I could swear that just now I saw looking <b>through</b> <b>that</b> <b>door</b> the same improper young woman clothed in a few flowers and nothing else, whose photograph in that abominable and libellous book was indirectly the cause of our tempestuous voyage." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bab Alioua, {{literally}} meaning [...] "Gate of the Little Storey", {{built by}} the sultan hafside Abū lshâq Ibrâhîm al-Mustansir (1349-1369) at {{the eastern edge of}} the ramparts, owes its name to the first floor that overcame it. It was <b>through</b> this <b>door</b> <b>that</b> Hayreddin Barbarossa entered Tunis in 1534.|$|R
6000|$|Carefully I {{recalled}} every circumstance of my {{pursuit of}} Thurid, and my conclusion was identical with my original belief--that Thurid had {{come this way}} without other assistance than his own knowledge and passed <b>through</b> the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> barred my progress, unaided from within. But how had he accomplished it? ...|$|R
60|$|As I tore {{across the}} lawn, {{regardless}} of the bed of flowers which was Mrs. Canby's pride, Kate's cry was repeated, this time in a more intense tone.

6000|$|CHARTERIS (smiling subtly). Now you {{are getting}} unreasonable. Do come along without any more nonsense. At any rate, I am going. I am {{not strong enough to}} carry you home; but I am strong enough to make my way <b>through</b> <b>that</b> <b>door</b> in spite of you. You will then have a new {{grievance}} against me for my brutal violence. (He takes a step towards the door.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Harkee, Mr. Peddler," [...] {{said the}} refugee, {{in a voice}} that would not be denied, [...] "I want not your company. <b>Through</b> <b>that</b> <b>door</b> lies your road--march! offer to touch that dog, and you'll swing in his place, though twenty Sir Henrys wanted your services." [...] So saying, he retired to the road with the sergeant, as the peddler precipitately retreated down the bank.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Who {{wants to}} hold it? I don't. What {{does it matter}} if they do get me? I don't care. I've a good mind to walk {{straight}} out <b>through</b> <b>that</b> <b>door</b> and let them rope me in. It would serve Dad right. It would teach him not to send me away from home to any darned school again. What did he want to do it for? I was all right where I was. I--' ...|$|E
60|$|Bottles {{waited to}} see no more. With set teeth and flaming eyes he crept, a broken man, <b>through</b> the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> led on to the landing, crept {{down the stairs and}} into the hall. On the pegs were his hat and coat; he took them and passed into the street.|$|R
50|$|Occasionally, {{there are}} other effects from that chant, such as Lydia's room {{changing}} to a gothic castle. On a few occasions, other people and ghosts went to the Neitherworld or the living world, either when Lydia takes them with her by chanting Beetlejuice's name, or presumably <b>through</b> a <b>door</b> <b>that</b> connects Lydia's and Beetlejuice's homes.|$|R
60|$|It {{was upon}} this scene that a hatless, dust-covered {{man in a}} red hunting coat burst <b>through</b> the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> had {{admitted}} Maenck.

60|$|They {{all agreed}} that this was well, and soon after fell into groups, and {{dispersed}} about the rooms. When everybody's attention was thus occupied Lord Mountclere whispered to Ethelberta tremulously, 'Don't tell more: you think too much of them: they are no better than you! Will you meet me in the little winter garden two minutes hence? Pass <b>through</b> <b>that</b> <b>door,</b> and along the glass passage.' He himself left the room by an opposite door.|$|E
6000|$|... "There was a room {{above the}} bed chamber," [...] said the guide, [...] "as we see by {{the windows and}} the fireplace, {{but there was no}} {{stairway}} to it from Queen Mary's apartments. The only access to it was <b>through</b> <b>that</b> <b>door,</b> which leads in {{from the top of the}} rampart wall. And there is another room below, and partly under ground. That is the room where Walter Scott represents the false keys to have been forged." ...|$|E
6000|$|But of Armand {{there was}} no sign, and she--poor soul!--had {{difficulty}} in not betraying the anxiety which she felt for her brother. Had the flagstones swallowed him up? A door on the right {{was the only one}} that gave on the corridor at this point; it led to the concierge's lodge, and thence out into the courtyard. Had Chauvelin been dreaming, sleeping with his eyes open, whilst he stood waiting for her, and had Armand succeeded in slipping past him under cover of the darkness and <b>through</b> <b>that</b> <b>door</b> to safety that lay beyond these prison walls? ...|$|E
25|$|On Sunday, September 18th, the Kauffman Center held a free {{open house}} for the public, and an {{estimated}} 55,000 people came <b>through</b> the <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> day.

50|$|In 914 the Umayyads {{built an}} alcazaba with a quadrangular wall {{attached}} to the old Roman wall of the city.

This entrance consisted of an arch that preserves the north jamb.|$|R
