5|$|On 1 December, {{injured by}} bomb wounds <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> head, Cherry was {{evacuated}} to Egypt, {{where he was}} commissioned as a second lieutenant on 9 December. Three days later, the 26th Battalion was withdrawn from Gallipoli and evacuated to Egypt where Cherry rejoined them in preparation for service on the Western Front. Remaining in Egypt during this time, Cherry was selected {{to attend a machine}} gun course in March 1916. After completion of this, he was transferred to the 7th Machine Gun Company in France.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June 1917, Peeler {{participated in}} the initial assault on Messines Ridge. Manning a Lewis Gun during the action, he was injured twice, {{suffering}} shrapnel wounds <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> eye from an artillery shell, and a gunshot wound to his right cheek. He spent three days in hospital before returning to his battalion. On 22 June, he was once again promoted to lance corporal. The 3rd Pioneer Battalion spent the next four months in a quieter section of the front.|$|E
5|$|San Martín's {{horse was}} {{killed during the}} battle, and his leg was trapped under the corpse of the animal after the fall. A royalist, {{probably}} Zabala himself, attempted to kill San Martín while he was trapped under his dead horse where he suffered a saber injury <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> a bullet wound to his arm. Juan Bautista Cabral and Juan Bautista Baigorria of San Martín's regiment intervened and saved his life; Cabral was mortally wounded, and died shortly afterwards.|$|E

5|$|The Sultan {{responded to}} the ban by putting {{pressure}} on the state authorities to enforce isolation of the Johor hockey teams from all national tournaments. In November 1992, Douglas Gomez, a coach for the Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar field hockey team, expressed his displeasure of being called to withdraw from a semi-final national hockey match by the Director of the Johor Education Department. The incident {{attracted the attention of}} the Sultan, who personally summoned Gomez to his palace, Istana Bukit Serene, where he was promptly reprimanded and assaulted by the Sultan. Following Gomez's meeting with the Sultan, Gomez sought treatment <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> stomach. Subsequently, he lodged a police report against the Sultan for assault. Gomez elaborated that the Sultan bodyguards, members of the Johor Military Force personnel, were merely onlookers, and that the Sultan was solely responsible for the injuries.|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 1940, on his 133rd combat {{mission of}} the war, {{engaging}} in aerial combat for the 32nd time, Mölders was shot down near Compiègne at about 18:40 by Sous lieutenant René Pomier Layrargues, flying a French Air Force Dewoitine D.520. Mölders was taken prisoner but liberated three weeks later upon the armistice with France. While in French captivity, Mölders asked {{to shake hands with}} the pilot who had shot him down, and learned that Pomier-Layrargues had been killed in action 30 minutes after their encounter. His initial experience in French captivity was harsh; he sustained abrasions <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> his Knight's Cross was stolen from him. A French officer, Capitaine Giron, intervened, ensured he was treated fairly, and returned the stolen medal. When a French soldier was later sentenced to death by the Germans for beating Mölders, Mölders approached Hermann Göring and requested clemency, which was granted.|$|E
25|$|After a {{traditional}} Irish wake, with a closed coffin necessitated {{due to the}} damage <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> a funeral service at St. Catherine's Church in Newry, Collins' body was buried at the town's Monkshill Cemetery, {{not far from the}} grave of Albert White, a Catholic former Royal Ulster Constabulary Inspector, whose assassination he helped to organize in 1982.|$|E
50|$|The suspect, David Frank Jennings, 30, {{a heavily}} tattooed white supremacist, {{attacked}} Krugel from behind {{with a piece}} of concrete hidden in a bag while Krugel was using an exercise machine, delivering multiple blows <b>to</b> <b>his</b> skull, <b>face</b> <b>and</b> neck. Krugel suffered multiple skull fractures, internal bleeding and multiple lacerations <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head, <b>face</b> <b>and</b> brain. The beating knocked out teeth and also fractured one of his eye sockets. Krugel was pronounced dead at the scene.|$|R

25|$|Having {{thoroughly}} {{checked the}} surrounding area, the officer in command, Captain D.H. Galatti, began cutting down {{the body of}} Clifford Martin using a knife fastened to a pole. When it fell, the mine went off, blowing Martin's body to pieces and knocking sideways the tree from which Paice's body was hung. Despite jumping back, the captain received wounds <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> a shoulder.|$|E
25|$|Umarov {{began his}} {{participation}} in the Second Chechen War in September 1999, as a field commander, again cooperating closely with Ruslan Gelayev during the Russian siege for Grozny. In early 2000, Umarov sustained a serious wound <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> jaw {{as he was leaving}} the surrounded Grozny, and was hospitalized in a neutral country, probably Georgia (or possibly in southern Russia in a secret cooperation with elements within Russian secret services, as it was alleged by Novaya Gazeta journalist and former Russian military officer Vyacheslav Izmailov), alongside the also injured and evacuated Zakayev. After his convalescence (including undergoing extensive plastic surgery), Umarov raised and led a militia force in Georgia's remote Pankisi Gorge before his return to Chechnya in the summer of 2002.|$|E
25|$|The first {{murder for}} which Bonin was charged {{was that of}} a 13-year-old {{hitchhiker}} named Thomas Glen Lundgren. Lundgren was last seen leaving his parents' house in Reseda at 10:50a.m. on the morning of May 28, 1979: his body, clad only in a T-shirt, shoes and socks, was found the same afternoon in Agoura. An autopsy revealed that Lundgren had suffered emasculation and bludgeoning <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> head, with his skull sustaining multiple fractures. In addition, the youth had been slashed across the throat, extensively stabbed, and strangled to death. His underwear, jeans, and severed genitals were discovered strewn in a field close to his body. In the abduction and murder of Lundgren, Bonin was assisted by Vernon Butts, who is suspected of accompanying or assisting Bonin on at least eight further murders attributed to the Freeway Killer.|$|E

500|$|A {{second group}} {{surrounded}} PC Coombes, who sustained a five-inch-long cut <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> broken {{upper and lower}} jaws. In 2004 {{he said he was}} still suffering the effects of the attack, which the police regard as attempted murder, including poor hearing and eyesight, epileptic fits, and a memory so poor that he was left unable to read a book or drive. A third constable, Michael Shepherd, had his protective helmet pierced by an iron spike. Several of the officers and firemen turned and ran back toward the crowd to try to save Blakelock and Coombes. Trevor Stratford told a reporter in 2010: [...] "I remember running in with another fire officer to get Dick Coombes. I literally slid into the group, like a rugby player charging into a ruck. We dragged him out, but he was in a hell of a state": ...|$|E
500|$|A Cajun mutant thief who has {{the ability}} to convert the {{potential}} energy of any object he touches into kinetic energy, forcing it to explode. The size of the object determines the magnitude of the resulting explosion. He is also skilled in the use of a staff, and happens to be very agile. Due to the nature of his power, he displays supernatural durability, being able to take Wolverine's elbow <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> return to fight moments later. When asked about his thoughts on the character, Kitsch had said, [...] "I knew of him, but I didn't know the following he had. I'm sure I'm still going to be exposed to that. I love the character, I love the powers, and I love what they did with him. I didn't know that much, but in my experience, it was a blessing to go in and create my take on him. I'm excited for it, to say the least." ...|$|E
500|$|From July 1940, still {{flying with}} No. 17 Squadron, Harper {{was one of}} [...] "The Few", the Allied pilots of the Battle of Britain. On 11 August he shared in the {{probable}} destruction of a Bf 110 and damaged a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter. Four days later, after taking off {{as part of a}} group of six Hawker Hurricanes assigned to intercept more than 20 Luftwaffe aircraft, Harper contacted the German planes alone and probably destroyed a Bf 109 before being shot down. He crash-landed in a field near the Suffolk seaside town of Felixstowe, and convalesced in hospital there with wounds <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> leg. He soon rejoined No. 17 Squadron and continued his command of A Flight from the ground—he returned to the skies on 1 November 1940. A week later he destroyed a Ju 87 and probably another. Harper received the war substantive rank of flight lieutenant on 12 February 1941. A month later he was posted to No. 57 Operational Training Unit RAF, based at RAF Hawarden in Wales, as an instructor.|$|E
60|$|Anson {{turned away}} {{and went into the}} kitchen <b>to</b> wash <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> comb <b>his</b> hair, glad <b>to</b> get rid of the sight of Kendall for a moment. Mrs. Stickney was {{toasting}} some bread.|$|R
60|$|He {{went out}} into the morning exultantly, and ran down to the river <b>to</b> bathe <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> hands, allured by its splendid voice. The world seemed very bright and {{beautiful}} and health-giving once more.|$|R

500|$|On 8 November 2007 two RIRA members shot an off-duty PSNI officer {{as he sat}} in his car on Bishop Street in Derry, causing {{injuries}} <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> arm. On 12 November another PSNI {{member was}} shot by RIRA members in Dungannon, County Tyrone. On 7 February 2008, the RIRA stated that, after experiencing a three-year period of reorganisation, it intended to [...] "go back to war" [...] by launching a new offensive against [...] "legitimate targets". It also, despite having apologised for the Omagh bombing, denied any large scale involvement with the attack and said that their part had only gone as far as their codeword being used. On 12 May 2008 the RIRA seriously injured a member of the PSNI when a booby trap bomb exploded underneath his car near Spamount, County Tyrone. On 25 September 2008 the RIRA shot a man in the neck in St Johnston, near the Derry border. The same man was targeted in a pipe bomb attack on his home on 25 October, the RIRA did not claim responsibility for the attack, but security forces believe they were responsible for it.|$|E
500|$|Despite the victory, the {{remaining}} royalist forces {{could not be}} pursued as the column led by Justo Bermúdez had moved further than calculated for. This delayed the meeting with San Martín's column whose horse was killed by enemy fire, leaving with his leg trapped under the corpse of the animal. These factors led to the columns not meeting up and allowed many royalists to escape. A royalist, probably Zabala himself, attempted to kill San Martín while he was trapped under his dead horse where he suffered a saber injury <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> a bullet wound to his arm. Juan Bautista Cabral and Juan Bautista Baigorria intervened and saved San Martín's life. Cabral was mortally wounded during the rescue and San Martín reported that after Cabral was hit he said [...] "I die happy, we have defeated the enemy". The exact moment this was said is unclear as the word [...] "after" [...] could have meant immediately after; during the ongoing battle; or some hours later during Cabral's agonising decline. San Martín wrote the battle report under a nearby tree. Fray Herminio Gaitán considers that Cabral's last words {{would have been in}} the Guaraní language, his first language, and that as San Martín also spoke Guaraní he would have translated them for the battle report.|$|E
500|$|At the Regimental Aid Post, Waddy {{found that}} the doctors did not rate his chances {{particularly}} highly; the 156 Battalion's war diary even recorded that [...] "B Company commander was fatally wounded". He was taken next to a Field Ambulance post {{and from there to}} the Tafelburg hotel in Oosterbeek, now being used as a Main Dressing Station. [...] Here he was operated on in the hotel's billiard room where Major Guy Rigby Jones used the billiard table to perform surgery. [...] A day later he was moved to a house opposite as the number of casualties increased. Because the aid stations were in {{the front lines of the}} Oosterbeek perimeter, they came under constant fire and he was wounded twice more. A mortar round shell fragment lodged in his left foot, and a later hit caused splinter injuries <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> shoulder. [...] On another occasion, as the battle seesawed around the aid post, Germans occupied his building. A British sniper shot a German rifleman, prompting a German sergeant to lecture the British about shooting at a Red Cross house. [...] When the house caught fire he was taken outside and driven to a collection point from where German medics took him to Apeldoorn.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was then}} that the elder Giant, who had a flowing gray beard, raised <b>his</b> {{thoughtful}} eyes <b>to</b> <b>his</b> companion's <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> in a grave and solemn voice addressed him thus: ...|$|R

60|$|The {{attendant}} did not understand, but smiled blandly <b>and</b> continued <b>to</b> bathe <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> also <b>his</b> head. Soon {{the full}} realization {{of what had}} happened came to the young gunner's mate. Then he asked about Luke.|$|R
500|$|Henry Johnson survives, however, {{under the}} watchful eye of Dr. Trescott, who treats the injured man out of {{gratitude}} for saving his son's life. [...] Hagenthorpe, a leading figure in town, urges Trescott to let Henry die, stating that he [...] "will hereafter be a monster, a perfect monster, and probably with an affected brain. No man can observe you as I have observed you and not know that it was a matter of conscience with you, but I am afraid, my friend, that it is one of the blunders of virtue." [...] Ultimately Trescott decides to move Henry, who has sustained disfiguring injuries <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> psyche, to a local negro household, but Henry's presence proves troubling for the family's well-being, and he is moved to another. [...] One night Henry absconds, visiting various people around town and leaving terrified neighbors in his wake, including Bella Farragut, who he attempts to court as if no time has passed since they last met. [...] Not welcome anywhere else, Henry is eventually moved to the carriage-house in the newly built Trescott home. [...] Despite Dr. Trescott's protection, Henry is branded a monster by the townspeople, who avoid the Trescotts as a result. [...] Although previously Henry's friend, Jimmie now mocks him, daring his friends to approach the disfigured man. [...] Once the leading doctor in Whilomville, Trescott's reputation suffers greatly, as does that of his wife, who no longer receives visitors.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} The Office website {{included three}} cut scenes from [...] "Golden Ticket". One 72-second clip includes Michael eavesdropping from the men's bathroom on Angela, Oscar, Kelly and Meredith, who discuss how unfair Michael is treating Dwight in making him take the fall over the failed golden ticket promotion. Kelly {{also makes the}} remark, [...] "I hope Dwight gets fired and they get a hot new guy to replace him," [...] to which Oscar replies, [...] "Seriously." [...] In another 52-second scene, Michael asks Dwight {{to go on a}} stroll, but Dwight suggests turning it into a [...] "power stroll", which he prepares Michael for by applying sunscreen <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>And</b> in a follow-up to the scene where workers discuss that Michael should be fired, a visibly angry and upset Michael confronts the office. When he says [...] "Can any of you imagine this office without me?" [...] everyone gleefully raises their hands, but Michael then asks them if they've thought about what kind of terrible person they could get to replace him; he then pointedly says that they could get someone who knows they don't actually need three accountants (Oscar, Kevin, and Angela look visibly ashamed that Michael knew this going back to Season 2's Halloween episode but has never taken any action about it) or someone who doesn't approve of romantic relationships and would transfer one or both people having one to separate branches (Jim and Pam in turn get this message and look thoughtful), and tells the office that they should mind what they're saying about him [...] "when I'm hiding in the bathroom pretending to be pooping." ...|$|E
