2500|$|A twine binder is a {{mechanical}} device or machine that wraps knotted twine around a bundle or sheave of grain in bound form {{after it has}} been reaped. While working at a farm in Whitewater, Wisconsin in 1857, John Appleby invented the <b>twine</b> <b>knotter.</b> Incorporating many of Jacob Behel's innovations as found in his development of the [...] "billhook" [...] knotter in 1864, Appleby later sold the patent around the year 1877 to William Deering who began the manufacturing and exploited the practicability of Appleby's <b>twine</b> <b>knotter</b> into a commercially profitable reaper-binder.|$|E

5000|$|Withington's {{original}} binder used wire {{to tie the}} bundles. There were {{various problems}} with using wire {{and it was not}} long before William Deering invented a binder that used <b>twine</b> and a <b>knotter</b> (invented in 1858 by John Appleby).|$|R
5000|$|Before the 19th century, hay {{was cut by}} {{hand and}} most {{typically}} stored in haystacks using hay forks to rake and gather the scythed grasses into optimal sized heaps [...] - [...] neither too large (promoting conditions that might create spontaneous combustion), nor too small, {{so much of the}} pile is susceptible to rotting. These haystacks lifted most of the plant fibers up off the ground, letting air in and water drain out, so the grasses could dry and cure, to retain nutrition for livestock feed at a later time. In the 1860s mechanical cutting devices were developed; from these came the modern devices including mechanical mowers and balers. In 1872 a reaper that used a knotter device to bundle and bind hay was invented by Charles Withington; this was commercialized in 1874 by Cyrus McCormick. [...] In 1936, Innes invented an automatic baler that tied bales with <b>twine</b> using Appleby-type <b>knotters</b> from a John Deere grain binder; an improved version patented by Ed Nolt in 1939 was more reliable and became commonly used.|$|R
