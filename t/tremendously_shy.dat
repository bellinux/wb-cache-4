50|$|In 1882, {{when she}} was sixteen, she met her second cousin, Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia in Altenburg. His mother and her father were first cousins; in {{addition}} to that, they shared Emperor Pavel I as a common ancestor. There was immediately some talk of marriage. However, although {{she said she was}} ready to marry Konstantin, he hesitated, although he was by then 24 years old. When she left, he promised to often write, but he never did, as he was <b>tremendously</b> <b>shy.</b> Nevertheless, he did write several poems about her. In 1884, she visited Russia and the wedding was announced, although she manifested her wish to keep her Lutheran faith, which was a serious blow for her future husband, since he believed firmly in the Russian Orthodox Church. Even worse was the fact that she refused to kiss the cross held in Orthodox services.|$|E
