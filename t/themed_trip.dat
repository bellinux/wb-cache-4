5000|$|Exotic {{landscapes and}} travel were popular <b>themes,</b> {{particularly}} <b>trips</b> to India, New Zealand, and the Arctic regions. Popular subjects in America were of river journeys, {{such as in}} Dunlap’s Trip to Niagara, and trips out west following the railroads that were quickly springing up as America expanded. Banvard's enormous Mississippi River panorama was shown {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic and a moving panorama of [...] "Romantic and Picturesque Scenery in the Environs of Hobart Town" [...] taken to London in 1839 allowed people in England to get an impression of Australia. A narrator explained the scenes passing in front of the audience and music played. In the United States, moving panoramas were popular throughout the 1850s and 1860s, with multiple touring shows operated by proprietors such as Edwin Beale, T.K. Treadwell, Henry Lewis and George K. Goodwin. Among the more popular subjects were the Arctic regions, major cities such as New York, the Mississippi River and Niagara Falls.|$|R

2500|$|In 1912, Méliès {{continued}} making ambitious films, {{most notably}} with the féerie The Conquest of the Pole. Although inspired by such contemporary events as Robert Peary's {{expedition to the}} North Pole in 1909 and Roald Amundsen's expedition to the South Pole in 1911, the film also included such fantastic elements as a griffith-headed aerobus and a snow giant that was operated by twelve stage hands, as well as elements reminiscent of Jules Verne {{and some of the}} same [...] "fantastic voyage" [...] <b>themes</b> as A <b>Trip</b> to the Moon and The Impossible Voyage. Unfortunately, Conquest of the Pole was not profitable, and Pathé decided to exercise its right to edit Méliès's films from then on.|$|R
50|$|Other oft-repeated {{elements}} include {{reading a}} story to Molly, who sometimes either chooses {{a story to}} hear, gives Loonette a book and oversized glasses, or turning on the lights for Loonette; encounters with the dust bunnies who live under the couch; visits to various places in Clowntown, songs that emphasize the episode's lessons or <b>themes,</b> and a <b>trip</b> to Granny Garbanzo's garden and house. Here she encounters Snicklefritz, Granny's cat; Major Bedhead, the local mail-delivery clown, who travels on a unicycle; and of course, Granny herself. The conversation with Granny is often used as the episode's teachable moment, where Granny offers Loonette advice or lessons, often {{with the help of}} Major Bedhead, who delivers gifts and messages from Auntie Macassar or Uncle Chester. All episodes end with Loonette and Molly having a nap and sometimes reminding the viewers to remember the rules on today's episode.|$|R
40|$|The tour brings {{together}} innovative land use change and management associated with dairy farming, and land-based effluent disposal, on weakly weathered and multi-layered, glass-rich, Pumice Soils (Vitrands) in the Taupo and Galatea areas. These changes and their effects, together with environmental and sustainability issues, form a central <b>theme</b> of the <b>trip.</b> Four main stops are planned, two before lunch and two after: (1) plantation pine-to-dairy farm conversion and impacts, the Taupo eruption deposits (AD 232 ± 10) and the Taupo soil, at Tahorakuri; (2) {{overview of the}} application of secondary-treated wastewater and nitrogen leaching and uptake, Rotokawa; (3) a sequence of five Holocene tephras and buried soils, including Kaharoa eruption deposits (AD 1314 ± 12) and the Galatea soil, Smeith Farm, Murupara; and (4) enhancing pasture production on ‘new’ soils formed by excavating and mixing (‘flipping’) buried soil horizons (paleosols) on Smeith’s farm. During the trip − which helps mark Waikato University’s 50 th anniversary − {{we will see a}} spectacular range of volcanic and fluvial landscapes and deposits, together with impacts of tectonism, as we traverse the famous Taupo Volcanic Zone ((TVZ) in the central volcanic region. Landforms and soils dominated by tephras (volcanic ash) become generally younger towards the loci of volcanic activity. Extensive areas of soils have been formed repeatedly from the fragmental eruptive products of the two most frequently active and productive rhyolite (silica-rich) volcanic centres known, namely Taupo and Okataina. Thus soil stratigraphy and upbuilding pedogenesis form a second <b>theme</b> on the <b>trip.</b> The first part of the guidebook thus contains sections including (i) volcanism and its products, (ii) Quaternary volcanism in TVZ including deposits erupted recently from Taupo and Tarawera volcanoes from which Pumice Soils have been formed, (iii) tephra-derived soils including Pumice Soils, their classification, special problems, and (low) fertility, (iv) allophane and its formation, and (v) the interplay between geological and pedological processes relating to tephras (upbuilding pedogenesis). The second part then comprises notes and illustrations pertaining to each stop (note that figure and table numbers are self-contained at each stop, or not used). Broad overviews of the region’s geology are covered by Leonard et al. (2010), and the soils are outlined by Rijkse and Guinto (2010) and S-map. Further compilations of data are available in tour guides by Lowe (2008) and Lowe et al. (2010) ...|$|R
5000|$|In December 2012, Xi visited Guangdong in {{his first}} trip outside of Beijing since taking the Party leadership. The {{overarching}} <b>theme</b> of the <b>trip</b> was to call for further economic reform and a strengthened military. Xi visited the statue of Deng Xiaoping and his trip was described as {{following in the footsteps}} of Deng's own southern trip in 1992, which provided the impetus for further economic reforms in China after conservative party leaders stalled many of Deng's reforms in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. On his trip, Xi consistently alluded to his signature slogan the [...] "Chinese Dream". [...] "This dream can be said to be the dream of a strong nation. And for the military, it is a dream of a strong military", Xi told sailors. Xi's trip was significant in that he departed from established convention of Chinese leaders' travel routine in multiple ways. Rather than dining out, Xi and his entourage ate regular hotel buffet. He traveled in a large van with his colleagues rather than a fleet of limousines, and did not restrict traffic on the parts of the highway he traveled on.|$|R
50|$|Wally Albright and {{the gang}} have planned for an {{elaborate}} camping trip for a week at Cherry Creek, but Wally's father is convinced his boy and the others will be back by nightfall. Meanwhile, Wally and Stymie try to shoo off Spanky and Scotty rather than to have to drag them along. Their reasoning is that the kids would never survive the trip, but upon arrival, Spanky and Scotty are already there after having hitchhiked {{their way to the}} site. This results in the <b>theme</b> of the <b>trip</b> with the younger boys reminding the older boys of their reluctance to have them around them. The little kids are also the only ones who planned far enough ahead to bring food, sharing it with the big kids in one big mob. As things get darker, the big kids get scared as the younger ones get excited, making shadows from their lamp which adds to the thunder and lightning passing over, inadvertently scaring off the older kids. Left alone, Scotty and Spanky are by themselves as their lamp is carried by a turtle under it into the creek, where it goes out. Spooked, they jump into their sleeping bags and stick their legs out to race after the big kids running home.|$|R

The First Lady traveled to China from March 19 to March 26, 2014. She visited Beijing, Xi’an and Chengdu. The <b>theme</b> of the <b>trip</b> is the importance of education. This comparative study investigates American and Chinese news coverage of Michelle Obama’s visit to China from March 19, 2014 to March 26, 2014. This study employed quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze a total 292 paragraphs from American media and 82 paragraphs from Chinese media. By systematically comparing the issue agenda and attribute agenda in American and Chinese media coverage, this study identified differences and similarities in both levels of agenda in the two countries’ media coverage. The findings showed that there were some significant differences in the issues covered between the Chinese and US press. The data suggested that diplomacy, foreign policy, freedom, human rights, race, and culture, (six out of these eleven) issues revealed significant differences between American and Chinese media. However, American and Chinese media seemed to employ similar attributes of the First Lady, which reflected certain gender stereotypes. Dominant ideology, glocalization and four theories of press were discussed to explain the differences of issue agenda between two countries...|$|R
40|$|This paper closely {{examines}} {{fairy tale}} films with road movie components, in particular those films featuring female protagonists. The study’s objective is twofold: first, to further develop existing {{research on the}} road movie by exploring one of the lesser known constituents of this broad genre and, second, to address gaps in scholarly literature on road movies {{when it comes to}} <b>themes</b> in female-led <b>trips</b> and the characterization of travelling females. Through a detailed analysis of the journeys of female characters in recent voyage-oriented fairy tale films—Peter Pan (P. J. Hogan, 2003), Alice in Wonderland (Tim Burton, 2010) and Tangled (Byron Howard and Nathan Greno, 2010) —the investigation shows that these new heroines significantly differ from those of old. Their travels are portrayed as being less difficult, and the traits that they exhibit while on the road, namely fearlessness, rationality and an undying optimism, are rather favourable when compared to those exhibited by former road heroines. Although these protagonists still face characters who wish to impede their movement away from a domestic setting, it is demonstrated that the protagonists are ultimately successful in not only acquiring power in the surroundings that they find themselves in, but also in carrying over their goals and dreams to their own worlds upon their return, privileges that most former road heroines did not have. Ultimately, the study shows that females can be as efficient travellers as males, and in some cases are portrayed as even more competent than their male counterparts...|$|R
