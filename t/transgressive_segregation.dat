50|$|There {{are many}} ways to test if <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> {{occurred}} within a population. One common way to test for <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> is to use a Dunnett's test. This test looks at whether the hybrid species' performance was different from the control group by looking whether or not the mean of the control group (parent species) differs significantly from mean of the other groups. If there is a difference, that is an indication of <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation.</b> Another commonly used test is the use of quantitative trait loci (QTL) to assess <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation.</b> Alleles with QTL that were opposed (either by overdomiance or underdominance) of the parental parent QTL indicate that <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> occurred. Alleles with QTL that was the same as the predicted parent QTL showed that there was no <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation.</b>|$|E

This study was conducted to identify Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) for Grain Length (GL), Grain Width (GW) and grain Length-width Ratio (LWR), which mainly represent grain dimension in rice, using recombinant inbred (RI) population derived from a cross between a japonica variety, Asominori and an indica variety, IR 24, grown in Japan (2002) and China (2005). Continuous distributions and <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregations</b> of GL, GW and LWR in rice were observed in the RI population, suggesting that grain dimension was quantitatively inherited trait. A total of ten QTLs for grain dimension were mapped to chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, which explained 7. 0 ~ 36. 6 % of total phenotypic variation and five out of them were commonly detected in the both countries.

The percentage of grains with hull rupture varied from 0 to 87 % among the parents. The diallel analysis revealed the following: the trait was predominantly controlled by the additive genes, and the dominance effect of some parents was also significant. However, the epistatic effect of the genes was not significant. The average dominance was 0. 97. The heritability value was estimated as 0. 57 and 0. 91 in a narrow and a broad sense, respectivelly. The percentage of grains with hull rupture showed continuous and <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregations</b> in 28 F 2 populations derived from half diallel crosses among eight parents.

The index scores of damage (representing Zn 2 + toxicity tolerance), after irrigating rice seedlings with a 1000 -ppm Zn 2 + solution for 20 successive days, were examined for each RI line and its parental varieties. Continuous distributions and <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregations</b> of the index scores were observed in the RI population, suggesting that Zn 2 + toxicity tolerance was a quantitatively inherited trait.

50|$|In genetics, <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> is the {{formation}} of extreme phenotypes, or transgressive phenotypes, observed in segregated hybrid populations compared to phenotypes observed in the parental lines. The appearance of these trangressive (extreme) phenotypes can be either positive or negative in terms of fitness. If both parents' favorable alleles come together, it {{will result in a}} hybrid having a higher fitness than the two parents. The hybrid species will show more genetic variation and variation in gene expression than their parents. As a result, the hybrid species will have some traits that are transgressive (extreme) in nature. <b>Transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> can allow a hybrid species to populate different environments/niches in which the parent species do not reside, or compete in the existing environment with the parental species.|$|E
50|$|In Kenya, {{there is}} an {{organism}} called septoria tritici blotch (STB) that diminishes yield in wheat crop. The parent species of wheat had little resistance toward STB, but the hybrid species due to <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> showed a higher resistance toward STB and therefore a higher fitness. You can create a higher resistance to STB by crossing genes together that are efficient. In result, out of 36 crosses there were 31 that showed a higher mean fitness than the control, parent value. These 31 crosses indicate a higher resistance to STB. The crosses used were from other commercial wheat's that were high yielding which is advantageous {{because there is a}} lower chance of deleterious (unwanted traits) appearing and therefore an increase in beneficial traits. <b>Transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> {{has been found to be}} useful to create a resistance toward this organism in order to increase the yield of wheat crop.|$|E
40|$|In this study, the Recombinant Inbred (RI) {{population}} {{derived from}} Asominori (japonica) / IR 24 (indica) {{were employed to}} identify Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) for six leaf-senescence associated traits during maturation in rice, viz., the flag Leaf Chlorophyll-Content (LCC) at heading (FCH) and maturity (FCM), the second-leaf LCC at heading (SCH) and maturity (SCM), the reduction-speed of flag-leaf LCC (RFC) and the second-leaf LCC (RSC). Resultantly, all continuous variations and <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregations</b> in the RI population were observed, indicating that the six traits were quantitatively inherited. A total of eighteen QTLs for the six traits were mapped to chromosome 2 (four QTLs), 3 (four QTLs), 4 (two QTLs), 6 (two QTLs), 8 (two QTLs), 9 (two QTLs), 11, 12, which could explained 11. 0 to 27. 8 % of the phenotypic variation. Interestingly, most LCC QTLs varied with leaf order and growth stage in rice. Among them, four QTLs for RFC and three ones for RSC, conferring the speed of flag- and the second leaf senescence, respectively, did not share the common genomic region {{each other and the}} all former alleles from japonica Asominori delayed leaf senescence and two of the latter alleles also from indica IR 24, whereas the remaining one from Asominori, showing that genetic basis of leaf senescence was different between flag- and the second leaf during maturation of rice.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the responses of}} flag leaf shape in rice to elevated CO 2 environment and their genetic characteristics, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for flag leaf shape in rice were mapped onto the molecular marker linkage map of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) derived from {{a cross between a}} japonica variety Asominori and an indica variety IR 24 under free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE, 200 μmol/mol above current levels) and current CO 2 concentration (Ambient, about 370 μmol/mol). Three flag-leaf traits, flag-leaf length (LL), width (LW) and the ratio of LL to LW (RLW), were estimated for each CSSL and their parental varieties. The differences in LL, LW and RLW between parents and in LL and LW within IR 24 between FACE and Ambient were significant at 1 % level. The continuous distributions and <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregations</b> of LL, LW and RLW were also observed in CSSL population, showing that the three traits were quantitatively inherited under both FACE and Ambient. A total of 16 QTLs for the three traits were detected on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 11 with LOD (Log 10 -likelihood ratio) scores ranging from 3. 0 to 6. 7. Among them, four QTLs (qLL- 6 *, qLL- 8 *, qLW- 4 *, and qRLW- 6 *) were commonly detected under both FACE and Ambient. Therefore, based on the different responses to elevated CO 2 in comparison with current CO 2 level, it can be suggested that the expressions of several QTLs associated with flag-leaf shape in rice could be induced by the high CO 2 level...|$|R

The strains were similar in virulence. There was a significant interaction between methods of inoculation (M) x concentration of inoculation (C) x genotype (G). ^ A second experiment was conducted to {{determine the amount of}} bacteria deposited into the leaves using the three inoculation methods. There were fewer bacteria in the leaves at time of inoculation and at 24 hr with the RB method than with the other methods in both varieties; the latter difference was not significant. ^ The dry seeds, flower buds, small pods, and green seeds of the individual plants of four dry bean cultivars/line (Bac- 6, Venezuela 44, Pompadour Checa, and GN Tara) were examined for possible internal bacterial infection after inoculating the plants at different sites. Inoculation of the pedicels of the flower buds and small pods resulted in transmission of the bacteria through the vascular tissue of the pod to the seeds. Planting infected seeds did not result in a systemic transmission of the bacteria in the vascular tissue of the plant to the seeds. The infected leaves were likely to be the main source for the external infection of the pods. ^ Leaf and pod disease reactions to strains of X c pv p were inherited quantitatively in crosses among five Phaseolus vulgaris cultivars/lines: Bac- 6 (mod. res.) x NE-EPl (mod. res.), Bat- 862 (mod. res.) x Pompadour Checa (sus.), Pompadour Checa (sus.) x Bac- 6 (mod. res.) and Venezuela 44 (sus.) x Bat- 862 (mod. res.). <b>Transgressive</b> <b>segregations</b> for resistance or susceptibility were observed.

5000|$|There {{are many}} causes for <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> in hybrids. One cause can {{be due to}} {{recombination}} of additive alleles. Recombination results in new pairs of alleles at two or more loci. These different pairs of alleles can give rise to new phenotypes since gene expression has been changed at these loci. Another cause can be elevated mutation rate. When mutation rates are high, it is more probable that a mutation will occur and cause an extreme phenotypic change. Reduced developmental stability is another cause for <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation.</b> Developmental stability refers to the capability of a genotype {{to go through a}} constant development of a phenotype in a certain environmental setting. If there is a disturbance due to genetic or environmental factors, the genotype will be more sensitive to phenotypic changes. Another cause arises from the interaction between two alleles of two different genes, also known as the epistatic effect. Epistasis is the event when one allele at a locus prevents an allele at another locus to express its product as if it is masking its effect. Therefore, epistasis can be related to gene over dominance caused by heterozygosity at specific loci.2 What this means is that the heterozygote (hybrid) when compared to the homozygote (parent) is better adapted and therefore shows more transgressive, extreme phenotypes. All of these causes lead to the appearance of these extreme phenotypes and creates a hybrid species that will deviate away from the parent species niche and eventually create an individual [...] "hybrid" [...] species.|$|E

40|$|Segregating hybrids often exhibit phenotypes {{that are}} extreme or novel {{relative}} to the parental lines. This phenomenon {{is referred to as}} <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation,</b> and it provides a mechanism by which hybridization might contribute to adaptive evolution. Genetic studies indicate that <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> typically results from recombination between parental taxa that possess quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with antagonistic effects (i. e. QTLs with effects that are in the opposite direction to parental differences for those traits). To assess whether this genetic architecture is common, we tabulated the direction of allelic effects for 3252 QTLs from 749 traits and 96 studies. Most traits (63. 6 %) had at least one antagonistic QTL, indicating that the genetic substrate for <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> is common. Plants had significantly more antagonistic QTLs than animals, which agrees with previous reports that <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> is more common in plants than in animals. Likewise, antagonistic QTLs were more frequent in intra- than in interspecific crosses and in morphological than in physiological traits.

40|$|Two accessions, {{representing}} the species Lycopersicon esculentum (cultivated tomato) and Lycopersicon pennellii (a wild relative), were evaluated for 11 quantitative traits {{and found to}} be significantly different for 10 of the traits. <b>Transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> was observed for eight of the traits in a large interspecific F(2) population. When restriction fragment length polymorphism markers were used as probes for the quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying the traits, 74 significant QTL (LOD > 2) were detected. Thirty-six percent of those QTL had alleles with effects opposite to those predicted by the parental phenotypes. These QTL were directly related to the appearance of transgressive individuals in the F(2) for those traits which showed transgressive segregration. However, the same types of QTL (with allelic effects opposite to those predicted by the parents) were also observed for traits that did not display <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> in the F(2). One such trait was dry weight accumulation. When two overdominant QTL (detected in the F(2)) for this trait were backcrossed into the L. esculentum genetic background, transgressive individuals were recovered and their occurrence was associated with the two QTL demonstrating the potential for <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> for all characters and implicating overdominance as a second cause of <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation.</b> Epistasis was not implicated in <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> in either the F(2) or backcross generations. Results from this research not only reveal the basis of wide-cross <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation,</b> but demonstrate that molecular markers can be used to identify QTL (from wild species) responsible for transgressive phenotypes and to selectively transfer them into crop species.

Studies on long-term effects of introgressive hybridization in animal systems are sparse. Drosophila nasuta (2 n = 8) and D. albomicans (2 n = 6) —a pair of allopatric, morphologically almost identical, cross-fertile members of the nasuta subgroup of the immigrans pecies group—constitute an excellent system to analyse the impact of hybridization fol-lowed by <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> of parental characters in the hybrid progeny.

40|$|Abstract Background Hybridization {{receives}} {{attention because}} of the potential role that it may play in generating evolutionary novelty. An explanation for the emergence of novel phenotypes is given by <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation,</b> which, if frequent, would imply an important evolutionary role for hybridization. This process is still rarely studied in natural populations as samples of recent hybrids and their parental populations are needed. Further, the detection of <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> requires phenotypes that can be easily quantified and analysed. We analyse variability in body shape of divergent populations of European sculpins (Cottus gobio complex) as well as natural hybrids among them. Results A distance-based method is developed to assign unknown specimens to known groups based on morphometric data. Apparently, body shape represents a highly informative set of characters that parallels the discriminatory power of microsatellite markers in our study system. Populations of sculpins are distinct and "unknown" specimens can be correctly assigned to their source population based on body shape. Recent hybrids are intermediate along the axes separating their parental groups but display additional differentiation that is unique and coupled with the hybrid genetic background. Conclusion There is a specific hybrid shape component in natural sculpin hybrids that can be best explained by <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation.</b> This inference of how hybrids differ from their ancestors provides basic information for future evolutionary studies. Furthermore, our approach may serve to assign candidate specimens to their source populations based on morphometric data and help in the interpretation of population differentiation. </p...|$|E

The latter includes differential genotype responses to ambient temperature and their interaction with photoperiod. Combinations of these largely independent environmental variables account for variation in heading date associated with differences in growing season conditions, particularly geographic region, sowing dates, and cultivar adaptation.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{nature of}} the genetic {{variation}} associated with a cross involving winter and spring wheat parents for four quality factors was evaluated. Yamhill, a soft white winter wheat, and Inia 66, a hard red spring wheat, were selected as parents for this study. They represented distinctly different phenotypes for the attributes measured. Parents, F₁, F₂ and reciprocal backcrosses were examined for protein and lysine content, kernel hardness, and sedimentation value. Significant differences were observed between the two parents for protein content. The F₁ mean was lower than the low protein parent with the F₂ mean intermediate between the two parents. This latter factor plus a high narrow sense heritability estimate suggest that the genetic variation associated with protein content was largely due to genes which act in an additive manner. Backcrosses to either parent shifted the population toward {{the mean of the}} recurrent parent. <b>Transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> was observed in the F₂ for both low and high protein content suggesting that selection for this trait should be effective in early generations. Parents differed significantly for lysine content with the winter parent, Yamhill displaying lysine values approaching the highest previously reported for wheat. Intermediate F₁ and F₂ population means and a high narrow sense heritability estimate suggest the genes involved function in an additive manner. The backcross progeny to Yamhill had a mean value approaching that of the recurrent parent. No <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> was observed in the F₂ for lysine content higher than Yamhill. It appears that lysine content in this cross is qualitatively inherited and that selection for improved lysine content above Yamhill appears limited. The genetic variation associated with kernel hardness appears to be largely additive with F₁ and F₂ means intermediate between the two parents and a high narrow sense heritability estimate. <b>Transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> was observed in the F₂ generation for both soft and hard kernel types. Selection for this trait should be effective in early generations. Significant differences were observed for the parental types for sedimentation value. The F₁ and F₂ means were below the midparent value. No <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> was observed in the F₂ for either low or high sedimentation value. One backcross to the low sedimentation parent brought the population back to the low parent mean. One backcross to the high sedimentation parent shifted the population toward the recurrent parent but no individuals were recovered that approached the high parent. From this study it appears that selection for high sedimentation value types would be very difficult.

Although the disease incidence was positively correlated with most of the agronomic traits, genotypes combining bunt resistance with good yield potential were isolated from ‘Svilena’ × A- 38 b set of lines. These genotypes are valuable for breeding varieties designed for growing in low-input and organic farming systems. The two DH populations are suitable to be used for further studies on the genetic basis of bunt resistance...|$|E
40|$|The first peanut crosses {{ever tried}} in Greece were {{performed}} over two growing seasons (1985 and 1986). The 13 successful crosses in 1985 {{belong to the}} following crossing schemes: Virginia x Spanish, Virginia x Valencia, Valencia x Virginia, Virginia x Virginia, Valencia x Valencia and Valencia x Spanish. The 7 successful crosses in 1986 belong to 2 crossing schemes: Virginia x Valencia and Virginia x Virginia. It resulted that in the climatic conditions of Greece {{a higher percentage of}} success can be achieved (16 %), when the crosses are realized as early as possible so that the high summer temperatures can be avoided. Also, the <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> for yield characteristics of 100 -pod weight and 100 -seed weight was studied during the years 1985 - 1990 in the Cotton Research Institute. Pedigree selection was applied from the F 3 to F 5 generation and segregated materials together with the parental varieties were evaluated. Most of the selections that showed <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> belonged to the cross type Virginia x Spanish. Data indicated that yield and quality of peanuts could be improved by exploiting the phenomenon of transgressive variation occurring principally in crosses between varieties that belong to peanut types Virginia and Spanish...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} the segregation of genes for {{resistance to the}} fungus Puccinia triticina in a cross between partially resistant wheat lines L- 574 - 1 and CI 13227 with two and four genes for resistance, respectively. The objectives {{of this study were}} to use parental, F 1, F 2, and backcross populations to quantify maternal effects, degree of dominance, and <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation,</b> and to determine whether CI 13227 and L- 574 - 1 share any resistance genes for long latent period or small uredinia. In two experiments conducted in the greenhouse, the uppermost leaf of adult wheat plants was inoculated prior to heading with P. triticina. On days 6 to 21 after inoculation, the number of uredinia that erupted from the leaf surface was counted and used to calculate the mean latent period (MLP). The length and width of five arbitrarily selected uredinia were measured and used to calculate uredinium area. Midparent values, degree of dominance, and broad-sense heritability were calculated for MLP and uredinium area. For experiment A, MLP values for CI 13227, L- 574 - 1, F 1, and F 2 generations were 12. 2, 10. 5, 10. 2, and 10. 6 days, respectively. For experiment B, MLP values for CI 13227, L- 574 - 1, F 1, F 2, backcross to CI 13227, and backcross to L- 574 - 1 were 12. 3, 10. 0, 10. 6, 10. 8, 11. 1, and 10. 0 days, respectively. The inheritance of long latent period was partially recessive, and no maternal effect was present (P = 0. 62 to 0. 87 for the comparison of means in reciprocal crosses). Broad-sense heritability for MLP ranged from 0. 72 to 0. 74, and there was <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> in the F 2 and backcross populations. Uredinia of the F 1 generation were slightly larger than uredinia for CI 13227. The inheritance of uredinium size was partially dominant, and no maternal effect was present (P = 0. 5 to 0. 63). Broad-sense heritability for uredinium area ranged from 0. 36 to 0. 73 and <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> was present in the F 2 and backcross populations. The results for MLP indicate that lines CI 13227 and L- 574 likely share one gene for resistance (based on F 1 values) but not two genes (based on the presence of <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation).</b> CI 13227 and L 574 - 1 appear to have at least one gene difference for uredinium area. The linear relationship between uredinium area regressed onto MLP was significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and r 2 values ranged from 0. 14 to 0. 26. These results indicate that the resistance in CI 13227 and L- 574 - 1 could be combined to create wheat cultivars with greater partial resistance than that possessed by either parent based on MLP or uredinium size...|$|E
40|$|Variation and {{transgressive}} segregations {{were studied}} in the backcross generations of populations involving three crosses in long bean [Vigna sesquipedalis (L.) Fruw]. Trends were different for different crosses. In Cross 1, high mean, variance and significant <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> (STS) pattern were exhibited by BC 2 F 1 generation for shelf life, pod yield per plant and pod weight. In Cross 2, high means were shown by BC 1 F 1 generations for shelf life and pod yield per plant, but high STS were observed in BC 2 F 1 generation for shelf life, BC 1 F 1 for pod yield per plant and BC 1 F 2 for pod weight. In Cross 3, BC 1 F 2 generation revealed high variances for shelf life, pod yield per plant and number of pods per plant, but highest STS values were revealed for BC 1 F 3 (selected) for shelf life and pod yield per plant, BC 2 F 1 for number of pods per plant, and BC 1 F 2 for pod weight. In general, shelf life {{was found to have}} exhibited high mean and STS in the BC 2 F 1 generation. Pod length, in general did not show good <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> in the crosses. Exploitation of these transgressive segregants in breeding programmes for improvement of the character of interest is suggested...|$|E

Both the hybrids revealed a reduced number of compounds {{compared with those}} of the parents. In addition, the spot pattern of each taxon offered a basis for analysis of inheritance pattern. Due to the production of clones with a consequent {{reduction in the number of}} sexual offspring by nucellar embryony in these plants, the unusual pattern of inheritance observed in the hybrids could not be categorized as either a product of disturbed Mendelian ratios or as <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> affecting only a few individuals in the segregating generations...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the possibility of obtaining recombinant inbred wheat lines more resistant to preharvest sprouting, independently of colour genes, in three red-grained Brazilian wheat populations. The results showed statistical significance among lines within all populations, which presented a normal distribution and <b>transgressive</b> <b>segregation</b> for preharvest sprouting. The normal distribution of the lines from all red-grained populations suggests that sprouting, excluding the genes expressing seed coat pigmentation, is, probably, controlled by many genes. These findings also indicate {{that it may be}} possible to improve resistance to preharvest sprouting, independently of the colour genes. 200...|$|E
