He {{reveals that the}} resistance fighter Paul Delamare worked with Marianne in France and {{would be able to}} identify her. Max seeks out a young pilot named Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph and instructs him to ask Delamare whether she really is Marianne. Max's commanding officer Frank Heslop informs him that Hunter was killed while waiting on the ground for the answer. Max also hears <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> operation might be a test, before he is given a vital job in the run-up to D-Day.|$|E
500|$|Controversy {{surrounded}} Branham {{from the}} early stages of his ministry. In 1947, a minister in Saskatchewan, Canada, stated that many Branham pronounced as healed later died. A year later, W. J. Taylor, a district superintendent with the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, raised the same concern and asked for a thorough investigation, presenting evidence that claims of the number of people healed were vastly overestimated. He stated that [...] "there is a possibility <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> thing is wrong".|$|E

Mayor Harvey Nelson explained: [...] "The ad is too much; that's just not true. There's objection <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> thing will be spreading fear in the community. There are relatives of the victims still living here, and this is very unpleasant to them." [...] Pierce worked with American International Pictures to remove the [...] "still lurking" [...] statement, but it remained on the posters.|$|E

500|$|Describing {{the various}} songs on Bleach, Christopher Sandford wrote: [...] "'Paper Cuts' {{includes}} a folk-influence melody and ponderous rhythm {{of an early}} Led Zeppelin number; 'Mr. Moustache' addressed itself to Nirvana's male fans; 'Downer' showed the same exceptional contempt for the group's audience". Sandford felt [...] "School" [...] – which features only four lines of lyrics – was memorable for its chorus that [...] "served as the rip". While [...] "Scoff" [...] is [...] "a parting salvo at [...] ", [...] "Negative Creep" [...] was written by Cobain about himself. According to Sandford, [...] "About a Girl" [...] has a [...] "chiming melody and ironic chorus". In Sounds magazine, Keith Cameron said the song [...] "was exhilarating and it was exciting {{because that was the}} nature of the music, but there was also an almost palpable sense of danger, <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> thing could fall apart any second. There was never any relaxation from the first note to the last". In his book Nirvana: The Stories Behind Every Song, Chuck Crisafulli writes that the song [...] "stands out in the Cobain canon as a song with a very specific genesis and a very real subject".|$|E
500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{called the}} episode [...] "a decent" [...] and [...] "moderately sharp" [...] season premiere. He {{concluded}} that, [...] "While the episode still wasn't {{on par with}} those of the show's earliest seasons, ... The episode wasn't lazy—and for The Office, that's a win." [...] Other reviews were slightly more mixed. TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode a three out of five, but was appreciative of the additions to the cast, as well as many of the actors story lines. Jeffrey Hyatt of Screencrave noted that the episode was similar in tone to the season eight finale, [...] "Free Family Portrait Studio", but that [...] "the addition of Lacy and Duke pay quick dividends as the opener provides flashes of comedy moxie, while helping wash away painful memories of last season." [...] David Hinckley of the New York Daily News awarded the episode three stars out of five and wrote that [...] "The deadpan goofiness remains fresh enough to keep fans interested" [...] and that [...] "the fact <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> drama doesn't feel new and shiny anymore isn't anyone's fault. ... All The Office needs to do now is march out proudly random, zany and off-center." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall, however, was critical of the episode's humor, noting that it [...] "didn't give me a lot of hope for a last-minute resurgence". Matt Roush of TV Guide wrote that the [...] "one interesting storyline" [...] may make him watch the remainder of Pam and Jim's story, but not [...] "the rest of this sadly played-out workplace comedy." ...|$|E

[...] "Last year, we sat down and took stock of all the good fortune and good times we'd enjoyed. And we basically – as you know, because you were invited – tried to put 200 {{of the people who were}} primarily responsible for us being inducted into the Hall of Fame in one room, in one place, for a couple of days.

2500|$|An {{interesting}} anecdote {{to consider}} was <b>that</b> during <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> period, Puerto Rico had laws like the Regla del Sacar or Gracias al Sacar {{by which a}} person of African ancestry could be considered legally white {{so long as they}} could prove that at least one person per generation in the last four generations had also been legally white descent.

60|$|How far {{it is true}} that Elizabeth {{loved the}} unfortunate Seymour can now never be known. There is no doubt, however, but <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> affair was a very severe trial and affliction to her. It came upon her when she was but {{fourteen}} or fifteen years of age, and when she was in a position, as well of an age, which renders the heart acutely sensitive both to the effect of kindness and of injuries. Seymour, by his death, was lost to her forever, and Elizabeth lived in great retirement and seclusion during the remainder of her brother's reign. She did not, however, forget Mrs. Ashley and Parry. On her accession to the throne, many years afterward, she gave them offices very valuable, considering their station in life, and was a true friend to them both to the end of their days.|$|E

There was something, too, inconceivably lonely in the situation. The unfurnished vacant room, the half-lights, the monstrous doll, whose very size seemed to give a pathetic significance to its speechlessness, the smallness of the one animate, self-centered figure--all these touched more or less deeply the half-poetic sensibilities of the woman. She could not help utilizing the impression as she stood there, and thought what a fine poem might be constructed from this material if the room were a little darker, the child lonelier--say, sitting beside a dead mother's bier, and the wind wailing in the turrets. And then she suddenly heard footsteps at the door below, and recognized the tread of the colonel's cane.|$|E

It had really been so, then. And yet here was the world resuscitated--here was life come back in an instant full tide to the planet. Now, as my eyes wandered all over the great landscape, I saw it in every direction--and moving, to my amazement, in the very same groove in which it had halted. There were the golfers. Was it possible that they were going on with their game? Yes, there was a fellow driving off from a tee, and that other group upon the green were surely putting for the hole. The reapers were slowly trooping back to their work. The nurse-girl slapped one of her charges and then began to push the perambulator up the hill. Everyone had unconcernedly taken up the thread at the very point where they had dropped it.|$|E
