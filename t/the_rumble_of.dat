25|$|While Napoleon was stalled {{by having}} to cross the Marne, Blücher planned to launch Yorck and Kaptzevich across the Ourcq at Crouy. Yorck found the Crouy bridge {{destroyed}} so he marched north to cross at Fulaines. Sacken was drawn into a noisy skirmish at Lizy and unable to lend support. Finding that his plans were not being carried out, at 6:00 pm Blücher ordered Kaptzevich to force a crossing at Gesvres. Despite being opposed by Doumerc's cavalry, the Russian corps commander pushed his leading elements onto the west bank. Marmont swiftly brought up his infantry and, after a stiff fight, overran Kaptzevich's small bridgehead, capturing 280–300 Russians. Kleist's attack also failed, leaving {{both sides in the}} same position as before. That night Poret de Morvan's division marched into the French camp accompanied by <b>the</b> <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> 48 guns and loud cheers. Despite their great numerical advantage, the morale of the Allied soldiers sank.|$|E
500|$|Inspired by the Velvet Underground's {{production}} and the direct approach of punk rock band Ramones, the miking scheme for the drum kit included only three microphones: one above it, one for the bass drum, {{and one in the}} corner of the studio. It was crafted to capture [...] "a compressed, explosive sound". On Moretti's advice, the transfer from the two loud guitars and <b>the</b> <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> the bass picked up by the drum-kit microphones was not eliminated. The guitars were recorded more simply; Hammond and Valensi both used Fender DeVille amps on opposite sides of the room, while Raphael positioned a mic on each. The sound was then fed directly into a preamp with no equalization. Valensi commented that guitar teacher and mentor Bowersock was invaluable because he was articulating things to the producer that the group could not. While the rest of the Strokes played to a click track, Casablancas sang through a small Peavey practice amp to retain a sense of low fidelity on the album. Raphael mixed as he went along to maintain control of the record until the final mastering stage; the producer aimed to show the Strokes a final product as soon as the band finished performing a track.|$|E

60|$|For a minute, {{if it had}} {{not been}} for <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carriage, you might have heard a pin drop.|$|R
60|$|Her {{companion}} neither answered nor moved. She {{thought that}} perhaps <b>the</b> <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> the heavy caleche had drowned her voice.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> a gong reached us from below. Cecil {{stopped short}} {{in his speech}} and hurried {{me out of the}} room.|$|E
6000|$|When he {{had gone}} we stood silent, till <b>the</b> <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> his {{carriage}} wheels died away. The first to speak was Doctor Winchester: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "While {{we were so}} employed, we were {{interrupted}} by a strange sound. We likened it to <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> <b>of</b> wheels in <b>the</b> corridor outside.|$|R
60|$|Uncas did as {{the other}} had directed, and when the voice of Hawkeye ceased, {{the roar of the}} {{cataract}} sounded like <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> <b>of</b> distant thunder.|$|R
6000|$|She was {{too proud}} to ask him for his confidence, {{and at that moment}} <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> <b>of</b> a gong reached them from the distant hall. Mrs. de Vaux rose:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Starboard!" [...] said Grahame, {{and there}} was silence except for <b>the</b> <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> the surf, while the {{quartermaster}} turned his wheel in the glass-fronted house.|$|E
60|$|Even as he spoke, {{they heard}} <b>the</b> <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> chain through hawse-pipe, {{and from the}} veranda saw a big black-painted schooner, {{swinging}} to her just- caught anchor.|$|E
60|$|As the {{consciousness}} expands on learning {{that what was}} fancied to be <b>the</b> <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> wheels is the reverberation of thunder, so did Bathsheba's at her intuitive conviction.|$|E
60|$|The denunciations of {{the mate}} {{continued}} {{for some time}} longer, and then went off like <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> <b>of</b> distant thunder in the heavens {{after the passage of}} the gust.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rumbles</b> <b>of</b> World War II, and the {{resulting}} materials shortages and related financial troubles, forced the company to file for bankruptcy on October 1, 1941. The Methuen Organ Shop {{burned to the ground}} on June 17, 1943.|$|R
60|$|Mary Brander was, as usual, called before {{daylight}} by Margot, and was dressing when a {{sound like}} <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> <b>of</b> a heavy wagon, caused her to pause suddenly, and then hurry {{to the window and}} throw it open.|$|R
60|$|As they {{approached}} the village, they heard a deep, hollow sound, and stopping to listen, and laying their ears to the ground, could distinguish <b>the</b> <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> heavy carriages.|$|E
60|$|Even as {{he spoke}} there came from far away through the {{darkness}} {{the sound of a}} fast trotting pair of horses and <b>the</b> <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> coach-wheels on the unpaved road.|$|E
60|$|All gazed in the {{direction}} mentioned and saw heavy black clouds just showing over the treetops. The clouds advanced rapidly, soon covering the sun. Then came <b>the</b> <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> distant thunder.|$|E
50|$|Another {{suggested}} {{explanation is}} that <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> <b>of</b> an approaching water cart sounded like the firing of artillery, thus causing a false alarm. It {{is also used to}} refer to a foolish mistake, although the etymology of that is uncertain.|$|R
60|$|At last, just as {{from every}} church tower the bells strike {{the hour of}} nine, there comes the muffled sound of a distant cavalcade: the sound of horses {{galloping}} and only half drowning that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> <b>of</b> coach wheels.|$|R
60|$|Presently a great {{rain drop}} was blown against the youth's face; the {{vividness}} of the lightning had increased; <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thunder {{had grown to}} the proportions of a titanic bombardment; but he dared not pause to seek shelter.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} {{tried to stop}} her in her course, to change her mood, which was {{descending}} to real feeling. His low words were lost in <b>the</b> <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> the car.|$|E
6000|$|This {{time the}} giant spoke; {{his voice was}} very terrible, for it was <b>the</b> <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> thunder in the clouds. 'Who is it,' he said, 'making that fire {{smoulder}} around my feet?' ...|$|E

60|$|The {{natural result}} of this indulgence was that he soon fell asleep, and even <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trains as they passed failed to awaken him, until after some time, when {{he became aware of}} a tugging and pulling at his coat.|$|R
60|$|As Flynn {{descended the}} ladder while he spoke, {{the sense of}} what he said was lost, but the truth of his opinion still {{continued}} to receive illustration from <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> <b>of</b> his voice, until it was swallowed up {{in the depths of the}} vessel.|$|R
50|$|Shortly after {{competing}} in <b>the</b> Royal <b>Rumble</b> <b>of</b> 1992, Haku left the WWF.|$|R
60|$|Above the thud of the coach-horses' hoofs and <b>the</b> <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> {{their vehicle}} sounded now {{the clatter of}} someone {{galloping}} madly in their wake. Mademoiselle looked from the window into the gathering dusk.|$|E
60|$|Then a {{few minutes}} later, she heard the Jew's husky voice again, evidently {{shouting}} to his nag, then <b>the</b> <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> wheels, and noise of a rickety cart bumping over the rough road.|$|E
6000|$|... "We won't heave anchor unless we're forced to; it's not an {{enticing}} night," [...] Grahame replied, and Walthew nodded, as in {{the pause}} that followed he heard <b>the</b> <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> the surf upon the shoals.|$|E
60|$|As I lay there, there arose out of {{the utter}} stillness <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> <b>of</b> a {{carriage}} a very great way off, that drew near, and passed within a few streets of the house, and died away as gradually as it had arisen. This, too, was as a reminiscence.|$|R
60|$|It {{was still}} dark, but she began moving {{about the house}} in those {{automatic}} initiatory acts and touches which represent among housewives the installation of another day.
