40|$|Since the 1980 s, various {{processes}} of economic globalisation have eroded established found-ations of organised labour. The increased mobility {{of goods and}} capital, compared to labour's relative immobility, has {{made it more difficult}} for labour to advance its objectives through traditional local industrial action or <b>tripartite</b> <b>social</b> <b>contracts.</b> In this paper, we are concerned with the social regulation of global value chains (GVCs) and more specifically the room for manoeuvre that organised labour has for advancing social regulation in different GVCs via Private Social Standards and/ or International Framework Agreements. We argue, that the governance structure (and restructuring) of GVCs frame key elements of the terrain that enables and constrains labour's strategic opportunities for advancing the social regulation of GVCs. Empirically, the paper is based on detailed case studies of the banana and cut flower value chains. Based on the cases we argue, first of all, that a high level of drivenness constitutes a precondition for social regulation along a GVC strand to take place. Secondly, the functional position of the drivers (e. g. producer- and buyer-driven contexts) determines the particular terrains on which contests for the social regulation of GVCs take place and creates different leverage points that may be activated to achieve social regulation. Thirdly, it is historically and locally specific levels of workplace organisation and trade union resources that determine how labour in practice exercises its agency towards social regulation. The reorganisation of GVCs, while seriously constraining some of the more traditional trade union strategies, nevertheless opens new opportunities and new leverage points that can be strategically exploited by labour. The social standard mechanisms reviewed in this paper illustrate some of the new instruments that in addition to other labour strategies constitute potential fruitful avenues in particular GVC terrains...|$|R

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>contracts</b> play an {{important}} role in defining the reciprocal rights, obligations, and responsibilities between states and citizens.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>contract</b> {{arguments}} frequently rely on non-contractual considerations {{to justify}} principles or types of government. Either, the moral assumptions that structure a contractarian 2 ̆ 7 s bargaining position {{are derived from}} a non-contractual basis or those moral assumptions, and not hypothetical agreement, do the justificatory work. These problems are formal. If correct, they show that the structure of contractarian justification necessarily relies on a non-contractual basis. My dissertation addresses whether <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> arguments can avoid problematically relying on non-contractual considerations and, if so, how? ^ I answer these questions by looking past particular <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> theories and focusing on the structural relationship between the different elements of <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> arguments. To overcome the formal challenges, <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> theorists must present an argument that structurally meets three criteria. First, the argument must be independently significant and avoid relying on non-contractual moral assumptions. Second, insofar as the argument uses moral assumptions, the argument should, in principle, provide some warrant for them. Doing so ensures that contract argument does not rest on unlicensed moral assumptions. Finally, invoking the <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> argument must be important given how the argument licenses its conclusions. If another type of argument can justify moral principles on the same basis without invoking a <b>social</b> <b>contract,</b> the <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> argument is irrelevant. ^ I develop an independent type of <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> argument that structurally affords hypothetical choices non-derivative, moral significance and justifies principles in terms of them. I do so by reinterpreting two central elements {{of the structure of}} <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> arguments. First, I challenge the traditional understanding of how choices in the bargaining position relate to the assumptions structuring that position. Rather than view the moral assumptions as constraining otherwise insignificant hypothetical choices, I argue the moral assumptions constitute the significance of those choices. The structuring assumptions ensure the hypothetical choices represent choosing in a morally significant way. Second, in contrast to the traditional top-down structure of the argument, I defend a coherentist understanding of <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> arguments where agreement in the bargaining stage serves as the standard of coherence. ...|$|R
5000|$|The most {{prominent}} difference between Murray Rothbard’s brand of Austro-libertarianism—as espoused in his book, The Ethics of Liberty,—and libertarian Christianity revolves around his {{rejection of the}} <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> theory of government. Libertarian Christians have Bible-based concepts of natural law and the <b>social</b> <b>contract.</b> In contrast, Rothbard believes in natural law, {{but he does not}} believe in any viable <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> theory. In John Locke's Second Treatise on Civil Government, Locke speaks of people surrendering natural rights in the process of entering a <b>social</b> <b>contract,</b> or more specifically, trading rights for the benefits of participation in the <b>social</b> <b>contract.</b> He indicates that this is a voluntary and consensual process. But Locke fails to show how, once the <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> is established, the offspring of the original contract-makers volunteer into the contract, and thereby perpetuate the consensual nature of the original contract. This is the first of two major problems that Rothbard sees in the <b>social</b> <b>contract.</b> Rothbard recognizes this flaw not only in Locke’s philosophy, but also in the organic documents of the United States. The second problem arises by way of Rothbard’s commitment to a strict [...] "title-transfer" [...] theory of contracts. Because of these two problems, Rothbard rejects the <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> theory of government. --- Rather than rejecting the <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> because of these two problems, libertarian Christians use biblical exegesis to solve them. To solve the first problem, libertarian Christianity shows how offspring of the original contract-makers either enter the contract voluntarily and consensually, or do not enter it at all (thereby removing themselves from the <b>social</b> <b>contract’s</b> jurisdiction). To solve the second problem, libertarian Christians hold to a [...] "property-interest" [...] theory of contracts that allows for the alienation of interests in labor and actions, even though they agree with Rothbard regarding the inalienability of the human will. The implications of these distinctions are huge, in the view of libertarian Christians, because, in their view, Rothbard’s anarcho-capitalism is inherently dysfunctional without a <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> that is understood to have a perpetual existence.|$|R

This paper considers the variant of the <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> that has arguably gained the most attention among business ethicists: integrative <b>social</b> <b>contracts</b> theory or ISCT [Donaldson and Dunfee: 1999, Ties That Bind (Harvard Business School Press, Boston) ]. A core precept of ISCT – that consent to membership in an organization entails obligations to follow the norms of that organization, subject to the moral minimums of basic human rights – is a reasonable and appealing notion. One potential challenge for those attempting to apply this idea, however, lies in the dynamic nature of social norms. Organizational norms evolve, often through the conscious efforts of community members and leaders. As currently formulated, ISCT offers a framework that under-appreciates the evolving nature of moral norms.
