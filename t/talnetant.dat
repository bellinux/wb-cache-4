50|$|<b>Talnetant</b> (SB-223,412) is a neurokinin 3 {{receptor}} antagonist {{developed by}} GlaxoSmithKline, {{which is being}} researched for several different functions, primarily for irritable bowel syndrome however its use as a potential antipsychotic drug {{for the treatment of}} schizophrenia has been discontinued.|$|E
40|$|<b>Talnetant</b> and osanetant, two {{structurally}} diverse antagonists of neurokinin- 3 receptor (NK 3), displayed distinct {{modes of}} action in Ca 2 mobilization. Although <b>talnetant</b> showed a normal Schild plot with a slope close to unity and a Kb similar to its Ki value in binding, osanetant presented an aberrant Schild with a steep slope (3. 3 0. 5) and a Kb value (12 nM) significantly elevated compared with its Ki value (0. 8 nM) in binding. Kinetic binding experiments indicated a simple one-step binding mechanism with relatively fast on- and off-rates for both antag-onists, arguing against slow onset of antagonism {{as the reason for}} abnormal Schild. This conclusion was supported by pro-longed preincubation of antagonist that failed to improve the observed aberrant Schild. In ligand cross-competition binding, both <b>talnetant</b> and osanetant displayed linear reciprocal plots of identical slope when [MePhe 7]neurokinin B (NKB) was used as the other competition partner with 125 I-[MePhe 7]NKB as the radioligand, indicating competitive binding of either antagonist with regard to [MePhe 7]NKB. Similar patterns were obtained when <b>talnetant</b> was tested against osanetant, indicating com-petitive binding between the two antagonists as well. These results were reproduced when [3 H] 4 -quinolinecarboxamide (SB 222200), a close derivative of <b>talnetant,</b> was used as the radioligand. Taken together, these data strongly suggest bind-ing of both <b>talnetant</b> and osanetant at the orthosteric binding site with similar kinetic properties and do not support the hypothesis that the aberrant Schild observed in functional as-says for osanetant is derived from differences in the mecha-nism of binding for these NK 3 antagonists. Neurokinins (NKs) are a family of at least three neuropep-tides, substance P, neurokinin A, and neurokinin B (NKB), with each mediating their biological effects through binding to a preferred G-protein-coupled receptor termed NK 1, NK 2, or NK 3, respectively (Holmes et al., 2003; Almeida et al. ...|$|E
40|$|NK 1 and NK 3 receptors do {{not appear}} to play {{significant}} roles in normal GI functions, but both may be involved in defensive or pathological processes. NK 1 receptor antagonists are antiemetic, operating via vagal sensory and motor systems, so {{there is a need to}} study their effects on other gastro-vagal functions thought to play roles in functional bowel disorder's. Interactions between NK 1 receptors and enteric nonadrenergic, noncholinergic motorneurones suggest a need to explore the role of this receptor in disrupted colonic motility. NK 1 receptor antagonism does not exert consistent analgesic activity in humans, but similar studies have not been carried out against pain of GI origin, where NK 1 receptors may have additional influences on mucosal inflammatory or ‘irritant' processes. NK 3 receptors mediate certain disruptions of intestinal motility. The activity may be driven by tachykinins released from intrinsic primary afferent neurones (IPANs), which induce slow EPSP activity in connecting IPANs and hence, a degree of hypersensitivity within the enteric nervous system. The same process is also proposed to increase C-fibre sensitivity, either indirectly or directly. Thus, NK 3 receptor antagonists inhibit intestinal nociception via a ‘peripheral' mechanism that may be intestine-specific. Studies with <b>talnetant</b> and other selective NK 3 receptor antagonists are, therefore, revealing an exciting and novel pathway by which pathological changes in intestinal motility and nociception can be induced, suggesting a role for NK 3 receptor antagonism in irritable bowel syndrome...|$|E
