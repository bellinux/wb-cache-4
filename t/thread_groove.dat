40|$|Abstract. Processing through {{volumetric}} cold {{plastic deformation}} (cold rolling) with flat wedge tools is a procedure used in mass production to process profiles (circular, <b>threads,</b> <b>grooves,</b> teeth) on revolution pieces. Complex profiles obtained by cold plastic deformation with flat wedge tools have important advantages: material economy, high productivity, continuous fibre, superior mechanic properties, low {{values of the}} roughness parameters, low costs. In recent years, the simulation of processes of volumetric plastic deformation by the finite element method is used to obtain the optimization of the deformation process and {{the improvement of the}} product quality even from the design stage. By numerical simulation there is observed the evolution during the process of different parameters such as: stress and deformations in the deformed body, mode of material flow, final shape and sizes of the product etc. Therefore, it becomes possible to analyse the process even from the design stage by identifying the problems which can appear and their influence on some characteristics of the product obtained: geometry, state of deformations and stress. This paper presents the experimental determination of the deformation force at the processing of complex profiles with flat wedge tools and the influence of the friction coefficient between tool and semi-product on its value; influence established by simulating the deformation process. The process also has been simulated by means of finite element calculations using the Abaqus/Explicit code. The material behaviour is described by using a 5 -parameter strain-hardening law and by accounting for thermal effects at high strain-rates. The comparison between the values and the variation of the deformation force recorded experimentally and at simulation allows establishing the optimal value of the friction coefficient and validating the numerical model developed...|$|R
50|$|Almost all {{high-performance}} {{cutting tools}} use indexable inserts. There {{are several reasons}} for this. First of all, at the very high cutting speeds and feeds supported by these materials, the cutting tip can reach temperatures high enough to melt the brazing material holding it to the shank. Economics are also important; inserts are made symmetrically {{so that when the}} first cutting edge is dull they can be rotated, presenting a fresh cutting edge. Some inserts are even made {{so that they can be}} flipped over, giving as many as 16 cutting edges per insert. There are many types of inserts: some for roughing, some for finishing.

5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck.

Clearly, long cycle times cause high inventory, high cost and very poor customer service. Cycle time reduction has a good predictable role in operation of CNC and Non-Conventional machining processes. Reducing cycle time requires eliminating non-value added activities which does not add value to the product manufactured. Examples of non-value added activity includes machine set-up, inspection and scheduled delays. The parameters considered in this context are speed, feed, depth of cut, hand-offs etc., these parameters should not violate any of the constraints that may apply on the process and satisfy the objective function such as reducing cycle time, maximizing the production rate, reduction in costs, increase throughput, streamline process, improved communications, process variability reduction or combinations of the above functions.

40|$|Wakelin {{and colleagues}} {{developed}} {{a series of}} bisintercalating threading dimers of 9 -aminoacridine- 4 -carboxamides designed to be cytotoxic {{as a result of}} the template inhibition of transcription. They are intended to bisintercalate into DNA from the minor <b>groove,</b> <b>thread</b> their carboxamide side chains through the helix, and hydrogen bond to the O 6 /N 7 atoms of guanine in the major groove. These side chain-guanine interactions make withdrawal of the intercalated chromophores difficult, slow ligand dissociation, and provide a long-lived block to RNA polymerase. Here, we have explored ways of further slowing DNA-ligand dissociation rates by structural modifications within the bis(9 -aminoacridine- 4 -carboxamide) threading paradigm. Firstly, we fused a benzene ring to the acridine at the 5, 6 -position to increase its surface area, with the intent of enhancing its base pair stacking interactions. Secondly, we modified the 4 -carboxamide threading side chain, within the 5, 6 -benzacridine series, by elaborating the parent N,N-dimethylaminoethyl group into a N,N-diisopropylaminoethyl group, to enhance its base pair interactions by providing a bulkier moiety to thread through the intercalation cavity. Both modifications are intended to enhance cytotoxic potency as a consequence of providing a longer-lived block to RNA polymerase. In the work presented here, we report the design and synthesis of the new threading dimers; their cytotoxicity in human leukaemia CCRF-CEM cells; evaluate their capacity to cause cell cycle arrest using flow cytometry; investigate their ability to titrate DNA supercoiling on agarose gels; examine their DNA-complex dissociation kinetics; and probe the structure of their bisintercalated complexes by energy minimisation and molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the molecular modelling studies suggest the dimers form stereochemically and energetically stable bisintercalated threading complexes as intended; that the dimers remove and reverse DNA supercoiling in the manner of intercalating agents; that the 5, 6 -benz substitution slows dissociation rates as anticipated, but that the diisopropyl substitution generally speeds up dissociation; that neither substitution enhances cytotoxic potency; and that none of the novel agents cause cell cycle arrest. That the diisopropyl side chain diminishes complex lifetimes suggests the mechanism of dissociation is different for the two threading side chains, and that that for the more bulky group involves base pair opening...|$|R
40|$|In {{his article}} {{reporting}} {{the results of}} a new prototype phacoemulsification tip with internal <b>grooves</b> (<b>threaded</b> tip), Watanabe 1 showed that the threaded tip can amplify the cavitation effect and that intensification of cavitation gives a higher phacoemulsification effect. We have also investigated the role of the phaco tip when ultrasound (US) energy with an ultra-speed video recording system is applied by analyzing the stroke motion and the surface constitution before and after surgery. Based on our data and the frames of the videos, we assume that the shape of the phaco tip correlates to sections where the deterioration effect of cavitation is seen. This suggests that generation of the turbulence waves also depends on the tip design. In 2005, we described a technique for visualizing fluid turbulence and cavitation created by a US phaco tip and suggested that cavitation was involved in fragmentation of the nucleus. 2 The study by Zacharias 3 indicates that there is no relationship between cavitation and phacoemulsification power; moreover, he found that cavitation does not improve cutting function. Watanabe often references Zacharias’ work, often to support his own work, but attempts to contradict it if we consider the conclusion expressed above. Another consideration to evaluate is related to the fact that grooves create more cavitation. This is not a positive and safe result if the tissue damage effect and the dispersion of metal fragments in the anterior chamber are considered. Clinical studies show that cavitation {{may play a role in}} decreasing endothelial cells. 2 and 4 The application of high-intensity US energy in the aqueous media can generate acoustic cavitation with the concomitant generation of free radicals and sonoluminescence, a phenomenon in which electronically excited species cause the emission of a light flash. It can also cause localized high pressure and temperature elevation. 2 All these factors can cause tissue damage. Nevertheless, we strongly believe that the grooves, as designed by Watanabe, provide traction and mechanical adherence that could give the user a feeling of less chatter and can improve gripping capacity. In conclusion, we consider Watanabe’s study interesting and innovative and think that future studies should consider the potential role of the change of the tip surface to increase the gripping adherence and to reduce the chattering effect of the phaco tip...|$|R
40|$|The {{explosive}} growth of Internet-based architectures is allowing an efficient {{access to information}} resources over geographically dispersed areas. This fact is exerting {{a major influence on}} current manufacturing practices. Business activities involving customers, partners, employees and suppliers are being rapidly and efficiently integrated through networked information management environments. Therefore, efforts are required to take advantage of distributed infrastructures that can satisfy information integration and collaborative work strategies in corporate environments. In this research, Internet-based distributed solutions focused on the manufacturing industry are proposed. Three different systems have been developed for the tooling sector, specifically for the company Seco Tools UK Ltd (industrial collaborator). They are summarised as follows. SELTOOL is a Web-based open tool selection system involving the analysis of technical criteria to establish appropriate selection of inserts, toolholders and cutting data for turning, <b>threading</b> and <b>grooving</b> operations. It has been oriented to world-wide Seco customers. SELTOOL provides an interactive and crossed-way of searching for tooling parameters, rather than conventional representation schemes provided by catalogues. Mechanisms were developed to filter, convert and migrate data from different formats to the database (SQL-based) used by SELTOOL. TTS (Tool Trials System) is a Web-based system developed by the author and two other researchers to support Seco sales engineers and technical staff, who would perform tooling trials in geographically dispersed machining centres and benefit from sharing data and results generated by these tests. Through TTS tooling engineers (authorised users) can submit and retrieve highly specific technical tooling data for both milling and turning operations. Moreover, it is possible for tooling engineers to avoid the execution of new tool trials knowing the results of trials carried out in physically distant places, when another engineer had previously executed these trials. The system incorporates encrypted security features suitable for restricted use on the World Wide Web. An urgent need exists for tools to make sense of raw data, extracting useful knowledge from increasingly large collections of data now being constructed and made available from networked information environments. This {{explosive growth}} in the availability of information is overwhelming the capabilities of traditional information management systems, to provide efficient ways of detecting anomalies and significant patterns in large sets of data. Inexorably, the tooling industry is generating valuable experimental data. It is a potential and unexplored sector regarding the application of knowledge capturing systems. Hence, to address this issue, a knowledge discovery system called DISKOVER was developed. DISKOVER is an integrated Java-application consisting of five data mining modules, able to be operated through the Internet. Kluster and Q-Fast are two of these modules, entirely developed by the author. Fuzzy-K has been developed by the author in collaboration with another research student in the group at Durham. The final two modules (R-Set and MQG) have been developed by another member of the Durham group. To develop Kluster, a complete clustering methodology was proposed. Kluster is a clustering application able to combine the analysis of quantitative as well as categorical data (conceptual clustering) to establish data classification processes. This module incorporates two original contributions. Specifically, consistent indicators to measure the quality of the final classification and application of optimisation methods to the final groups obtained. Kluster provides the possibility, to users, of introducing case-studies to generate cutting parameters for particular Input requirements. Fuzzy-K is an application having the advantages of hierarchical clustering, while applying fuzzy membership functions to support the generation of similarity measures. The implementation of fuzzy membership functions helped to optimise the grouping of categorical data containing missing or imprecise values. As the tooling database is accessed through the Internet, which is a relatively slow access platform, it was decided to rely on faster Information retrieval mechanisms. Q-fast is an SQL-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) application, Implemented for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study undertaken {{to investigate the}} seismic behavior of full scale square (300 x 300 mm) RC columns strengthened with two alternative systems employing carbon FRP wraps. The first system (“type A”) consists of placing four steel <b>threaded</b> rods inside <b>grooves</b> cut into the concrete which were anchored into {{the foundation for a}} length of about 250 mm; then the strengthening is completed by external CFRP confinement. The second system (“type B”), instead, differs from the first one for the additional use of steel profiles at the column corners. Tests were performed by subjecting the specimens to combined axial and lateral loads applied in displacement control. A value of the normalized compression load (NCL) equal to 0. 40 was considered for all tests except one for which NCL = 0. 14 was adopted. Table 1 summarizes the main data and results of the six performed tests. Each test is identified by a label providing the following information: the column number (from C 1 to C 5) with the addition of “NS” (i. e., “new series”) the longitudinal steel reinforcement type (“D” stands for deformed rebars); the strengthening system (type ‘‘A’’ or ‘‘B’’). It is noted that the test C 1 NS-D-R refers to the control specimen C 1 NS-D that, after being tested, was repaired and FRP retrofitted according to the layout “type A”. In order to better compare the effectiveness of the considered strengthening techniques, Table 1 also reports data and results of two tests performed in a previous experimental campaign, namely C 24 -D-A 1 and C 15 -D-A 1. These specimens were strengthened using a system “type A 1 ”, characterized by the combined use of CFRP confinement and steel profiles connected to the foundation by using an L-shape steel system. Under high axial load (NCL= 0. 40) the strengthened specimens have exhibited increases of strength ranging from 48 to 60 %. The improvement of the column’s confinement through the addition of steel profiles (system “type B”) avoids the rupture of the FRP wrapping and delays the crushing of the concrete; indeed, after the achievement of the conventional collapse, the strengthened specimens are still capable of undergoing significant lateral displacements. By focusing on the system “type A”, it is highlighted that using a double FRP layer (test C 3 NS-D-A) delays the FRP fracture, so that the displacements exhibited by the specimen are about 30 % over those measured for the counterpart confined with a single FRP layer...|$|R
