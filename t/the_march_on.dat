5|$|At the time, {{according}} to German sociologist , Vizzini {{could easily have}} had himself elected as a parliamentary deputy. Nevertheless, he preferred {{to remain in the}} background and instead advise voters and elected officials, playing the role of benevolent benefactor, strengthening his clientele and prestige. He was present at a dinner in July 1922 with the future ruler of Italy, Benito Mussolini, in Milan and supported <b>the</b> <b>March</b> <b>on</b> Rome by Mussolini in October 1922, financing the column that marched from Sicily.|$|E

5|$|Plutarch {{makes no}} further mention of events until the initial {{confrontation}} between Marcus Licinius Crassus and Spartacus {{in the spring}} of 71 BC, omitting <b>the</b> <b>march</b> <b>on</b> Rome and the retreat to Thurii described by Appian. However, as Plutarch describes Crassus forcing Spartacus' followers to retreat southwards from Picenum, it could be inferred that the rebel slaves approached Picenum from the south in early 71 BC, implying that they withdrew from Mutina into southern or central Italy for the winter of 72–71 BC.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{co-operation}} in the AFL-CIO merger, Meany and Reuther had {{a contentious}} relationship for many years. In 1963, Meany and Reuther disagreed about <b>the</b> <b>March</b> <b>on</b> Washington for Jobs and Freedom, {{a major event}} {{in the history of}} the civil rights movement in the United States. Meany opposed AFL-CIO endorsement of the march. In an AFL-CIO executive council meeting on August 12, Reuther's motion for a strong endorsement of the march was supported by only A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the titular leader of the march. The AFL-CIO endorsed a civil rights law and allowed individual unions to endorse the march. When Meany heard Randolph's speech after the march, he was visibly moved. Thereafter, he supported the creation of the A. Philip Randolph Institute to strengthen labor unions among African Americans and to strengthen ties with the African American community. Randolph said that he was sure that Meany was morally opposed to racism.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June, the Duke met for {{the first}} time the President of the Imperial War Council, Prince Eugene – {{accompanied}} by Count Wratislaw – at the village of Mundelsheim, halfway between the Danube and the Rhine. By 13 June, the Imperial Field Commander, Prince Louis of Baden, had joined them in Großheppach. The three generals commanded a force of nearly 110,000 men. At conference it was decided that Eugene would return with 28,000 men to the Lines of Stollhofen on the Rhine to keep an eye on Villeroi and Tallard and prevent them going to the aid of the Franco-Bavarian army on the Danube. Meanwhile, Marlborough's and Baden's forces would combine, totalling 80,000 men, for <b>the</b> <b>march</b> <b>on</b> the Danube to seek out the Elector and Marsin before they could be reinforced.|$|E
5|$|The Women's March on Versailles, {{also known}} as The October March, The October Days, or simply <b>The</b> <b>March</b> <b>on</b> Versailles, {{was one of the}} {{earliest}} and most significant events of the French Revolution. The march began among women in the marketplaces of Paris who, on the morning of 5 October 1789, were near rioting over the high price and scarcity of bread. Their demonstrations quickly became intertwined with the activities of revolutionaries, who were seeking liberal political reforms and a constitutional monarchy for France. The market women and their various allies grew into a mob of thousands. Encouraged by revolutionary agitators, they ransacked the city armory for weapons and marched to the Palace of Versailles. The crowd besieged the palace, and in a dramatic and violent confrontation, they successfully pressed their demands upon King Louis XVI. The next day, the crowd compelled the king, his family, and most of the French Assembly to return with them to Paris.|$|E

5|$|Ibrahim {{moved to}} secure control of Iraq region, but {{although}} he captured Kufa, Hasan ibn Sahl, {{who had made}} Wasit his base of operations, managed to get to Basra first. However, the governor of Egypt, Abd al-Aziz al-Azdi, recognized Ibrahim as Caliph. In Khurasan, the Sahlids at first downplayed the events at Baghdad, falsely informing al-Ma'mun that Ibrahim had merely been declared governor (amir) rather than Caliph. Finally, in December 817 Ali al-Rida succeeded in revealing to al-Ma'mun the real situation in Iraq, and convinced him that the turmoil in the Caliphate was far greater than the Sahlids presented it to be, and that a reconciliation with Baghdad was necessary. Al-Ma'mun now resolved to assume personal control of his empire, and on 22 January 818 he left Marv and began a very slow journey west to Baghdad. Fadl ibn Sahl was murdered on 13 February, probably on al-Ma'mun's orders, although {{the rest of his}} family was spared a persecution like that which had befallen the Barmakids. Indeed, Hasan ibn Sahl was for the time being confirmed in his brother's position, and al-Ma'mun was betrothed to one of his daughters. Ali al-Rida also died during <b>the</b> <b>march</b> <b>on</b> 5 September, possibly of poison. His burial place at Sanabad, now known as Mashhad ("the place of martyrdom"), was to become a major Shi'a pilgrimage site.|$|E
5|$|While visiting Ghana in 1960, Du Bois {{spoke with}} its {{president}} about {{the creation of}} a new encyclopedia of the African diaspora, the Encyclopedia Africana. In early 1961, Ghana notified Du Bois that they had appropriated funds to support the encyclopedia project, and they invited Du Bois to come to Ghana and manage the project there. In October 1961, at the age of 93, Du Bois and his wife traveled to Ghana to take up residence and commence work on the encyclopedia. In early 1963, the United States refused to renew his passport, so he made the symbolic gesture of becoming a citizen of Ghana. While it is sometimes stated that he renounced his U.S. citizenship at that time, and he did state his intention to do so, Du Bois never actually did. His health declined during the two years he was in Ghana, and he died on August 27, 1963, in the capital of Accra at the age of 95. Du Bois was buried in Accra near his home, which is now the Du Bois Memorial Centre. A day after his death, at <b>the</b> <b>March</b> <b>on</b> Washington, speaker Roy Wilkins asked the hundreds of thousands of marchers to honor Du Bois with a moment of silence. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, embodying many of the reforms Du Bois had campaigned for his entire life, was enacted almost a year after his death.|$|E
