500|$|Post-release reviews {{were also}} positive. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the miniseries an [...] "A" [...] and wrote that it [...] "can {{be seen as}} a summary of Adventure Times growth over seven seasons, {{beginning}} with smaller, sillier tales that build to something much deeper." [...] He applauded how Islands [...] "does fantastic work fleshing out supporting characters", specifically highlighting the show's nuanced and multidimensional portrayal of Martin, Dr. Gross, and Susan Strong. He wrote that the miniseries' main story is [...] "a powerful <b>thesis</b> <b>statement</b> cementing the show's overall message that adventure {{is at the core of}} personal discovery and fulfillment", and that this same story is [...] "extremely relevant to the United States' current socio-political climate". Dave Trumbore of Collider.com wrote that the string of episodes were [...] "packed full of emotional resonance and deeply complex character relationships" [...] and [...] "dip into some emotionally difficult territory". Trumbore was particularly complimentary towards the way the show managed to explicate Susan's character by giving her a compelling backstory. Ultimately, Trumbore wrote that while [...] "Adventure Time: Islands succeeds in every aspect the series has become known for," [...] it also [...] "comes up short in familiar ways... Unfortunately, the style (and the duration) of Adventure Time episodes works against... delving into [...] mythology... so we'll just have to obsess over whatever glimpses we get and settle for watching this series again and again." ...|$|E

However, {{for a variety of reasons}} these skills are not always as well developed as they might be - both during and upon completion of college.

The assignment was piloted in a mid-level social psychology class. Pre-test/post-test comparisons indicate substantial improvement in students’ ability to identify <b>thesis</b> <b>statements,</b> recognize and interpret evidence, and other critical reading skills. Furthermore, students themselves rate the assignment as efficacious in helping them with both their reading and writing skills. </span...|$|R

5000|$|The {{defining}} {{features of}} a [...] "cause and effect" [...] essay are causal chains that connect from a cause to an effect, careful language, and chronological or emphatic order.

40|$|In this essay, I {{reflect on}} the {{teaching}} experiment that I did several years ago in my class on transatlantic short stories and novels of the nineteenth century. As instructors of literature in a university setting, we often face {{the question of how}} to teach undergraduate students what a researched argument is and how to help them come up with effective <b>thesis</b> <b>statements.</b> The number of students, their different educational backgrounds, skills, and motivations can all be a challenge for instructors who need to make sure that everyone enrolled in the class understands the complex processes of research and argumentative writing before starting the draft. Our major concern, however, is how to keep students fully engaged in the processes of exploration, research, and drafting. Here I share my experience of teaching these processes in two 75 -minute sessions. I include the methods of teaching and the homework and in-class prompts assigned to the class. I used the model similar to the one that Ashley M. Walter proposed in her thesis, which consists of discussion, providing students with a frame/stance, and transmediation. To this model, I added a mini-session on the in-class exploration of our library’s databases and brainstorming <b>thesis</b> <b>statements.</b> I chose Henry James’s brief and witty novel The Reverberator (1888) for the purposes of this process, mainly because this text has been neglected in the criticism on James’s late work, and I wanted to see what kinds of arguments my students would come up with to recover it...|$|R
30|$|Whether {{holistic}} rating or analytic {{rating scales}} are used, {{in the assessment}} of writing the organization of ideas (sometimes called essay structure) is invariably taken into account. Likewise, in evaluation of writing by classroom teachers organization of ideas is often highly valued. However, the concept of organization is very broad (Cummings et al. 2001; Freedman, 1979). What constitutes effective organization seems to vary widely between teachers, institutions and geographical areas. There are many different rhetorical features that can be taken into account. Some in the field of language education may look for the presence of <b>thesis</b> <b>statements</b> and topic sentences (MacIntyre, 2007), while others may focus more on paragraphing, cohesive devices or coherence (Erdosy, 2004), for example.|$|R
