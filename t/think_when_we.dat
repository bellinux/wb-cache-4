500|$|Most of {{the songs}} on Slap-Happy were {{recorded}} before the band decided to form Wax Tadpole. Sparks and Gardner wrote all the songs, usually at Gardner's home, even though the whole group contributed to the album {{in one form or}} another. Unlike its predecessor, Slap-Happy was made with a low budget. According to Sparks, [...] "We utilized a lot of home studios, did a lot of our tracking ourselves, used a lot of first takes. I think there's a lot of life in this record, and yet I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> started our own label we were fearing having to take a major step down in production because of the financial aspects." [...] The album was produced by Brian Haught, a friend of the band who let the band use his studio [...] "just out of the kindness of his heart." [...] It was recorded and mixed at Synical Labs, PCS Studios, Sound City, de Prume Studios, Sonors Studios, and King Sound and Pictures in Los Angeles. Audio mastering took place at Precision Mastering in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} four guest artists; Rakim {{from the}} hip hop duo Eric B. & Rakim on [...] "Guilty All the Same", Page Hamilton from the American alternative metal band Helmet on [...] "All for Nothing", Daron Malakian from System of a Down for the song [...] "Rebellion" [...] and Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine fame on the song [...] "Drawbar". Bennington commented on the collaborations, stating that [...] "We really felt like {{if we need to}} be inspired and move in another direction. I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> got Page in, Mike had written this chorus and sang it, and his voice had this tone, and it was unlike anything I'd heard from him before. And I was like, [...] "Dude this is crazy, this sounds like a Helmet song! It's cool!" [...] And we were like, [...] "Dude, why don't we {{see if we can get}} like Page in here?" [...] You know? And if that's why the song says it's feeling like it should be, then why don't we just go straight to the source".|$|E
500|$|Austin in turn penned [...] "Creep" [...] {{and thought}} she would be its perfect lead. He wrote the song while {{cruising}} in a Chevrolet Blazer and {{wanted it to be}} written from a female perspective. This experience was said to create [...] "a new mold" [...] of songwriting for him, as he was [...] "talking about stuff guys didn't know girls did." [...] The [...] "female point-of-view" [...] on the track was something the trio appreciated because as a group they have always portrayed themselves as feminists, the song goes along with that mentality. But still, on the 2013 VH1 biopic , the track also appeared to have been also inspired by Austin's infidelity to then-girlfriend, member Rozonda [...] "Chilli" [...] Thomas. Latoya Peterson of Spin observed that feminism was being loudly maligned in music {{at the time of the}} song's release, as a result, more female artists like TLC, Salt-N-Pepa and Tori Amos began to [...] "overtly defend themselves." [...] When asked if they were getting inspired from Radiohead's 1992 track with the same name, the group denied this. Andy Greene from Rolling Stone had pointed out that the group took the term [...] "" [...] in a different direction compared to Radiohead's or Stone Temple Pilots' 1993 single's, in which the trio's song is about getting revenge on a cheating guy by having an affair. The idea, however, was considered to be quite [...] "controversial." [...] According to Thomas, the theme didn't come as much of a shock for them, she stated: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> first came out, it was very bold of us to have a song called 'Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg' with [...] 'Two inches or a yard, rock hard or if it's sagging'. People totally understood what type of group we were. To sing a song like 'Creep' wouldn't be surprising from us." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early 2012, {{the band}} {{announced}} {{shows in the}} United States and Europe, titled the Up Close and Personal Tour. The shows themselves varied considerably {{in comparison to the}} previous Chinese Democracy Tour. All of the North American shows took place in smaller-scale clubs, rather than a large arena or stadium. All pyrotechnics were removed from the shows. The European leg of the tour began approximately one month after the band's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Guitarist DJ Ashba discussed a potential follow up to Chinese Democracy in a 2012 interview, stating [...] "I've written and demoed up probably about 12 songs, I think. And some of them [...] has heard, some of them he hasn't yet. But I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> get {{a little bit of time}} off, we're gonna hopefully all get together and piece together what we think is gonna be the next best thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with a What's on TV journalist, Morey said viewers relate to Sonya because she is [...] "pretty normal". The actress noted that Sonya is not glamorous and there is [...] "something quite humbling about her." [...] Morey {{went on to say that}} Sonya's heart is usually in the right place and she always tries to do the right thing for the right reasons. Of her character's development, Morey explained [...] "She has become a lot more self-assured and she has learnt to trust herself again. I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> first met her, she was quite closed off and didn't want to let anyone in fear of hurting them." [...] Sonya decides to give up her job as a guide dog trainer to buy and turn the community garden into a garden nursery. Morey told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap that she thought that the garden was symbolic of what Sonya is doing in her personal life. She explained [...] "She made a lot of mistakes when she was younger. Now she just wants to plant beautiful things and watch them grow. She's very focused on that for now." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do you know, Robert, I {{have been}} {{thinking}} {{so much about the}} future, and I <b>think</b> that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> come back from our travels we ought to put aside almost all our money to do good with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, {{it is not}} {{so lonely}} here as you will <b>think</b> it <b>when</b> <b>we</b> arrive at our destination," [...] she replied. [...] "There are houses here, but they are hidden by the trees. There are no houses near us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Grand!" [...] Bill agreed. [...] "But I didn't <b>think</b> so <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were in {{the middle}} of that fog {{listening}} to them whistles and trying to find out the way. I didn't say much, George, but I felt downright funky." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Prayers, Chub," [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "are more {{in our hearts}} than in our hands. It isn't what we do that counts; it's what we feel. But the most that bothers me is what the folks at home will <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> don't come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She was killed, Master," [...] Zaki said sorrowfully. [...] "I thought {{possibly}} {{it would}} be so. The Dervishes did not carry off old women. They killed them, and the little children. I had never hoped to see her again; but I did <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> entered Omdurman, that my sisters might be here." ...|$|E
60|$|And she did {{sleep until}} {{we reached the}} city. It was about seven o'clock in the morning, I <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> began to steam slowly by the wharves and piers.

60|$|Won't {{somebody}} lend {{the young}} gentleman from Cambridge {{a small and}} healthy child just {{for a week or}} so, and let the bargain be that he lives with it all the time? The young gentleman from Cambridge <b>thinks,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> call up the stairs to say that if we hear another sound from the nursery during the next two hours we will come up and do things to that Child the mere thought of which should appal it, that is silencing the Child. It does not occur to him that two minutes later that Child is yelling again at the top of its voice, having forgotten all we ever said.|$|R
60|$|MRS. B.--I'm {{surprised}} that noblemen HAVE grooms in their chambers. I should {{think they were}} much better in the stables. I am sure I always <b>think</b> so <b>when</b> <b>we</b> dine with Doctor Clinker. His man does bring such a smell of the stable with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} a great {{pleasure}} to me to meet you. I do not remember anybody with whom I have found myself in so much sympathy--except one of course. It is strange to <b>think</b> that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> meet again I shall be a married woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|Do we ever <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> walk those busy, bustling streets, all {{alive with}} Christmas shoppers, and {{mingle with the}} rushing tides that throng and jostle through the stores, that unseen spirits may be hastening to and fro along those same ways bearing Christ's Christmas gifts to men-- gifts whose value no earthly gold or gems can represent? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{good of you}} to say so, Colonel," [...] Macwitty said; [...] "but at any rate, it {{has been}} a rare bit of luck for us, and little did we <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were ordered to {{accompany}} you it was going to lead to our getting commissions. Well, we will do our best to deserve them." ...|$|E

The other, in thinking about Europe and European, there is 'One and only God' at any time, I <b>think.</b> So, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> about the modernization of Japan, {{we have to think about}} the conflict between 'Tennou' and 'God' usually...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> so. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> {{found her}} address among the truck Strange had {{left with the}} foreman, it was the proper {{thing for me to}} tell her he was drowned.

6000|$|... "It is monstrous, it is inhuman!" [...] Terence exclaimed, in Portuguese. [...] "Thus {{to seize}} {{harmless}} fishermen, who have so narrowly escaped drowning; {{the sea is}} less cruel than these men. They have taken our boat, too, our dear good boat. What will our mothers <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> do not return? That we have been {{swallowed up by the}} sea. How they will watch for us, but in vain!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In that too, certainly. Neither Captain Daggett nor myself will be {{disposed}} to dispute {{either of these}} two propositions, I <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> come to reflect on them. A day of rest {{would seem to be}} appointed by nature; and I make no doubt we have filled up all the sooner for having observed one. Seamen have so many calls on their time which cannot be neglected, that it is unwise in them to increase the number unnecessarily." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, pray begin, Grandfather," [...] said Laurence, [...] "for I <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> {{talk about}} old times, {{it should be}} in the early evening, before the candles are lighted. The shapes of the famous persons who once sat in the chair will be more apt to come back, and be seen among us, in this glimmer and {{pleasant}} gloom, than they would in the vulgar daylight. And, besides, we can make pictures of all that you tell us among the glowing embers and white ashes." ...|$|E

6000|$|ANN. [with simple earnestness] Yes, I will come, Jack, {{since you}} wish it. You are my guardian; and {{think we ought}} to see more of one another and come to know one another better. [Gratefully] It's very {{thoughtful}} and very kind of you, Jack, to offer me this lovely holiday, especially after what I said about Rhoda. You really are good--much better than you <b>think.</b> <b>When</b> do <b>we</b> start? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Greta, {{tracing the}} pattern of the {{sunlight}} on her skirt. [...] "But I <b>think</b> that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> hope, we are not brave, because we are expecting something for ourselves. Chris says that hope is prayer, and if it is prayer, then all the time we are hoping, we are asking for something, and it is not brave to ask for things." ...|$|R
6000|$|Every one who {{reflects}} {{will admit}} that it is pleasant to <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> retire to rest, that a splendid system of police renders our home a place of safety, and that, although there are villains more than enough who would {{do their best to}} get at our purses and plate, we need not make ourselves uneasy so long as the stout guardians of the night are on the beat. Do we not congratulate ourselves on this? and do we not pay the police-tax without grumbling, or at least with less grumbling than we vent when paying other taxes? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, pussy," [...] she said, on one {{of these}} {{occasions}} when they chanced to be alone together, [...] "little did you and I <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> used to be sitting so comfortably here, that our darlings were being tossed about and starved in open boats on the stormy sea! Ah! pussy, pussy, we little knew--but `it's all well that ends well,' as a great writer that you know nothing about has said, and you and I can never, never be thankful enough for getting back, safe and sound, our dear old man, and our darling boys, and our--our little Pauline, the Island Queen." ...|$|E
60|$|Rachel's {{cheeks and}} {{forehead}} were now suffused with red. We used to <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> pretended {{to read the}} faces of our neighbours, that a rising blush betrayed a conscious falsehood. For the most part we know better now, and have learned to decipher more accurately the outward signs which are given by the impulses of the heart. An unmerited accusation of untruth will ever bring the blood to {{the face of the}} young and innocent. But Mrs. Ray was among the ignorant in this matter, and she groaned inwardly when she saw her child's confusion.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, Kirk {{stated that}} he was not opposed to the {{immigration}} process in the United States discriminating against young Arab males from [...] "terrorist-producing states". He stated, [...] "I <b>think</b> that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> look at the threat that’s out there, young men between, say, the ages of 18 and 25 from a couple of countries, I believe a certain amount of intense scrutiny should be placed on them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} happy together, at least," [...] I said; [...] "no future misery can deprive us of the past.
