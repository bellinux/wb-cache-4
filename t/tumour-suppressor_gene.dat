50|$|The PiggyBac (PB) {{transposon}} {{from the}} cabbage looper moth Trichoplusia ni was engineered {{to be highly}} active in mammalian cells, and is capable of genome-wide mutagenesis. Transposons contained both PB and Sleeping Beauty inverted repeats, {{in order to be}} recognized by both transposases and increase the frequency of transposition. In addition, the transposon contained promoter and enhancer elements, a splice donor and acceptors to allow gain- or loss-of-function mutations depending on the transposon's orientation, and bidirectional polyadenylation signals. The transposons were transformed into mouse cells in vitro and mutants containing tumours were analyzed. The mechanism of the mutation leading to tumour formation determined if the gene was classified as an oncogene or a <b>tumour-suppressor</b> <b>gene.</b> Oncogenes tended to be characterized by insertions in regions leading to overexpression of a gene, whereas tumour-suppressor genes were classified as such based on loss-of-function mutations.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based analysis of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is a powerful method for detecting regions of altered <b>tumour-suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> Focusing on chromosome 12, we examined 23 ovarian cancer samples for LOH using 31 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers and found the chromosomal localization of two putative <b>tumour-suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> Two commonly deleted regions were 12 p 12. 3 - 13. 1 in 6 / 23 (26 %) and 12 q 23 -ter in 7 / 23 (30 %) samples. LOH on chromosome 12 was more common in late-stage ovarian carcinomas. The region of LOH at 12 p 12. 3 - 13. 1 includes the genes that code for the ETS-family transcriptional factor, known as TEL, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, known as p 27 Kip 1. Mutational analysis of both TEL and p 27 Kip 1 using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) showed no abnormalities, suggesting that the altered gene in this region is neither of these genes. Taken together, our data suggest that new <b>tumour-suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> {{in the region of}} chromosomes 12 p 12. 3 - 13. 1 and 12 q 23 -ter may be involved in the development of ovarian cancer...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to better our understanding of the carcinogenesis of gestational trophoblastic tumours and to investigate the possible presence of mutational alteration of the p 53 <b>tumour-suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> in these tumours. Amplification-based direct DNA sequencing was performed on 14 hydatidiform moles, six invasive moles, eight choriocarcinomas and ten normal early placental tissues. No mutation in exons 5 - 8 was detected in any of these 38 tissue specimens. These results suggest that a mutation in p 53 tumour suppressor either does not exist or is a very rare event in gestational trophoblastic tumours.

40|$|The SMAD- 2 gene, {{which is}} located at 18 q 21, has been {{identified}} as a candidate <b>tumour-suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> from work on colorectal cancers. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the clinical alterations and the significance of its mutations in a series of colorectal cancers previously examined for SMAD- 4 /DPC- 4 gene. Mutation analyses of the SMAD- 2 gene were carried out on cDNA samples from 36 primary colorectal cancer specimens using a combination of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing. Only one missense mutation (2. 8 %), producing an amino acid substitution in the highly conserved region, and two homozygous deletions (5. 5 %) of the total coding region of the SMAD- 2 gene were detected in the 36 cancers. The SMAD- 2 gene may play a role as a candidate <b>tumour-suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> in a small fraction of colorectal cancers. However, allelic loss at 18 q 21 is very often seen in this type of tumour. Even in combination with changes in SMAD- 4, the observed frequency was not sufficient to account for all 18 q 21 deletions in colorectal cancers.

40|$|Allelic {{losses on}} {{chromosome}} 16 q in tumour cells are frequent {{in a variety}} of malignancies, suggesting the presence of one or more <b>tumour-suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> in the region. Among 210 sporadic breast cancers we examined using 15 microsatellite markers on the long arm of chromosome 16, heterozygosity for at least one locus was lost in 141 (67 %). Detailed deletion mapping revealed two distinct commonly deleted regions. One region was defined as a 3 -cM interval flanked by markers D 16 S 512 and D 16 S 515 at 16 q 22; the second consisted of a 9. 5 -cM interval flanked by markers D 16 S 498 and D 16 S 303 at q 24. 3. Allelic loss on 16 q was observed frequently in small tumours, tumours without lymph node metastasis and tumours of the non-invasive histological type as well as in tumours of more advanced phenotype, suggesting that inactivation of one of at least two <b>tumour-suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> on 16 q plays a role in early stage breast carcinogenesis...|$|R

The increase in induced at a pretranscriptional level and is apparently specific to brain tumours of neuroepithelial origin. Approximately 30 % of grade IV tumours display low levels of MnSOD content, and preoperative radiotherapy and brachytherapy result in low amounts of enzyme.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the likely chromosomal locations of <b>tumour-suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> related to Epstein-Barr virus-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Fifty-six microsatellite polymorphic markers located on every autosomal arm were used to estimate the incidence of loss of heterozygosity in 27 Epstein-Barr virus-associated nasopharyngeal carcinomas. High frequencies of allelic loss were observed on chromosome 3 p (75. 0 %) and 9 p (87. 0 %). Chromosome 9 q, 11 q, 13 q and 14 q displayed loss in over 50 %, while chromosome 3 q, 6 p, 16 q, 19 q and 22 q exhibited loss in 35 - 50 %. Furthermore, several other chromosomal arms demonstrated allelic loss in 20 - 35 %. Additionally, 1 of the 27 cases showed microsatellite instability at multiple loci. These findings provide evidence of multiple genetic alterations during cancer development and clues for further studies of <b>tumour-suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> in Epstein-Barr virus-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma...|$|R

40|$|Epigenetic gene {{silencing}} {{is an important}} mechanism in the initiation and progression of cancer. Abnormal DNA CpG island hypermethylation and histone modifications are involved in aberrant silencing of <b>tumour-suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> LSD 1 (lysine-specific demethylase 1) was the first enzyme identified to specifically demethylate H 3 K 4 (Lys 4 of histone H 3). Methylated H 3 K 4 is an important mark associated with transcriptional activation. The flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding amine oxidase domain of LSD 1 is homologous with two polyamine oxidases, SMO (spermine oxidase) and APAO (N 1 -acetylpolyamine oxidase). We have demonstrated previously that long-chain polyamine analogues, the oligoamines, are inhibitors of LSD 1. In the present paper we report the synergistic effects of specific oligoamines in combination with DFMO (2 -difluoromethylornithine), an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, in human colorectal cancer cells. DFMO treatment depletes natural polyamines and increases the uptake of exogenous polyamines. The combination of oligoamines and DFMO results in a synergistic re-expression of aberrantly silenced <b>tumour-suppressor</b> <b>genes,</b> including SFRP 2 (secreted frizzled-related protein 2), which encodes a Wnt signalling pathway antagonist and plays an anti-tumorigenic role in colorectal cancer. The treatment-induced re-expression of SFRP 2 is associated with increased H 3 K 4 me 2 (di-methyl H 3 K 4) in the gene promoter.
