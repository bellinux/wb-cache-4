5|$|Annis's brother, Sir Geoffrey Wychwood, hears rumours of her {{developing}} {{relationship with}} Carleton and sends {{his wife and}} children to Bath to discourage Carleton. Soon after their arrival members of the household contract influenza, and Annis nurses them until she too becomes infected. When Carleton hears that Annis is seriously ill he returns to Bath, arriving on the first day that she is able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed.</b> Annis agrees to marry Carleton, despite the objections of her brother.|$|E
5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Kaganovich {{arrived in}} Kiev, Khrushchev fell ill, and was barely seen until September 1947. In his memoirs, Khrushchev {{indicates}} he had pneumonia; some biographers have theorized that Khrushchev's illness was entirely political, {{out of fear}} that his loss of position was the first step towards downfall and demise. However, Khrushchev's children remembered their father as having been seriously ill. Once Khrushchev was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed,</b> he and his family took their first vacation since before the war, to a beachfront resort in Latvia. Khrushchev, though, soon broke the beach routine with duck-hunting trips, and a visit to newly Soviet Kaliningrad, where he toured factories and quarries. By the end of 1947, Kaganovich had been recalled to Moscow and the recovered Khrushchev had been restored to the First Secretaryship. He then resigned the Ukrainian premiership in favor of Demyan Korotchenko, Khrushchev's protégé.|$|E

5|$|The Canadiens' team doctor, Dr. J.A. Hector Forgues, visited Morenz in late February and {{determined}} that he had suffered a nervous breakdown. To help Morenz, Dr. Forgues banned all visitors to his room, except for family and Canadiens officials. Mary, Morenz's wife, and their oldest son, Howie Jr., visited on most days, and William Morenz, his father, travelled from Stratford {{during the first week}} of March and stayed through March 5. On March 8, Morenz began complaining of chest pains, which doctors attributed to a heart attack. Mary Morenz and Cecil Hart were called to the hospital; around 11:30pm, Morenz tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> to use the washroom but collapsed on the floor and died from a coronary embolism caused by blood clots from his damaged leg, minutes before his wife and coach arrived. He was 34.|$|E
25|$|On 21 December 2003, the Congregation certified, on {{the basis}} of three expert medical opinions, that a miracle in 1960 {{occurred}} through the intercession of Charles.

25|$|In 1964, Israeli {{physician}} Jacob Sheskin administered thalidomide to {{a patient}} critically ill with leprosy. The patient exhibited erythema nodosum leprosum(ENL), a painful skin condition, one of the complications of leprosy. This was attempted despite the ban on thalidomide's use, but results were favourable: the patient slept for hours and was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> without aid upon awakening. A clinical trial studying the use of thalidomide in leprosy soon followed.|$|E

Summer explains that Tom was right about true love existing; he was just wrong about it being with her. She says she got married because she felt sure about her husband, something she wasn't with Tom. Summer puts her hand on Tom's and says she is glad to see he is doing well. As she leaves, Tom tells her he really hopes she is happy.|$|E
25|$|Nowell {{was married}} to Troy Dendekker on May 18, 1996. Seven days later, {{on the morning of}} May 25, Sublime was {{supposed}} to begin a five-day tour through Northern California, followed by a European and East Coast tour. However, while the band was staying at the Ocean View Motel in San Francisco, drummer Bud Gaugh woke up to find Nowell lying {{on the floor next to}} his bed. His dalmatian, Lou Dog, was curled up on the bed whimpering. Bradley had tried waking up his fellow band-mates to go to the beach with him that morning, but they were too hung-over and tired <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed.</b> Initially, Gaugh assumed Nowell was too intoxicated to get into bed; however, he noticed a green film around his mouth, and it became apparent he had overdosed on heroin. Gaugh called for paramedics, but Nowell had died several hours earlier, and was pronounced dead at the scene. Nowell was cremated and his ashes were spread over his favorite surfing spot in Surfside, California. A headstone was placed at Westminster Memorial in Westminster, California in his memory.|$|E

25|$|According to Krakauer, a well-nourished {{person might}} consume {{the seeds and}} survive because the body can use its stores of glucose and amino acids to rid itself of the poison. Since McCandless lived on a diet of rice, lean meat, and wild plants and had less than 10% body fat when he died, Krakauer {{hypothesized}} that McCandless was likely unable {{to fend off the}} toxins. However, when the Eskimo potatoes from the area around the bus were later tested in a laboratory of the University of Alaska Fairbanks by Dr. Thomas Clausen, toxins were not found. Krakauer later modified his hypothesis, suggesting that mold of the variety Rhizoctonia leguminicola may have caused McCandless's death. Rhizoctonia leguminicola is known to cause digestion problems in livestock, and may have aided McCandless's impending starvation. Krakauer hypothesised that the bag in which Chris kept the potato seeds was damp and the seeds thus became moldy. If McCandless had eaten seeds that contained this mold, he could have become sick, and Krakauer suggests that he thus became unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> and so starved. His basis for the mold hypothesis is a photograph that shows seeds in a bag. Following chemical analysis of the seeds, Krakauer now believes that the seeds themselves are poisonous.|$|E
500|$|As a young teenager, Tatiana was {{assigned}} a regiment of soldiers, the Vosnesensky (Ascenscion) Hussars and given the rank of honorary colonel. She and Olga, who was also given her own regiment, {{would go out and}} inspect the soldiers regularly, an occasion they greatly enjoyed. When she was nearly fourteen, an ill Tatiana begged her mother to permit her <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> in time to go to a review so she could watch a soldier she was infatuated with. [...] "I would like so much to go the review of the second division as I am also the second daughter and Olga was at the first so now it is my turn," [...] she wrote to Alexandra on 20 April 1911. [...] "...Yes, Mama, and at the second division I will see whom I must see ... you know whom ..." ...|$|E
500|$|Observers {{regularly}} noted {{incidents of}} marital discord between Anne and James. The so-called Gowrie conspiracy of 1600, {{in which the}} young Earl of Gowrie, John Ruthven, and his brother Alexander Ruthven were killed by James' attendants for a supposed assault on the King, triggered the dismissal of their sisters Beatrix and Barbara Ruthven as ladies-in-waiting to Anne, with whom they were [...] "in chiefest credit." [...] The Queen, who was five months pregnant, refused <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> unless they were reinstated and stayed there for two days, also refusing to eat. When James tried to command her, she warned him to take care how he treated {{her because she was}} not the Earl of Gowrie. James placated her for the moment by paying a famous acrobat to entertain her, but she never gave up, and her stubborn support for the Ruthvens {{over the next three years}} was taken seriously enough by the government to be regarded as a security issue. In 1602, after discovering that Anne had smuggled Beatrix Ruthven into Holyrood, James carried out a cross-examination of the entire household; in 1603, he finally decided to grant Beatrix Ruthven a pension of £200.|$|E

500|$|... "Clown"'s concept {{deals with}} an {{incident}} that happened in San Diego, California. A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake up in the morning and do a line <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed.</b> Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's about when you do meth and you look down at your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens when you do too much drugs and your girl wanna get with you and you got some man problems down below.

500|$|The children's book The World's Angriest Boy in the World, {{which appears}} in Haller's {{memories}} of his childhood, was written by Hawley and published {{for use in the}} show. Stevens described it as [...] "the world's most twisted children's book", but useful for him to hold and read while acting. The physical manifestation of the book's title character was inspired by Edward Gorey drawings, with Wylie explaining that he [...] "loved the idea of him wearing a little velvet, Eddie Munster child’s funeral suit. That’s where that dude came from. He’s really scary." [...] Another manifestation of the Shadow King, the Devil with the Yellow Eyes, was inspired by the reality television series My 600-lb Life, with Wylie explaining, [...] "They do this amazing thing at the beginning of every episode of that show where they show the person struggling <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> or walk down a hallway ... They light it badly just to make the person’s journey seem that much more difficult." [...] Boisclair was cast in the role due to his [...] height and slender frame, with prosthetics used to give him a [...] "gigantic body with no neck [...] really skinny arms and legs". Boisclair was called a [...] "rare and lucky find", akin to Bolaji Badejo, who portrayed the alien in the 1979 film Alien. Boisclair's prosthetics were designed by Sarah Pickersgill, under special effects makeup head Todd Masters, and took four-and-a-half hours to apply. Masters' team were also responsible for creating the body parts that are found sticking out of walls in the pilot, including Lenny's upper body and arm, produced from a silicone copy of Plaza; extensive bruising for Cary and Kerry Loudermilk after a major fight sequence, which was achieved with Pros-Aide transfers that were reduced each day to show the wounds healing; and the burn makeup for Linklater after he is injured in the pilot, which was designed to cover half his face and most of his chest and back, with just the face and neck requiring five separate prosthetics. Marcine Peter at Contour Contact Lens provided hand-painted contact lenses for the production, including for Boisclair to wear as the Devil with the Yellow Eyes.|$|E
