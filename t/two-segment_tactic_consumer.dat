We address this gap by quantitatively investigating the role of consumers social attitudes and their response to social message advertisements. Results indicate that some socially conscious consumers are generally leery of advertising and this can extend to CSR <b>tactics.</b> A <b>consumers</b> general attitude towards advertising mediates the relationship between their pro-social viewpoints and their attitude towards the brand, and this process is moderated by the content of the advertisement (i. e.

This has distinct implications for managers, as it becomes more important for them to understand the pro-social attitudes of the audience before investing in CSR focused advertising...|$|R

40|$|Ecological {{models of}} {{behaviour}} are typically {{based on the}} assumption that decisions can be evaluated with a single resource currency. Here we present models that predict the <b>tactics</b> of <b>consumers</b> collecting two nutritionally distinct resources: fuel that is used for activity and food used for growth (F 4 G). Both models assume that foragers seek to maximize F 4 G gain subject to collecting enough fuel for activity. Our first model determines the optimal tempos of foraging for each resource. While foraging for fuel, consumers use and collect the same resource and optimal behaviour is identical to the predictions of a single resource model. However, because consumers use fuel to acquire F 4 G, they are predicted to work harder to acquire F 4 G when fuel is more available. Our second model examines how consumers should allocate their time among foraging for fuel, foraging for F 4 G and defence of F 4 G sources. Optimal investment in defence increases when fuel is available (because expenditures can be quickly recovered) and when F 4 G is scarce (because fewer opportunities exist for obtaining new sources of F 4 G). Our results suggest that behaviours will appear wasteful when foraging environments are fuel-rich and overly frugal when F 4 G is common but fuel is scarce...|$|R

40|$|Mohun, Arwen P. Daniel, PeteOnce {{primarily}} a Victorian parlor instrument, the acoustic guitar {{emerged in the}} twentieth century as a key component of almost every major genre of popular American music. How did this happen? The path to ubiquity involved manufacturers, cultural movements, networks of mass communication, and musicians. These factors combined to gradually transform the design, construction, dissemination, and use of the instrument in American musical culture. Makers employed new methods of mass-producing instruments to lower costs and improve the guitar's intrinsic qualities. They also utilized the strategy of "aspirational marketing. " This <b>tactic</b> enticed <b>consumers</b> to purchase a guitar not simply as a music-making device, but rather as an object that could virtually transport a listener to faraway destinations or possibly serve as the ticket to gaining fame and fortune alongside the celebrities of mass media. The story of the popularization of the acoustic guitar is inextricably tied to periods of heightened American cultural interest in two other members of the fretted stringed instrument family: the mandolin and ukulele. Ultimately, this process culminated {{in a wide range of}} instruments from flimsy plywood guitars decorated with cowboy imagery to durable "Space Age" instruments like the Ovation guitars endorsed by recording artists.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{cross-cultural}} comparison of Chinese and American hospitality customers who report critical incidents and the resulting influences that these incidents and recovery efforts had on behavior. Recognizing that hospitality-based organizations are increasingly operating internationally, the study provides insights for managing customer relationships. Design/methodology/approach - The study utilizes the critical incident technique in conjunction with a structured self-administered questionnaire. The sampling approach resulted in 1, 146 usable responses. Findings - The results demonstrate statistically significant cultural differences between American and Chinese consumers in terms of reported critical incident types, recovery approaches, and post-incident private voice, public voice, and repurchase intention. Research limitations/implications - This research uses cultural value scores for China and the USA as a way to explain and discuss the findings. Hofstede's model was not tested and the provided explanations should be viewed with caution.

40|$|While the 2011 Egyptian Uprising renewed {{attention}} to revolutionary news platforms such as Al-Jazeera and Facebook, citizens {{continued to be}} understudied as active consumers of information. Yet citizens’ perceptions of their informational milieu and how they responded in consuming, processing, and interpreting facts offer crucial insight into the turbulent transition that followed the initial uprising. This study analyzes Egyptian citizens’ accounts of their information environment and practices amid socio-political change. Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 31 politically-engaged citizens from various political and professional backgrounds. Participants were asked to discuss the state of public discourse, the institutions responsible for the circulation of information, and their own practices to become informed, with on-going political controversies used as case studies. The findings are presented into two parts. The first part compiles responses regarding institutions (the state, broadcast media, and social media) which were found to be functionally interconnected and interdependent, forming Egypt’s information ecosystem. This ecosystem systematically rendered information elusive, equivocal, and unreliable, but also demonstrated the importance of official information, a tolerance for partisan news, and the complementary role of social media. The second part examines citizens’ practices (the characteristics of consumers, the types of sources they relied upon, and the tactics they employed to become informed) which constituted an information culture, the information ecosystem’s counterpart. This culture was characterized by skepticism, mistrust, ingenuity, bias, and elitism, with sources being conceived as individuals and classified according to their proximity and type of knowledge; and <b>consumers</b> employing <b>tactics</b> involving the parsing of subtexts and the juxtaposing of claims from multiple texts. The characteristics, sources, and <b>tactics</b> of <b>consumers</b> reflected an information culture influenced by and responding to socio-political conditions.

Besides advancing information practices research beyond traditional settings, the fieldwork was conducted in the weeks prior to the controversial overthrow of Egypt’s first elected president and therefore provides insights into a dramatic episode in the country’s transition...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach - Working with 80 children and one of their parents, this study used direct observations of child behavior in a task where they needed to regulate their emotions and a survey of parents about their child's emotional development and consumer behavior. The research used quantitative methods to test whether children's emotion regulation predicted parent reported consumer behavior (e. g. purchase requests, parent-child purchase related conflict) via multiple regression analyses. Findings - After controlling for children's age and linguistic competence, {{the study found that}} children's ability to control positively valenced emotions predicted consumer behavior. Specifically, children who had more difficulty suppressing joy/happiness were more likely to ask their parents for consumer goods and were more likely to argue with parents about these purchases. Practical implications - Content analyses of commercials targeting children have shown that many of the persuasive appeals used by advertisers are emotionally charged and often feature marketing characters that children find affectively pleasing. These findings suggest that these types of marketing appeals may overwhelm younger children which can lead to conflict with parents. Consequently, marketers and policy makers may want to re-examine the use of such <b>tactics</b> with younger <b>consumers.</b> Originality/value - While the potential link between children's emotional development and consumer behavior has been suggested in theoretical work, this is the first known study to empirically test this theorized relationship...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} critiques {{the techniques}} used to market and distribute consumer electronics {{products in the}} United States. Using the wireless networking industry as a case study, I argue that the consumer electronics industry is {{at the cutting edge}} of the commercial, consumer nature of U. S. culture and that it operates according to the ideological moorings of what the Frankfurt School called "the culture industry. " These moorings include the obscuring of contradiction and the politics of production behind a unified product image, the erasure of individual consumer choice in favor of efficient means of product distribution to an infinite consumer base, an exaggerated presentation of cultural values in product packaging that teach consumers what they should believe and how they should act, and a carefully constructed use of statistical data and quantified consumer behavior to maintain a mass, homogenized culture that opposes characterizations of diversity or heterogeneity that do not expand the consumer base or the target demographic. The rhetorical appeals of consumer electronics marketers depend upon recycled consumer values to create desire through a universal product image, through carefully designed product information, and through highly developed language. The dominant appeals in wireless networking products are to mobility, security, and entertainment. I explicate these appeals using a methodology derived from social-epistemic rhetoric, a rhetoric that examines sites of conflict and contradiction as the arbiters of culture. I explore the contradictions in what I call choicing, or the prediction and manipulation of consumer choice through the marketing, distribution, and use of mass-produced goods. These contradictions include several <b>consumer</b> <b>tactics</b> that confront choicing strategies...|$|R
5000|$|The {{basic unit}} {{in which a}} message is {{transmitted}} in culture jamming is the meme. Memes are condensed images that stimulate visual, verbal, musical, or behavioral associations that people can easily imitate and transmit to others. The term meme was coined and first popularized by geneticist Richard Dawkins, but later used by cultural critics such as Douglas Rushkoff, who claimed memes were a type of media virus. Memes are seen as genes that can jump from outlet to outlet and replicate themselves or mutate upon transmission just like a virus. Culture jammers will often use common symbols such as the McDonald's golden arches or Nike swoosh to engage people and force {{them to think about}} their eating habits or fashion sense. In one example, jammer Jonah Perreti used the Nike symbol to stir debate on sweatshop child labor and consumer freedom. Perreti made public exchanges between himself and Nike over a disagreement. Perreti had requested custom Nikes with the word [...] "sweatshop" [...] placed in the Nike symbol. Nike refused. Once this story was made public over Perreti's website, it spread worldwide and contributed to the already robust conversation and dialogue about Nike's use of sweatshops, which had been ongoing for a decade prior to Perreti's 2001 stunt. Jammers can also organize and participate in mass campaigns. Examples of cultural jamming like Perreti's are more along the lines of <b>tactics</b> that radical <b>consumer</b> social movements would use. These movements push people to question the taken-for-granted assumption that consuming is natural and good and aim to disrupt the naturalization of consumer culture; they also seek to create systems of production and consumption that are more humane and less dominated by global corporate hypercapitalism.Past mass events and ideas have included [...] "Buy Nothing Day", [...] "Digital Detox Week", virtual sit-ins and protests over the Internet, producing ‘subvertisements' and placing them in public spaces, and creating and enacting ‘placejamming' projectswhere public spaces are reclaimed and nature is re-introduced into urbanplaces.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: In {{a global}} era of growing {{consumer}} economies, retailers rely {{extensively on the}} exploitation of consumers’ personal and behavioural information, in order to successfully execute and sustain their business models and strategic objectives. The gathering and mining of consumers’ personal and behavioural information represent tremendous potential {{in the application of}} relationship marketing <b>tactics,</b> towards <b>consumer</b> intimacy, and ultimately towards competitive advantage. However, in their quest to understand consumers better, retailers need to be acutely aware of consumers’ views regarding the gathering and use of their personal and behavioural information, in order to derive the associated benefits whilst mitigating the risk of alienating consumers. To this end, the main objective of this research assignment was to understand the thoughts and feelings of a selected sample of retail consumers, regarding the use of their personal and behavioural information in relationship marketing tactics. The research aim was achieved through a qualitative exploration of the thoughts and feelings of thirty millennial retail consumers who shared their individual views in written format and small group interviews. Cognitive mapping was used as the central technique for the coding and interpretation of written and interview data, depicting the central themes of consumer rationale, as well as the causal relationships of the concepts, which influenced their sentiment and decisions. The insights produced by the cognitive mappings were triangulated using additional techniques of sentiment analysis and word frequency analysis. The combination of research techniques produced robust overarching insights of universal value, coupled with insights of specific subtleties alluding to consumer groups with differentiated engagement needs. Universal insights included strong negative sentiment whenever consumer participants considered the possibility that retailers with whom they engage {{on the basis of their}} personal information could potentially share such personal information with third-party entities outside of their explicit or implicit relationship with a particular trusted retailer. Similarly, the personally intrusive nature of telemarketing as an engagement and communication channel was met with universal disdain at every mention thereof, clearly eliminating it as a viable channel for any retailer who would seek to build and sustain trusted consumer relationships. The sample of participants revealed four broad groups of millennial consumers, each with different preferences of engagement with retailers. The majority of the participants across two groups recognised a conditional and transactional basis for exchanging varying degrees of personal information for a variety of derived benefits. A small group of participants indicated a clear preference towards avoiding engagement on a personal basis and sharing of personal information with retailers. A similarly small group of participants exhibited general openness and willingness to engage retailers and share personal and behavioural information with little restraint or concern. The insights derived from this research assignment provide a solid foundational exploration for future research on the specific and related topics, whilst the application of the cognitive mapping technique provided profound multi-dimensional insights. Businesses stand to gain potential material benefit through the careful consideration of the terms of engagement with their consumers, as provided through the universal and specific insights of this research assignment...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on {{fieldwork}} carried out in San Pablo de Lípez province, Bolivia. Through {{an examination of the}} history of the region, economic activities, ritual and oral histories, it seeks to understand the sorts of relations that have come to exist between a rural Andean group and the Bolivian nation-state and, in particular, the ways in which rural people understand themselves in the face of the state’s nation-building activities. The thesis is thus situated within the framework of studies of mestizaje, or of hybridity of peoples and cultures, and of nation-state and Indian in Latin America. The thesis proposes a model to account for the ways in which contemporary people in Sud Lípez understand themselves and others. This takes into account the historical dimension and attempts to avoid reifications of such groupings as ‘Indian’, mestizo and Spaniard, and of ethnic groups in the more abstract sense. Central to it is the concept of intertextuality, a term borrowed from linguistic theory and literary criticism that derives largely from Bakhtin’s ideas of dialogue. Intertextuality emphasises the heterogeneity of texts and the diverse elements from which they are made. The thesis is concerned primarily with discourses that surround categories of people. In contemporary Bolivia, such discourses include a current official discourse of pluralism and ethnic diversity which, it could be said, is in dialogue with ideas of homogenisation, assimilation of the Indian population, and the mestizo nation that became prominent following the National Revolution of 1952. This dialogue between contemporary discourses can be held to constitute a ‘horizontal axis’ of intertextuality. A ‘vertical axis’, which forms the context for the present-day dialogue, is in turn constituted by the discourses and dialogues surrounding categories of people throughout the colonial and early republican eras. The historical focus of the thesis allows a consideration of these past discourses. The central chapters of the thesis focus on the relation between discourse and material practices. Chapters 5 and 6 show how discourses concerning identity are reflected in everyday life in San Pablo. Chapters 7 and 8 concern ritual, and focus on local and national identity. These chapters start by attempting to divide rituals of the state from rituals of the locality and introduce the idea that people are cast as ‘consumers’ for rituals of the state, while they are the ‘producers’ of rituals of their own locality (c. f. de Certeau 1984). Ultimately, however, the chapters conclude that such a division is not as clear as it might at first appear, and that it is not a simple matter to separate productive from consumptive practices and the <b>tactics</b> of <b>consumers</b> from the strategies of producers. The chapters end by suggesting that local people have a greater degree of agency than the initial model allowed, and with the proposition that through ritual they produce a locality (Appadurai 1995) that incorporates belonging to the nation. The thesis concludes that agency is essential to the process through which the people of San Pablo arrive at an understanding of themselves and the nation-state. Agency enables them to put themselves beyond the categories that others imagine, that is, to adopt a strategy of making themselves indeterminate. Local people may inherit discourses from the past, and are aware of those of the present, but they do not merely adhere to them, nor do they simply rearrange their elements. They may adopt elements from the different discourses that surround them, but in so doing, they transform them...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} what has been said {{and what can be}} said about women and shoplifting. The first section {{introduces}} and discusses oral history as a method and includes original oral history material through the testimony of Shirley Pitts, who lived in London between 1934 - 1992 and who earned her living as a professional thief. The purpose of this oral history material, and discussion of the oral history method, is not to introduce a `hidden' or 'subjugated' truth about the `essential' nature of women and shoplifting into the debate. Instead, using a methodology associated with Michel Foucault's I Pierre Riviere [FOUCAULT, M., I Pierre Riviere. Having Slaughtered My Mother. My Sister. and My Brother: Case of Patricide in the 19 Century] this oral history material is discussed in order to understand what insights 'unofficial' discourses can offer about women and shoplifting. This approach attempts to ensure `through the re-appearance of this [...] disqualified knowledge that criticism performs its work'. [FOUCAULT, M., Politics. Philosophy. Culture: Interviews and Other Writing] The second section takes up discussion raised in response to the oral transcript of Shirley Pitts about wider issues concerning women, shopping, consumerism and identity. It investigates why official knowledge about women and shopping as well as women and shoplifting has often operated to conceal the idea of women as active agents of crime. The source material for this section of the investigation is intentionally diverse and examines a number of discourses - including those that are historical, sociological, psychological, psychoanalytic, criminological, consumerist, anthropological and media led etc. - in order to reveal an incompatibility between narratives of `femininity' and `criminality' in both historical and contemporary discourse. It is during these discussions that theoretical ideas about discourse, associated with Michel Foucault, are further mobilised to draw attention to silences, contradictions and other problems of information about shoplifting. Consequently, the critical focus herein leads towards consideration of why female crime mythologies, originally linked to an inappropriate model of human nature, construct women as sad, mad or bad. Such mythologies have been reiterated in many diverse ways so that even contemporary criminal statistics are not always helpful when trying to refute inappropriate mythologising of the activities of women who shoplift. Lastly, it is the intention of this thesis to use critical investigations of different types of discourse to consider not only women's relationship to shoplifting, but the relationship of theft to what Guy Debord describes as 'the society of spectacle" [DEBORD, GUY, Society of the Spectacle]. This is because overall, the thesis argues that issues about <b>consumer</b> <b>tactics</b> and visual seduction connect the behaviour of women shoppers and women shoplifters in ways that have been overlooked by official discourses...|$|R
40|$|Audience agency, text-reading practices, and {{the roles}} {{mediated}} cultural texts {{play in the}} lives of readers have long {{been at the center of}} enduring debates among Critical, Cultural, Performance, and Rhetorical Studies scholars. One salient ongoing dialogue among scholars and critics questions the degree to which audiences actively participate in the process of making sense of mediated texts. How capable are media consumers of comprehending and responding to texts containing oppressive discourses? If pop culture is vital in shaping what it means to belong to a culture, can politically minded consumption of cultural texts be a tool by which we can resist or subvert dominant ideologies? This study enters into this dialogue through critical engagement with the emergent embodied audiencing practice of movie riffing, which is characterized by performers talking back to a film, or any matter of mediated text, as it is screened, through a series of humorous and/or critical speech acts. Embracing performative riffing as both a text-reading ethic for negotiating ideologically loaded pop culture texts and a space-based return of embodied performance in a social setting typically characterized by stillness and silence, this study explores the present state of riffing and looks to riffing 2 ̆ 7 s future by theorizing a movie-riffing ethic that constitutes explicitly political performance. This study is divided into eight chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 consider contemporary and historical anecdotes on audiencing practices to situate riffing within a rich legacy of embodied audiencing, text appropriation, meta-commentary, and ritual performance. Chapter 3 discusses the theoretical implications of riffing by situating riffing in scholarly discussions concerning audience agency in making sense of ideologically loaded pop culture texts; I argue riffing explicates the possibilities and constraints of audience agency, all of which should be recognized if riffing is to become a valuable performance <b>tactic</b> by which <b>consumers</b> of U. S. popular culture might enter into struggle over ideologically loaded cultural texts and reclaim a space for embodied audiencing in the cultural marketplace. Chapters 4 through 6 are dedicated to site- and text-specific inquiries into the current state of performative riffing and embodied audiencing. Chapter 4 chronicles my initial foray into ritual embodied audiencing with an ethnographic account of the 24 -hour participatory 2 ̆ 2 bad 2 ̆ 2 movie festival B-Fest. Recounting my experiences of a B-Fest spent riffing alongside a group of enthusiastic B-Fest aficionados, I consider both the shortcomings and potential power of B-Fest riffing as a participatory, embodied audiencing ethic. Chapter 5 continues my exploration into site-specific audiencing rituals and weaves elements of text-specific inquiry, as I examine the popular audiencing ritual of the 2003 film The Room through a lens of Victor Turner 2 ̆ 7 s social drama model. I argue The Room 2 ̆ 7 s audiencing ritual and its related performances constitute part of a discursive struggle between the film 2 ̆ 7 s fanbase and the film 2 ̆ 7 s director, Tommy Wiseau, to claim the film 2 ̆ 7 s enduring success as a midnight movie phenomenon. In describing ways in which audience members interact with the film and each other during screenings of the film, I explore the implications of tactical in-theater performance in reading pop culture texts. Chapter 6 moves out of the realm of physical theaters and into the world of popular media as I explore today 2 ̆ 7 s most famous and influential riffing showcase, Mystery Science Theater 3000, and consider the tactical strengths and weaknesses of its model of movie riffing as a vessel for cultural criticism. I undertake a close textual reading of MST 3 K 2 ̆ 7 s characteristic movie riffing and identify themes that politically minded riffers might utilize to aid their efforts to read and potentially challenge ideologically loaded texts. Yet, recognizing that the discourse of the show at times showcases problematic attitudes that can be read as destructive or offensive in ways that suggest ridiculing a text is not necessarily the same as subverting it, I also consider ways in which MST 3 K 2 ̆ 7 s model of riffing falls short or presents challenges [...] and, therefore, avenues for innovation and growth [...] to politically minded riffers. Chapters 7 and 8 reflect on the lessons gleaned in previous chapters to articulate theoretical contributions and future directions for riffing and embodied audiencing practices. Chapter 7 reflects upon the observations and ideas gathered in Chapters 4 through 6 and localizes them in three related contexts [...] amateur riffing and online communities, mediated activist art, and the political use of humor [...] which I offer as further illuminating possibilities, challenges, and new directions and paradigms for riffing. Finally, Chapter 8 draws from my observations in Chapters 4 through 7 and discusses future directions that performative riffing and embodied audiencing performances provide as text-based discursive tools for interpreting and critiquing mediated cultural texts and the ideologies and interpretations of reality they convey. I glimpse into the future of riffing and in-theater performance and discuss the possibilities of riffing as a method of political performance by which media consumers can talk back to mediated texts and those texts 2 ̆ 7 ideologies and interpretations of reality...|$|R
40|$|Artikel 129 (1) (a) van die Nasionale Kredietwet 34 van 2005 (hierna Kredietwet) bepaal dat 'n verbruiker skriftelik van sy versuim in kennis gestel moet word alvorens 'n kredietverskaffer verdere stappe kan doen om skuld onder 'n kredietooreenkoms af te dwing. Grootskaalse onduidelikheid en verwarring het geheers oor wat presies voldoening aan hierdie bepaling daarstel. Die meerderheid skrywers was van mening dat versending van die kennisgewing deur die kredietgewer voldoende is, maar die howe het in teenstrydige beslissings getoon dat die aangeleentheid nie so eenvoudig is nie. Die hoogste hof van appèl het uiteindelik regsekerheid bewerkstellig deur in Rossouw v First Rand Bank te beslis dat versending per geregistreerde pos aan 'n verbruiker - wat sodanige metode gekies het as wyse waarop kennisgewings kragtens die Kredietwet aan hom afgelewer moet word - voldoening aan artikel 129 (1) (a) daarstel. Die hof beslis verder dat die verbruiker die risiko dra dat die kennisgewing hom moontlik nie sal bereik nie. Hierdie nuutgevonde regsekerheid was egter van korte duur, aangesien die konstitusionele hof in die meerderheidsuitspraak van Sebola v Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd beslis het dat blote versending nievoldoening daarstel nie. Die uitspraak leen hom tot kritiek in vele opsigte, waarvan die sterkste is dat dit teenstrydige stellings bevat en nie duidelik uiteensit wat presies as voldoening gesien kan word nie. Sebola het dus opnuut tot onsekerheid en verwarring gelei, soos duidelik uit twee daaropvolgende uiteenlopende beslissings blyk. In hierdie artikel word die aard, omvang en doel van die artikel 129 (1) (a) -kennisgewing ondersoek ten einde te bepaal wat presies voldoening daaraan behels. Die historiese ontwikkeling van kennisgewingsvereistes in verwante en ander {{relevante}} wetgewing, asook regspraak kragtens sodanige wetgewing, word oorsigtelik in oorweging geneem. Die aanloop tot die uitspraak in Sebola, die Sebola-beslissing in besonder, asook die twee teenstrydige uitsprake daarna word ondersoek ten einde tot 'n gevolgtrekking aangaande die aard van die vereistes van artikel 129 (1) (a) -kennisgewing te kom. The National Credit Act 34 of 2005 (hereafter Credit Act) created {{quite a stir}} on {{the procedural}} front in the ambit of debt enforcement due to its maze of interactive procedural requirements to which a credit provider must adhere during the enforcement procedure. Central to the debt enforcement process is the much debated section 129 (1) (a) notice, the “gateway” to the debt enforcement procedure. Section 129 (1) (a) constitutes the introduction to Part C of Chapter 6 of the Credit Act that deals with “Debt enforcement by repossession or judgment” and provides as follows: 129. Required procedures before debt enforcement 1. If the consumer is in default under a credit agreement, the credit provider – a. may draw the default to the notice of the consumer in writing and propose that the consumer refer the credit agreement to a debt counsellor, alternative dispute resolution agent, consumer court or ombud with jurisdiction, with the intent that the parties resolve any dispute under the agreement or develop and agree {{on a plan to}} bring the payment up to date. A specific aspect of the section 129 (1) (a) notice that gave rise to much confusion due to diverging judgments is the question whether the notice is effective and constitutes compliance with the Credit Act only once the consumer has received the notice. After the judgment of the supreme court of appeal in Rossouw v First Rand Bank it seemed that the issue had been laid to rest. The court decided that the despatching of the notice by registered mail to the consumer – the method chosen by the consumer as the manner in which notices under the Credit Act must be delivered to such a consumer – constitutes compliance with section 129 (1) (a) of the act. The court also held that the consumer carries the risk of non-receipt of the notice {{due to the fact that}} the consumer is allowed to elect the method of delivery. This newly found legal certainty was short-lived as the constitutional court in the majority judgment in Sebola v Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd attached a new interpretation to the section 129 (1) (a) notice requirement. The fact that the decision of the constitutional court did not place the proverbial lid on the notice requirement in terms of the Credit Act became rapidly clear when divisions of the high court thereafter gave contradictory judgments on the effect of the Sebola judgment on the notice requirement in terms of section 129 (1) (a). This article investigates the nature, scope and purpose of the section 129 (1) (a) notice in order to answer the question as to what exactly will constitute compliance with the notice requirement in terms of said section. We refer briefly to the historical development of the notice requirement in related and other relevant legislation as well as leading judgments before Sebola that considered the section 129 (1) (a) notice requirement. Thereafter the judgment of the constitutional court in Sebola as well as specific contradictory statements made in the judgment are set out and analysed in order to come to a conclusion on the correctness of the Sebola judgment. The following conclusions were reached. In our opinion the constitutional court, in an attempt to provide a purposive interpretation for the notice requirement in section 129 (1) (a) of the Credit Act, went too far and arbitrarily expanded the credit provider’s burden of proof. On face value (via paragraph 77 of the judgment) the court created the opportunity for consumers to avoid receipt of the section 129 (1) (a) notice and as a result also the enforcement of the credit agreement. The fact that the Sebola judgment did not contribute to legal certainty becomes clear if the diverging subsequent high court decisions in Nedbank Ltd v Anelene Binneman and Absa Bank Ltd v Mkhize are considered. The constitutional court came to the conclusion, inter alia, that registered mail is more reliable than ordinary mail and the contradictory conclusion of the court in the Mkhize matter, that ordinary mail is more reliable than registered mail - as a large percentage registered mail is returned undelivered – supports our opinion that the postal service is, in general, a reliable despatching system. Ordinary consumers generally receive their mail and do not complain that 70 % of ordinary mail does not reach them. In our opinion, the main reason for the high percentage in undelivered registered mail can be attributed to an avoidance <b>tactic</b> used by <b>consumers</b> rather than to an unreliable postal service. The Credit Act is not an example of breath-taking statutory drafting ingenuity. Precisely in the context of the notice requirement in section 129 (1) (a) the court in Starita v Absa Bank remarked: “The fact is that it is a badly drafted Act … A perusal of the Act further show that the expressions ‘giving written notice’, ‘advise in writing’, ‘give notice’, ‘deliver’ and ‘serve’” are used indiscriminately and without precision. Accordingly, undue emphasis should not be placed on the actual words used. ” The approach to the notice requirement as proposed by Otto and followed in Rossouw is to be preferred as it constitutes a reasonable rule of evidence that sets an objective cut- off point for all methods that the Credit Act envisages for delivery of the section 129 (1) (a) notice as far as proof is concerned. This approach contributes to legal certainty and avoids difficulty pertaining to proof. To add arbitrary layers of proof to a credit provider’s duty to provide notice unnecessarily complicates the interpretation of the Credit Act, contrary to the objective of a balanced and accessible credit market.
