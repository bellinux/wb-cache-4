5|$|Another {{major fire}} {{occurred}} on May 11, 1969 in building 776/777 (the Plutonium Processing Facility), again starting due to spontaneous combustion of plutonium shavings in a glove box. Fire fighters again resorted to fighting <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>with</b> water after dry extinguishers proved ineffective. Despite recommendations after the 1957 fire, suppression systems were {{not built into}} the glove boxes.|$|E
5|$|The Open Cup is {{not held}} in as high regard as the MLS Cup, {{but it is}} still an {{important}} achievement. For Philadelphia, it represented their first-ever chance at a trophy, whereas Seattle had been to the finals five times in the club's six-year history. With a victory, the Sounders would tie <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>with</b> four overall wins by an MLS team.|$|E
5|$|Towing two scows at {{the time}} of the collision, Stella Maris responded {{immediately}} to the fire, anchoring the barges and steaming back towards Pier 6. The tug's captain, Horatio H. Brannen, and his crew realized they were not equipped to fight <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>with</b> their one small hose and quickly backed off from the burning Mont Blanc. They were approached by a whaler from HMS Highflyer and later a steam pinnace belonging to HMCS Niobe. Captain Brannen and Albert Mattison of Niobe agreed to secure a line to the French ship's stern so as to pull it away from the pier to avoid setting it on fire. The five-inch (127-millimetre) hawser initially produced was deemed too small and orders for a ten-inch (254-millimetre) hawser came down. It was at this point that the blast occurred.|$|E

5|$|Assigned {{emergency}} roles {{called for}} Grissom, in the left-hand seat, {{to open the}} cabin pressure vent valve, after which White in the center seat was to open the plug door hatch, while Chaffee in the right-hand seat was to maintain communications. Grissom was prevented from opening the valve by {{the intensity of the}} fire, which started in that region and spread from left to right. Despite this, White removed his restraints and apparently tried in vain to open the hatch, which was held closed by the cabin pressure. The increasing pressure finally burst the inner cabin wall on the right-hand side at 23:31:19 GMT. After approximately thirty seconds of being fed by a cabin atmosphere of pure oxygen at pressures of , and now fed by nitrogen-buffered ambient air, the primary fire decreased in intensity and started producing large amounts of smoke, which killed the astronauts. Chaffee lost consciousness when he experienced myocardial hypoxia, which sent him into cardiac arrest and resulted in cerebral hypoxia. He died from asphyxia due to the toxic gasses from <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> <b>with</b> burns contributing to his death.|$|E
5|$|The thicker {{end of the}} log, the {{end that}} was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance. In Montenegro {{it is called the}} head of the badnjak; the main log is laid on <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>with</b> its head {{pointing}} east. In central Serbia the badnjak is laid with its thicker end sticking out from the ognjište. The household's shepherds would kiss over it to ensure an abundance of lambs in the coming year. In Gruža it is coated with honey which is then licked by children. At the side of ognjište where the thicker end is situated, the family may place a plowshare, a round loaf of bread, a glove filled with wheat, sugar, or a sieve containing grain, honey, cakes, wine, salt, prunes, walnuts, and apples. The cut surface of the thicker end is in Čečava kissed by all the family members after the badnjak is laid on the fire.|$|E

25|$|On 29 December 1993 Union Rotorua {{was about}} 27 {{miles south of}} Sydney Heads, en route for Melbourne, when a fire {{broke out in the}} gas turbine house. It was {{established}} that the seat of the fire was in one of the cubicles of the 6.6 kilovolt switchboard, which distributed power from the gas turbine generator to the propulsion motors and auxiliary electrical systems. Initial attempts to fight <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>with</b> extinguishers proved to be ineffective and a decision was made to utilise the fixed fire fighting medium and flood the space with CO2. This was effective in extinguishing <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> <b>With</b> the high voltage switchboard out of commission, the vessel was towed to Sydney, where it remained for three months undergoing repairs.|$|E

25|$|In 1856, the {{settlement}} structures – the two-storey prison/workshop building, stables, barns and piggery were burnt down. Their former locations are {{identified in the}} area between the shops in {{the settlement}} area. The fire was deliberately lit by the superintendent, Henry Vincent, after two prisoners had escaped into nearby bush. Vincent lit <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>with</b> the intent of flushing the prisoners out of their hiding place. The prevailing winds {{at the time were}} blowing away from the buildings; however, the wind changed direction which brought the flames into the settlement.

Willie, the assistant chef, is of little help. Rebus suspects that Eddie may have been warned off, or worse. Meanwhile, Rebus's superiors are annoyed at the effort he is putting into the Central Hotel case. Undaunted, Rebus approaches Aengus Gibson, who admits being at the hotel {{on the night of}} <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>with</b> Vanderhyde, but insists that he left hours before the fire actually began. Rebus, however, is suspicious. Later that night, Rebus meets up with Deek Torrance, and arranges to buy a handgun from him.|$|E

25|$|At 1 pm the British {{division}} {{had approached}} enough to open {{fire on the}} San Francisco, who had hoisted its flag, ready to engage Galloway's ships, which also hoisted their British flags. The San Francisco then opened fire, and a running battle ensued without intermission until 4 pm. In the process, the San Francisco received the fire of two British frigates which successively shot him with grapeshot. The Spanish ship could only return <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>with</b> the stern chasers of its batteries, although she luffed occasionally to shoot broadsides on the British frigates, inflicting serious damage. The British gunners, noted for their skill through the war, were not particularly accurate during the action, and San Francisco, already hit by the storm, didn't suffer serious damage.|$|E

However, she was such a good person that the animals living around the temple began to help her with her chores. Her father, seeing this, became so frustrated that he attempted to burn down the temple. Miaoshan put out <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>with</b> her bare hands and suffered no burns. Now struck with fear, her father ordered her to be put to death.|$|E

This {{may well have}} been Jagdstaffel 12 commanding officer Adolf Ritter von Tutschek. Joachim von Bertrab was taken prisoner of war on 12 August when forced down behind British lines for Mannock's 6th victory. Bertrab's fighter caught fire but his close proximity to the ground (1,000ft) enabled him to make a controlled landing and escape <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>with</b> a fractured left arm and wounds to the right arm and leg. Mannock also made two further uncredited claims in his combat report but they were not even marked as uncredited in official sources.
