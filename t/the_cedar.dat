50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cedars</b> is an unincorporated {{community}} in Placer County, California. <b>The</b> <b>Cedars</b> {{is located on}} Cedar Creek, 4.5 mi south-southwest of Donner Pass. It lies at an elevation of 5787 feet (1764 m).|$|R
5|$|In the 1860s {{during the}} American Civil War, housing for {{a battery of}} four field {{artillery}} pieces was constructed {{at the tip of}} the peninsula. It was used to defend a prison for Confederate soldiers on nearby Johnson's Island. Louis Zistel, a German immigrant, built two boats to transport the prisoners. In 1870, he began to ferry locals to <b>the</b> <b>Cedar</b> Point peninsula, which was regaining popularity as a summer picnic destination. Zistel opened a bathhouse on the north shore of the peninsula and the same year built a beer garden with a small dance floor. He charged 25 cents per person to ride from Sandusky to Cedar Point on his boat, Young Reindeer. This marked the beginning of commercial tourism on <b>the</b> <b>Cedar</b> Point peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Lighthouse Point {{contains}} 64 cottages and 40 {{cabins and}} is located {{along the west}} bank of the peninsula. The centerpiece of Lighthouse Point is <b>the</b> <b>Cedar</b> Point Light, which was built in 1862 and is the oldest existing structure on the peninsula. It has an outdoor pool and outdoor whirlpool spa, a shuffleboard court, a game room, and shuttle service.|$|E
5|$|Other recent, but undescribed, discoveries {{include a}} {{complete}} skull from the Cloverly of Montana {{and a huge}} fragmentary skeleton from <b>the</b> <b>Cedar</b> Mountain Formation of Utah. These discoveries have been published only as abstracts for the annual Society of Vertebrate Paleontology conference, and {{may or may not}} prove to belong to S. edwardsorum or even Sauropelta when formally published.|$|E
50|$|Kimberly was {{originally}} known as <b>The</b> <b>Cedars</b> (after <b>the</b> Treaty of <b>the</b> <b>Cedars).</b> In 1889 it was renamed after John A. Kimberly (1838-1928), {{one of the}} co-founders {{of what is now}} the Kimberly-Clark Corporation.|$|R

50|$|Iris cedreti {{is highly}} threatened. In 1996, Mouterde {{published}} {{that it had}} a wide range and found populations near <b>the</b> <b>Cedars,</b> between Ehden and <b>the</b> <b>Cedars,</b> and near Hasroun. But by 2001, Tohme and Tohme published that only populations near <b>the</b> <b>Cedars</b> were found. In 2009, it was listed as Endangered, as 50% of the known populations of the iris had been lost. By 2016 it was listed as critically endangered by the IUCN.|$|R
5|$|The {{waxwings}} are a family, Bombycillidae, of short-tailed stocky {{birds with}} soft plumage, a head crest and distinctively patterned wings and tails. There are three species, the Bohemian, cedar, and Japanese waxwings. DNA studies and shared {{features such as}} a relatively large size, grey underparts and similar undertail patterns suggest that the Japanese and Bohemian waxwings are most closely related within the genus. Although only <b>the</b> <b>cedar</b> and Bohemian waxwings normally have red tips on their wing feathers, this feature is occasionally shown by the Japanese waxwing, suggesting that this was originally a whole-family characteristic that has been lost in one species, rather than an indicator of a close relationship. DNA analysis confirms that <b>the</b> <b>cedar</b> waxwing diverged early from {{the other members of}} the family. Outside the genus, the closest relatives of the waxwings are believed to be the silky-flycatchers, the palmchat, and the grey hypocolius, all of which have sometimes been included in the Bombycillidae.|$|E
5|$|Cedar Point {{owns and}} {{operates}} six resorts located either on park grounds or {{less than a mile}} away. Most of the resorts are within walking distance of <b>the</b> <b>Cedar</b> Point Beach. All facilities are non-smoking, and all Cedar Point Resort guests can enter the park one hour before it opens to the general public. Rides that operate during this early-entry session are: Valravn, Millennium Force, Maverick, GateKeeper, Tiki Twirl, Cadillac Cars, Dodgem, Cedar Downs, Midway Carousel, and Kiddie Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Easy is {{the most}} recent major {{hurricane}} to strike the Homosassa, Florida, area. Due to the hurricane remaining near the northwest Florida coast {{for an extended period}} of time, Easy produced severe rainfall and strong waves, resulting in heavy damage in <b>the</b> <b>Cedar</b> Key area. Hurricane Easy was one of two major hurricanes to strike Florida during the year; the other was Hurricane King which affected Miami.|$|E

5|$|Flukes (Trematoda) {{from the}} {{subclass}} Digenea are common parasites of small mammals with complex life cycles. In his 1988 study, Kinsella found an unprecedentend 21species of trematodes in Florida marsh rice rats. The intermediate hosts of these trematodes include {{a variety of}} invertebrates, fish, and amphibians, which are eaten by the marsh rice rat. Trematodes were generally more common at <b>the</b> <b>Cedar</b> Key saltwater marsh than at the freshwater marsh in Paynes Prairie.|$|E
5|$|I-380 crosses two of Iowa's major rivers, the Iowa and <b>the</b> <b>Cedar.</b> Both rivers have {{affected}} the interstate during major floods, as the case was in 1993 and in 2008. During the Great Flood of 1993, I-380 and Iowa965 were both closed at the Iowa River's Coralville Lake reservoir between July 13 and July 28. The roads reopened after the lake's waters receded enough to allow Department of Transportation inspectors to check the three bridges over the water.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Carpenter {{and colleagues}} {{described}} material {{of a large}} nodosaurid from Utah, discovered in a member of <b>the</b> <b>Cedar</b> Mountain Formation called the Poison Strip Sandstone, which is contemporaneous with the Cloverly Formation. He originally referred it to Sauropelta as a possible new species, {{but it was never}} named. In more recent publications, Carpenter no longer refers the Poison Strip animal to Sauropelta, only to the family Nodosauridae.|$|E

5|$|Settlement in {{the region}} of Gaza dates back to 3300–3000 BCE at Tell as-Sakan, a site located south of the present-day city, which began as an Ancient Egyptian {{fortress}} built in Canaanite territory. Tell as-Sakan prospered as Canaanite cities began to trade agricultural goods with the Egyptians. However, when Egypt's economic interests shifted to <b>the</b> <b>cedar</b> trade with Lebanon, Gaza's role was reduced to that of a port for ships carrying goods and it declined economically. The site was virtually abandoned and remained so throughout the Early Bronze Age II.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice {{was also}} honoured by various other countries, and {{was made a}} member of the National Order of <b>the</b> <b>Cedar</b> by Lebanon in 1955.

5|$|The Dakotas, who {{had volunteered}} 150 warriors {{to fight against}} the Sauks and Meskwakis, also arrived too late to {{participate}} in the Battle of Bad Axe, but they pursued the members of the British Band who made it across the Mississippi into Iowa. On about August 9, in the final engagement of the war, they attacked the remnants of the British Band along <b>the</b> <b>Cedar</b> River, killing 68 and taking 22 prisoners. Ho-Chunks also hunted survivors of the British Band, taking between fifty and sixty scalps.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of timber continued onto the mainland, prompting one observer to remark that no usable trees were left standing between {{the mouths of}} the Waccasassa and Suwannee rivers. In Williston, nearly a dozen residences were destroyed, killing {{at least one person}} and injuring 15 more. Six prison inmates were killed by a falling tree on a farm near the town, and in total, about 13 people lost their lives in mainland Levy County. Damage throughout the county, including <b>the</b> <b>Cedar</b> Keys, was estimated at $450,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of I-380 opened to traffic on September 19, 1973. That section {{connected}} The Eastern Iowa Airport to I-80 at Coralville. Within three years, the interstate had been extended into Cedar Rapids at <b>the</b> <b>Cedar</b> River. The bridge which crossed the river would not open until June 1979. By the end of 1981, I-380 was a continuous road to the Coldstream Avenue/Glass Road interchange. The interstate was originally scheduled to be open by Christmas 1984, but weather delays pushed back the construction timetable. The last section of I-380 to be completed opened on September 12, 1985.|$|E
