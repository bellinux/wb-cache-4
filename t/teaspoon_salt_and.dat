30|$|The {{monitors}} {{were asked}} to report the salinity level {{of the water in}} each tube well, using the corresponding tube well tag number, to the local partner every week by phone. To complement the tube well profiles, the monitors visited each household that owned the monitored tube wells and asked about the number of family members, the monthly household income, and the amount of salt added while eating three meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) as well as added while cooking. The households were asked how much they consumed salt during a onetime survey period of three consecutive days, from Wednesday to Friday, to include both weekdays (Wednesday and Thursday) and a weekend day (Friday). Salt for cooking was measured in teaspoons, and for consistency in measurement the monitors carried the same <b>teaspoon</b> for reference. <b>Salt</b> added while eating was measured in pinches. All the households used unrefined salt (Khola labon) for both cooking <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> table <b>salt.</b> The weight of one <b>teaspoon</b> <b>salt</b> measured with an electronic scale was equivalent to 6 – 8  g. To convert the salt amounts into grams, 7  g was counted as one <b>teaspoon</b> of <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> 0.6  g was counted as one pinch of salt. For depicting data plots and performing statistical analyses of salt intake of households, tube well profiles (salinity and geographical conditions), and economic variables of households, the SAS university edition software (SAS Studio 3.6 with the fourth maintenance release for SAS 9.4) was used.|$|R

40|$|The {{flavor and}} texture of the final meat, poultry, or game product depends on how the meat is handled {{following}} slaughter. If you slaughter your own meat, contact your county Extension educator for information. Use only meat from healthy, disease-free animals. The meat should be chilled without delay to 40 degrees F (or lower to prevent spoilage. To hold longer than a few days, freeze at 0 degrees F or lower until canning time. Rinse poultry thoroughly in cold water and drain. Handle meat rapidly and keep everything that touches the meat clean. Debone red meats. Trim off all gristle, bruised spots, and excess fat before canning. Any fat left on the meat may affect sealing. Meat, poultry, and game are low-acid foods and must be processed in a pressure canner at 10 to 15 pounds of pressure per square inch (psi) for safety. See Tables 1, 2, and 3 for processing times for all meat types and stock. Meat can be packed either raw or cooked. Pack meat loosely into clean canning jars. Keep precooked meat hot while packing and cover with boiling liquid. Salt adds flavor, but is not necessary for preservation. When ready to serve, boil canned meat and poultry 10 minutes before you taste it—even if it looks and smells all right. If {{this is your first}} time canning, it is suggested that you read “Canning Basics ” for instructions on filling and processing recommendations. Poultry, Rabbit, or Squirrel Choose freshly killed and dressed, healthy animals. Large chickens are more flavorful than fryers. Dressed poultry should be chilled for 6 to 12 hours before canning. Dressed rabbits or squirrels should be soaked 1 hour in water containing 1 tablespoon of salt per quart, then rinsed. Remove excess fat. Cut the poultry, rabbit, or squirrel into suitable sizes for canning. Can with or without bones. Hot Pack Boil, steam, or bake meat until about two-thirds done. If desired, add 1 <b>teaspoon</b> <b>salt</b> per quart. Fill jars with meat pieces and boiling broth, leaving 1 -inch headspace. Raw Pack If desired, add 1 <b>teaspoon</b> <b>salt</b> per quart.

Some recipes use green tea while others use black tea. Some recipes even include butter or fat. Milk in Mongolia is typically fresh, whole milk, and using half and half instead of milk produces a rich beverage close to the authentic. The amount of salt in the tea is also often varied. Sometimes the milk in the tea is omitted if not available. Another common addition to the suutei tsai is fried millet.|$|R
