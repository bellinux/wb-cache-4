Chlorophyll a:b ratio was lower in plants grown at enhanced level of UV-B till preflowering stage thereafter increased compared to the control. Anthocyanin concentration was higher initially but later reduced in UV-B <b>treated</b> <b>plants.</b> Absorbance profile of flavonoids showed higher values in <b>plants</b> <b>treated</b> at enhanced UV-B. Total plant biomass was higher for UV-B <b>treated</b> <b>plants</b> at all stages of growth compared to untreated control. Net primary productivity also showed a pattern similar to biomass accumulation. The study clearly indicates that corn is resistant to enhanced UV-B levels predicted at 20 % ozone depletion under field conditions...|$|R

40|$|Stevia rebaudiana is a {{well known}} natural sweetener. The {{sweetness}} is due to steviol glycosides, the glucosylated steviol derivatives of steviol glycoside biosynthesis pathway. In tissue culture conditions, sucrose is utilized as carbon source. In present study, we analyzed the effect of varying sucrose (1, 3 and 5 %) concentrations on the genes involved in steviol glycoside biosynthesis pathway and content of steviol glycosides. The higher endogenous sucrose content in 5 % sucrose <b>treated</b> <b>plants</b> than that in 3 or 1 % <b>treated</b> <b>plants</b> suggested the uptake of exogenously available sucrose by plants. The transcript expression profiling of genes involved in steviol glycoside biosynthesis pathway showed an overall increase in the expression of pathway specific genes; CDPS, KS, KO, UGT 85 C 2 and UGT 76 G 1 in 5 % sucrose <b>treated</b> <b>plants</b> compared to that in 1 and 3 % <b>treated</b> <b>plants.</b> Furthermore, the quantitative estimation of steviol glycosides in leaves revealed that approximately 4. 5 times higher glycosides accumulated in 5 % sucrose <b>treated</b> <b>plants</b> than that in 3 and 1 % <b>treated</b> <b>plants.</b> However, 1 and 5 % sucrose was to be affecting stomatal and trichome density, including the germination rate in comparison to 3 % sucrose. Present work thus suggests that sucrose might be acting as an enhancer of transcriptional trigger to the genes of steviol glycoside biosynthesis pathway that could positively manipulate the production of steviol glycosides...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to examine}} the effect of cadmium on membrane lipid biosynthesis, lipid peroxidation levels and the reduced thiol (-SH) content in leaves of Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) and oilseed rape (Brassica napus) <b>treated</b> <b>plants.</b> Two weeks-old-plants from each specie are subjected to various CdCl 2 concentrations (0, 10, 25 and 50 μM) in the hydroponic medium, for 15 days. Results showed a marked differences between both species. Total lipid content decrease dramatically in Brassica napus leaves. Whereas, amount of total lipids was significantly increased in Brassica juncea <b>treated</b> <b>plants.</b> Compared to Brassica juncea, Brassica napus <b>treated</b> <b>plants</b> showed a higher lipid peroxidation level expressed as malondialdehyde production. Studies of the lipid metabolism using radioactive labelling with (1 - 14 C) acetate as a major precursor of lipid biosynthesis, showed that levels of radioactivity incorporation in total lipids of Brassica napus leaves were lowered by Cd doses. While they were enhanced in Brassica juncea <b>treated</b> <b>plants.</b> Moreover, results led to the conclusion that, under heavy metal stress, considerable changes in polar lipids metabolism were observed in both species. In Brassica napus <b>treated</b> <b>plants,</b> cadmium stress provoked an inhibition of the chloroplastic lipids biosynthesis pathway while a stimulation of the extra-chloroplastic lipid metabolism was occurring. However, in Brassica juncea <b>treated</b> <b>plants,</b> the both pathways were stimulated under cadmium treatment. Level of reduced thiol content in roots and leaves of Brassica juncea <b>treated</b> <b>plants</b> was found more higher at all Cd treatment as compared to Brassica napus. The tolerance exhibited by Brassica juncea to Cd toxicity may be attributed to the enhanced lipid synthesis leading to a better compartimentalization of Cd ions as Cd-phytochelatin complexes in the cell vacuoles or in the vesicles formation...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the endogenous hormones content of cotton plants grown hydroponically, and supplied with varying levels of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) mineral nutrients in the first cropping. In the second cropping, varying levels of exogenous indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), gibberellic acid (GA 3) and zeatin (Z) and their combinations were applied to high level of PK in the hydroponic. In the first experiment, low K and low P <b>treated</b> <b>plants</b> had higher content of gibberellic acid (GA 3) in the leaves than high PK <b>treated</b> <b>plants,</b> and low K <b>treated</b> <b>plants</b> also produced more Zeatin (Z) in the leaves than either low P or high PK <b>treated</b> <b>plants.</b> Furthermore, low K <b>treated</b> <b>plants</b> had higher Zeatin (Z) content in the root than either low P or high PK <b>treated</b> <b>plants.</b> However, the two cotton varieties expressed different hormones content in the leaves, stem and root. In the second experiment, GA 3 concentration was highest in the cotton stem treated to IAA x GA 3 x Z. Moreover, Zeatin content in the leaves, stem and root was highest in the cotton treated to IAA x GA 3 x Z and 2 IAA x 2 GA 3 x 2 Z for leaves, IAA x GA 3 x Z for stem and Z, IAA x 2 GA 3 x Z for root. Nevertheless, two cotton varieties possessed different hormones content in the leaves, stem and root. In general, there was no relationship between the first cropping and second cropping.

The water was high in silt, salt and gypsum.
