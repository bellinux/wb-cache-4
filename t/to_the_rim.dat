Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In what is perhaps a twist of irony, modern-day Lake Powell, which floods Glen Canyon, is also named for their leader.|$|E

40|$|We {{report that}} {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 (HSV- 1) {{infection}} leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recruitment of protein kinase C (PKC) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nuclear <b>rim.</b> In HEp- 2 cells, PKC recruitment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nuclear <b>rim</b> was initiated between 8 h and 12 h postinfection. PKCδ, a proapoptotic kinase, was completely recruited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nuclear <b>rim</b> upon infection with HSV- 1. PKCα was less dramatically relocalized mostly at <b>the</b> nuclear <b>rim</b> upon infection, although some PKCα remained in the cytoplasm. PKCζ-specific immunofluorescence was not significantly relocated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nuclear <b>rim.</b> <b>The</b> UL 34 and UL 31 proteins, {{as well as their}} association, were each required for PKC recruitment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nuclear <b>rim.</b> <b>The</b> HSV- 1 US 3 protein product, a kinase which regulates the phosphorylation state and localization of UL 34, was not required for PKC recruitment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nuclear rim; however, it was required for proper localization along <b>the</b> nuclear <b>rim,</b> as PKC appeared unevenly distributed along <b>the</b> nuclear <b>rim</b> of cells infected with US 3 null and kinase-dead mutants. HSV- 1 infection induced the phosphorylation of both lamin B and PKC. Elevated lamin B phosphorylation in HSV- 1 -infected cells was partially reduced by inhibitors of PKC. The data suggest a model in which kinases that normally disassemble the nuclear lamina during apoptosis are recruited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nuclear membrane through functions requiring UL 31 and UL 34. We hypothesize that the recruitment of PKC functions to phosphorylate lamin B <b>to</b> help modify <b>the</b> nuclear lamina and promote budding of nucleocapsids at the inner nuclear membrane...|$|R
25|$|A Ferris wheel (sometimes {{called a}} big wheel, {{observation}} wheel, or, {{in the case}} of the very tallest examples, giant wheel) is a nonbuilding structure consisting of a rotating upright wheel with multiple passenger-carrying components (commonly referred to as passenger cars, cabins, tubs, capsules, gondolas, or pods) attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> in such a way that as the wheel turns, they are kept upright, usually by gravity.|$|E

25|$|The immortal souls {{that follow}} the gods most closely {{are able to}} just barely raise their chariots up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> and look out on reality. They see some things and miss others, {{having to deal with}} their horses; they rise and fall at varying times. Other souls, while {{straining}} to keep up, are unable to rise, and in noisy, sweaty discord they leave uninitiated, not having seen reality. Where they go after is then dependent on their own opinions, rather than the truth. Any soul that catches sight of any true thing is granted another circuit where it can see more; eventually, all souls fall back to earth. Those that have been initiated are put into varying human incarnations, depending on how much they have seen; those made into philosophers have seen the most, while kings, statesmen, doctors, prophets, poets, manual laborers, sophists, and tyrants follow respectively.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 2014, Paul George, who {{was playing}} in a Team USA {{scrimmage}} {{in preparation for the}} FIBA World Cup, suffered a catastrophic open fracture to his right leg (tibia and fibula) while trying to defend James Harden on a fast break. As he tried to defend Harden from advancing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim,</b> George's leg caught on the stanchion of the hoop, and fractured. He was stretchered off of the court. Many described his injury as one of the worst and most graphic injuries they'd seen since the Kevin Ware incident. A day later, George successfully underwent surgery. He was expected to miss the entire 2014–2015 season. On April 5, 2015 Paul George returned from his injury to play in a game against the Miami Heat. George shot 5 of 12 from the field and tallied two steals, two rebounds and two assists in a winning effort. He played 15 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Brake pads are {{available}} with numerous shapes and materials. Many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting, or brake shoe, with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake. Some are made as one piece with the attachment directly molded in the pad for lower production costs; brake pads of the cartridge type are {{held in place by}} a metal split pin or threaded grub screw and can be replaced without moving the brake shoe from its alignment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim.</b> The rubber can be softer for more braking force with less lever effort, or harder for longer life. Many pad designs have a rectangular shape; others are longer and curved to match the radius of the rim. Larger pads do not necessarily provide more braking force, but will wear more slowly (in relation to thickness), so can usually be thinner. In general, a brake can be fitted with a variety of pads, as long as the mounting is compatible. Carbon fiber rims may be more sensitive to damage by incorrectly-matched brake pads, and generally must use non-abrasive cork pads.|$|E

25|$|In King Henry III's long reign (1216–1272) the short-cross penny {{continued}} in use until 1247. By then, however, {{through no fault}} of the moneyers' there was a problem in that many of the coins in circulation were underweight. This was caused by the illegal practice of clipping silver {{off the edge of the}} coin, which was made easier by the cross on the reverse not extending <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> thus giving people no clear indication of exactly how big the coin was supposed to be. In 1247 therefore, a new long-cross penny replaced the short-cross coin, which made it more obvious when the coin had been clipped. Apart from the change in the size of the cross, the rest of the design did not substantially change, and the long cross made it easy to cut the coin into halves or quarters for change. Because of the introduction of the new coinage it was necessary to reopen many of the old mints to supply sufficient coins. Short-cross Henry III pennies were minted at Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Durham, London, Winchester and York. Long-cross pennies were produced at Bristol, Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Carlisle, Durham, Exeter, Gloucester, Hereford, Ilchester, Lincoln, London, Newcastle, Northampton, Norwich, Oxford, Shrewsbury, Wallingford, Wilton, Winchester, and York.|$|E
25|$|In Borealis Planitia, however, most of {{the ridges}} are of {{external}} origin. They appear either to outline the rim crests of subjacent ghost craters that are lightly mantled by smooth plains material or to be lava flow fronts. The map shows the rim crests of 20 ghost craters, ranging in diameter from 40 to 160 km, that are buried under the smooth plains material of Borealis Planitia, which material is coextensive with the fill covering {{the floor of the}} Goethe Basin. In addition, ejecta from the crater Depréz extend more than 40 km eastward beyond a circular scarp that may represent the rim crest of a buried crater 170 km in diameter (FDS 156, 160) or, more likely, the front of lava flows. The size and density of these ghost craters suggest that, prior to emplacement of smooth plains material, the original heavily cratered surface of Borealis Planitia—which may have been the cratered floor of a very large multiring impact basin—and the cratered floor of the Goethe Basin were similar in composition and age to the intercrater plains material of the highlands to the west. Many scarps in Borealis Planitia are subconcentric <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the Goethe Basin and have steeper slopes that face away from it, suggesting that they represent the fronts of lava flows that resurfaced extensive areas of heavily cratered terrain (intercrater or older plains material).|$|E
