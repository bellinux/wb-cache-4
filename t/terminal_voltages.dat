On the basis of previous study, a mode-switching control strategy of supercapacitor for the regenerative and semiactive suspension system was proposed, and the mode-switching rule was built.

40|$|The ac-side <b>terminal</b> <b>voltages</b> of parallel-connected {{converters}} {{are different}} if the line reactive drops {{of the individual}} converters are different. This could result either from differences in per-phase inductances or from differences in the line currents of the converters. In such cases, the modulating signals are different for the converters. Hence, the common-mode (CM) voltages for the converters, injected by conventional space vector pulsewidth modulation (CSVPWM) to increase dc-bus utilization, are different. Consequently, significant low-frequency zero-sequence circulating currents result. This paper proposes a new modulation method for parallel-connected converters with unequal <b>terminal</b> <b>voltages.</b> This method does not cause low-frequency zero-sequence circulating currents and is comparable with CSVPWM in terms of dc-bus utilization and device power loss.
