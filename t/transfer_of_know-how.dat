Further, four poles/programmes of cultural attraction will be developed. The first, [...] "A city for Europe", will relate to the architectural heritage, the industrial revolution and similar subjects. [...] "The counterpart cities" [...] programme will be developed in the fields of human and social sciences and in diverse artistic fields. [...] "The three sea battles" [...] will present a cultural programme focusing on peace and understanding. The last theme, [...] "The many homelands", is directly linked to the etymology of the name of the city.

40|$|Focusing on the {{management}} of voluntary and involuntary <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>know-how</b> in imperfect competition, the Industrial Organisation models on R&D cooperation have generated results {{that seem to be}} robust across a wide variety of models. This paper reviews the mainstream IO models and results. A major finding is that when spillovers exceed some critical level, cooperation in R&D is beneficial to technical progress and leads to higher profits for the partners. Trying to further enrich these models, recent theoretical developments have studied the issues of stability of R&D cooperation, explaining why attractive alliances are not always formed. The various mechanisms, which this literature suggests to turn R&D cooperation into stable profitable agreements, are discussed. Finally, the scarce empirical evidence that exists to test some of the theoretical hypotheses is reviewed. status: publishe...|$|R
