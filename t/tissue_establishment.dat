40|$|SummaryPlants have a {{remarkable}} potential for sustained (indeterminate) postembryonic growth. Following their specification {{in the early}} embryo, tissue-specific precursor cells first establish tissues and later maintain them postembryonically. The mechanisms underlying these processes are largely unknown. Here we define local control of oriented, periclinal cell division as the mechanism underlying both the establishment and maintenance of vascular tissue. We identify an auxin-regulated basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor dimer as a critical regulator of vascular development. Due {{to a loss of}} periclinal divisions, vascular tissue gradually disappears in bHLH-deficient mutants; conversely, ectopic expression is sufficient for triggering periclinal divisions. We show that this dimer operates independently of tissue identity but is restricted to a small vascular domain by integrating overlapping transcription patterns of the interacting bHLH proteins. Our work reveals a common mechanism for <b>tissue</b> <b>establishment</b> and indeterminate vascular development and provides a conceptual framework for developmental control of local cell divisions...|$|E

40|$|AIM: The aims of {{this project}} were to analyze the factors that {{influence}} quality and safety of tissues for transplantation and to develop the method to ensure standards of quality and safety in relation to tissue banking as demanded by European Directive 2004 / 23 /EC and its technical annexes. It is organized in 4 Working Groups, the objectives of each one being focused in a specific area. STANDARDS: The Guide of Recommendations for Tissue Banking is structured into 4 parts: (1) quality systems that apply to tissue banking and general quality system requirements, (2) regulatory framework in Europe, (3) standards available, and (4) recommendations of the fundamental quality and safety keypoints. REGISTRY: This Working Group handled design of a multinational musculoskeletal tissue registry prototype. TRAINING: This Working Group handled design and validation of a specialized training model structured into online and face-to-face courses. The model was improved with suggestions from students, and 100 % certification was obtained. AUDIT: The Guide for Auditing <b>Tissue</b> <b>Establishments</b> provides guidance for auditors, a self-assessment questionnaire, and an audit report form. The effectiveness and sustainability of the outputs were assessed. Both guides are useful for experienced <b>tissue</b> <b>establishments</b> and auditors and also for professionals that are starting in the field. The registry prototype proves it is possible to exchange <b>tissues</b> between <b>establishments</b> throughout Europe. The training model has been effective in educating staff and means having professionals with excellent expertise. Member states could adapt/adopt it.

40|$|Plant {{development}} {{is characterized by}} repeated initiation of meristems, regions of dividing cells {{that give rise to}} new organs. During lateral root (LR) formation, new LR meristems are specified to support the outgrowth of LRs along a new axis. The determination of the sequential events required to form this new growth axis has been hampered by redundant activities of key transcription factors. Here, we characterize the effects of three PLETHORA (PLT) transcription factors, PLT 3, PLT 5, and PLT 7, during LR outgrowth. In plt 3 plt 5 plt 7 triple mutants, the morphology of lateral root primordia (LRP), the auxin response gradient, and the expression of meristem/ tissue identity markers are impaired from the “symmetry-breaking” periclinal cell divisions during the transition between stage I and stage II, wherein cells first acquire different identities in the proximodistal and radial axes. Particularly, PLT 1, PLT 2, and PLT 4 genes that are typically expressed later than PLT 3, PLT 5, and PLT 7 during LR outgrowth are not induced in the mutant primordia, rendering “PLT-null” LRP. Reintroduction of any PLT clade member in the mutant primordia completely restores layer identities at stage II and rescues mutant defects in meristem and <b>tissue</b> <b>establishment.</b> Therefore, all PLT genes can activate the formative cell divisions that lead to de novo meristem establishment and tissue patterning associated with a new growth axis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Collective cell {{polarization}} is {{an important}} characteristic of tissues. Epithelia commonly display cellular structures that are polarized within {{the plane of the}} <b>tissue.</b> <b>Establishment</b> of this planar cell polarity requires mechanisms that locally align polarized structures between neighbouring cells, as well as cues that provide global information about alignment relative to an axis of a tissue. In the Drosophila ovary, the cadherin Fat 2 is required to orient actin filaments located at the basal side of follicle cells perpendicular to the long axis of the egg chamber. The mechanisms directing this orientation of actin filaments, however, remain unknown. Here we show, using genetic mosaic analysis, that fat 2 is not essential for the local alignment of actin filaments between neighbouring cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that Fat 2 is involved in the propagation of a cue specifying the orientation of actin filaments relative to the tissue axis. Monte Carlo simulations of actin filament orientation resemble the results of the genetic mosaic analysis, if it is assumed that a polarity signal can propagate from a signal source only through a connected chain of wild-type cells. Our results suggest that Fat 2 is required for propagating global polarity information within the follicle epithelium through direct cell–cell contact. Our computational model might be more generally applicable to study collective cell polarization in tissues...|$|E

Results Among commissioning couples, mean&# 177;SD female and male age was 41. 9 &# 177; 3. 7 and 44. 6 &# 177; 3. 5 yrs, respectively. During this period, female age for non dual anonymous gamete donation IVF patients was 37. 9 &# 177; 3 yrs (p < 0. 001).

Conclusions Mean age of females undergoing dual anonymous donor gamete donation with IVF is significantly higher than the background IVF patient population. Even when neither partner is able to contribute any gametes for IVF, the clinical pregnancy rate per transfer can be satisfactory if both anonymous egg and sperm donation are used concurrently.

40|$|The Drosophila melanogaster HSC 3 and HSC 4 genes encode Hsc 70 {{proteins}} homologous to the mammalian {{endoplasmic reticulum}} (ER) protein BiP and the cytoplasmic clathrin uncoating ATPase, respectively. These proteins possess ATP binding/hydrolysis activities that mediate {{their ability to}} aid in protein folding by coordinating the sequential binding and release of misfolded proteins. To investigate the roles of HSC 3 (Hsc 3 p) and HSC 4 (Hsc 4 p) proteins during development, GAL 4 -targeted gene expression was {{used to analyze the}} effects of producing dominant negatively acting Hsc 3 p (D 231 S, K 97 S) and Hsc 4 p (D 206 S, K 71 S) proteins, containing single amino acid substitutions in their ATP-binding domains, in specific tissues of Drosophila throughout development. We show that the production of each mutant protein results in lethality over a range of developmental stages, depending on the levels of protein produced and which tissues are targeted. We demonstrate that the functions of both Hsc 3 p and Hsc 4 p are required for proper <b>tissue</b> <b>establishment</b> and maintenance. Production of mutant Hsc 4 p, but not Hsc 3 p, results in induction of the stress-inducible Hsp 70 at normal temperatures. Evidence is presented that lethality is caused by tissue-specific defects that result from a global accumulation of misfolded protein caused by lack of functional Hsc 70. We show that both mutant Hsc 3 ps are defective in ATP-induced substrate release, although Hsc 3 p(D 231 S) does undergo an ATP-induced conformational change. We believe that the amino acid substitutions in Hsc 3 p interfere with the structural coupling of ATP binding to substrate release, and this defect is the basis for the mutant proteins’ dominant negative effects in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{mammary gland}} {{is a dynamic}} organ that {{undergoes}} dramatic physiological adaptations during the transition from late pregnancy to lactation. Investigation of the molecular basis of mammary development and function will provide fundamental insights into tissue remodelling {{as well as a}} better understanding of milk production and mammary disease. This is important to livestock production systems and human health. Here we use RNA-seq to identify differences in gene expression in the ovine mammary gland between late pregnancy and lactation. Results: Between late pregnancy (135 days of gestation[*]±[*] 2. 4 SD) and lactation (15 days post partum[*]±[*] 1. 27 SD) 13 % of genes in the sheep genome were differentially expressed in the ovine mammary gland. In late pregnancy, cell proliferation, beta-oxidation of fatty acids and translation were identified as key biological processes. During lactation, high levels of milk fat synthesis were mirrored by enrichment of genes associated with fatty acid biosynthesis, transport and lipogenesis. Protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum was enriched during lactation, likely in support of active milk protein synthesis. Hormone and growth factor signalling and activation of signal transduction pathways, including the JAK-STAT and PPAR pathways, were also differently regulated, indicating key roles for these pathways in functional development of the ovine mammary gland. Changes in the expression of epigenetic regulators, particularly chromatin remodellers, indicate a possible role in coordinating the large-scale transcriptional changes that appear to be required to switch mammary processes from growth and development during late pregnancy to synthesis and secretion of milk during lactation. Conclusions: Coordinated transcriptional regulation of large numbers of genes is required to switch between mammary <b>tissue</b> <b>establishment</b> during late pregnancy, and activation and maintenance of milk production during lactation. Our findings indicate the remarkable plasticity of the mammary gland, and the coordinated regulation of multiple genes and pathways to begin milk production.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{morphology}} of the optic cushion and ocelli of the sea star Leptasterias polaris (Müller and Troschel) was undertaken to provide a description of their fully differentiated condition, and as a comparison with similar work on the ocelli of other species of asteroids and on the photoreceptors of other animals. In addition, {{the development of the}} optic cushion and its ocelli through embryogenesis, and the regeneration of adult tissues were investigated. For these studies, larvae of L. polaris, and the optic region of the fully formed adult, and of adult regenerating rays, were examined by light, scanning electron, and transmission electron microscopy. [...] The ocelli consisted of numerous pigmented and sensory cells that lined a lumen. The designation of the sensory cells as ciliary photo-sensory receptors was confirmed by observations of the prominence and microtubular irregularities of the numerous cilia present in the lumen, and by the origin of villi from the base of their shafts, {{as well as from the}} cell membrane of the expanded apical portions of the sensory cells. The presence of coated cell membrane invaginations, coated vesicles, and multivesicular bodies, suggested a mechanism of endocytosis of villous membrane, such as has been documented as a photoreceptoral membrane recycling pathway in rhabdomeric photoreceptors. [...] The pigmented cells possessed small pigment granules, and larger polymorphic bodies proposed to be stages in autophagocytosis. Corneal cells subserved a supportive function, surrounding the ocellus and projecting processes containing vesicular profiles and a microfilamentous bundle, over the lumen. [...] In both larval and regenerative development, a region of epidermal cells at the base of the terminal tentacle, commenced differentiation into the three classes of ocellar cells. This region then invaginated and the corneal components extended processes over the lumen, which gradually became filled with the apices of the sensory cells and their cilia and villi. Endocytosis of villous material was noted in the sensory cells in newly formed ocelli, and the polymorphic profiles of autophagocytosis were present in very early stages of pigmented cell differentiation. The small pigment granules appeared to arise from a granular material present in the cytoplasm, and apparently transported from the Golgi apparatus by vesicles. [...] The optic region thickened to become a pad of <b>tissue.</b> <b>Establishment</b> of this cushion and numerous ocelli occurred rapidly through regeneration, while the larvae, which developed optic pigmentation and an ocellus after the establishment of their third pairs of tube feet, maintained the single ocellar condition for an extended period of time...|$|E

The aim of the e-learning course was to enable the students to learn the theoretical principles of the subject individually and to present the gained knowledge at the final seminar. Methods: All functions of the course were operated in Moodle, local application of the Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Králové. The course was divided into 3 main topics corresponding with topics of lectures: 1. Principles of tissue and organ donation, 2. Low temperature preservation of cells, tissues and organs, 3. Quality and safety assurance in practice of tissue and procurement establishments. A test consisting of 5 questions selected randomly from the bank of questions followed each topic. If the student answers correctly at least 3 questions he is allowed to pass to the next topic. The fourth topic “Basic processes in the <b>tissue</b> <b>establishment</b> and principles of their validation” was added into the electronic version {{as a tool for}} repeating and improving of knowledge. The fifth topic was represented by a database for uploading theses presented by students at the final seminar. The final test consisted of 15 questions (5 ones from each basic topic). It was necessary to answer correctly at least 10 questions to receive a certificate of completing the course. Results: The course was put into operation during the summer term of the academic year 2012 / 2013. To the date 15 of September the total of 23 students enrolled (17, i. e. all students of the elective subject in the Czech version, 2 students of this subject in the English version, 2 postgraduate students and 2 medical doctors). All enrolled students used the course for on-line learning, downloading, or printing course study materials. All undergraduate students were obliged to use it for preparation, consultation and presentation of seminar theses, i. e. 10 minute Power Point presentations followed by 5 minute discussion.

40|$|Human oral {{epithelium}} is {{an established}} target for aldehyde toxicity, including from usage of tobacco, intake of foods and fluids, leaching of dental materials, and from mouth inhalation of aldehydes {{in the work}} environment. Following establishment of culture/exposure protocols for oral cell cultures, toxicity mechanisms and risk of malignant transformation from aldehyde exposure was investigated, including the metabolic defense offered by alcohol dehydrogenase 3 (ADH 3) against formaldehyde toxicity. Exposure of normal oral keratinocytes (NOK) and fibroblasts to formaldehyde demonstrated loss of viability in dose-dependent manners. The presence of fetal bovine serum as well as thiol and amino supplements influenced viability tip to 100 -fold as determined from colony formation and dye exclusion. Higher formaldehyde toxicity in fibroblasts was shown to correlate with comparatively lower intracellular levels of the free low-molecular-weight thiols glutathione and cysteine. Subsequent studies demonstrated distinct toxicity profiles of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and methylglyoxal in NOK and the SV 40 T antigenimmortalized human oral keratinocyte line SVpgC 2 a. Endogenous and induced acetaldehyde and methyIglyoxal DNA adducts was demonstrated by 32 P-postlabeling, including of endogenous origin and from treatment. Adducts were clearly formed in dose-dependent manners already at low toxicity, as assessed by dye exclusion. Transcripts, protein and enzyme activity for ADH 3 was then demonstrated in oral tissue specimens and various oral cell lines. Quantitative assessments of alcohol and aldehyde oxidizing activities, including Km-determinations, demonstrated that ADH 3 constitutes the primary metabolic defense against formaldehyde toxicity. Transcription of ADH 3 in tissue was confined to the basal cell layer of oral epithelium, whereas the resultant protein was highly stable, and expressed throughout the <b>tissue.</b> <b>Establishment</b> of protocols that permitted the selective induction of terminal differentiation of proliferative keratinocytes, demonstrated clearly the association of ADH 3 transcription with a proliferative state. Attempts of formaldehyde transformation from repeated exposures were successful in SVpgC 2 a, but not in NOK, including two cell lines followed for their life span. A resultant novel cell line, termed SVpgC 3 a, appeared from 40 exposures of SVpgC 2 a to genotoxic levels of formaldehyde. This line exhibited multi-focal growth and cloning in soft agar, albeit it did not induce tumors in the immuno-deficient host. Micro-array and twodimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated genetic changes at the transcript and protein levels, respectively, related to adhesion, cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and reactive oxygen detoxification. The current work elucidated the potential for adverse health effects of aldehydes in oral mucosa, including assessments of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, and as well, the cytoprotective effect offered from thiols and metabolism. The results indicate the cytoprotective function of both intracellular and extracellular thiols towards aldehyde toxicity, {{as well as the}} usefulness of thiol-free and chemically defined conditions for toxicity assessments in vitro. Analysis of ADH 3 expression demonstrates its role as a primary metabolic defense mechanism against formaldehyde. Transcription of ADH 3 serves as a marker of cell proliferation, whereas differential regulation of transcript and protein levels indicate that ADH 3 follows a novel expression principle hereto not demonstrated for the ADH family. From acting as a transforming agent, formaldehyde generated a novel cell line termed SvpgC 3 a that extends an existing battery of cell lines used to model oral cancer progression. Besides for exploring the etiology of oral cancer, such cell lines may serve as alternative models useful to safety assessment of chemicals and consumer products...|$|E

This article describes the potential of tissues that can be procured for transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sweden has 9. 7 million inhabitants, with an annual mortality rate of 90 000 and 5500 medicolegal autopsies per year. Cooperation between tissue banking and 2 DFMs began in the mid- 1980 s. Recently, cooperation has expanded to include all six DFMs. All <b>tissue</b> <b>establishments</b> (TEs) were asked to complete a questionnaire concerning their cooperation with DFMs from 2011 through 2013. RESULTS: A total of 298 actual donors were identified; 1090 tissues were procured including cardiovascular tissue, cornea, sclera, ear bones, and skin for transplantation. Of the tissues distributed, 553 were for transplantation and 72 for other medical purposes. Twenty-three percent of the tissues were discarded. Reasons for tissue rejection included deficient tissue quality (65 %), positive serology tests (9 %), positive bacteriology tests after decontamination procedures (7 %), technical errors (< 1 %), and other reasons (18 %). CONCLUSION: Nineteen percent of all tissues distributed for transplantation came from donors in DFMs. The cooperation between DFMs and TEs was described as well functioning and excellent. Education and national courses in tissue procurement for employees in DFMs are contributing factors to such positive interactions.

40|$|As {{indicated}} in published statistics, metastases account for 90 % of cancer-related deaths (Gupta and Massagué, 2006). Metastasis {{has always been}} a bottleneck in tumor prognosis and therapy. The invasive-metastatic cascade is a complex, multistep process that involves the escape of tumor cells from a primary carcinoma, followed by their intravasation into the systemic circula-tion, survival during transit through the vas-culature, extravasation into the parenchyma of distant <b>tissues,</b> <b>establishment</b> of micrometas-tases, and ultimately outgrowth of macroscopic secondary tumors (Fidler, 2003). Transcriptional expression studies have revealed that sets of genes whose expression profiles in primary tumors are correlated with metastatic relapse and poor survival can be used as prognostic signatures in cancer patients (Ye et al., 2003; Nevins and Potti, 2007). Some of these genes have been validated through functional and clinical studies as can-didate mediators of metastasis (Castellano et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2010). How-ever, few molecules have been implicated in multiple steps of metastatic cascades. Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are short, noncoding RNA molecules with 21 – 24 evo-lutionarily conserved nucleotides. These small cellular RNAs act as negative regulators of gene expression by binding to the complementary sequences in 3 untranslated regions (3 UTRs) of specific target mRNAs of protein-coding genes, leading to degradation of the target mRNAs, inhibition of their translation, or both (Ambros, 2004; Bartel, 2004, 2009). Deregulations of miRNAs have been linked to many human dis-eases, and the central role of miRNAs in the es-tablishment and progression of human tumors has begun to emerge (Voorhoeve et al., 2006...|$|R
40|$|Both {{autologous}} and allogeneic human organs, {{tissues and}} cells {{are used for}} a wide variety of medical applications. At the moment national legislation for safety and quality aspects of human tissue is under development in the Netherlands. One important safety aspect is the risk of infectious disease transmission. This can occur through infectious donors and by contamination of the human material during the whole transplantation process. The latter includes besides, transport, processing and storage, also the actual retrieval and implantation. Measures to control these risks should at least be based on scientific rationales, such as the prevalence of infectious disease agents among the donor population, and the mortality and morbidity associated with the diseases. The measures should preferably be based on international agreements, since international exchange is taking place for most human tissues. It is the responsibility of all those involved in the transplantation process to reduce the risk of disease transmission and to implement the relevant control measures. The latter could be achieved by the formulation of guidelines with recommendations, instructions and minimal requirements to support daily practice. Our inventory of guidelines has revealed that for most human tissues such guidelines are developed by (inter) national organisations. Non-tissue-specific guidelines focus mainly on the implementation of a quality system for <b>tissue</b> <b>establishments,</b> sometimes referred to as Good Tissue Practice (GTP). The GTP approach provides basic requirements for factors such as personnel, buildings, materials and documentation. In several guidelines these basic requirements are combined with detailed information on donor selection, storage and transport. In addition, tissue-specific guidelines in existence for several categories also focus in detail on donor selection and, in most cases, on detailed procedures during the whole transplantation process. This inventory could be used for standardisation activities in the framework of the new Dutch act on human tissues...|$|R

Thereafter the rate slowed progressively so that a steady concentration of phytochrome was approached at hour 7. Returning the plants to darkness resulted {{in an increase in}} phytochrome due to the apparent synthesis of PR. A closely similar pattern of changes was found in the amount of phytochrome extracted from the <b>tissue.</b> The <b>establishment</b> of the stable concentration was inhibited by 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and did not occur in segments which had been incubated for longer than 24 hours, but was observed when segment growth was inhibited by mannitol.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} report on medical errors {{published}} in 1999 by the US Institute of Medicine, {{a number of different}} approaches to risk management have been developed for maximum risk reduction in health care activities. The health care authorities in many countries have focused attention on patient safety, employing action research programs that are based on quite different principles. Materials and Methods: We performed a systematic Medline research of the literature since 1999. The following key words were used, also combining boolean operators and medical subheading terms: "adverse event," "risk management," "error," and "governance. " Studies published in the last 5 years were particularly classified in various groups: risk management in health care systems; safety in specific hospital activities; and health care institutions' official documents. Methods of action researches have been analysed and their characteristics compared. Their suitability for safety development in donation, retrieval, and transplantation processes were discussed in the reality of the Italian transplant network. Discussion: Some action researches and studies were dedicated to entire national healthcare systems, whereas others focused on specific risks. Many research programs have undergone critical review in the literature. Retrospective analysis has centered on so-called sentinel events to particularly analyze only a minor portion of the organizational phenomena, which can be the origin of an adverse event, an incident, or an error. Sentinel events give useful information if they are studied in highly engineered and standardized organizations like laboratories or <b>tissue</b> <b>establishments,</b> but they show several limits in the analysis of organ donation, retrieval, and transplantation processes, which are characterized by prevailing human factors, with high intrinsic risk and variability. Thus, they are poorly effective to deliver sure elements to base safety management improvement programs, especially regarding multidisciplinary systems with high complexity. Conclusion: In organ transplantation, the possibility to increase safety seems greater using proactive research, mainly centred on organizational processes together with retrospective analyses but not limited to sentinel event reports. © 2010...|$|R
40|$|Tissue {{patterning}} {{is established}} by extracellular growth factors or morphogens. Although different theoretical models explaining specific patterns have been proposed, {{our understanding of}} <b>tissue</b> pattern <b>establishment</b> in vivo remains limited. In many animal species, left-right patterning is governed by a reaction-diffusion system relying on the different diffusivity of an activator, Nodal, and an inhibitor, Lefty. In a genetic screen, we identified a zebrafish loss-of-function mutant for the proprotein convertase FurinA. Embryological and biochemical experiments demonstrate that cleavage of the Nodal-related Spaw proprotein into a mature form by FurinA is required for Spaw gradient formation and activation of Nodal signaling. We demonstrate that FurinA is required cell-autonomously for the long-range signaling activity of Spaw and no other Nodal-related factors. Combined in silico and in vivo approaches support a model in which FurinA controls the signaling range of Spaw by cleaving its proprotein into a mature, extracellular form, consequently regulating left-right patterning...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAlterations in estrogen-mediated {{cellular}} signaling play {{an essential}} role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. In addition to higher estrogen receptor (ER) β levels, enhanced ERβ activity was detected in endometriotic tissues, and the inhibition of enhanced ERβ activity by an ERβ-selective antagonist suppressed mouse ectopic lesion growth. Notably, gain of ERβ function stimulated the progression of endometriosis. As a mechanism to evade endogenous immune surveillance for cell survival, ERβ interacts with cellular apoptotic machinery in the cytoplasm to inhibit TNF-α-induced apoptosis. ERβ also interacts with components of the cytoplasmic inflammasome to increase interleukin- 1 β and thus enhance its cellular adhesion and proliferation properties. Furthermore, this gain of ERβ function enhances epithelial-mesenchymal transition signaling, thereby increasing the invasion activity of endometriotic <b>tissues</b> for <b>establishment</b> of ectopic lesions. Collectively, we reveal how endometrial tissue generated by retrograde menstruation can escape immune surveillance and develop into sustained ectopic lesions via gain of ERβ function...|$|R

In this study, {{infectious}} spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) was used to establish an infection in zebrafish, and the experimental conditions were established and characterized. Mortality of adult zebrafish infected with ISKNV by intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection exceeded 60 %. ISKNV can be passed stably in zebrafish for over ten passages. The ailing zebrafish displayed petechial hemorrhaging and scale protrusion. Histological analysis of moribund fish revealed necrosis of tissue and enlarged cells in kidney and spleen. The real-time RT-PCR analysis of mRNA level confirmed that ISKNV was replicated in zebrafish. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses further confirmed the presence of ISKNV-infected cells in almost all organs of the infected fish. Electron microscope analyses showed that the ISKNV particle was present in the infected <b>tissues.</b> The <b>establishment</b> of zebrafish infection model of ISKNV can offer a valuable tool for studying the interactions between ISKNV and its host...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are {{endogenous}} small noncoding RNAs {{that regulate}} gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Studies {{have shown that}} zebrafish miRNAs {{play a key role}} in embryo development, <b>tissue</b> fate <b>establishment,</b> and differentiation by interacting with specific targets, usually in the 3 ′UTR of the mRNA. Identification of the target sequence is fundamental to elucidating miRNA function. Since bioinformatics can predict hundreds of potential targets for each miRNA, experimental validation of the actual target site is required. Although recent studies have employed the HEK 293 cell line to investigate mammalian miRNA targets, our results have shown that the cell line is not suitable for studies of zebrafish miR- 430 b miRNA. In this article we describe a convenient in vitro assay system that involves the use of zebrafish cell cultures and a luciferase reporter construct to evaluate miR- 430 b target sites. The cell culture-based assay could be used to validate target sequences of other zebrafish miRNAs...|$|R
50|$|Multiplication is {{the taking}} of tissue samples {{produced}} during the first stage and increasing their number. Following the successful introduction and growth of plant <b>tissue,</b> the <b>establishment</b> stage is followed by multiplication. Through repeated cycles of this process, a single explant sample may be increased from one to hundreds and thousands of plants. Depending {{on the type of}} tissue grown, multiplication can involve different methods and media. If the plant material grown is callus tissue, it can be placed in a blender and cut into smaller pieces and recultured on the same type of culture medium to grow more callus tissue. If the tissue is grown as small plants called plantlets, hormones are often added that cause the plantlets to produce many small offshoots. After the formation of multiple shoots, these shoots are transferred to rooting medium with a high auxin\cytokinin ratio. After the development of roots, plantlets can be used for hardening.|$|R

However, an equally essential step in this process is the pruning of excessive blood vessels. Recent {{studies have shown that}} pruning is critical for the effective perfusion of blood into tissues. Despite its significance, vessel pruning is the least understood process in vascular differen-tiation and development. Two recently published PLOS Biology papers provide important new information about cellular dynamics of vascular regression. Vascular biology is a rapidly emerging field of research. Given the critical role the vasculature frequently plays {{in a wide range of}} common and serious diseases such as arteriosclerosis, ische-mic diseases, cancer, and chronic inflammatory diseases, a better understanding of the forma-tion, maintenance, and remodeling of blood vessels is of major importance.

40|$|Current {{applications}} of microarrays focus on precise classification or discovery of biological types, for example tumor versus normal phenotypes in cancer research. Several challenging scientific tasks in the post-genomic epoch, like hunting for the genes underlying complex diseases from genome-wide gene expression profiles and thereby building the corresponding gene networks, are largely overlooked {{because of the}} lack of an efficient analysis approach. We have thus developed an innovative ensemble decision approach, which can efficiently perform multiple gene mining tasks. An application of this approach to analyze two publicly available data sets (colon data and leukemia data) identified 20 highly significant colon cancer genes and 23 highly significant molecular signatures for refining the acute leukemia phenotype, most of which have been verified either by biological experiments or by alternative analysis approaches. Furthermore, the globally optimal gene subsets identified by the novel approach have so far achieved the highest accuracy for classification of colon cancer <b>tissue</b> types. <b>Establishment</b> of this analysis strategy has offered the promise of advancing microarray technology as a means of deciphering the involved genetic complexities of complex diseases...|$|R
