5|$|In the west, NY186 {{begins at}} NY30 in Harrietstown, near the eastern bank of Lake Clear. Known as Lake Clear Road, NY186 heads east-northeastward, {{crossing}} {{a pair of}} train tracks and later a creek. Situated within the forested terrain of the Adirondack State Park, the highway passes to the south of, and serves, the Adirondack Regional Airport. South of the airport NY186 intersects several local roads. The highway turns more towards the northeast upon passing the airport, and proceeds uneventfully. Subsequent <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> towards the east, NY186 terminates at NY86, still within Harrietstown.|$|E

5|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> onto Rutgers Street, CR-506 {{runs along}} Washington Street {{concurrent}} {{with the northern}} section of Route 7. Though the northern section of Route 7 begins a few blocks south, it is not readily recognized (minimal signing). As CR-506 runs concurrently with it here, and then turns down Rutgers for the short distance that bridges {{the gap between the}} two Route 7 sections, Rutgers/506 is often viewed as if it continues Route 7, while the short portion of the northern section that lies south of Rutgers is sometimes seen as a spur, even though {{it is part of the}} main route.|$|E
5|$|Risotto is a dish {{made using}} Italian short-grain rice, {{which is both}} highly {{absorbent}} and resistant <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> into a pudding when cooked with stock and flavoured with onions and garlic, cooked in butter. Anna Gosetti della Salda's book of Italian regional cookery lists 37 risotto recipes, 18 {{of them from the}} Veneto. Variations among Veneto risottos include additions of fish and white wine; chicken; eel; mushrooms and grated Parmesan cheese; quails; small pieces of beef; courgettes (zucchini); clams; ragù; beans; mussels; prawns; cuttlefish; and asparagus.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the Gulf of California, an eye began to become apparent on visible satellite imagery, {{and it is}} estimated Isis attained hurricane status late on September 2. Continuing northward, it struck Topolobampo {{in the state of}} Sinaloa early on September 3 as a minimal hurricane. Isis weakened to a tropical storm a few hours after landfall, and subsequent <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> to the north-northwest the low-level circulation dissipated over Sierra Madre Occidental. The remnants entered southern Arizona on September 4 and tracked around an upper-level low. After entering Nevada on September 5, the remnants of Isis passed into Oregon before dissipating in Idaho on September 8.|$|E
50|$|A higher {{steering}} ratio {{means that the}} steering wheel is <b>turned</b> more <b>to</b> get the wheels turning, {{but it will be}} easier <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the steering wheel. A lower {{steering ratio}} means that the steering wheel is <b>turned</b> less <b>to</b> get the wheels turning, but it will be harder <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the steering wheel. Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher steering ratio, which will make the steering wheel easier <b>to</b> <b>turn.</b> If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the steering wheel. In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier <b>to</b> <b>turn,</b> so the steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The steering wheel is therefore harder <b>to</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|R

5|$|DE 9 runs between {{farmland}} to {{the north}} and housing developments to the south prior <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> north onto Silver Run Road. The road curves northeast through agricultural areas before entering marshland and crossing the Appoquinimink River. After this, the route turns north to remain on Silver Run Road and passes through areas of farms, woods, and wetlands in the Augustine Wildlife Area a short distance {{to the west of the}} Delaware River. DE 9 turns east onto Bayview Road before turning north onto St. Augustine Road and following the west bank of the Delaware River. The road reaches the community of Port Penn, where it is lined with homes. In Port Penn, the route turns west onto Market Street before turning north onto Delaware City Port Penn Road near the Port Penn Interpretive Center.|$|E
5|$|From this point, {{the route}} {{continues}} east through dense woods prior <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> northeast into Liberty Township. The road {{passes through the}} community of Townsbury before crossing into Independence Township. Here, US 46 enters more agricultural areas and turns east again, with development increasing along the road as it passes through Great Meadows-Vienna. It continues southeast before entering Hackettstown, where the road becomes Main Street. In Hackettstown, the route crosses New Jersey Transit’s Morristown Line and Montclair-Boonton Line before coming to an intersection with CR 517. Here, CR 517 forms a concurrency with US 46, and the two routes continue southeast through the downtown area. At the intersection with the northern terminus of Route 182, CR 517 splits from US 46 by heading south on that route while US 46 continues to the east.|$|E
5|$|In Menominee County, the {{environment}} {{takes on a}} more agricultural character along US2. The highway passes through {{the edge of the}} community of Hermansville before entering Powers. US2 comes to a three-way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US41. The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and Spaulding {{on the south side of}} the CN Railway. At Harris, the trunkline enters the Hannahville Indian Community. Harris is on the Menominee County side of the reservation, but as the highway continues east, it crosses over to Bark River on the Delta County side. The county line in between not only separates the two communities, but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones. East of Bark River, the highway crosses the community's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M‑69. The roadway crosses the Ford River prior <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> due east into the outskirts of Escanaba.|$|E
2500|$|Often, the batsman is {{only allowed}} <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> face the next {{delivery}} if {{they hit the}} ball. If they miss and are not dismissed, they must attempt to play the next ball (which is bowled from where the ball ended up after the previous delivery) without being allowed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> face it. Sometimes additionally, if the batsman does not <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> face the ball before a fielder picks it up, they would have <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> their waist and face the fielder bowling in order to hit the ball.|$|R

5|$|Raven and NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zybysko were {{involved}} in a rivalry heading into Final Resolution. At Bound for Glory, Raven requested an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match but was denied by Zybysko. This led to Raven assaulting him before being ejected from the arena by security in the storyline. At Genesis, Zybysko offered Raven the chance to be released from his contract, as this was what Zybysko wanted in the storyline. Raven declined the offer and tried to attack Zybysko once again. Instead, Zybysko forced Raven to face P.J. Polaco in a match, which Raven won. This led <b>to</b> <b>Turning</b> Point where Raven once again declined an offer to be released. Zybysko then revealed Chris K as Raven's opponent for the night; Raven was victorious in the encounter. On the December17, 2005 episode of Impact!, Zybysko announced that at Final Resolution Raven would have another opponent and if he won the bout then he gained a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match.|$|E
5|$|Shooting of the {{two films}} was marred by Donner's bad {{relationship}} with the Salkinds, with Richard Lester acting as mediator. With the film going over-budget, the filmmakers decided to temporarily cease production of II and move that film's climax into the first film. Despite Supermans success, Donner {{did not return to}} finish Superman II, and it was completed with Lester, who gave the film a more tongue-in-cheek tone. The Salkinds also cut Brando for financial reasons, while John Williams quit as composer due <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> his attention to other projects. Superman II was another financial and critical success, despite stiff competition with Raiders of the Lost Ark in the same year. In 2006, after receiving many requests for his own version of Superman II, Richard Donner and producer Michael Thau produced their own cut of the film and released it on November 28, 2006. The new version of the film received positive response from critics and the stars of the original film.|$|E
5|$|The route briefly {{forms the}} border between the borough of Hatboro to the east and Upper Moreland Township to the west before fully {{entering}} Hatboro past the Newington Drive intersection. Here, PA 263 heads north prior <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> northeast and intersecting Horsham Road. At this point, the route crosses the Pennypack Creek and heads into downtown Hatboro as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane. The route turns north at Byberry Road and becomes North York Road at the Moreland Avenue intersection before it comes to a junction with the western terminus of PA 332 (East Montgomery Avenue). After passing Summit Avenue, PA 263 leaves the downtown area and becomes a four-lane undivided road again, passing residential areas with a few businesses. Through Hatboro, PA 263 is also called the Roy W. Cornell Memorial Highway.|$|E
2500|$|The court {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that Cho's steering led the ship to attempt a 15 degree turn for 40 seconds. The court concluded that Cho, who was flustered by the ship turning faster than expected when he was following Park's order <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> 145 degrees, was attempting <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the left when he took Park's order <b>to</b> mean a <b>turn</b> in the opposite direction.

Prisoners were moved to a new metropolitan maximum security prison at Casuarina and the prison was transferred to the Building Management Authority. There were divergent views in the community over the site's future: some wanted it demolished and redeveloped, or turned into gardens with a small monument; others wanted the historic site to be preserved, but were opposed <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> the misery of prisoners into entertainment for tourists. The ultimate decision was for conservation of the prison, but allowing for the buildings to be adapted for reuse by the community.|$|E
5|$|Leading up <b>to</b> <b>Turning</b> Point 2007, TNA {{officials}} {{began to}} suspect Scott Hall would not {{show up at the}} event, as the last contact with him prior to the event was earlier that morning. TNA officials soon received word from Hall that he was suffering from food poisoning and {{would not be able to}} attend. As a result of the no-show, officials approached Samoa Joe and asked him to help take blame off the company for Hall's no-show and to help promote talent in TNA by giving an announcement before introducing Eric Young as Hall's replacement. Joe's announcement went five minutes longer than originally planned, which upset several individuals in TNA. At one point during his announcement, he asked a person off-screen if they were angry and to go ahead and fire him, as he did not care; this individual was the legitimate president of TNA, Dixie Carter. After the event went off the air, a heated exchange between Kevin Nash and Joe took place backstage. The next night, TNA held a meeting and announced that anyone unhappy with their job could void their contract with the company. Senshi was the only one who wished to void his contract. During the meeting, Joe apologized for his actions at the event.|$|E
