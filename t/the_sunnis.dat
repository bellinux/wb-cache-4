5|$|Like {{many of his}} contemporaries, he {{does not}} seem to have felt that his admiration for the pre-Islamic Iranian civilization {{conflicted}} with his Muslim Shiite faith. According to some accounts, he repaired the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala, and built a mausoleum of Ali in Najaf, which is today known as the Imam Ali Mosque. He is said to have been generous to a prominent Shiite theologian, but did not follow a Shiite religious policy and was tolerant to <b>the</b> <b>Sunnis.</b> He even tried to get closer to <b>the</b> <b>Sunnis</b> by giving his daughter in marriage to the caliph, which was a failure because the caliph refused to consummate the marriage.|$|E

Zilmer said that he agreed with the assessment, but added that his mission was only to train Iraqi security forces. He added {{that if he were}} asked to achieve a wider objective he would need more forces, but that sending more Americans to Anbar would not pacify the province—that the only path to victory was for <b>the</b> <b>Sunnis</b> to accept the Government of Iraq.|$|E

25|$|The Safavid {{experience}} largely {{created the}} clear line of political demarcation and hostility between Twelver Shiism and Sunnism, even though doctrinal differences {{had long been}} recognized. Before the Safavids the Twelvers for many centuries had mostly accommodated themselves politically to <b>the</b> <b>Sunnis,</b> and numerous religious movements combined Twelver and Sunni ideas.|$|E
25|$|Sunnis {{have accused}} Alevis of heresy, heterodoxy, rebellion, {{betrayal}} and immorality. Alevis, {{on the other}} hand, {{have argued that the}} Quran does not demand five prayers, nor mosque attendance, nor pilgrimage, and that <b>the</b> <b>Sunnis</b> distorted early Islam by omitting, misinterpreting, or changing the meaning of verses from the Quran with fabricated hadith, especially those dealing with Ali and ritual practice.|$|E

25|$|The Buyids rarely {{attempted}} {{to enforce a}} particular religious view upon their subjects except when in matters {{where it would be}} politically expedient. The Sunni Abbasids retained the caliphate but were deprived of all secular power. In addition, in order to prevent tensions between the Shia and <b>the</b> <b>Sunnis</b> from spreading to government agencies, the Buyid amirs occasionally appointed Christians to high offices instead of Muslims from either sect.|$|E
25|$|Shiism did {{not become}} fully {{established}} until the reign of Abbas I of Persia (1587–1629). Abbas hated <b>the</b> <b>Sunnis,</b> and forced the population to accept Twelver Shiism. Thus by 1602 most of the formerly Sunnis of Iran had accepted Shiism. A significant number, however, did not accept Safavid rule, prompting Abbas to institute a number of administrative changes {{in order to further}} transform Iran into a Twelver Shia state.|$|E
25|$|The Imamate of the Shia {{encompasses}} {{far more}} of a prophetic function than the Caliphate of <b>the</b> <b>Sunnis.</b> Unlike Sunni, Shias believe special spiritual qualities have been granted not only to Muhammad but also to Ali and the other Imams. Twelvers believe the imams are immaculate from sin and human error (ma'sūm), and can understand and interpret the hidden inner meaning of the teachings of Islam. In this way the Imams are trustees (wasi) who bear the light of Muhammad (Nūr Muhammadin).|$|E
50|$|The last census in Lebanon in 1932 put <b>the</b> {{numbers of}} <b>Sunnis</b> at 22% of the {{population}} (178,100 of 791,700). A study done by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1985 put <b>the</b> numbers of <b>Sunnis</b> at 27% {{of the population}} (595,000 of 2,228,000).|$|R

Erwadi in Ramanathapuram district and Nagore in Nagapattinam district are important pilgrimage sites for Muslims. Kazimar Big Mosque in Madurai and Karpudaiyar masjid in Kayalpatnam are among the earlier mosques in Tamil Nadu.|$|E
25|$|When {{he came to}} power, Assad {{organised}} state services along sectarian lines (<b>the</b> <b>Sunnis</b> {{became the}} heads of political institutions, while the Alawites {{took control of the}} military, intelligence, and security apparatuses). The formerly collegial powers of Ba'athist decision-making were curtailed, and were transferred to the Syrian presidency. The Syrian government ceased to be a one-party system in the normal sense of the word, and was turned into a one-party state with a strong presidency. To maintain this system, a cult of personality centered on Assad and his family was created.|$|E
25|$|During {{the reign}} of Sultan Husayn (r. 1694–1722) (the last {{effective}} Safavid Shah), {{there was a lot}} of religious unrest and religiously motivated rebellions in the Safavid state. Amongst the foreign interests, decades of misrule by incapable Shah's, and tireless wars against the Safavid's arch rival, the Ottoman Turks, and new imperial rival, Russia, that wrecked the Safavid state and made it decline. The religious unrest and rebellions were especially provoked by his ill-fated persecution of <b>the</b> <b>Sunnis</b> living under his control. These troubles contributed to the further destabilization of the Safavid empire (towards the final years of its existence) and were factors that contributed in bringing the Safavids into an existential crisis.|$|E

25|$|Acts of {{violence}} involving Sunni Muslims and their Shia counterparts in Pakistan have been evident since the 1980s. They are {{generally considered to}} have arisen from attempts by the then national leader, Zia ul-Haq, to legitimise his military dictatorship and from the influx of weapons into the country following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Although the perpetrators often do not claim responsibility for the attacks, expert analysis suggests that in recent times it is <b>the</b> <b>Sunnis</b> who are dominating the aggression {{and that they are}} motivated by the ideology of Al-Qaeda. The number of violent incidents has been increasing in recent years, although not all of them are classified by the police as being sectarian attacks.|$|E
25|$|Their {{presence}} is controversial, and resisted by {{large segments of}} the Christian population, who argue that the primarily Sunni Muslim Palestinians dilute Christian numbers. Many Shia Muslims also look unfavorably upon the Palestinian presence since the refugee camps have tended to be concentrated in their home areas. The Lebanese Sunnis, however, would be happy to see these Palestinians given the Lebanese nationality, thus increasing the Lebanese Sunni population by well over 10% and tipping the fragile electoral balance much in favor of <b>the</b> <b>Sunnis.</b> Late prime minister Rafiq Hariri —himself a Sunni— had hinted {{on more than one occasion}} on the inevitability of granting these refugees Lebanese citizenship. Thus far the refugees are Lebanese citizenship as well as many rights enjoyed by the rest of the population, and are confined to severely overcrowded refugee camps, in which construction rights are severely constricted.|$|E
25|$|For unclear reasons, the {{treatment}} of homosexuality in Twelver Shia jurisprudence is generally harsher than in Sunni fiqh, while Zaydi and Isma'ili Shia jurists took positions similar to <b>the</b> <b>Sunnis.</b> Where flogging is prescribed, {{there is a tendency}} for indulgence and some recommend that the prescribed penalty should not be applied in full, with Ibn Hazm reducing the number of strokes to 10. There was debate as to whether the active and passive partners in anal sex should be punished equally. Beyond penetrative anal sex, there was “general agreement” that “other homosexual acts (including any between females) were lesser offenses, subject only to discretionary punishment.” Some jurists viewed sexual intercourse as possible only for an individual who possesses a phallus; hence those definitions of sexual intercourse that rely on the entry of as little of the corona of the phallus into a partner's orifice. Since women do not possess a phallus and cannot have intercourse with one another, they are, in this interpretation, physically incapable of committing zinā.|$|E

25|$|The Shihabs succeeded the Maans in 1697 {{after the}} Battle of Ain Dara, {{a battle that}} {{changed the face of}} Lebanon back then, where a clash between two Druze clans broke up: the Qaysis and the Yemenis. The Druze Qaysis, led back then by Ahmad Shihab, won and {{expelled}} the Yemenis from Lebanon to Syria. This has led to an enormous decrease to the Druze population in Mount-Lebanon, who were a majority back then and helped the Christians overcome the Druze demographically. This Qaysi 'victory' gave the Shihab, who were Qaysis themselves and the allies of Lebanon, the rule over Mount-Lebanon. The Druze overlords voted for the Shihabs to rule Mount Lebanon and the Chouf by the threat of the Ottoman Empire who wanted <b>the</b> <b>Sunnis</b> to rule Lebanon. The Shihabs originally lived in the Hawran region of southwestern Syria and settled in Wadi al-Taym in southern Lebanon. The most prominent among them was Bashir Shihab II. His ability as a statesman was first tested in 1799, when Napoleon besieged Acre, a well-fortified coastal city in Palestine, about forty kilometers south of Tyre. Both Napoleon and Al Jazzar, the governor of Acre, requested assistance from the Shihab leader; Bashir, however, remained neutral, declining to assist either combatant. Unable to conquer Acre, Napoleon returned to Egypt, and the death of Al Jazzar in 1804 removed Bashir's principal opponent in the area. The Shihabs were originally a Sunni Muslim family, but had converted to Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Following Tughtakin's {{death in}} 1128, his son, Taj al-Din Buri, became the nominal ruler of Damascus. Coincidentally, the Seljuq prince of Mosul, Imad al-Din Zengi, took power in Aleppo and gained a mandate from the Abbasids {{to extend his}} {{authority}} to Damascus. In 1129, around 6,000 Isma'ili Muslims {{were killed in the}} city along with their leaders. <b>The</b> <b>Sunnis</b> were provoked by rumors alleging there was a plot by the Isma'ilis, who controlled the strategic fort at Banias, to aid the Crusaders in capturing Damascus in return for control of Tyre. Soon after the massacre, the Crusaders aimed {{to take advantage of the}} unstable situation and launch an assault against Damascus with nearly 60,000 troops. However, Buri allied with Zengi and managed to prevent their army from reaching the city. Buri was assassinated by Isma'ili agents in 1132; he was succeeded by his son, Shams al-Mulk Isma'il who ruled tyrannically until he himself was murdered in 1135 on secret orders from his mother, Safwat al-Mulk Zumurrud; Isma'il's brother, Shihab al-Din Mahmud, replaced him. Meanwhile, Zengi, intent on putting Damascus under his control, married Safwat al-Mulk in 1138. Mahmud's reign then ended in 1139 after he was killed for relatively unknown reasons by members of his family. Mu'in al-Din Unur, his mamluk ("slave soldier") took effective power of the city, prompting Zengi—with Safwat al-Mulk's backing—to lay siege against Damascus the same year. In response, Damascus allied with the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem to resist Zengi's forces. Consequently, Zengi withdrew his army and focused on campaigns against northern Syria.|$|E
500|$|On 16 May 2003, the CPA issued Order Number 1, which {{abolished}} the Ba'ath Party {{and began a}} process of [...] "de-Ba'athification", and on 23 May 2003 issued Order Number 2, which disbanded the Iraqi Army and other security services. Both orders further antagonized <b>the</b> <b>Sunnis</b> of Anbar. Many Sunnis took great pride in the Iraqi Army and viewed its disbanding {{as an act of}} contempt towards the Iraqi people. The dissolution also put hundreds of thousands of Anbaris out of work as many were members of the Army or the party. [...] Three days after CPA Order No. 2, Major Matthew Schram became the first American killed since the invasion in Anbar Province when his convoy came under rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) attack on 26 May near Haditha.|$|E
