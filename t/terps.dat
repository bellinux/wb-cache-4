5|$|The {{following}} season, Maryland {{earned a}} number-two seeding after defeating Hopkins, 12–9. The teams met {{again in the}} tournament quarterfinals, where, playing at home, Hopkins gained a 7–0 lead against heavily favored Maryland. The Terrapins rallied, but the Blue Jays held them off to preserve victory, 9–7. In 1998 at Homewood Field, Hopkins upset first-ranked Maryland, 10–6 during the regular season. This time when they met in the tournament quarterfinals, Maryland had the homefield advantage at Byrd Stadium. The <b>Terps</b> led 10–6 {{in the fourth quarter}} before the Blue Jays rallied to force overtime. Maryland, however, won the ensuing faceoff and scored after several shots on goal, never allowing Hopkins to gain possession of the ball. The <b>Terps</b> eventually advanced to the final, where they were defeated by Princeton.|$|E
5|$|Between 1947 and 1955, Jim Tatum led the <b>Terps</b> to two {{national}} championships, two ACC championships, a Southern Conference championship, and five bowl game appearances. In 1952, Maryland quarterback Jack Scarbath was the runner-up to the Heisman Trophy, which is awarded to college football's most outstanding player. The next year, coach Tatum {{led the team}} through an undefeated regular season. This resulted in Maryland being awarded the 1953 National Championship.|$|E

5|$|The Terrapins, with {{a perfect}} ACC record, were named conference co-champions {{alongside}} Duke {{for the second consecutive}} year. Maryland possessed a perfect regular season record and ranked third in the nation behind Michigan State (8–1). The <b>Terps</b> secured an Orange Bowl rematch against first-ranked Oklahoma and a chance to avenge their defeat in 1953. However, the Sooners beat them again, 20–6, and they finished the postseason with a 10–1 record.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{lopsided}} {{start in the}} early 20th century, the <b>Terps</b> and Midshipmen were evenly matched {{for most of the}} history of the series. Between 1931 and 1965, Navy won six and Maryland five games. In the 2005 season opener, Navy was coming off one of its best seasons in history with a 10–2 record the previous year. Maryland struggled later in 2005, but proved a competitive match for Navy and achieved a last-minute win, 23–20.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Johns Hopkins {{narrowly}} retained an undefeated {{regular season}} by winning four one-goal games, which included an edging of Maryland, 16–15.

5|$|In Week 9, after {{defeating}} Wake Forest {{to improve}} to a 6–1 record, Maryland was ranked 25th {{by both the}} Associated Press and the Coaches' Polls. It {{was the first time}} the team was ranked since Week 11 in 2006. Maryland would rise in the polls, and enter the Harris and BCS rankings after beating NC State the following week. However, after the loss to Virginia Tech, the <b>Terps</b> fell out of the rankings altogether. Maryland made one final poll appearance after the win over North Carolina, before losing to Florida State.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} postseason, Maryland {{declined}} {{an invitation to}} face Navy in the Meineke Car Care Bowl in Charlotte, North Carolina. Instead, the <b>Terps</b> had their sights on the Champs Sports Bowl, to play Purdue in Orlando. According to Maryland athletic director Deborah Yow and coach Friedgen, the decision {{was based on the}} players' preference, a bigger school pay-out, warmer weather, a Big Ten opponent, and more media exposure. Also, the Champs Sports Bowl was deemed to be the fourth-most prestigious non-BCS bowl while the Meineke game was number-six.|$|E
5|$|In week 12 of the 2008 season, Maryland {{possessed a}} 7–3 record and stood atop the ACC Atlantic Division. However, the <b>Terps</b> lost their final two regular season games and slid to a four-way tie for {{third place in}} the division. Earlier in the season, Maryland {{defeated}} four ranked opponents, a feat surpassed only by the two teams that played in the BCS National Championship Game, Florida and Oklahoma—and those each played an extra game with their conference championships.

In this study we used the somatolactotroph cell line, GH 3 cells, to examine 1) the expression of ER�, <b>TERP,</b> or ER � and their regulation by estradiol; 2) the presence of receptor proteins; and 3) the effects of overexpressing ER � or <b>TERP</b> on estrogen induction of the PRL gene and activation of the estrogen response element (ERE). Incubation of GH 3 cells with estradiol (0. 1 – 10 nM) produced dosedependent increases in messenger RNA levels of ER � and <b>TERP,</b> but not ER�, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR.

5|$|Nevada and Maryland then {{exchanged}} punts three times, and the Wolf Pack punted it away {{a fourth}} time. In {{the span of}} two series, Kaepernick was sacked three times, once each by linebackers Dave Philistin, Alex Wujciak, and Adrian Moten. As a result, Kaepernick suffered an ankle sprain and played {{the rest of the}} game, but he noticeably favored his uninjured side. The <b>Terps</b> took over on their 47-yard line with 0:29 remaining in the half. Turner completed an eight-yard pass to Ronnie Tyler, and a Nevada hit out-of-bounds resulted in a 15-yard penalty against Nevada and a first down for Maryland. After two incomplete passes, Turner then converted on third down again with a toss to Tyler for 16yards and then once more for 14yards and a touchdown to bring the score to 26–14 in Maryland's favor. The <b>Terps</b> elected to attempt a two-point conversion, and Turner completed a pass to a wide-open Meggett in {{the right side of the}} end zone. With six seconds remaining in the first half, Maryland had a 28–14 lead. Nevada received Maryland's kickoff, but elected to run out the clock and head into halftime.|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} kickoff, Egekeze {{attempted}} {{to kick the}} ball as it fell off the tee. This resulted in an unintentional squib that was returned 36yards to the Terps' nine-yard line. Nevada's Kaepernick attempted to rush but was stopped for no gain. On the next play, he threw {{the ball into the}} end zone, but it was intercepted by Maryland safety Kenny Tate, resulting in a touchback. The <b>Terps</b> started on their own 20-yard line, and running back Davin Meggett rushed for 13yards and a first down. Turner then linked up with freshman receiver Ronnie Tyler for another first down at the Maryland 49-yard line. After a false start penalty, the <b>Terps</b> were unable to gain a first down and punted the ball away. The ball rolled into the end zone for a touchback, and Nevada started the final drive of the quarter at its 20-yard line. Kaepernick then passed for two first downs, picked up another due to a pass interference call against Maryland, and scrambled for yet another. He then handed off to Taua, who rushed 17yards for a touchdown. Nevada re-took the lead, 14–13, with 46 seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E

The following year, the teams met and played each season through 2009, but did not play again until 2015. As of the last meeting between the teams in 2017, the Maryland women held a perfect record against Hopkins, having won all 15 meetings by a combined margin of 248–125.|$|E

5|$|The teams {{met again}} in 1950 when Navy had a last-minute opening in its schedule. The Terrapins won three {{consecutive}} games from 1950 to 1952, and the Midshipmen won three from 1958 to 1963. During the 1964 game, a Maryland player twice flashed an obscene gesture, which prompted Navy {{to cancel the}} series again. After contractual obligations were fulfilled with the following year's game, the series was put on hiatus for 40 years. Maryland and Navy finally resumed the rivalry in 2005 and again in 2010, with the <b>Terps</b> winning both contests.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the {{two teams}} won a {{combined}} six national championships, with Maryland dominating {{the first part of}} the decade and Johns Hopkins the latter. Between 1951 and 1956, Maryland posted a 5–0–1 record against Hopkins, with three games won by at least six points. The <b>Terps</b> won consecutive national titles in 1955 and 1956, while posting a combined record of 21–0. In 1957, the Blue Jays snapped the Terrapins' 31-game winning streak with an upset win, 15–10. Two years later, both teams shared the national title with Army. Between 1955 and 1959, Maryland compiled a 48–3 record, with all three losses at the hands of Johns Hopkins.|$|E
5|$|The {{second day}} of the tournament began with the Maryland Terrapins facing the seventh-seeded Notre Dame Fighting Irish at home in South Bend, Indiana. The Fighting Irish entered the game in {{possession}} of a perfect 15–0 record, but still considered an unknown variable due to their schedule. The magazine Inside Lacrosse called the Terrapins a talented team that had underachieved during the regular season. The first-ranked Notre Dame defense frustrated Maryland, but the <b>Terps</b> still managed to gain a 6–1 lead in the third quarter. Maryland's defense effectively shut-down Notre Dame and the leading Irish scorer Ryan Hoff was unable to make a single shot on goal. Maryland was the only unseeded team to advance to the quarterfinals.|$|E

5|$|In Miami, first-ranked Maryland {{faced the}} team Tatum had coached {{prior to his}} arrival at College Park: fourth-ranked Oklahoma under former {{assistant}} Bud Wilkinson. The Sooners handed Maryland their only defeat, 0–7, but—as had happened in 1951 to the Terrapins' detriment—the final rankings were released before the bowls, and {{for the third time}} in four years, AP's national champion was defeated in their postseason game. However, unlike Tennessee, who retained their top-rank despite losing to Maryland in 1951, the Terrapins (10–1–0) did indeed finish with the best record, better than the Orange Bowl victor, Oklahoma (9–1–1). Maryland ranked first nationally in terms of rushing defense (83.9 yards allowed per game) and scoring defense (3.1 points allowed per game). At the same time, the <b>Terps</b> scored a record combined total of 298 points, a number not exceeded until 1967.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, many Maryland {{players have}} {{received}} All-American honors. Eleven <b>Terps</b> {{have been named}} consensus (received a majority of votes) first-team All-Americans and one, E.J. Henderson, has received that honor twice. Additionally, some have been awarded prestigious awards, including the Bednarik Award, Butkus Award, Lou Groza Award, Outland Trophy, and Lombardi Award. While no Terrapin has ever received the Heisman Trophy, which is bestowed upon college football's most outstanding player, several have received votes by the award's selection committee. Quarterbacks Jack Scarbath and Bernie Faloney finished second and fourth in the voting in 1952 and 1953, respectively. Additionally, Bob Pellegrini, Gary Collins, Randy White, and Boomer Esiason all finished in the top-ten of the voting for a Heisman. Six Maryland players and four coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Bear Bryant, Jerry Claiborne, Clark Shaughnessy, and Jim Tatum were inducted as coaches.

5|$|The 2005 {{game was}} played at the M Bank Stadium in Baltimore and {{attended}} by 67,809 fans. The game was a close contest marked by costly Maryland turnovers and Navy penalties. A Sam Hollenbach interception helped Navy to end the first quarter with a 14–3 lead. Immediately before halftime, Maryland kicked a field goal and another third-quarter field goal narrowed the deficit to 14–9. Both Maryland and Navy rushed for touchdowns and failed to make two-point conversions in the final quarter. Maryland took over on their own 18-yard line after the Navy kick, trailing 20–15 with 4:37 left on the clock. Hollenbach then engineered a 12-play, 82-yard drive capped by an 11-yard touchdown pass and a two-point conversion. Navy took over with one minute left, and completed a first down on their 33-yard line before an interception sealed the game for the <b>Terps</b> 23–20.|$|E
