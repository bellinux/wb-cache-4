40|$|The {{influence}} of nitrogen compounds in grape musts {{on the content}} of sulphur compounds of wines was studied. Different vinifications were performed with the addition of methionine (20 mg l− 1) and/or cysteine (40 mg l− 1) to grape musts before alcoholic fermentation. Six grape musts, with different nitrogen composition, from cultivars of the ‘Vinhos Verdes’ Region, in Portugal, were used. Addition of methionine to grape musts enhanced the content of wines in 3 -(methylthio) - 1 -propanol, acetic acid- 3 -(methylthio) propyl ester, 3 -(methylthio) propionic acid and some unidentified sulphur compounds. Increase of cysteine concentration in musts led to the production of wines with high levels of hydrogen sulphide and cis- 2 -methyltetrahydrothiophene- 3 -OL and also unidentified sulphur compounds; however, the content of 3 -(methylthio) propionic acid in the wines decreased considerately with the addition of cysteine to grape musts. This work showed that cultivars from the Vinho Verde Region show different sulphur compound contents. Avesso wines, elaborated from grape musts with low amino acids level, presented the highest <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> content. Wines from Azal branco and Alvarinho were characterised by high contents of 4 -(methylthio) - 1 -butanol and 3 -(methylthio) propionic acid, respectively. A high content of N-(3 -(methylthio) propyl) -acetamide and dimethylsulphone characterise the Loureiro wines. In contrast, Trajadura wines, produced from a must rich in amino acids, presented a low <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> content; however, these wines were also characterised by high concentrations of 4 -(methylthio) - 1 -butanol, acetic acid- 3 -(methylthio) propyl ester and hydrogen sulphide...|$|E

Fried cheese was produced under commercial conditions from acid tvarog ripened and fried with no butter added (non-fat) and with an addition of butter at 4 : 1 (reference cheese). Cheese was evaluated immediately after production and after 6 weeks of storage at 4 °C. Total and casein nitrogen, water and fat were assayed in cheese. Sensory analyses of cheese descriptors were conducted by profiling on a 0 – 10 scale, while volatiles were isolated by solid phase microextraction (SPME) technique. The dominant aroma in reference cheese was cowy/phenolic and cooked, while in non-fat cheese it was cooked and free fatty acid. Sulphur aroma was least perceptible in reference and non-fat cheese. After 6 -week storage the only significant changes were weakened cooked aroma in non-fat cheese and waxy/crayon aroma in reference cheese. Differences in profile analysis of full and non-fat cheese were reflected in amounts of determined volatiles, especially <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds,</b> acids, methyl ketones, terpenes and esters...|$|E
40|$|Sulphur {{determination}} is {{of priority}} in coal investigations {{due to its}} associated environmental pollution. There are generally various forms of sulphur in coal such as organic and inorganic forms both of which need to be characterized. However, it is the organic sulphur present in coal that is not well understood and studied. In this work, total and various forms of sulphur {{have been identified in}} raw coal samples from Camden, Majuba, Lethabo, Kriel, Duvha and Thuthuka power stations in South Africa. Organic sulphur compounds (2 - methyl thiophene, 3 -methyl thiophene, 2 -ethyl thiophene and dibenzothiophene) were characterized from these coal samples {{in order to determine the}} quality of South African coal. Organic sulphur compounds were extracted from coal samples by means of ultrasonic bath. The extraction of organic sulphur compounds was first optimised by using various organic solvents such as dichloromethane, toluene and hexane followed by quantification using gas chromatography with a flame ionisation detector. The extraction time was also optimized from 0 to 75 minutes while spiked standard concentrations were varied from 1700 to 17000 mg kg- 1 to control the process. Ultrasonic extracts were analyzed by GC equipped with SPB- 1 Sulphur column and flame ionisation detector. Microwave assisted extraction was used to extract various forms of sulphur in coal. During sequential extraction, sulphate and pyrite sulphur were extracted from coal samples using hydrochloric acid and nitric acid respectively. Total organic or total sulphur and selected metals in coal were extracted by means of a mixture of concentrated hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid and boric acid. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy allowed the analysis of all total and other inorganic sulphur forms as well as selected metals from Microwave assisted extraction system after calibration set with standards. <b>Total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> and other sulphur forms were also determined using elemental analyzer for carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur (CHNS). The standard calibration for CHNS determination was assessed by the use of Sulfamethazine, a certified reference material. 2 -methyl thiophene, 3 -methyl thiophene, 2 -ethyl thiophene and dibenzothiophene were identified in coal samples. The organic sulphur compounds found in most coal samples were methyl thiophenes.

30|$|The data {{available}} shows {{that during the}} desulphurization of lignite the <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> content can be reduced, on average, only by 3.0  wt% (Table  7).

These regulations place many challenges for the refining industry. Lower sulphur levels are being recommended for gasoline and diesel for environmental reasons. New methods and innovations are required to further reduce the sulphur level in liquid fuels. Separation process design to accomplish the removal of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> requires knowledge of the vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> with hydrocarbons, particularly their activity coefficients at infinite dilution. However, the investigations concerning the systems containing <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> are very limited. This thesis deals with the VLE measurements of selected <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> (1 -propanethiol, diethyl sulphide, and thiophene) with various hydrocarbons (C 6 to C 8) and 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane (ETBE) under isobaric and isothermal conditions, using a circulation still and the infinite dilutions activity coefficients measurements of 1 -propanethiol, ethyl methyl sulphide, and thiophene in toluene, n-heptane, and 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane at 90  kPa using comparative ebulliometer techniques. The gamma-phi approach {{was used in the}} calculation of VLE. The activity coefficients of the liquid phase (γ) were correlated with the Wilson model. The Wilson model gave a good correlation for all systems. The activity coefficients at infinite dilution (γ∞) were extrapolated from the VLE measurements with the Wilson model. The γ∞ values of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> for the systems thiophene + toluene and thiophene + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane obtained from the recirculation still measurements are compared with the γ∞ values of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> obtained from the comparative ebulliometer measurements. The agreement between the measurements is good. All the measured γ∞ of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in hydrocarbons are less than two. 1 -Propanethiol, thiophene, and diethyl sulphide in toluene show nearly ideal behaviour, and thus the γ∞ of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> for these systems are one. The activity coefficients of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in hydrocarbons show the typical behaviour of positive deviations from Raoult's law, which become smaller with increasing temperature and with {{an increase in the number}} of C-atoms of the alkanes. The systems 1 -propanethiol, thiophene, and diethyl sulphide in toluene show nearly ideal behaviour. No azeotrope formation was observed for the systems thiophene + 1 -hexene and diethyl sulphide + 1 -hexene. The reaction between 1 -propanethiol and 1 -hexene was observed. The systems thiophene + n-hexane and thiophene + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane, as well as the systems diethyl sulphide + n-heptane and diethyl sulphide + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane, show positive deviations from Raoult's law. These systems exhibit maximum pressure azeotropy. The systems thiophene + 1 -hexene and thiophene + 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane, as well as the systems diethyl sulphide with n-hexane, 1 -hexene, cyclohexane, and 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane, show positive deviation and strong nonideality. No azeotropes formed in these systems. The original UNIFAC predictive model is adequate to describe the behaviour of sulphur in hydrocarbons, even though its application is limited to the availability of the functional group interaction parameters. COSMO-RS gives poor prediction for all the systems studied, and thus it is not currently a suitable model for predicting the behaviour of systems containing <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> These new consistent measurements can be used to improve and develop thermodynamic models in dilute systems, and thus the behaviour of organic <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in the distillation of hydrocarbons can be simulated. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. {{was exposed}} to various {{concentrations}} of SO 2 during almost the entire life cycle. No negative effects of SO 2 on shoot biomass production were observed. There was a linear relation between the deposition of SO 2 and the atmospheric SO 2 concentration. Sulphur accumulated substantially in the shoots upon SO 2 exposure. SO 2 was either oxidized to sulphate or converted into extra organic <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in a sulphate to organic sulphur ratio of 3 : 1 :, independently of the atmospheric SO 2 concentration. Exposure to SO 2 resulted {{in an increase in}} water soluble non-protein sulphydryl content and a slight increase in the amount of glucosinolates, but both of these play a minor role as sinks for the excess sulphur. The ratio of total nitrogen to <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> decreased upon SO 2 exposure {{as a result of the}} increased sulphate content. The organic nitrogen to organic sulphur ratio did not change upon SO 2 exposure, indicating no changes in the composition of sulphur-containing compounds...|$|R
40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} enzyme rhodanese (cyanide: thiosulphate sulphur transferase E. C. 2. 8. 1. 1.) in sheep liver was studied. The {{effects of}} temperature, pH and some monoatomic <b>sulphur</b> <b>compound</b> were investigated. Results {{revealed that the}} temperature and pH optima were 30 O C and 8. 5 respectively. Cysteine, dithio oxiamide, glutathione and 2 -mercaptoethanol {{were not able to}} substitute for thiocyanate in rhodanese assay; these monoatomic <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> never served as sulphur donors in sheep liver rhodanese catalyzed reaction of cyanide detoxification...|$|R
40|$|The {{emission}} of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> {{into the environment}} is undesirable because of their acidifying characteristics. The processing of sulphidic ores, oil refining and sulphuric acid production are major sources of SO 2 emissions. Hydrogen sulphide is emitted into the environment as dissolved sulphide in wastewater or as H 2 S in natural gas, biogas, syngas or refinery gases. Waste streams containing sulphate are generated by many industries, including mining, metallurgical, pulp and paper and petrochemical industries. Applying process technologies that rely on the biological sulphur cycle can prevent environmental pollution. In nature <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> may cycle {{through a series of}} oxidation states (- 2, 0, + 2, + 4, + 6). Bacteria {{of a wide range of}} genera gain metabolic energy from either oxidising or reducing <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> Paques B. V. develops and constructs reactor systems to remove <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> from aqueous and gaseous streams by utilising naturally occurring bacteria from the sulphur cycle. Due to the presence of sulphide, heavy metal removal is also achieved with very high removal efficiencies. Ten years of extensive laboratory and pilot plant research has, to date, resulted in the construction of over 30 full-scale installations. This paper presents key processes from the sulphur cycle and discusses recent developments about their application in industry...|$|R
