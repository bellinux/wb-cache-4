5|$|Although Operation Backstop {{was within}} the UNPROFOR mandate (since the peacekeepers were {{authorised}} <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force</b> to prevent armed incursions into the UNPAs), Croatian authorities resented the operation.

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} shootdown, South Korea, {{owner of the}} {{aircraft}} and therefore prime considerant for jurisdiction, designated the United States and Japan as search and salvage agents, thereby making it illegal for the Soviet Union to salvage the aircraft, providing it was found outside Soviet territorial waters.

5|$|In August 1954 Sayyid Abd al-Rahman {{sponsored}} {{a tour of}} the south by Buth Diu of the Southern Liberal Party. In his speeches Buth Diu quoted NUP campaign promises supporting a Federal system in which the southern provinces would have considerable autonomy. Prime minister Azhari described this as seditious talk and threatened <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force</b> to prevent secession from Sudan by the south. In May 1955 Isma'il al-Azhari announced that Sudan would seek complete independence, a reversal of the earlier NUP position in favor of union with Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The {{men were}} met with jeers by a crowd of 2,000 to 4,000. This {{escalated}} into paving stones thrown {{through the door and}} windows of the building. Soldiers who subsequently arrived were beaten and driven away.

5|$|Diplomacy failed despite {{continuing}} pressure {{applied by}} the Allies against Athens. On 24 November, du Fournet presented a 7-day ultimatum demanding the immediate surrender {{of at least}} ten Greek mountain artillery batteries. Du Fournet was instructed not <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force</b> to take possession of the batteries. The admiral made a last effort to persuade the king to accept France's demands. He advised the king that he would land an Allied contingent, and occupy certain positions in Athens until all the demands were accepted by Greece. The king said that the citizens of Greece, {{as well as the}} army, were against disarmament, and only promised that the Greek forces would not attack the Allies.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of the South Korea by North Korea on June 25, 1950, the UN voted <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force</b> to defend South Korea. The United States, a member of the UN, simultaneously committed ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of pushing back the North Korean invasion and preventing South Korea from collapsing. But US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II, five years earlier, and at the time the closest force was the 24th Infantry Division, headquartered in Japan. The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Nevertheless, the 24th was ordered to South Korea.|$|E
5|$|However, his {{attitude}} {{could not be}} maintained. Landowners were infuriated by the unwillingness of the government <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force,</b> while the peasants were annoyed by the unwillingness to redistribute land from the latifundia. Landowners matched the strike with a lockout, and many peasants, probably {{a majority in the}} strike centres, were left without tenancies when the planting season ended in mid-December. In December 1893 the failure of the Giolitti government to restore public order gave rise to a general demand that Crispi should return to power. Giolitti had to resign on November 24, 1893, {{as a result of the}} Banca Romana scandal.|$|E
5|$|John became king in 1199 after Richard's death. William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby {{maintained}} {{the claim of}} the Earls of Derby to the Peveril estates. He paid King John 2000marks (Â£1333) for the lordship of the Peak, but the Crown retained possession of Peveril and Bolsover Castles. John finally gave Ferrers these castles in 1216 to secure his support {{in the face of}} country-wide rebellion. However, the castellan Brian de Lisle refused to hand them over. Although de Lisle and Ferrers were both King John's supporters, the king gave Ferrers permission <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force</b> to retake the castles.|$|E

5|$|The one {{exception}} to the general rule of concealment and obfuscation was that of border guards who died on duty. Most were killed either deliberately or accidentally by escapees or escape helpers. The dead guards were hailed by East German government propaganda as heroes, but West German public opinion was divided about the morality of killing border guards. Some took the view that escapees were entitled <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force</b> {{in the course of}} crossing the border, but (as in one case tried in a West Berlin court) others saw the guard's life as taking priority over an escapee's freedom.|$|E
5|$|The treaty {{recognised}} Scotland as {{an independent}} kingdom. It stipulated that Robert was to pay 40,000 marks to the English, and that Edward {{should be allowed to}} choose a wife from his own family for Robert's heir. Implied in the text, however, was an alliance between Robert and Harclay <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force</b> against Edward, if necessary, to implement the terms of the treaty. It seems unlikely that Harclay expected royal clemency for his actions. More likely he contemplated a defection to the side of Robert the Bruce; rumour had it he even planned marrying one of Bruce's daughters. It is nevertheless likely that his action grew out of genuine concern with the northern situation, and was a desperate attempt to make the best out of a difficult situation.|$|E
5|$|The {{units of}} the 4th Armoured Brigade were {{concentrated}} at Singleton, New South Wales, on 10 March 1943. As of April that year, the brigade formed part of the Land Headquarters Reserve. The 1st Army Tank Battalion was subsequently transferred to Caboolture in southern Queensland and reorganised as a self-supporting battalion group while remaining part of the 4th Armoured Brigade. The unit was redesignated the 1st Tank Battalion on 10 June 1943, and in August that year was shipped to Milne Bay in New Guinea. It subsequently supported the 9th Division during the Landing at Lae and Huon Peninsula campaign. The 1st Tank Battalion returned to Australia in June 1944 and was redesignated again to become the 1st Armoured Regiment. In the meantime the 2/4th Armoured Regiment {{was added to the}} 4th Armoured Brigade in October 1943; this unit had previously formed part of the 3rd Armoured Division and was re-equipped with Matilda II tanks. Also in October 1943, a party from the 4th Armoured Brigade armed with pistols was sent to Grovely Camp near Brisbane to put down a riot by soldiers being held under detention there, but did not need <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force.</b> During March 1944 the 2/6th Armoured Regiment was transferred to the 1st Armoured Brigade Group, and the 2/5th Armoured Regiment was transferred from that formation to the 4th Armoured Brigade.|$|E

5|$|Using {{strikes and}} other protest actions, Solidarity sought {{to force a}} change in {{government}} policies. In some cases, as in Bielsko-BiaÅa, Solidarity managed to force corrupt officials {{of the government to}} lose their jobs. At the same time, it was careful never <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force</b> or violence, so as to avoid giving the government any excuse to bring security forces into play. After 27 Bydgoszcz Solidarity members, including Jan Rulewski, were beaten up on March 19, a four-hour warning strike on March 27, involving around twelve million people, paralyzed the country. This was the largest strike {{in the history of the}} Eastern bloc, and it forced the government to promise an investigation into the beatings. This concession, and WaÅÄsa's agreement to defer further strikes, proved a setback to the movement, as the euphoria that had swept Polish society subsided. Nonetheless the Polish communist partyâthe Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR)âhad lost its total control over society.|$|E
5|$|William Peveril the Younger {{inherited}} his father's estates, but in 1155 {{they were}} confiscated by King HenryII. While in royal possession, Henry visited the castle in 1157, 1158, and 1164, {{the first time}} hosting King MalcolmIV of Scotland. During the Revolt of 1173â1174, the castle's garrison was increased from a porter and two watchmen to a force led by 20 knights shared with the castles of Bolsover and Nottingham. The Earls of Derby had a claim to the Peveril family's estates through marriage, and in 1199 William de Ferrers, the fourth earl, paid 2,000 marks for the Peak lordship, although the castle remained under royal control. The closest Peveril Castle came to seeing battle was in 1216, when King John gave the castle to William de Ferrers, but the castellan refused to relinquish control. Although they were both John's supporters, the king authorised the earl <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force</b> to evict the castellan, who eventually capitulated, {{although there is no}} evidence that the castle was assaulted.|$|E
5|$|The ground {{offensive}} in Glina commenced {{with a single}} SAO Krajina soldier tasked with firing on a JNA armoured vehicle from an area close to the police station. This attempted false flag attack was designed to make the vehicle crew believe {{that they were being}} fired on by the Croatian police, inducing them to fire at the police station. The original shooter was observed by the police and shot at from the station, which was in turn fired upon by the JNA. A JNA colonel at the scene then threatened <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force</b> against the Serb rebels unless they left the scene. Following consultations with VasiljkoviÄ, the SAO Krajina forces moved on towards ViduÅ¡evac, where they shot at a number of civilian buildings including a school and a church, before turning to approach the police station from a different direction. The assault, supported by mortar fire, continued until the following day. The police station was captured on 27 July at 11:08. According to SAO Krajina military reports, 27 Croatian military and police personnel were killed in the fighting. Croatian sources reported the deaths of two policemen and the wounding of two others, as well as the deaths of two civilians, including a German journalist killed by sniper fire. The killed journalist, Egon Scotland, a reporter of the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, was leaving Glina with a fellow reporter in a clearly marked car, when he was fatally wounded. The same source indicates that the remaining Croatian police officers managed to pull out of Glina to ViduÅ¡evac.|$|E
