5|$|As {{the world}} starts to globalize, it is {{accompanied}} by criticism of the current forms of globalization, which are feared to be overly corporate-led. As corporations become larger and multinational, their influence and interests go further accordingly. Being able to influence and own most media companies, {{it is hard to}} be able to publicly debate the notions and ideals <b>that</b> <b>corporations</b> pursue. Some choices <b>that</b> <b>corporations</b> take to make profits can affect people all over the world. Sometimes fatally.|$|E
5|$|This dictum, which {{established}} <b>that</b> <b>corporations</b> enjoyed personhood under the Equal Protection Clause, was repeatedly reaffirmed by later courts. It remained the predominant view throughout the twentieth century, {{though it was}} challenged in dissents by justices such as Hugo Black and William O. Douglas. Between 1890 and 1910, Fourteenth Amendment cases involving corporations vastly outnumbered those involving the rights of blacks, 288 to 19.|$|E
5|$|Claiming <b>that</b> <b>corporations</b> and {{government}} {{are planning to}} track every move of consumers and citizens with RFID as the latest step toward a 1984-like surveillance state, consumer privacy advocates, such as Katherine Albrecht and Liz McIntyre, have become Christian conspiracy theorists who believe spychips must be resisted because they argue that modern database and communications technologies, coupled with point of sale data-capture equipment and sophisticated ID and authentication systems, now {{make it possible to}} require a biometrically associated number or mark to make purchases. They fear that the ability to implement such a system closely resembles the Number of the Beast prophesied in the Book of Revelation.|$|E

25|$|Bowser ran {{for reelection}} in 2012. Bowser {{said she would}} not turn down {{donations}} from corporations. Candidate Max Skolnik criticized Bowser for receiving campaign contributions from developers, corporate bundlers, and lobbyists, saying that Bowser would favor the interests of these corporate donors. Bowser said she was {{not in favor of}} banning corporations from making political donations altogether, saying that doing so would {{make it more difficult to}} track where campaign donations come from. She also said <b>that</b> <b>corporations</b> are banned from donating to federal elections, but <b>that</b> <b>corporations</b> still find ways to give to campaigns.|$|E
25|$|Allegations of {{scientific}} uncertainty fuel the ongoing debate over greenhouse gas regulation, {{and are a}} major factor in debates over whether to ban particular pesticides.

25|$|Chomsky {{believes}} that these austere and neoliberal measures ensure that poorer countries merely fulfill a service role by providing cheap labor, {{raw materials and}} investment opportunities for the developed world. Additionally, this means <b>that</b> <b>corporations</b> can threaten to relocate to poorer countries, and Chomsky sees this as a powerful weapon to keep workers in richer countries in line.|$|E

25|$|Mazzocchi {{founded the}} Labor Party in 1996. For several decades, Mazzocchi had been {{convinced}} <b>that</b> <b>corporations</b> and entrenched political interests were not serving {{the best interests}} of working people.

25|$|Proponents argue <b>that</b> <b>corporations</b> {{increase}} long-term {{profits by}} operating with a CSR perspective, while {{critics argue that}} CSR distracts from businesses' economic role. A 2000 study compared existing econometric studies {{of the relationship between}} social and financial performance, concluding that the contradictory results of previous studies reporting positive, negative, and neutral financial impact, were due to flawed empirical analysis and claimed when the study is properly specified, CSR has a neutral impact on financial outcomes.|$|E

Justice Powell delivered the majority opinion and was joined by Justices Stewart, Blackmun, and Stevens, with Burger writing a separate concurring opinion. Justice White was joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall in his dissent, with Justice Rehnquist issuing a separate dissent. The Supreme Court ruled <b>that</b> <b>corporations</b> have First Amendment speech protections extending beyond material commercial interests, reversing the decision made by the Massachusetts Supreme Court.|$|E

25|$|Marshall used Federalist {{approaches}} {{to build a}} strong federal government over the opposition of the Jeffersonian Republicans, who wanted stronger state governments. His influential rulings reshaped American government, making the Supreme Court the final arbiter of constitutional interpretation. The Marshall Court struck down an act of Congress in only one case (Marbury v. Madison in 1803) but that established the Court as a center of power that could overrule the Congress, the President, the states, and all lower courts {{if that is what}} a fair reading of the Constitution required. He also defended the legal rights of corporations by tying them to the individual rights of the stockholders, thereby ensuring <b>that</b> <b>corporations</b> have the same level of protection for their property as individuals had, and shielding corporations against intrusive state governments.|$|E
25|$|On June 27, 2011, HBO premiered a {{documentary}} about tort reform problems titled Hot Coffee. A {{large portion of the}} film covered Liebeck's lawsuit. This included news clips, comments from celebrities and politicians about the case, as well as myths and misconceptions, including how many people thought she was driving when the incident occurred and thought that she suffered only minor superficial burns. The film also discussed in great depth how Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants is often used and misused to describe a frivolous lawsuit and referenced in conjunction with tort reform efforts. It contends <b>that</b> <b>corporations</b> have spent millions promoting misconceptions of tort cases in order to promote tort reform. In reality, the majority of damages in the case were punitive due to McDonald's' reckless disregard for the number of burn victims prior to Liebeck.|$|E
25|$|However, it {{took another}} decision, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Speechnow.org v. Federal Election Commission, to {{actually}} authorize the creation of super PACs. While Citizens United held <b>that</b> <b>corporations</b> and unions could make independent expenditures, a separate provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act, at least as long interpreted by the Federal Election Commission, held that individuals could not contribute to a common fund without it becoming a PAC. PACs, in turn, {{were not allowed to}} accept corporate or union contributions of any size or to accept individual contributions in excess of $5,000. In Speechnow.org, the D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, held 9â€“0 that in light of Citizens United, such restrictions on the sources and size of contributions could not apply to an organization that made only independent expenditures in support of or opposition to a candidate but not contributions to a candidate's campaign.|$|E

25|$|Galbraith's main ideas focused {{around the}} {{influence}} of the market power of large corporations. He believed that this market power weakened the widely accepted principle of consumer sovereignty, allowing corporations to be price makers, rather than price takers, allowing corporations with the strongest market power to increase the production of their goods beyond an efficient amount. He further believed that market power {{played a major role in}} inflation. He argued <b>that</b> <b>corporations</b> and trade unions could only increase prices to the extent to which that their market power allowed. He argued that in situations of excessive market power, price controls effectively controlled inflation, but cautioned against using them in markets that were basically efficient such as agricultural goods and housing. He noted that price controls were much easier to enforce in industries with relatively few buyers and sellers. Galbraith's view of market power was not entirely negative; he also noted that the power of U.S. firms played a part in the success of the U.S. economy.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the {{question}} may be raised: Are corporations themselves mere grants of monopoly privilege? Some {{advocates of the}} free market were persuaded to accept this view by Walter Lippmann's The Good Society. It should be clear from previous discussion, however, <b>that</b> <b>corporations</b> are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such individuals would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation, and that beyond this their personal funds are not liable for debts, as they would be under a partnership arrangement. It then rests with the sellers and lenders to this corporation {{to decide whether or not}} they will transact business with it. If they do, then they proceed at their own risk. Thus, the government does not grant corporations a privilege of limited liability; anything announced and freely contracted for in advance is a right of a free individual, not a special privilege. It is not necessary that governments grant charters to corporations.|$|E

[...] At first he said that [...] "the Constitution was wrong," [...] but he later {{said that he}} had misspoken. On November 15, 2011 McGovern introduced the People's Rights Amendment, a proposal to limit the Constitution's protections to only the rights of natural persons, and not corporations.

500|$|Cooder's displeasure {{with the}} Republican Party and its {{financial}} supporters, particularly the Koch Brothers, also inspired his songwriting. He found {{the party to}} be [...] "insanely dangerous" [...] to Barack Obama's presidency and the US, and said of them in an interview for The Guardian, [...] "in case anybody thinks Michele Bachmann or Sarah Palin are clowns because they misspeak or don't know their history or they say silly things: that's just an act, and it's a useful act. Everything is a distraction from the core truths which are, first of all, <b>that</b> <b>corporations</b> have taken over the country." [...] He viewed that his songs for the album provide a more convenient alternative for citizens who do not research politicians, saying that [...] "I don't write books and give speeches but with a four-minute song you can use allegory and other means to suggest {{a different point of}} view. It's like looking around the corner, and that's what songs are good at sometimes. They hit you with a new thought â€“ assuming that people will listen." ...|$|E
500|$|Starting in late 1994 {{he worked}} with Democratic Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold on {{campaign}} finance reform; their McCain-Feingold bill would attempt to put limits on [...] "soft money", funds <b>that</b> <b>corporations,</b> unions, and other organizations could donate to political parties, which would then be funneled to political candidates in circumvention of [...] "hard money" [...] donation limits. [...] From the start, McCain and Feingold's efforts were opposed {{by some of the}} interests targeted, by incumbents in both parties, by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech, and by those who wanted to lessen the power of what they saw as media bias. [...] On the other hand, it garnered considerable sympathetic coverage in the national media, and from 1995 on, [...] "maverick Republican" [...] became a label frequently applied to McCain in stories. [...] He has used the term himself, and one of the chapters in his 2002 memoir Worth the Fighting For would be titled [...] "Maverick". [...] The first version of the McCain-Feingold Act was introduced into the Senate in September 1995; it was filibustered in 1996 and never came to a vote.|$|E
500|$|Taft {{began the}} {{campaign}} on the wrong foot, fueling the arguments of those {{who said he was}} not his own man by traveling to Roosevelt's home at Sagamore Hill for advice on his acceptance speech, saying that he needed [...] "the President's judgment and criticism". Taft supported most of Roosevelt's policies. He argued that labor had a right to organize, but not boycott, and <b>that</b> <b>corporations</b> and the wealthy must also obey the law. Bryan wanted the railroads to be owned by the government, but Taft preferred that they remain in the private sector, with their maximum rates set by the Interstate Commerce Commission, subject to judicial review. Taft attributed blame for the recent recession, the Panic of 1907, to stock speculation and other abuses, and felt some reform of the currency (the U.S. was on the gold standard) was needed to allow flexibility in the government's response to poor economic times, that specific legislation on trusts was needed to supplement the Sherman Antitrust Act, and that the constitution should be amended to allow for an income tax, thus overruling decisions of the Supreme Court striking such a tax down. Roosevelt's expansive use of executive power had been controversial; Taft proposed to continue his policies, but place them on more solid legal underpinnings through the passage of legislation.|$|E
