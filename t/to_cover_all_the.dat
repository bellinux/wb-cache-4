5|$|The Philippines {{was named}} in honor of King PhilipII of Spain. Spanish {{explorer}} Ruy López de Villalobos, during his expedition in 1542, named the islands of Leyte and Samar Felipinas after the then-Prince of Asturias. Eventually the name Las Islas Filipinas would be used <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> islands of the archipelago. Before that became commonplace, other names such as Islas del Poniente (Islands of the West) and Magellan's name for the islands San Lázaro were also used by the Spanish to refer to the islands.|$|E
5|$|And the Band Played On {{was used}} as the basis for a 1993 Primetime Emmy Award-winning HBO {{television}} film of the same name. It was produced by Aaron Spelling, directed by Roger Spottiswoode, and starred Matthew Modine as epidemiologist Don Francis and Richard Masur as William Darrow at the Centers for Disease Control. Alan Alda portrayed controversial viral researcher Robert Gallo, and many other stars appeared in supporting and cameo roles, who agreed to appear in the film for union-scale pay. The film was released the same year as Philadelphia and , which prompted one reviewer to note it a triumph and a loss: 12 years after the epidemic had begun, such works of art were necessary still to draw attention to it. Reviews of the film were mixed, claiming that it was a noble try, but failed to be comprehensive enough <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> intricacies of the response to AIDS. However, And the Band Played On, along with other well-received films at the time, was noted for raising the standards of HBO-produced films.|$|E

25|$|Multiple MIDAS {{satellites}} {{would be}} needed to provide round-the-clock coverage of the huge landmass of the Soviet Union. A booster rocket capable of sending a satellite into geostationary orbit had not yet been developed, and one or a few of these might not be able <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> possible ICBM launch sites within Russia, especially in the far north near the Arctic Circle. Satellites in polar orbits {{would be needed}} to detect launches from across the Soviet Union but {{due to the nature of}} the polar orbit, each would have only a brief period of time above the Soviet Union. As the planned capabilities of the satellite changed during the design process, so did the plans for their deployment. A plan completed in January 1959 recommended a constellation of twenty MIDAS satellites orbiting at an altitude of 1,000 miles while a revised plan, produced later that year, envisioned a constellation of twelve spacecraft at 2,000-mile altitudes.|$|E

Some users reported problems with the disc drive, as when a user changes the console's orientation, the inserted disc may brush against the drive's pickup assembly and incur scratches to it. The users manual advises against changing the console's position while there is a disc in the drive. Other users report experiencing disc scratching during normal horizontal usage.|$|E

500|$|On August 14, 1959, {{the league}} held an {{organizational}} meeting and announced its plans; eight days later it announced its name: the American Football League (AFL), the fourth league {{to take that}} name. On November 24, 1959, the AFL held its first draft; the [...] "Titans of New York", as the franchise awarded to Wismer was dubbed, selected Notre Dame quarterback George Izo as their first pick. The league announced a policy, formulated by Wismer, that it would negotiate with a network for a single television contract <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> teams, the first league to do so. On December 7, the Titans hired Steve Sebo as general manager. Sebo had just been fired as coach at the University of Pennsylvania, despite taking the Quakers to the Ivy League championship. On December 17, the Titans announced {{at a press conference}} that [...] "one {{of the biggest names in}} the history of football" [...] would be soon be named as their head coach. Although Wismer was prone to hyperbole, in this case he told the truth: New York had persuaded a former NFL great, quarterback and punter Sammy Baugh, to be its coach. Since his retirement as a player, Baugh had coached at tiny Hardin-Simmons University, where he built a strong football program that sent a team to the 1958 Sun Bowl. Before appearing at the press conference, Baugh demanded his entire salary of $20,000 for 1960, in cash. The Titans accommodated him.|$|E

2500|$|If G is an apex graph with apex v, and [...] is {{the minimum}} number of faces needed <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> neighbors of v in a planar {{embedding}} of G\{v}, then G may be embedded onto a two-dimensional surface of genus 1: simply add that number of bridges to the planar embedding, connecting together all the faces into which v must be connected. For instance, adding a single vertex to an outerplanar graph (a graph with =1) produces a planar graph. When G\{v} is 3-connected, his bound is within a constant factor of optimal: every surface embedding of G requires genus at least τ/160. However, it is NP-hard to determine the optimal genus of a surface embedding of an apex graph.|$|E
2500|$|The {{previous}} 16th Edition of the IEE Electrical Wiring Regulations required use of RCDs for {{socket outlets}} that were {{liable to be}} used by outdoor appliances. Normal practice in domestic installations [...] was to use a single RCD <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> circuits requiring RCD protection (typically sockets and showers) but to have some circuits (typically lighting) not RCD protected. This was to avoid a potentially dangerous loss of lighting should the RCD trip. Protection arrangements for other circuits varied. To implement this arrangement it was common to install a consumer unit incorporating an RCD in what is known as a split load configuration, where one group of circuit breakers is supplied direct from the main switch (or time delay RCD {{in the case of a}} TT earth) and a second group of circuits is supplied via the RCD. This arrangement had the recognised problems that cumulative earth leakage currents from the normal operation of many items of equipment could cause spurious tripping of the RCD, and that tripping of the RCD would disconnect power from all the protected circuits.|$|E
2500|$|The 1951 NBA All-Star Game was an {{exhibition}} basketball game played on March 2, 1951, at Boston Garden in Boston, Massachusetts, {{home of the}} Boston Celtics. The game was {{the first edition of}} the National Basketball Association (NBA) All-Star Game and was played during the 1950–51 NBA season. The idea of holding an All-Star Game was conceived during a meeting between NBA President Maurice Podoloff, NBA publicity director Haskell Cohen and [...] Boston Celtics owner Walter A. Brown. At that time, the basketball world had just been stunned by the college basketball point-shaving scandal. In order to regain public attention to the league, Cohen suggested the league to host {{an exhibition}} game featuring the league's best players, similar to the Major League Baseball's All-Star Game. Although most people, including Podoloff, were pessimistic about the idea, Brown remained confident {{that it would be a}} success. He even offered to host the game and <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> expenses or potential losses incurred from the game. The Eastern All-Stars team defeated the Western All-Stars team 111–94. Boston Celtics' Ed Macauley was named as the first NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award.
