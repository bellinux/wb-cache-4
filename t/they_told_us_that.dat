In explaining her decision to skip the race, she denied that she was avoiding longtime rival Meseret Defar, saying, [...] "The [...] federation asked us to just run one race each, and that's why I left that race.

Chad Bianco of the Riverside County Sheriff's Department in California said, [...] "We were approached by Perverted-Justice to do this large sting and <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> 'Dateline' would be following along.

The Khazar king Joseph {{sent a letter to}} Hasdai ibn-Shaprut and informed him that he and all his people followed the rabbinical faith.

Ours was just starting, too. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> there was a steep hill at the beginning, and that it was customary for the gentlemen to walk up.|$|E
60|$|I {{signified}} my {{readiness to}} proceed, but our guides protested {{against such a}} measure. With great volubility, in their native Neapolitan dialect, with which we were not very familiar, <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> there were spectres, that the roof would fall in, {{that it was too}} narrow to admit us, that there was a deep hole within, filled with water, and we might be drowned. My friend shortened the harangue, by taking the man's torch from him; and we proceeded alone.|$|E
5000|$|The Alianza's report, {{among other}} things, {{discovered}} {{that the head of}} Chiledeportes, Christian Democrat Catalina Depassier, lied about her credentials. In her official curriculum, Depassier stated that she had graduated with a license in philosophy from the University of Chile. In an interview with the press, Monckeberg stated that a phone call with the vice-headmaster of the university revealed that Depassier had never graduated from that institution. [...] "The University explained that Depassier only studied Humanitites there for a semester in '85. <b>They</b> also <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> in '84, she also studied for one semester in the school of Government and Public Service, which she left for academic reasons," [...] Monckeberg {{said in an interview with}} El Mercurio.|$|R

60|$|On {{reaching}} the hamlet of Carisbrooke {{we found ourselves}} immediately beneath the castle. There was a fine old village church, one of those picturesque rustic edifices which abound in England, a building that time had warped and twisted {{in such a way}} as to leave few parallel lines, or straight edges, or even regular angles, in any part of it. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> also, <b>that</b> the remains of a ruined priory were at hand. We had often laughed since at the eagerness and delight with which we hurried off to look at these venerable objects. It was soon decided, however, that it was a pleasure too exquisite to be niggardly enjoyed alone, and the carriage was sent back with orders to bring up the whole party.|$|R
6000|$|At {{this point}} {{some of our}} larger men, {{themselves}} financial experts, took hold. They said that our entertainments had been on too small a scale. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> we had been [...] "undermined by overhead expenses." [...] The word [...] "overhead" [...] was soon on everybody's lips. We were told {{that if we could}} [...] "distribute our overhead" [...] it would disappear. It was therefore planned to hold a great War Kermesse with a view to spreading out the overhead so thin that it would vanish.|$|E
60|$|All this while, {{so great}} was our haste and so {{occupied}} were {{each of us}} with our own thoughts that, if my memory serves me, we scarcely interchanged a word. Down the snow slopes we marched swiftly and without hesitation, for here the road was marked for us by means of pillars of rock set opposite to one another at intervals. These pillars we observed with satisfaction, for <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> we were still upon a highway {{which led to the}} Promised Land.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was nothing}} but a hut at the landing, and a narrow road, which began then and led down the valley. The valley was very narrow, and there were steep rocks and {{mountains}} on both sides. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> it was a mile and a quarter to the inn, {{and that there was no}} other way to go but to walk. The boatman said that he would bring the baggage; so we left it under his care, all except our knapsacks, and walked along.|$|E
60|$|That night also men {{crept into}} our camp secretly, who {{were of the}} party of Kari. Of Quilla they seemed to know nothing, for none spoke of those over whom the veil of the Sun had fallen. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> however, <b>that</b> the old Inca, Upanqui, was still in Cuzco and had {{recovered}} somewhat from his sickness. Also they said that now the feud between him and Urco was bitter, but that Urco had the upper hand and was still {{in command of the}} armies. These armies, they declared, were immense and would fight us on the morrow, adding, however, that certain regiments of them who were of the party of Kari would desert to us in the battle. Lastly, they said that there was great fear in Cuzco, since none knew how that battle would end, which was understood by all to be one for the dominion of Tavantinsuyu.|$|R
60|$|They had, it seems, got {{intelligence}} {{of us when}} they came to the south part of the island, and had been a-roving as far as the Gulf of Bengal, when they met Captain Avery, with whom they joined, took several rich prizes, and, amongst the rest, one ship with the Great Mogul's daughter, and an immense treasure in money and jewels; and from thence they came about the coast of Coromandel, and afterwards that of Malabar, into the Gulf of Persia, where they also took some prize, and then designed for the south part of Madagascar; but the winds blowing hard at S.E. and S.E. by E., they came to the northward of the isle, and being after that separated by a furious tempest from the N.W., they were forced into the mouth of that creek, where they lost their ship. And <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> also, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> heard that Captain Avery himself had lost his ship also not far off.|$|R
60|$|Our hosts {{replied that}} the {{adventure}} was dangerous, {{as the weather}} might change at any moment. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> however, <b>that</b> {{on the slopes of}} this very mountain which we desired to climb, there was a large natural cave where, if need be, we could take shelter, and to this cave one of them, somewhat younger and more active than the rest, offered to guide us. So, having manufactured a rougri tent from skins, and laden our old yak, now in the best of condition, with food and garments, on one still morning we started {{as soon as it was}} light. Under the guidance of the monk, who, notwithstanding his years, walked very well, we reached the northern slope of the peak before mid-day. Here, as he had said, we found a great cave of which the opening was protected by an over-hanging ledge of rock. Evidently this cave was the favourite place of shelter for game at certain seasons of the year, since in it were heaped vast accumulations of their droppings, which removed any fear of a lack of fuel.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{look pretty}} fur, though," [...] said Mr. Poyser, {{turning his head}} {{on one side and}} {{speaking}} in rather a subdued reverential tone. [...] "Why, what could come truer nor that pictur o' the cock wi' the big spurs, as has got its head knocked down wi' th' anchor, an' th' firin', an' the ships behind? Why, that pictur was made afore Christmas, and yit it's come as true as th' Bible. Why, th' cock's France, an' th' anchor's Nelson--an' <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> beforehand." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> {{there were}} over a hundred people in the hospice when we were there. They were mostly poor peasants and some beggars. One poor man came up to me, and {{uncovered}} his neck, which was a most disgusting sight, swollen with goitre. I shut my eyes, and turned another way, like a bad Christian, while our Augustine friend walked up to him, spoke in a soothing tone, and called him [...] "my son." [...] He seemed very loving and gentle to all the poor, dirty people by whom we were surrounded.|$|E
60|$|As to Numbers of Men, they bely'd us strangely, and particularly, they seem'd only to mistake Thousands for Hundreds: For whereas <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> you in England had a Report of {{our being}} six {{thousand}} Men, I must acknowledge that I think we were never, when {{we were at the}} most, above six hundred; and at the Time when I quitted the Country, I left about one hundered and eight Men there, and no more, and I am assur'd, all the Number that now remains there, is not above twenty two Men, no, not in the whole Island.|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} of quantum gravity, depending on asymptotic boundary conditions, {{and the amount}} of supersymmetry. The cosmological constant is one of the fundamental parameters that characterize different theories. If it is positive, supersymmetry must be broken. A heuristic calculation shows that a cosmological constant of the observed size predicts superpartners in the TeV range. This mechanism for SUSY breaking also puts important constraints on low energy particle physics models. This essay was submitted to the Gravity Research Foundation Competition and is based on a longer article, which will be submitted in the near future. 1 Superstring Theory (ST) is our most successful attempt at constructing a quantum theory of gravitation. The advances of the Duality Revolution[1] gave us detailed mathematical evidence for the nonperturbative existence and consistency of the theory. Ironically, <b>they</b> also <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> its name is misleading because it emphasizes particular asymptotic regions of a collection of continuous moduli spaces of theories. A better name would be Supersymmetric Quantum Theories of Gravity (SQUIGITS) ...|$|R
5000|$|Costansó and Fages {{explored}} a canyon, {{along with}} friars Juan Crespí and Juan Vizcaíno and six soldiers, {{to see how}} far it cut inland. Along the way, they found an Indian village consisting of around 75 families. [...] "These people received us with a thousand demonstrations of happiness and joy," [...] wrote Costansó, [...] "because they recognized us and had visited us on various occasions. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> by signs <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would look for rabbits and hares for us to eat, with the understanding that we would give them ñipas, which is what they call our clothes.

"Who can say, {{how long}} she will lie there? <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> in York, <b>that</b> there was a Frenchman, of our burthen and metal, rummaging about among the fishermen, lower down on the coast. Now, Sir, no man knows {{that the war is}} half over better than myself, for not a ha'penny of prize-money has warmed my pocket, these three years;--but, as I was saying, if a Frenchman will come off his ground, and will run his ship into troubled water, why--whose fault is it but his own? A pretty affair might be made out of such a mistake, Captain Ludlow; whereas running after yonder brigantine, is napping out the Queen's canvas for nothing. The vessel's bottom will want new sheathing, in my poor opinion, before you catch him." ...|$|R
60|$|Notwithstanding {{all this}} sand, we counted three meeting-houses, and four school-houses nearly as large, on this street, though some had a tight board fence about them to {{preserve}} the plot within level and hard. Similar fences, even within a foot {{of many of the}} houses, gave the town a less cheerful and hospitable appearance than it would otherwise have had. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that,</b> on the whole, the sand had made no progress for the last ten years, the cows being no longer permitted to go at large, and every means being taken to stop the sandy tide.|$|E
60|$|Our way {{at first}} lay {{over the course}} of yesterday, along that {{beautiful}} sea coast--beautiful to the eye, but perilous to the navigator. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the winds and waves raged here with an awful power. Not long before we came, the Duke of Sutherland, an iron steamer, was wrecked upon this shore. In one respect the coast of Maine has decidedly the advantage over this, and, indeed, of every other sea coast which I have ever visited; and that is in the richness of the wooding, which veils its picturesque points and capes in luxuriant foldings of verdure.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the ways}} in which the {{involvement}} of Middle-earth Enterprises manifested itself was in how conversations are handled in the game. When the player speaks to an NPC, the game uses a system similar to Mass Effect, with the player given several response options from which to choose each time the NPC says something. However, whereas in Mass Effect, there was a moral dimension in choosing a given response, that would affect the development of the character, there is no such aspect in War in the North. Players can choose dialogue that will simply move the story forward, or dialogue that will fill in background information and expand the lore behind the game. Snowblind had initially planned to give players the option to choose rude responses and thus develop their character in different moral directions. However, Middle-earth Enterprises were against this, arguing that in Tolkien, the heroes are always decent, kind people. As such, the developers abandoned the idea. According to Tomandl, [...] "we've been working with the license holders to ensure that this really respects the franchise in a way they want it to, and one of the things <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> want our heroes to be good guys." ...|$|R

40|$|With {{drugs and}} alcohol, our {{research}} has highlighted three main areas where action is needed: • Addiction treatment does not, in itself, ensure employment, though it brings other social gains. Work has not hitherto been {{an integral part}} of treatment, {{and it needs to be}} if progress is to be made. • The benefits system, which has a central role in helping people enter or return to work, requires significant change. The system is hampered by a severe lack of information on health conditions, poor incentives for staff to tackle difficult or long-term cases, and a patchy offer of support for those who are reached. • Employers are the gatekeepers to employment and, without their co-operation employment for our cohorts is impossible. Employers are understandably reluctant to hire people with addiction and/or criminal records. <b>They</b> have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> need Government, quite simply, to de-risk these recruitment decisions for them.

60|$|On {{arriving}} at the bottom we found a party who were travelling with sheep laden with salt; <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the Yalloong village, which lay up the valley on the route to the Kanglanamo pass (leading over the south shoulder of Kubra into Sikkim) was deserted, the inhabitants having retired after the October fall of snow to Yankutang, two marches down; also that the Kanglanamo pass was impracticable, being always blocked up by the October fall.

But there we heard {{he had not yet}} arrived, he was not due till half-past five. To pass the time we drank a mouthful of aguardiente and smoked a cigarette, and eventually the medico was espied in the distance. We went towards him--a round, fat person with a red face and a redder nose, somewhat shabbily dressed.|$|E

I lifted myself up a little, for I had not strength to rise, but found she was not dead, though she was able to give very little signs of life. I had then such convulsions in my stomach, for want of some sustenance, as I cannot describe; with such frequent throes and pangs of appetite as nothing but the tortures of death can imitate; and in this condition I was when I heard the seamen above cry out, 'A sail! a sail!' and halloo and jump about as if they were distracted. I was not able to get off from the bed, and my mistress much less; and my young master was so sick that I thought he had been expiring; so we could not open the cabin door, or get any account what it was that occasioned such confusion; nor had we had any conversation with the ship's company for twelve days, <b>they</b> having <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had not a mouthful of anything to eat in the ship; and this <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> afterwards--they thought we had been dead.

By squatting down and craning my neck I peered in at the entrance, a feat which was difficult enough. She was, in truth, not much bigger than a ship's gig; but she had a soul out of all proportion to her size. The way it throbbed and strained and set her whole little frame quivering with excitement, made me think every moment that she was about to explode. The fact that she was manned exclusively by Japanese did not entirely reassure me.|$|R
