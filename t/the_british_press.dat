5|$|By contrast, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>press</b> were jubilant; many {{newspapers}} {{sought to}} portray the battle as a victory for Britain over anarchy, and the success was used to attack the supposedly pro-republican Whig politicians Charles James Fox and Richard Brinsley Sheridan.|$|E
5|$|Birdsong {{is one of}} Faulks's best-received {{works of}} fiction, both by the public and amongst reviewers. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>press</b> offered {{considerable}} praise, with positive reviews from Today, The Guardian, The Observer, The Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday, The Sunday Express, The Sunday Telegraph, The Times Literary Supplement, The Spectator and The Scotsman. American and other international press reviews were similarly positive.|$|E
5|$|Felice Beato {{arrived in}} Burma {{probably}} in December 1886, after Upper Burma had been annexed by the British in late 1885. Much publicity {{had been made}} in <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>press</b> about the three Anglo-Burmese Wars, which had started in 1825 and culminated in December 1885 with the fall of Mandalay and the capture of King Thibaw Min.|$|E

5|$|Fleet Street has a {{significant}} number of monuments and statues along its length, including the dragon at Temple Bar and memorials to a number of figures from <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>press,</b> such as Samuel Pepys and Lord Northcliffe. The street is mentioned in several works by Charles Dickens and is where the legendary fictitious murderous barber Sweeney Todd lived.|$|E
5|$|Join Hands is {{the second}} studio album by the English post-punk band Siouxsie and the Banshees. It was {{released}} in September 1979 by the record label Polydor. Upon its release, it was hailed by <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>press,</b> including Melody Maker, Sounds, NME and Record Mirror.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold then {{applied to}} {{accompany}} General Carleton, {{who was going}} to New York to replace Clinton as commander-in-chief; this request went nowhere. Other attempts all failed to gain positions within the government or the British East India Company {{over the next few years}} and he was forced to subsist on the reduced pay of non-wartime service. His reputation also came under criticism in <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>press,</b> especially when compared to that of Major André, who was celebrated for his patriotism.|$|E

5|$|Each club {{needed to}} get past four rounds to reach the final. Chelsea made {{comfortable}} progress; they scored 12 goals while conceding only one to Wycombe Wanderers in the semi-final. Arsenal fielded a relatively young team throughout the competition; their wins against fellow league opponents Liverpool in the fifth-round and Tottenham Hotspur in the semis were acclaimed by <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>press.</b> Chelsea entered the match as favourites and were undefeated against Arsenal in all competitions since 2004.|$|E
5|$|Edward VIII succeeded {{his father}} on 20 January 1936, after which Simpson {{attended}} more official functions as the King's guest. Despite her name appearing regularly in the Court Circular, {{the name of her}} husband was conspicuously absent. In the summer of that year, the King eschewed the traditional prolonged stay at Balmoral in favour of a holiday with Simpson in the eastern Mediterranean that was widely covered in the American and continental European press, but not by <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>press,</b> which maintained a self-imposed silence. Nevertheless, Canadians and expatriate Britons, who had access to the foreign reports, were largely scandalised by the coverage.|$|E
5|$|Following the film's completion, Cagney {{went back}} to the USO and toured US {{military}} bases in the UK. He refused to give interviews to <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>press,</b> preferring to concentrate on rehearsals and performances. He gave several performances a day for the Army Signal Corps of The American Cavalcade of Dance, which consisted of a history of American dance, from the earliest days to Fred Astaire, and culminated with dances from Yankee Doodle Dandy.|$|E

5|$|Hess's flight, {{but not his}} {{destination}} or fate, {{was first}} announced by Munich Radio in Germany {{on the evening of}} 12 May. On 13 May Hitler sent Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to give the news in person to Mussolini, and <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>press</b> was permitted to release full information about events that same day. On 14 May Ilse Hess finally learned that her husband had survived the trip when news of his fate was broadcast on German radio.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, Romney {{visited the}} United Kingdom, Israel, and Poland, meeting leaders {{in an effort}} to raise his {{credibility}} as a world statesman. Comments Romney made about the readiness of the 2012 Summer Olympics were perceived as undiplomatic by <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>press.</b> Israeli Prime Minister (and former BCG colleague) Benjamin Netanyahu, embraced Romney, though some Palestinians criticized him for suggesting that Israel's culture led to their greater economic success.|$|E
5|$|In early 1941 <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>press,</b> with {{permission}} from the Air Ministry, was allowed to approach Cunningham and write about his experiences. One of the motivating reasons {{for the lack of}} censorship was morale. In {{the early stages of the}} Blitz, the perception among the civilian population was that the Germans could attack at will over Britain during the night. The publication of Cunningham's exploits were an attempt to assure the public the RAF was fighting back and imposing losses upon the Luftwaffe. Cunningham was singled out for attention for this purpose, though Rawnsley's contribution to his success was virtually ignored.|$|E

5|$|In {{the later}} {{parts of his}} career and {{especially}} following retirement, Gascoigne's life became dominated by severe mental and emotional problems, particularly alcoholism. He has been jailed or sectioned on numerous occasions and his personal struggles receive regular coverage in <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>press.</b> He has frequently attempted to live without alcohol, though rehabilitation programmes have provided only temporary relief. His personal issues ended his coaching career, {{and he has not}} worked in football since being fired as the manager of Kettering Town in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Mosley {{identified}} {{his major}} achievement as FIA President as {{the promotion of}} the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP or Encap). He has also promoted increased safety and the use of green technologies in motor racing. In 2008, stories about his sex life appeared in <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>press,</b> along with unfounded allegations regarding Nazi connotations. Mosley successfully sued the newspaper that published the allegations and maintained his position as FIA president. He stood {{down at the end of}} his term in 2009 and was replaced by his preferred successor, Jean Todt.|$|E

5|$|Seacole's plight was {{highlighted}} in <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>press.</b> As a consequence a fund was set up, to which many prominent people donated money, and on 30 January 1857, she and Day were granted certificates discharging them from bankruptcy. Day {{left for the}} Antipodes to seek new opportunities, but Seacole's funds remained low. She moved from Tavistock Street to cheaper lodgings at 14 Soho Square in early 1857, triggering a plea for subscriptions from Punch on 2 May.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>press</b> {{unanimously}} {{agreed that}} Arsenal were fortunate to win; Wenger himself admitted so in {{his press conference}} afterwards. A television audience of over 480million worldwide watched the final; in the United Kingdom, coverage of the match peaked at 12.8million, making it the highest-rated game in Cup history since the 1996 final. The departures of captains Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane before the year end, coupled with the changing objectives of both clubs, meant the 2005 final is considered as the natural end point in the rivalry between Arsenal and Manchester United under Ferguson and Wenger.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} the first Allied victory over the Central Powers in the First World War. Serbia's triumph on the {{battlefield}} drew worldwide attention {{to the country and}} won the Serbs sympathy from both neutral and Allied countries. A number of foreigners flocked to Serbia in late 1914, offering financial, political, humanitarian and military aid. Articles in defence of Serbia became more frequent in <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>press.</b> Certain cultural circles in Italy advocated entering the war on the Allied side, citing Serbian and Montenegrin battlefield successes.|$|E
