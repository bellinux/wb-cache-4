5|$|Some LARP rules {{call for}} the use of {{simulated}} weapons such as foam weapons or airsoft guns to determine whether characters succeed in hitting one another in combat situations. In Russian LARP events, weapons made of hard plastic, metal or wood are used. The alternative to using simulated weapons is <b>to</b> <b>pause</b> role-play and determine the outcome of an action symbolically, for example by rolling dice, playing rock-paper-scissors or comparing character attributes.|$|E
5|$|The drop itself became {{computerized}} {{through the}} use of an electric winch synced with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's time signal; the new system was not without issues, however, as a glitch caused the ball <b>to</b> <b>pause</b> for a short moment halfway through its descent. After its 44th use in 1999, the third ball was retired and placed on display at the Atlanta headquarters of Jamestown Group, owners of One Times Square.|$|E
5|$|The planned advance {{into the}} Judean Hills would {{rely heavily on}} the ability of the lines of {{communications}} to keep the front line troops supplied with food, water and ammunition. These were already operating at considerable distances from the railhead and base areas, and as a result the advance was forced <b>to</b> <b>pause</b> on 17 November to enable supplies to be brought forward by columns under corps control, which had been sent back to railhead for rations and supplies.|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} examined 2 to 3 year old children's responses <b>to</b> <b>pauses</b> compared <b>to</b> {{their responses to}} other classes of adult behavior within child initiated request sequences. The {{results indicated that the}} children responded differentially to neutral and negative adult responses. However, only some, children made a similar distinction between long pauses, inter-utterance pauses greater than one second, and short pauses, inter-utterance pauses of one second or less. The data contributes {{to our understanding of the}} young child's responses <b>to</b> <b>pauses</b> and highlights the need for empirical validation of discourse segmentation procedures...|$|R

5|$|Criticism of the game's {{handling}} of ground combat upon its initial release prompted Paragon {{to issue an}} updated version 3.0 {{of the game in}} late 1990 which featured an enhanced combat system. The new version offered the ability for the player <b>to</b> <b>pause</b> repeatedly the real-time combat to order party members to change their positions or fire their weapons at a selected opponent. This update was made available without charge to everyone who had purchased an earlier version of the game.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{started the}} 1955–56 season, which was purely domestic, with 164 against Queensland in Brisbane. On the final day, Miller set the hosts 275 for victory in three hours. He {{lengthened}} the innings break by seven minutes, by remonstrating with officials <b>to</b> <b>pause</b> the {{match for the}} running of the Melbourne Cup. They agreed and the match was stopped for 13 minutes for the race. Queensland lost seven wickets but held on for a draw, aided by the 20 minutes lost by Miller's love of horseracing.|$|E

40|$|SummaryTranscriptional pausing by RNA {{polymerase}} (RNAP) {{plays an}} important role in the regulation of gene expression. Defined, sequence-specific pause sites have been identified biochemically. Single-molecule studies have also shown that bacterial RNAP pauses frequently during transcriptional elongation, but the relationship of these “ubiquitous” <b>pauses</b> <b>to</b> the underlying DNA sequence has been uncertain. We employed an ultrastable optical-trapping assay to follow the motion of individual molecules of RNAP transcribing templates engineered with repeated sequences carrying imbedded, sequence-specific pause sites of known regulatory function. Both the known and ubiquitous pauses appeared at reproducible locations, identified with base-pair accuracy. Ubiquitous pauses were associated with DNA sequences that show similarities <b>to</b> regulatory <b>pause</b> sequences. Data obtained for the lifetimes and efficiencies of pauses support a model where the transition <b>to</b> <b>pausing</b> branches off of the normal elongation pathway and is mediated by a common elemental state, which corresponds <b>to</b> the ubiquitous <b>pause...</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{demonstrates}} culturally different {{floor management}} strategies. The form of backchannels was similar: both Japanese and American subjects used brief utterances and head movements to signal involvement. The Japanese interlocutors, however, produced backchannels earlier {{and more often}} throughout conversation, while the Americans limited their responses mainly <b>to</b> <b>pauses</b> between turns.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{traditional}} visual {{novels that}} consist of static characters with subtitled dialogue, School Days {{is unusual in}} that it incorporates motion and voice, making it reminiscent of an animated series. Cinematics naturally play on their own, and players are afforded the ability <b>to</b> <b>pause,</b> fast-forward, and even skip those they've seen before. Male and female voices can be muted, subtitles can be turned on or off and the game can be played from a window or fullscreen ratio. Progress can be saved {{at any time in}} up to 100 slots and loaded from either the main menu or during play.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a {{marksman}} from the Redoutable, firing at a range of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them <b>to</b> <b>pause</b> while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E
5|$|Lennon's murder {{triggered}} {{an outpouring}} of grief {{around the world on}} an unprecedented scale. Lennon's remains were cremated at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, Westchester County, N.Y.; no funeral was held. Ono sent word to the chanting crowd outside the Dakota that their singing had kept her awake; she asked that they re-convene at Central Park's Naumburg Bandshell the following Sunday for ten minutes of silent prayer. On 14 December 1980, {{millions of people around the}} world responded to Ono's request <b>to</b> <b>pause</b> for ten minutes of silence to remember Lennon. Thirty thousand gathered in Liverpool, and the largest group—over 225,000—converged on New York's Central Park, close to the scene of the shooting. For those ten minutes, every radio station in New York City went off the air.|$|E

5|$|Marta {{continues}} {{running in}} the direction she believes will lead back to Pleasant Valley, swimming across Middle Fork River, crossing the nearby highway and railroad tracks, and running through various woodlands in between. Pausing only to drink water and tend her paws, she crosses Pyramid Peak and swims across the Hungry Horse Reservoir, before a week without food and exhaustion cause her to collapse on the shore. After resting, she continues her run, though hunger now spurs her <b>to</b> <b>pause</b> to hunt when she can but she eventually collapses by Flathead Lake, where she remains unconscious for days. Meanwhile, unskilled at hunting and without the adults {{to teach them how}} to survive, Annie and Sula slowly starve to death. Oldtooth reaches Middle Fork Valley, where illness and his lame foot drive him to hunt local livestock. He is shot and killed by a human.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 8 December, Ottoman {{artillery}} began firing on a road junction, which Mott's Detachment had to negotiate. Unable to advance or retaliate against the accurate shell fire from an Ottoman battery near Bethlehem, the detachment waited. At around noon, Chetwode, the corps' commander, ordered the detachment to get moving. Mott finally attacked his main objective at Beit Jala at 16:00, but the Ottoman Army had already retired. It {{was not until the}} evening that they continued their advanced to find the way completely clear of Ottoman defenders. At the crucial moment, Mott's Detachment was unable to cover the southern flank of the 60th (London) Division, forcing the Londoners <b>to</b> <b>pause</b> during daylight, as enfilading fire would have made any advance extremely costly.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 4S {{can play}} music, movies, {{television}} shows, ebooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes. The iPhone 4S uses a large font that allows users {{plenty of room}} to touch their selection. Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used <b>to</b> <b>pause,</b> play, skip, and repeat tracks.

40|$|This is {{the case}} of a 73 year-old female who {{presented}} to clinic complaining of pre-syncope. A 24 -hour Holter monitor revealed multiple epi-sodes of 2 – 2. 5 s pauses associated with non-con-ducted P waves (Fig. 1). Careful examination of the rhythm strip revealed high-frequency, low-ampli-tude signal during and immediately prior <b>to</b> the <b>pauses.</b> This high-frequency low-amplitude signal was particularly marked during the pause. The PR interval was observed to lengthen slightly in the beats prior <b>to</b> the <b>pause</b> and there was slight slow-ing of the sinus rate. Figure 1.

5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Grant Kirkhope, who previously worked {{as the main}} composer for Perfect Dark, Donkey Kong 64, and Banjo-Kazooie. As Banjo-Tooie was a larger game than its predecessor, Kirkhope had twice the memory space in the game's cartridge for sound effects and music. Kirkhope initially had <b>to</b> <b>pause</b> his work on Banjo-Tooie to work on other projects first, but ultimately the music score for the game was completed on time. Like the original, the themes heard in the game were designed to be interactive, which dynamically change to reflect the player's location. Due to the game having larger memory space Kirkhope was able to combine two MIDI files to channel different fades of music when the player moves to different locations. The developers initially aimed for a fourth quarter 1999 release, but the game was ultimately delayed. Banjo-Tooie {{was presented at the}} 2000 Electronic Entertainment Expo and released on 20 November 2000. The game supports the Nintendo 64 Rumble Pak.|$|E
5|$|The player {{interacts with}} {{characters}} and objects by clicking on them. Clicking {{on the ground}} causes the player's selected characters to move. The gameplay, though in real-time, can be paused, whereupon commands may be issued to controllable characters, who will attempt to execute them when the game is unpaused. The game can also be set <b>to</b> <b>pause</b> automatically at certain times. Dialogue is started by NPCs at certain scripted times, or by the player's clicking on NPCs who are not immediately hostile. When speaking to an NPC, the player must often choose what to say {{from a list of}} responses. The dialogue may lead to quests or important information. When the player clicks on a hostile being, the currently selected characters will advance to attack it. Information about characters, creatures, items, and buildings in the game environment is shown on a tool tip, which appears when the mouse pointer is held over game elements.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera {{in front of the}} plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player <b>to</b> <b>pause,</b> rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|E
