40|$|This paper {{presents}} an exhaustive study on <b>the</b> <b>arrivals</b> process at eight important European airports. Using inbound traffic data, we define, compare, and contrast a data-driven Poisson and PSRA point process. Although, {{there is sufficient}} evidence that the interarrivals might follow an exponential distribution, this finding does not directly translate to evidence that <b>the</b> <b>arrivals</b> stream is Poisson. The main reason is that finite-capacity constraints impose a correlation structure to <b>the</b> <b>arrivals</b> stream, which a Poisson model cannot capture. We show the weaknesses and somehow the difficulties of using a Poisson process to model with good approximation <b>the</b> <b>arrivals</b> stream. On <b>the</b> other hand, our innovative non-parametric, data-driven PSRA model, predicts quite well and captures important properties of <b>the</b> typical <b>arrivals</b> stream...|$|R

5|$|Sir John Carling, Tory MP for London, gave three {{events to}} explain the {{development}} of London in a 1901 speech.

5|$|The otters {{may leave}} the den by eight weeks and {{are capable of}} {{sustaining}} themselves upon <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of fall, but they usually stay with their families, which sometimes include the father, until the following spring.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>arrivals</b> {{level is}} underground, with 8 arrival gates {{situated}} {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the Beijing Subway station concourse. To the sides are two taxi stands, and separated West and East parking lots for private cars (including a mezzanine level). Express entrances have been built, and are presently in use for all C trains to Tianjin, as well as some trains to Shanghai. Ticket machines and a few ticket counters are also available at <b>the</b> <b>arrivals</b> level. As with the departures level, a variety of restaurants and corner shops are also available at <b>the</b> <b>arrivals</b> level. Two floors below <b>the</b> <b>arrivals</b> level are <b>the</b> platforms for Lines 4 and 14, respectively, with Line 4 services available at present, and Line 14 services coming later in 2015.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Arrivals</b> {{level is}} on the lower level of the airport and {{provides}} seven baggage claim belts, two in Terminal A, two in Terminal B and three in Terminal C. Immediately outside the baggage claim is <b>the</b> curbside <b>arrivals</b> pickup area. Rental car offices are between Terminal A and B baggage claim areas with most rental agencies on site in {{the lower levels of}} the parking facility across <b>the</b> <b>arrivals</b> pickup area between Terminal A and B. Across the roadway from <b>the</b> <b>arrivals</b> pickup area between Terminal A and B is an island for public transportation, including taxis, buses and the Disneyland Resort Express.|$|R

5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of Europeans in the area, {{wildebeest}} used to roam widely, {{probably in}} relation to <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the rains {{and the availability of}} good forage. They never made such extensive migrations as the blue wildebeest but at one time, they used to cross the Drakensberg Range, moving eastwards in autumn, searching for good pastures. Then they returned to the highvelds in the spring and moved towards the west, where sweet potato and Karoo vegetation were abundant. They also moved from north to south as the sourgrass found north of the Vaal River matured and became unpalatable, the wildebeest only consuming young shoots of sourgrass. Nowadays, almost all black wildebeest are in reserves or on farms and the extent of their movements is limited.|$|E

5|$|Egypt {{and much}} of Palestine were {{controlled}} by the Arab Shi'ite Fatimid Caliphate, which was significantly smaller since <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the Seljuqs. Warfare between the Fatimids and Seljuqs caused great disruption for the local Christians and for western pilgrims. The Fatimids, under the nominal rule of caliph al-Musta'li but actually controlled by vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah, had lost Jerusalem to the Seljuqs in 1073 (although some older accounts say 1076); they recaptured it in 1098 from the Artuqids, a smaller Turkish tribe associated with the Seljuqs, just before <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the crusaders.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of Gary Megson as Bolton manager, the team's and Nolan's {{performances}} were criticised by {{a section of}} the club's fans. This resulted in the midfielder completing a £4million transfer to Newcastle United in the January 2009 transfer window.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} three months the siege {{continued}} with little significant activity on either side, until <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> at the end of July of General François Watrin with 5,000 additional men and instructions from General Joachim Murat to prosecute the siege more vigorously. However, <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> off Porto Ferrajo on 1 August of a powerful British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren in HMS Renown, whose ship chased Bravoure and Succès as far as Leghorn and reopened the sea passage into the port, almost immediately frustrated Watrin's ambitions. At the same time, a small British force under Captain Gordon landed at Porto Ferrajo to augment the Tuscan garrison.|$|E

5|$|German forces {{began to}} probe the 1st Airlanding Brigade defences {{throughout}} the morning. Units of Kampfgruppe Von Tettau attacked the Border's positions; men of the SS NCO school overran Renkum and Kriegsmarine troops engaged the British all day as they withdrew. Small amounts of fighting broke out around LZ 'X' {{but not enough to}} seriously hamper the glider landing there. At DZ 'Y', the Dutch SS Wach Battalion became heavily engaged with the King's Own Scottish Borderers, threatening to hamper <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the second lift. The communications breakdown meant {{that it was impossible to}} warn the aircraft. Equally, there was no way for the division to know that the 2nd lift had been delayed by ground fog in England. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the 4th Parachute Brigade under Brigadier Hackett and several more troops of artillery at the drop zones was several hours overdue. When the parachutists did arrive after 15:00, they dropped under fire. Several were killed as aircraft and parachutists were shot down and the heath-land they were landing on caught fire. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of a full brigade overwhelmed the Dutch who were routed and surrendered in droves.|$|E
