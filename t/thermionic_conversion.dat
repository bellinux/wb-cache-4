All practical thermionic converters to date employ caesium vapor between the electrodes, which determines both the surface and plasma properties.

The SEHPTR spacecraft will be able to supply 40 kW of power in any given orbit. The key components in this reactor are the thermionic heat pipes. The heat pipes have two major functions: (1) to convert heat energy into electrical energy, and (2) to radiate the excess heat to space. <b>Thermionic</b> power <b>conversion</b> is the process of converting heat energy into electrical energy with no moving parts.
