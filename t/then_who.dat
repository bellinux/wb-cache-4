From October 1866 until July 1867, all offensive operations were suspended. During this period, Caxias trained his soldiers, re-equipped the army with newer guns, improved the quality of the officer corps, and upgraded the health corps and overall hygiene of the troops, putting an end to epidemics. Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay (later the Viscount of Taunay), who fought in the war, remembered that Caxias was a [...] "generous military chief, who forgave small errors, but was implacable with those who committed grave misdeeds, or, <b>then,</b> <b>who</b> betrayed his confidence." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 1962, Olivia died of measles {{encephalitis}} at age seven. Her death left Dahl [...] "limp with despair", {{and gave}} him a feeling of guilt that he could not do anything for her. Dahl subsequently became a proponent of immunisation and dedicated his 1982 book The BFG to his daughter. After Olivia's death, Dahl lost faith in God and viewed religion as a sham. While mourning her loss he had sought spiritual guidance from the former Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher, but became dismayed when Fisher told him that although Olivia was in Paradise, her beloved dog Rowley would never join her there, with Dahl recalling: [...] "I wanted to ask him how he could be so absolutely sure that other creatures did not get the same special treatment as us.

2500|$|Assuming Quaresma {{is indeed}} Fernando de Noronha, <b>then</b> <b>who</b> {{discovered}} it? [...] One proposal {{is that it}} was discovered by a royal Portuguese mapping expedition that was sent out in May, 1501, commanded by an unknown captain (possibly André Gonçalves) and also accompanied by Amerigo Vespucci. [...] According to Vespucci, this expedition returned to Lisbon in September 1502, just on time to influence the final composition of the Cantino map. [...] Unfortunately, Vespucci does not report discovering this island then – indeed he is quite clear that the first time he (and his fellow sailors) saw the island was on the 1503 Coelho expedition. However, there is a letter written by an Italian saying that a ship arrived [...] "from the land of Parrots" [...] in Lisbon on July 22, 1502 (three months before Vespucci). [...] This could be a stray ship from the mapping expedition that returned prematurely, or another expedition altogether, about which we have no information. [...] The timing of its reputed arrival (July 1502), makes it possible that it stumbled on the island sometime in March 1502, on the homeward voyage, well within Lent.|$|E

[...] So Zimri assembled 24,000 Israelites and went to Cozbi and demanded that she surrender herself to him. [...] She replied {{that she was a}} king's daughter and her father had instructed her not to submit to any but to the greatest of men. [...] Zimri replied that he was the prince of a tribe and that his tribe was greater than that of Moses, for Simeon was second in birth, while Levi was third. [...] Zimri then seized Cozbi by her hair and brought her before Moses. [...] Zimri demanded that Moses rule whether Cozbi was forbidden or permitted to Zimri. [...] Zimri continued that if Moses were to say that Cozbi was forbidden to Zimri, <b>then</b> <b>who</b> permitted Moses to marry the Midianite woman Zipporah? [...] At that moment, Moses forgot the law governing intimacy with an idolatrous woman, and all the people burst into tears, as [...] reports when it says, [...] "they were weeping {{at the door of the}} tent of meeting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jesus {{told his}} apostles that {{after his death}} and resurrection he would send them the [...] "Advocate" [...] ( [...] ; [...] ), the [...] "Holy Spirit", who [...] "will teach you {{everything}} and remind you of all that I told you". In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus tells his disciples [...] "If you <b>then,</b> <b>who</b> are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!" [...] The Nicene Creed states that the Holy Spirit is one with God the Father and God the Son (Jesus); thus, for Catholics, receiving the Holy Spirit is receiving God, {{the source of all}} that is good. Catholics formally ask for and receive the Holy Spirit through the sacrament of Confirmation (Chrismation). Sometimes called the sacrament of Christian maturity, Confirmation is believed to bring an increase and deepening of the grace received at Baptism. Spiritual graces or gifts of the Holy Spirit can include wisdom to see and follow God's plan, right judgment, love for others, courage in witnessing the faith, knowledge, reverence, and rejoicing in the presence of God. The corresponding fruits of the Holy Spirit are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. To be validly confirmed, a person must be in a state of grace, which means that they cannot be conscious of having committed a mortal sin. They must also have prepared spiritually for the sacrament, chosen a sponsor or godparent for spiritual support, and selected a saint to be their special patron and intercessor.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the sixth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Isaac blessed Jacob, asking God {{to give him}} abundance, make peoples serve him, make him master over his brothers, curse those who cursed him, and bless those who blessed him. Just as Jacob left, Esau {{returned}} from the hunt, prepared a dish for Isaac, and asked Isaac for his blessing. Isaac asked who he was, and Esau {{said that it was}} he. Isaac trembled and asked who it was <b>then</b> <b>who</b> had served him, received his blessing, and now must remain blessed. Esau burst into sobbing, and asked Isaac to bless him too, but Isaac answered that Jacob had taken Esau's blessing with guile. Esau asked whether Jacob had been so named that he might supplant Esau twice, first taking his birthright and now his blessing. Esau asked Isaac whether he had not reserved a blessing for Esau, but Isaac answered that he had made Jacob master over him and sustained him with grain and wine, and asked what, then, he could still do for Esau. Esau wept and pressed Isaac to bless him, too, so Isaac blessed him to enjoy the fat of the earth and the dew of heaven, to live by his sword and to serve his brother, but also to break his yoke. Esau harbored a grudge against Jacob, and told himself that he would kill Jacob upon Isaac's death. When Esau's words reached Rebekah, she told Jacob to flee to Haran and her brother Laban and remain there until Esau's fury subsided and Rebekah fetched him from there, so that Rebekah would not lose both sons in one day. Rebekah told Isaac her disgust with the idea that Jacob might marry a Hittite woman, so Isaac sent for Jacob, blessed him, and instructed him not to take a Canaanite wife, but to go to Padan-aram and the house of Bethuel to take a wife from among Laban's daughters. And Isaac blessed Jacob with fertility and the blessing of Abraham, that he might possess the land that God had assigned to Abraham. The sixth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
