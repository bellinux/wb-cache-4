SFD bearing performance from a en stage high pressure barrel centrifugal compressor that has been specifically modified for SFD bearing development is presented. SFD bearing performance is investigated for both synchronous imbalance response and rotordynamic instability. A comparison is made of experimental and analytical results for a hydrodynamic ive shoe <b>tilt</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> supported by an 0 ring centered damper eccentricity, e = 0. 0 and e = 0. 6), mechanically spring centered damper (e = 0. 0 and e = 0. 8), a bottom resting damper (e = 1. 0), end a standard nondamper (rigid support).

40|$|Problems {{with long}} shaft pumps are {{becoming}} clearer {{due to increased}} use, better instrumentation, more analysis, and increased testing activity. The problems are with reliability and not with hydraulic performance. The root cause of reliability problems is usually excessive vibration caused by design. The outlook for satisfactory pumps is improved as understanding of problems increases. Promising developments are emerging such as the <b>tilt</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing.</b> Alternative configurations, such as gas filled columns and submerged motor pumps, will require development. Continued development, in general, should be expected due to changing technology and industry changes. This report describes thirteen distinct pump programs starting with leakage of original mixer pumps in the 1980 s and ending with the testing of tilt pad bearings now in progress. Eight of the programs occurred from 1996 to 2000. All involve long shaft pumps; all involve testing at TNX; and all involve a problem of some kind. The common technical issue among the activities is vibration and shaft (or rotor) instability due to journal bearings.

40|$|LecturePg. 31 - 42 Analysis, design, and {{optimization}} of {{high performance}} journal and thrust bearings {{in a high}} speed integrally geared compressor are described. The high speed and relatively small bearing size stretches the applicable limits of conventional style tilt pad bearings. The variation in the load magnitude, {{as is the case}} with most gear loaded bearings, requires careful analysis of the stability and unbalance response characteristics. An optimized new flexible pivot bearing was used in this application to provide stable operation throughout the wide ranges of load and inlet temperature. The bearing incorporated a directed lubrication feature to reduce the hot oil carry over which is known to be a major contributor to high bearing temperatures in high speed applications. The precision inherent in the manufacturing process used to produce this style of bearing allowed further optimization of the preload and pivot offset. The use of an offset pivot configuration demonstrated lower sensitivity to bearing clearance variation. The necessity for high rotational speeds in integrally geared compressors increases the frictional power losses in the journal and thrust bearings. The parasitic losses constitute a significant percentage of the overall bearing power losses. Bearing designs that were utilized to reduce both the frictional and parasitic losses in the thrust bearings are discussed. The new thrust bearings were designed to provide an optimum crown-to-film thickness ratio allowing the bearing to carry the design thrust load with fewer pads. The analytical results for the conventional and deflection journal and thrust bearings are presented and compared to the test data. The new bearing resulted in lower steady state vibrations. At surge conditions, the synchronous and subsynchronous vibrations were about 25 percent of the conventional <b>tilt</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing.</b> The frictional and parasitic power losses with the new thrust bearing were about 20 percent lower than those of the conventional bearings. The temperature rise was also lower which indicated that the inlet temperature can be further increased with the new bearing allowing a wider operating temperature range and lower frictional losses...|$|E

40|$|In <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> design process, the {{selection}} of the proper configuration type of either a Load-Between-Pad (LBP) or Load-On-Pad (LOP) as well as preload and pivot offset conditions is to be carefully considered. Also the bearing needs to be designed in order to be suited for the rotor-bearing system and operating condition. In this paper, it is observed that the static and dynamic characteristics of a five <b>pad</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> for the LBP and LOP configurations are influenced by the variation of preload and pivot offset. In this context, rotor dynamic analysis of the 5 MW industrial gas turbine supported by the <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> at the front and roller bearing at the rear is carried out based on the dynamic coefficients of the <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> investigated.

40|$|LectureTilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearings</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} in high power and/or high speed pump applications. Traditional white metallined {{also known as}} babbitted <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearings</b> are used for oil lubricated <b>bearings.</b> Babbitted <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearings</b> are not ideal for applications with low viscous lubricants, like waterbased fluids. For these applications, polymer bearings offer many advantages over traditional bearing materials including: Low friction coefficient, Higher flexibility, Wide range of operational temperature, High corrosion and chemical resistance, High shock and impact resistance, Tolerance against particle contamination, Electrical insulation. To achieve the desired improvement in performance, the material specifics of the polymer have to be carefully considered in the design process. One option available is a polymer lined <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> which combines the excellent tribological properties of polymers and the high structural stiffness of the steel back. But a polymer lined metal pad does not provide the same equalizing effect offered by the higher compressibility of a solid polymer pad. For example the problems of an edge carrier can be reduced for a <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> journal <b>bearing</b> and the self-equalizing mechanism can be avoided for a <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> thrust <b>bearing</b> while considering the higher flexibility of solid PEEK pads. An additional advantage of a solid polymer pad is {{the elimination of the}} bonding between the polymer and the steel, so that a possible source of a bearing failure can be avoided upfront already. During a qualification test of a commercially available solid polymer <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> thrust <b>bearing,</b> the high Hertzian contact stress at the pivot let to indentations in the polymer. After a few operating hours these indentations are clearly visible and will finally lead to a complete loss of the advantages of a <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> over a fixed geometry bearing. This lecture describes the steps involved in the optimization of the solid polymer <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> design, with the objective to increase the reliability of the bearing assembly. The limitations of the available solid polymer <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> thrust <b>bearing</b> have been overcome by the integration of a metal reinforced pivot as mentioned by Gassmann et al. (2013). The results of the TEHD analysis presented form the base of the optimized journal and thrust bearing design. The new journal and thrust bearing design has been validated through testing of a prototype. The data collected during tests with the optimized thrust and journal bearings are in excellent agreement with the simulations. With the optimized bearing design, the limitations of the original pad design have been mitigated. The successfully qualified journal and thrust bearing are one of the building blocks required for product lubricated pumps and will be used in subsea pump applications...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 25 - 32 One {{property}} of heavily to moderately loaded sleeve bearings is the resulting asymmetric stiffness and damping coefficients. These asymmetric properties often result in split {{first critical speed}}s. Since the horizontal stiffness is much softer than the vertical, a horizontal first critical speed may appear from several hundred to several thousand revolutions per minute lower than the vertical first critical. <b>Tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearings</b> produce more symmetric bearing properties.

The results showed that the rotordynamic stability of the subject compressor rotor-bearing system improves exactly in accordance with the effects of the bearing design variables, which were determined in the preceding Part I study, owing to reduced bearing stiffnesses. Specifically, it was confirmed that the stability of the rotor system can be greatly improved by increasing both the machined and assembled bearing clearances, but there were no stability improvements by simply changing from an LBP to an LOP design.
