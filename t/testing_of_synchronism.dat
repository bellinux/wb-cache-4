This system {{is made of}} a rapidly {{pulsating}} subdwarf B (sdB) star with an unseen companion, most likely a white dwarf. The presence of nonradial oscillations offers the opportunity to infer the inner profile and period of rotation of the primary star through asteroseismology. This constitutes the key element for testing spin-orbit synchronism in depth, since stellar internal layers are inaccessible to traditional techniques. Methods: We carried out a new asteroseismic analysis of Feige 48 following the so-called ?forward modeling? approach. This is done with our latest optimization algorithms, which have been updated to incorporate the effect of stellar rotation on pulsations, assuming various internal rotation laws. In this analysis, the simultaneous match of all the frequencies observed in Feige 48 leads objectively to the full identification of the pulsation modes through {{the determination of the}} indices k, ?, m. It also leads to determining the structural and rotational parameters of Feige 48. Results: Our optimal model, obtained with a solid-body rotation law, is characterized by a spin period of 9. 028 ± 0. 480 h. This value is remarkably similar to the system's orbital period of 9. 024 ± 0. 072 h, measured independently from radial velocity variations. We further demonstrate that the hypothesis of differential rotation of the core - including a fast rotating core - must be eliminated for Feige 48. Conclusions: These results strongly imply that Feige 48 rotates as a solid body in a tidally locked system. This constitutes the first explicit demonstration <b>of</b> spin-orbit <b>synchronism</b> in a binary star by asteroseismic means...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} era, the power system {{has become a}} vital part to provide {{stability}} enhancement. The stability of a power system depends on how low frequency disturbances which are typically in the frequency range of 0. 2 to 3. 0 Hz, accurately find out and cleared so that quick restoration and maintains a stability enhancement of power is accomplished. Loss <b>of</b> <b>synchronism</b> and stability enhancement are needs to be performed using ANFIS controlled based excitation of power system [3]. The significant factors which affect the operation of power system during the occurrence of low frequency disturbances are mainly; Loss <b>of</b> <b>synchronism</b> which might be excited by the disturbances in the system or, in some cases, might even build up spontaneously. These factors can be analyzed {{to find out the}} occurrence of the low frequency disturbance in the power line operation. Various techniques like Power System Stabilizer with algorithm based or logic controlled based, UPFC has been used in past to find out and cleared the different low frequency disturbances occurred in the transmission line. The proper selection of enhanced feedback is a very tedious and time consuming task and also requires brief knowledge of the system configuration. To avoid the drawbacks of conventional power system stabilizer with algorithm or logic controller based techniques, this dissertation proposed, an efficient and robust technique of stability enhancement using ANFIS based power system excitation. The advantage of the proposed technique is that; it improves the overshoot of power and reduced the time for low frequency oscillations [1]. The ANFIS based stability enhancement accuracy of proposed technique has been verified using MATLAB/Simulink 2013 (a) software. The obtained results show that the proposed technique is efficient in stability enhancement of all type <b>of</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>synchronism</b> and hence reliable tool for low frequency disturbance occurred in power system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Power {{systems are}} subject {{to a wide range}} of small or large {{disturbances}} during operating conditions. Small changes in loading conditions occur continually. The power system must adjust to these changing conditions and continue to operate satisfactorily and within the desired limits of voltage and frequency. The power system should be designed to survive larger types of disturbances, such as faults, loss of a large generator, or line switching. Certain system disturbances may cause loss <b>of</b> <b>synchronism</b> between a generator and rest of the utility system, or between interconnected power systems of neighboring utilities. If such a loss <b>of</b> <b>synchronism</b> occurs, it is imperative that the generator or system areas operating asynchronously are separated immediately to avoid widespread outages and equipment damage. Here it is described to distinguish between power swing and real fault. It is also discussed recent enhancements in the design of out of step tripping and blocking protection functions that improve the security and reliability of the power system. In addition to that the behavior of distance relay element during power swing and during fault is simulated using MATLAB and SIMULINK simulations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{connection}} between the concept <b>of</b> <b>synchronism</b> and the accuracy of the solutions to relative motion. If the problem is formulated using an independent variable different from time it is possible to escape from the standard time-synchronism, obtaining an asynchronous solution. The synchronism may be recovered through a first order correction. This correction is based on the dynamics of the problem, and higher-order terms are easily retained. A second order correction introduces nonlinear effects in the solution through simple mechanisms, and improves its accuracy. The proposed correction is a generic concept not restricted to any particular formulation. To illustrate this assertion the second order correction is applied to the ClohessyWiltshire solution and to the Yamanaka-Ankersen state transition matrix. The fundamentals <b>of</b> <b>synchronism</b> are introduced by deriving the variational solution to relative motion using the equinoctial orbital elements. Numerical results show that the corrected solutions may reduce the error by several orders of magnitude, both in position and velocity. The corrected solution may be more accurate than the exact solution to the second and third order equations of motion in long-term propagations...|$|R
