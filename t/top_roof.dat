40|$|This report {{presents}} an analysis concerning {{the prospect of}} establishing green <b>roof</b> <b>tops</b> in Copenhagen in order to adapt to future climate changes through sustainable design solutions. The analysis examines the capabilities and constraints of multiple existing green <b>roof</b> <b>top</b> solutions, aiming to make {{the costs and benefits}} from these solutions transparent. Furthermore the report features our own green <b>roof</b> <b>top</b> design solution. The design is presented through a three- dimensional animated model, uniting environmental design principles and our own observations visiting green <b>roof</b> <b>tops</b> in Copenhagen. The main conclusion of the analysis is that the prospect of establishing green <b>roof</b> <b>tops</b> is determined by a number of not fully identified dynamics. With the intention of implementing additional green <b>roof</b> <b>tops</b> in Copenhagen, one must look to address the awareness of sustainability. We suggest taking further green <b>roof</b> <b>top</b> initiatives in the city of Copenhagen the potential of these solutions in mind...|$|R

2500|$|As the {{traverse}} of {{the main}} gun was limited, it had first to be pointed {{in the general direction}} of the target by the driver-commander swivelling the entire vehicle. To facilitate this, a small rectangular frame is fitted on the right side of the nose of the tank. Looking through it, the driver had a sightline parallel to that of the cannon in a neutral position. In practice, the commander had a too limited view of his surroundings through the small hatches to his left, front and right and had to resort to lifting his head out of his rectangular top hatch to observe the enemy. [...] Small rectangular hatches, fitted with a vision slit, are further present to the front of each machine-gun. The main ventilation is provided by a large skylight slit running along the midline of the hull. [...] It is doubly roofed with the lower roof having a second slit in its top, while the higher roof has open lower sides, creating oblique oblong ventilation channels through which fresh air can be sucked in from the outside. The <b>top</b> <b>roof</b> is the highest element of the vehicle. [...] With later production vehicles, polluted air is removed through a broad ventilation grid in the nose, having a recessed armour plate below it. To the left and the right of the skylight roof rectangular escape hatches are present in the hull top.|$|E
