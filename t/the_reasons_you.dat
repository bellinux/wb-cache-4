6000|$|... "Fairly," [...] Lisle responded, smiling. [...] "I've already {{confessed that}} you people {{interest}} me. At the same time, I had my difficulties--first {{of all to}} explain to the Marples why you didn't come. <b>The</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>you</b> gave didn't sound convincing." ...|$|E

"And you know--and I know--that {{you have}} not sent her away for <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>you</b> have assigned, but {{for the purpose of}} {{separating}} her as much as possible from--excuse my mentioning it as a matter of business--any reproach and exposure that impend over yourself." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Do {{you think}} he don't know that?' {{returned}} the other scornfully. 'But come, Pinch, before I say anything more to you, just run over <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>you</b> have for being grateful to him at all, will you? Change hands first, for the box is heavy. That'll do. Now, go on.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Don't be a fool, Horne,' he began. 'You {{know very}} well that I have done this for none of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>you</b> are {{throwing}} at me.' And in a moment he became outwardly as steady as a rock under the other's lurid stare. 'I have been thwarting, deceiving, and betraying you--from conviction.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Atherton, {{keeping the}} same {{scrutiny}} of Halleck's face {{which he had}} bent upon him throughout, but seeming now to hear his thoughts rather than his words. [...] "I knew {{that you would have}} some supreme motive; and if I have pretended to approve your scheme on <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>you</b> have given me, I haven't dealt honestly with you. But perhaps a little dishonesty is the best thing under the circumstances. You haven't told me your real motive, and I can't ask it" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said, [...] "I'd be glad if {{you would}} tell me exactly why <b>you</b> {{followed}} me. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>you</b> gave didn't seem sufficient." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, well," [...] he said, [...] "you {{were born}} lazy, and I was born restless. That is <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>you</b> have done something, and I haven't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not if {{he knows}} it. But I don't know--What do you say, March? What's <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>you</b> couldn't get us up a paper on the strike?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "DEAR MISS GARTH--I {{have only}} a moment to assure you of the sorrow with which I have read your letter. The {{circumstances}} under which you urge your request, and <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>you</b> give for making it, are sufficient to silence any objection I might otherwise feel to the course you propose. A trustworthy person, whom I have myself instructed, will start for Allonby to-day, {{and as soon as}} I receive any news from him, you shall hear of it by special messenger. Tell Miss Vanstone this, and pray add the sincere expression of my sympathy and regard.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} in what you say," [...] the Easy Chair confessed. [...] "Our popular failure as a critic is notorious; it cannot be denied. The stamp of our disapproval at one time gave a whole order of fiction a currency that was not less than torrential. The flood of romantic novels which passed over the land, and which is still to be traced in the tatters of the rag-doll heroes and heroines caught in the memories of readers along its course, was undoubtedly the effect of our adverse criticism. No, we could not in conscience compile and publish a list of The Hundred Worst Books; it would be contrary, for <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>you</b> give, to public morals." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Charming," [...] {{answered}} she, [...] "all <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>you</b> {{have given}} me are very good ones, and I assure you that I should have more pleasure in obliging you than anyone else, but you must know that a month ago as I was walking by the river with my ladies I took off my glove, and as I did so a ring that I was wearing slipped off my finger and rolled into the water. As I valued it more than my kingdom, you may imagine how vexed I was at losing it, and I vowed to never listen to any proposal of marriage unless the ambassador first brought me back my ring. So now {{you know what is}} expected of you, for if you talked for fifteen days and fifteen nights you could not make me change my mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>you</b> say. You're not stupid." [...] And then abruptly, as if {{bringing}} it out were somehow founded on that fact: [...] "We're marrying Jeanne." ...|$|R

6000|$|Yes, dearest Mr. Kenyon, we mean, if we can, {{to go to}} Rome in the autumn. It is {{very wrong}} of you not to come too, and <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>you</b> give against it {{are by no means}} conclusive. My opinion is that, {{whatever}} the term of your natural life may be, you would probably have an additional ten years fastened on to it by coming to the Continent, and so I tease you and tease you, as is natural to such an opinion. People twirl now in their arm-chairs, and the vitality in them kindles as they rush along. Remember how pleased you were when you were at Como! Don't draw a chalk circle round you and fancy you can't move. Even tables and chairs have taken to move lately, and hats spin round without a giddy head in them. Is this a time to stand still, even in the garden at Wimbledon? 'I speak to a wise man; judge what I say.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will see}} what I can make of it, when I think it over," [...] Mr. Shrewsbury said. [...] "Of course, as it stands, it is so natural and {{probable}} that it would clear you at once; {{had it not been}} for that unfortunate dog business before, and the supposition, excited by it, that you had a feeling of hostility to the squire. I shall be able partly to dispose of that, for I can swear that you have frequently spoken to me of the squire in tones of respect and liking; and that, although you regretted the manner in which you left his service, you felt no ill will against him on account of it. Moreover, I shall be able to prove that <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>you</b> gave for having your tools with you was a true one; and although I cannot swear that I expected you specially on that evening, the fact that you were in the habit of coming over, at times, to see me, cannot but corroborate your story.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{our good}} Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. She {{would not take}} a denial. She would not let Jane say, 'No;' for when Jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very morning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quite decided against {{accepting}} the offer, and for <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>you</b> mention; exactly as you say, she had {{made up her mind}} to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell's return, and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present--and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over again--and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her, saw farther than I did. It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did, and refuse to take Jane's answer; but she positively declared she would not write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her; she would wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go. Quite a surprize to me! I had not the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation, she had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word of it till it was all settled." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, and I {{can guess}} <b>the</b> <b>reason.</b> <b>You</b> {{did not keep}} your word to me, though you knew how anxious I was to {{see you at the}} end of your {{fortnight}} at Kingston; and <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> is that <b>you</b> have something on your mind which you fear to tell me--which you are ashamed to tell." ...|$|R
6000|$|COLONEL. I know, I know; but I 've been into it for myself; I've formed {{my opinion}} personally. Now, what 's <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>you</b> don't {{want me to}} invest? ...|$|R
6000|$|... “... I {{came out}} to this place so reduced by a dropsy and an asthma, [...] that I could neither sleep, breathe, eat, nor move. I most earnestly [...] desired and begged of God {{that he would take}} me. Contrary to my [...] expectation, upon venturing to ride (which I had {{forborne}} for some [...] years), I recovered my strength to a pretty considerable degree, [...] slept, and had my stomach again.... What I did, I can assure you was [...] not for life, but ease; for I am at present {{in the case of a}} man [...] that was almost in harbour, and then blown back to sea—who has a [...] reasonable hope of going to a good place, and an absolute certainty [...] of leaving a very bad one. Not that I have any particular disgust at [...] the world; for I have as great comfort in my own family and from the [...] kindness of my friends as any man; but the world, in the main, [...] displeases me, and I have too true a presentiment of calamities that [...] are to befall my country. However, if I should have the happiness to [...] see you before I die, you will find that I enjoy the comforts of [...] life with my usual cheerfulness. I cannot imagine why you are [...] frightened from a journey to England: <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>you</b> assign are not [...] sufficient—the journey I am sure would do you good.

[...] Samuel Flancher, writer of the extensive text Make My Snake Moan: 200 Haikus in Appreciation of Black Snake Moan, wrote: [...] "I love this movie/It has it all, and much more/Oh Ricci my muse." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, Luntz {{announced}} {{new research}} {{that shows the}} American people are eager for Congress to act on climate legislation that would promote US energy independence and a healthier environment.

[...] "A clear majority of Americans believe climate change is happening. This is true of McCain voters and Obama voters alike. And even those that don't still believe {{it is essential for}} America to pursue policies that promote energy independence and a cleaner, healthier environment." [...] In reference to recent political events, Luntz added: [...] "People are much more interested in seeing solutions than watching yet another partisan political argument." ...|$|E
