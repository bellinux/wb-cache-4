500|$|Jenijoy La Belle assesses Lady Macbeth's {{femininity}} {{and sexuality}} {{as they relate}} to motherhood as well as witchhood. The fact that she conjures spirits likens her to a witch, and the act itself establishes a similarity in the way that both Lady Macbeth and the Weird Sisters from the play [...] "use the metaphoric powers of language to call upon spiritual powers who in turn will influence physical events — in one case the workings of the state, in the other the workings of a woman's body." [...] Like the witches, Lady Macbeth strives to make herself an instrument for bringing about the future She proves herself a defiant, empowered nonconformist, and an explicit threat to a patriarchal system of governance in that, through challenging his masculinity, she manipulates Macbeth into murdering King Duncan. Despite the fact that she calls him a coward, Macbeth remains reluctant, until she asks: [...] "What beast wasn't, then, that made you break this enterprise to me? / When you durst do it, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a man; / And to be more than what you were, you would / Be so much more the man." [...] Thus Lady Macbeth enforces a masculine conception of power, yet only after pleading to be unsexed, or defeminised. The Weird Sisters are also depicted as defeminised, androgynous figures. They are bearded (1.3.46), (which may also be associated with Lady Macbeth's amenorrhea). Witches were perceived as an extreme type of anti-mother, even considered capable of cooking and eating their own children. Although Lady Macbeth may not express violence toward her child with that same degree of grotesqueness, she certainly expresses a sense of brutality when she states that she would smash the baby's head.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{guided tours}} {{in the cave}} were in 1894 run by the Lynches. They lasted 8 hours and were by candle or lantern. Visitors climbed through the sink hole on a [...] ladder down {{to the top of}} the pile. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{instructed}} to slide down the pile to the bottom. You received a candle to guide your way. The tours included the Egyptian Room (now the Shoe Room), the Lakes Passage, and you saw formations such as the Great White Throne (now the Liberty Bell), and the Spring Room Sentinel (now just the Sentinel). After the Hershends started tours in 1950, they removed the wooden stairs, and added concrete stairs and paths through the cave. Current tours last for about an hour, and are limited to 60 people.|$|E

2500|$|The sonnet {{begins with}} the speaker expressing lament to youth with [...] "O that you were yourself!" [...] More simply, the speaker deplores that youth isn't {{absolute}} and permanent, and with [...] "yourself", the speaker is referring to the figure of youth's soul. Following this, the speaker address the youth as [...] "love", further developing the speaker's theme of adoration and personal affection for youth. From there, the speaker tells this youth that [...] "you are / No longer yours, than you yourself here live", saying that the youth's identity is constantly fading away from him as he ages, {{as if he is}} unbecoming himself. With the lines [...] "Against this coming end you should prepare / And your sweet semblance to some other give", the speaker is simply saying that the youth's life is slipping away day after day, and if he doesn't get married and have children, he will lose his identity to his death. Continuing from this idea, the speaker says [...] "So should that beauty which you hold in lease / Find no determination; <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> / Yourself again after yourself's decease, / When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear", all meaning that whatever beauty the youth still has is only temporary (leased to him) and will be lost, unless he has children who continue the legacy and identity of his youthful beauty even after death. Continuing with [...] "Who lets so fair a house fall to decay," [...] the speaker refers to the youth as this [...] "house" [...] in reference to his fair body and his fair lineage. Adding to this, the speaker continues on with [...] "Which husbandry in honour might uphold, / Against the stormy gusts of winter's day / And barren rage of death's eternal cold?". [...] These lines suggest that by taking up marriage and becoming a husband and a father, the youth might be able to maintain his essence of youth against the devastations of time and age. This, the speaker compares to storms and winter, ending with the threat of the eternal nature of death, at which point the youth would be too late in renewing himself. In the ending couplet, the speaker mirrors his starting wail of lament in line 1 with [...] "O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know, / You had a father: let your son say so." [...] Here, the speaker is separating the youth figure he adores from those he considers foolish, or [...] "unthrifts", and connects that to the youth's inheritance, suggesting that only [...] "unthrifts" [...] would ignore their inheritance of life and youth and deny their own fathers' wish for continued lineage and legacy.|$|E
