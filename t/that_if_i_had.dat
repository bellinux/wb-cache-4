500|$|Samuel L. Jackson reprises {{his role}} as Nick Fury, the {{director}} of the super-spy agency, S.H.I.E.L.D. Kenneth Choi appears as Jim Morita, a Japanese-American member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Choi said he was the last actor to audition for the part and that he read sides from Saving Private Ryan. About his preparation for the role, Choi said, [...] " [...] did a lot of WWII research especially in regards to the 'Nisei' soldiers, or Japanese-American soldiers. I wanted to get as much true, real-life information for a guy like Jim Morita fighting in WWII. I felt <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> built a factual basis for him, I could then let go and permit the character to exist in the Marvel Universe, which allows for a lot of imaginative circumstances." [...] Bruno Ricci stars as Jacques Dernier, a French member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Ricci auditioned for and got the part while filming the French series The Hawk. JJ Feild appears as James Montgomery Falsworth, a British member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Feild called his part in the film [...] "a very physical job. I play one of the Captain's sidekicks so I've been running around shooting things and blowing things up and trying to look cool for about a year." [...] Additionally, Toby Jones was cast as Arnim Zola, a biochemist for the Nazi party, Richard Armitage portrays Heinz Kruger, the Red Skull's top assassin, Lex Shrapnel portrays Gilmore Hodge, a candidate for the super soldier program, Michael Brandon portrays Brandt, a United States Senator who recognizes the PR potential of Captain America, Natalie Dormer portrays Lorraine, a private who attempts to seduce Rogers, and Jenna Coleman appears as Connie, Bucky's date at the World Expo. Jeff Goldblum had originally been approached to play Brandt, before being cast as Grandmaster in [...] Stan Lee has a cameo appearance as a general.|$|E
2500|$|In {{practice}} {{these arguments}} are often fallacious {{and rely on}} the veracity of the supporting premise. For example, the argument <b>that</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> just sat on a wild porcupine then I would know it; in fact I do not know it; therefore I did not just sit on a wild porcupine is probably not a fallacy and depends entirely on the veracity of the leading proposition that supports it.

2500|$|Beckett {{refrained from}} elaborating on the {{characters}} beyond {{what he had}} written in the play. He once recalled that when Sir Ralph Richardson [...] "wanted the low-down on Pozzo, his home address and curriculum vitae, and seemed to make the forthcoming of this and similar information the condition of his condescending to illustrate the part of Vladimir ... I told him that all I knew about Pozzo was in the text, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> known more I would have {{put it in the}} text, and that was true also of the other characters." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the age of}} 20, when {{he passed}} through Vilnius, his fame preceded him. Both Rabbi Eliyahu Eliezer Grodnenski [...] the leading Rav of Vilna and the {{son-in-law}} of Rabbi Yisroel Salanter [...] and Rabbi Elinke Levinsohn of Kretinga desired the young Torah prodigy for their own son-in-law. The two went to Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor of Kovno to decide which family would merit this honor. After hearing each one's position, Rabbi Spector asked to meet Rabbi Grodzinski, and spoke at length with him on various Torah topics. Afterward, Rabbi Spector told the two prospective fathers-in-law: [...] "The truth is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a daughter to marry off, I would take him and leave you both out in the cold. Since I have no such daughter, however, I have decided {{in favor of the}} Rav of Vilna".|$|E
2500|$|Neither critics nor {{the public}} responded enthusiastically, {{although}} Robert Osborne {{has stated that}} the film was a success when he hosted a telecast of it on Turner Classic Movies. Graham Greene wrote that he was [...] "less than ever convinced {{that there is an}} aesthetic justification for filming Shakespeare at all... the effect of even the best scenes is to distract." [...] Cinemagoers considered the film too [...] "arty", staying away as they had from Warner's A Midsummer Night Dream a year before: leading to Hollywood abandoning the Bard for over a decade. The film nevertheless received four Oscar nominations. Subsequent film versions would make use of less experienced, but more photogenic, actors in the central roles. Cukor, interviewed in 1970, said of his film: [...] "It's one picture <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to do over again, I'd know how. I'd get the garlic and the Mediterranean into it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Within the Government doubts quickly {{began to}} be voiced about the justice of his treatment. [...] Even his Secretary of State and the Prime Minister in 1936, Baldwin, wrote letters admitting that their {{decision}} had been wrong. As former Prime Minister, Sir Stanley Baldwin later wrote [...] "I feel it only right to say <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> had the full evidence before me which has now been made available, I should not have taken the decision I reluctantly did". Writing in November 1937, Lord Hankey stated [...] "the more I think about it the more I feel that the punishment did not fit the crime". In December 1938, the Marquess of Londonderry – the Secretary of State for Air {{at the time of}} the dismissal – wrote privately to Baldwin [...] "... was most unjustly treated and was the victim of the inveterate hatred of a civil servant Sir Warren Fisher who should never have been allowed to encompass his downfall, as he undoubtedly did." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reflecting on {{his first}} six novels and his rapid writing {{turnover}} later in his career, DeLillo remarked, [...] "I wasn't learning {{to slow down and}} examine what I was doing more closely. I don't have regrets about that work, but I do think <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been a bit less hasty in starting each new book, I might have produced somewhat better work in the 1970s. My first novel took so long and was such an effort that once I was free of it I almost became carefree in a sense and moved right through the decade, stopping, in a way, only at Ratner's Star (1976), which was an enormous challenge for me, and probably a bigger challenge for the reader. But I slowed down in the 1980s and '90s." [...] DeLillo has also acknowledged some of the weaknesses of his 1970s works, reflecting in 2007: [...] "I knew I wasn’t doing utterly serious work, let me put it that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{spending}} 10 {{months as}} a trainee, IU released [...] "Lost Child" [...] (...) as her first single. She performed the song {{live for the}} first time on the music program, M! Countdown, on September 18, 2008, making it her debut performance as a professional singer. Regarding the performance, IU recalled the crowd had hurled insults at her and though she felt discouraged by it, she now considers it a beneficial experience. [...] "Lost Child" [...] is the lead single from her debut extended play Lost and Found, which was released on September 24, 2008. For the album, IU was awarded the [...] "Rookie of the Month" [...] by South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism in November 2008. However, the album did not do well commercially. During an interview in 2011, IU said, [...] "My first album failed, but I'm grateful for <b>that.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> become successful as soon as I made my debut, I wouldn't appreciate my staff members and the popularity that I'm enjoying now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking in the House of Commons in 1937, Churchill said, [...] "I {{will not}} pretend <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{to choose between}} {{communism}} and Nazism, I would choose communism." [...] In a 1935 essay, [...] "Hitler and his Choice", which was republished in his 1937 book Great Contemporaries, Churchill expressed a hope that Hitler, if he so chose, and despite his rise to power through dictatorial action, hatred and cruelty, might yet [...] "go {{down in history as}} the man who restored honour and peace of mind to the great Germanic nation and brought it back serene, helpful and strong to the forefront of the European family circle." [...] His first major speech on defence on 7 February 1934 stressed the need to rebuild the Royal Air Force and to create a Ministry of Defence; his second, on 13 July urged a renewed role for the League of Nations. These three topics remained his themes until early 1936. In 1935, {{he was one of the}} founding members of The Focus, which brought together people of differing political backgrounds and occupations who were united in seeking [...] "the defence of freedom and peace." [...] The Focus led to the formation of the much wider Arms and the Covenant Movement in 1936.|$|E

2500|$|Foster also {{acted in}} another film {{nominated}} for the Palme d'Or in 1976, Bugsy Malone. The British musical parodied films about Prohibition Era gangsters by having all roles played by children; Foster appeared in a major supporting role as a star of a speakeasy show. Its director Alan Parker was impressed by her, saying that [...] "she takes such an intelligent interest {{in the way the}} film is being made <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been run over by a bus I think she was probably the only person on the set able to take over as director." [...] She gained several positive notices for her performance: Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that [...] "at thirteen she was already getting the roles that grown-up actresses complained weren't being written for women anymore", Variety described her as [...] "outstanding", and Vincent Canby of The New York Times called her [...] "the star of the show". Foster's two BAFTAs were awarded jointly for her performances in Taxi Driver and Bugsy Malone. Her third film release in spring 1976 was the independent drama Echoes of a Summer, which had been filmed two years previously. The New York Times named Foster's performance as a terminally ill girl the film's [...] "main strength" [...] and Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune stated that she [...] "is not a good child actress; she's just a good actress", although both reviewers otherwise panned the film.|$|E
2500|$|Taking {{his seat}} in the House of Lords, Fitzwilliam {{attended}} almost every notable debate, signing nearly every protest which the opposition used but never made a speech during Lord North's premiership. He supported John Wilkes in his fight to keep the seat {{he was elected to}} and supported the American Colonies in their dispute with Britain. On 8 July 1776 he asked Lord Rockingham to arrange for a remonstrance to be sent to the King when war broke out in America, so the Americans would see [...] "that there is still in the country a body of men of the first rank and importance, who would still wish to govern them according to the old policy". George Selwyn MP recorded that on 6 March 1782 he had been confronted by Fitzwilliam at the Brooks's and had to listen to Fitzwilliam on the dire state of the nation: [...] "I do not know if he was in earnest, but I suppose that he was. He had worked himself up to commiserate the state of the country, nay, that of the king himself, [...] that I expected every instant that his heart would have burst". When Selwyn asked Fitzwilliam [...] "if there was a possibility of salvation in any position in which our affairs could be placed", Fitzwilliam [...] "asked me...with the utmost impetuosity, what objection I had to Lord Rock being sent for. You may be pretty sure, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> any, I should not have made it".|$|E
