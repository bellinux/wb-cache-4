5|$|In September 994 Michael Bourtzes, the Byzantine {{military}} governor (doux) of Antioch and northern Syria, suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of the Orontes {{at the hands}} of the Fatimid general Manjutakin. This Fatimid victory shook the Byzantine position in Syria, and posed a grave <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> Arab vassal, the Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo. To prevent its fall, Emperor Basil II himself intervened in the region in 995, forcing Manjutakin to retire to Damascus. After capturing Shayzar, Hims and Rafaniya, and building a new fortress at Antartus, the emperor withdrew, leaving Damian Dalassenos as the new doux of Antioch.|$|E
5|$|The JNA's {{offensive}} operations, directly {{associated with}} the campaign in the east Croatian region of Slavonia, were launched on 20 September. The assault on Croatian positions in Vukovar gradually became the main effort of the campaign as the JNA was repeatedly unable to capture the city. The fighting in and around Vukovar lasted months and eventually drew in the JNA's main armoured force, which had previously been slated to advance west towards Serb-held areas in western Slavonia. In addition to relieving its Vukovar garrison, the JNA wished to dissipate the Croatian forces in the city {{so that they would}} not pose any <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> rear in the event that the campaign progressed west of Vinkovci.|$|E
5|$|The blacknose shark {{has never}} been implicated in an attack on humans. However, caution should be {{exercised}} if it begins to perform a threat display. This species {{is regarded as a}} game fish and offers a respectable fight on light tackle (a more delicate fishing line). It is also of regional commercial importance, being taken intentionally and as bycatch via gillnets and surface longlines across its range, most significantly off southwestern Florida, Venezuela, and Brazil; the meat is sold dried and salted. Large numbers of blacknose sharks are also caught incidentally by shrimp trawlers, which may pose a greater <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> population, as many of the sharks taken are immature.|$|E

5|$|Jagiello's baptism {{failed to}} end the crusade of the Teutonic Knights, who claimed his {{conversion}} was a sham, perhaps even a heresy, and renewed their incursions on the pretext that pagans remained in Lithuania. From then on, however, the Order found it harder to sustain {{the cause of a}} crusade and faced the growing <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> existence posed by the Kingdom of Poland and a genuinely Christian Lithuania alliance. Władysław sponsored the creation of the diocese of Vilnius under bishop Andrzej Wasilko, the former confessor of Elisabeth of Hungary. The bishopric, which included Samogitia, then largely controlled by the Teutonic Order, was subordinated to the see of Gniezno and not to that of Teutonic Königsberg. The decision may not have improved Władysław's relations with the Order, but it served to introduce closer ties between Lithuania and Poland, enabling the Polish church to freely assist its Lithuanian counterpart.|$|E
5|$|Out in the Atlantic, the {{detached}} squadrons of Nielly (French) and Montagu (British) were commerce raiding against enemy merchant shipping, but had {{thus far}} {{failed to find}} the main food convoy. Nielly encountered a British convoy from Newfoundland and took ten ships as prizes—including the convoy escort, the 32-gun frigate HMS Castor. Thomas Troubridge, captain of the Castor, would spend the entire campaign aboard Nielly's flagship Sans Pareil. Montagu also met with some success on 15 May, recapturing the merchant ships Nielly had taken, along with the French corvette Marie-Guiton and accurate intelligence on the direction {{and size of the}} French convoy which Montagu immediately passed to Howe. Resuming his patrol in the Mid-Atlantic, Nielly found the convoy from America a few days later, and transferred two of his ships to Vanstabel's escort to augment the convoy's defences. He then returned to the Eastern Atlantic to look for signs of British activity which might pose a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> passage. He also dispatched frigates to Villaret, carrying information about the convoy's location and speed.|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} is not aggressive, {{though it}} will defend itself if stepped on or otherwise incited. Its tail spine can inflict an excruciating injury, and can easily pierce leather or rubber footwear. The paralytic venom delivered may have potentially life-threatening effects on those with heart or respiratory problems, and {{is the subject of}} biomedical and neurobiological research. This species is popular with ecotourist divers. Abundant and widespread, the bluntnose stingray is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries operating in nearshore U.S. waters; these activities are not a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> population, as most captured rays are released alive. The impact of fishing in the southern parts of its range is uncertain, but is unlikely to significantly affect the species as a whole as these activities occur outside its centers of distribution. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the bluntnose stingray as of Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|The {{initial address}} {{received}} a mixed reception within the Congo. In some quarters {{it was widely}} supported. However, some believed that it merely highlighted the fact that Lumumba was inexperienced (and overly provocative) in comparison with Kasa-Vubu's measured and diplomatic approach. Members of Lumumba's own party, including Kanza, praised the speech itself but believed that the venue in which it had been delivered was inappropriate. Lumumba's address was also notably acclaimed by figures within the international Pan-African and Black Power movements including Malcolm X. The speech may have further heightened racial violence between white settlers and native Congolese which were already distrustful. As {{a result of the}} <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> expatriates, Belgium deployed troops to the country and, amid mounting violence, several regions of the Congo, notably Katanga, seceded and declared their own independence, starting five-years of violence and political unrest known as the Congo Crisis.|$|E
5|$|The non-aligned Indonesian {{government}} of Sukarno {{was faced with}} a major <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> legitimacy beginning in 1956, when several regional commanders began to demand autonomy from Jakarta. After mediation failed, Sukarno took action to remove the dissident commanders. In February 1958, dissident military commanders in Central Sumatera (Colonel Ahmad Hussein) and North Sulawesi (Colonel Ventje Sumual) declared the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia-Permesta Movement aimed at overthrowing the Sukarno regime. They were joined by many civilian politicians from the Masyumi Party, such as Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, who were opposed to the growing influence of the communist Partai Komunis Indonesia party. Due to their anti-communist rhetoric, the rebels received arms, funding, and other covert aid from the CIA until Allen Lawrence Pope, an American pilot, was shot down after a bombing raid on government-held Ambon in April 1958. The central government responded by launching airborne and seaborne military invasions of rebel strongholds Padang and Manado. By the end of 1958, the rebels were militarily defeated, and the last remaining rebel guerilla bands surrendered by August 1961.|$|E

Furthermore, the company was seeking to counter the <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> sales by newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into sales.

President Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, but he said it was too early to tell whether the changes have been successful. Despite the Chicken Whopper's initial success, just over a year after the its introduction, enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King's largest franchisee, Carrols Corporation, was complaining that the product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name.|$|E

5|$|The Commonwealth Navy {{was small}} and played a {{relatively}} minor role {{in the history of}} the Commonwealth. Despite having access to the Baltic Sea, neither Poland nor Lithuania had any significant navy throughout their histories. In the 16th century, as Poland and Lithuania became involved in conflicts in Livonia, Polish king Sigismund II Augustus supported the operations of privateers, but that met with opposition of the Poland's primary port, Gdańsk (Danzig), which saw them as a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> trade operations. This led to the development of a privateer port in Puck. At the turn of the century, Poland became ruled by the House of Vasa, and was involved in a series of wars with Sweden (see also dominium maris baltici). Vasa kings attempted to create a proper fleet, and Władysław IV Vasa built a dedicated port for the royal navy (Władysławowo), but their attempts met with repeated failures, due to lack of funds in the royal treasury (seeing little need for the fleet, Polish nobility refused to raise taxes for its construction, and Gdańsk continued its opposition to the idea of a royal fleet). Although Władysław bought 12 ships, they were sold between 1641 and 1643, marking the end of the Commonwealth Navy.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} is {{considered}} to be vulnerable due to habitat destruction, its isolated populations, collection of adults, predation, and a low breeding success rate. Its habitat is being destroyed to create large agricultural fields and cocoa plantations, as well as for logging and slash-and-burn agriculture. Due to the highly specialized requirements for its habitat, its population is very fragmented, and the species is believed to be naturally rare. Competition for its nesting sites is a result of these strict requirements and can lead to infanticide. Its estimated population is between 2,500 and 10,000 individuals, though it is believed that the population is {{at the lower end of}} the estimate. However, due to the inaccessibility of some parts of its range, it is also possible that this species is more common than believed. The population of some of these colonies is reaching the minimum levels needed for long-term viability. It also falls victim to spring traps set for mammals by hunters. However, a more serious <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> numbers was the widespread collection of rockfowl for display in zoos in the 1950s and 1960s. There is a risk that it will be negatively affected by ecotourism due to disturbances in its daily routine if proper viewing procedures are not followed.|$|E
