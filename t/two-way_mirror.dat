5|$|Meanwhile, Alison and Diana Gordon {{are being}} held captive in their home by Zep, who is {{watching}} Adam and Lawrence through a camera behind a <b>two-way</b> <b>mirror</b> in the bathroom. The house is simultaneously being watched by Tapp, who has since been discharged from the force. Flashbacks show that Tapp became obsessed with the Jigsaw case after hearing Amanda's testimony, and eventually found Jigsaw's warehouse using the videotape from her game. He and Sing entered the warehouse, where they apprehended Jigsaw and saved a man from a drill trap, but Jigsaw escaped after non-fatally slashing Tapp's throat, and Sing {{was killed by a}} quadruple shotgun walkway while pursuing him. Convinced that Lawrence is Jigsaw, Tapp began stalking him after his discharge.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not until}} Deathly Hallows that Aberforth plays an {{important}} role in the series by taking Harry, Ron and Hermione into his bar before the Death Eaters can capture them. Aberforth later reveals to the trio some facts they did not know about the history of the Dumbledore family. While being held prisoner in Malfoy Manor, Harry briefly glimpses Aberforth's eye in the remaining shard of the <b>two-way</b> <b>mirror</b> he was given by Sirius and calls for Aberforth's help. Aberforth bought its counterpart from Mundungus Fletcher. Using the mirror to watch over the trio, Aberforth sends Dobby to rescue them and the other prisoners from the Manor. He liked Dobby and was upset to hear Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.|$|E
500|$|The video {{ends with}} the camera zooming out of the club to reveal a <b>two-way</b> <b>mirror</b> with Eminem and Dr. Dre in white lab uniforms, observing 50 Cent and taking notes. Atwell stated that [...] "seeing 50 with Dre and Em having his back is as big a visual {{statement}} {{as it is a}} musical statement" [...] and the shot was significant because it made clear the club was inside the center and not unrelated performance footage. On January 27, 2003, the video debuted on MTV's Total Request Live at number nine and stayed on the chart for fifty days. It also reached number one on the MuchMusic video charts. At the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was awarded Best Rap Video and Best New Artist and was nominated for Video of the Year, Best Male Video, and Viewer's Choice. Cameos include: Dr. Dre, Eminem, D12, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, The Game (in his first cameo appearance), Bang' Em Smurf, Young Buck, Xzibit and DJ Whoo Kid.|$|E

2500|$|Until 2003, Walken had a {{recurring}} SNL sketch called [...] "The Continental", in which Walken played a [...] "suave ladies' man" [...] who in reality cannot {{do anything to}} keep a woman (a neighbor in his apartment building) from giving him the cold shoulder. Though he is outwardly chivalrous, his more perverted tendencies inevitably drive away his date over his pleading objections. For instance, he invites the woman to wash up in his bathroom; once she is inside, it becomes obvious that the bathroom mirror is a <b>two-way</b> <b>mirror</b> when he is seen lighting up a cigarette. In [...] "The Continental", only the hand of his neighbor is ever seen; the camera always shows her point of view.|$|E
2500|$|Leo Sayer (born Gerard Hugh Sayer, 21 May 1948) is a singer, who {{had success}} in the 1970s with hits such as [...] "When I Need You", [...] "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing", [...] "Moonlighting" [...] and [...] "Thunder in My Heart". Leo found it {{difficult}} to sleep on his first night in the house as he was forced to share a bed with Donny who was naked, a prospect that Leo found uncomfortable. Leo was a servant during the Master and Servant task. He reverted to mime communication and decided to take a vow of silence, much to the confusion and annoyance of other housemates. He escaped from the house by breaking open a fire door with a broom after hitting a <b>two-way</b> <b>mirror</b> on Day 10, when Big Brother refused to provide him with clean underwear. It was revealed later that he already overlooked clean underwear in his suitcase. He was up for eviction at the time and, though he did not know it, leading the poll.|$|E

50|$|One can {{configure}} ASM diskgroups to have {{no redundancy}} (external), <b>two-way</b> <b>mirroring</b> (normal), or three-way mirroring (high). In the case of normal and high mirrors, good practice suggests having fail groups that talk to different controllers for performance and fail-safe reasons.|$|R

25|$|Another {{theme in}} the show is Sam's {{confusion}} about police work in 1973, as he often mistakenly mentions techniques and technologies that were not used in 1973, such as <b>two-way</b> <b>mirrors.</b> One such theme is that Sam continually gives criminals the updated version {{of the right to}} silence warning, which was changed in 1994. When he does so, someone around him usually points out that he is giving the warning incorrectly.|$|R

50|$|The {{girls were}} also given a modern kitchen that had pink lights above the stove {{instead of the}} white lights {{that are used in}} American homes.

Throughout the entire house, all seven girls are only given one walk-in closet. In the make-up room there are two, <b>two-way</b> <b>mirrors,</b> which the girls do not know about and believe that it is a private mirror.|$|R
2500|$|One-way mirrors [...] (also called <b>two-way</b> <b>mirrors)</b> work by {{overwhelming}} dim {{transmitted light}} with bright reflected light. A true one-way mirror that actually allows light to be transmitted {{in one direction}} only without requiring external energy is not possible as it violates the second law of thermodynamics: if one placed a cold object on the transmitting side and a hot one on the blocked side, radiant energy would be transferred from the cold to the hot object. Thus, though a one-way mirror {{can be made to}} appear to work in only one direction at a time, it is actually reflective from either side.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{discipline}} of sociology, which has shaped the comprehension of modernity as intrinsically a secular process of change, faces today new challenges {{raised by the}} revival of religion in general and Islam in particular. In the last three decades, by means of religious claims of Muslim migrants and new controversies in the public life, Islam, an external reference, is becoming an indigenous one in Europe public life. The intimate encounters between Islam and Europe engender a mutual transformation that call for a <b>two-way</b> <b>mirroring</b> and intercultural reflexivity, only possible by means of liberating European narrative of modernity - and sociology - from their colonial frame and universalist claim...|$|R
5000|$|Of his {{preparations}} for Jimmy Dean, Altman added, [...] "I didn't {{do what they}} told me I had to do, I hired the people I wanted." [...] The production was his first to involve Pierre Mignot, a Canadian cinematographer; they would both collaborate on five more films. Filming took place on just one set: a [...] "redressed" [...] version of its Broadway counterpart. Altman used Super 16 equipment during the nineteen-day shoot; this was later converted to 35 mm stock for the first answer print. For the film's flashbacks, he built a double set with <b>two-way</b> <b>mirrors</b> that were controlled by computerized lighting techniques—which became problematic for both him and the film's critics.|$|R
