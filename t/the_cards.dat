5|$|Syaoran Li, a boy Sakura's age and {{descendant}} of Clow Reed, arrives from Hong Kong to recapture <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> himself. While initially antagonistic, {{he comes to}} respect Sakura and begins aiding her to capture <b>the</b> <b>cards.</b> Once Sakura captures all of <b>the</b> <b>cards,</b> she is tested by Yue, the cards' second guardian, to determine if she is worthy of becoming the cards' true master; Yue is also the true form of Yukito Tsukishiro, Toya's best friend. Aided by her teacher Kaho Mizuki, Sakura passes the test and becomes the new master of the Clow Cards.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, Eriol Hiiragizawa, a {{transfer}} student from England, arrives in Tomoeda and begins causing disturbances with two guardian-like creatures, Spinel Sun and Ruby Moon. Sakura is suddenly unable {{to use the}} Clow Cards and transforms her wand, beginning the process of evolving <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> into Sakura Cards as Eriol causes strange occurrences that forces her to use and thus transform certain cards. Once all <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> have been transformed, Eriol tells Sakura that he aided her in converting <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> so they would not lose their magic powers. Syaoran later confesses his love to Sakura, who comes to realize she also loves him. Cardcaptor Sakura concludes with Syaoran returning to Hong Kong with a promise to return. Two years later, Syaoran moves back to Tomoeda permanently.|$|E
5|$|The rest of <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> (7-6-5-4-2) {{are called}} cartas blancas (white cards) because their value is zero round points.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> term stored-value <b>card</b> {{means that}} <b>the</b> funds and or data are {{physically}} stored on <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> With prepaid <b>cards</b> <b>the</b> data is maintained on computers controlled by <b>the</b> <b>card</b> issuer. <b>The</b> value stored on <b>the</b> <b>card</b> {{can be accessed}} using a magnetic stripe embedded in <b>the</b> <b>card,</b> on which <b>the</b> <b>card</b> number is encoded; using radio-frequency identification (RFID); or by entering a code number, printed on <b>the</b> <b>card,</b> into a telephone or other numeric keypad.|$|R
50|$|In Generals Order, {{there are}} six {{different}} type of <b>card</b> categories, namely <b>the</b> character <b>card,</b> <b>the</b> event/strategy <b>card,</b> <b>the</b> special <b>card,</b> <b>the</b> equipment <b>card,</b> <b>the</b> advantageous <b>card,</b> and <b>the</b> command/order <b>card.</b> Any deck can only have up to 3 of <b>the</b> exactly same <b>card.</b>|$|R
50|$|The CSC {{for each}} card (form 1 and 2) is {{generated}} by <b>the</b> <b>card</b> issuer when <b>the</b> <b>card</b> is issued. It is calculated by encrypting <b>the</b> bank <b>card</b> number and expiration date (two fields printed on <b>the</b> <b>card)</b> with encryption keys known only to <b>the</b> <b>card</b> issuer, and decimalising the result.|$|R
5|$|The slogan of Octopus Card Limited and its {{products}} (<b>the</b> <b>cards)</b> is Making Everyday Life Easier, {{which is part}} of the mission statement of the corporation.|$|E
5|$|After {{a player}} makes the first baza, that player {{is allowed to}} {{announce}} declarations. Declaring is allowed until the last two cards are left in the stock (the last faced-down card, and the faced-up trump below it). After these final two cards are picked up, all of <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> the players hold must be played in order to finish the round. When the round is over, the players start to count their scores (see Scoring below). After the counting ends, and their scores are calculated, <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> in the bazas are mixed again in a single stock to be dealt {{at the start of}} the next round.|$|E
5|$|In this test, {{a number}} of cards are {{presented}} to the participants. The figures on <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> differ with respect to color, quantity, and shape. The participants are then given a pile of additional cards and are asked to match each one {{to one of the}} previous cards. Typically, children between ages nine and eleven demonstrate the cognitive flexibility needed for this test.|$|E
50|$|The {{terminal}} {{sends the}} get processing options command to <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> When issuing this command, the terminal supplies <b>the</b> <b>card</b> with any data elements requested by <b>the</b> <b>card</b> in <b>the</b> processing options data objects list (PDOL). The PDOL ({{a list of}} tags and lengths of data elements) is optionally provided by <b>the</b> <b>card</b> to <b>the</b> terminal during application selection. <b>The</b> <b>card</b> responds with <b>the</b> application interchange profile (AIP), a list of functions to perform in processing <b>the</b> transaction. <b>The</b> <b>card</b> also provides <b>the</b> application file locator (AFL), a list of files and records that the terminal needs to read from <b>the</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1976, three {{collectors}} {{discovered a}} T206 Wagner that featured Wagner {{in a different}} pose, never seen in any of <b>the</b> other <b>cards.</b> Although a Library of Congress expert said the paper on <b>the</b> <b>card</b> dated back to 1910, the three men decided to submit <b>the</b> <b>card</b> for a water test, using chemicals to determine <b>the</b> <b>card's</b> authenticity. <b>The</b> <b>card</b> broke apart, and as a result, <b>the</b> <b>card</b> was dismissed as a fake. The three men were respected collectors and were cleared of any wrongdoing by <b>the</b> <b>card</b> collecting community.|$|R

5|$|Strensham {{was one of}} two test sites {{chosen by}} RoadChef for a new loyalty card scheme in 2005. <b>The</b> <b>cards</b> {{themselves}} used new technology to physically display the points total on the card. The loyalty scheme is no longer in use today.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} {{supposed}} to find five Tarot cards in the game in order to solve a crucial puzzle. Each card triggers a cut-scene. When collected, they are arranged in a nine-pane grid to solve the puzzle. The difficulty level determines what clues are given and what order <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> need to be laid out.|$|E
5|$|The {{total of}} the round points the player (or pair) has gained is {{calculated}} as the sum of values of <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> collected in the baza and {{the values of the}} declared combinations. The winner of the last trick also receives ten bonus round points. The total value of the deck (and thus the maximum amount of round points) is 230 points.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>card</b> {{security}} code {{is typically}} {{the last three}} or four digits printed, not embossed like <b>the</b> <b>card</b> number, on <b>the</b> signature strip on the back of <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> On American Express <b>cards,</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> security code is the four digits printed (not embossed) on the front towards <b>the</b> right. <b>The</b> <b>card</b> security code is not encoded on the magnetic stripe but is printed flat.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} season, {{if a player}} chose to take <b>the</b> top <b>card</b> instead of <b>the</b> <b>card</b> in play, <b>the</b> <b>card</b> and {{category}} it was behind remained in play. Afterward, <b>the</b> <b>card</b> {{was taken off the}} board regardless.|$|R
50|$|The {{first six}} digits of a <b>card</b> number (including <b>the</b> initial MII digit) {{are known as}} the issuer {{identification}} number (IIN). These identify <b>the</b> <b>card</b> issuing institution that issued <b>the</b> <b>card</b> to <b>the</b> <b>card</b> holder. <b>The</b> rest of the number is allocated by <b>the</b> <b>card</b> issuer. <b>The</b> <b>card</b> numbers length is its number of digits. Many <b>card</b> issuers print <b>the</b> entire IIN and account number on their card.|$|R
5|$|A {{couple weeks}} later {{and during the}} full moon of September 19, 2013 an update was {{released}} which revealed limited edition railcards featuring promotional images of the film. <b>The</b> <b>cards</b> were scheduled to go on sale at the Shimbashi and Toyosu train stations between October 1 and 31, 2013. They granted a bearer access to the New Transit Yurikamome train which connects to the artificial island of Odaiba in Tokyo Bay between Minato and Kōtō in Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|An early {{criticism}} of the SmarTrip cards had been that they were only sold at suburban Metrorail stations, online, a few selected retailers, and Metro sales offices. However, in 2008, Metro reached an agreement with CVS/pharmacy to sell <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> at 187 DC-area locations {{in an effort to}} increase SmarTrip use. The SmarTrip cards are also sold at area grocery store chains. In late 2012 WMATA installed SmarTrip vending machines at all Metrorail stations.|$|E
5|$|Carmen and José enter {{with the}} smugglers and their booty ("Écoute, écoute, compagnons"); Carmen {{has now become}} bored with José and tells him scornfully that he {{should go back to}} his mother. Frasquita and Mercédès amuse {{themselves}} by reading their fortunes from the cards; Carmen joins them and finds that <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> are foretelling her death, and José's. The women depart to suborn the customs officers who are watching the locality. José is placed on guard duty.|$|E
50|$|Switch/Maestro cards {{issued by}} certain banks carried an issue {{number on the}} bottom of <b>the</b> <b>card</b> {{corresponding}} to <b>the</b> number of times a card had been issued on a particular account. This was usually because the current account number <b>the</b> <b>card</b> was linked to actually formed a large part of <b>the</b> <b>card</b> number, and therefore <b>the</b> <b>card</b> number could not be readily changed in case of loss or <b>the</b> <b>card</b> expiring.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>card</b> reader {{should be}} {{constructed}} {{in such a}} way as to prevent someone monitoring the communications to <b>the</b> <b>card</b> by inserting a monitoring device into <b>the</b> <b>card</b> slot.|$|R
5000|$|Clipper {{utilizes}} a NXP Semiconductors MIFARE DESFire (MF3ICD40) {{integrated circuit}} to manufacture <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> <b>The</b> <b>card</b> operates on <b>the</b> 13.56 MHz range {{putting it into}} the Near Field Communication category (rather than RFID, as is commonly misconceived). Because <b>the</b> <b>card</b> uses NFC technology, any NFC-enabled device can read the serial number, travel history, and current balance on <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> [...] However, data cannot be written to <b>the</b> <b>card</b> without <b>the</b> proper encryption key, preventing unauthorized access to funds on <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> <b>The</b> former Translink <b>cards,</b> while still functional on the fare system readers, {{do not conform to}} MIFARE and are unreadable by 13.56 MHz readers.|$|R
5|$|Despite this, the Scottish Government {{refused to}} pay for {{concessionary}} travel for the tram scheme, as it does for all bus routes in Scotland. Talks between the Scottish Government and Edinburgh Council eventually decided that concession cards should be valid for tram travel, but {{that they should be}} paid for by the Council instead of the Government. It was revealed on 15 August 2013 that <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> would be valid, and that travel would be paid for by Edinburgh Council. However, only people with cards issued in Edinburgh would be able to use them. This compromise upset many people in the Lothians, who often commute or travel into Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|Hiddleston {{lives in}} the Belsize Park area of north-west London. He {{was one of the}} celebrities (alongside Benedict Cumberbatch, E. L. James and Rachel Riley, among others) to design and sign his own card for the UK-based charity the Thomas Coram Foundation for Children. The {{campaign}} was launched by crafting company Stampin' Up! UK and <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> were auctioned off on eBay during May 2014. He is also a UK ambassador of the humanitarian and developmental assistance fund group UNICEF. He travelled to Guinea in early 2013 to help women and children and raise awareness about hunger and malnutrition. Hiddleston is a self-described feminist.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, {{bookseller}} Waterstones asked Rowling and 12 {{other writers}} (Sebastian Faulks, Doris Lessing, Lisa Appignanesi, Margaret Atwood, Lauren Child, Richard Ford, Neil Gaiman, Nick Hornby, Michael Rosen, Axel Scheffler, Tom Stoppard and Irvine Welsh) {{to compose a}} short piece of their own choosing on a single A5 card, which would then be sold at auction in aid of the charities Dyslexia Action and English PEN. Rowling's contribution was an 800-word Harry Potter prequel that concerns Harry's father, James Potter, and godfather, Sirius Black, and takes place three years before Harry was born. <b>The</b> <b>cards</b> were collated and sold for charity in book form in August 2008.|$|E
50|$|The {{balance on}} <b>the</b> <b>card</b> is {{displayed}} when the user enters the ticket gate this way. The minimum fare is needed on <b>the</b> <b>card</b> when entering <b>the</b> train system, {{which is not}} deducted at that time. The balance is also displayed whenever <b>the</b> <b>card</b> is inserted into the ticket or fare adjustment machines as well. A travel record is stored on <b>the</b> <b>card,</b> and can be displayed or printed {{out at the same}} place where one can purchase and reload Suica. On exit, <b>the</b> <b>card</b> is again passed over <b>the</b> <b>card</b> reader. At this time the fare is deducted from the remaining balance from <b>the</b> <b>card</b> and <b>the</b> new balance is displayed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>card</b> is in <b>the</b> {{format of}} a smart card, and {{is similar to}} that of a credit <b>card.</b> <b>The</b> <b>card</b> {{contains}} a variety of information about <b>the</b> <b>card</b> holder.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>card</b> is {{decorated}} with poppies and butterflies. There is a circular area that is cut out so {{that some of the}} text inside <b>the</b> <b>card</b> is visible. Three edges of <b>the</b> <b>card</b> are scalloped. <b>The</b> message inside <b>the</b> <b>card</b> reads: God give thee peace to-day, Happen whate'er there may, On Him thy spirit stay, As strikes each hour. Charlotte Murray. <b>The</b> <b>card</b> is signed: Wishing dearest Annaly a very happy Christmas...|$|R
5|$|In the Dimensional Change Card Sorting Task (DCCS), {{children}} are initially asked to sort cards {{by a single}} dimension (such as color), and are subsequently required to alter their strategy to sort cards based on a second dimension (such as shape). Typically, three-year-old {{children are}} able to sort cards based on a single dimension, but are unable to switch to sort <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> based on a second dimension. However, five-year-old children are able to sort cards based on one dimension and can then switch to sorting cards on a second dimension.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Channel was {{developed}} by Nintendo subsidiary Ambrella and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. It was created both {{to serve as a}} spiritual successor to Hey You, Pikachu!—a similar digital pet-type game wherein the player plays with a Pikachu—and to promote the Nintendo e-Reader peripheral device. The game included three e-Reader-compatible cards, but not the e-Reader device itself. When scanned, <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> upload new templates for the player to paint and for Smeargle to critique.|$|E
5|$|Starting September 1, 2012, Metro began {{offering}} $3 rebates to customers who registered their cards online after purchase. <b>The</b> <b>cards</b> still cost $5, but a $3 credit was refunded to the card {{five days after}} first use. Also starting Sep 1, riders have been required to have a minimum balance of $1.20 on their SmarTrip cards (35¢ for half-fare senior/disabled cards) in order to enter the Metrorail system, which reduced the possible negative balance upon exit.|$|E
5000|$|In Sweden, <b>the</b> <b>card</b> issuer shall {{compensate}} <b>the</b> <b>card</b> holder for fraudulent usage. The {{exception is}} if <b>the</b> <b>card</b> holder handled <b>the</b> <b>card</b> in a careless way, which can include leaving a hand bag with <b>the</b> <b>card</b> {{out of sight}} in a public place. Then <b>the</b> <b>card</b> holder must take the loss, normally limited to 12000 SEK ( [...] USD), but unlimited in case of serious carelessness. Credit card purchases are normally verified by a PIN code or identity card in Sweden. If such a check was not performed (which is normal for internet purchases) the merchant must take the loss.|$|R
30|$|CU starts {{working with}} <b>the</b> <b>card</b> {{initialization}} module. On receiving the Reset signal, CU activates the CINM and it issues the initialization commands to <b>the</b> <b>card</b> {{in order to}} initialize it in SPI mode. <b>The</b> <b>card</b> responds to every command and on completion of initialization procedure, the module receives the final response from <b>the</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R
50|$|The game {{rules are}} quite simple: Use {{your hands to}} flap <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>card</b> jumps to another side, you win. Otherwise <b>the</b> <b>card</b> stays on same side, which means you lose.|$|R
