[...] Developed by General Telephone and Electronics (GTE) and called KarTrak ACI (Automatic Car Identification), this scheme involved placing colored stripes in various combinations on steel plates which were affixed to the sides of railroad rolling stock. [...] Two plates were used per car, one on each side, with the arrangement of the colored stripes encoding information such as ownership, type of equipment, and identification number. [...] The plates were read by a <b>trackside</b> <b>scanner,</b> located for instance, at the entrance to a classification yard, while the car was moving past. [...] The project was abandoned after about ten years because the system proved unreliable after long-term use.|$|E

Through the efforts of the Association of American Railroads (AAR), a number of companies developed Automatic equipment identification (AEI) systems. The AAR selected four systems for extensive field tests. General Electric developed an RFID system, ABEX a microwave system, Wabco a black and white barcode system, and General Telephone and Electronics (GTE) a color barcode system called KarTrak. All those systems, except the RFID system, had labels that were mounted on each side of the rail car and a <b>trackside</b> <b>scanner.</b>|$|E
