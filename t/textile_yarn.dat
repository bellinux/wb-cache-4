5000|$|Cashmere {{wool fiber}} for {{clothing}} and other textile articles is {{obtained from the}} neck region of Cashmere and other goats. Historically, fine-haired Cashmere goats have been called Capra hircus laniger, {{as if they were}} a subspecies of the domestic goat Capra hircus. However, they are now more commonly considered part of the domestic goat subspecies Capra aegagrus hircus. Cashmere goats produce a double fleece that consists of a fine, soft undercoat or underdown of hair mingled with a straighter and much coarser outer coating of hair called guard hair. For the fine underdown to be sold and processed further, it must be de-haired. De-hairing is a mechanical process that separates the coarse hairs from the fine hair. After de-hairing, the resulting [...] "cashmere" [...] is ready to be dyed and converted into <b>textile</b> <b>yarn,</b> fabrics and garments.|$|E
30|$|In general, metal filament/wires have rigid {{characteristics}} {{when compared}} to <b>textile</b> <b>yarns</b> and filaments. They are resilient and have less efficiency {{to return to their}} normal shapes after experiencing mechanical deformations. Moreover, when placed inside the yarn as core component (in case of core-sheath or plied yarns), the mechanical/tensile properties of these metallic filaments drape over the properties of the textile component (Vasile et al. 2011). Since, the core component’s mechanical/tensile properties in any hybrid yarn structure dominates the yarn’s mechanical/tensile properties (Pl et al. 2015), therefore incorporating the metallic filaments as core deteriorate the mechanical/tensile properties of <b>textile</b> <b>yarns</b> and ultimately the fabrics’.|$|R

40|$|The {{scope of}} the {{presented}} bachelor’s thesis was {{the establishment of a}} probabilistic model for material strength of textile reinforcement used for textile reinforced concrete. This reinforcement is composed of AR-glass multi-filament yarns. The goal of this thesis was to determine the potential weak spot of the <b>textile</b> <b>yarn</b> and evaluate its strength in overall. The weak spot could have been a lateral cross-connection, which narrowed the <b>textile</b> <b>yarn</b> at several locations. Another thing of interest was the observation of statistical size effect with the increasing length of <b>textile</b> <b>yarn.</b> In order to properly fit the numerical model to real behavior of multi-filament yarns, five series of experimental tensile testing has been executed in laboratory. Each series consisted of 8 - 10 specimens and had a different yarn length. Maximum tensile force and maximum deformation have been measured to obtain L-D diagrams for each specimen. Measured data were statistically analyzed and gave the information necessary for the identification of probabilistic model parameters. This parameter estimation has been carried out with the help of numerical and optimization methods included in Python programming algorithms. The problem statement resulted in a combination of model parameters describing the <b>textile</b> <b>yarn</b> behavior. The statistical size effect was observed corresponding to the Weibull theory. The performed study showed that the failure of the <b>textile</b> <b>yarn</b> depends on material strength of its filaments. There are no load concentrators at the location of lateral cross-connections affecting the yarn failure...|$|E
