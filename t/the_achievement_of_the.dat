25|$|Sanitation. National Household Budget Surveys ask {{respondents}} {{about the}} type of sanitary facility they have. In 2007 93% of Tanzanians responded that they had some form of latrine, but only 3% had a flush toilet. International statistics that monitor <b>the</b> <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Millennium Development Goal for sanitation are based on these numbers, but only after making some important adjustments {{in an effort to}} achieve comparability across countries. The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) defines improved sanitation as excreta disposal systems that are private and that separate human excreta from human contact. Shared latrines or open pit latrines are excluded from this definition. The JMP estimates that only about half the latrines in Tanzania can be considered improved sanitation systems. Based on that definition, access to improved sanitation is much lower than the population with access to any type of latrine. According to the JMP definition, access to improved sanitation was only 10% in 2010, up from 8% in 1990, with an increase in urban areas and a slight decrease in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese Army, which {{understood}} the logistical problems {{of attempting to}} conquer such a vast country as China far better than Konoe ever did, had objected to the Konoe programme for precisely that reason; it committed Japan to winning a total victory over China that Japan {{did not have the}} power to achieve {{while at the same time}} making anything less than <b>the</b> <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Konoe programme seem like a defeat for Japan. In July 1938, Japan launched an offensive intended to capture Wuhan, and finally win the war. The summer offensive of 1938 succeeded in taking Wuhan, but the Japanese failed to destroy the core of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army, which retreated further up the Yangtze. After the Wuhan offensive, the Imperial Army informed Tokyo that the troops in the central Yangtze valley were at the end of a long, tenuous and very overstretched supply line, and no further advances up the Yangtze were at present possible. Unable to win the final victory on the battlefield, the Japanese turned to bombing as an alternative, launching an all-out bombing campaign intended to raze the temporary capital of Chongqing to the ground.|$|E
25|$|The Joint Water and Sanitation Sector Programme Support, {{which follows}} a Sector-Wide Approach, is aligned with Uganda's 2004 Poverty Eradication Action Plan. Altogether, US$150million {{were to be}} spent under the program, which started in 2008 and was {{expected}} to run for five years. The major development partner involved in the program was the Danish International Development Agency, which alone provided US$66million. The other partners were the African Development Bank (US$27million), the Austrian Development Agency (US$19million), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (US$14million), the UK's Department for International Development (US$10million), the EU (US$9million), the German Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit, and the GermanKfW (US$6million). The program aimed to support <b>the</b> <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sector targets. It intended to serve about 1,410,000 people in rural areas, 373,000 people in rural growth centers (RGCs) (communities with a population between 2,000 and 5,000 people), and 155,000 in small towns directly with water and to give them access to basic sanitation and hygiene facilities. Besides the extension of {{water supply and sanitation}} in rural areas, RGCs, and small towns, the program included the following components: water resources management, sector program support for capacity building, and sector reforms and water for production.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, George H. Heilmeier, {{then working}} at the RCA {{laboratories}} on the effect discovered by Williams achieved the switching of colors by field-induced realignment of dichroic dyes in a homeotropically oriented liquid crystal. Practical problems with this new electro-optical effect made Heilmeier {{continue to work on}} scattering effects in liquid crystals and finally <b>the</b> <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first operational liquid-crystal display based on what he called the dynamic scattering mode (DSM). Application of a voltage to a DSM display switches the initially clear transparent liquid crystal layer into a milky turbid state. DSM displays could be operated in transmissive and in reflective mode but they required a considerable current to flow for their operation. George H. Heilmeier was inducted in the National Inventors Hall of Fame and credited with the invention of LCDs. Heilmeier's work is an IEEE Milestone. In the late 1960s, pioneering work on liquid crystals was undertaken by the UK's Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern, England. The team at RRE supported ongoing work by George William Gray and his team at the University of Hull who ultimately discovered the cyanobiphenyl liquid crystals, which had correct stability and temperature properties for application in LCDs.|$|E
