Furthermore, for people on low incomes, the CMU offers complementary health coverage of 100%, which is added to standard Social Security payments; this avoids the necessity for additional private (<b>top-up)</b> <b>insurance.</b>|$|E
40|$|Summary Aim: The general aim of {{this study}} was to learn more about {{antibiotic}} consumption in France. A descriptive study on the characteristics of prescribers, patients and medicines prescribed was conducted to begin with, followed by a study of the profiles of the GPs who prescribe the most antibiotics. Methods: The study was carried out on all antibiotic prescriptions reimbursed to beneficiaries of the General Health Insurance Scheme, excluding local <b>top-up</b> <b>insurance</b> schemes, between 1 July 2008 and 30 April 2010. A classification in ascending ranking order established different categories of GPs with similar characteristics. Results: 2 836 361 antibiotic prescriptions were given to 987 994 patients. The average number of defined daily doses (DDD) prescribed was higher for 15 to 24 yearold women. Alsacian GPs prescribe 17. 89 (68. 4 %) of the 26. 14 DDD/ 1 000 inhabitants issued. Penicillin accounts for 12. 76 DDD and macrolides 4. 15. The overall prescription trends between the beginning and the end of the period studied are stable. A category of GPs set up longer than the average with more patients on their books prescribes fewer penicillins and more macrolides. On the other hand, a second category of doctors having set up more recently and with fewer patients registered prescribes more penicillins. Conclusion: Antibiotic consumption is on the rise again since 2007. Prescriptions of antibiotic groups usually used as a second resort are over-represented. These tend to be given by doctors set up longer than the average and who should logically be the priority targets for guidance initiatives. Prat Organ Soins. 2012; 43 (2) : 81 - 9...|$|E
