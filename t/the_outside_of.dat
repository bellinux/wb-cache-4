5|$|Having {{failed to}} cut the French line at his first attempt, Howe reissued the order at 12:30. Once more Caesar was to lead the way, with the {{intention}} of splitting the enemy fleet in half. Captain Molloy then refused to carry out the order, signalling without cause that Caesar was unable to tack and then turning and sailing eastwards down <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the British fleet, rather than towards the enemy. This unexpected move threw the following ships into a state of confusion; Queen, coming behind Caesar, attempted to obey Howe's signal alone but was badly damaged by shot, and her captain John Hutt mortally wounded. Unable to effectively manoeuvre, Queen passed down <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the French line, firing as she went.|$|E
5|$|Initially the old {{tower was}} {{converted}} into a stronger keep which was able to support artillery guns on its roof, a gatehouse was built alongside it, four stirrup towers – so-called because of their shape – a curtain wall was constructed around <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the castle, and bastions erected around the wall. Towards {{the end of this}} phase of work the castle was altered in a frantic burst of work, possibly driven on by pressure from the King himself. The height of the curtain wall was increased, the gatehouse extended into an entrance bastion, a new network of underground passages installed, and foreworks added around <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the bastions. By the end of 1540 the castle was garrisoned with 17 men and equipped with artillery, with Chute appointed as its captain.|$|E

They have been left as originally constructed and there are not any plans to improve upon them, because people are reluctant to tamper with the original shrine complex.|$|E

The inside of the bailey still shows the marks of former strip farming, which can be seen in winter.|$|E
5|$|During the night, another storm broke (this time {{probably}} a thunder-storm, possibly with a south easterly wind), preventing the Allies from setting off southwards {{to counter the}} Persian detachment sent around <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> Euboea. However, the storm also hit the Persian detachment of ships, driving them off course and onto the rocky coast of 'the Hollows' of Euboea. This part of the Persian fleet was thus also shipwrecked, losing most of the ships.|$|E

5|$|In {{accordance}} with their expected mission, the boats could transport up to six naval commandos armed with 612 M-66 or M-71 limpet mines.

Four R-1 swimmer delivery vehicles could be carried {{in place of the}} AIM-70/71 mines.

They then insert one or more eggs into the host or deposit them upon <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the host. The host remains alive until the parasitoid larvae pupate or emerge as adults.|$|E
