25|$|The 15th century saw the {{beginning}} of the cultural movement of the Renaissance. The rediscovery of Greek scientific texts, both ancient and medieval, was accelerated as the Byzantine Empire fell to the Ottoman Turks and many Byzantine scholars sought refuge in the West, particularly Italy. Also, the invention of printing was to have great effect on European society: the facilitated dissemination of <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> <b>word</b> democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of new ideas.|$|E
25|$|A second {{outgrowth}} of this popularization of knowledge was {{the decline of}} Latin as the language of most published works, {{to be replaced by}} the vernacular language of each area, increasing the variety of published works. <b>The</b> <b>printed</b> <b>word</b> also helped to unify and standardize the spelling and syntax of these vernaculars, in effect 'decreasing' their variability. This rise in importance of national languages as opposed to pan-European Latin is cited as one of the causes of the rise of nationalism in Europe.|$|E
25|$|According to this method, printed {{language}} and text {{must be kept}} away from second language learners {{for as long as}} possible, just as a first language learner does not use printed words until he has good grasp of speech. Learning of writing and spelling should be delayed until after <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> <b>word</b> has been introduced, and grammar and translation should also be avoided because this would involve the application of the learner's first language. All above items must be avoided because they hinder the acquisition of a good oral proficiency.|$|E

25|$|Thomson was an {{accomplished}} photographer in many areas, including landscapes, portraiture, street photography, and architectural photography, and his legacy {{is one of}} outstanding quality and breadth of coverage. His photography from the Far East enlightened the Victorian audience of Britain about the land, people, and cultures of China and South-East Asia.

25|$|Combined {{with this}} influx of {{classical}} ideas was {{the invention of}} printing, which facilitated dissemination of <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> <b>word</b> and democratized learning. These two things would later lead to the Protestant Reformation. Toward {{the end of the}} period, the Age of Discovery began. The expansion of the Ottoman Empire cut off trading possibilities with the east. Europeans were forced to seek new trading routes, leading to the Spanish expedition under Columbus to the Americas in 1492, and Vasco da Gama’s voyage to Africa and India in 1498. Their discoveries strengthened the economy and power of European nations.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} {{the late}} Middle Ages period, the Renaissance spread {{unevenly}} over continental Europe from the southern European region. The intellectual transformation of the Renaissance is viewed as a bridge between the Middle Ages and the Modern era. Europeans would later begin an era of world discovery. Combined with the influx of classical ideas was the invention of printing which facilitated dissemination of <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> <b>word</b> and democratized learning. These two things would lead to the Protestant Reformation. Europeans also discovered new trading routes, {{as was the case with}} Columbus’ travel to the Americas in 1492, and Vasco da Gama’s circumnavigation of Africa and India in 1498. Their discoveries strengthened the economy and power of European nations.|$|E
25|$|An {{emphasis}} on oral transmission {{as more important}} than <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> <b>word</b> derives from the earliest period of Indian Buddhism, when it allowed teachings to be kept from those who should not hear them. Hearing a teaching (transmission) readies the hearer for realization based on it. The person from whom one hears the teaching should have heard it as one link in a succession of listeners {{going back to the}} original speaker: the Buddha {{in the case of a}} sutra or the author in the case of a book. Then the hearing constitutes an authentic lineage of transmission. Authenticity of the oral lineage is a prerequisite for realization, hence the importance of lineages.|$|E
25|$|The {{printing}} of images in newspapers remained an isolated occurrence in this period. Photos {{were used to}} enhance the text rather than {{to act as a}} medium of information in its own right. This began to change with the work of one of the pioneers of photojournalism, John Thomson, in the late 1870s. In collaboration with the radical journalist Adolphe Smith, he began publishing a monthly magazine, Street Life in London, from 1876 to 1877. The project documented in photographs and text, the lives of the street people of London and established social documentary photography as a form of photojournalism. Instead of the images acting as a supplement to the text, he pioneered the use of printed photographs as the predominant medium for the imparting of information, successfully combining photography with <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1348, the Black Death {{and other}} {{disasters}} sealed a sudden {{end to the}} previous period of massive philosophic and scientific development. Yet, the rediscovery of ancient texts was improved after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, when many Byzantine scholars had to seek refuge in the West. Meanwhile, the introduction of printing was to have great effect on European society. The facilitated dissemination of <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> <b>word</b> democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of new ideas. New ideas also helped to influence the development of European science at this point: not least the introduction of Algebra. These developments {{paved the way for}} the Scientific Revolution, which may also be understood as a resumption of the process of scientific inquiry, halted at the start of the Black Death.|$|E
25|$|At the time, books {{had been}} {{regarded}} with something approaching veneration, {{but by the}} mid-eighteenth century this {{was no longer the}} case. The rise of literacy among the general public, combined with the technical advances in the mechanics of printing and bookbinding, meant that for the first time, books, texts, maps, pamphlets and newspapers were widely available to the general public at a reasonable cost. Such an explosion of <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> <b>word</b> demanded a set pattern of grammar, definition, and spelling for those words. This could be achieved by means of an authoritative dictionary of the English language. In 1746, a consortium of London's most successful printers, including Robert Dodsley and Thomas Longman – none could afford to undertake it alone – set out to satisfy and capitalise on this need by the ever-increasing reading and writing public.|$|E
25|$|As {{classroom}} technologies {{become more}} prolific, so do multimodal assignments. Students {{in the 21st century}} have more options for communicating digitally, be it texting, blogging, or through social media. This rise in computer-controlled communication has required classes to become multimodal {{in order to}} teach students the skills required in the 21st-century work environment. However, in the classroom setting, multimodality is more than just combining multiple technologies, but rather creating meaning through the integration of multiple modes. Students are learning through a combination of these modes, including sound, gestures, speech, images and text. For example, in digital components of lessons, there are often pictures, videos, and sound bites as well as the text to help students grasp {{a better understanding of the}} subject. Multimodality also requires that teachers move beyond teaching with just text, as <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> <b>word</b> is only one of many modes students must learn and use.|$|E

25|$|Gardnerian Wicca {{came to the}} United States {{through an}} Englishman who had {{recently}} emigrated to the USA, named Raymond Buckland, and his wife, Rosemary. Raymond, working for British Airways, regularly returned to England, {{and he began to}} correspond with Gardner. In 1963, both Bucklands were initiated into the Gardnerian craft by Monique Wilson in a ceremony in Britain. The couple returned to America where they founded the Long Island coven in New York state, basing their practice upon the Gardnerian Book of Shadows. The coven was later taken over by a couple known only as Theos and Phoenix, who enlarged the Book of Shadows, adding further degrees of initiation which were required before members could found their own covens. Interest outstripped the ability of the mostly British-based covens to train and propagate members; the beliefs of the religion spread faster by <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> <b>word</b> or word of mouth than the initiatory system was prepared to handle.|$|E
25|$|Fifth, at a {{time when}} the country was {{emerging}} from the medieval period and was faced with the spread of Catholic and Protestant ideas, the diocese promoted <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> <b>word</b> as a means of enshrining Orthodox identity and unity of belief. Between 1508 and 1512, during the reigns of Radu IV, Mihnea cel Rău and Neagoe Basarab, three books appeared in Romanian at Bistrița Monastery: a service book, a Psalter and a Gospel book. Between 1636 and 1642, six religious books appeared at Govora Monastery, among them a rule book. There, a religious and cultural school operated, among its students being typographers. This was promoted by Metropolitan Teofil, a former bishop of Râmnic, supported by Prince Matei Basarab and his logothete Udriște Năsturel. In 1705, after becoming bishop, Anthim brought with him a printing press from Snagov Monastery, establishing a printing center in Râmnic and publishing nine or ten religious books by 1707. Their importance lies in the fact that with their completion, most Orthodox sacred texts had now appeared in Romanian, advancing the process of making the liturgical language a vernacular one and legitimizing Romanian as a sacred language, a process begun by Coresi, Dosoftei and Mitrofan of Buzău and continued through further translations by his successor Bishop Damaschin. As part of their political and cultural strategy, Constantin Brâncoveanu and Metropolitan Teodosie disseminated Anthim's texts to Romanians in Transylvania, subject to official attempts to convert them to Western Christianity.|$|E
