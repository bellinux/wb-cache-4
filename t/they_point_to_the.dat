25|$|It {{should be}} noted that Sunnis dismiss the Shia version of the Quranic {{compilation}} as nothing more than Twelver Shia fabrications. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that Zaydi Shias who form the oldest living Shia sect believe in the above events described in Sahih Bukhari.|$|E
25|$|Amenhotep II did not openly {{record the}} names of his queens; some Egyptologists theorise that he felt that women had become too {{powerful}} under titles such as God's Wife of Amun. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that he participated in his father's removal of Hatshepsut's name from her monuments {{and the destruction of}} her image.|$|E
25|$|According to Shaheen Sardar Ali and Javaid Rehman, both {{professors of}} law, the Islamic {{military}} jurisprudence {{are in line}} with rules of modern international law. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dual commitment of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member states (representing most of the Muslim world) to Islamic law and the United Nations Charter, as evidence of compatibility of both legal systems.|$|E

25|$|Some NESARA detractors {{claim that}} NESARA is a cult {{designed}} primarily {{to provide an}} income to Goodwin and others. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that Goodwin, Lee, and Nidle frequently asked their readers to donate money. Goodwin, who also asked readers to donate their frequent flyer miles, claimed that she needed and had used the funds to travel to various locations {{around the world to}} secretly meet with high-level government officials about getting NESARA announced.|$|E
25|$|Pierrebourg and Juneau-Katsuya {{also raised}} {{concerns}} over ties between Confucius Institute administrators and large state-run Chinese companies. For instance, <b>they</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Confucius Institute at the University of Texas at Dallas, {{where one of}} the top officials is also vice-president of Huawei, a Chinese telecom company the U.S. government regards as a national security threat, and which has been accused of industrial espionage, though an extensive security review found no clear evidence of spying.|$|E
25|$|Feminist {{critics have}} focused on the gender system of Early Modern England. For example, <b>they</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> common {{classification}} of women as maid, wife or widow, with only whores outside this trilogy. Using this analysis, the problem of Hamlet becomes the central character's identification of his mother as a whore due to her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet, in consequence of which he loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia {{as if she were a}} whore also.|$|E

25|$|Theories {{regarding}} such parallels {{were popular}} in the 19th century. Some modern scholars such as Martin Hengel, Barry Powell, Robert M. Price, and Peter Wick argue that Dionysian religion and Christianity have parallels. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> symbolism of wine and the importance it held in the mythology surrounding both Dionysus and Jesus Christ. Wick, however, argues {{that the use of}} wine symbolism in the Gospel of John, including the story of the Marriage at Cana, at which Jesus turns water into wine, is intended to show Jesus as superior to Dionysus.|$|E
25|$|Marlovians {{suggest it}} is {{significant}} that every person involved in the incident seems to have been associated {{in one way or another}} either with his friend and patron Thomas Walsingham (Frizer and Skeres) or with his employers the Cecils (Poley, Bull and Danby). <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lengthy period (10 hours) in which the four men remained together at Eleanor Bull's house that day, and suggest this seems unnecessary if the intent had been simply to dispose of Marlowe. The most likely reason for the get-together, they say, would have been to save him in some way from the peril facing him. They claim that the faking of his death fits more of the facts as known than any other scenario. That Poley, Frizer and Skeres all made a living from being able to lie convincingly may have been relevant too.|$|E
25|$|However, some {{observers}} claim the merger {{has not had}} positive results. Critics argue that local FEA unions are less effective in collective bargaining, local and state annual dues are too high, young teachers are reluctant to join their local affiliates, and neither the state association nor local unions have done much to protect under-performing teachers from being fired. These critics say the association is increasingly frozen out of politics {{in a state where}} Republicans control both the executive and legislative branches of government, and has made little headway in convincing the public that the candidates it backs are worth electing or the policies it supports are worth enacting. FEA supporters counter that the federation has proven effective despite these odds, and remains a force in state politics. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> federation's king-making role in the state's 2002 Democratic gubernatorial primary, where the union's candidate (Bill McBride) defeated a better-known and funded candidate (Janet Reno) and ran a strong campaign against a popular, wealthy incumbent (Gov. Jeb Bush).|$|E
5000|$|Commentators {{generally}} {{welcomed the}} new body {{as likely to}} make a positive contribution in <b>the</b> efforts <b>to</b> minimise climate change. At <b>the</b> same time, <b>they</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> slow pace of government action in promoting energy conservation and implementing existing low-carbon technologies, [...] compared to progress {{in a number of}} other European countries.|$|R
60|$|Both the impostors {{begged him}} to be so kind as to step closer, {{and asked him if}} it were not a {{beautiful}} texture and lovely colours. <b>They</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> empty loom, and the poor old minister went forward rubbing his eyes; but he could see nothing, for there was nothing there.|$|R
25|$|Steel {{companies}} also turned toward strikebreaking and rumor-mongering <b>to</b> demoralize <b>the</b> picketers. They brought in between 30,000 and 40,000 African-American and Mexican American workers <b>to</b> work in <b>the</b> mills. Company spies also spread {{rumors that the}} strike had collapsed elsewhere, and <b>they</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> operating steel mills as proof that the strike had been defeated.|$|R
500|$|Jeff Garrett and Ron Guth, {{in their}} work on American gold coins, call {{the details of the}} coin [...] "a trifle fantastic". [...] <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unlikeliness of any female wearing a headdress only donned by a male warrior, and {{describe}} the word [...] "LIBERTY" [...] on the headdress as [...] "placed incongruously".|$|E
500|$|Apart from anti-communist campaigning, {{economics}} {{was another}} factor in moving south. The US gave handouts of US$89 ($ as of [...] ) for each refugee who moved; {{the per capita}} income in Vietnam {{at the time was}} only $85 per year ($ per year as of [...] ). Others have pointed to natural geographic factors unrelated to and uncontrollable by political regimes. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that the land in the south was seen as being more productive, and memories of the Great Vietnamese Famine of 1945, which killed millions in the north, as reasons independent of politics that motivated migrants. In the mid-1950s, northern Vietnam again suffered food shortages, and some migrants have cited food security as motive for relocation. Adding to this was a general perception that Saigon was a more modern city with more economic vibrancy. Earlier in the 20th century, there had also been instances of campaigns by Catholics to encourage southerly migration to exploit underdeveloped land in the south, so it was not a new concept for them.|$|E
500|$|Under the {{provisions}} of the Civil Aviation Act aircraft in flight are specifically exempted from trespass and nuisance controls, which denies any form of redress to those living near airports who are disturbed by noise. Government sanctioned measurements of noise near airports take an average sound level, measured in decibels (dB), over a 16‑hour day, and are expressed as an LAeq figure. Officially, 57dB LAeq is the threshold at which noise levels become disturbing, 63dB LAeq represents moderate disturbance, whilst 69dB LAeq represents high disturbance. Technological improvements in aircraft design means that aircraft are becoming quieter. Taking Heathrow as an example, between 1990 and 2004 the area around the airport affected by noise levels of 57 db LAeq and above fell by 60 per cent, whilst the number of people similarly affected fell by 51 per cent. Campaign groups dispute the methodology used to measure noise, asserting that it is flawed in a number of ways. Amongst other issues <b>they</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> World Health Organisation view that annoyance begins at 50 db LAeq whilst serious annoyance begins at 55dB LAeq, and they assert that the LAeq measurement does not give sufficient weight to the increasing incidence of noise events. Their conclusion is that noise levels, and the number of people affected, have increased rather than decreased. This is borne out by the latest survey of attitudes to noise published in November 2007 which reports that, compared with over 20years ago, more people today are annoyed by the same level of noise as measured by LAeq. Whilst this may be attributable to changing attitudes, the report concludes that the contribution of aircraft numbers to annoyance has increased, and that an alternative method of estimating levels of annoyance that takes this into account would appear to be more relevant than the LAeq measurement. The report has attracted criticism in peer reviews, and one such review, characterising the survey as inconclusive, counsels [...] "...against using the detailed ...|$|E

30|$|Experimenters used a grid {{representing}} the larger-scale search space to record accuracy. When participants found a target, <b>they</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> target and informed the experimenter, who then marked off the corresponding target on the grid.

2500|$|The Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum has {{advanced}} {{another reason for}} pre-emptively dispersing citizens living in opposition party strongholds. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that the government faces an unprecedented economic crisis characterised by fuel and food shortages, rampant hyperinflation, and virtually no foreign currency.

2500|$|Historic Adventism is an {{informal}} designation for conservative {{individuals and organizations}} affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church who seek to preserve certain traditional beliefs and practices of the church. They feel that the church leadership has shifted or departed from key doctrinal [...] "pillars" [...] ever {{since the middle of}} the 20th century. Specifically, <b>they</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> publication in 1957 of a book entitled Seventh-day Adventists Answer Questions on Doctrine; which they feel undermines historic Adventist theology in favor of theology more compatible with evangelicalism.|$|E
5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of parity was politically controversial, {{particularly in the}} 1930s and 1940s. Proponents believed the period from 1909 to 1914 had represented a desirable [...] "dynamic" [...] equilibrium between the industrial and manufacturing sectors of <b>the</b> economy. <b>They</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> era's low unemployment and industrial stability. The departure from this ideal was blamed on World War I's massive distortions.|$|R

2500|$|Docking of puppies {{younger than}} 10 to 14 days old is {{routinely}} {{carried out by}} both breeders and veterinarians without anesthesia. Opponents of these procedures state that most tail dockings are done for aesthetic reasons rather than health concerns and are unnecessarily painful for the dog. They point out that even non-working show or pet dogs are routinely docked. As a result, tail defects that docking proponents claim makes docking necessary {{in the first place}} are perpetuated in the breeds. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> many breeds of working dogs with long tails that are not traditionally docked, including English Pointers, Setters, Herding dogs, and Foxhounds.|$|E
2500|$|Loyola Law School Professors Karl Manheim and Allan Ides {{write that}} [...] "the {{separation}} among the branches {{is not and}} never {{was intended to be}} airtight," [...] and <b>they</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> President's veto power {{as an example of the}} executive exercising legislative power. They also cite other examples of quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial power being exercised by the executive branch, as necessary elements of the administrative state, but they contend that ultimately all administrative power belongs to Congress rather than the President, and the only true [...] "executive" [...] powers are those explicitly described in the Constitution. [...] In this understanding, Manheim and Ides follow in the footsteps of Lessig and Sunstein.|$|E
