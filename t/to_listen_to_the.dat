5|$|A {{ceremony}} is held each October 13 at the outfield wall in Oakland {{to listen to}} a taped broadcast of the final game of the 1960 World Series. The tradition was started by Squirrel Hill resident Saul Finkelstein, who at 1:05 pm on October 13, 1985, sat alone {{at the base of the}} flagpole and listened to the NBC radio broadcast of Chuck Thompson and Jack Quinlan. Finkelstein continued the tradition for eight more years, until word spread and other people began attending in 1993. On October 13, 2000—the game's 40th anniversary—over 600people attended <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> broadcast, including Mazeroski himself. For the 50th anniversary, on October 13, 2010, a plaque honoring Mazeroski was dedicated and more than 1,000 attended the broadcast, including Mazeroski and several other former Pirates.|$|E

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi, and uses a shorten version of Peters' remix. The visual portrays Hamasaki in a dark laboratory, being surrounded by keyboards, electronic devices and a black bird. Throughout the music video, several people start to wear headphones and follow Hamasaki, with them eventually starting <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> song and observing TV monitors of the singer. Each person, including Hamasaki, wears black eye shadow on one eye, and a code on their hand. Over the clip, the singer is seen singing to the recording in the laboratory, with interspersed scenes portraying her wearing the outfit used for the single's artwork. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki, includingA Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), and the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014).|$|E
5|$|In 1943, {{after school}} and having {{enrolled}} at university, Waldron was called up by the army, and was based at West Point, in New York. This allowed him <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> greats of jazz in clubs on 52nd Street {{and elsewhere in the}} city. After two years in the army, he returned as a student to Queens College in New York, where he studied under composer Karol Rathaus and made the final decision to switch from saxophone to piano. This decision was influenced in part by hearing Charlie Parker's virtuoso speed on saxophone, and by not having the extroverted personality Waldron thought necessary for that instrument. Not yet a professional musician, he received money through the G.I. Bill and continued to live with his parents. After obtaining a B.A. in music in 1949, Waldron worked for a short time in rhythm and blues bands, including with Big Nick Nicholas.|$|E
5|$|Ketèlbey {{wrote an}} intermezzo—A Birthday Greeting—in 1932, {{on the sixth}} {{birthday}} of Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II). His connection to royalty continued in 1934, when his march A State Procession was played to accompany the arrival of King George V at a Royal Command Performance; the king requested that the march should be played again during the interval, and he and the queen stayed in the royal box <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> piece. In the following year Ketèlbey wrote the march With Honour Crowned for the King's silver jubilee; the work was played for the royal family at Windsor Castle before Ketèlbey conducted its first public performance at Kingsway Hall. The work was played at that year's Trooping the Colour and at the Jubilee Thanksgiving Service at St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Ramones is {{the debut}} studio album by American punk rock band the Ramones, {{released}} on April 23, 1976 by Sire Records. After Hit Parader editor Lisa Robinson saw the band at a gig in New York City, {{she wrote about}} them in an article and contacted Danny Fields, insisting that he be their manager. Fields agreed and convinced Craig Leon to produce Ramones, and the band recorded a demo for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president Seymour Stein <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 to record the album. They used similar sound-output techniques {{to those of the}} Beatles and used advanced production methods by Leon.|$|E
5|$|Sperm {{whales are}} not the easiest of whales to watch, due to their long dive times and ability to travel long {{distances}} underwater. However, due to the distinctive look and large size of the whale, watching is increasingly popular. Sperm whale watchers often use hydrophones <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clicks of the whales and locate them before they surface. Popular locations for sperm whale watching include the town of Kaikoura on New Zealand's South Island, Andenes and Tromsø in Arctic Norway; {{as well as the}} Azores, where the continental shelf is so narrow that whales can be observed from the shore, and Dominica where a long-term scientific research program, The Dominica Sperm Whale Project, has been in operation since 2005.|$|E
5|$|The School of International and Public Affairs extends {{invitations to}} {{heads of state}} and heads of {{government}} who come to New York City {{for the opening of}} the fall session of the United Nations General Assembly. In 2007, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was one of those invited to speak on campus. Ahmadinejad accepted his invitation and spoke on September 24, 2007, as part of Columbia University's World Leaders Forum. The invitation proved to be highly controversial. Hundreds of demonstrators swarmed the campus on September 24 and the speech itself was televised worldwide. University President Lee C. Bollinger tried to allay the controversy by letting Ahmadenijad speak, but with a negative introduction (given personally by Bollinger). This did not mollify those who were displeased {{with the fact that the}} Iranian leader had been invited onto the campus. Columbia students, though, turned out en masse <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> speech on the South Lawn. An estimated 2,500 undergraduates and graduates came out for the historic occasion.|$|E
