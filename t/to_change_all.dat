25|$|Napoleon Bonaparte sold French Louisiana to the United States in 1803, {{including}} all of Arkansas, in a transaction {{known today as}} the Louisiana Purchase. French soldiers remained as a garrison at Arkansas Post. Following the purchase, the balanced give-and-take relationship between settlers and Native Americans began <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>all</b> along the frontier, including in Arkansas. Following a controversy over allowing slavery in the territory, the Territory of Arkansas was organized on July 4, 1819. Gradual emancipation in Arkansas was struck down by one vote, the Speaker of the House Henry Clay, allowing Arkansas to organize as a slave territory.|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{the filmmakers}} had {{initially}} intended for [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] {{to be performed}} by Lumiere to Belle's disoriented father Maurice when the character first discovers the Beast's castle. According to co-director Gary Trousdale, [...] "The song had already been recorded and the sequence partially animated when we decided {{that it would be}} more meaningful if it was directed towards Belle" [...] because [...] "she is one of the two main characters and the story revolves around her coming to the castle." [...] Consequently, the song had to be re-written and the entire scene re-animated. Trousdale explained, [...] "We had to bring Jerry Orbach and all the other vocal talents back into the studio <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>all</b> references to gender that appeared in the original recording." ...|$|E

500|$|Orm's chief {{innovation}} was {{to employ}} doubled consonants {{to show that}} the preceding vowel is short and single consonants when the vowel is long (Treharne 2000, p.273). For syllables that ended in vowels, he used accent marks to indicate length. In addition to this, he used two distinct letter forms for g, using the old yogh for [...] and , and the new g for [...] (Jack, George, in Matthew and Harrison 2004, pp.936–37). His devotion to precise spelling was meticulous; for example, having originally used eo and e inconsistently for words such as [...] "beon" [...] and [...] "kneow," [...] which had been spelled with eo in Old English, at line 13,000 he changed his mind and went back <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>all</b> eo spellings, replacing them solely with e alone (ben and knew), to reflect the pronunciation (Matthew 2004, p.936; Jack, George, in Matthew and Harrison 2004, pp.936–37).|$|E
500|$|On March 11, 2003, Republican U.S. Representatives Bob Ney and Walter B. Jones {{directed}} the three House cafeterias <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>all</b> references to French fries and French toast on menus, {{and replace them}} with Freedom fries and Freedom toast, respectively. Jones chose to follow Cubbie's example by circulating a letter to his colleagues advocating their renaming because, he said, [...] "the French were 'sitting on the sidelines. As Ney was Chairman of the United States House Committee on House Administration, the action did not require any vote, as the committee has authority over House cafeterias. According to a statement released by Ney, the renaming was intended to express displeasure with France's [...] "continued refusal to stand with their U.S. allies". The statement further read: [...] "This action today is a small but symbolic effort to show the strong displeasure many on Capitol Hill have with our so-called ally, France." [...] When asked about his view on the change, Jones said it was a [...] "lighthearted gesture".|$|E
500|$|Act II {{begins with}} Midas enamored {{with his new}} power of turning things to gold. However, his courtiers {{complain}} of being forced to wear heavy golden clothing. Midas rebukes them, saying [...] "I am a God!". But Midas himself begins to experience the problems of turning everything he touches to gold: he cannot eat, for example. He starts to regret his wish, saying [...] "Oh! fool! to wish <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>all</b> things to gold! / Blind Ideot that I was!". Midas prays to Bacchus to take away his power, begging [...] "Make me a hind, clothe me in ragged skins— / And let my food be bread, unsavoury roots, / But take from me the frightful curse of gold". Midas has his courtiers sacrifice to the gods {{to see if he}} can be relieved of his curse; Bacchus relents and tells him to bathe in the river. The courtiers find it strange that he does not remove his crown while he swims; one of them resolves to peek under his crown while he is sleeping. Returning from his swim, Midas celebrates nature, saying gold [...] "is a sordid, base and dirty thing;— / Look at the grass, the sky, the trees, the flowers, / These are Joves treasures & they are not gold".|$|E

2500|$|In 1917, {{the year}} the United States {{declared}} war on Germany, half of the city's residents could speak German, and many spoke only German. The community had organized German schools and frequently held religious services in German at many churches. In 1918, the government required German men who had not become naturalized citizens to register as alien enemies. The New York Times reported, [...] "When one spoke of going 'over the Rhine,' as the canal was called, he meant that he was disappearing into a realm where all English was left behind." [...] The city passed an ordinance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>all</b> German street names in the city. In Over-the-Rhine, Bremen Street was changed to Republic and Hanover became Yukon Street. As happened in some {{other areas of the}} country with numerous ethnic Germans, the state closed German-language schools, dismissed teachers of German, and banned German-language classes from all public schools. The Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County withdrew all German books from its shelves. Many German Americans anglicized their names out of fear of persecution. Some businesses with German names changed them to survive the anti-war sentiment. Cincinnati's German heritage continued to be suppressed until after World War II, a war in which Germany again was opposed by the United States.|$|E

2500|$|By 1996, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, then Lucienne Robillard, stated on the {{suggested}} alterations to the oath: [...] "This {{is a difficult}} decision to make, because I realise that when you speak about changing the oath, people think you want <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>all</b> the monarchy system. We don't want a discussion like that in Canada right now." [...] According to an Angus Reid Strategies survey for Citizenship and Immigration Canada, conducted in January 1996, 51% of respondents felt that a new oath of allegiance should remove any reference to the Queen, and 38% felt that allegiance should be pledged to both Canada and its sovereign. Only 5% favoured swearing allegiance only to the monarch; though, at the same time, only 5% of Canadians were aware the Queen was their head of state. Meanwhile, press reaction to the continued proposals for alternate oaths was muted. The Globe and Mail editorial of 12 December 1998 stated: [...] "The language is being drained dry, killed by a thousand smiley-faced cuts," [...] while the Ottawa Citizen was more critical on 11 December: [...] "The new citizenship oath... leaves us cold... It would strengthen the political argument for abolishing the monarchy {{on the death of}} Queen Elizabeth; and it would test monarchist support by seeing how many Canadians even notice or holler. We noticed. Consider this a holler." ...|$|E
