5|$|A {{new stage}} {{adaptation}} of the show debuted in 2003. Based on Clarke's novel The Moonbather, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> was first performed by the Scunthorpe Little Theatre Club from 7 to 11 October 2003. Using new actors to perform the roles of Compo, Clegg, and Foggy, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> featured the trio as they attempted {{to get to the}} bottom of the disturbance created by a near-naked man in the town. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> was later performed in Eastbourne by Eastbourne Theatres from 15 July 2009 to 8 August 2009 before touring the country through November 2009.|$|E
5|$|According to the backstory {{provided}} by <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> Sycorax, while pregnant with Caliban, was banished {{from her home}} in Algiers to the island on which <b>the</b> <b>play</b> takes place. Memories of Sycorax, who dies several years before the main action of <b>the</b> <b>play</b> begins, define several of the relationships in <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> Relying on his filial connection to Sycorax, Caliban claims ownership of the island. Prospero constantly reminds Ariel of Sycorax's cruel treatment to maintain the sprite's service.|$|E
5|$|Although {{best known}} as Night of January 16th, the play's title changed {{multiple}} times and several alternative titles were considered. Rand's working title was Penthouse Legend. When Clive picked up <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> he thought Rand's title suggested a fantasy story that would discourage potential patrons. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> was called The Verdict during the Hollywood Playhouse rehearsals, but opened there with the title Woman on Trial. When Woods took <b>the</b> <b>play</b> to Broadway, he insisted on a new title. He offered Rand a choice between The Black Sedan and Night of January 16th. Rand liked neither, but picked the latter. Woods later suggested two more name changes, but did not implement them. Prior to the opening, he considered renaming <b>the</b> <b>play</b> The Night is Young. After <b>the</b> <b>play</b> opened, he considered changing its name each day to match the current date.|$|E

5|$|As was {{the usual}} method of BBC {{television}} drama production at the time, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> was produced in a multi-camera electronic studio on video cameras, although it was recorded as a 35mm film telerecording rather than on videotape.

5|$|Denise Wong, the Calgarian {{actor who}} portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, said that <b>the</b> <b>play</b> {{was about the}} human condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, said that <b>the</b> <b>play</b> is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama calls {{attention to the fact that}} poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that <b>the</b> <b>play</b> will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that <b>the</b> <b>play</b> will put a face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in <b>the</b> <b>play</b> and said that, if <b>the</b> <b>play</b> was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because <b>the</b> <b>play</b> is so theatrically gripping.|$|E
5|$|Despite the controversy, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> {{was shown}} at various high-schools in the Newcastle area, and {{following}} its positive critical reception, was shown nationally at high {{schools across the}} country over a period of eighteen months. However Newcastle High School, where both Leigh and Webster had been students, declined to book <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> <b>The</b> <b>play</b> was also shown at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1993, and was shortlisted for a New South Wales Premier's Literary Award that year.|$|E
5|$|Fielding's seventh play, Rape upon Rape; or, The Justice Caught in His Own Trap, was a five-act comedic {{play that}} first ran on 23 June 1730 at the Little Theatre for eight nights. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> enjoyed some success {{until it was}} renamed The Coffee-House Politician and was altered to {{possibly}} update <b>the</b> <b>play</b> as it focused on mocking current news events. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> is a love comedy that incorporates a corrupt judge that stands in the lovers' way. Eventually, various characters attempt to stop the judge, but he prevails albeit in a comedic fashion. Fielding's focus in <b>the</b> <b>play</b> is to point out corruption in government and to attack those who abuse their power.|$|E

5|$|Fielding's thirteenth play, The Modern Husband, first ran on 14 February 1732. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> ran for 13 {{nights at}} Drury Lane, rivalling {{the run of}} the Provok'd Husband and Zara for {{production}} length. Although early-20th-century critics believed that <b>the</b> <b>play</b> could not be popular, it did make money and even put on a benefit show on 2 March 1732. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> was not revived later, possibly because the principal actors of <b>the</b> <b>play</b> died soon after and the plot of <b>the</b> <b>play</b> discouraged new actors from wanting to play the parts. The plot deals with a man selling his wife for money and the attempted abuse of the adultery laws.|$|E
5|$|Firm {{evidence}} for specific early performances of <b>the</b> <b>play</b> is scant. What is known {{is that the}} crew of the ship Red Dragon, anchored off Sierra Leone, performed Hamlet in September 1607; that <b>the</b> <b>play</b> toured in Germany within five years of Shakespeare's death; and that it was performed before James I in 1619 and Charles I in 1637. Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that, since the contemporary literature contains many allusions and references to Hamlet (only Falstaff is mentioned more, from Shakespeare), <b>the</b> <b>play</b> was surely performed with a frequency that the historical record misses.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> Soldaten. Nekrolog auf Genf (Soldiers, An {{obituary}} for Geneva) by German writer Rolf Hochhuth {{debuted in}} London. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> partially {{drew on the}} work of David Irving and contained the sensational allegation that Winston Churchill had been in on the plot. In Hochhuth's play, Sikorski and other passengers were murdered by axe-wielding British commandos. Hochhuth, unaware that the plane's pilot Eduard Prchal was still alive, accused him of participating in the plot. Prchal won a libel case that seriously affected the London theatre which staged <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> Hochhuth never paid the 50,000 British pounds imposed on him by the court and subsequently avoided returning to the UK. In 2011, he revealed his source for Churchill's involvement as Jane Ledig-Rowohlt, the British wife of his publisher Heinrich Maria Ledig-Rowohlt (née Jane Scatcherd). According to Hochhuth's biographer Birgit Lahann, these rumours relayed by Jane Ledig-Rowohlt had been the sole source for the allegations in <b>the</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>playing</b> {{field is}} a concept often used to {{describe}} level of fairness in electoral competition. With Levitsky and Way’s definition of <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field as a case in point, this paper takes a critical look at existing work on <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field, arguing that current conceptualizations suffer from lacking conceptual logic, operationalization and measurement. A new and disaggregated framework that can {{serve as the basis}} for future research on <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field is then proposed. This framework is applied to an illustrative case study on the development of <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field in Zambia under MMD rule, thereby demonstrating that it is able to capture both the changing nature of <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field and <b>the</b> differing mechanisms at play to a larger degree than the framework put forth by Levitsky and Way. The 2011 elections in Zambia also clearly highlight the importance of conceptually and empirically separating the slope of <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field from its impact on both the opposition and electoral outcomes...|$|R

5|$|In the U.S., <b>the</b> <b>play</b> {{became part}} of the {{repertory}} of Mansfield's company and was repeatedly performed during the 1890s and early 1900s.
