5|$|Carl G. Fisher, who was {{responsible}} for much of the development of Miami Beach, bought Adams Key, once known as Cocolobo Key, in 1916 and built the Cocolobo Cay Club in 1922. The two-story club building had ten guest rooms, a dining room, and a separate recreation lodge. Patrons included Warren G. Harding, Albert Fall, T. Coleman du Pont, Harvey Firestone, Jack Dempsey, Charles F. Kettering, Will Rogers and Frank Seiberling. Israel Jones' sons Lancelot and Arthur dropped out of the lime-growing business after competition from Mexican limes made their business less profitable, and after a series of devastating hurricanes in 1938 they became full-time fishing guides at the Cocolobo Club. The club had declined with the crash of 1929 which cost Fisher his fortune, but was revived by Garfield Wood in 1934. Among the Joneses' clients was avid fisherman Herbert Hoover and his family. <b>The</b> <b>Joneses</b> also provided the club with fish, lobster and crabs. Arthur and Lancelot Jones were the second largest landowners and the only permanent residents of the lower Biscayne Bay keys during the 1960s. Wood sold the Cocolobo Cay Club to a group of investors led by Miami banker Bebe Rebozo in 1954, who renamed it the Coco Lobo Fishing Club. Clients guided by <b>the</b> <b>Joneses</b> included then-senators John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Herman Talmadge and George Smathers through the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
5|$|While {{working as}} photojournalists, <b>the</b> <b>Joneses</b> {{continued}} to volunteer on archaeological excavations around Britain, and in 1956 they began {{working as a}} freelance archaeologist for the Ministry of Works. At the time the Ministry {{was responsible for the}} upkeep of Ancient Monuments and, by extension, the large volume of rescue archaeology required to document archaeological sites before they were destroyed by the postwar construction boom. A small workforce of itinerant archaeologists were employed to excavate these sites in advance of development. Between 1956 and 1965, Margaret Jones directed a number of such excavations in Buckinghamshire, Yorkshire and Lincolnshire (including Old Sleaford).|$|E

25|$|After {{arriving}} in Belo Horizonte, <b>the</b> <b>Joneses</b> rented a modest three-bedroom home. Jones studied {{the local economy}} and receptiveness of racial minorities to his message, though language remained a barrier. He also explored local Brazilian syncretic religions. Jones {{was careful not to}} portray himself as a communist in a foreign territory, and spoke of an apostolic communal lifestyle rather than of Castro or Marx. Ultimately, the lack of resources in the locale caused <b>the</b> <b>Joneses</b> to move to Rio de Janeiro in mid-1963. There, they worked with the poor in Rio's slums.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Jones {{seems to}} have {{directed}} the school more autocratically after 1953, when the assistant of Bob Jones Sr., Theodore Mercer, was fired, allegedly for trying to lead a faculty rebellion against <b>the</b> <b>Joneses.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two {{years later}} in 1961, <b>the</b> <b>Joneses</b> became the first white couple in Indiana to adopt a black child, James Warren Jones, Jr. The couple also adopted another son, who was white, named Tim.

50|$|In 1907, {{architect}} Frank Lloyd Wright {{designed the}} home, “Tan-y-deri”, for Jane and Andrew Porter, {{his sister and}} brother-in-law. The home was built in a valley {{in the town of}} Wyoming, Wisconsin (near the town of Spring Green). This valley was originally settled by <b>the</b> Lloyd <b>Joneses,</b> who were <b>the</b> family of Wright and his sister's mother. <b>The</b> Lloyd <b>Joneses</b> were originally from Wales and, {{as a result of this}} heritage, Wright chose a Welsh name for the Porter home: “Tan-y-deri” is Welsh for “Under the oaks”.|$|R

25|$|Jesse Bushyhead died in 1844, but Evan Jones {{kept the}} mission going until the Civil War. John Buttrick Jones joined {{his father in}} this work in 1855. John had {{graduated}} from the University of Rochester and married there earlier that year. The mission had acquired a printing press and <b>the</b> <b>Joneses</b> began publishing a monthly newspaper called the Cherokee Messenger. The paper was printed partly in Cherokee and partly in English.|$|E
25|$|In 1856, <b>the</b> <b>Joneses</b> helped {{organize}} a secret anti-slavery organization, the Keetoowah Society, among the full-blood Cherokees, {{to counter the}} influence of a secret pro-slavery group. The members vowed to elect anti-slavery candidates to tribal office and to keep the Cherokee Nation neutral in case war broke out between the American states over the slavery issue. Although their meetings were held in the woods with traditional dances and debates, they always opened with prayers by Cherokee Baptist preachers.|$|E
25|$|By 1851, New Bedford had {{completely}} displaced Nantucket {{as the center}} of American whaling. In that year, Edward Coffin Jones, a Nantucket native who had moved to New Bedford and become a successful ship owner, bought the house for $17,000. <b>The</b> <b>Joneses</b> expanded the garden, adding the pergola, a common Victorian touch. One of his daughters, Amelia Hickling Jones, lived there for the next 85 years, becoming a major civic benefactor as the city transitioned from whaling to textiles as the mainstay of its economy. With no heirs, the property was put up for sale when she died in 1935.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Joneses</b> were {{assisted}} by many younger archaeologists and 'volunteers' from Britain and abroad {{including more than}} 3,000 students from many countries. The volunteers lived mainly in tents during the warmer months, but in the winter, occupied old caravans and sheds. The organisation of the camp, the feeding, the pay and the volunteers' welfare involved many individuals guided by terse memos signed by the initials 'muj'. Jones sometimes commented {{that it was more}} like a holiday camp than an archaeological dig. In the final stages of the dig, volunteers were supplemented by local unemployed people, funded by a government job creation scheme. Without this extra assistance, the excavation might not have been completed.|$|E
500|$|Julian Glover as Walter Donovan: An American {{businessman}} who sends <b>the</b> <b>Joneses</b> on {{their quest for}} the Holy Grail. Donovan works for the Nazis and desires immortality.

His upcoming movie roles include the political thriller Beirut and the drama Nostalgia. Hamm appeared in the SpongeBob SquarePants episode [...] "Factory Fresh".|$|E
500|$|The film's {{exploration}} of {{fathers and sons}} coupled with its use of religious imagery is comparable to two other 1989 films, [...] and Field of Dreams. Writing for The New York Times, Caryn James felt the combination in these films reflected New Age concerns, where the worship of God was equated to searching for fathers. James felt that neither Indiana or his father is preoccupied with finding the Grail or defeating the evil Nazis, but that, rather, both seek professional respect for one another in their boys' own adventure. James contrasted the temple's biblically epic destruction with the more effective and quiet conversation between <b>the</b> <b>Joneses</b> at the film's end. James noted that Indiana's mother {{does not appear in}} the prologue, being portrayed as already having died before the film's events began.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{evaluated}} positively after its release. Internet reviewer James Berardinelli wrote {{that while the}} film did not reach the heights of Raiders of the Lost Ark, it [...] " [...] the lows of The Temple of Doom. A fitting end to the original trilogy, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade captures some {{of the sense of}} fun that infused the first movie while using the addition of Sean Connery to up the comedic ante and provide a father/son dynamic." [...] Neil Smith of the BBC praised the action, but said the drama and comedy between <b>the</b> <b>Joneses</b> was more memorable. He noted, [...] "The emphasis on the Jones boys means Julian Glover's venal villain and Alison Doody's treacherous beauty are sidelined, while the climax [...] one booby-trapped tomb too many." [...] Based on 55 reviews listed by Rotten Tomatoes, 88% of critics praised the film, giving it an average score of 8/10. Metacritic calculated an average rating of 65/100, based on 14 reviews.|$|E

25|$|Soon after Wright turned 14, {{his parents}} separated. Anna had been unhappy {{for some time}} with William's {{inability}} to provide for his family {{and asked him to}} leave.
