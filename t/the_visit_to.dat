5|$|The acropolis {{buildings}} contain inscribed graffiti {{dating to}} the last phase of occupation in the Early Postclassic, including human and animal figures, deities, temples and courtly scenes.

5|$|The new {{grandstand}} {{was open}} for the first home match of the season, against Bolton Wanderers, and those spectators not distracted by <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> the city of the Duke and Duchess of York (the future George V and Queen Mary) saw a much improved performance from the forwards that produced a 2–1 win with goals from Frank Mobley and Wheldon. <b>The</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> Wolverhampton Wanderers ended in defeat by the same score. Oliver conceded a penalty kick for a foul on Charlie Reynolds, Wheldon equalised before half-time, and Wolverhampton regained the lead straight after the interval.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} novels in the series, aspects of Thunderball come from Fleming's own experiences: <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> the health clinic was inspired by his own 1955 trip to the Enton Hall health farm and Bond's medical record, as read out to him by M, is a slightly modified version of Fleming's own. The name of the health farm, Shrublands, was taken {{from that of a}} house owned by the parents of his wife's friend, Peter Quennell. Fleming dedicates a quarter of the novel to the Shrublands setting and the naturalist cure Bond undergoes.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the tour}} began, MacLaren {{resigned}} as Lancashire's captain and assistant secretary, owing to {{his concern for}} the health of his wife. Journalists speculated that MacLaren would join the Hampshire team as assistant secretary, as he lived in that county, or even move to Australia. Lancashire selected a replacement captain, but when MacLaren returned to England, he re-committed to the club, stating <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> Australia had improved the health of his wife, and he was reappointed.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{she visited}} Iran at the {{invitation}} of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The British ambassador and his wife, Anthony and Sheila Parsons, noted how the Iranians were bemused by her habit of speaking to everyone regardless of status or importance, and hoped the Shah's entourage would learn from <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> pay more attention to ordinary people. Between 1976 and 1984, she made annual summer visits to France, which were among 22 private trips to continental Europe between 1963 and 1992.|$|E
5|$|Lingerie model Emily Diamond {{has a role}} as {{a prostitute}} who teases Jory Cassel during <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> the brothel.

Also appearing in this episode is the casting team's Robert Sterne, who reprises his cameo role as a page in King's Landing.|$|E

5|$|A life-size {{model of}} the light cycle was put on display at a booth at Fan Expo 2009 in Toronto, Ontario from August 28–30, 2009, along with a special {{presentation}} of material from the production. The conceptual art shown at Comic-Con was shown in the session, along with some test film of the martial artists who play a more athletic style of Disc Wars. A segment from the film showed Flynn's son entering the now-decrepit arcade, playing a Tron stand-up arcade video game, noticing a passage in {{the wall behind the}} Tron game and entering it, the passage closing behind him. Flynn's son makes <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> the arcade after Alan Bradley receives a page from the disconnected phone number of the arcade. The footage was used later as part of the trailer released on March 5, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Amid the {{euphoria}} generated by Egypt's military intervention, serious unity discussions commenced between Syria and Egypt. Towards {{the end of}} October, Anwar al-Sadat, the Egyptian speaker of parliament, visited the Syrian parliament in Damascus {{in a gesture of}} solidarity, only for <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> end with the Syrian parliament voting unanimously to enter into a union with Egypt without delay. A Syrian delegation then headed for Cairo to persuade Nasser to accept unity with Syria, but Nasser expressed his reservations regarding unity to the delegates and Quwatli, who was in Damascus. Nasser was wary of the Syrian military's habitual interference in the country's political affairs and the stark difference in the countries' economies and political systems. The Syrian political and military leadership continued to press Nasser out of both sincere commitment to Arab nationalism and a realization that only unification with Egypt could prevent impending strife in the country due to increasing communist influence.|$|E
5|$|During his {{successful}} {{campaign for the}} U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more proactive anti-communist policy, promising to roll back communism, rather than contain it. Working {{in an atmosphere of}} increasing McCarthyism in government circles, Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use the CIA to depose governments the U.S. disliked. Although PBFORTUNE had been quickly aborted, tension between the U.S. and Guatemala continued to rise, especially with the legalization of the communist PGT, and its inclusion in the government coalition for the elections of January 1953. Articles published in the U.S. press often reflected this predisposition to see communist influence; for example, a New York Times article about <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> Guatemala by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda highlighted his communist beliefs, but neglected to mention his reputation as the greatest living poet in Latin America.|$|E

5|$|During {{the two-week}} hiatus between games four and five, the Canadians visited Sweden and played two {{exhibition}} games versus the Swedish national team. The Team Canada management {{had arranged for}} <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> Sweden {{to get used to}} the bigger ice surfaces in Europe, and stopping in Sweden would provide some rest for Team Canada before resuming the series in Moscow. The games took place on September 16 and September 17 at the Johanneshovs Isstadion arena in Stockholm. Canada won game one 4–1; the second game was a 4–4 tie. The first exhibition game introduced Canada to the two West German referees, Josef Kompalla and Franz Baader. These two referees would figure prominently in games six and eight of the Canada-Russia series.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Baden {{returned}} {{to active duty}} {{to take part in}} a naval tour of the Baltic by the newly crowned Kaiser Wilhelm II. Rear Admiral Eduard Knorr, the commander of the fleet, raised his flag aboard Baden during the voyage. The fleet stopped in St. Petersburg, Stockholm, and Copenhagen on the seventeen-day cruise. Baden ran aground in the harbors of both Stockholm and Copenhagen, but was not seriously damaged in either incident. Baden also participated in <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> Great Britain in August 1889, where Wilhelm II took part in the Cowes Regatta. Baden and the rest of the fleet joined the Royal Navy in a fleet review for Queen Victoria.|$|E
5|$|In February 1957, Melbourne {{was sent}} to the Royal Hobart Regatta. Following this, she {{travelled}} to New Zealand, where she participated in exercises with HMNZS Royalist and visited several New Zealand ports. The first of several annual three-month deployments to Southeast Asia as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve began in April, with Melbourne returning to Darwin at the end of June. The carrier {{spent the rest of the}} year visiting Australian ports for open inspections by the public. During <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> Port Adelaide, on 28 October 1957, Melbourne was slightly damaged when she was struck by MV Straat Lanka—the first of several minor collisions the carrier would experience throughout her career. Operations for the year concluded with participation in Exercise Astrolabe off Lord Howe Island, with ships from the RAN, Royal Navy, and Royal New Zealand Navy, before returning to Sydney on 13 December.|$|E
40|$|Although obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYNs) are {{the main}} actors in the {{provision}} of health care to women, their practice patterns have rarely been analyzed. The current study investigated <b>the</b> nationwide ambulatory <b>visits</b> <b>to</b> OB-GYNs in Taiwan using the National Health Insurance Research Database. From the 1 / 500 sampling datasets indicating 619, 760 ambulatory visits in 2012, it was found that 5. 8 % (n = 35, 697) of <b>the</b> <b>visits</b> were made <b>to</b> OB-GYNs. Two-fifths of the services provided were performed by male OB-GYNs aged 50 – 59 years.

5|$|In June 2015, Doyle {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with Blackpool, newly relegated to League One. He was named club captain, and selected as starting goalkeeper, ahead of Kyle Letheren, {{for the opening}} match of the season, away to Colchester United. He made several saves to keep his team in the match, but damaged a shoulder in thwarting Colchester's Gavin Massey and {{had to leave the}} field. After an initial prognosis of three months out, a scan suggested he could return to action within a month. He was back in the team for <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> Scunthorpe United on 5 September, and produced a man-of-the-match performance that earned him a place in the Football League's Team of the Week as Blackpool won their first match of the season. Ankle ligament damage suffered in early November kept him out until the new year.|$|E
5|$|In their {{passage to}} the final Manchester City faced {{opposition}} from the top division {{in all but one}} round. Second Division Woolwich Arsenal, City's opponents in the second round, were the exception. Sunderland were defeated 3–2 at Hyde Road in the first round, and <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> Arsenal yielded a 2–0 win. A club record crowd of 30,022 watched the quarter-final against Middlesbrough, but a 0–0 draw meant a replay at Ayresome Park was required, which City won 3–1 to set up a semi-final against The Wednesday. Two goals from Turnbull and one from Meredith gave City a 3–0 win at Goodison Park.|$|E
5|$|On Midsummer 1953 Gardner invited Valiente {{again to}} Woodford-Grimes's house, {{and it was}} here that he {{initiated}} her into Wicca in a ritual during which they stood before an altar and he read from his Book of Shadows. The three of them then set off to the prehistoric monument of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, where they witnessed the Druids performing a ritual there. Gardner had lent a ritual sword which he owned to the Druids, who placed it within the monument's Heel Stone during their rite. Valiente told her husband and mother about <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> Stonehenge, but not about her initiation, of which, she feared, they would not have approved.|$|E

Pat had ordered <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> be kept secret from the media until after the trip's conclusion. In doing so, she attempted to maintain privacy for the Kennedys. She also invited President Kennedy's mother Rose Kennedy to see her son's official portrait.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} second inauguration on March 4, 1901, William and Ida McKinley {{undertook}} a six-week {{tour of the}} nation. Traveling mostly by rail, the McKinleys were to travel through the South to the Southwest, and then up the Pacific coast and east again, to conclude with a visit on June 13, 1901, to the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. However, the First Lady fell ill in California, causing her husband to limit his public events and cancel a series of speeches {{he had planned to}} give urging trade reciprocity. He also postponed <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> the fair until September, planning a month in Washington and two in Canton before the Buffalo visit.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known sketch (№ 236) {{is made in}} graphite and {{is located}} in the Carl Larsson museum in Sundborn.

In July, Larsson started to paint a large version, which was finished in January 1911, but it is only preserved in a photograph. It is based on the early sketch but it presents a richer set of figures in the foreground. The early version was put on display in Nationalmuseum without receiving any official comments. There was no formal order and no official contest had been declared, and the initiative was only Larsson's.|$|E
