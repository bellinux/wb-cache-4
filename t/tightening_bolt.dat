40|$|Fatigue cracks {{have been}} {{reported}} in the super structure of the surface ships in the navy. Repair techniques have been proposed and applied on compact tension specimens. Such techniques were; either by creating compressive residual stresses using welding anisotropy, local plastic deformation and spot heating. Or, constraining the crack tip using <b>tightened</b> <b>bolt</b> or steel/carbon fibre patches. Complete F. C. G. data were obtained for the metal in the as-rolled and welded conditions. A metallurgical study has also been made. Fractography, the influence of residual stresses and second phases have been studied. The study showed that superior crack resistance was obtained from spot heated specimens, which were very simple to prepare. Considerable retardation was also obtained using welding anisotropy, local plastic deformation and <b>tightened</b> <b>bolts.</b> Patching seems to provide limited improvement. The influence of compressive residual stress was found to improve the crack resistance. The influence of the inclusions was found to depend on their morphology. Medium sized and homogeneously distributed inclusions provided a retarding effect on the crack speed. More inclusion interaction was reported in the presence of residual stresses...|$|R

50|$|Since 2014 it is {{possible}} to torque <b>tighten</b> <b>bolts</b> without the use of a reaction arm, and thus without pinch point. This is a great break-through in the industry. Reaction arm free torqueing {{is possible}} due to the usage of a reaction washer. The knurled side of the washer hold on to the construction/flange and the bolt or nut turn over a smooth and through-hardened surface. The reaction washer will become a stationary object underneath the nut, eliminating the use of reaction arms.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tighten</b> the <b>bolts</b> on the flange. Due to vibration, {{temperature}} changes, {{and other}} factors such as spiral wound gasket stress relaxation, the bolt tension will gradually decrease, resulting in loss of torque, causing a leak. In general longer bolts and smaller diameters of bolt are better at preventing the loss of torque. A long thin bolt is {{an effective way to}} prevent torque loss. Heating for {{a certain period of time}} to stretch the bolt, and then maintaining a given torque, is very effective in preventing the loss of torque. When the gasket is thinner and smaller there will be a greater loss of torque. In addition, prevent strong vibration of the machine and the pipe itself, and isolate them from adjacent equipment vibration. Impacts on the sealing surface are not meaningless. Not impacting the <b>tightened</b> <b>bolts</b> can prevent the loss of torque.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Plastic region {{tightening}} {{is widely}} used in critical bolted joints in internal combustion engines {{in order to reduce}} the engine weight by maximizing the use of load-carrying capacity of bolt. Mechanical behavior of <b>bolt</b> <b>tightened</b> in plastic region under external axial tensile load is investigated for various friction conditions using three dimensional finite element analysis. The behavior of <b>bolt</b> <b>tightened</b> in elastic region as well as that in tensile test are investigated for comparison. Tightening process is simulated by rotating the bolt in order to examine the friction effect realistically. It is revealed that the <b>bolt</b> <b>tightened</b> in plastic region can carry more external load until the joint is opened, and yields at lower bolt load than the <b>bolt</b> <b>tightened</b> in elastic region. The friction coefficient has effect on the yield load, but not on the load-carrying capacity. Moreover, the scatter in the bolt preload due to friction begins with plastic deformation of bolt in the angle tightening control, whereas it begins with the onset of tightening in the torque tightening control. The observations are interpreted with the residual torsional stress in the bolt generated during the tightening...|$|R
40|$|In {{the modern}} wind turbine industry, {{one of the}} core {{processes}} is the assembly of the bolt-nut connections of the hub, which requires <b>tightening</b> <b>bolts</b> and nuts to obtain well-distributed clamping force all over the hub. This force deals with nonlinear uncertainties due to the mechanical properties and {{it depends on the}} final torque and relative angular position of the bolt/nut connection. This paper handles the control problem of automated <b>bolt</b> <b>tightening</b> processes. To develop a controller, the process is divided into four stages, according to the mechanical characteristics of the bolt/nut connection: a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) with expert knowledge of tightening process and error detection capability is proposed. For each one of the four stages, an individual FLC is designed to address the highly non-linearity of the system and the error scenarios related to that stage, to promptly prevent and avoid mechanical damage. The FLC is implemented and real time executed on an industrial PC and finally validated. Experimental results show the performance of the controller to reach precise torque and angle levels as well as desired clamping force. The capability of error detection is also validated. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of sold-separate clamp has a single {{horizontal}} bolt-with-nut which goes behind the top of the seat post. <b>Tightening</b> this <b>bolt</b> brings together four pieces of metal (two on each side) which have round slots to grab and hold standard-size rails. The inner rail grabbing pieces have interlocking grooves on the other side that interface into disc shapes on the outer sides of the central post-grabbing piece. Continued <b>tightening</b> of the <b>bolt</b> causes the central piece to close very slightly around the top of the post. To adjust the saddle's position for comfort, loosening the bolt allows the rails to slide forward and backward and to tilt up and down around the axis of the bolt.|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring seismic reevaluation of {{a process}} column, {{it was found that}} anchor bolts are not {{adequate}} for the present seismic load. A retrofitting scheme using friction dampers of 30 kN capacity has been worked out for its qualification. Double Sliding Friction Dampers (DSFD) have been designed and fabricated. Friction dampers absorb vibration energy by friction forces between contacting plates. Normal force required to induce desired slip load is applied through pre-tensioning of the bolts. The pre-tensioning of bolts is done by <b>tightening</b> <b>bolts</b> to a specified value of torque using wrench. The bolt torque required to obtain desired slip load of damper is obtained from the damper characteristics. The characterization of friction dampers has been carried out by means of cyclic tests using hydraulic actuator. In the present paper, the details of friction damper and characterization are provided. The details of retrofitting of process column using these dampers are also presented...|$|R

Loads up to 20,000,000 pounds and greater are attainable using only hand tools. MJTs and related products are produced by Superbolt, Inc. in Carnegie, PA.|$|R
