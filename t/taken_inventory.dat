40|$|In {{a period}} in which space-human {{interaction}} has achieved different dimensions, it is necessary for spaces having natural, socio-cultural heritage values which are unique and {{would not be able to}} reproduce to be put urgently under protection. Also Ortaköy (Šapinuwa-Çorum) district is within such spaces. Aim of this study is to examine geographically natural, socio-cultural heritage values of Ortaköy district which have not been examined academically enough until today. Such an examination will be able to contribute for socio-cultural-economic development of the district, which is Šapinuwa&İncesu Canyon-oriented, to be conducted within a structure out of nature and culture destruction. Ortaköy hosts to authentic heritage values of natural (such as İncesu Canyon etc.); tangible socio-cultural (such as the Hittite capital Šapinuwa, traditional apparel, food culture, handicrafts etc.); and intangible socio-cultural (such as traditional weddings-yallis, folk minstrels-poets, regional folk songs, riddles-legends, indigenous words, folk medicine, kids games, festivals-carnivals etc.). It is necessary for natural and socio-cultural heritage values of Ortaköy to be <b>taken</b> <b>inventory</b> and planned by an expert team. It is possible for these values to be able to turn into tourism supply and to contribute to the district economy by using lands according to their capability classes, as well as cooperation of official and civil institutions-organizations, and relevant persons...|$|E
