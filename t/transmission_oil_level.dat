50|$|Changes {{occurred}} for the 1987 model year. On the interior, the 1987 944 Turbo for North America {{became the first}} production car {{in the world to}} be equipped with driver and passenger side air bags as standard equipment. A low <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> light was added to the dash as well as a 180 mi/h km/h speedometer as opposed to the 170 mi/h km/h speedometer on the 1986 model Turbos. Also included is the deletion of the <b>transmission</b> <b>oil</b> cooler, and a change in suspension control arms to reduce the car's scrub radius. The engine remained the same M44/51 as in the 1986 model.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{industrial}} or automotive dip lubricated gear drives, low <b>oil</b> <b>levels</b> {{may be used}} due {{to different}} design requirements or constraints. A variation of the sump <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> affects different working conditions of gears, such as the power loss, the heat generation, and the load-carrying capacity with respect to different types of damage. In particular, reduced <b>oil</b> <b>levels</b> decrease the scuffing load capacity of gears because of high bulk temperatures and reduced oil quantity in the gear mesh. Investigations were made in a back-to-back hypoid gear test rig to evaluate the influence of the bath <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> on the scuffing load-carrying capacity of dip lubricated hypoid gears...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The issue under {{discussion}} {{in this paper}} results from a practical task faced with research institutions and manufacturers for gas station equipment, and will {{be divided into two}} parts: 1. In order to observe the impact of storage tank displacement on tank gage table, the author, on the premise of the displacements parameters, to detect the corresponding values of <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> and volume and analyze the law of change of the tank gage table through modeling and provided a revised tank gage table. The above belongs to direct problem. 2. Based on the data from practical detection, the paper will identify how the displacement occurred and the level of the displacement. Meanwhile, the measure and result of calibration will be offered. All the above belongs to inverse problem. 1. Topic Background Usually, gas stations are equipped with several underground storage tanks for oil, and a corresponding <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> measurement system, through whose flow meter and level meter, can give an updated measurement for such data as volume of oil inflow/outflow and the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> in the tank according to the tank gage table set beforehand (i. e. the corresponding relationship between height of <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> and the <b>oil</b> quantity), so as to get changes of the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> and quantity...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was the {{examination}} of the morphological and compositional attributes of wear particles of tested universal tractor <b>transmission</b> <b>oil</b> (UTTO) samples by means of automatic particle counter and classifier LaserNetFinesTM-C, which is an ideal tool to establish the dynamic equilibrium concentration and hence to set the alarm limits for any type of machine. Such limits can be based on wear type and particle size ranges. The samples of two UTTO (mineral oil and biodegradable fully synthetic oil) were taken from the rear gearboxes of the wheel tractor during a long-term experiment. The measurement results showed that there was faster increase in the particle wear of mineral oil in comparison to biodegradable <b>transmission</b> <b>oil.</b> Considering the increase in the percentage of particles over 20 μm, the biodegradable oil seems to be more favourable for usage. Regardless of this, it can be concluded that the biodegradable oil is equivalent to petroleum-based oils...|$|R
