5|$|The {{change to}} an AC system was a {{significant}} improvement. The Vulcan's powered flying controls were hydraulically actuated but each powered flying control unit (PFCU) had a hydraulic pump which was driven by an electric motor. Because there was no manual reversion, a total electrical failure {{would result in a}} loss of control. The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time but this proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>optimistic</b> and two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result.|$|E
25|$|Importantly, however, Canada revived Third Option {{ideals of}} {{political}} and economic distinctiveness that was briefly lost to Joe Clark’s Progressive Conservatives from June 1979 to February 1980. Diversification and distinctiveness of Canadian policy were evident in Trudeau’s creation of the National Energy Program, the extension of the Foreign Investment Review Agency, and the formulation of specific Central American policy in 1982. Such advancements in Canadian policy were almost immediately contested by the United States. At any rate, Canada had good reason <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>optimistic</b> in the international sphere. Unfortunately, just as Trudeau’s policies of peace and diplomacy in Latin America began to peak the Latin American debt crisis retarded any potential growth beginning in 1982. In fact, in a four-year period between 1980 and 1984 Canadian exports to Latin America were cut in half. Despite this setback, Canadian investment in the region remained high and the government of Canada remained committed to the pursuit of mutually beneficial relations between the two regions.|$|E

[...] A 1991 review said that, [...] "The evening got off to a good, punchy start, then dwindled irretrievably into sophomoric hijinks." [...] A 1993 review stated that, [...] "Iso is after laughs and it gets them. But its targets are threadbare just when dance could use some sharp satirists."

Bolkovac responded, [...] "Unfortunately, the widespread horror is already there. This {{is not going to}} be simple or a quick fix."

Kondracki added that while she wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>optimistic</b> and hoped that the screening would [...] "lead to genuine discussion and thought about the UN's involvement in sex trafficking and other crimes", she worried that it might not have the desired lasting impact: [...] "I know we are going to hear a lot about what has been done since the time depicted in this film, but rhetoric only goes so far.

500|$|Durant {{entered the}} 2009 {{season as the}} club's {{starting}} quarterback, but head coach Ken Miller gave backup Jyles significant playing time as well. Durant {{made the most of}} his opportunity, becoming the first Roughrider quarterback to start all 18 games since Kent Austin, who last played for the club in 1993. Durant's consistency on the field {{was one of the reasons}} he earned the Roughriders' starting quarterback position, along with his ability to run for yards when his pass protection breaks down. Durant was named the Roughriders nominee for CFL Most Outstanding Player, and was selected a West Division All-Star at quarterback. He was also named the Roughriders' Wireless Age Most Popular Player. Durant led the Roughriders to the Grey Cup, where they were defeated by the Montreal Alouettes on a last second field goal. He finished the 2009 season with 4,348 passing yards and 501 rushing yards. Durant threw 24 touchdown passes during the season and also had 21 interceptions, leading the CFL. Heading into the 2010 season, Durant wanted to cut down on his interceptions, although he tried <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>optimistic,</b> [...] "I throw 21 picks last year and I guarantee every guy with better stats than me wishes they were in the Grey Cup." ...|$|E

This was a challenge for Shorter, who found much of the South African music he worked with <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>optimistic</b> and joyful. Unable to get the African drums to sound dark and heavy, Shorter used a combination of taiko drums and synthesized instruments for the desired effects, with the core African elements of the score conveyed in the vocals and smaller percussion.

2500|$|Survival is {{the term}} used for {{what happens to a}} person after he/she has already {{developed}} or contracted a serious illness. [...] Although happiness has been shown to increase health, with survival, {{this may not be the}} case. Survival may be the only area of health that evidence suggests happiness may actually be sometimes detrimental. It is unclear why exactly research results suggest this is the case, however Diener & Biswas-Diener offer an explanation. It is possible that happy people fail to report symptoms of the illness, which can ultimately lead to no treatment or inadequate treatment. Another possible reason may be that happy people tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>optimistic,</b> leading them to take their symptoms too lightly, seek treatment too late, and/or follow the doctor’s instructions half-heartedly. And lastly, Diener & Biswas-Diener suggest that people with serious illnesses may be more likely to choose to live out the rest of their days without painful or invasive treatments.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, Harris {{wrote that}} the August rain fell on both sides but that it benefited the defenders, because it made {{observation}} from the air harder, which {{was more of a}} disadvantage to the British and French who had far more guns than the Germans.

The II Corps attack scheduled for 2 August was postponed until 10 August and fresh divisions attacked a limited objective. The ground was still waterlogged, British counter-battery fire failed to suppress the German artillery and the attack was a costly and failed at the most vital point. By late August confidence in the handling of the battle by the Fifth Army HQ at GHQ, among the corps and divisional staffs had diminished but intelligence reports continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>optimistic</b> about the strain being imposed on the Germans.

2500|$|Various studies (most [...] {{originating}} from North America) have reported {{a positive correlation}} between spirituality and mental well-being in both healthy people and those encountering a range of physical illnesses or psychological disorders. Although spiritual individuals tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>optimistic,</b> report greater social support, and experience higher intrinsic meaning in life, strength, and inner peace., whether [...] the correlation represents a causal link remains contentious. Both supporters and opponents of this claim agree that past statistical findings are difficult to interpret, {{in large part because of}} the ongoing disagreement over how spirituality should be defined and measured. There is also evidence that an agreeable / positive temperament and/or a tendency toward sociability (which all correlate with spirituality) might actually be the key psychological features that predispose people to subsequently adopt a spiritual orientation and that these characteristics, not spiritually per se, add to well-being. There is also some suggestion that the benefits associated with spirituality and religiosity might arise from being a member of a close-knit community. Social bonds available via secular sources (i.e., [...] not unique to spirituality or faith-based groups) might just as effectively raise well-being. In sum, spirituality may not be the [...] "active ingredient" [...] (i.e. past association with psychological well-being measures might reflect a reverse causation or effects from other variables that correlate with spirituality), and that the effects of agreeableness, conscientiousness, or virtue—personality traits common in many non-spiritual people yet known to be slightly more common among the spiritual—may better account for spirituality's apparent correlation with mental health and social support.|$|E
