5000|$|Smaller <b>truck</b> <b>stops</b> might {{consist of}} only a parking area, a fueling station, and perhaps a diner restaurant. Larger <b>truck</b> <b>stops</b> might have {{convenience}} stores of various sizes, showers, a small video arcade, and a TV/movie theater (usually just a projector with an attached DVD player). The largest <b>truck</b> <b>stops,</b> like Iowa 80 (the largest in the world), might have several independent businesses operating under one roof, catering {{to a wide range}} of travelers' needs, and might have several major and minor fast-food chains operating a small food court. Larger <b>truck</b> <b>stops</b> also tend to have full-service maintenance facilities for heavy trucks, as well as vehicle wash services that can handle anything from passenger vehicles to large <b>trucks.</b> Some <b>truck</b> <b>stops</b> operate motels or have them adjacent. Most <b>truck</b> <b>stops</b> now offer separate fueling areas, often with dedicated entrances, for standard-sized passenger vehicles. The truck refueling area almost always offers dual pumps, one on each side, so large trucks can fill both tanks at once.

5000|$|<b>Truck</b> <b>stops</b> {{were often}} {{depicted}} in films and novels as being somewhat seedy places, frequented by aggressive bikers, petty criminals, and prostitutes (e.g. the [...] "lot lizards" [...] in the JT LeRoy novel Sarah). This {{might be an}} outdated stereotype, as most modern <b>truck</b> <b>stops</b> are generally clean and safe, becoming a [...] "home away from home" [...] for many truck drivers. However, most <b>truck</b> <b>stops</b> reflect the social environment of their local area; consequently, one occasionally finds seedy <b>truck</b> <b>stops</b> in seedy areas. According to John McPhee's book Uncommon Carriers, <b>truck</b> <b>stops</b> in rural areas are typically very safe and wholesome. However, as the distance to major cities decrease the incidence of prostitution, drug peddling etc. increases dramatically. The Vince Lombardi service area on the New Jersey Turnpike near New York City has the most rampant prostitution.|$|R
