500|$|Although {{it was an}} {{unfinished}} demo, [...] "Earth Angel" [...] began to see immediate success. Williams carried a rough acetate dub with him to Dolphin's of Hollywood All Night Record Shop, a local record store, to gauge shop owner John Dolphin's opinion. Dolphin broadcast a late-night rhythm and blues broadcast from his store, and KGFJ disc jockey Dick Hugg was sitting in. Hugg played {{both sides of the}} single, and by the next morning, requests began coming in for the song. As a result, Williams abandoned an idea to overdub additional instrumentation and began immediate manufacturing of the 7" [...] single to issue it as soon as possible. Still convinced [...] "Hey Señorita" [...] would be the hit, it was pressed to the A-side; disc jockeys soon began flipping the record in favor of [...] "Earth Angel". The demand for [...] "Earth Angel" [...] nearly bankrupted Dootone; producer Walter Williams ran out of label paper, leading the single <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> multiple colored labels. It made its first appearance in Billboard as a territorial hit for Los Angeles, becoming the second best-selling R single in Los Angeles for the second week of October 1954. It climbed to number one for the city by November 13, after which it began to grow in popularity in New York, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and Nashville.|$|E
60|$|Shout succeeded shout, as {{each new}} {{encouraging}} proof appeared; and the admiral, yielding to the ardor of the crews, ordered sail <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> all the vessels, that each might endeavor to outstrip the others, {{in the hope}} of being the first to discover the expected island. This strife soon separated the caravels, the Pinta easily outsailing the other two, while the Santa Maria and the Niña came on more slowly, in her rear. All was gaiety and mirth, the livelong day, on board those isolated vessels, that, unknown to those they held, were navigating the middle of the Atlantic, with horizon extending beyond horizon, without change in the watery boundary, as circle would form without circle, on the same element, were a vast mass of solid matter suddenly dropped into the sea.|$|E

6000|$|... “Well, you see, he had {{to think}} of others as well as himself. For the family to have gone back into the Crispina thraldom after having tasted the delights of liberty {{would have been a}} tragedy, and there were even wider {{considerations}} to be taken into account. Since his bereavement he had unconsciously taken up a far bolder and more initiatory line in public affairs, and his popularity and influence had increased correspondingly. From being merely a strong man in the political world he began to be spoken of as the strong man. All this he knew would be jeopardised if he once more dropped into the social position of the husband of Mrs. Umberleigh. He was a rich man, and the £2000 a year, though not exactly a fleabite, did not seem an extravagant price to pay for the boarding-out of Crispina. Of course, he had severe qualms of conscience about the arrangement. Later on, when he took me into his confidence, he told me that in paying the ransom, or hush-money as I should have called it, he was partly influenced by the fear that if he refused it the kidnappers might have vented their rage and disappointment on their captive. It was better, he said, to think of her being well cared for as a highly-valued paying-guest in one of the Lofoden Islands than to have her struggling miserably home in a maimed and mutilated condition. Anyway he paid the yearly instalment as punctually as one pays a fire insurance, and with equal promptitude there would come an acknowledgment of the money and a brief statement to the effect that Crispina was in good health and fairly cheerful spirits. One report even mentioned that she was busying herself with a scheme for proposed reforms in Church management <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> the local pastorate. Another spoke of a rheumatic attack and a journey to a ‘cure’ on the mainland, and on that occasion an additional eighty pounds was demanded and conceded. Of course it was to the interest of the kidnappers to keep their charge in good health, but the secrecy with which they managed to shroud their arrangements argued a really wonderful organisation. If my uncle was paying a rather high price, at least he could console himself with the reflection that he was paying specialists’ fees.” ...|$|E

And yet her {{attachment}} to the present dynasty being very sincere, and even ardent, more especially as her family had served his late Majesty both in peace and war, she experienced a little embarrassment in reconciling her opinions respecting the exiled family with those she entertained for the present. In fact, like many an old Jacobite, she <b>was</b> contented <b>to</b> <b>be</b> somewhat inconsistent on the subject, comforting herself that NOW everything stood as it ought to do, {{and that there was no}} use in looking back narrowly on the right or wrong of the matter half a century ago.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in the former Soviet Union by state-owned label Melodiya, featuring material from Lear's first three studio albums, released between 1977 and 1979. The LP mostly consists of songs from Never Trust a Pretty Face, {{to the extent that}} it retains the original track listing of its side B. The only track from that album not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> approved of by the Russian authorities was the German wartime classic [...] "Lili Marleen". The compilation features two tracks from Sweet Revenge and only one song from I Am a Photograph, omitting most of Lear's greatest hits of the disco era. While a number of flexi discs with Lear's recordings {{was released in}} both the Soviet Union and other parts of the Eastern Bloc during the 1980s, the Poet Amanda Lear compilation was one of the few releases <b>to</b> actually <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> vinyl and released with a proper picture sleeve.

He was never quite sure whether Mr. Heatherthwayte looked on the young lady as untainted, or whether he wished to secure her in his own instructions; but he always described her as a modest and virtuous young lady, and so far from thinking her presence dangerous, only wished Oil to learn as much from her as possible.|$|R

Not only was Chadwick correct in that they had been observing contamination, but they had overlooked yet another important discovery, that of nuclear fusion. Lawrence's response <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>on</b> with the creation of still larger cyclotrons. The 27-inch cyclotron was superseded by a 37-inch cyclotron in June 1937, which in turn was superseded by a 60-inch cyclotron in May 1939.

50|$|In the 1980s, Dragon's Lair (Cinematronics, June 1983), Cliff Hanger (Stern, December 1983) and Road Blaster (Data East, 1985) were {{interactive}} movie laserdisc {{video games}} that showed video clips stored on a laserdisc. This gave them graphics {{on par with}} an animated cartoon {{at a time when}} video games were composed of simple, pixelated characters, but left little room for more advanced gameplay elements. Gameplay consisted of watching an animated video and pressing the correct button every few seconds to avoid seeing a (circumstance-specific) loss scene and losing a life. Compared to modern titles, games like Dragon's Lair would require the player to memorize the proper sequence and timing of their input, effectively making the entire game one continuous QTE. Such uses were also seen as giving the player only the illusion of control, as outside of responding to QTE, there were no other commands the player could enter; effectively, these games were considered the equivalent of watching a movie and responding every few minutes to allow it to continue. An improvement to the QTE mechanic was flashing the buttons that need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> the screen, which appeared in the laserdisc games Super Don Quix-ote (Universal, 1984), Ninja Hayate (Taito, 1984), Time Gal (Taito, 1985) and Road Blaster.|$|E

The Company appealed to the North British Railway for assistance, which the NBR gave, and they agreed to extend the working arrangement too. The Anstruther and St Andrews Company also issued preference shares and managed to generate some more capital. This took some time, but in November 1885 a contract <b>was</b> awarded <b>to</b> James Young & Company for construction of the line on to St Andrews.|$|R

A song of theirs {{appeared}} on a 1985 Word Records compilation called The Buzz on the Streets. Their debut recording appeared in 1986 on Big Feet Records, followed by the 1987 release Sons of Liberty on What/Word. They began playing events in England soon after; {{by the end of}} the decade the group decided to move to England permanently. In 1991 they released View of a World, their first record <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> CD, on German label Pila Records. The full-length Boomerang followed in 1992 to critical acclaim in the Christian music press. The European Christian Booksellers' Journal named Boomerang Album of the Year in 1993. Their 1994 EP Call Me White Call Me Black was first recorded with the intent of selling during their Artists Against Racism tour in Germany, but was later tapped for general release. In 1995, the European Christian Booksellers' Journal gave Split Level its award for Best Christian Rock Band. Their next full-length, glo.bal, was released in both the UK and the U.S. in 1997 on the American label Organic Records. Their 2000 live release was recorded in Ennepetal, Germany at the Christmas Rock Night festival 1998.|$|E
50|$|The Gyromite {{retail package}} {{consists}} of the following items: two claws for R.O.B.'s hands; two gyros (heavy spinning tops); two red and blue trays upon which the gyros will rest, causing buttons <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> the second NES controller; one spinner motor for accelerating the gyros; and two black trays upon which the gyros are placed when not in use. Direct game mode is a feature used {{to learn how to}} use R.O.B. or to play with R.O.B. without playing the game. Gyromite is a puzzle-platformer in which the character has to collect dynamite before the time runs out, with several red and blue pillars blocking his way. In Game A, the commands are made by pressing START and then pushing the direction in which to move R.O.B., and using the A and B buttons to open and close his arms. If R.O.B. places a gyro on the red or blue button, it pushes the A or B button on the second NES controller, moving the pillar of the corresponding color. If both buttons need to be pressed at the same time, the gyros are placed in a spinner so that they will stay balanced on the button without R.O.B. holding it. Game B has the same controls, except that START does not need to be pressed to make R.O.B. accept a command.|$|E
