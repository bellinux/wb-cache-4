5|$|After her husband's death, Mary Shelley {{lived for}} a year with Leigh Hunt and his family in Genoa, where she often saw Byron and {{transcribed}} his poems. She resolved to live by her pen and for her son, but her financial situation was precarious. On 23 July 1823, she left Genoa for England and stayed with her father and stepmother in the Strand until a small advance from her father-in-law enabled her to lodge nearby. Sir Timothy Shelley had at first agreed to support his grandson, Percy Florence, only if he were handed over to an appointed guardian. Mary Shelley rejected this idea instantly. She managed instead to wring out of Sir Timothy a limited annual allowance (which she had to repay when Percy Florence inherited the estate), but {{to the end of}} his days he refused to meet her in person and dealt with her only through lawyers. Mary Shelley busied herself with editing her husband's poems, among other literary endeavours, but concern for her son restricted her options. Sir Timothy threatened to stop the allowance if any biography of the poet were published. In 1826, Percy Florence became the legal heir of the Shelley estate after the death of his half-brother Charles Shelley, his father's son by Harriet Shelley. Sir Timothy raised Mary's allowance from £100 a year to £250 but remained as difficult as ever. Mary Shelley enjoyed the stimulating society of William Godwin's circle, but poverty prevented her from socialising as she wished. She also felt ostracised by <b>those</b> <b>who,</b> <b>like</b> Sir Timothy, still disapproved of her relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley.|$|E

40|$|A {{sample of}} UK {{adolescents}} (n = 1140), grouped by sex and liking of science, evaluated themselves, and girl and boy targets who {{did or did}} not like science, on masculine, feminine and gender non-specific traits. Contrary to sociological concerns about the masculine image and appeal of science, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>liked</b> science more rated themselves more positively on feminine and gender non-specific but not masculine traits. The girl target was rated lower on feminine traits if she liked science, but the boy was rated higher on feminine traits if he liked science. Target ratings also showed in-group enhancement based on liking of science, and a 'black sheep' effect: <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>liked</b> science less discriminated against the same-sex target <b>who</b> <b>liked</b> science, especially on gender in-group relevant traits. We argue that gender differences in science education should be attributed partly to subjective group dynamics and not solely to images of science...|$|R

25|$|The first {{historic}} mission documents — primarily baptism, marriage, {{and death}} records — name {{the city with}} the names as 'La Tía Juana', 'Tiguana', 'Tiuana', 'Teguana', 'Tiwana', 'Tijuan', 'Ticuan', and the present day name, 'Tijuana'. The commonly accepted theory among historians is that the modern-day Tijuana is derived from a word belong to the Kumeyaay language – the original aboriginal inhabitants of the San Diego-Tijuana region. Tijuana derives from the Kumeyaay word Tiwan, meaning by-the-sea. Common in regional folklore, a myth exists purporting that the name is a conjunction of Tia Juana, the Spanish-language version of Aunt Jane. Tia Juana would provide food and a resting place to travelers on their journeys. The story has become a popular myth with residents {{of the city and}} has particular resonance among <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>like</b> to imagine the city as a place of hospitality.|$|E
25|$|Gamay Beaujolais is a Californian misnomer for a UCD clone {{series of}} upright-growing ('Pinot droit') Pinot noir. Planted mostly in California it also became {{established}} in New Zealand. In this latter country, its disposition to poor fruit set in cool flowering conditions can be problematic. Claims that the 'Gamay Beaujolais' Pinot noir {{was brought to}} California by Paul Masson. are not correct. It was collected in France by Harold Olmo for UCD in the 1950s {{and was one of}} the first Pinot noir vines this institution offered as a high health clonal line from about 1962 onward. However, it was misleadingly identified at UCD as a 'Gamay Beaujolais' type (of Pinot noir). In general, these upright growing 'Pinot droit' clones are highly productive (in suitable, hot-to-warm, flowering conditions) and in California and New Zealand they give robust, burly, wines favored by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>like</b> muscle rather than charm and velvety finesse in their Pinot noir wines. In Burgundy, the use of (highly productive) Pinot droit clones is reportedly still widespread in inferior, Village appellation, or even non-appellation, vineyards and Pinot droit is consequently regarded, arguably with very good reason, as a (genetic) sub-form significantly inferior to classical, decumbent, 'Pinot fine' or 'Pinot tordu', clonal lines of Pinot.|$|E

Indeed, Debussy {{was one of}} many composers, {{including}} Tchaikovsky, who felt the need to break with Wagner precisely because his influence was so unmistakable and overwhelming. [...] "Golliwogg's Cakewalk" [...] from Debussy's Children's Corner piano suite contains a deliberately tongue-in-cheek quotation from the opening bars of Tristan. Others who proved resistant to Wagner's operas included Gioachino Rossini, who said [...] "Wagner has wonderful moments, and dreadful quarters of an hour." [...] In the 20th century Wagner's music was parodied by Paul Hindemith and Hanns Eisler, among others.|$|E

The introduction by Giora Amir describes as [...] "a bunch of mockers, pseudo-historians and historians" [...] <b>those</b> <b>who,</b> <b>like</b> Vrba, argue that the Slovak Jewish Council may have collaborated with the Nazis by concealing what was happening in Auschwitz.

500|$|John Keats (The New York Times Book Review) {{described}} Compulsory Miseducation as [...] "passionate" [...] and [...] "eloquent". He called Goodman's propositions in {{the absence}} of formal schooling [...] "startling" [...] and characterized Goodman as [...] "a lonely humanist crying in a Philistine marketplace, where the largest single share of public wealth is devoted to the strategies of overkill, and where another enormous amount is dedicated to putting blinders on the probable victims." [...] Keats recommended the book for parents who put their children's welfare before their own. Eli M. Oboler (Library Journal), meanwhile, only recommended Goodman's [...] "polemic onslaught" [...] for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>like</b> [...] "contentious [...] disagreeable" [...] material.

500|$|Portrait of Madame Cézanne was {{exhibited}} {{along with}} {{works such as}} Man with Folded Arms at Lichtentein's first Pop exhibition in Los Angeles. The linear twice-removed black-and-white (along with Man with Folded Arms) {{is regarded as a}} quotation of Erle Loran's outline diagram of Cézanne's compositional methods published in a diagram book called Cézanne's Composition. The book was popular in the academic community. Loran's representation in a [...] "harsh black outline" [...] depicted the axes of the composition without representing the [...] "texture and expressiveness of Cézanne's original." [...] In fact, Loran stated that [...] "this diagrammatic approach may seem coldly analytical to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>like</b> vagueness and poetry in art criticism." [...] Loran's diagrammatic techniques were standard at the time; redrawn outlines of the figure were illustrated with alphabetized arrows to identify areas and directions. The diagram highlighted body part positioning without studying the painted surface.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian and The Independent {{have each}} {{released}} two separate reviews; {{they were more}} mixed. Sam Wollaston enjoyed the first two episodes, but called it a [...] "pathetic male fantasy." [...] Andrew Anthony has said that [...] "no scene lasted more than about 25 seconds {{in the first two}} episodes and no element of plot information was left unspoken. The dialogue is close to pure exposition, with an occasional clunkily macho line thrown in as a concession to dramatic atmosphere. Show, don't tell, say the screenwriting gurus. This was show and tell." [...] From The Independent, Tom Sutcliffe stated the series may be enjoyed by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>like</b> explosions and Spooks-like operations. Rhiannon Harries was almost negative in her review, believing Strike Back was [...] "in almost every respect, a terrible piece of television drama," [...] although part of Harries enjoyed watching it.

The influential editor Rufus Wilmot Griswold, who believed she went against his notion of feminine modesty, referred to Woman in the Nineteenth Century as [...] "an eloquent expression of her discontent at having been created female". New York writer Charles Frederick Briggs said that she was [...] "wasting the time of her readers", especially because she was an unmarried woman and therefore could not [...] "truly represent the female character". English writer and critic Matthew Arnold scoffed at Fuller's conversations as well, saying, [...] "My G–d, what rot did she and the other female dogs of Boston talk about Greek mythology!"
