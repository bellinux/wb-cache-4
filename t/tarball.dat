25|$|A <b>tarball</b> is a blob {{of crude}} oil (not to be {{confused}} with tar, which is a man-made product derived from pine trees or refined from petroleum) which has been weathered after floating in the ocean. Tarballs are an aquatic pollutant in most environments, although they can occur naturally, for example in the Santa Barbara Channel of California or in the Gulf of Mexico off Texas. Their concentration and features have been used to assess the extent of oil spills. Their composition can be used to identify their sources of origin, and tarballs themselves may be dispersed over long distances by deep sea currents. They are slowly decomposed by bacteria, including Chromobacterium violaceum, Cladosporium resinae, Bacillus submarinus, Micrococcus varians, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida marina and Saccharomyces estuari.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tarballs</b> may be {{dispersed}} {{over long}} distances by deep sea currents. The density of <b>tarballs</b> {{depends on the}} solids {{picked up in the}} weathering process. They can range in density with some being more dense than seawater, which, at 1.025 g/ml, is more dense than the density of fresh water. When the <b>tarballs</b> are less dense than seawater, they can travel over great distances.|$|R

Oil pollution {{is considered to be}} one of the main contributors to marine pollution. Besides that, the threat that oil pollution poses to the marine environment is extremely dangerous to its ecosystem. The South China Sea is one of the important route for several activities such as fisheries, recreational and marine and also oil and gas exploration. Batu Burok beach in Kuala Terengganu which located facing the South China Sea also poses the same oil pollution which is <b>tarballs.</b> The <b>tarballs</b> which stranded on Batu Burok beach are further analyzed by using EDXRF spectrometry as to investigate the distribution of heavy metals in it and to determine the relationship of the heavy metals concentration with standards parameter. Besides that, Kuala Terengganu consists of four lithologies which are metasiltstone, shale, siltstone and tuff as for the geological finding and geological map with the scale of 1 : 25, 000 of Kuala Terengganu is then updated. There are 10 distribution of heavy metals that found In <b>tarballs</b> which are aluminium (Al), potassium (K), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), barium (Ba), zirconium (Zr), antimony (Sb), titanium (Ti), tin (Sn) and manganese(Mn). Among all the distribution of heavy metals that found in <b>tarballs,</b> only Ba and Mn are the common heavy metals which found in <b>tarballs</b> and also classified as poisonous or carcinogen to human and environment. Based on the concentration comparison of Ba and Mn with standards parameter provided by ACGIH(IDLH) and NIOSH(IDLH), the <b>tarballs</b> which stranded on Batu Burok beach are not poisonous as the concentration of Ba and Mn does not exceeds the standards limit which not give effect on human health and environment. ...|$|R
2500|$|According to the Sea Turtle Conservancy, {{formerly}} known as the Caribbean Conservation Program, the migration habits of sea turtles increase their exposure to marine pollution at each of the stages of their lives including eggs, hatchlings, juveniles, sub adults, or nesting adults. [...] A 1994 study off of Florida’s Atlantic coast, 63% of hatchlings surveyed had been found to have ingested tar. [...] Loggerheads in particular have been shown to have the most problems with <b>tarball</b> ingestion, leading to esophageal swelling that can dislocate the intestines and liver leading to serious buoyancy issues as well as excessive swelling. Many regions heavily associated with oil, either exploration, transportation, or processing, are also significant sea turtle environments, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, and particularly the coasts of Texas and Florida. Sea turtles existing in the exact areas where oil spills occur {{are not the only ones}} at risk due to the strong and far reaching ocean currents which can move pollution to great distances from its derivation.|$|E
