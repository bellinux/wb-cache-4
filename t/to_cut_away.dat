5|$|As Généreux {{pulled away}} to the west, Thompson, who had already been wounded several times, succeeded in turning his {{battered}} ship so that his broadside was directed at the stern of Généreux. Despite the collapsed wreckage of the mizzenmast and fore topmast, his gunnery teams managed <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>away</b> enough of the obstruction to fire a raking broadside at the French vessel. Although Leander had inflicted severe damage, the size {{and power of the}} French ship was beginning to tell, and Lejoille was able to turn Généreux southwards again. The ships continued exchanging broadsides until 15:30, by which time Leanders crew had run out of regular shot and were firing scrap metal at the French ship. Eventually Lejoille succeeded in bringing Généreux across Leanders bow and hailed the British ship, asking if they had surrendered. Unable to continue fighting due to the wreckage that lay across the forward guns, Thompson ordered a French flag raised on a pike, which was sufficient for Lejoille to cease firing.|$|E

25|$|The {{circumcision}} {{consists of}} three procedures, the first being the cutting of the foreskin. The second is the priah, or peeling back of the epithelium after the foreskin has been amputated. According to Shaye J. D. Cohen, in Why Aren't Jewish Women Circumcised?: Gender and Covenant in Judaism, pg 25, the Torah only commands circumcision (milah). David Gollaher has written that the rabbis added the procedure of periah to discourage men from trying to restore their foreskins: ‘Once established, periah was deemed essential to circumcision; if the mohel failed <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>away</b> enough tissue, the operation was deemed insufficient to comply with God's covenant’ and ‘Depending on the strictness of individual rabbis, boys (or men {{thought to have been}} inadequately cut) were subjected to additional operations.’ In addition to milah (the actual circumcision) and priah, mentioned above, the Talmud mentions a third step, metzitzah, or squeezing some blood from the wound.|$|E

Their defense then forced a punt, which Mike Fuller returned 28 yards to the Raiders 41-yard line. From there, San Diego took the ball {{all the way to the}} end zone, scoring on a 7-play drive that ended on Chuck Muncie's 6-yard touchdown run, cutting the deficit to 28–24. Oakland responded with a 68-yard drive, including a 22-yard completion from Plunkett to King, leading to Chris Bahr's 27-yard field goal to retake their 7-point lead. Then after a three and out, Matthews returned Partridge's next punt six yards to the Oakland 49, where the Raiders added a 33-yard field goal from Bahr to increase their lead to 34–24 with 9:46 left in the game.|$|E

25|$|In April 1808 Nymphe was {{cruising}} off Lisbon, {{in company}} with the 18-gun sloop , Commander George Pigot, when Captain Shipley learned that the 20-gun brig Gaivota was lying by Belém Castle, making ready to sail. At 21:00 {{on the evening of}} 23 April a force of eight boats with 150 officers and men from Nymphe and Blossom set out to capture her. Unfortunately, a strong ebb tide fed by heavy rains set in, slowing their approach and it was not until 02:30 that the boats of Nymphe reached the brig. Captain Shipley led the boarders, climbing the fore-rigging and attempting <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>away</b> the boarding-netting, but he was shot and fell into the river. His brother, Charles Shipley, serving as a volunteer, immediately ordered the gig to pick him up, but the boats fell afoul of each other and became entangled with a caulking stage moored astern. Having lost the element of surprise, and with the boats of Blossom failing to reach the brig, the enterprise was abandoned. As well as her captain, Nymphe lost a seaman, and one marine was wounded. Captain Shipley's body was later recovered and it was evident that he had been killed instantly by a musket ball through the forehead. Commander Pigot was appointed by Admiral Sir Charles Cotton, the commander-in-chief on the coast of Portugal, to be Captain Shipley's successor on board Nymphe; and on 17 September he was confirmed in his post-rank. Captain The Hon. Josceline Percy, was later appointed to command her, while operating off coast of Spain.|$|E
