5|$|The {{family moved}} to Berlin in 1811, leaving Hamburg in {{disguise}} fearing French revenge for the Mendelssohn bank's role in breaking Napoleon's Continental System blockade. Abraham and Lea Mendelssohn sought to give their children– Fanny, Felix, Paul and Rebecka– <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>education</b> possible. Fanny became a well-known pianist and amateur composer; originally Abraham had thought that she, rather than Felix, would be the more musical. But at that time, it was not considered proper, by either Abraham or Felix, {{for a woman to}} have a career in music, so Fanny remained an active but non-professional musician. Abraham was also disinclined to allow Felix to follow a musical career until it became clear that he seriously intended to dedicate himself to it.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} greater {{emphasis}} was laid upon {{the civil service}} system of recruiting officials; this was based upon degrees acquired through competitive examinations, {{in an effort to}} select the most capable individuals for governance. Selecting men for office through proven merit was an ancient idea in China. The civil service system became institutionalized on a small scale during the Sui and Tang dynasties, but by the Song period it became virtually the only means for drafting officials into the government. The advent of widespread printing helped to widely circulate Confucian teachings and to educate more and more eligible candidates for the exams. This {{can be seen in the}} number of exam takers for the low-level prefectural exams rising from 30,000 annual candidates in the early 11th century to 400,000 candidates by the late 13th century. The civil service and examination system allowed for greater meritocracy, social mobility, and equality in competition for those wishing to attain an official seat in government. Using statistics gathered by the Song state, Edward A. Kracke, Sudō Yoshiyuki, and Ho Ping-ti supported the hypothesis that simply having a father, grandfather, or great-grandfather who had served as an official of state did not guarantee one would obtain the same level of authority. Robert Hartwell and Robert P. Hymes criticized this model, stating that it places too much emphasis on the role of the nuclear family and considers only three paternal ascendants of exam candidates while ignoring the demographic reality of Song China, the significant proportion of males in each generation that had no surviving sons, and the role of the extended family. Many felt disenfranchised by what they saw as a bureaucratic system that favored the land-holding class able to afford <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>education.</b> One of the greatest literary critics of this was the official and famous poet Su Shi. Yet Su was a product of his times, as the identity, habits, and attitudes of the scholar-official had become less aristocratic and more bureaucratic with the transition of the periods from Tang to Song. At the beginning of the dynasty, government posts were disproportionately held by two elite social groups: a founding elite who had ties with the founding emperor and a semi-hereditary professional elite who used long-held clan status, family connections, and marriage alliances to secure appointments. By the late 11th century, the founding elite became obsolete, while political partisanship and factionalism at court undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which dissolved as a distinguishable social group and was replaced by a multitude of gentry families.|$|E

Further, Roche was present (and probably directly involved) when his associates attacked and killed a watchman. Compelled to leave Dublin, Roche made his way to Cork, and from there to North America.

25|$|Charles Vincente Domingo was a Kunda born around 1875 in {{the lower}} Shire River valley in Mozambique. As a young child, he lived in Quelimane with his father, who was {{employed}} there as a cook by the African Lakes Company. He was found in Quelimane in 1881, apparently after his father’s death, by the South African Presbyterian evangelist, William Koyi, who {{was attached to the}} Livingstonia mission and was returning there from South Africa. Koyi took the boy to the mission and acted as guardian until his death in 1884. Domingo then became a household servant of Dr Robert Laws at Livingstonia, studying in its school and being baptised into the Free Church of Scotland. Through Laws’ efforts, Domingo secured <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>education</b> then available in Central Africa, including travelling with Laws to the Lovedale Missionary Institute in South Africa between 1891 and 1894. On his return to Livingstonia, he studied to become a teacher, after which he became the first African teaching assistant in the Livingstonia mission school in 1897. This was followed by further theological studies at the Overtoun Institute in Livingstonia from 1900 to 1902, and he was licenced as a preacher in 1903, serving as preacher and schoolmaster for the next six years.|$|E

The Spanish government provided {{for a separate}} class of free people of color, and encouraged slaves to purchase their freedom.

John Maxwell, the fourth child, was born in 1824 when Kingsley and Anna lived on Fort George Island. Kingsley also maintained relationships with three other African women who acted as co-wives or concubines: Flora H., Sarah M.; and Munsilna McGundo. Anna Jai remained the matriarch in the polygamous family. Historian Daniel Schafer posits that Anna Jai would have been familiar with the concepts of polygamy and marrying a slave master to acquire one's freedom. [...] Visitors to the plantation were invited to a dinner table where Kingsley displayed his multi-racial children with pride.
