40|$|PURPOSE: The {{technical}} note herein presents an approach for estimating the suspended-sediment source from cutterhead, hopper, and clamshell dredges. The approach involves modifica-tion {{of an existing}} method developed from limited field data. These estimates are needed to provide input to a numerical model called SSFATE (Suspended Sediment FATE) that is being developed under the Dredging Operations and Environmental Research (DOER) Program. BACKGROUND: A need exists for numerical modeling tools <b>to</b> address questions <b>related</b> <b>to</b> environmental <b>windows</b> associated with dredging projects. One such question <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> where and in what quantity suspended sediment from dredging operations {{moves away from the}} dredging location. With this information, decision makers would be aided in determining reasonable start and end dates for environmental <b>windows</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> fish migratory pathways, sedimentation on sensitive benthic habitats, and other environmental issues. The SSFATE model is being developed under DOER to provide field offices with such a tool. The basic computations are based on a particle-tracking approach with each particle representing a certain amount of sediment mass that is generated at the location of the dredging operation. These particles are then diffused and transported throughout the water body of interest while undergoing settling. Suspended-sedimen...|$|R
30|$|Pulse-shaped OFDM {{is closely}} <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>windowed</b> OFDM and {{filtered}} multitone (FMT) [6]. It exploits the pulse shape {{as an additional}} degree of freedom for multicarrier modulation systems. The principle of OFDM with pulse shaping has been introduced in [13]. One of the main criteria for pulse shape design is the time-frequency localization (TFL), which has been identified in [14] as an important target to achieve low out-of-band emissions and low interference induced in doubly dispersive channels. Furthermore, [15 – 17] investigated the pulse shape optimization framework considering realistic channel knowledge. However, these resulting pulse shapes usually span over several successive symbols, rendering them not well suited for selected scenarios like short-block low-latency transmission or fast time division duplex (TDD) uplink-downlink switching. To address this practical issue, [18, 19] proposed some analytic solutions {{for the design of}} short pulse shapes for specific settings.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Clouds {{are complex}} systems subject to an {{increasing}} number of anomalies and threats. In this paper we briefly revisit the issues <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>Windows</b> guest cloud service resilience and later provide some preliminary results on the resilience of Windows cloud guests via virtualization. In particular, we propose an architecture, Cloud Resilience for Windows (CReW). CReW can transparently monitor guest Windows VMs and can also react to both security breaches and system integrity violation, improving the dependability of cloudified Windows systems. CReW can also improve resilience from software misconfiguration by restoring the guest latest safe state. Effectiveness and performance of a CReW prototype have been evaluated; obtained results show the feasibility of such a system.

40|$|In a {{conventional}} numerical scheme, the computational domain is truncated {{from a large}} physical system, leaving the inflow/outflow boundary conditions difficult to specify. In this study, a "spatial window function" is introduced to truncate the computational domain from the physical domain in the streamwise direction. The standard compressible Navier-Stokes equations are transformed into a set of equations with periodicity in this direction. Fourier spectral methods then {{can be used in}} the streamwise direction to solve this set of equationsefficiently. No numerical inflow/outflow boundary conditions are needed. Theories regarding the convergence property of this new scheme and design principles for the window function are developed. The accuracy of the scheme is shown <b>to</b> be mainly <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the <b>window</b> function. By properly designing the window function, spectral accuracy can be obtained. Issues concerning the numerical implementation of this scheme are also discussed...|$|R
