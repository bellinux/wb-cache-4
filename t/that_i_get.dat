In a 1982 interview with Down Beat magazine Frith said that so much more {{can be done with}} tape: [...] "I'm interested in using the studio for things that you couldn't possibly do in a performance, to use the medium of tape {{in a way that is}} intrinsic to it." [...] He added that hardware malfunctions often result in more interesting sounds than was originally intended: [...] " [...] lot of the sounds <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> in the studio have been specifically the result of overloading or causing to malfunction various pieces of technology, like harmonizers or digital delays." ...|$|E

In an interview with Digital Spy, Shearsmith said that this surprised him, saying [...] "I was upset, I did {{think it was a}} shame that it's not been recognised. You want people to have seen it and to have recognised the work, and innovation, but I think people are doing <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> told that every day on Twitter, or in meetings." [...] A number of journalists expressed surprise that Inside No. 9 had received no BAFTA nominations, with Julia Raeside, of The Guardian, describing [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] as [...] "one of the most inspired pieces of mute theatre I've seen on television".|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Lundgren {{starred in}} Craig R. Baxley's sci-fi thriller I Come in Peace (also known as Dark Angel) {{opposite}} Brian Benben, Betsy Brantley, Matthias Hues and Jay Bilas. Lundgren plays Jack Caine, a tough Houston cop with an inner sensitivity, {{who does not}} let the rules of police procedure prevent him pursuing his mission {{to wipe out the}} White Boys, a gang of white collar drug dealers who killed his partner while he was waylaid stopping a convenience store robbery. Lundgren said of his role, [...] "What attracted me to Dark Angel is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> {{to do more than just}} action. There's some romance, some comedy, some drama. I actually have some clever dialogue in this one. I get to act. One author said [...] "Universe (1987) or Dark Angel (1990), demonstrates that nature and his [...] hairdresser have suited him perfectly to Nazi genetically engineered baddie roles." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{previous}} single from X, [...] "Talk", was {{a tribute}} to the German band Kraftwerk; similarly, [...] "The Hardest Part" [...] was intended by Coldplay to acknowledge American band R.E.M. When asked why the song paid {{a tribute to}} R.E.M.'s lead singer, Michael Stipe, Chris Martin said: [...] "I've lost all respect for fame, but I haven't lost all respect for respect. So the one great thing about being famous is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to meet people who I respect. Our relationship is akin to a dog and its master. I'll always look up to him." [...] The band felt the track resembled R.E.M.'s 1991 single, [...] "Losing My Religion". [...] "The Hardest Part" [...] was left out of the album track list when the band sent an early version of X to their record label, Parlophone, but was included when the album was finalised.|$|E

She states of this: [...] "Shakespeare keeps coming my way. I love the fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to play people who are much more articulate than I'll ever be". Ayola has performed in Twelfth Night in the lead roles of both Olivia and Viola. She explains: [...] "The role of Viola didn't sit that well with me for some reason but Olivia makes more sense." [...] She has also appeared in modern performances, assuming the title role of Dido, Queen of Carthage at the Globe Theatre in London in 2003, which she described as [...] "a dream of a part". She has deemed her dream role to be that of Isabella in Measure for Measure, as she once lost out on the part and would like to prove herself capable of playing it.|$|E

Director Josh Boone said: [...] "We read close to 150 actresses for the role, and I saw about 50 of those. Within ten or fifteen seconds of Shailene's audition, I knew she was Hazel. She held up her script pages and just her eyes were peeking over them." [...] On May 10, 2013, Ansel Elgort was cast as Hazel's love interest, Augustus Waters. On July 23, Laura Dern joined the cast as Hazel's mother Frannie Lancaster, and Nat Wolff as Issac, Augustus' best friend. Wolff told HuffPost Live: [...] "It's exciting, I feel really lucky.

At the 60th Academy Awards, Empire of the Sun was nominated for Art Direction, Cinematography, Editing, Original Music Score, Costume Design (Bob Ringwood), and Sound (Robert Knudson, Don Digirolamo, John Boyd and Tony Dawe). It did not convert any of the nominations into awards. Allen Daviau, who was nominated as cinematographer, publicly complained, [...] "I can't second-guess the Academy, but I feel very sorry <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> nominations and Steven doesn't. It's his vision that makes it all come together, and if Steven wasn't making these films, {{none of us would}} be here." [...] The film won awards for cinematography, sound design, and music score at the 42nd British Academy Film Awards. The nominations included production design, costume design, and adapted screenplay.

2500|$|The {{site was}} never {{intended}} to be a money-maker or a career option for Brazelton, [...] "It's a coincidence <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> money and keep the site self-supporting." [...] To support the comic, Brazelton initially asked visitors for a US$1 donation, which was very unproductive. [...] He was more successful when he began selling t-shirts and posters featuring his comic, but it was still insufficient to cover Theater Hoppers costs. [...] By 2006, the site was utilizing advertising networks to sell ad space. [...] Though he was dissatisfied with the aesthetic integration of advertising with his site design, the income (initially $500 a month) did begin to cover all of Brazelton's varied associated costs. Revenue from Theater Hopper is insufficient for Brazelton to not work a full-time job, and he does not foresee that changing. As of August 2007, the ratio of advertising to merchandising income from Theater Hopper was 70 to 30%, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|When Rob Liefeld, one of Image's co-founders, {{split from}} the {{publisher}} and formed his own company Awesome Entertainment, he hired Moore {{to create a new}} universe for the characters he had brought with him from Image. Moore's [...] "solution was breathtaking and cocky – he created a long and distinguished history for these new characters, retro-fitting a fake silver and gold age for them." [...] Moore began writing comics for many of these characters, such as Glory and Youngblood, as well as a three-part mini-series known as Judgment Day to provide a basis for the Awesome Universe. Moore was not satisfied with Liefeld, saying [...] "I just got fed up with the unreliability of information <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> from him, that I didn't trust him. I didn't think that he was respecting the work and I found it hard to respect him.

Not everyone is confident enough to face the world, and not everyone lives in a safe environment."

[...] Sosnovska did, however, see the decision to be out as a personal choice. [...] "I don’t blame people who choose not be out," [...] she said. She donated her time to fan sponsored fundraisers that raised money for several charities connected to the Lena and Bianca storylines. Over $20,000 had been raised for the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project. Sosnovska stated, [...] "I would never have known what a powerful tool TV could be, especially daytime. It’s frightening to the extent it’s a huge responsibility on the producers, directors, and actors to influence minds. You can’t underestimate the force of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Sadoveanu's {{stories of}} the period often {{returned}} to a naturalistic perspective, particularly {{in a series of}} sketch stories and novellas which portray the modest lives of Romanian Railways employees, of young men drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, of Bovaryist women who playfully seduce adolescents, or of the provincial petite bourgeoisie. At times, they confront the morals of barely literate people with the stern authorities: a peasant obstinately believes that the 1859 union between Wallachia and Moldavia was meant to ensure the supremacy of his class; a young lower-class woman becomes the love interest of a boyar but chooses a life of freedom; and a Rom deserts from the Army after being told to bathe. In La noi, la Viișoara ("At Our Place in Viișoara"), the life of an old man degenerates into bigotry and avarice, {{to the point where he}} makes his wife starve to death. Sadoveanu's positive portrayal of hajduks as fundamentally honest outlaws standing up to feudal injustice, replicates stereotypes found in Romanian folklore, and is mostly present in some of the stories through (sometimes recurrent) heroic characters: Vasile the Great, Cozma Răcoare, Liță Florea etc. In the piece titled Bordeenii (roughly, [...] "The Mud-hut Dwellers"), he shows eccentrics and misanthropes presided upon by the dark figure of Sandu Faliboga, brigands who flee all public authority and whom commentators have likened to settlers of the Americas. Lepădatu, an unwanted child, speaks for the entire group: [...] "What could I do [...] wherever there are big fairs and lots of people? I'd have a better time with the cattle; it is with them that I have grown up and with them <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> along." [...] Romanticizing the obscure events of early medieval history in Vremuri de bejenie ("Roving Times", 1907), Sadoveanu sketches the improvised self-defense of a refugee community, their last stand against nomadic Tatars.|$|E
