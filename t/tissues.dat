5|$|RNAi in vivo {{delivery}} to <b>tissues</b> still eludes scienceâ€”especially to <b>tissues</b> {{deep within the}} body. RNAi delivery is only easily accessible to surface <b>tissues</b> such as the eye and respiratory tract. In these instances, siRNA {{has been used in}} direct contact with the tissue for transport. The resulting RNAi successfully focused on target genes. When delivering siRNA to deep <b>tissues,</b> the siRNA must be protected from nucleases, but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty. This difficulty has been combatted with high dosage levels of siRNA to ensure the <b>tissues</b> have been reached, however in these cases hepatotoxicity was reported.|$|E
5|$|Submarine escape {{training}} led US Navy {{personnel to}} believe that Haldane's allowable supersaturation ratios for fast <b>tissues</b> were unnecessarily conservative, as calculated values indicated that supersaturation in trainees exceeded Haldane's limits, {{but they did not}} develop DCS. A large number (2143) of experimental dives were conducted over 3 years to derive allowable supersaturation ratios for a Haldanian 5 compartment model with compartment half-times of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 minutes. Values for critical supersaturation derived from this experimental work were different for each tissue compartment. Values for slow <b>tissues</b> (75 and 40-minute) were close to Haldane's findings, but considerably higher values were found for the fast <b>tissues.</b> These values were so high that the researchers concluded that the 5- and 10-minute <b>tissues</b> were not relevant to the development of DCS. Based on these conclusions, a set of tables was computed which omitted the 5- and 10-minute <b>tissues.</b>|$|E

40|$|WO 2010130305 A 1 UPAB: 20101203 NOVELTY - Method for {{separating}} first <b>tissue</b> layer from multilayered biological <b>tissue</b> cluster, {{consisting of}} first <b>tissue</b> layer {{and at least}} one other <b>tissue</b> layer connected to first <b>tissue</b> layer. The first <b>tissue</b> layer is brittle compared to other <b>tissue</b> layer and the other <b>tissue</b> layer is tougher compared to first <b>tissue</b> layer. The brittle fracture is triggered in the first <b>tissue</b> layer by applying one or more sudden force pulses to <b>tissue</b> cluster and allowing first <b>tissue</b> layer which is split open as a result to be detached from the other <b>tissue</b> layer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following: (1) device for destroying the integrity of first cell layer in piece of <b>tissue</b> of <b>tissue</b> cluster; and (2) arrangement for automatic isolation of epithelial cells from <b>tissue</b> cluster. USE - The method is useful for separating first <b>tissue</b> layer from multilayered biological <b>tissue</b> of the animal or human skin <b>tissue,</b> preferably epithelial cells and isolating cells chosen from keratinocytes and fibroblast cells from <b>tissue</b> (claimed) of skin biopsy, where the isolated cells are used in research for constructing three-dimensional <b>tissue</b> structures and skin models.

50|$|<b>Tissue</b> {{fixation}} {{is performed}} by chemical fixation using formalin.

5|$|Any dive {{which is}} started while the <b>tissues</b> retain {{residual}} inert gas {{in excess of}} the surface equilibrium condition is considered a repetitive dive. This means that the decompression required for the dive is influenced by the divers decompression history. Allowance must be made for inert gas preloading of the <b>tissues</b> which will result in them containing more dissolved gas than would have been the case if the diver had fully equilibrated before the dive. The diver will need to decompress longer to eliminate this increased gas loading.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles {{of the brain and}} contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or soft <b>tissues</b> around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the soft <b>tissues</b> around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are phagocytes in <b>tissues</b> {{that are}} {{in contact with the}} {{external}} environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines.

Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily <b>tissues</b> and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.|$|E

5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} <b>tissues,</b> there is a tendency for gas to return from the <b>tissues</b> to the breathing gas.

This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E

50|$|In biology, adipose <b>tissue</b> , body fat, {{or simply}} fat is a loose {{connective}} <b>tissue</b> composed mostly of adipocytes. In addition to adipocytes, adipose <b>tissue</b> contains the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of cells including preadipocytes, fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells {{and a variety}} of immune cells such as adipose <b>tissue</b> macrophages. Adipose <b>tissue</b> is derived from preadipocytes. Its main role is to store energy in the form of lipids, although it also cushions and insulates the body. Far from being hormonally inert, adipose <b>tissue</b> has, in recent years, been recognized as a major endocrine organ, as it produces hormones such as leptin, estrogen, resistin, and the cytokine TNFÎ±. The two types of adipose <b>tissue</b> are white adipose <b>tissue</b> (WAT), which stores energy, and brown adipose <b>tissue</b> (BAT), which generates body heat.

5|$|Once all {{the tissue}} {{compartments}} have reached saturation {{for a given}} pressure and breathing mixture, continued exposure will not increase the gas loading of the <b>tissues.</b> From this point onwards the required decompression remains the same. If divers work and live at pressure for a long period, and are decompressed {{only at the end}} of the period, the risks associated with decompression are limited to this single exposure. This principle has led to the practice of saturation diving, and as there is only one decompression, and it is done in the relative safety and comfort of a saturation habitat, the decompression is done on a very conservative profile, minimising the risk of bubble formation, growth and the consequent injury to <b>tissues.</b> A consequence of these procedures is that saturation divers are more likely to suffer decompression sickness symptoms in the slowest <b>tissues,</b> whereas bounce divers are more likely to develop bubbles in faster <b>tissues.</b>|$|E
