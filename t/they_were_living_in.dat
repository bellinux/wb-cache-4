25|$|An additional, rabbinic prohibition, which Jewish {{religious}} tradition ascribes {{to the court}} of King Solomon, forbids carrying in any area that was shared by the occupants of more than one dwelling, even if it is surrounded by fences or walls.

By means of this shared meal, all the dwellers are considered as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> a common dwelling, thus exempting them from the added prohibition.|$|E

25|$|During his {{original}} trial, Reynolds had challenged two jurors, {{both of whom}} stated that they had formed an opinion on the guilt or innocence of Reynolds before the trial. The court held that universal education and press reports {{made it hard to}} find jurors who had not formed some opinion. It found that Reynolds had failed to meet the requirement that he, as challenger of a juror's objectivity, demonstrate that a juror had developed a real and strong opinion. The prosecution had discharged two potential jurors who refused to say whether or not <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> polygamy. The Court held that it would not overturn a case based on the legality of challenges to dismissed jurors.|$|E

In December 1981, Raised Dot Computing released its first major product, BRAILLE-EDIT, a word processor and two-way Braille translator program for the Apple II. Navy left the university in 1984 to work for the company, and the couple and the company moved back to Madison, Wisconsin in July 1984.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} two decades after the 1948 war ended, between 700,000 and 900,000 Jews fled or were {{expelled}} from the Arab countries <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in,</b> in many cases owing to anti-Jewish sentiment, expulsion (in the case of Egypt), or, in the case of Iraq, legal oppression but also quite often to promises of a better life from Israel; of this number, two-thirds ended up in refugee camps in Israel, while the remainder migrated to France, the United States and other Western or Latin American countries. The Jewish refugee camps in Israel were evacuated with time and the refugees were eventually integrated in the Jewish Israeli society (which in fact consisted almost entirely of refugees from Arab and European states). Israel argued that this and the Palestinian exodus represented a population exchange between Arab nations and the Jewish nation.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{of growth}} in wealth can be seen with the {{appearance}} of stone buildings around the 13th century AD, before which all of the buildings were wattle-and-daub. The socio-economic status of the individuals residing there could be clearly seen in the type of structure <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in.</b> Among Kilwa's exports were spices, tortoise shell, coconut oil, ivory, and aromatic gums, as well as gold and slaves. At around this time, Kilwa had seized control over the trade of gold at Sofala. The wealthy also possessed more commercial goods than the individuals who were of lower class did. Luxury cloths and foreign ceramics were among a few of the items they would have owned, though some items, such as luxury cloths, do not preserve in the archaeological record. For approximately 500 years, Kilwa was minting coins. This lasted from about A.D 1100-1600 and the coins have been found across the region, including Great Zimbabwe.|$|E
25|$|Pentecostalism {{emerged in}} the early 20th century among radical adherents of the Holiness {{movement}} who were energized by revivalism and expectation for the imminent Second Coming of Christ. Believing that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the end times, they expected God to spiritually renew the Christian Church thereby bringing to pass the restoration of spiritual gifts and the evangelization of the world. In 1900, Charles Parham, an American evangelist and faith healer, began teaching that speaking in tongues was the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism. The three-year-long Azusa Street Revival, founded and led by William J. Seymour in Los Angeles, California, resulted in the spread of Pentecostalism throughout the United States {{and the rest of}} the world as visitors carried the Pentecostal experience back to their home churches or felt called to the mission field. While virtually all Pentecostal denominations trace their origins to Azusa Street, the movement has experienced a variety of divisions and controversies. An early dispute centered on challenges to the doctrine of the Trinity. As a result, the Pentecostal movement is divided between trinitarian and non-trinitarian branches, resulting in the emergence of Oneness Pentecostals.|$|E
