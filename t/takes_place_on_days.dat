50|$|Mating flights {{between the}} winged queen and winged drones usually occur between the late mornings to midafternoons. This {{typically}} <b>takes</b> <b>place</b> <b>on</b> <b>days</b> following {{a rainy day}} or night. The mating ritual {{is similar to that}} of the average fire ants: the queens only mate once in their lifetime, storing the sperms inside their bodies, and the males soon die afterward. The virgin queens and drones of several adjacent colonies gather together for the flight and interbreed. No intra-colony breeding occurs. Since only monogynous colonies have been reported for this species, a new queen would need to leave her the colony of her birth and establish her own colony.|$|E
