2500|$|While {{occupied}} with the cataloguing of the Hunterian collection, Owen did not confine {{his attention to}} the preparations before him but also seized every opportunity to dissect fresh subjects. He was allowed to examine all animals that died in London Zoo's gardens and, when the Zoo began to publish scientific proceedings, in 1831, he was the most prolific contributor of anatomical papers. His first notable publication, however, was his Memoir on the Pearly Nautilus (London, 1832), which was soon recognized as a classic. Henceforth, he continued to make important contributions to every department of comparative anatomy and zoology for a period of over fifty years. In the sponges, Owen was the first to describe the now well-known Venus' Flower Basket or Euplectella (1841, 1857). Among Entozoa, his most noteworthy discovery was that of <b>Trichina</b> spiralis (1835), the parasite infesting the muscles of man in the disease now termed trichinosis (see also, however, Sir James Paget). Of Brachiopoda he made very special studies, which much advanced knowledge and settled the classification that has long been accepted. Among Mollusca, he described not only the pearly nautilus but also Spirula (1850) and other Cephalopoda, both living and extinct, and it was he who proposed the universally-accepted subdivision of this class into the two orders of Dibranchiata and Tetrabranchiata (1832). In 1852 Owen named Protichnites – the oldest footprints found on land. [...] Applying his knowledge of anatomy, he correctly postulated that these Cambrian trackways were made by an extinct type of arthropod, and he did this more than 150 years before any fossils of the animal were found. Owen envisioned a resemblance of the animal to the living arthropod Limulus, which {{was the subject of a}} special memoir he wrote in 1873.|$|E
60|$|I {{have pointed}} out, {{in an earlier}} part of this chapter, {{that the history of}} all {{branches}} of science proves that they must attain a considerable stage of development before they yield practical 'fruits;' and this is eminently true of physiology. It is only within the present epoch, that physiology and chemistry have reached the point at which they could offer a scientific foundation to agriculture; and it is only within the present epoch, that zoology and physiology have yielded any very great aid to pathology and hygiene. But within that time, they have already rendered highly important services by the exploration of the phenomena of parasitism. Not only have the history of the animal parasites, such as the tapeworms and the <b>trichina,</b> which infest men and animals, with deadly results, been cleared up by means of experimental investigations, and efficient modes of prevention deduced from the data so obtained; but the terrible agency of the parasitic fungi and of the infinitesimally minute microbes, which work far greater havoc among plants and animals, has been brought to light. The 'particulate' or 'germ' theory of disease, as it is called, long since suggested, has obtained a firm foundation, in so far as it has been proved to be true in respect of sundry epidemic disorders. Moreover, it has theoretically justified prophylactic measures, such as vaccination, which formerly rested on a merely empirical basis; and it has been extended to other diseases with excellent results. Further, just as the discovery of the cause of scabies proved the absurdity of many of the old prescriptions for the prevention and treatment of that disease; so the discovery of the cause of splenic fever, and other such maladies, has given a new direction to prophylactic and curative measures against the worst scourges of humanity. Unless the fanaticism of philozoic sentiment overpowers the voice of philanthropy, and the love of dogs and cats supersedes that of one's neighbor, the progress of experimental physiology and pathology will, indubitably, in course of time, place medicine and hygiene upon a rational basis. Two centuries ago England was devastated by the plague; cleanliness and common sense were enough to free us from its ravages. One century since, small-pox was almost as great a scourge; science, though working empirically, and almost in the dark, has reduced that evil to relative insignificance. At the present time, science, working in the light of clear knowledge, has attacked splenic fever and has beaten it; it is attacking hydrophobia with no mean promise of success; sooner or later it will deal, in the same way, with diphtheria, typhoid and scarlet fever. To one who has seen half a street swept clear of its children, or has lost his own by these horrible pestilences, passing one's offspring through the fire to Moloch seems humanity, compared with the proposal to deprive them of half their chances of health and life because of the discomfort to dogs and cats, rabbits and frogs, which may be involved in the search for means of guarding them.|$|E

40|$|The only {{record of}} Trichinella spp. in {{wildlife}} in the UK {{is a single}} case from 1957. No other wildlife cases, or indigenously acquired human cases {{have been reported in}} the literature. This survey proposed to sample muscles from approximately 1100 wild foxes (600 during phase one and 500 during phase two) and sera from 20 wild boar for Trichinella spp. A digestion method for pooled samples of fox muscle was developed for use in this survey to enable the detection of Trichinella. This modified method gave a <b>trichinae</b> recovery rate of 83 - 84 % for spiked samples. Assuming this recovery rate is applied to all contaminated samples, regardless of the level of contamination, then the test sensitivity would be 83 % for all tissue samples with 1 <b>trichinae</b> per 10 g of foreleg muscle, 97 % for samples with 2 <b>trichinae</b> per 10 g, and 99 % for samples with 3 <b>trichinae</b> per 10 g. During this survey 1048 foxes were analysed for Trichinella. Due to local difficulties, it was not possible to live sample wild boar. All muscle samples were negative for Trichinella. If the 587 fox digests from an earlier survey are included (all were negative) the upper 95 percentile confidence limit for national prevalence of Trichinella is 0. 19 %. We suggest that further foxes are collected over two winters to obtain a total of 3000 negative results, then a sampling regime of about 400 foxes are analysed per annum...|$|R

The term may also be applied to the destruction of parasites such as tapeworm and <b>trichina</b> in meat, in which case the required dose is in the range of 0.1 - 1 kGy. When the process is used specifically for destroying enteropathogenic and enterotoxinogenic organisms belonging to the genus Salmonella, it is referred to as Salmonella radicidation.|$|E
50|$|Trichinosis, {{also called}} trichinellosis, or trichiniasis, is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by eating raw or undercooked pork {{infected with the}} larvae of a species of roundworm Trichinella spiralis, commonly called the <b>trichina</b> worm.

From 2002 to 2007, an annual average of 11 cases per year were reported in the United States; the majority were from consuming wild game or the source was unknown.

5000|$|The {{original}} {{reason for}} this taboo is debated.

James George Frazer suggested that in ancient Israel, Egypt and Syria, the pig was originally a sacred animal, which for that reason could not be eaten or touched; the taboo survived to a time when the pig was no longer regarded as sacred, and was therefore explained by reference to its being unclean.|$|E

40|$|Trichinella spiralis spiralis infections were {{established}} in cattle by gavage and by feeding infected musculature in the ration. <b>Trichinae</b> were present in greatest numbers in masseter, tongue and diaphragm. Trichinella spiralis nativa had a low infectivity to cattle although a light infection was established in one cow by a heavy challenge. Cattle had an aversion to eating musculature unless it was camouflaged with molasses. Clinical signs of reluctance to eat and masticate were observed between 10 and 30 days postinfection. Eosinophil counts started to increase at seven days and peaked at about 30 days postinfection. By day 60 eosinophil counts returned to near preinfection levels but in animals examined greater than 90 days postinfection, the counts were variable. Focal lesions of eosinophilic myositis were observed up to about 90 days postinfection. Little cellular reaction was observed surrounding <b>trichinae</b> after muscle invasion and cyst development was completed except for cysts undergoing disintegration. Seroconversion occurred in all cattle examined between 7 and 14 days postinfection. Seroconversion was associated with IgG 1 and IgG 2 immunoglobulins.

During 1947 to 1951, a median of 393 human cases were reported annually, including 57 trichinellosis-related deaths. During 1997-2001, the incidence decreased to a median of 12 cases annually, with no reported deaths. The decline in infection was largely associated with changes implemented by the U.S. pork industry that have resulted in reduced prevalence of Trichinella among domestic swine. [...] In the United States, Congress passed the Federal Swine Health Protection Act, restricting the use of uncooked garbage as feed stock for pigs, and creating a voluntary <b>Trichinae</b> Herd Certification Program. The <b>Trichinae</b> Herd Certification Program is a voluntary preharvest pork safety program that provides documentation of swine management practices to minimize Trichinella exposure. The goal {{of the program is}} to establish a system under which pork production facilities that follow good production practices might be certified as Trichinella-safe.In addition to the reduction in Trichinella prevalence in commercial pork, processing methods also have contributed to the dramatic decline in human trichinellosis associated with pork products.
