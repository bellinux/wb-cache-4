The presidential oath as administered <b>to</b> <b>Obama</b> during his swearing-in ceremony on January 20 strayed slightly from the oath of office prescribed in the United States Constitution, which led to its re‑administration the next day.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} <b>to</b> <b>Obama,</b> McCain {{did well}} throughout rural Virginia. He won {{the vast majority}} of its counties. In the part of Virginia protruding out west, Obama ran roughly even with Kerry, even though he comfortably won the election and Kerry lost.

In addition, a number of unionized, Appalachian counties located next to Kentucky voted Republican; they had cast strong ballots for Bill Clinton.
