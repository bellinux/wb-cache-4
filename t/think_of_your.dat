500|$|There {{were only}} 16 presidential primary states in 1920, {{of which the}} most crucial to Harding was Ohio. Harding had to have some loyalists at the {{convention}} to have any chance of nomination, and the Wood campaign hoped to knock Harding {{out of the race}} by taking Ohio. Wood campaigned in the state, and his supporter, Procter, spent large sums; Harding spoke in the nonconfrontational style he had adopted in 1914. Harding and Daugherty were so confident of sweeping Ohio's 48 delegates that the candidate went on to the next state, Indiana, before the April 27 Ohio primary. Harding carried Ohio by only 15,000 votes over Wood, taking less than half the total vote, and won only 39 of 48 delegates. In Indiana, Harding finished fourth, with less than ten percent of the vote, and failed to win a single delegate. He was willing to give up and have Daugherty file his nomination papers for the Senate, but Florence Harding grabbed the phone from his hand, [...] "Warren Harding, what are you doing? Give up? Not until the convention is over. <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> friends in Ohio!" [...] On learning that Daugherty had left the phone line, the future First Lady retorted, [...] "Well, you tell Harry Daugherty for me that we're in this fight until Hell freezes over." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Vita Sancti Symphoriani, Symphorian of Augustodunum (present-day Autun) was {{executed}} on 22 August 178 for his Christian faith. While {{he was being}} led to his execution, [...] "his venerable mother admonished him from the wall assiduously and notable to all (?), saying in the Gaulish speech: Son, son, Symphorianus, <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> God!" [...] (uenerabilis mater sua de muro sedula et nota illum uoce Gallica monuit dicens: 'nate, nate Synforiane, mentobeto to diuo' [...] ). The Gaulish sentence has been transmitted in a corrupt state in the various manuscripts; as it stands, it has been reconstructed by Thurneysen. According to David Stifter (2012), *mentobeto looks like a Proto-Romance verb derived from Latin mens, mentis ‘mind’ and habere ‘to have’, and it cannot be excluded that the whole utterance is an early variant of Romance, or a mixture of Romance and Gaulish, instead of being an instance of pure Gaulish. On the other hand, nate is attested in Gaulish (for example in Endlicher's Glossary), {{and the author of}} the Vita Sancti Symphoriani, whether or not fluent in Gaulish, evidently expects a non-Latin language to have been spoken at the time.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh no! No one <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> appearance, {{you are so}} {{sensible}} and useful, Mary. Beauty is of very little consequence in reality," [...] said Rosamond, turning her head towards Mary, but with eyes swerving towards the new view of her neck in the glass.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, Mr. Ericson," [...] said Mrs. Henkel, a plump, decent, disapproving person, who {{had known}} too many generations of great Platonians to be {{impressed}} by anything, [...] "you see what the public <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> Professor Frazer. I told you people wouldn't stomach such news, and I wouldn't wonder if they strongly disapproved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{the wonder}} of it!... I knew--I prayed--I trusted. Lassiter, I almost gave--all myself to soften you to Mormons. Thank God, and thank you, my friend.... But, selfish woman that I am, this is no great test. What's the life {{of one of those}} sneaking cowards to such a man as you? I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> great hate toward him who--I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life's implacable purpose. Can it be--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> remembering that!--but I'm {{improved}} since then. I've {{been taking}} lessons with my old aunt at Castlebar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Unripe figs {{for your}} Christianity and your Koran!' exclaimed Darkush. 'Do {{you know what}} we <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> Christianity and your Koran?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{about your}} thinking, Jane," [...] Mrs. Brookenham placidly explained, [...] "that Nanda suffers--in her morals, don't you know?--by my neglect. I wouldn't say {{anything}} about you that I can't bravely say TO you; therefore since he has plumped out with it I do confess that I've appealed to him on what, as so good an old friend, HE <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> contention." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite! Though I don't <b>think</b> much <b>of</b> <b>your</b> idea <b>of</b> a playhouse--those tin cans. But it's {{better than}} having to be grown-up." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But, goodman," [...] {{interrupted}} Mr. Middleburgh, [...] "you must <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> own household first, or {{else you}} are worse even than the infidels." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been a deep subconsciousness of the fillet and mushrooms. Or perhaps I didn't quite like to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> lunching alone." ...|$|E

6000|$|She spoke, sharply. [...] "You mustn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> getting <b>your</b> fees too easy, Ben. I don't {{think any}} good lawyer wins without work. Do you?" ...|$|R
