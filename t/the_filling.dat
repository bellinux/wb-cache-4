5|$|Cylinder working {{pressure}} is specified at a reference temperature, usually 15°C or 20°C. and cylinders {{also have a}} specified maximum safe working temperature, often 65°C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable {{in terms of the}} standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference temperature does not exceed the specified {{working pressure}} stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified working pressure when <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> temperature is greater than the reference temperature, but not more than 65°C, provided that <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct working pressure when cooled to the reference temperature.|$|E

5|$|Electron {{affinity}} generally increases {{across a}} period. This {{is caused by}} <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> of the valence shell of the atom; a group 17 atom releases more energy than a group 1 atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled valence shell and is therefore more stable.|$|E

5|$|With the {{development}} of modern quantum mechanical theories of electron configurations within atoms, {{it became apparent that}} each period (row) in the table corresponded to <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> of a quantum shell of electrons.

The first experimental evidence for <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> of the 5f shell in actinides was obtained by McMillan and Abelson in 1940. As in lanthanides (see lanthanide contraction), the ionic radius of actinides monotonically decreases with atomic number (see also Aufbau principle).|$|E
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} by attaching a high-pressure gas {{supply to the}} cylinder valve, opening the valve and allowing gas to flow into the cylinder until the desired pressure is reached, then closing the valves, venting the connection and disconnecting it. This process involves a risk of the cylinder or <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> equipment failing under pressure, {{both of which are}} hazardous to the operator, so procedures to control these risks are generally followed.|$|E

5|$|Forensic archaeologists {{can help}} {{determine}} potential grave sites {{that might have}} been overlooked. Differences in the soil can help forensic archaeologists locate these sites. During the burial of a body, a small mound of soil will form from <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> of the grave. The loose soil and increasing nutrients from the decomposing body encourages different kinds of plant growth than surrounding areas. Typically, grave sites will have looser, darker, more organic soil than areas around it. The search for additional grave sites can be useful during the investigation of genocide and mass graves to search for additional burial locations.|$|E
5|$|New Melones was {{the focus}} of a long {{environmental}} battle during the 1970s and early 1980s; critics protested the flooding of a long scenic stretch of the Stanislaus River, which flowed over whitewater rapids through the deepest limestone canyon in the western United States. The protestors employed a variety of methods, some extreme, to prevent <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> of New Melones Lake until 1983, when record-setting floods filled the reservoir and nearly breached the dam's emergency spillway. The fight over New Melones galvanized the river conservation movement in California and influenced major water policy changes on the state and federal levels; since its completion, no other dams of its size or importance have been built in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Crossflow is {{a design}} {{in which the}} air flow is {{directed}} perpendicular to the water flow (see diagram at left). Air flow enters one or more vertical faces of the cooling tower to meet <b>the</b> <b>fill</b> material.

40|$|Telescopes and imaging interferometers with sparsely filled {{apertures}} can be lighter {{weight and}} less expensive than conventional filled-aperture telescopes. Sparse-aperture systems can be characterized by their fill factor, which is {{the ratio of the}} area of a given aperture to the area of a filled aperture having comparable theoretical resolution. We show that the modulation transfer function (MTF) at the midrange spatial frequencies tends to be proportional to <b>the</b> <b>fill</b> factor. Using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions for various sources of noise, we derive the relationship between the integration time, needed to achieve a given SNR, and <b>the</b> <b>fill</b> factor. For example, for a fixed, sparse array, the integration time is proportional to the inverse cube of <b>the</b> <b>fill</b> factor for photon noise, to the inverse square of <b>the</b> <b>fill</b> factor for readout noise, and to the inverse fourth-power of <b>the</b> <b>fill</b> factor for dark current...|$|R
5|$|Preload {{refers to}} <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when they are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium {{exhibits}} two valence states; the +5 is stable, and the +4 state easily oxidizes to protactinium(V). Thus tetravalent protactinium in solutions {{is obtained}} {{by the action of}} strong reducing agents in a hydrogen atmosphere. Tetravalent protactinium is chemically similar to uranium(IV) and thorium(IV). Fluorides, phosphates, hypophosphate, iodate and phenylarsonates of protactinium(IV) are insoluble in water and dilute acids. Protactinium forms soluble carbonates. The hydrolytic properties of pentavalent protactinium are close to those of tantalum(V) and niobium(V). The complex chemical behavior of protactinium is a consequence of the start of <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> of the 5f shell in this element.|$|E
