40|$|Alfalfa is {{the most}} {{important}} forage crop in Utah. It is of particular importance to the Uintah Basin, Utah area where alfalfa hay and seed production are major sources of agricultural income. This crop owes much of its popularity {{to the fact that it}} will normally produce large yields of good forage on land which is unsuited to more intensive cultivation. In many cases it is impractical to advocate disease control practices which involve extra labor or expense and as a result most diseases of alfalfa, if controlled at all, are controlled by the use of resistant varieties. During the past few years alfalfa witches 2 ̆ 7 broom has become detrimental in the Uintah Basin area. This disease shortens the length of life of alfalfa stands and reduces the yield. Some diseased stands are killed out in a period of three years. It is difficult and expensive to reestablish alfalfa in this area where water supplies are usually low. Therefore, it is imperative that alfalfa stands remain in production for several years. These problems justify a study to find resistance to alfalfa witches 2 ̆ 7 broom.

Despite the complexity and diversity of bridge structures, a highly simplified model of the bridge structure is used. An estimate of the noise emitted by wheel and rail is also incorporated.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the Reynolds number is for certain aeroelastic and aerodynamic phenomena of high significance, in particular in case the flow is dominated by massive separation areas, like bluff body flows. These kind of flows are broadly represented in our daily life, e. g. in the aerospace industry (landing gear doors, propeller blades of single turboprops or piston twin aircrafts during start or landing), civil engineering (overhead <b>transmission</b> lines, <b>bridge</b> decks, pillars of semi-submerged offshore structures) or in wind engineering (blade-tower interactions and deep dynamic stall). The structures are subject to fluid-structure interactions, which in many cases lead to flow-induced vibrations like galloping or flutter and, in case of large amplitudes, even to damage of parts {{or failure of the}} complete construction. In order to minimize or even suppress those undesired flow-induced vibrations, it is of great concern to understand in detail the unsteady three-dimensional flow characteristics around these structures. For that purpose a new test section was designed and built to be implemented inside the High-Pressure Wind Tunnel Gottingen, a test facility in which the air pressure can be increased up to 100 bar to simulate realistic flow conditions at Reynolds numbers up to 10 million. The test section consists out of two torque motors that are used to either set and maintain a steady angle of incidence within 0 and 359 deg or to let the two-dimensional wind tunnel model perform a forced pitching motion with amplitudes of up to +/- 15 deg at maximum pitching frequencies of 15 Hz (i. e. reduced frequencies of k 1) around a certain steady angle of incidence.

30|$|In {{social network}} theory, edge betweenness–a metric based on {{shortest}} paths–is the predominant metric for characterizing {{the importance of}} a relationship between actors. Other notable notions of edge importance to network structure are those of bridges and local bridges. The designation of a bridge is a form of edge structural importance, albeit a binary one. The mathematical concept of bridging was first introduced by Harary et al. (1965). For undirected graphs, an edge (i,j) is a bridge when (i,j) is the only path from i to j. The removal of a bridge disconnects a network. The concept of local bridging was explored in a sociological context by Granovetter (1983, 1973). Granovetter remarked that true bridges are unlikely in large social networks, where alternate paths are common. However, such alternate paths may be rather long and thus inefficient routes for information <b>transmission.</b> A local <b>bridge</b> is an edge whose removal would not necessarily disconnect the network but would still be significantly disruptive to information flow. More precisely, local bridges are edges (i,j) where the next shortest path from i to j has a length of at least three. Hence, local bridges facilitate information flow between parts of the network that would otherwise be distant and difficult to reach.|$|R

40|$|Expansion and {{improvement}} of the nation’s electricity transmission system are crucial for {{increasing the amount of}} electricity generated by renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources, such as wind and tidal, tend to be located far from population centers, and electricity <b>transmission</b> lines must <b>bridge</b> that gap. In addition to its importance for meeting renewable energy goals, a better connected and more robust transmission system also bolsters reliability because it can draw on many generation sources in the event that a generator or segment of the transmission network fails.

The short run locational signals we evaluate are sent by nodal pricing and the long run ones are sent by the average participation use-of-the-network tariff. Their joint implementation is also deemed. Numerical simulations are performed on a two-node network evolving during twenty years with increasing demand. The efficiency of these locational signals to coordinate the location of generation with lumpy transmission investments is measured. An independent Transmission System Operator invests to minimize {{the total cost of}} the network, that is to say the sum of the cost of congestion with the cost of transmission investments. And a unique generator behaving competitively chooses the location of her investments depending on two elements: the locational difference in generation investment costs and the costs of the network she may pay with short run nodal prices and with the long run average participation tariff. The network tariff varies with the transmission investments. And the transmission capacity greatly influences nodal prices. We find out that neither short run nodal prices nor long run average participation tariffs can thoroughly coordinate efficiently generation and transmission investments because of the lumpiness of <b>transmission</b> line capacities. <b>Bridging</b> Energy Supply and Demand: Logistics, Competition Environment...|$|R

On the one hand, as time has moved on, new power electronic devices such as the Voltage Source Converter (VSC), are being used in both FACTS and HVDC transmission [10]. For instance, VSCs are used in STATCOM applications, which is a FACTS technology, to provide reactive power support [11]. But, when two such devices are connected in cascade, we have the VSC-HVDC rather different from the classical HVDC <b>transmission</b> using thyristor-based <b>bridges</b> and phase control [12].

As a matter of fact, the introduction of these technologies in an all-encompassed manner within the electrical business provides a solid foundation on which to build the new and smarter energy grid [16].

40|$|The {{dependence}} of electron transfer rates and yields in bridged molecular systems {{on the bridge}} length, and the {{dependence of}} the zero-bias conduction of molecular wires on wire length are discussed. Both phenomena are controlled by tunneling across the molecular bridge and are consequently expected to show exponential decrease with bridge length that is indeed often observed. Deviations from this exponential dependence for long bridges, in particular a crossover to a very weak dependence on bridge length were recently observed experimentally and discussed theoretically in terms of thermal relaxation and dephasing on the bridge. Here we discuss two other factors that potentially affect the bridge length dependence of these phenomena. First, in experiments initiated by an initial preparation of a non-stationary "donor" state the initial energy is not well defined. A small contribution from initially populated eigenstates that are of mostly bridge-level character may dominate <b>transmission</b> for long <b>bridges,</b> resulting in weak or no bridge-length dependence. Secondly, in steady state experiments the distribution of initial states (for example the Fermi distribution at the electrodes in conduction experiments) will cause deviations from exponential dependence on wire length because even a small population in higher energy states will dominate the transmission through long wires. For the first scenario we show that the crossover behavior observed for electron transfer in DNA between G and GGG species separated by AT chains can be largely reproduced just by initial state effects.

40|$|Wild {{terrestrial}} birds can act {{as potential}} local spreaders or bridge hosts for avian influenzaviruses (AIVs) between waterfowl (the maintenance hosts of AIVs) and domestic avianpopulations in which AIVs may cause disease. Few studies have investigated this hypothesis,although {{it is an important}} knowledge gap in our understanding of AIV spread within socio-ecosystems. We designed a simple and reproducible approach in an agro-ecosystem inZimbabwe based on: (1) bird counts at key target sites (i. e., wetlands, villages, intensivepoultry production buildings and ostrich farms) to identify which wild birds species co-occur in these different sites and seasons when the risk of AIV <b>transmission</b> through thesepotential <b>bridge</b> hosts is maximal and (2) targeted sampling and testing for AIV infectionin the identified potential bridge hosts. We found that 12 wild bird species represented thevast majority (79 %) of co-occurrences in the different sites, whereas 230 bird species wererecorded in this ecosystem. Specifically, three species – barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, red-billed quelea, Quelea quelea and cattle egret, Bubulcus ibis – represented the main potentialbridge host species (65 % of co-occurrences). In two out of these three species (i. e., barnswallow and red-billed quelea), we detected AIV infections, confirming that they can play abridge function between waterfowl and domestic species in the ecosystem. Our approachcan be easily implemented in other ecosystems to identify potential bridge hosts, and ourresults have implications in terms of surveillance, risk management and control of AIVspread in socio-ecosystems.
