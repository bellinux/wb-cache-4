5|$|After {{losing the}} {{connection}} to the Lincoln Highway, officials convinced planners of the Victory Highway to traverse the state. The highway entered Colorado from Kansas along what was previously called <b>the</b> <b>Smoky</b> Hill Trail. The highway crossed the mountains along a trail blazed by a railroad surveyor and captain in the American Civil War, cresting at Berthoud Pass. After a round of political infighting between Utah and Nevada, the Victory Highway would become the Lincoln Highway's main rival for San Francisco-bound traffic. When the U.S. Highway system was unveiled in 1926, the Victory Highway was numbered U.S. Highway 40.|$|E

50|$|Pioneer {{settlers}} of <b>the</b> Great <b>Smoky</b> Mountains created old-time music ballads, {{before their}} relocation, by {{the creation of}} Great Smoky Mountains National Park. To help celebrate this heritage, Townsend, Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, and other locations in <b>the</b> Great <b>Smoky</b> Mountains, host annual festivals, some of which feature folk and bluegrass music. <b>The</b> Great <b>Smoky</b> Mountains Association also promotes events with mountain music, and has released several albums, featuring various artists. <b>The</b> Great <b>Smoky</b> Mountains Heritage Center, in Townsend, also helps to preserve this pioneer cultural heritage. In addition, the Museum of Appalachia, in Norris, hosts occasional folk music performances.|$|R
5|$|In the 18th and 19th century, {{green was}} {{associated}} with the romantic movement in literature and art. The French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau celebrated the virtues of nature, The German poet and philosopher Goethe declared that green was the most restful color, suitable for decorating bedrooms. Painters such as John Constable and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot depicted the lush green of rural landscapes and forests. Green was contrasted to <b>the</b> <b>smoky</b> grays and blacks of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
5|$|K-232's route {{was first}} {{designated}} as {{the part of the}} current highway between Interstate 70 and Old U.S. 40 (then U.S. Route 40) in 1962. The rest of the highway's route was established over the following two years. K-232 has been paved since the highway was designated. Due to the area's natural beauty and unique heritage, K-232 has been designated by the Kansas Department of Transportation as the Post Rock Scenic Byway, named for the abundance of limestone fenceposts found throughout <b>the</b> <b>Smoky</b> Hills region.|$|E
5|$|Other hazards include venomous snakes, {{including}} the Eastern timber rattlesnake and copperhead, which are common along the trail. Both snakes are generally found in drier, rockier {{sections of the}} trail; the copperhead's range extends north to around the New Jersey–New York state line, while rattlesnakes are commonly found along the trail in Connecticut and have been reported, although rarely, {{as far north as}} New Hampshire. Other large mammals commonly sighted include deer; elk, reintroduced in <b>the</b> <b>Smoky</b> Mountains; and moose, which may be found in the vicinity of Massachusetts and northward.|$|E

5|$|The {{mountains}} of Sawtooth National Forest have a varied geological history. The northern Sawtooth Mountains formed from the Eocene Sawtooth batholith, while south of Alturas Lake the Sawtooth, Smoky, and Soldier mountains formed from the Cretaceous granodiorite of the Idaho Batholith. Foothills of <b>the</b> <b>Smoky</b> Mountains {{are from the}} Pennsylvanian and Permian Dollarhide formations. The White Cloud Mountains are underlain by the gray granodiorite of the Idaho batholith, {{while some of the}} exposed rock is baked impure limestone from the Permian Grand Prize Formation.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Charles Mortram Sternberg {{reported}} {{the presence of}} the footprints of a large, four-footed dinosaur from Lower Cretaceous rocks in British Columbia, Canada. He described a new ichnogenus and species for these tracks, Tetrapodosaurus borealis, and attributed them to ceratopsians. However, in 1984 paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter re-examined the British Columbian Tetrapodosaurus prints and argued that they were made by ankylosaurs rather than ceratopsians. Specifically, Carpenter concluded that these were probably the footprints of Sauropelta. Five years later, large numbers of Tetrapodosaurus tracks were discovered at <b>the</b> <b>Smoky</b> River Coal Mine near Grande Cache, Alberta. This site is considered the most important ankylosaur track site in the world.|$|E

5|$|On April 25, 1935 at 6:43pm, a {{custodial}} engineer {{called the}} Salem Fire Department to report smoke. Citizens helped to remove items from <b>the</b> <b>smoky</b> building, but when firefighters arrived, they ordered everyone {{to leave the}} structure, which was soon engulfed in flame. Among the helping citizens was twelve-year-old Mark Hatfield, who later became governor. It was determined the fire started {{in the basement of}} the east wing and quickly spread to piles of old records. A strong updraft in the hollow columns enclosing the dome's eight supporting steel lattice girders pulled the flames through the rotunda to upper stories. The intense heat burned even the copper dome and lit the night sky.|$|E
5|$|The event {{consisted}} of four tag-team elimination matches and a bout for <b>the</b> <b>Smoky</b> Mountain Wrestling Tag Team Championship. The main event match saw the All-Americans, {{a team of}} face wrestlers from the United States, competing against the Foreign Fanatics, a team of heels that represented other countries. The All-Americans won the match when Lex Luger was the last man remaining. In an undercard match, {{four members of the}} Hart family competed against Shawn Michaels and a group of masked men. The original plan was for the Harts to face Jerry Lawler, with whom they were feuding, but Lawler was not able to appear at the event. The Harts won the match, but a confrontation between Bret Hart and Owen Hart after the match led to Owen turning against the family the following year.|$|E
5|$|Specimens {{assigned}} to Pteranodon {{have been found}} in both <b>the</b> <b>Smoky</b> Hill Chalk deposits of the Niobrara Formation, and the slightly younger Sharon Springs deposits of the Pierre Shale Formation. When Pteranodon was alive, this area was covered by a large inland sea, known as the Western Interior Seaway. Famous for fossils collected since 1870, these formations extend from as far south as Kansas in the United States to Manitoba in Canada. However, Pteranodon specimens (or any pterosaur specimens) have only been found in the southern half of the formation, in Kansas, Wyoming, and South Dakota. Despite the fact that numerous fossils {{have been found in}} the contemporary parts of the formation in Canada, no pterosaur specimens have ever been found there. This strongly suggests that the natural geographic range of Pteranodon covered only {{the southern part of the}} Niobrara, and that its habitat did not extend farther north than South Dakota.|$|E

5|$|The heat is made {{tangible}} by the flustered {{appearance of}} the woman as she fans herself (the fan itself displays a classical scene—perhaps Venus, Adonis and Cupid); the sluggish pregnant dog that looks longingly towards the water; and the vigorous vine growing {{on the side of}} the tavern. As is often the case in Hogarth's work, the dog's expression reflects that of its master. The family rush home, past the New River and a tavern with a sign showing Sir Hugh Myddleton, who bankrupted himself financing the construction of the river to bring running water into London in 1613 (a wooden pipe lies by the side of the watercourse). Through the open window other refugees from the city can be seen sheltering from the oppressive heat in the bar. While they appear more jolly than the dyer and his family, Hogarth pokes fun at these people escaping to the country for fresh air only to reproduce <b>the</b> <b>smoky</b> air and crowded conditions of the city by huddling in the busy tavern with their pipes.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape and}} size of the egg mass is {{characteristic}} of the species. Ranids tend to produce globular clusters containing large numbers of eggs whereas bufonids produce long, cylindrical strings. The tiny yellow-striped pygmy eleuth (Eleutherodactylus limbatus) lays eggs singly, burying them in moist soil. <b>The</b> <b>smoky</b> jungle frog (Leptodactylus pentadactylus) makes a nest of foam in a hollow. The eggs hatch when the nest is flooded, or the tadpoles may complete their development in the foam if flooding does not occur. The red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas) deposits its eggs on a leaf above a pool and when they hatch, the larvae fall into the water below. The larvae developing in the eggs can detect vibrations caused by nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten. In general, the length of the egg stage depends on the species and the environmental conditions. Aquatic eggs normally hatch within one week when the capsule splits as a result of enzymes released by the developing larvae.|$|E
