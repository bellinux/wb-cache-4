40|$|Liability for patent {{infringement}} is statutorily {{limited to}} the term of the patent. However nothing limits recovery to losses suffered during that same term. Since patent infringement is tort-like in many respects, <b>traditional</b> <b>damages</b> principles apply to quantify damages suffered after the expiry of the patent. Recent Canadian and English case law has indicated a willingness to consider such recovery. Consequently, the courts may be far less willing to grant springboarding injunctions. Patentees seeking to prevent springboarders must satisfy the tripartite interlocutory injunction test, which requires demonstration of irreparable harm. Since post-expiry losses may now be considered quantifiable and recoverable, a patentee will seldom demonstrate that it will suffer irreparable harm.

40|$|Abstract. The usual {{approach}} for flood damage assessment consists of stage-damage functions which relate the relative or absolute damage {{for a certain}} class of objects to the in-undation depth. Other characteristics of the flooding situa-tion and of the flooded object are rarely taken into account, although flood damage is influenced {{by a variety of}} fac-tors. We apply a group of data-mining techniques, known as tree-structured models, to flood damage assessment. A very comprehensive data set of more than 1000 records of direct building damage of private households in Germany is used. Each record contains details about a large variety of poten-tial damage-influencing characteristics, such as hydrological and hydraulic aspects of the flooding situation, early warning and emergency measures undertaken, state of precaution of the household, building characteristics and socio-economic status of the household. Regression trees and bagging de-cision trees are used to select the more important damage-influencing variables and to derive multi-variate flood dam-age models. It is shown that these models outperform exist-ing models, and that tree-structured models are a promising alternative to <b>traditional</b> <b>damage</b> models. ...|$|E

These two damage detection techniques are compared numerically and experimentally using measurements from two structures, a simply supported beam and a pedestrian bridge. The dynamic properties for the numerical comparison are extracted by modal analysis in ABAQUS, while the dynamic characteristics for the experimental comparison are obtained with the Wireless Sensor Network and the Time Domain Decomposition. In both the numerical and experimental phases, the accuracy of damage predictions from each method is quantified.

40|$|AbstractMaterial failure {{analysis}} {{based on the}} constitutive model of isotropic softening hyperelasticity is presented. In addition to the bulk and shear moduli the model includes only one material constant of volumetric failure work. The latter {{is in contrast to}} the <b>traditional</b> <b>damage</b> theories, which include internal variables that are difficult to calibrate experimentally. The softening hyperelasticity model is used to analyze the critical hydrostatic tension corresponding to the onset of instability of spherical and cylindrical voids. It is shown that the critical tension predicted by the softening hyperelasticity model does not depend on the void size in agreement with the linear elasticity solution showing that the stress/strain state {{at the edge of the}} void does not depend on its size. This prediction stays in contrast to the prediction based on the Griffith energy method where the critical tension depends on the size of the void and tends to infinity when the void radius approaches zero. It is argued that the controversial results of the Griffith method are a consequence of a separation of stress analysis and criticality conditions. It is concluded, based on the considered examples, that a description of material failure should be an inseparable part of constitutive models of materials...|$|E

40|$|Condition based {{monitoring}} (CBM) is {{a subset}} of structural health monitoring (SHM) that is focused on monitoring vibration signals generated by rotating machines in situ and processing the data by various techniques designed to extract damage-sensitive features {{as a means of}} performing damage (e. g., bearing and gear failure) presence, location, or extent. To date, a wide variety of CBM techniques have been documented in the literature and are well accepted in the CBM community. The literature provides current technical means for extracting damage features and in some cases the trending of features in run-to-failure experiments under constant mechanical parameters such as load and rotational speed, but it lacks any statistical analysis on the effects that varying parameters of the mechanical systems for binary damage states have on detectability. Specifications on data acquisition and choice of algorithm parameters used in extracting the damage-sensitive features remain somewhat vague.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the {{development}} of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has been skyrocketing because of the serious consequences that come with structural failure. <b>Traditional</b> <b>damage</b> detection techniques, also known as local damage detections, such as visual inspection and ultrasonic testing, have been implemented since the mid 20 th century. However, these techniques often require prior knowledge of potential damage locations and require bulky testing equipment. Alternative techniques, the Global Vibration Techniques, were first introduced to analyze the modal information of the structure to assess its overall health state. The drawback of these methods is their insensitivity towards the incipient local damage. With {{the development of}} sensor technology, a local damage detection technique, the Electro-Mechanical Impedance (EMI) method, has emerged. EMI measures the electrical admittance by the impedance analyzer, and evaluates the health status of the structure by comparing the baseline signature with the damaged signature. It allows users to access the structure remotely, but it loses its sensitivity when the damage is significant. Therefore, Bhalla, Shanker and Gupta proposed integrating the Global Vibration Techniques with the EMI technique so as to tap on {{the strengths of the}} respective techniques. This new method, the Integration of Global Vibration Technique and EMI Technique, draws on EMI's high sensitivity towards early incipient damage and Global Vibration Techniques' sensitivity at late damage stages. The author further examines the integrated method in terms of practicality and scalability. With considerations of some sensor related issues, the author would not suggest to apply the method to real structures. by Suteng Ni. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|For {{advanced}} heterogeneous {{materials in}} many applications, material state changes occur during service. The evolution of local details (damage initiation, accumulation, growth, and interaction) controls {{the progress of}} global property degradation, and they control {{the development of the}} final fracture event, i. e., the life of the engineering component. <b>Traditional</b> <b>damage</b> analysis approaches focus on the detection and location of flaws and defects, not on interactions or relationships between flaws or on the general change of state of the material. However, the changes in stiffness, thermal and electrical conductivity, dielectric permittivity, and structural integrity as a function of those properties are essential information. Therefore, a definitive definition and understanding of the multiphysics changes at the material level is needed. Because creation of a single microscopic crack or other distributed events does not directly affect the strength or life of the composite materials, what is needed is a method of integrating material state changes over the history of events associated with a specific history of applied fields into methodology for predicting remaining strength, stiffness, and life. The approach discussed in this article is founded on the method of Reifsnider, et al., as codified in his text on “Damage Tolerance and Durability of Material Systems” (Wiley, 2003), and on subsequent developments associated with the Energy Frontier Research Center on Heterogeneous Functional Materials led by the University of South Carolina (www. HeteroFoaM. com). As a result of capabilities developed in connection with the HeteroFoaM center, a multiphysics capability has been developed for prognosis in the presence of progressive damage. One of the most interesting aspects of that work is the “generalized compliance method” in which electrical (or thermal) conductivity, dielectric permittivity, and mechanical state variables are tracked and predicted as a method of assessing changes in material and structural integrity for progressive damage. As it happens, the relationship between changes in conduction, for example, and dielectric permittivity as a function of nonconservative deformation history is not linear and must be predicted from first principles solutions to the correct set of multiphysics equations. We have successfully illustrated this capability for polymer-based composites. We will discuss this and other details of this multidisciplinary approach...|$|E

To examine environments that support damaging wind producing convection, sounding parameters from Rapid Update Cycle model analyses (at 3 -hourly intervals) from 2003 were compared with 7055 reports of damaging winds and 377 081 occurrences of lightning. Ground-relative wind velocity was the most effective at discriminating between damaging and nondamaging wind convective environments. Steep surface-based lapse rates (a <b>traditional</b> <b>damaging</b> wind parameter) gener-ally did not discriminate between damaging and nondamaging wind convective environments. Other pa-rameters, such as convective available potential energy, humidity aloft, and lapse rates aloft were moder-ately discriminating. This paper presents a composite damaging wind algorithm {{in which the two}} most discriminatory parameters were combined, yielding more skill than any individual parameter. Damaging wind environments are then examined further through a selection of cases that highlight common severe wind ingredients and failure modes. A primary result is that, even in seemingly favorable environments, when the winds {{at the top of the}} inflow layer were either parallel to the convective line or blowing from warm to cold over a front, damaging winds were less likely. In the former case, it appears that the downdraft winds and the cold pool’s gust-front-normal flow are not additive. In the latter case, it appears that convection becomes elevated and does not produce downdrafts that reach the surface. Combining the most discriminatory severe wind parameters with knowledge of these severe wind failure modes may help to improve the situational awareness of forecasters. 1...|$|R

40|$|Accurate damage {{inspection}} and reliable health monitoring of dynamical systems rely on accurate dynamical data computation. In theory, if all three variables (i. e., displacement, velocity, and acceleration) of each point on a dynamical system {{are available from}} measurement, system identification/damage detection methods can be easily and accurately performed. In the experiment, however, there is often only one variable is measured because collocating three different sensors at a point is too difficult even if the sensors are small enough not to affect the system's dynamic characteristics. Numerical investigations reveal that velocity is the best choice because the corresponding acceleration and displacement can be estimated by numerical differentiation and integration and because today's laser vibrometers can provide very accurate measurements of velocities. Therefore, with the velocity signal as the single measurand, efficient and accurate numerical computation methods are needed to compute the corresponding displacement and acceleration signals. Ideally, an intelligent structure {{will be able to}} realize real-time monitoring that the occurrence of damage can be identified at a very early stage. Then, by localizing the existed damage, a detailed analysis of the damaged structure section can be carried out such as determine the severity of the damage or the remaining service life of the structure. Two direct time-domain methods and two indirect time-domain methods for system identification are reviewed in this thesis. The feasibility of using these system identification methods for level 1 damage detection has been discussed in this thesis. While some of the methods can realize a realtime monitoring and quick feedback, some can only realize periodic inspections or cannot reflect small change in modal parameters. Two origin methods as stiffness-characteristic matrix method (stiffness-CMM) and mass characteristic matrix method (mass-CMM) for damage localization are proposed in this thesis, and it is the concentration of the thesis. Different from <b>traditional</b> <b>damage</b> detection methods, proposed methods do not require the corresponding intact beam structure for comparison. While measured signals only processed in the spatial domain, a weighting matrix developed from the finite element model of the beam structure is used for computing the damage index on each measured location. The largest (filtered) damage index indicate the actual damage location. Two different weighting matrixes are used in proposed methods and the mass-CMM is more robust to measuring noise. Application of the two methods is demonstrated through numerical examples. In addition, experimental vibration data of damaged beam structure measured using a PSV- 200 scanning laser vibrometer are also used to verify the accuracy of these methods...|$|E
