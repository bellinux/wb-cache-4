500|$|Cope's {{views on}} human races would today be {{considered}} racist, and his beliefs {{were used by}} scientists of the time to justify imperialism. He believed that if, [...] "a race was not white then it was inherently more ape-like". He was not opposed to blacks because of <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> but their [...] "degrading vices", believing that the [...] "inferior Negro {{should go back to}} Africa." [...] He did not blame blacks for their perceived [...] "poor virtue", but wrote, [...] "A vulture will always eat carrion when surrounded on all hands by every kind of cleaner food. It {{is the nature of the}} bird." [...] Cope was against the modern view of women's rights, believing in the husband's role as protector; he was opposed to women's suffrage, as he felt they would be unduly influenced by their husbands.|$|E
500|$|The school’s {{refusal to}} play Ward in the Georgia Tech game later {{became part of}} the public legacy of President Gerald R. Ford. Ward {{recalled}} that he met “my man Jerry” during freshman orientation in 1932, and the two became friends and roommates when the football team traveled for road games. When Ford learned that the school had capitulated to Georgia Tech, some accounts indicate that he [...] "quit the team" [...] or threatened to quit in order [...] "to make a statement and take a stand because Willis Ward was his friend." [...] Ford wrote about the Georgia Tech incident in his autobiography, recalling that he felt the decision to keep Willis out of the game was [...] "morally wrong." [...] “I went to Willis himself. He urged me to play. [...] ‘Look,’ he said, ‘the team’s having a bad year. We’ve lost two games already and we probably won’t win any more. You’ve got to play Saturday. You owe it to the team.’ [...] I decided he was right. That Saturday afternoon, we hit like never before and beat Georgia Tech 9–2.” [...] Years later, Ford wrote that the Ward incident had influenced his thinking about race. Ford noted: “His sacrifice led me to question how educational administrators could capitulate to raw prejudice.” [...] Ford used the story to voice his support for U-M’s affirmative action admissions policy saying, “Do we really want to risk turning back the clock to an era when the Willis Wards were isolated and penalized for <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin,</b> their economic standing or national ancestry?” ...|$|E

2500|$|Residential {{segregation}} persists for {{a variety}} of reasons. Segregated neighborhoods may be reinforced by the practice of [...] "steering" [...] by real estate agents.

2500|$|Speaking {{shortly after}} the shootings of Castile and Alton Sterling, President Barack Obama did {{not comment on the}} {{specific}} incidents, but called on the U.S. to [...] "do better" [...] and said that controversial incidents arising from the police use of force were [...] "not isolated incidents" [...] but rather were [...] "symptomatic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system". Obama expressed [...] "extraordinary appreciation and respect {{for the vast majority of}} police officers" [...] and noted the difficult nature of the job. He stated, [...] "When incidents like this occur, there's a big chunk of our citizenry that feels as if, because of <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin,</b> they are not being treated the same, and that hurts, and that should trouble all of us.

2500|$|King {{considered}} {{raising children}} {{in a society that}} discriminated against them serious, and spoke against her husband whenever the two disagreed on financial needs of their family. The Kings had four children; Yolanda, Martin III, Dexter and Bernice. All four children later followed in their parents' footsteps as civil rights activists. King thought she raised them to be proud of <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin,</b> until being asked by her daughter Yolanda why [...] "white people are pretty and Negroes are ugly?" [...] Her daughter Bernice referred to her as [...] "My favorite person." [...] Years after King's death, Bernice would say her mother [...] "spearheaded the effort to establish the King Center in Atlanta as the official living memorial for Martin Luther King Jr., and then went on to champion a national holiday commemorating our father's birthday, {{and a host of other}} efforts; and so in many respects she paved the way and made it possible for the most hated man in America in 1968 to now being one of the most revered and loved men in the world." [...] Dexter Scott King's resigning four months after becoming president of the King Center has often been attributed to differences with his mother. Dexter's work saw a reduction of workers from 70 to 14, and also removed a child care center his mother had founded.|$|E
