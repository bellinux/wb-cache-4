5|$|Whilst {{reading for}} a maths {{scholarship}} at the University of Marburg, Shaw Jeffrey {{was offered the}} chance to work at Trent College, unofficially, as first the headmaster's private secretary, and then as a teacher. Unfortunately, he was unable to win the Marburg scholarship in 1881, and, left unemployed after the death of the Headmaster the year after, he took up a post as a junior master at Emanuel School, Wandsworth, soon after its move to new premises. On 30 January 1884, he matriculated into the University of Oxford as a member of The Queen's College, where he completed a Bachelor of Arts in 1887 and was granted his MA in 1890. He was disappointed to receive a degree with only third-class honours, however, and was advised <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>any</b> ambition of teaching on hold—advice which he did not follow.|$|E

Stamkos did not return to the lineup for the Lightning that season.|$|E

25|$|Blackford’s {{income was}} still not {{enough for him to}} subsist on. In 1813, he {{traveled}} to the territorial capital, Vincennes. There he was admitted to the bar {{with the help of his}} friend John Test; he was only the thirtieth lawyer admitted to the bar in the territory. The same year he was elected principal clerk for the Indiana Territory House of Representatives. He also became a cashier at the Corydon branch Bank of Vincennes, the same town the capital was moved to at the end of 1813. He became aware of corruption at the bank which later folded in the Panic of 1819; numerous investors lost their money and the scandalous abuses were revealed to the public. The experience influenced him to mistrust banks throughout his life, and led him to refuse <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>any</b> money in banks.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Dennis {{also built}} one 12-metre Enviro500 {{demonstrator}} for long-term loan. It was first loaned to Community Transit between 2007 and 2009 which {{put it into}} service on 1 August 2007, the bus was used on commuter routes between Seattle and various points in Snohomish County during its first year in operation. From September 2010, it was loaned to Strathcona County Transit on a one-year lease for the operator's one-year-long double-decker pilot project. The pilot {{is part of an}} exploration of different high-capacity bus types to carry more passengers on the high-demand commuter routes, which are between Strathcona County and Edmonton; an articulated bus is also being evaluated as an alternative and there is no commitment <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>any</b> Alexander Dennis model or any double-decker design into permanent service. This bus becomes the first double-decker to be used for regular transit service in Alberta.|$|E
25|$|In May, the Tigers were as many {{as eight}} games back of the first-place Cleveland Indians, but slowly pulled back to near-even by the All-Star break. As a {{three-way}} battle for the division title developed between the Tigers, Indians, and Chicago White Sox, the Tigers put together an 18-10 record in August to begin to pull away. After a loss on September 1, the Tigers reeled off a 12-game winning streak <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>any</b> thoughts of another late-season collapse to rest. The streak consisted of four consecutive three-game sweeps over their AL Central Division rivals. It was the Tigers longest winning streak since the 1934 team won 14 straight. On September 16, the Tigers clinched the AL Central Division title with a 3–1 win over the Oakland Athletics. It was their first AL Central title since joining the division in 1998, and first overall since 1987. The Tigers clinched the division with 11 games left to play, tying the franchise record set by the 1984 team.|$|E

As a {{three-way}} battle for the division title developed between the Tigers, Indians, and Chicago White Sox, the Tigers put together an 18–10 record in August to begin to pull away. Starter Doug Fister, acquired via trade on July 30, provided an immediate spark, going 8–1 over the final two months of the season with a sparkling 1.79 ERA.

[...] The negotiations floundered, however, and Ramsgate ultimately had no involvement in the formation of Thanet United F.C. in 1981, {{which turned out to be}} purely a name change for Margate. [...] When Thanet District Council announced that it would not be prepared <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>any</b> funding into Thanet United, the two clubs finally abandoned the idea of a merger.|$|E

500|$|Their first {{original}} game, Alpha Protocol received mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics. It {{was also a}} commercial failure for Sega, which led to their decision <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>any</b> plans for a sequel on hold. After the game's launch, Urquhart admitted that there was still room for improvements. Even though the game was a commercial failure, it was well received by the community, which has often demanded that Obsidian make a sequel. Urquhart responded {{by saying that the}} team hoped that they can develop Alpha Protocol 2, and [...] "do better" [...] with it. Avellone later added that they were unable to develop a sequel because the rights to the game were owned by Sega and crowdfunding would not be a suitable option.|$|E
500|$|Fastow {{disclosed}} to Enron's {{board of directors}} on October 22 that he earned $30 million from compensation arrangements when managing the LJM limited partnerships. That day, the share price of Enron decreased to $20.65, down $5.40 in one day, after the announcement by the SEC that it was investigating several suspicious deals struck by Enron, characterizing them as [...] "some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen". Attempting to explain the billion-dollar charge and calm investors, Enron's disclosures spoke of [...] "share settled costless collar arrangements," [...] "derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted forward contracts," [...] and strategies that served [...] "to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets." [...] Such puzzling phraseology left many analysts feeling ignorant about just how Enron managed its business.

500|$|... "Fight for You" [...] {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics for its catchy production and Derulo's vocal performance. David Griffiths of 4Music {{called it a}} [...] "catchy little ditty" [...] that [...] "is guaranteed to be stuck in your head {{for the rest of}} the day". Shawn Kitchener of Entertainment Wise described the song as [...] "the kind of sweet-as-candy R fodder" [...] that could have been featured on the High School Musical soundtrack. Meena Rupani of DesiHits noted that the song's lyrical theme is similar to [...] "It Girl", and that Derulo's [...] "vocals are enough <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>any</b> girl into a trance". However, [...] "Fight for You" [...] also received unfavorable reviews from critics because of its lack of originality. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song a three out of five star rating, calling Derulo [...] "extremely lazy" [...] for sampling [...] "Africa". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian described the song as [...] "languid", while writing that the sample gives it [...] "a bit of bounce". Although Jess Holton of The Music Network described [...] "Fight for You" [...] as a [...] "touching ballad", she added that sampling [...] "Africa" [...] does not do the latter [...] "any form of justice". In an album review of Future History, Michael Cragg of BBC Music noted that the songs [...] "revolve around the joys of being in a relationship or the pain of not being in one", however disapproved of the lyrical content and sample in [...] "Fight for You", calling it [...] "perhaps the worst offender" [...] on the album.|$|E
500|$|Closing out the year, My Name Is My Name {{was named}} to {{multiple}} [...] "Best Albums of the Year" [...] lists. It was ranked at number 33 on Rolling Stones list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "The cockier half of the Clipse didn't choose to go solo — he had to after his brother found God. Pusha, in turn, found Kanye West, whose stark and twisted production helped make My Name Is My Name feel like a more lyrically focused companion piece to his own Yeezus. It's the year's sharpest hit of street philosophy." [...] Complex named it the third best album of 2013. They elaborated saying, [...] "everything clicks {{because of the way}} it was calculated. The songs benefit from their respective placement beside each other, each track a background for the next. In that way, it brings the Pusha T fan up to speed with what he's evolved into, without leaving them in unfamiliar territory. If you were the reluctant [...] "we want that old Pusha T" [...] fan, then it fed you the teaspoon of updated classic with the medicine of his reinvention—and by the end, you appreciated both sides." [...] Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly named it the eighth best album of 2013 saying, [...] "With these beats — private-stash stuff from the likes of his label boss Kanye West and Pharrell Williams — he could sell fire in hell. In fact, Pusha plumbs his emotional depths, breaking down his parents' divorce after 35 years of marriage and his conflicted feelings about his brother." [...] Exclaim! named it the second best hip hop album of 2013. XXL named it the fourth best album of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "Song for song, it's tough <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>any</b> album in the same category as Pusha's proper solo debut. In the space of a trim 46 minutes, Push coaxed the best verse of Rick Ross' year on [...] "Hold On," [...] made Kendrick Lamar get dark and grim on [...] "Nosetalgia" [...] and even rapped over a beat that seemed impossible to make into a hip-hop track on [...] "King Push," [...] all while keeping his lyricism at the absolute highest level. The worst song on this album could find its way onto a top ten list. If this is what a post-Yeezus world sounds like, sign us up immediately." ...|$|E
