A MEDLINE, Cochrane database and a hand search was performed on human randomized placebo controlled trials using probiotics in the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>periodontal</b> disease. A total of thirteen papers which addressed the question of the use of probiotics in the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>periodontal</b> disease were retrieved. Most of the studies reviewed showed only a short term benefit with regards to reduction in gingival inflammation and probing depth reduction.

40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has {{historically}} {{been used as a}} means to treat cancerous tumors but has recently been used to kill bacterial cells through the use of targeted photosensitizers. PDT is a potential adjunct to scaling and root planing in the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>periodontal</b> disease. However, the effectiveness of porphyrin derivatives against microorganisms has been limited because some gram-negative bacteria are refractory to photodynamic treatment with these agents. We have designed a porphyrin derivative conjugated to a pental-ysine moeity that endows the molecule with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Whereas the porphyrin, chlorin e 6, showed in vitro activity against a limited spectrum of bacteria, chlorin e 6 conjugated to pentalysine showed in vitro activity against all oral microorganisms tested, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, Actinomyces viscosus, and the streptococci.

40|$|M. Pharm., Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, 2011 Periodontal disease {{describes}} a chronic bacterial infection affecting the gums and bone supporting the teeth. Bacteria present in plaque produce toxins, {{which lead to}} a cascade of inflammatory events that if left untreated may lead to permanent tooth loss. A periodontal pocket forms when the free gingiva {{moves away from the}} tooth surface. Periodontal disease is prevalent worldwide and has risk factors such as HIV and diabetes with possible links to socio-economic status. This places {{a large portion of the}} South African population at risk in an already burdened health care system. Scaling and root planning (SRP) forms the keystone <b>of</b> <b>periodontal</b> therapy, involving the removal of calculus and plaque. Multiple clinical trials have proved SRP leads to improved clinical outcomes. However, it often leaves behind microorganisms leading to recolonisation. Administration of pharmacological therapy is used in combination with SRP delivering one or more drugs. Subgingival <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>periodontal</b> disease involves the placement of a drug delivery device within the periodontal pocket releasing model drugs over a prolonged period of time. Targeted drug delivery devices have been the focus <b>of</b> <b>periodontal</b> research over the past two decades. To date there are no commercially available local drug delivery devices in South Africa for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>periodontal</b> disease. The aim of this study was to design, formulate and evaluate (in vitro) a novel polymeric fibre system to locally deliver an antimicrobial and an anti-inflammatory drug over 10 days to the periodontal pocket for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>periodontal</b> disease. The design of a flexible fibre would easily fit within the periodontal pocket evenly delivering the model drugs to the affected site. Alginate combined with glycerol was crosslinked with barium cations forming a monolithic fibre incorporating ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium, as the model antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents respectively.
