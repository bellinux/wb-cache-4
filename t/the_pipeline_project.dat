5|$|The Teamsters Union {{was by far}} {{the largest}} and most notable {{contributor}} of workers to <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>project.</b> Teamsters worked in the transportation and supply aspects of the project. All trucks were driven by Teamsters, supply warehouses were run by Teamsters, and the buses that transported workers from camps to job sites were run by Teamsters. Teamsters Local 959, with more than 23,000 employees at its peak, {{was by far the}} most dominant labor force on <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>project.</b> There were frequent allegations of corruption by Teamsters on the project, and the Anchorage Daily News won a Pulitzer Prize for a 15-part series on the rise of Local 959 and its influence on state politics. Repeated allegations of links to organized crime were never backed up by evidence, but two Teamsters leaders were murdered in 1976 while investigating drug activity on <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>project.</b> Teamsters workers strongly denied any involvement with organized crime, and pointed to the fact that 80 percent of the Teamsters in the project had college degrees or professional and management experience.|$|E
5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced opposition to <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>project</b> before 1970, {{the introduction of}} the National Environmental Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project. Arctic engineers had raised concerns about the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E
5|$|Hearings in {{both the}} U.S. Senate and the House {{continued}} through the summer of 1973 on both new bills and amendments to the Mineral Leasing Act. On July 13, an amendment calling for more study of the project—the Mondale-Bayh Amendment—was defeated. This was followed by another victory for pipeline proponents when an amendment by Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel {{was passed by the}} Senate. The amendment declared that <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>project</b> fulfilled all aspects of NEPA and modified the Mineral Leasing Act to allow the larger right-of-way for the Alaska pipeline. Upon reconsideration, the vote was tied at 49–49 and required the vote of vice president Spiro Agnew, who supported the amendment. A similar amendment was passed in the House on August 2.|$|E

5|$|Howe was {{determined}} that the pipeline not be delayed, and proposed that the government advance money to the pipeline company to ensure construction in 1956. He emotionally pleaded with his Cabinet colleagues, who agreed both to the proposal and {{to the use of}} rarely used closure to limit the debate. Closure had not been applied in the House since 1932. The issue was attractive to the Tories and CCF with an election due within two years; it would allow them to portray Howe as an arrogant dictator, and play to those citizens who disliked the American involvement in <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>project.</b> If the bill did not receive Royal Assent by 7 June 1956, options that Trans-Canada held for steel pipe would expire.|$|E
5|$|Raphel was {{instrumental}} in coordinating the State Department's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Taliban shortly after its takeover of Kabul. A senior Unocal executive commented that <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>project</b> would be far easier to implement with the Taliban in control, {{in reference to the}} need for central control in Afghanistan to undertake a project of the size, complexity and cost the Texas-based oil giant was considering. Unocal's consortium also included Saudi Arabia's Delta Oil, Pakistan's Crescent Group and Gazprom of Russia. The project involved building an 890-kilometer gas pipeline that would carry 1.9 billion cubic feet of gas to Pakistan each day. Unocal held detailed discussions with Taliban representatives in Houston in December 1997, striking a deal that would later collapse under the weight of rising U.S. and Afghan domestic political pressures against the Taliban's record on human rights, education and treatment of women.|$|E
5|$|The Big Inch and Little Big Inch, collectively {{known as}} the Inch pipelines, are {{petroleum}} pipelines extending from Texas to New Jersey, built between 1942 and 1944 as emergency war measures in the U.S. Before World War II, petroleum products were transported from the oil fields of Texas to the north-eastern states by sea by oil tankers. After the United States entered the war on 1 January 1942, this vital link was attacked by German submarines in the Operation Paukenschlag, threatening both the oil supplies to the north-east and its onward transshipment to Great Britain. The Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes, championed <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>project</b> {{as a way of}} transporting petroleum by the more-secure, interior route.|$|E

5|$|The welders {{who worked}} on the {{pipeline}} itself came from Pipeliners Local 798 out of Tulsa, Oklahoma, which specialize in providing welders for large-scale pipeline projects. Members of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing, Pipefitting and Sprinkler Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada performed all welding that was {{not a part of the}} pipeline itself, including pump stations, feeder pipelines, and work at the Valdez Marine Terminal. The welders were the highest paid of all the workers on the pipeline, with a normal rate of $18.25 per hour. To be hired on <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>project,</b> welders had to go through an intensive certification process that involved a series of test welds. If a welder failed any of the test welds, he was not hired and was not allowed to try again for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{supported}} <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>project</b> {{even before}} the oil crisis. On September 10, 1973, he released a message stating that the pipeline was his priority {{for the remainder of}} the Congressional session that year. On November 8, after the embargo had been in place for three weeks, he reaffirmed that statement. Members of Congress, under pressure from their constituents, created the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, which removed all legal barriers from construction of the pipeline, provided financial incentives, and granted a right-of-way for its construction. The act was drafted, rushed through committee, and approved by the House on November 12, 1973, by a vote of 361–14–60. The next day, the Senate passed it, 80–5–15. Nixon signed it into law on November 16, and a federal right-of-way for the pipeline and transportation highway was granted on January 3, 1974. The deal was signed by the oil companies on January 23, allowing work to start.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>project</b> costs $3.78billion, {{of which}} $2.5billion has been financed by loans, {{while the rest}} of the capital would be raised by the sale of a 49% stake in Dakota Access, LLC (36.8% {{indirect}} stake in the pipeline) to Enbridge and Marathon Petroleum. The loans have been provided by a group of 17banks, including Citibank, Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Mizuho Bank, TD Securities, ABN AMRO Capital, ING Bank, DNB ASA, ICBC, SMBC Nikko Securities and Société Générale.|$|E
25|$|The former Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schröder, and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, {{were strong}} advocates of <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>project</b> during the {{negotiation}} phase. International media alluded to a past {{relationship between the}} Managing Director of Nord Stream AG, Matthias Warnig, himself a former East German secret police officer, and Vladimir Putin {{when he was a}} KGB agent in East Germany. These allegations were denied by Matthias Warning, who said that he had met Vladimir Putin {{for the first time in}} his life in 1991, when Putin was the head of the Committee for External Relations of the Saint Petersburg Mayor's Office.|$|E
25|$|The {{agreement}} {{to build the}} pipeline was signed ten days before the German parliamentary election. On 24 October 2005, {{a few weeks before}} Schröder had stepped down as Chancellor, the German government guaranteed to cover €1billion of the Nord Stream project cost, should Gazprom default on a loan. However, this guarantee expired at the end of 2006 without ever having been needed. Soon after leaving the post of Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schröder agreed to head the shareholders' committee of Nord Stream AG. This has been widely described by German and international media as a conflict of interest, the implication being that <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>project</b> may have been pushed through for personal gain rather than for improving gas supplies to Germany. Information about the German government's guarantee was requested by the European Commission. No formal charges have been filed against any party despite years of exhaustive investigations.|$|E

The pipeline company {{wanted the}} Government {{to guarantee the}} loans needed to build what would {{become known as the}} Trans-Canada Pipeline, but Cabinet refused, fearful of the political implications of giving a large sum of government money to a US-dominated corporation. Howe was embittered by this decision, and grumbled that he was now part of [...] "a government which has fallen into the hands of children". [...] A solution was proposed by Howe's deputy minister, Mitchell Sharp: [...] the Government and the province of Ontario would themselves build the most expensive part of the route, in Northern Ontario, to be reimbursed by Trans-Canada once the pipeline was open for business. This was approved by both governments. By 1956, however, further difficulties had arisen: [...] until the US government granted formal approval for a part of the route which connected to US pipelines, Trans-Canada could not raise enough money to build its portion. The approval was a matter of routine, but the delay would mean that construction on the pipeline could not begin until the spring of 1957.|$|E
