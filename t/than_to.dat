5|$|Aware {{that the}} public {{appreciated}} instrumental music with context, Liszt provided written prefaces for nine of his symphonic poems. However, Liszt's view of the symphonic poem tended to be evocative, using music to create a general mood or atmosphere rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> illustrate a narrative or describe something literally. In this regard, Liszt authority Humphrey Searle suggests {{that he may have}} been closer to his contemporary Hector Berlioz <b>than</b> <b>to</b> many who would follow him in writing symphonic poems.|$|E

40|$|Let M(m, n) be {{the minimum}} number of {{comparators}} needed in a comparator network that merges m elements x(1) less <b>than</b> or equal <b>to</b> x(2) less <b>than</b> or equal <b>to</b> [...] . less <b>than</b> or equal <b>to</b> x(m) and n elements y(1) less <b>than</b> or equal <b>to</b> y(2) less <b>than</b> or equal <b>to</b> [...] . less <b>than</b> or equal <b>to</b> y(n), where n greater <b>than</b> or equal <b>to</b> m. Batcher's odd-even merge yields the following upper bound: M(m,n) less <b>than</b> or equal <b>to</b> 1 / 2 (m + n) log(2) m + O(n); in particular, M(n,n) less <b>than</b> or equal <b>to</b> n log(2) n + O(n).

Our proof technique extends to give similarly tight Lower bounds for the size of monotone Boolean circuits for merging, and for the size of switching networks capable of realizing the set of permutations that arise from merging. ...|$|R

40|$|We employ chaotic (phi(2) and phi(4)) {{inflation}} {{to illustrate}} the important role radiative corrections can play during the inflationary phase. Yukawa interactions of phi, in particular, lead to corrections of the form -k phi(4) ln(phi/mu), where K > 0 and mu is a renormalization scale. For instance, phi(4) chaotic inflation with radiative corrections looks compatible with the most recent WMAP (5 year) analysis, {{in sharp contrast to}} the tree level case.

5|$|More recently, a 2007 {{analysis}} by paleontologist William G. Parker {{resulted in a}} larger tree of aetosaur phylogenetics with the inclusion of Heliocanthus. Based on the tree, Parker defined the clades Typothoracisinae and Paratypothoracisini, both within Aetosaurinae. Parker also gave a revised phylogenetic definition of Aetosauria, mentioning that the previous definition, made by Heckert and Lucas in 2000, was somewhat ambiguous. Heckert & Lucas (2000) defined Aetosauria as a stem-based taxon, claiming that Aetosauria included all crurotarsans that were {{more closely related to}} Desmatosuchus <b>than</b> <b>to</b> the immediate sister group of Aetosauria. Because the immediate sister group of Aetosauria was uncertain, Parker offered a new definition with several non-aetosaur crurotarsan genera rather than one sister group. According to Parker, Aetosauria included all taxa more closely related to Aetosaurus and Desmatosuchus <b>than</b> <b>to</b> Leptosuchus, Postosuchus, Prestosuchus, Poposaurus, Sphenosuchus, Alligator, Gracilisuchus, and Revueltosaurus.|$|E
