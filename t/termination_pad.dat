40|$|Recently, {{open circuit}} {{failures}} of individual elements in thin film resistor networks {{have been attributed}} to electrostatic discharge (ESD) effects. This paper will discuss the investigation that came to this conclusion and subsequent experimentation intended to characterize design factors that affect the sensitivity of resistor elements to ESD. The ESD testing was performed using the standard human body model simulation. Some of the design elements to be evaluated were: trace width, trace length (and thus width to length ratio), specific resistivity of the trace (ohms per square) and resistance value. However, once the experiments were in progress, it was realized that the ESD sensitivity of most of the complex patterns under evaluation was determined by other design and process factors such as trace shape and <b>termination</b> <b>pad</b> spacing. This paper includes pictorial examples of representative ESD failure sites, and provides some options for designing thin film resistors that are ESD resistant. The risks of ESD damage are assessed and handling precautions suggested...|$|E

The variety of surface mount device (SMD) <b>terminations,</b> solder <b>pad</b> shape and surface properties, soldering processes, and properties of solder pastes currently leads to ill-understood and ad hoc methods of specifying component terminations, joint geometry, and soldering parameters and to the consequent risk of reduced process yields for SMD-to-printed-circuit-board connections. The authors attempt to relate the design and process variables to their effects on final joint quality and production process stability. It is pointed out that the migration of manufacturers from vapor-phase to infrared (IR) reflow soldering has gone some way to reduce the occurrences of many of the reflow soldering defects. However, despite the improvement provided with the IR reflow technique, any gains in reducing the number of occurrences per joint of these defects will to a large extent be counteracted by the significant increase in interconnections expected in the near future...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve a {{reduction}} in solderability related defects on electronic components and Printed Circuit Board’s (PCB’s) in electronics manufacturing, preventive controls such as “Dip & Look” and “Wetting Balance” solderability testing need to be fully optimised to screen out all poor soldering components and PCB’s. Components and PCB’s that pass these tests should solder correctly in volume production. This thesis initially investigates the variations and effects of the Dip & Look solderability test on components and PCB’s. Data from this analysis proved {{that no matter how}} extreme the oxidisation on the component <b>termination</b> or PCB <b>pad,</b> the visual inspection criteria of 95 % solder coverage is achieved each time. Dip & Look testing therefore serves no useful purpose to the electronics mass manufacturer in determining the solderability of a component or PCB. The second option available to screen components is the Wetting Balance Test. Due to the variation of parameter settings within the international standards for solder temperature, immersion speed, immersion depth, removal speed and dwell time, a complete analysis was required to determine the optimum settings for the MUST II Wetting Balance machine that would detect poor soldering components. The test specifications vary considerably between all the international standards. Design of Experiments conducted an in-depth analysis to determine the optimum Wetting Balance test settings using the range of test specifications stated within the standards. Within the range of specifications the least stringent and most stringent settings were developed which highlighted the difference in results when testing at the lower end and higher end of the current international standards. Prediction models were generated for each of the responses (Ta, Tb, Fmax, TFmax, F 1 and F 2) using Wetting Balance machine parameters solder temperature, immersion speed and immersion depth. To test these models, components with a history of solderability issues were tested and evaluated using the least stringent and most stringent settings. XRF measurements were conducted to ensure uniform plating thickness. Both components passed the Wetting Balance test criteria generated by the model equations using the least stringent settings but failed when using the most stringent settings. The current industrial specification for Ta (< 0. 6 seconds) and Tb (< 1 second) were also achieved on both components even though the components had known soldering issues on a series production line. It was proven that there was a 40 % difference in the Ta and Tb values when testing {{at the lower end of}} the international specification as opposed to testing at the higher end of the specification, which questioned the spread on the tolerance of the parameter settings within the current international standards. It was established through experimentation that the current F 1 criteria, which states no less than 50 % of Fmax, must be reviewed based on the analysis carried out in this thesis. To ensure completeness a component with no soldering issues was also tested using the same procedure. This component passed the Wetting Balance test using the least stringent and most stringent settings illustrating that the settings derived through this research are robust to detect good and poor soldering components. This research has developed an alternative set of Wetting Balance test specifications and has defined new model equations that will predict the Wetting Balance responses such as Ta, Tb, Fmax, TFmax, F 1 and F 2, which will result in components which are deemed acceptable under international and industrial standards...|$|R
