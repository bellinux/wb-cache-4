5|$|For {{the next}} nine months, Quisling {{continued}} to lead a party that was at best peripheral to Norwegian politics. He was nonetheless active, and in October 1939 he worked with Prytz on an ultimately unsuccessful plan for peace between Britain, France and Germany and their eventual participation in a new economic union. Quisling also mused on how Germany ought {{to go on the}} offensive against its then-ally the Soviet Union, and on 9 December travelled to Germany to present his multi-faceted plans. After impressing German officials, he won an audience with Hitler himself, scheduled for 14 December, whereupon he received firm advice from his contacts that the most useful <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do would be to ask for Hitler's help with a pro-German coup in Norway, that would let the Germans use Norway as a naval base. Thereafter, Norway would maintain official neutrality as long as possible, and finally the country would fall under German rather than British control. It is not clear how much Quisling himself understood about the strategic implications of such a move, and he instead relied on his future Minister of Domestic Affairs, Albert Hagelin, who was fluent in German, to put the relevant arguments to German officials in Berlin during pre-meeting talks, even though Hagelin was prone to damaging exaggeration at times. Quisling and his German contacts almost certainly went away with different views as to whether they had agreed upon the necessity of a German invasion.|$|E
25|$|After {{being called}} Kid Apocalypse by Kid Omega, Evan begins {{learning}} about Apocalypse and is saddened {{that he himself}} looks like the villain, raising {{the possibility of a}} future that Evan rejects. After saving Angel and discovering that he possesses the ability to see the essence of those he looks upon, Evan asks him to tell him what he sees when he looks at him. Angel tells En he sees only goodness inside him, which makes Evan happy, so he thanks Angel for being a good friend. In fact, Angel lied, as the only <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see was the dark image of Apocalypse.|$|E
25|$|There are early {{hints that}} Seishirō {{may not be}} all that he appears. Hokuto jokes about him {{being a member of}} the family of Sakurazukamori, a clan of assassins who use onmyōjitsu to kill, and are {{pronounced}} to be the Sumeragis' opposite. Also, Subaru has dreams about having met someone under a cherry tree blooming out of season when he was but a small child, but he cannot quite recall what was being said. This person was actually Seishirō, upon whom Subaru stumbled when he had just performed a kill. According to the rules of the Sakurazukamori, Seishirō should have killed him, but impressed with the child's purity, he made a bet with him instead: He would meet Subaru again, and would then spend one year with him, protecting him and trying to love him. If, at the end of that year, he felt something for Subaru which distinguished him from a <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> easily destroy, as he could not with any other person, then he would not kill him. To recognize him, he marked him with inverted pentagrams on both hands, the sign of the Sakurazukamori's prey. These marks are for most of the story hidden beneath the gloves Subaru continually wears on the direction of his grandmother, the previous family head, who recognized the marks and so hopes to conceal them with her magic.|$|E

500|$|Labyrinth was {{featured}} in music trade papers such as Billboard due to David Bowie's soundtrack for the film. Bowie was not heavily involved in promoting the film, but Jim Henson was nonetheless grateful that he produced a music video to accompany the song [...] "Underground" [...] from the soundtrack, saying, [...] "I think it's the best <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have done for the film." [...] Ted Coconis produced a one-sheet poster for the film's North American release.|$|E
500|$|Paul {{became a}} {{follower}} of the music of Woody Guthrie during the early 1990s. [...] In a 1998 Boston Globe article, Paul refers to a tattoo of Woody Guthrie on his right shoulder saying that Woody's image was the only <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> put on his body that would be [...] "like a badge of who he was." [...] Paul's tattoo of Woody Guthrie resulted in a chance meeting with Nora Guthrie, Woody Guthrie's daughter, at a Folk Alliance Conference when Nora asked to see Paul's tattoo. [...] That chance meeting resulted in Paul being invited to perform at a Woody Guthrie tribute show at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. [...] The 10-day celebration, held in September 1996, included other notable musicians such as Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, The Indigo Girls and Ani DiFranco. [...] DiFranco's record label, Righteous Babe, released a compilation of the event, Til We Outnumber 'Em, in 2000.|$|E
500|$|During {{the debate}} on Howe's war {{spending}} estimates in 1945 (which totalled $1.365billion), Howe answered an Opposition question on whether such a large sum could be reduced: [...] "I dare say my honourable friend could cut a million dollars from that amount, but a million dollars from the War Appropriations Bill {{would not be a}} very important matter." [...] Saskatchewan Tory MP John Diefenbaker spoke the following day, and alleged that Howe had said, [...] "We may save a million dollars, but what of it?" [...] Howe angrily denied the quote, accusing Diefenbaker of being [...] "a past master of distortion"—language he was forced to withdraw as unparliamentary. Diefenbaker sharpened the anecdote over time, and it emerged in its final form as Howe saying, [...] "What's a million?" [...] Even Liberals who knew that Howe had made no such statement agreed that it was just the sort of <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have said. [...] In the years to come, [...] "What's a million?" [...] would be a mocking Tory attack on the Liberals, most often directed at Howe.|$|E

500|$|In {{writing a}} musical about film making in Hollywood, Sparks were also {{informed}} {{by their own}} past film projects. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, they had spent six years {{trying to get their}} film Mai, the Psychic Girl produced. Based on a Japanese manga comic, the film was at one time supposed to be directed by Tim Burton. Although the music had been completed, the film failed to materialise, an experience that coloured their portrayal of the studio head in The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman. Earlier, Sparks had worked with French director Jacques Tati on Confusion, another film project that remained uncompleted. Having had numerous meetings with Tati {{over the course of a}} year, they were aware that, like other great European directors, Tati had been wooed by Hollywood: [...] "He showed me a letter from Paramount", Ron Mael recalled. [...] "He said: 'Oooh! They take me to Hollywood and they have a limousine for me.' But it was kind of mocking of the whole similar situation to our fantasy Bergman <b>thing.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> see Hollywood for what it was." ...|$|E

2500|$|Napoleon {{asked his}} Minister of the Interior, Jean-Antoine Chaptal, {{what would be}} the most useful <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do for Paris, and Chaptal replied, [...] "Give it water.". [...] In 1802 Napoleon ordered the {{construction}} of the first canal bringing [...] water from a river outside the city, the canal d'Ourcq. [...] The canal was built by Napoleon's energetic Chief Engineer of Bridges and Highways and head of his service of water and sewers, Pierre Simon Girard, who had served with him on his campaign in Egypt. [...] Girard's grand projects included the Canal Saint-Denis (finished in 1821), the Canal d'Ourcq (finished in 1822), the Canal Saint-Martin (finished in 1825) which brought enough water for both drinking fountains and decorative fountains.|$|E

They say they only told investigators he sometimes jotted down nonsense he called writing, and they seriously question McCormick's capacity to craft the notes found in his pockets." [...] His mother, Frankie Sparks, said [...] "The only <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> write was his name. ... He didn't write in no code." [...] His father, Charles McCormick, said Ricky [...] "couldn't spell anything, just scribble." [...] It was also noted that although other contents of the victim's pockets were revealed to the family members, they {{knew nothing about the}} notes [...] "until the local evening news broadcast a report on the codes" [...] twelve years later.|$|E
2500|$|Kamaal/The Abstract {{contains}} introspective lyrical themes. Opening {{with the}} album's only rock chord, the opening track [...] "Feelin' It" [...] {{is one of}} the album's few tracks with him rapping and it contains one verse about common life experiences and hassles. It introduces Q-Tip {{on his way to a}} recording studio, during which he is stopped by a police officer who profiles him: [...] "This profiling cop with his profiling ass / Figured the best <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do was find a cat to harass. / The little kitten was me, not that one in the tree / The black one with the promise and the wish to be free". The lyrics are based on an experience that Q-Tip had with a policeman. John Murph of Jazz Times interpreted the song's verse as a metaphor for Q-Tip's struggles for absolute creative freedom without resulting in critical backlash. Tiny Mix Tapess Brendan Mahoney interpreted the [...] "profilin' cop" [...] in the song as [...] "another mundane and too-predictable distraction in a world full of them".|$|E
2500|$|Max has {{a history}} of cheating, which Inside Soap said would make him the most obvious person, but as he has {{recently}} reunited with his former wife Tanya Jessop (Jo Joyner), it would be the worst <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do. However, the magazine said that [...] "Max thrives on passion and deceipt, so getting it on with Kat behind Tanya's back would be consistent." [...] They also said he was busy with his own problems, but had form finding Slater (Kat's maiden name) women irresistible (he had an affair with Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) years earlier). They said Kat's fiery personality would appeal to Max and [...] "he loves illicit liaisons with unsuitable partners". They felt he was bound to mess up his relationship with Tanya, but thought it would more likely be something else that would do that. Soaplife said Max was [...] "least likely even though he has the track record and the matching morals of an alley cat." [...] Actor Wood had previously promised a big storyline for Max, but Soaplife did not think this would be it. Soaplife later ruled out Max, asking [...] "why would he go for hamburger (Kat) when he has steak (Tanya) at home?" [...] All About Soap called Max a [...] "love rat", but doubted that he would cheat on Tanya again, but as it's Max, [...] "all bets are off {{when it comes to the}} bedroom", and said he was the second most likely suspect. In September 2012, Richie said he thought that Max was the most likely suspect, saying [...] "I think it's Max. You can't trust him!" [...] Wood stated that [...] "It would definitely be in keeping with Max for him to be having an affair. He's got a chequered history and women are his Achilles heel. So it would make a lot of sense for it to be him. It would be bad timing, though, because he's planning to get remarried!" ...|$|E
