5|$|As a rationalist and ardent social reformer, Periyar {{advocated}} forcefully {{throughout his}} life that women should be given their legitimate position in society as the equals of men {{and that they should}} be given good education and have the right to property. He thought age and social customs was not a bar in marrying women. He was keen that women should realise <b>their</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> be worthy citizens of their country.|$|E
5|$|Many {{migrant workers}} have little education, little {{knowledge}} {{of the law and}} <b>their</b> <b>rights,</b> <b>and</b> leave home to support their families. They fall victim to agents (official and unofficial), unscrupulous officials and a lack of legal protection at home and in their host countries. The debts they incur to secure employment overseas may lock them in a cycle of abuse and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is based primarily on the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If a defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a defendant is not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of <b>their</b> <b>rights,</b> <b>and</b> their statements may still be admissible.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the last}} use {{of the death penalty}} in Spain; {{following}} the death of Francisco Franco, two months later, no further executions took place.

5|$|Economic {{conditions}} in 1817 {{led to a}} group who became known as Blanketeers to organise a march from Manchester to London so they could petition the Prince Regent for parliamentary reform. A crowd of 25,000 including 5,000 men who intended to march gathered in St Peter's Fields. After the magistrates read the Riot Act, the crowd was dispersed by the King's Dragoon Guards. The ringleaders were arrested and subsequently released when serious charges against them were not forthcoming. In April 1819 three leading Blanketeers were convicted of sedition and conspiracy when witnesses alleged they had advocated the principal towns of the kingdom should elect representatives to a National Convention to demand <b>their</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> if refused enforce them 'sword in hand' during a meeting in Stockport in September 1818.|$|E
5|$|Looking Forward is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Adapted from James Oliver Curwood's short story of the same name, the film follows a young chemist named Jack Goodwin. He discovers a chemical compound that puts a person {{into a state of}} sleep for a determined period of time and decides to test it upon himself. The first test is a success and Jack makes arrangements for his sleep of a hundred years, in a state similar to suspended animation. When he awakes in 2010 into a world ruled by women, he woos the female mayor. Jack joins a society to campaign for men's rights. The society ends up before the female mayor who jails all of them, save for Jack who she proposes to. Jack accepts on the condition that men are given back <b>their</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> she accepts. The cast and production credits of the film are not known, but Theodore Marston was not the director. The film was released on December 20, 1910. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The Hanoverian {{succession}} to {{the throne}} of Great Britain led to reigns with less ceremony than in any since the incorporation of the heralds. The only notable incident for the college in this period, {{during the reign of}} George I, happened in 1727 when an impostor called Robert Harman pretended to be a herald. The knave was prosecuted by the College in the county of Suffolk, and was sentenced to be pilloried in several market towns on public market days and afterwards to be imprisoned and pay a fine. This hefty sentence was executed, proving that the rights of the College were still respected. In 1737, during the reign of George II the College petitioned for another charter, to reaffirm <b>their</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> remuneration; this effort proved unsuccessful. Apart from these events the influence of the College was greatly diminished.|$|E
