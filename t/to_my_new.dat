The photograph is the original full-length version of the cropped image used {{on the cover}} of the Janet album, shot by Patrick Demarchelier. In the cover story, [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] by David Ritz, Jackson explained, [...] "sex has been an important part of me for several years. But it just hasn't blossomed publicly until now. I've had to go through some changes and shed some old attitudes before feeling completely comfortable with my body. Listening <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>new</b> record, people intuitively understand the change in me". Ritz likened Jackson's transformation to Marvin Gaye as he stated, [...] " [...] just as Gaye moved from What's Going On to Let's Get It On, from the austere to the ecstatic, Janet, every bit as serious-minded as Marvin, moved from Rhythm Nation to Janet, her statement of sexual liberation".|$|E
500|$|Regarding the video, Madonna said it {{was like}} [...] "oody goody gum drops", {{referring}} to the candy-oriented theme of the album. Virginia Heffernan from The New York Times called the video heart-pounding, and compared its momentum with the music video of [...] "Thriller, [...] "In the Air Tonight" [...] and [...] "Shadows of the Night". However, Eric Wilson from the same newspaper commented that the video did not yield a breakout Madonna look compared to her videos from the 1980s.

Madonna responded to it in her own video and said, [...] "All you {{people out there who are}} making videos <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>new</b> single, '4 Minutes,' keep up the good work, nice job." [...] "4 Minutes" [...] was nominated for an award at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards in the [...] "Best Dancing in a Video" [...] category, but lost to the Pussycat Dolls' single [...] "When I Grow Up".|$|E
2500|$|Bird {{said his}} {{victory in the}} sprint race felt [...] "fantastic", [...] "Being back in GP2 is already feeling very good, being back in the feeder series to Formula One {{is a great place}} to be. To win for RUSSIAN TIME after only four races of {{existence}} is a very good feeling." [...] He believed that he may have pushed too hard at the wrong time in the race, [...] "it was just a case of keeping it on the racing line and hoping they'd battle it out behind me. Felipe's car was like a rocket at the end. Big thanks <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>new</b> team: to win in our fourth race, with no pre-season testing, is amazing." [...] Nasr spoke about car management and maintaining the pace levels with the leaders and believed he could have won in an alternative situation, [...] "But anyway, it’s still a good result. We came here to score big points and it’s quite good to go back to Europe knowing that we have a good car, a good team. It keeps getting better and better. I’m feeling quite confident." [...] Coletti believed his third-place finish contributed towards [...] "a good weekend" [...] for himself. He stated that entering the European leg of the season as the points leader had gave him additional motivation and hoped to be competing at the front of the field in Barcelona, [...] "We’re still a few points ahead – ten I think. But like I said, we need to score big points in Race 1 and I think that in Barcelona we’ll be in the front." ...|$|E
