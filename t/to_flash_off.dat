50|$|The metal {{blowdown}} tank, a cylindrical {{device with}} a vent pipe, {{is connected to}} the boiler, located about 7 metres west of the southernmost corner of the boiler. The blowdown tank was used to flush sediment out of the boiler under pressure, by allowing the steam <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> <b>off</b> up the vent pipe while the hot water drained away.|$|E
50|$|Large ships usually carry {{evaporating}} {{plants to}} produce fresh water, thus reducing their reliance on shore-based supplies. Steam ships {{must be able}} to produce high-quality distillate in order to maintain boiler-water levels. Diesel-engined ships often utilise waste heat as an energy source for producing fresh water. In this system, the engine-cooling water is passed through a heat exchanger, where it is cooled by concentrated seawater (brine). Because the cooling water (which is chemically treated fresh water) is at a temperature of 70 - 80 C, it would not be possible <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> <b>off</b> any water vapour unless the pressure in the heat exhanger vessel was dropped.|$|E
40|$|The liquid {{carried by}} the {{combined}} drain system mainly contains water, heavy liquid hydrocarbons and mixed light end hydrocarbon gas (VOC) /Acid Gas (e. g. H 2 S mixture). The liquid was routed to a small horizontal pressure vessel to flash-off trapped gas and carryover oil is skimmed in an open sump downstream of the vessel. Increased flow rate to the close drain flash system has decreased the retention time and thus results in adequate flashing of lighter hydrocarbons and acid gas from the closed drain influent coming into the old vessel. This has created a potential environment and safety hazard for the people working around that vessel when the flashing of residual hydrocarbon and acid gas occurs in the sump, which is open to atmosphere. The mitigation of the problem involved designing a large horizontal tank with a heating coil and oil separation chamber, which can provide adequate retention time for the VOC/acid gas <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> <b>off</b> from the influent liquid. The oil chamber will collect hydrocarbon-oil after the de-emulsification process. Mechanical agitation, by using the desanding nozzle, prevents accumulation of sand {{at the bottom of}} the vessel. The project aims at the prevention of the carryover oil with outlet water into the biological process reactor downstream of the new tank. The accumulated oil is analyzed. The oil sample contains species similar to light crude oil. Economic analysis is performed to estimate the revenue obtained from the disposal of spent oil to a third party carrier...|$|E

50|$|The {{flash head}} can swivel up (to 90°), right (to 90°) and left (to 180°).

40|$|Flash {{memory is}} a {{semiconductor}} memory technology that has interesting price, performance, and semantic tradeoffs. We have developed Gordon, a general-purpose persistence system for Standard ML that uses Flash mapped into the virtual address space as its stable storage medium. Flash supports a write-once/bulk-erase interface {{that makes it}} difficult to support update-inplace semantics. In addition, Flash chips are only guaranteed to survive a limited number of erase cycles. Gordon has been designed to overcome these difficulties, and our performance analysis demonstrates good performance and reasonable lifetimes for appropriate application domains. 1 Introduction Flash RAM is a semiconductor memory that offers interesting new price, performance, and semantic tradeoffs for providing persistent memory in computer systems.

5000|$|The {{wristbands}} {{themselves are}} constructed of a thick fabric with LEDs inside the fabric. A radio receiver is located within {{a plastic case}} on the band, and it receives wireless signals from a controller. These signals are sent either by a handheld TV remote styled controller, which has a range of 250 meters, or a controller which is hosted on a laptop computer linked to a radio transmitter, which can remotely control the bands from up to 300 meters away. [...] The operator of the controller or laptop software may program all wristbands or only those of certain colors <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> on and <b>off</b> at specific intervals and specific moments.

40|$|Light Entropy is an {{installation}} and performance exploring ideas around decay, synaesthesia and chaos. The {{work has been}} developed around an original sound and light installation (Tiny Moments) by David Strang and built into a performance via the collaboration between David and Sean Williams. Small light bulbs are frozen inside blocks of ice and hung at various points around a dark space. Beneath each block of ice is a metal bowl suspended in the space that catches each droplet of water as it falls. As a droplet of water hits the bowl it triggers the corresponding light <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> on then <b>off.</b> The water droplet is also amplified through speakers in the space. What is created here is a network of synchronised flashes of light and pulses of sound that adjust to the surrounding environment. Along with the light bulb, small contact mics are frozen in the blocks of ice to amplify the changing state of the ice as it cracks and releases small pockets of air...|$|R
50|$|The Super {{shared a}} new General Motors C-body with the Roadmaster {{but on a}} shorter wheelbase. It {{featured}} three chrome VentiPorts on each front fender to denote its smaller straight-eight engine and shorter engine compartment {{when compared with the}} Roadmaster. The sales brochure noted that VentiPorts helped ventilate the engine compartment, and possibly that was true in early 1949, but sometime during the model year they became plugged. The idea for VentiPorts grew out of a modification Buick styling chief Ned Nickles had added to his own 1948 Roadmaster. He had installed four amber lights on each side of his car’s hood wired to the distributor so as <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> on and <b>off</b> as each piston fired simulating the flames from the exhaust stack of a fighter airplane. Combined with the bombsight mascot, VentiPorts put the driver at the controls of an imaginary fighter airplane. Upon seeing this, Buick chief Harlow Curtice was so delighted that he ordered that (non-lighting) VentiPorts be installed on all 1949 Buicks.|$|R

5000|$|An {{occulting}} light is a rhythmic light {{in which the}} duration of light in each period is longer than the total duration of darkness. In other words, it is the opposite <b>to</b> a <b>flashing</b> light where the total duration of darkness is longer than the duration of light. It has the appearance of <b>flashing</b> <b>off,</b> rather than <b>flashing</b> on. Like a flashing light, {{it can be used}} for a single {{occulting light}} that exhibits only a single period of darkness or the periods of darkness can be grouped and repeated at regular intervals (abbreviated [...] "Oc"), a group (Oc (3)) or a composite group (Oc (2+1)).|$|R

2500|$|The Roadmaster {{received}} its first major postwar restyling in 1949. Its wheelbase and overall length were reduced but its weight was actually marginally increased.

While awake, Rei moves about her home, interacting with other characters and developing photographs taken from the Manor of Sleep. While sleeping, Rei enters the Manor of Sleep in her dreams. In certain Hours, the player controls either Miku or Kei, and their dreams include sections from previous games (e.g. the Himuro Mansion). Each character has different special abilities, making each of their playing styles unique. Rei can use the camera's <b>flash</b> <b>to</b> scare <b>off</b> some spirits, but can only use it {{a limited number of}} times. Miku has a special [...] "Sacred Stone" [...] charm that decreases the speed of spirits when used, and a [...] "Double" [...] ability that allows her to charge the camera up twice.
