Early in his captaincy tenure, Border was struggling with the burdens of the position so the ACB appointed Bob Simpson as team coach to assist. This led to animosity between Chappell and Simpson as Chappell derided {{the need for a}} coach. Simpson responded by writing that <b>the</b> <b>peer</b> influence of older players helping younger players fell away during the era when the Chappell brothers led the team, and he was redressing the problem.|$|E

During the journey to the racecourse, Lycett Green asked Edward Somerset his advice, telling <b>the</b> <b>peer</b> that several members of the party were convinced of Gordon-Cumming's guilt. Edward Somerset decided to consult his cousin, Arthur Somerset, and the two men suggested that Lycett Green inform the prince's senior courtier, Lord Coventry.|$|E

5|$|On 15 November 2004, Shaftesbury's Nice-based lawyer, Thierry Bensaude {{reported}} him missing, {{after being}} contacted by his girlfriend, Orche. <b>The</b> <b>peer</b> divided {{his time between}} the Riviera and a home in Hove, East Sussex. He had been due to return home on 10 November. After not hearing from Shaftesbury in a week, they remained concerned when he failed {{to return to his}} rented flat in Adelaide Crescent, Hove. Bensaude and Orche both expressed fears for his safety. Shaftesbury had been taking legal action in relation to the theft of some family antiques and artwork. Some friends and acquaintances mentioned that he had complained of money problems, so they surmised that his disappearance may {{have had something to do}} with the theft and financial loss.|$|E
5|$|Testimony was {{presented}} that in October 2002, Mme M'Barek had convinced <b>the</b> <b>peer</b> {{that she was}} pregnant with his child, and as a result, Shaftesbury married her on 5 November 2002. Shaftesbury made out a new will leaving his new wife properties in Ireland and France. Two years later, with no child forthcoming, he began looking elsewhere for affection. When Shaftesbury initiated divorce proceedings, his wife feared losing her valuable inheritance and began to take steps to secure her financial future.|$|E
5|$|The Marquess of Queensberry, {{the father}} of Wilde's lover Lord Alfred Douglas (who was on holiday in Algiers at the time), had planned to disrupt the play by {{throwing}} a bouquet of rotten vegetables at the playwright when he took his bow {{at the end of}} the show. Wilde and Alexander learned of the plan, and the latter cancelled Queensberry's ticket and arranged for policemen to bar his entrance. Nevertheless, he continued harassing Wilde, who eventually launched a private prosecution against <b>the</b> <b>peer</b> for criminal libel, triggering a series of trials ending in Wilde's imprisonment for gross indecency. Alexander tried, unsuccessfully, to save the production by removing Wilde's name from the billing, but the play had to close after only 86 performances.|$|E

40|$|To {{mitigate}} the attacks by malicious peers and to motivate <b>the</b> <b>peers</b> to share <b>the</b> resources in peer-to-peer networks, several reputation {{systems have been}} proposed in the past. In most of them, <b>the</b> <b>peers</b> evaluate other peers based on their past interactions and then aggregate this information in the whole network. However such an aggregation process requires approximations in order to converge at some global consensus. It {{may not be the}} true reflection of past behavior of <b>the</b> <b>peers.</b> Moreover such type of aggregation gives only the relative ranking of peers without any absolute evaluation of their past. This is more significant when all <b>the</b> <b>peers</b> responding to a query, are malicious. In such a situation, we can only know that who is better among them without knowing their rank in the whole network. In this paper, we are proposing a new algorithm which accounts for the past behavior of <b>the</b> <b>peers</b> and will estimate the absolute value of <b>the</b> trust of <b>peers.</b> Consequently, we can suitably identify them as a good peers or malicious peers. Our algorithm converges at some global consensus much faster by choosing suitable parameters. Because of its absolute nature it will equally load all <b>the</b> <b>peers</b> in network.

The present study examined children's perceptions of two low-achieving peers {{as a function of the}} peers' displayed level of academic effort and whether the participants were able to discuss their beliefs as a group prior to providing responses regarding their perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>peers.</b> Fifth-grade boys and girls listened to short descriptions of two hypothetical low-achieving peers, one who displayed high effort and one who displayed low effort. Participants then provided Likert scale ratings of their attributional beliefs about and affective responses toward <b>the</b> two <b>peers.</b> Additionally, they rated their behavioral intentions toward <b>the</b> two <b>peers,</b> as well as their perception of the peers' cognitive ability. Half of the participants provided responses as individuals, without discussing <b>the</b> <b>peers,</b> while <b>the</b> other half of the participants participated in a short, semi-structured group discussion about <b>the</b> <b>peers</b> before providing their responses. All of the data was collected in gender-consistent groups of three, regardless of the discussion condition. Analyses indicated that the amount of effort a low-achieving child demonstrated, and whether the participants discussed <b>the</b> <b>peers</b> before responding, had a significant effect on the participant's subsequent attributional beliefs, affective responses, behavioral intentions, and perceptions of cognitive ability for <b>the</b> hypothetical <b>peers.</b> Relative to <b>the</b> high-effort <b>peer,</b> <b>the</b> low-effort <b>peer</b> was perceived as exerting lower effort, incited higher levels of anger and lower levels of pity, was less accepted, and was viewed as less intelligent.

25|$|Scholarly {{peer review}} (also known as refereeing) {{is the process}} of {{subjecting}} an author's scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field, before a paper describing this work is published in a journal or as a book. <b>The</b> <b>peer</b> review helps the publisher (that is, the editor-in-chief or the editorial board) decide whether the work should be accepted, considered acceptable with revisions, or rejected. Peer review requires a community of experts in a given (and often narrowly defined) field, who are qualified and able to perform reasonably impartial review. Impartial review, especially of work in less narrowly defined or inter-disciplinary fields, may be difficult to accomplish, and the significance (good or bad) of an idea may never be widely appreciated among its contemporaries. Peer review is generally considered necessary to academic quality and is used in most major scientific journals, but it does by no means prevent publication of all invalid research. Traditionally, peer reviewers have been anonymous, but there is currently a significant amount of open peer review, where the comments are visible to readers, generally with the identities of <b>the</b> <b>peer</b> reviewers disclosed as well.|$|E
