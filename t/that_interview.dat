5|$|For {{most of his}} career, Peart {{had never}} {{publicly}} identified with any political party or organization in Canada or the United States. Even so, his political and philosophical views have often been analyzed through his work with Rush and through other sources. In October 1993, shortly before that year's Canadian federal election, Peart appeared with then-Liberal Party leader Jean Chrétien in an interview broadcast in Canada on MuchMusic. In <b>that</b> <b>interview,</b> Peart stated he was an undecided voter who supported Quebec federalism.|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court {{extended}} the standard from Berghuis v. Thompkins in Salinas v. Texas, 570 U.S. ___ (2013), on June 17, 2013, holding that a suspect's silence {{in response to}} a specific question posed during an interview with police when the suspect was not in custody and the suspect had been voluntarily answering other questions during <b>that</b> <b>interview</b> could be used against him in court where he did not explicitly invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence in response to the specific question. Of the five justices who concluded that the suspect's silence could be used against him in these circumstances, Justices Alito, Roberts and Kennedy concluded that the defendant's Fifth Amendment claim failed because he did not expressly invoke the privilege. The other two Justices, Thomas and Scalia, concluded that the defendant's claim would fail even if he had invoked the privilege, on the theory that the prosecutor's comment at the trial—regarding the defendant's silence {{in response to a}} question during the police interview—did not compel the defendant to give self-incriminating testimony.|$|E

It was revealed that Wally had been held as a prisoner of war in Iraq for the past decade (possibly taken hostage around the time of Lisa's death), and—unaware that he was presumed dead and that Becky had remarried—stated during <b>that</b> <b>interview</b> that what kept him sane during his time in captivity was thinking about his wife and family. Funky visits the Howards to reveal that Wally was alive and in good health. In the August 9, 2009, strip, it was revealed that the grave Becky had visited all these years was that of Wally's assumed remains. Wally has made occasional appearances since his return to Westview, and made his first appearance as a central character in a storyline that began February 1, 2010, strip.|$|E
25|$|Australia resumed at 119/1. With the Ashes {{series on}} the line and 42 degree heat, Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden {{improved}} on their overnight scores, but fell short of centuries, scoring 75 and 92 respectively after lunch. Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey both recorded centuries, with Clarke's being his second in as many Tests. Hussey got out rather cheaply, being caught behind by Geraint Jones. Adam Gilchrist made a quickfire 50 off only 40 balls. After that, he hit 3 sixes and a four from one Monty Panesar over, with the over ultimately costing 24 runs. Subsequent overs cost 10 and 18, with Gilchrist recording the second-fastest century in Test Cricket behind Viv Richards (the mark is the fastest in Ashes history, however), in just 57 balls. In an interview after the day's play, Gilchrist explained that he was unaware of how close he was to the record until after he had scored his century until Ian Healy mentioned it to him during <b>that</b> <b>interview,</b> but was not disappointed to be behind a player {{regarded as one of the}} most damaging hitters to play the game. Soon after, Ponting declared the innings and sent England in to bat. Brett Lee took Andrew Strauss' wicket with an inswinging ball, which Strauss left and it thundered into the pads and was given out, this left England at 0 for 1. By stumps, the score had progressed to 19/1.|$|E

500|$|Connotations was {{the first}} orchestral work in which Copland used serial {{principles}} of composition. Serial or twelve-tone music, Copland stated, carried [...] "a built-in tenseness... a certain drama... a sense of strain or tension" [...] inherent in its extended use of chromaticism. [...] "These are new tensions," [...] he continued, [...] "different from what I would have dreamt up if I had been thinking tonally." [...] To composer John Adams, Copland's embrace of serial technique was not really such as stretch [...] "because ever since the 1920s, he'd already a piss-'n-vinegar penchant for sour intervals, like {{he did in the}} Piano Variations." [...] Contrary to the charge that would be made after Connotations premiere that Copland wrote a twelve-tone work to impress younger composers, he had actually begun using the method at a time when few other American composers were doing so. While Copland's first expressly serial works were his Piano Quartet of 1950 and Piano Fantasy and he noted that some critics (whom he did not name) had traced a similarity in those pieces to his Piano Variations of 1930, he claimed in his 1967 [...] "conversation" [...] with Edward T. Cone that the Variations were [...] "the start of my interest in serial writing... Although it doesn't use all twelve tones, it does use seven of them in what I hope is a consistently logical way." [...] Prior to <b>that</b> <b>interview,</b> few had related Copland's early work to that of the founder of twelve-tone composition, Arnold Schoenberg.|$|E
