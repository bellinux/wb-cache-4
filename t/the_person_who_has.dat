5|$|Mephisto is {{the current}} and two-time {{champion}} after defeating Máscara Dorada at a CMLL show in Arena Mexico May 3, 2016. He is the 32nd overall champion. El Felino has the longest combined reigns at 1,186 days, divided over three separate reigns. Mephisto has the longest individual reign of all champions at 1,141 days from 2004 to 2007. The first champion Fuerza Guerrera is also <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> held the title the shortest time, 22 days, except possibly for Mascara Magica, whose second reign was shorter; no specific date {{for the start of}} the reign has been confirmed, so his reign may have been as short as 6 days.|$|E
5|$|Patients {{and their}} guardians must be apprised of any serious risks {{and the common}} side effects of pain treatments. What {{appears to be an}} {{obviously}} acceptable risk or harm to a professional may be unacceptable to <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> to undertake that risk or experience the side effect. For instance, people who experience pain on movement may be willing to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. The care provider should not insist on treatment that someone rejects, and must not provide treatment that the provider believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits can justify.|$|E

25|$|During a {{greeting}} ritual, <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> entered the contact answers {{a series of}} questions about his or her whole family, from the person who was already there. The answer is sewa, which means that everything is fine. Then the Dogon who has entered the contact repeats the ritual, asking the resident how his or her whole family is. Because the word sewa is so commonly repeated throughout a Dogon village, neighboring peoples have dubbed the Dogon the sewa people.|$|E
25|$|Tort law in India is a {{relatively}} new common law development supplemented by codifying statutes including statutes governing damages. While India generally follows the UK approach, there are certain differences which may indicate judicial activism, hence creating controversy. Tort is breach of some duty independent of contract which has caused damage to the plaintiff giving rise to civil cause of action and for which remedy is available. If there is no remedy it cannot be called a tort because the essence of tort is to give remedy to <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> suffered injury.|$|E
25|$|Georgian is an agglutinative language. There {{are certain}} prefixes and suffixes that are joined {{together}} {{in order to}} build a verb. In some cases, there can be up to eight different morphemes in one verb at the same time. An example can be ageshenebinat ("you (pl) had built"). The verb can be broken down to parts: a-g-e-shen-eb-in-a-t. Each morpheme here contributes to the meaning of the verb tense or <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> performed the verb. The verb conjugation also exhibits polypersonalism; a verb may potentially include morphemes representing both the subject and the object.|$|E

25|$|Conversion, as {{a purely}} civil wrong, is {{distinguishable}} from both theft and unjust enrichment. Theft is obviously an act inconsistent with another's rights, and theft {{will also be}} conversion. But not all conversions are thefts because conversion requires no element of dishonesty. Conversion is also different from unjust enrichment. If one claims an unjust enrichment, <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> another's property may always raise a change of position defense, to say they have unwittingly used up the assets they were transferred. For conversion, there always must be an element of voluntarily dealing with another's property, inconsistently with their rights.|$|E
25|$|Often, teenage couples {{engage in}} sexual conduct {{as part of an}} {{intimate}} relationship. This may occur before either participant has reached the age of consent, or after one has but the other has not. In the latter case, in most jurisdictions, <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> reached the age of consent is guilty of statutory rape. In some jurisdictions (such as California), if two minors have sex with each other, they are both guilty of engaging in unlawful sex with the other person. The act itself is prima facie evidence of guilt when one participant is incapable of legally consenting.|$|E
25|$|Police officers, soldiers, or militiamen {{have been}} implicated {{in most of the}} hundred or so murders of journalists since {{democracy}} was restored in 1986. Employed by corrupt politicians or hired as contract killers, they usually target local radio presenters who have upset the people they are working for. The same modus operandi is nearly always used: two masked men on a motorcycle gun the journalist down as he is leaving his place of work. For a few thousand dollars, they eliminate <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been too outspoken. The cycle of violence has never ended because the culture of impunity is so strong, especially on Mindanao.|$|E

Hernández is also <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> run for governor the most times, a total of five. During his terms as governor, Hernández Colón's administration was known for trying to invigorate the Puerto Rican economy as well as defending the current political status of the island.|$|E
25|$|The Foundation is the {{authorised}} staffing {{establishment of}} the cathedral, few of whom are clergy. The head of the cathedral is the dean, currently Robert Willis, who is assisted by a chapter of 30 canons, four of whom are residentiary, the others being honorary appointments of senior clergy in the diocese. There are also a number of lay canons who altogether form the greater chapter which has the legal responsibility both for the cathedral itself and also for the formal election of an archbishop {{when there is a}} vacancy-in-see. By English law and custom they may only elect <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been nominated by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister. The Foundation also includes the choristers, lay clerks, organists, King's Scholars, the Six Preachers and a range of other officers; some of these posts are moribund, such as that of the cathedral barber. The cathedral has a work force of over 300 (many of whom work part-time), and approximately 800 volunteers.|$|E

SOCAN's The Music Scene placed Laucke among: [...] "five of Canada's best-known soloists". Music critic emeritus, historian, and musician Eric McLean of the Montreal Gazette avowed: [...] "Laucke is <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> done {{more for the}} guitar in this country than anyone else."

500|$|Author Ian Inglis interprets [...] "Far East Man" [...] {{as being}} about Indian sitar maestro Ravi Shankar, for whom Harrison had staged the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971. Three years later, {{with the new}} nation of Bangladesh still beset by problems, and {{conflict}} clouding the issue of friendship generally for Harrison, Inglis suggests that [...] "this is one friendship [...] is determined to preserve". The choruses therefore promise: [...] "I won't let him down ... I won't let him drown ..." [...] Harrison later credited Shankar with being [...] "probably <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> influenced my life the most", since [...] "Indian music was like a stepping-stone to the spiritual path". Inglis views the song as reflecting Harrison's commitment to [...] "all the things that India has given him".|$|E
500|$|His {{blend of}} the {{classical}} and flamenco styles, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "new flamenco" [...] (nuevo flamenco), led music critic Eric McLean of the Montreal Gazette to proclaim: [...] "It is Laucke's interest in flamenco that makes him special: He might be called the first interpreter of flamenco music, {{in the sense that he}} borrows these traditional works by Sabicas, Carlos Montoya and Paco de Lucía, and employs them in his own fashion, a practice to which they agree." [...] Laucke summarized: [...] "The Spanish guitar remains my first love. The flamenco guitar is my passion." [...] According to The Music Scene magazine published by Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN), he is one of [...] "five of Canada's best-known soloists" [...] and the Canadian federal and provincial governments gave him [...] "full recognition as <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> done more for the guitar in this country than anyone else".|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} year, Akhtar {{directed}} Positive, a film produced by Shernaz Italia and Frenzy Kodaiji, starring Boman Irani and Shabana Azmi. It {{was a short}} film running for 12 minutes. Dealing with a family's attitude towards a person suffering from HIV-AIDS, the film was shot in Mumbai and aimed at creating awareness about the problem. It also introduced Arjun Mathur in the film industry. Speaking about {{the purpose of the}} project, Akhtar stated that [...] "Just as a social stigma, many people believe that an HIV patient should be isolated. They also have certain misconceptions about dealing with the disease. And since India has a lot of joint families, it becomes very important for them to understand the value of support to <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> acquired this disease. This is exactly what Positive talks about." [...] The film had its background score composed by Ram Sampath but had no soundtrack. It {{was a part of the}} [...] "AIDS JaaGo" [...] ("AIDS Awake"), a series of four short films, directed by Mira Nair, Santosh Sivan, Vishal Bhardwaj and himself, in a joint initiative of Mira Nair's Mirabai Films, voluntary organisations Avahan and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} {{economic}} effects to <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> to shoulder the double burden. Oftentimes, this {{tends to be}} the woman in the relationship, and so there has been analysis done on the economic effect of the double burden on women. According to Himmelweit (2002), because women often earn less than men, there is the thought that the woman should be the one to fit her paid job around household activities such as taking care of children. Because of this, and because they have many domestic duties, women often take part-time jobs and jobs in the informal sector in order to balance paid work with domestic work. Part-time jobs and jobs in the informal sector do earn less than full-time jobs, so men have to increase their paid work hours in order to compensate for the lacking family income. This will [...] "weaken her earning power and strengthen his", leading to an unequal distribution of power in the household, and allow the man to exploit the woman's unpaid work. This situation could have negative consequences especially for the woman because she is perceived to have less contribution to the household, due to domestic work being seen as less of a contribution than paid work. Such negative consequences include the lack of a divorce threat, where the woman does not have the economic means to ask for a divorce because she does not have a full-time job, and she has less money that she personally receives, decreasing her perceived contributions to the household.|$|E
500|$|One of Gilbert's {{favourite}} comic themes is {{the elevation}} of an unqualified person {{to a position of}} high responsibility. In The Happy Land (1873), for example, Gilbert describes a world in which government offices are awarded to <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> the least qualification to hold each position. In particular, the one who has never heard of a ship is appointed to the cabinet post of First Lord of the Admiralty. In Pinafore, Gilbert revisits this theme in the character of Sir Joseph, who rises to the same position by [...] "never go to sea". In later Gilbert and Sullivan operas, the characters Major-General Stanley in Pirates, and Ko-Ko in The Mikado, are similarly appointed to high office though lacking the necessary qualifications. Gilbert also pokes fun at party politics, implying that when Sir Joseph [...] "always voted at [...] party's call", he sacrificed his personal integrity. The [...] "commercial middle class" [...] (which was Gilbert's main audience) is treated as satirically as are social climbers and the great unwashed. In addition, the apparent age difference between Ralph and the Captain, even though they were babies nursed together, satirises the variable age of Thaddeus in The Bohemian Girl. The Times wrote, in reviewing the 1929 production, that Pinafore was quintessentially Gilbertian in that the absurdities of a [...] "paternal" [...] Captain and the [...] "ethics... of all romanticism" [...] are accepted [...] "unflinchingly" [...] and taken to their logical conclusion: [...] "It is the reference to actuality that is essential; without it, the absurdity will not stand starkly out".|$|E
2500|$|Defending against <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> {{the disc}} {{is a central}} part of the {{defensive}} strategy (colloquially [...] "marking"). The defensive [...] "marker" [...] counts aloud to 10 seconds, which is referred to as [...] "stalling". If the disc has not been thrown when the defending player reaches 10, it is turned over to the other team. [...] "Stall" [...] can be only be called after the defender has actually counted the 10 seconds [...] There can only be one player defending in a 3-meter radius around <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> the disk unless that player is defending against another offensive player. The marker must stay one disc's diameter away from the thrower and must not wrap their hands around the thrower, or the person with the disk can call a foul ("wrapping").|$|E
