5|$|Each {{show is a}} {{synthesis}} of circus styles from around the world, with its own central theme and storyline. Shows employ continuous live music, with performers rather than stagehands changing the props. After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s, Nouvelle Expérience was created – with the direction of Franco Dragone – which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990, but allowed it <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>new</b> shows.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, Neila {{was exposed}} to dancers of {{different}} cultural backgrounds and traditions, inspiring her <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>new</b> Indian dance steps based on classical foundations. In 1977, Neila and her husband founded performing arts company Apsaras Arts {{under the auspices of}} the Kamala Club, an organisation for Indian ladies promoting Indian dance and music. Starting with 20 students, the company expanded in size and significance, and has staged numerous arangetrams (dance débuts) and performances in Singapore and abroad, including Australia, Indonesia and Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Several {{sites were}} {{proposed}} {{as the main}} Expo grounds. One location that was considered was Mount Royal Park, {{to the north of}} the downtown core. But it was Drapeau's idea <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>new</b> islands in the St. Lawrence river, and to enlarge the existing Saint Helen's Island. The choice overcame opposition from Montreal's surrounding municipalities, and also prevented land speculation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} {{approximately}} 500 abandoned ships were used at times as storeships, saloons and hotels; many {{were left to}} rot and some were sunk to establish title to the underwater lot. By 1851 the harbor was extended out into the bay by wharves while buildings were erected on piles among the ships. By 1870 Yerba Buena Cove had been filled <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>new</b> land. Buried ships are occasionally exposed when foundations are dug for new buildings.|$|E
5|$|The SSSI is {{economically}} {{important to}} the area because of the tourists it attracts for birdwatching and other outdoor activities, although sensitive wildlife sites are managed to avoid damage from {{the large numbers of}} visitors. Another threat is the encroachment of the sea on this soft coast. The Environment Agency considers that managed retreat {{is likely to be the}} long-term solution, and is working with the Norfolk Wildlife Trust <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>new</b> reserves inland to compensate for the loss of scarce habitats at the coast.|$|E

A proposal to enlarge the CLR's tunnels <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>new</b> platforms at Holborn station and to abandon British Museum station was included in a private bill submitted to parliament by the CLR in November 1913, although the First World War prevented any works taking place.|$|E

5|$|A {{successful}} {{invasion of}} Egypt would have several further advantages for the Byzantine Empire. Egypt {{was a rich}} province, and {{in the days of}} the Roman Empire it had supplied much of the grain for Constantinople before it was lost to the Arabs in the 7th century. The revenues that the Empire could have expected to gain from the conquest of Egypt would have been considerable, even if these would have to be shared with the Crusaders. Furthermore, Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric's plans, not only to deflect the ambitions of the Latins away from Antioch, but also <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>new</b> opportunities for joint military ventures that would keep the King of Jerusalem in his debt, and would also allow the Empire to share in territorial gains.|$|E
5|$|Bowman {{argued that}} the {{authorized}} sale of the seeds extinguished the patent, and that Bowman merely used seeds legitimately purchased from the silo. He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created {{an exception to the}} exhaustion doctrine, and that this decision was properly for Congress to decide. Monsanto {{argued that the}} second-generation seeds were not subject to exhaustion because they had not existed until Bowman created them and had not been sold at the time of infringement. He noted that even when exhaustion applied, it did not allow one <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>new</b> copies of the patented product, which the second-generation seeds were.|$|E

5|$|Epic narratives, poems, sagas and allegories {{from all}} {{cultures}} tell such gripping tales {{that they have}} inspired countless other stories in all forms of entertainment. Examples include the Hindu Ramayana and Mahabharata; Homer's Odyssey and Iliad; the first Arabic novel Hayy ibn Yaqdhan; the Persian epic Shahnameh; the Sagas of Icelanders and the celebrated Tale of the Genji. Collections of stories, such as Grimms' Fairy Tales or those by Hans Christian Andersen, have been similarly influential. Originally published in the early 19th century, this collection of folk stories significantly influence modern popular culture, which subsequently used its themes, images, symbols, and structural elements <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>new</b> entertainment forms.|$|E
5|$|Human {{beings have}} played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>new</b> ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{there are}} five extant schools of Noh acting called Kanze (観世), Hōshō (宝生), Komparu (金春), Kongō (金剛), and Kita (喜多) schools that train shite actors. Each school has its own iemoto family that carries {{the name of the}} school and is {{considered}} the most important. The iemoto holds the power <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>new</b> plays or modify lyrics and performance modes. Waki actors are trained in the schools Takayasu (高安), Fukuou (福王), and Hōshō (宝生). There are two schools that train kyōgen, Ōkura (大蔵) and Izumi (和泉). 11 schools train instrumentalists, each school specializing in one to three instruments.|$|E

This faction within the early partition movement bears some resemblance to the movements that have arisen {{from time to time}} in parts of some Canadian provinces to break away and form new provinces. For example, also in the 1970s, there was a movement, led by the Parti Acadien, <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a <b>new</b> Acadian province out of northern New Brunswick.|$|R

5|$|In March 2010 the Secretary of State for Transport, Andrew Adonis {{announced}} that Euston was the preferred southern terminus {{of the proposed}} High Speed 2 line, which would connect to a newly-built station near Curzon Street and Fazeley Street in Birmingham. This would require expansion {{to the south and}} west <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>new</b> sufficiently long platforms. These plans involved a complete reconstruction, involving the demolition of 220 Camden Council flats, with half the station providing conventional train services and the new half high-speed trains. The Command Paper suggested rebuilding the Arch, and included an artist's impression of it.|$|E
5|$|International Speedway Corporation (ISC) is a {{corporation}} whose primary business is the {{ownership and management}} of NASCAR and IndyCar race tracks. ISC was founded by NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr. in 1953 {{for the construction of}} Daytona International Speedway and in 1999 they merged with Penske Motorsports {{to become one of the}} largest motorsports companies in North America. The company has played an important, though controversial, role in the modernization of the sport. It has worked with NASCAR <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>new</b> tracks and update older ones in an effort to improve the racing and the experience for spectators (though because both companies have several members of the France family in top positions, ISC's competitors have filed multiple lawsuits on antitrust grounds) and has constructed popular new tracks in regions previously thought uninterested in NASCAR.|$|E
