5|$|Although flat designs {{have the}} benefit of simplicity, other designs such as {{inverted}} pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective.

5|$|Despite Swedish {{hopes that}} the Dutch would not enter the conflict, they honored their 1649 treaty by sending a 45-ship relief fleet. On October 7, 1658 the Dutch fleet set sail from Vlie.

Wrangel suggested the Swedes should attack, but Charles X still wanted to avoid provoking the Dutch.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal orb webs {{are fairly}} common, despite being less {{effective}} at intercepting and retaining prey and {{more vulnerable to}} damage by rain and falling debris. Various researchers have suggested that horizontal webs offer compensating advantages, such as reduced vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> damage; reduced visibility to prey flying upwards, because of the back-lighting from the sky; enabling oscillations to catch insects in slow horizontal flight. However, {{there is no single}} explanation for the common use of horizontal orb webs.|$|E

5|$|Since {{wind speed}} is not constant, a wind farm's annual energy {{production}} is never {{as much as}} the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors are 15–50%; values at {{the upper end of the}} range are achieved in favourable sites and are due <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> turbine design improvements.|$|E

5|$|Soaring related <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> shear, {{also called}} dynamic soaring, is a {{technique}} used by soaring birds like albatrosses, who can maintain flight without wing flapping. If the wind shear is of sufficient magnitude, a bird can climb into the wind gradient, trading ground speed for height, while maintaining airspeed. By then turning downwind, and diving through the wind gradient, they can also gain energy. It has also been used by glider pilots on rare occasions.|$|E
5|$|The Algodones Dunes, which border old Cahuilla shorelines, {{were formed}} by sand blown from Lake Cahuilla. This theory was first {{formulated}} in 1923. The process occurred either {{immediately after the}} lake reached modern highstands, or during earlier higher stands. Most likely, sand was transported to the dune field during times where the lake receded and its bed was exposed <b>to</b> <b>wind.</b> Various stages of Lake Cahuilla may correspond to waves of migrating dunes.|$|E

50|$|A {{ship that}} is beating will sail as close <b>to</b> the <b>wind</b> as possible; this {{position}} is known as close hauled. In general, the closest angle <b>to</b> the <b>wind</b> that a ship can sail is around 35 to 45 degrees. Some modern yachts can sail very near <b>to</b> the <b>wind,</b> while older ships, especially square-rigged ships, were much worse at it.|$|R
5000|$|A steam brig is a two-masted {{sailing ship}} with {{auxiliary}} steam power. The advantage {{was supposed to}} be that the ship could sail up-wind when it was convenient, and additionally, it could use the steam power to move relative <b>to</b> the <b>wind</b> <b>to</b> obtain a more advantageous angle <b>to</b> the <b>wind.</b>|$|R
