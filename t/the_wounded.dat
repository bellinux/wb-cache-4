In 1907, she sailed for Morocco with the French expeditionary force under General Antoine Marius Benoît Drude. As head of a team of SSBM volunteers, she established an infirmary in Casablanca, treating <b>the</b> <b>wounded</b> in the conflicts between the French and Moroccans. As conditions were difficult in Morocco, it was decided <b>the</b> <b>wounded</b> and seriously ill should be transported to Oran in Algeria where {{it would be easier to}} provide proper treatment. It was in October 1907 while she and two of her nurses were accompanying <b>the</b> <b>wounded</b> on a French naval crossing to Oran, that she first met General Hubert Lyautey, who was division commander there. After spending fifteen months in North Africa, she returned to France, only to leave shortly afterwards for the Italian port Messina in December where she and her nursing team helped care for the 80,000 victims of the 1908 earthquake. As a result of their exemplary services, they were decorated by Princess Hélène of Orléans.|$|E

40|$|Pressure {{transduction}} to <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> bed {{in negative}} pressure wound therapy (NPWT) {{is crucial in}} stimulating the biological effects ultimately resulting in wound healing. In clinical practice, either foam or gauze is used as wound filler. Furthermore, two different drainage techniques are frequently employed. One involves the connection of a non-perforated drainage tube {{to the top of}} the dressing, while the other involves the insertion of perforated drains into the dressing. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of these two different wound fillers and drainage systems on pressure transduction to <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> bed in a challenging <b>wound</b> (<b>the</b> sternotomy <b>wound).</b> Six pigs underwent median sternotomy. <b>The</b> <b>wound</b> was sealed for NPWT using different wound fillers (foam or gauze) and drainage techniques (see earlier). Pressures between 0 and - 175 mmHg were applied and the pressure in <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> was measured using saline-filled catheters sutured to the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> (over <b>the</b> anterior surface of the heart) and to the side of <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> (on <b>the</b> thoracic wall). The negative pressure on <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> bed increased linearly with the negative pressure delivered by the vacuum source. In a dry <b>wound,</b> <b>the</b> pressure transduction was similar when using <b>the</b> different <b>wound</b> fillers (foam and gauze) and drainage techniques. In a wet wound, pressure transduction was better when using a perforated drainage tube inserted into <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> filler than a non-perforated drainage tube connected {{to the top of the}} dressing (- 116 +/- 1 versus - 73 +/- 4 mmHg in <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> at a delivered pressure of - 125 mmHg for foam, P < 0. 01), regardless of <b>the</b> type of <b>wound</b> filler. Gauze and foam are equally effective at delivering negative pressure to <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> bed. Perforated drainage tubes inserted into <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> filler are more efficient than a non-perforated drainage tubes connected to the top of the dressing. The choice of drainage technique may be particularly important in wounds with a large volume of exudate...|$|R
