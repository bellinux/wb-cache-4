5|$|As Ko and Aoba enter <b>their</b> <b>summer</b> break, a {{girl named}} Akane Takigawa with a {{striking}} resemblance to Wakaba moves in next door to Ko.

5|$|Bob {{receives}} a package containing his childhood toys, which consist of {{nothing more than}} a scouring pad, a rusted spatula, and a dog-shaped soap bar.

Worried that he is doing the same to his own children, he fires Tina, Gene and Louise and encourages them to enjoy <b>their</b> <b>summer</b> vacation.

Thus the villages were deserted for at least eight months of the year.|$|E

5|$|As it is {{separated}} from the mainland by 3miles (4.8km) of water, few large mammals inhabit the island, except those that traverse the ice during the winter months. Rabbits, fox, raccoons, otters, mink, gray and red squirrels, and chipmunks are all common as is the occasional beaver and coyote. Bats are the most abundant migratory mammals as crossing the water is no obstacle for them. There are many limestone caves serving as homes for the bats and many insects on the island for the bat to prey on. The island is frequented by migratory birds on their trips between <b>their</b> <b>summer</b> and winter habitats. Eagles and hawks are abundant in April and May, while smaller birds such as yellow warblers, American redstart, and indigo bunting are more common in early summer. Near the shoreline, gulls, herons, geese, and loons are common. Owls, including snowy owls and great grey owls, come to the island from the Arctic to hunt in the warmer climate. Other birds, such as chickadees, cardinals, blue jays, and woodpeckers, live on the island year-round. Toads have also been found.|$|E
5|$|Common loons {{are mainly}} Nearctic, and breed from 48° N to the Arctic Circle, locally south to 40° N and north to 78° N. During their {{breeding}} season {{in spring and}} summer, most common loons live on lakes and other waterways in the northern United States and Canada, {{as well as in}} southern parts of Greenland, in Iceland, in Svalbard, in Jan Mayen, and in Bear Island in Norway; and in Alaska, to the west, and very rarely in Scotland, to the east. <b>Their</b> <b>summer</b> habitat ranges from wooded lakes to tundra ponds. The lakes must be large enough for flight take-off, and provide a large population of small fish. Deep lakes with warm surface waters, relatively low biological productivity and low turbidity where their fish prey are easy to see are habitats where breeding loons are more successful in raising young. For protection from predators, common loons favour lakes with islands and coves. They are rare visitors to the Arctic coast. They are known to exhibit high breeding site fidelity.|$|E

5|$|During {{the evening}} of 19 November, a {{thunderstorm}} followed by a drenching downpour broke over the opposing armies. In a few hours every wadi in the foothills and on the plain was in flood. The black soil plain, hard and firm during summer, became in these winter conditions sticky and heavy for marching and almost impassable for wheeled vehicles. The temperature, which had been hot {{during the day and}} pleasant at night, dropped rapidly to become piercingly cold. The infantrymen had been marching light in <b>their</b> <b>summer</b> uniform of twill shorts and tunics. With only one blanket (and/or a Greatcoat), this gear gave little protection from the driving rain and bitter chill.|$|E
5|$|Hess, {{the oldest}} of three children, was born on 26 April 1894 in Alexandria, Egypt, into the ethnic German family of Fritz Hess, a prosperous {{merchant}} from Bavaria, and Clara Hess (née Münch). His brother, Alfred, was born in 1897 and his sister, Margarete, was born in 1908. The family lived in a villa on the Egyptian coast near Alexandria, and visited Germany often from 1900, staying at <b>their</b> <b>summer</b> home in Reicholdsgrün (now part of Kirchenlamitz) in the Fichtel Mountains. Hess attended a German language Protestant school in Alexandria from 1900 to 1908, when he {{was sent back to}} Germany to study at a boarding school in Bad Godesberg. He demonstrated aptitudes for science and mathematics, but his father wished him to join the family business, Hess & Co., so he sent him in 1911 to study at the École supérieure de commerce in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. After a year there, Hess took an apprenticeship at a trading company in Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|In his autobiography, Butlin {{recorded}} {{that his}} mother remarried and emigrated to Canada around 1910 and passenger lists of the period show Bertha travelling to Toronto via Montreal in 1912.

Butlin's mother and stepfather then asked him to join them in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was unhappy at school in Canada, mocked because of his English accent, and he left school at fourteen. Eventually {{he got a job}} as a messenger boy at Eatons, Toronto's largest department store. One of the best aspects of working for the company was {{that he was able to}} visit <b>their</b> <b>summer</b> camp, which gave him his first taste of a real holiday, indeed a taste of what was to become a very big part of his life. Later he transferred to Eatons advertising department where he drew black and white adverts, while studying at night school twice a week.|$|E
