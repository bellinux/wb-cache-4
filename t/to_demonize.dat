5|$|In America, {{neoconservative}} {{aspirations to}} use the United States' military power to further destroy evildoers are thrown off track by the election of George H. W. Bush to the presidency, followed by the election in 1992 of Bill Clinton which left them totally out of power. The neoconservatives, along with their conservative Christian allies, attempt <b>to</b> <b>demonize</b> Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, the American people do not turn against Clinton. Meanwhile, Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the relative safety of Afghanistan and declare a new strategy. To fight Western-inspired moral decay, they must deal a blow to its source: the United States.|$|E
25|$|According to {{historian}} James Mark, {{memories and}} {{opinions of the}} Red Army in Hungary are mixed. Nationalists, conservatives and anti-Communists tend <b>to</b> <b>demonize</b> the Soviets because of the atrocities that they committed during World War II, while Jews, left-wingers and liberals generally downplay stories of Soviet crimes.|$|E
25|$|The antireligious {{propaganda}} {{was critical}} in order <b>to</b> <b>demonize</b> active believers and foster a mindset of hostility against them as 'vermin' or 'scum', {{and it was}} in some ways similar to the contemporary anti-Semitic propaganda of Nazi Germany.

25|$|First {{with the}} arrival of Islam in Africa, then during the Christian colonial efforts, the religiously {{justified}} wars, the colonial portrayal of idolatry as proof of savagery, the destruction of idols and the seizure of idolaters as slaves marked a long period of religious intolerance, which supported religious violence and demeaning caricature of the African Traditional Religionists. The violence against idolaters and idolatry of Traditional Religion practicers of Africa started in the medieval era and continued into the modern era. The charge of idolatry by proselytizers, state Michael Wayne Cole and Rebecca Zorach, served <b>to</b> <b>demonize</b> and dehumanize local African populations, and justify their enslavement and abuse locally or far off plantations, settlements or for forced domestic labor.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} after the war, Sherman's conservative politics was attractive to white Southerners. By the 1880s, however, Southern [...] "Lost Cause" [...] writers began <b>to</b> <b>demonize</b> Sherman for his attacks on civilians in the [...] "March". [...] The Confederate Veteran magazine, based in Nashville, gave Sherman more attention than anyone else, in part to enhance the visibility of the western theater. His devastation of railroads and plantations mattered less than the March's insult to southern dignity, especially its unprotected womanhood. [...] Moody criticizes English historians Field Marshal Viscount Garnet Wolseley, Maj. Gen. John F. C. Fuller, and especially Capt. Basil H. Liddell Hart, who built up Sherman's reputation by exaggerating his [...] "atrocities" [...] and filtering his actions through their ideas about modern warfare.|$|E
500|$|The first organized, {{large-scale}} propaganda campaigns were during World War I. Germany {{created the}} German Information Bureau to create pamphlets, books and other communications that {{were intended to}} support the justness of their cause, to encourage voluntary recruitment, <b>to</b> <b>demonize</b> the enemy and persuade America to remain neutral in the conflict. In response to learning about Germany's propaganda, the British created a war propaganda agency called the Wellington House in September 1914. Atrocity stories, both real and alleged, were used to incite hatred for the enemy, especially after the [...] "Rape of Belgium" [...] in 1915. France created a propaganda agency in 1914. Publicity in Australia led to a lift in the government's ban on military drafts. [...] Austria-Hungary used propaganda tactics to attack the credibility of Italy's leadership and its motives for war. Italy in-turn created the Padua Commission in 1918, which led Allied propaganda against Austria-Hungary.|$|E
50|$|In the DVD {{edition of}} the 1998 film Jinnah, the director's {{commentary}} of the film makes mention of the 1982 film. In the commentary, both Sir Christopher Lee, who portrayed the older Muhammed Ali Jinnah, and director Jamil Dehlavi criticized the film Gandhi for it's portrayal of Jinnah, arguing it <b>to</b> be <b>demonizing</b> and historically inaccurate.|$|R
50|$|Life After Manson is a 2014 {{documentary}} film directed by Olivia Klaus that offers an intimate portrait {{of one of}} the world’s most infamous crimes and notorious killers. At the age of 21 years, Patricia Krenwinkel murdered at the command of Charles Manson. Krenwinkel continues <b>to</b> be <b>demonized</b> by the public and haunted by the suffering she caused in 1969.|$|R
50|$|Fascism, as a regime, {{was seen}} by De Felice {{as nothing more than}} Mussolini's policy, which tended to make of Fascist {{ideology}} just the superstructure of Mussolini's dictatorship and personal power. De Felice felt that fascism should be seen as valid political ideology, not just something <b>to</b> be <b>demonized</b> and dismissed in simplistic terms. He argued that studies on Fascism should get out from the political debate and become a historiographical issue based on scientific assertions.|$|R
500|$|Victorian adventurer and sexologist Sir Richard Francis Burton (John Robinson), {{following}} an [...] "unfortunate encounter" [...] with the Fountain of Youth in 1892, is 170 {{years old and}} living in Toronto, Canada. Burton, now living and working as the chief taxidermist at a Museum of Natural History, is searching for a centerpiece display for an exhibit in his Hall of Contagion. He comes {{up with the idea}} of featuring AIDS and the Patient Zero hypothesis. Accepting the popular belief that Zero introduced the virus to North America, Burton sets out to collect video footage from those who knew Zero to support the hypothesis. When Zero's doctor (Brenda Kamino), mother (Charlotte Boisjoli) and former airline colleague Mary (Dianne Heatherington), who is now with ACT UP, all refuse <b>to</b> <b>demonize</b> Zero, Burton manipulates the footage to make it appear as if they do and includes doctored photographs of Zero showing signs of Kaposi's sarcoma. He presents this preliminary version to the press.|$|E
500|$|Steve Perry has {{expressed}} ambivalence towards the lasting vilification of the Daddies' name, admitting it's [...] "probably the most heinous {{name in the}} history of rock" [...] while emphasizing a disparate delineation between the band's roots in the [...] "bubble" [...] of Eugene's punk subculture and their unexpected longevity in the wider cultural mainstream: [...] "I started this band a long time ago, and we just used [...] We didn't know that in 10 years we'd turn into some sort of happy, peppy, feel-good things". Though Perry has occasionally voiced regret over not having changed the Daddies' name earlier in their career, he has nevertheless acquiescently embraced the name as his [...] "Holden Caulfield red hunting hat", while outright dismissing critics who choose <b>to</b> <b>demonize</b> the name based on literal interpretation than the jazz-era jive slang it drew from. [...] "It gives outrage addicts another soapbox they can jump up on", Perry said, [...] "If people want to just look at it , then that's their problem, but I don't write it that way"..."I assure you we don't cruise high schools for dates".|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Frank and {{incoming}} House Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{were accused}} by Rep. John Hostettler (R-IN) {{of having a}} [...] "radical homosexual agenda"; Frank responded [...] "I do have things I {{would like to see}} adopted on behalf of LGBT people: they include the right to marry the individual of our choice; the right to serve in the military to defend our country; and the right to a job based solely on our own qualifications. I acknowledge that this is an agenda, but I do not think that any self-respecting radical in history would have considered advocating people's rights to get married, join the army, and earn a living as a terribly inspiring revolutionary platform." [...] Frank's stance on outing gay Republicans has been called the [...] "Frank Rule" [...] whereby a closeted person who uses her or his power, position, or notoriety to hurt LGBT people can be outed. The issue became relevant during the Mark Foley scandal of 2006, during which Frank clarified his position on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher: [...] "I think there's a right to privacy. But the right to privacy should not be a right to hypocrisy. And people who want <b>to</b> <b>demonize</b> other people shouldn't then be able to go home and close the door and do it themselves." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{book was}} made into a {{television}} movie, By Dawn's Early Light. There are some significant differences between the two; most significantly, in the movie the initial nuclear exchange is prompted by renegade Russian terrorists rather than part of a Soviet plot. That is likely intended <b>to</b> avoid <b>demonizing</b> either side as being the aggressor. Another element of the movie is a romantic subplot between the captain of the B-52 and his female co-pilot, which is absent from the book.|$|R
50|$|The {{attack on}} the Orthodox became more {{generally}} an attack against all religions around 1927. Sects that had originally been praised in the official press for their loyalty and hard-work, despite their religious convictions that were problematic to implementing Communism, began <b>to</b> be <b>demonized</b> in the late 1920s. Even when these other religions tried to reaffirm their compatibility with Marxism and their loyalty to the state, but this was rejected in the official propaganda that increasingly depicted all religious activity as harmful and in contradiction with Communism.|$|R
2500|$|The Southern Poverty Law Center {{included}} NOM on its Winter 2010 list of [...] "anti-gay groups" [...] that [...] "have continued <b>to</b> {{pump out}} <b>demonizing</b> propaganda aimed at homosexuals."

500|$|The {{decision}} of the United States Congress to pass the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was based on poorly attended hearings and reports based on questionable studies. In 1936 the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) noticed an increase of reports of people smoking marijuana, which further increased in 1937. The Bureau drafted a legislative plan for Congress seeking a new law, {{and the head of}} the FBN, Harry J. Anslinger, ran a campaign against marijuana. Newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst's empire of newspapers used the [...] "yellow journalism" [...] pioneered by Hearst <b>to</b> <b>demonize</b> the cannabis plant and spread a public perception that there were connections between cannabis and violent crime. Several scholars argue that the goal was to destroy the hemp industry, largely as an effort of Hearst, Andrew Mellon and the Du Pont family. They argue that with the invention of the decorticator hemp became a very cheap substitute for the wood pulp that was used in the newspaper industry. However, Hearst newspapers owed large debts to Canadian suppliers of paper, who used wood as raw material. If an alternative raw material for paper had emerged, it would have lowered the price of the paper needed to print Hearst's many newspapers—a positive thing for Hearst. Moreover, by the year 1916 there were at least five [...] "machine brakes" [...] for hemp and it is unlikely that in 1930s hemp became a new threat for newspapers owners.|$|E
500|$|Orci said getting Nimoy in {{the film}} was important. [...] "Having him sitting around a camp fire sharing his {{memories}} was never gonna cut it" [...] though, and time travel {{was going to be}} included {{in the film}} from the beginning. Kurtzman added, saying the time travel creates jeopardy, unlike other prequels where viewers [...] "know how they all died". The writers acknowledged time travel had been overused in the other series, but it served a good purpose in creating a new set of adventures for the original characters before they could completely do away with it in other films. Abrams selected the Romulans as the villains because they had been featured less than the Klingons in the series, and thought it was [...] "fun" [...] to have them meet Kirk before they do in the series. Orci and Kurtzman noted it would feel backward <b>to</b> <b>demonize</b> the Klingons again after they had become heroes in later Star Trek series, and the Romulan presence continues Spock's story from his last chronological appearance in [...] "", an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation set in 2368. The episode of the original continuity in which Kirk becomes the first human to ever see a Romulan, [...] "Balance of Terror", served as one of the influences for the film. Orci said it was difficult giving a good explanation for the time travel without being gimmicky, like having Nero specifically seeking to assassinate Kirk.|$|E

It does nothing to counter these insecurities and inequalities and represents an abandonment of universalistic and solidaristic principles. Instead, it subjects a growing minority to coercive measures and immiseration, while allowing them <b>to</b> be <b>demonized</b> and blamed for being victims of a situation not of their making. Labour should move away from its espousal of workfare {{and come up with}} egalitarian and emancipatory alternatives, such as basic income, that respond to labour market realities...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of jazz in Sweden fed into discourses renegotiating modern forms of identity in welfare society. In this new Jazz Age, music became an arena for reformulating norms of age, class, ethnicity, and gender differences. This article presents an intersectional and inter-medial study of songs, films and print sources with such topics. The new jazz idiom {{was linked to}} enticing and horrifying forms of otherness. Four basic positions are highlighted in the successive integration of both jazz and identities, from separation <b>to</b> fusion: <b>demonizing</b> exclusion, primitivist polarization, diversifying hybridization and normalizing assimilation...|$|R

Second, a substantial source of this system’s cost-effectiveness was an unanticipated consequence of earlier railroad deregulation. Third, it is ironic that cap-and-trade has come <b>to</b> be <b>demonized</b> by conservative politicians in recent years, since this market-based, cost-effective policy innovation was initially championed and implemented by Republican administrations. Fourth, court decisions and subsequent regulatory responses have led to the collapse of the SO 2 market, demonstrating that what the government gives, the government can take away. since the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 launched a grand experiment in market-based environmental policy: the SO 2 cap-and-trade system.

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{focuses on}} several masculinities conceptualized by Holden Caulfield within the sociohistorical {{context of the}} 1950 s.

I propose that Holden’s “craziness” {{is the result of}} there being no positive images of heteronormative masculinity and no alternative to the rigid and strictly enforced roles offered to boys as they enter manhood.
