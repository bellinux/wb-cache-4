5|$|The {{coconut crab}} has a {{well-developed}} sense of smell, which it uses to locate its food. The process of smelling works very differently {{depending on whether}} the smelled molecules are hydrophilic molecules in water or hydrophobic molecules in air. As most crabs live in the water, they have specialised organs called s on their antennae to determine both the concentration and the direction of a smell. However, as coconut crabs live on the land, the aesthetascs on their antennae are shorter and blunter than those of other crabs and look more like those of insects. While insects and the coconut crab originate from different paths, the same need to detect smells in the air {{led to the development of}} remarkably similar organs. Coconut crabs flick their antennae as insects do to enhance their reception. They have an excellent sense of smell and can detect interesting odours over large distances. <b>The</b> <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> rotting meat, bananas, and coconuts, all potential food sources, catch their attention especially. Research has shown that the olfactory system in the coconut crab's brain is well-developed compared to other areas of the brain.|$|E
25|$|The Guinness Storehouse is {{a popular}} tourist {{attraction}} at St. James's Gate Brewery in Dublin, where a self-guided tour includes {{an account of the}} ingredients used to make the stout and a description of how it is made. Visitors can sample <b>the</b> <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> each Guinness ingredient in the Tasting Rooms, which are coloured with a unique lighting design that emits Guinness' gold and black branding. A pint of Guinness is offered which the visitor may pour after a demonstration by one of the staff. There are videos showing how Guinness is tested by a panel of tasters, and the visitor is instructed in tasting the beer. The tour includes such items as the historical coopering trade within Guinness, a section dedicated to advertising and merchandising by Guinness, and a section dedicated to historical artefacts and footage relating to Guinness. The tour finishes with a pint of Guinness (if it has not already been drunk at one of the other bars) in the Gravity Bar. Two other bars, a coffee shop and a restaurant, are available to visitors during the tour, and a range of Guinness merchandise is available to purchase.|$|E

2500|$|Aside {{from the}} slowing and/or {{reversing}} of calcification, organisms may suffer other adverse effects, either indirectly through negative impacts on food resources, or directly as reproductive or physiological effects. For example, the elevated oceanic levels of [...] may produce -induced acidification of body fluids, known as hypercapnia. Also, increasing ocean acidity {{is believed to}} have a range of direct consequences. For example, increasing acidity has been observed to: reduce metabolic rates in jumbo squid; depress the immune responses of blue mussels; and make it harder for juvenile clownfish to tell apart <b>the</b> <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> non-predators and predators, or hear the sounds of their predators. This is possibly because ocean acidification may alter the acoustic properties of seawater, allowing sound to propagate further, and increasing ocean noise. This impacts all animals that use sound for echolocation or communication. Atlantic longfin squid eggs took longer to hatch in acidified water, and the squid's statolith was smaller and malformed in animals placed in sea water with a lower pH. The lower PH was simulated with 20-30 times the normal amount of [...] However, as with calcification, as yet there is not a full understanding of these processes in marine organisms or ecosystems.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1830 and 1850, more heavy {{industry}} began to locate in Paris. [...] One tenth {{of all the}} steam engines in France {{were made in the}} capital. [...] The industrial enterprises were usually located in the outer parts of the city, where there was land and access to the rivers or canals needed to move heavy goods. [...] The metallurgy industry established itself along the Seine {{in the eastern part of}} the city. [...] The chemical industry was located near La Villette, in the outer part of the city, or at Grenelle. [...] Factories were established to make matches, candles, rubber, ink, gelatine, glue, and various acids. A thousand workers were employed by the Gouin factory in Batignolles to make steam engines. Fifteen hundred were employed by the Cail factories in Grenelle and Chaillot to make rails and ironwork for bridges. [...] At Levallois-Perret, a young engineer, Gustave Eiffel, started an enterprise to make the frames of iron buildings. [...] The eastern part of the city was subjected to noise, smoke, and <b>the</b> <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> industry. [...] Wealthier Parisians moved to the west end of the city, which was quieter and where the prevailing winds blew the smoke in the other direction. When the wealthy and middle-class people deserted these areas, most of the shops also closed and relocated elsewhere, leaving the outer suburbs of eastern Paris with only factories and housing occupied by the poor.|$|E
