25|$|It {{was at this}} {{juncture}} that Kember and Pierce chose {{to enter into a}} contractual relationship with Gerald Palmer, a Northamptonshire businessman and concert promoter who had already been functioning recently as Spacemen 3's de facto manager. This tripartite business partnership had the following terms: Palmer would own the master tapes of all future recordings, the rights of which would be licensed to record labels for release; touring and recording costs etc. would be financed by Palmer, who would give Kember and Pierce an advance of £1,000 each; and, in return, all profits would be split 50:50: 50% for Palmer, and 50% for Kember and Pierce and other band members. Significantly, this contract was only with Kember and Pierce, meaning Spacemen 3 as a legal and financial entity would, in essence, constitute only the <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>together</b> with Palmer. In addition, Palmer became Spacemen 3's manager.|$|E

Joel Kelly of TV Squad criticized the decision to pair Quinn with Finn again in the Valentine's Day oriented episode. He saw it as a regression of the characters, and commented: [...] "Yes, it feels like Glee Classic, because the series started with the <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>together.</b> But both of them have changed—Quinn more so than Finn—and having them dating again seems like they're going back to the days when Quinn was the icy lead Cheerio and Finn was the nice but dumb star quarterback." ...|$|E

He also admitted to a post-ceremony fight on Twitter with longtime Oscars writer Bruce Vilanch.

Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{reported that}} [...] "Winter Madness" [...] fell {{into the category of}} an episode that featured [...] "a lot of funny gags but aren't wholly satisfying" [...] and added that it [...] "just stopped, rather than building to a real conclusion". Sean Gandert of Paste rated unfavorably the pairing of Alec Baldwin and Julianne Moore's characters, citing {{that they do not have}} [...] "much rapport, so the scenes with the <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>together</b> are a bit dead, as much as I usually enjoy seeing Julianne Moore in pretty much anything." [...] Amos Barshad for New York magazine criticized Moore's Boston accent, citing that it was [...] "atrocious", while TV Guide Magazines Bruce Fretts opined that the accent was [...] "wicked bad". Regarding the episode itself, Fretts said that it was [...] "weak".|$|E

As the season progresses, Lauren and Puck's relationship continues to grow stronger. Their relationship begins to form in the ninth episode of the second season titled [...] "Special Education". After Puck attempts to recruit new members for the William McKinley High School glee club, members of the football team lock him in a port-a-potty. After being discovered by Lauren, he convinces her to join New Directions, despite her belief that show choir is stupid. Ashley Fink said of their relationship: [...] "I think Ryan Murphy has a master plan and we're all kind of along for the ride. I know what you mean, but I wouldn't count us out just yet on that front. We all have to laugh at ourselves but it's going somewhere. Ultimately, {{it comes down to}} whether audiences will buy a relationship between Puck and Lauren. I think there's a really hilarious chemistry between Puck and Lauren. I think he's a badass, she's a badass. I don't know, I think they're funny together. There's something about the <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>together</b> that I like, so I hope it's not outside the realm of possibility." ...|$|E

500|$|Nominal {{impedance}} {{first started}} to be specified {{in the early days}} of telecommunications. [...] At first amplifiers were not available and when they did become available they were expensive. [...] It was consequently necessary to achieve maximum power transfer from the cable at the receiving end in order to maximise the lengths of cables that could be installed. [...] It also became apparent that reflections on the transmission line would severely limit the bandwidth that could be used or the distance that it was practicable to transmit. [...] Matching equipment impedance to the characteristic impedance of the cable reduces reflections (and they are eliminated altogether if the match is perfect) and power transfer is maximised. [...] To this end, all cables and equipment {{started to be}} specified to a standard nominal impedance. [...] The earliest, and still the most widespread, standard is 600 Ω, originally used for telephony. [...] It has to be said that the choice of this figure had more to do with the way telephones were interfaced into the local exchange than any characteristic of the local telephone cable. [...] Telephones (old style analogue telephones) connect to the exchange through twisted pair cabling. [...] Each leg of the pair is connected to a relay coil which detect the signalling on the line (dialling, handset off-hook etc.). [...] The other end of one coil is connected to a supply voltage and the second coil is connected to ground. [...] A telephone exchange relay coil is around 300 Ω so the <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>together</b> are terminating the line in 600 Ω.|$|E
500|$|The video premiered on June 28, 2008 on ABC.

Todd Martens of The Los Angeles Times was {{disappointed}} with the video's special effects and production values, adding that it looked [...] "as if it were filmed with one camera on a tripod in a single-bulb basement". However, he complimented how they [...] "show off Miley's universal appeal". Henry Freeland of Paste magazine said, [...] "Cyrus wiggles to and fro, mugging for the camera like her face is fighting gravity and barely winning." [...] A Pop Cultured review from MTV described the video as PG and [...] "Disney approved". The review continued that it was mildly angry, comparing Cyrus to [...] "a watered-down version of Avril Lavigne's kid sister, and Lindsay Lohan's pseudo-rebellious character in Freaky Friday [...] minus the eyeliner". Leigh Holmwood of The Guardian commented, [...] "Miley's new music vid, reminds me, creepily enough, of early Britney." [...] Molly Lambert of the New York Times described Cyrus as the video's [...] "charismatic center" [...] and writes, [...] "When she flashes Nick’s dog tags {{and a picture of}} the <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>together,</b> she seems so vindictive and so embarrassingly vulnerable, just like [...] [...] [...] a 15-year-old suffering her first serious heartbreak, basically." [...] The video received a nomination for MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to Tokio Hotel's music video for [...] "Ready, Set, Go!".

That same year, Joystick Division's James Hawkins ranked Chris as the seventh sexiest video game character, commenting: [...] "Though Chris gets matched up with some of the finest damsels in all of video gaming, he never comes across as sleazy.
