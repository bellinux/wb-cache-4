Parks {{later said}} about being asked to move {{to the rear of the}} bus, [...] "I thought of Emmett Till and I just couldn't go back." [...] Blake said, [...] "Why don't you stand up?" [...] Parks responded, [...] "I don't think I should have to stand up." [...] Blake called the police to arrest Parks. When recalling the {{incident}} for Eyes on the Prize, a 1987 public television series on the Civil Rights Movement, Parks said, [...] "When he saw me still sitting, he asked if I was going to stand up, and I said, 'No, I'm not.' And he said, 'Well, if you don't stand up, I'm going to have to call the police and have you arrested.' I said, 'You may do that.'" ...|$|E

60|$|Midwinter looked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> {{and gently}} shook his head.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, he {{admitted}} that when he lost money in a casino, he lost his temper and began throwing chairs <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> breaking them.|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate, {{come into}} the shade," [...] said Marmaduke, glancing uneasily <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of <b>the</b> house. [...] "This open place is enough to give us sunstroke." ...|$|R
60|$|This defense {{seemed to}} {{surprise}} them, for they fell {{back a little}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> At that moment, with a low rumble, the press started, moving slowly at first but gradually acquiring speed. The sight aroused the resentment of the invaders.|$|R
60|$|She drew {{away from}} him, gently, and turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
60|$|Dick {{stiffened}} in his seat. Thorne, {{with sudden}} clenching of hands, wheeled <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{storekeeper}} {{smiled and}} strolled casually <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Coming back he leaned upon the counter.|$|E

60|$|The {{others were}} {{entering}} the room now and Tarzan turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> little <b>window.</b>|$|R
60|$|The road ran up {{the huge}} {{treeless}} swell of prairie <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> lighted <b>windows</b> of a grocery store.|$|R
60|$|She {{broke off}} with a little gesture of relief, and moving <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> flung the {{shutters}} back.|$|E
60|$|He walked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{and stood}} {{looking out for}} a moment or two before he turned to her again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Natives?" [...] Watts considered. [...] "Yes, there's {{some kind}} of aborigines living out there." [...] He waved vaguely <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
60|$|Kenwyne laughed, {{and nodded}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> open <b>window,</b> {{through which they}} {{heard the sound of}} cheerful {{whistling}} approaching them along the trail.|$|R
60|$|The {{sound and}} tumult as of running feet and of many voices crying came louder from the street. The {{people at the}} tables had turned in their seats to listen. The music of the {{orchestra}} had stopped. The waiters had thrown back the heavy curtains from <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> and <b>the</b> people were crowding to them to look out into the street. Knickerbocker had risen in his place, his eyes looked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> but his gaze was fixed on vacancy as with one who sees a vision passing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{take them}} to the {{daylight}} and examine them," [...] he said, and walked {{from the center of the}} store, which was lighted by gas, <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> show <b>window.</b>|$|R
60|$|Johnsy lay, {{scarcely}} {{making a}} ripple under the bedclothes, {{with her face}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Sue stopped whistling, thinking she was asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "As you will, John Carter," [...] said Hor Vastus, [...] "but--What was that?" [...] he whispered, {{pointing}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{overlooking the}} gardens.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{the stories}} I could tell to the boys!' she cried, and then Peter gripped her {{and began to}} draw her <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Sad, sad and drooping, {{looked the}} little white maiden, as {{she stood on the}} hearth-rug, with the hot blast of the stove {{striking}} through her like a pestilence. Once, she threw a glance wistfully <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> and caught a glimpse, through its red curtains, of the snow-covered roofs, and the stars glimmering frostily, and all the delicious intensity of the cold night. The bleak wind rattled the window-panes, as if it were summoning her to come forth. But there stood the snow-child, drooping, before the hot stove! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{girls were}} peeling fruit. The younger one went on. The elder stopped, {{and looked at}} her mother. Mrs. Vanborough beckoned to Blanche to come to her, and pointed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> French <b>window</b> opening to <b>the</b> floor.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> Englishman turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> wide, open <b>window,</b> {{and gazed}} steadfastly {{at the place}} in the crowd where she had vanished.|$|R
60|$|I {{was looking}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> As she spoke her last words, I was {{conscious}} {{of a change in}} that part of the room.|$|E
60|$|Would she {{notice the}} locket {{as she sat}} down? Emily turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> so as to let the light fall on the diamonds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] she answered, {{turning her}} head away <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and looking out {{mechanically}} at the falling rain. [...] "Only my own thoughts." ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{perceived}} {{direction of}} motion of plaids windowed by elongated spatial Gaussians is biased <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>window's</b> long axis. <b>The</b> bias increases as the relative angle between the plaid motion and the long axis of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> increases, peaks {{at a relative angle}} of â‰ˆ 45 deg, and then decreases. The bias increases as <b>the</b> <b>window</b> is made narrower (at fixed height) and decreases as the component spatial frequency increases (at fixed aperture size). We examine several models of human motion processing (cross-correlation, motion-energy, intersection-of-constraints, and vector-sum), and show that none of these standard models can predict our data. We conclude that spatial integration of motion signals plays a crucial role in plaid motion perception and that current models must be explicitly expanded to include such spatial interactions.

6000|$|The dining-room was a {{very long}} apartment, and was reached through a passage; so that John, upon his entrance, brought but little light with him, and must move <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> with spread arms, groping and {{knocking}} on the furniture. Suddenly he tripped and fell his length over a prostrate body. It was what he had looked for, yet it shocked him; and he marvelled that so rough an impact should not have kicked a groan out of the drunkard. Men had killed themselves ere now in such excesses, a dreary and degraded end that made John shudder. What if Alan were dead? There would be a Christmas-day! ...|$|R
60|$|A {{minute or}} two later Agatha saw Winifred in the wagon when it reappeared from behind the straw-pile, and Mrs. Hastings turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{the stories}} I could tell to the boys!" [...] she cried, and then Peter gripped her {{and began to}} draw her <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. Barnes {{dropped the}} port, and Mrs. Barnes, emulating her daughter's example, screamed. The inspector, as though {{conscious}} of the draught, moved rapidly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No, thank you, sir I can't {{stand that}} sort of thing. I'll race you round the piazza with pleasure, Cousin, but his oven {{is too much for}} me," [...] was Mac's uncivil reply as he backed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> open <b>window,</b> as if glad of an excuse to escape.|$|R
6000|$|... (He flings his arm <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> open <b>windows.)</b> --like <b>the</b> {{flowers and}} {{the trees in the}} doctor's garden groping to the light of the sun. Maybe the one'll die for lack of the proper soil, and many is cruelly trampled on, but the rest'll be growing, and none to stop 'em.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately the {{apartment}} is quite roomy. There are three windows in front. At one side is the stove, with a cheerful fire of oak wood, near by a good supply of fresh sticks, whose faint aroma is plain. On another side is the bed with white coverlid and woollen blankets. <b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> is a huge arm-chair, (a Christmas present from Thomas Donaldson's young daughter and son, Philadelphia) timber'd as by some stout ship's spars, yellow polish'd, ample, with rattan-woven seat and back, and over the latter a great wide wolf-skin of hairy black and silver, spread to guard against cold and draught. A time-worn look and scent of old oak attach both to the chair and the person occupying it.|$|R
