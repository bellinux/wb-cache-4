25|$|On {{the eve of}} the 18th birthday, a half-fairy half-mortal {{girl named}} Lyra had a strange dream. All her friends and family were <b>there</b> <b>tonight</b> to {{celebrate}} that special event, and Lyra's grandfather Tangle had prepared an amazing gift for her. But then Lyra heard a whisper, and everyone quickly disappeared. Waking up from that dream, Lyra finds herself alone in her beloved Town of Wish as she is being trapped in a parallel dimension which is very similar to her original one. Guided by the messages left by Tangle plus using her father's magically hidden airship, Lyra breaks out to find Tangle's odd fairy friend simply called the Clockmaker, who is the only stranger could help her get back home, and reunite with family and friends. She finds the Clockmaker in his hideout and thankfully, he agrees to help. Lyra have to find three magical keys in three separately hidden areas; Treehouse Village, Wind Music Island, and Water Collector; to re-activate the Clockmaker's Time Synchronization Machine.|$|E
500|$|When Police Chief Charles Gain {{heard about}} the {{unauthorized}} Elephant Walk raid, he immediately went to the location and ordered his men to leave. [...] Later that night, freelance reporter Michael Weiss saw a group of police officers celebrating at a downtown bar. [...] "We were at City Hall the day [...] happened and we were smiling then," [...] one officer explained. [...] "We were <b>there</b> <b>tonight</b> and we're still smiling." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, Julie Siddiqi of the Islamic Society of Britain {{expressed concern that}} the killing would be used to create ethnic and community divisions. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe condemned the attack and called for a calm and [...] "measured response", adding [...] "we have met with community representatives, and extra officers remain on duty <b>there</b> <b>tonight.</b> Across London our officers are in contact with their communities too." [...] Commander Simon Letchford later noted community concerns following the incident and assured that an investigation was under way. He also appealed for calm and avoidance of speculation. An additional 1,200 police officers were deployed across London to prevent revenge attacks on Muslim communities.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} {{possible}} that, even there, <b>there</b> is none <b>tonight.</b> <b>There</b> is no order among these fellows, as there is among the Company's troops and, {{as there is no}} enemy near, they think that such a watch is unnecessary; and if any have been sent there, they are pretty sure to have gone to the huts, to talk over the news from Delhi. The matter should be easy enough.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said, [...] "Middleton, you {{can turn}} in and take a sleep. At twelve o'clock <b>tonight</b> <b>there</b> will be a boat below for us." ...|$|R
60|$|Thomasin sat in {{an inner}} room and heard Venn's voice. When {{customers}} were present she seldom showed herself, owing to her inherent dislike for the business; but perceiving {{that no one}} else was <b>there</b> <b>tonight</b> she came out.|$|E
60|$|At {{night she}} walked to prayer meeting in the schoolhouse a mile away. She always went, and Spencer was {{generally}} on hand to see her home. He was not <b>there</b> <b>tonight.</b> She wished she had not come. It was dreadful to have to sit still and think. She did not hear a word the minister said.|$|E
60|$|Oh, I {{know how}} you feel! I've been in hell myself. You are <b>there</b> <b>tonight.</b> By {{difference}} in time you are at luncheon, now--and not eating it. Nothing is so lonesome as gadding around platforming. I have declined 45 lectures to-day-England and Scotland. I wanted the money, but not the torture: Good luck to you!--and repentance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be very angry, dear," [...] said Mrs. Hauksbee. [...] "My idiot of an ayah {{has gone}} home, and, as I hope to sleep <b>tonight,</b> <b>there</b> isn't a soul {{in the place}} to unlace me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Catherine Corless {{appeared}} on The Late Late Show on 10 March 2017, receiving {{a standing ovation}} {{at the end of}} the segment. Host Ryan Tubridy said [...] "If that audience represents the people watching <b>tonight,</b> <b>there</b> is a hunger in this country for the truth." ...|$|R
60|$|Kennedy {{inspected}} his friend's face anxiously by {{the light}} of the lamp over the school gate. There was no mistake about it. Fenn certainly did look bad. His face always looked lean and craggy, but <b>tonight</b> <b>there</b> was a difference. He looked used up.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. It's {{back here}} from the road a piece. Camp <b>there</b> <b>tonight.</b> Reason I stopped---- Struck me you've never done any {{mountain}} driving, and there's some pretty good climbs in the Park; slick road, but we go up to almost nine thousand feet. And cold mornings. Thought I'd tip you off to some driving tricks--if you'd like me to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{started this}} {{afternoon}} for Cardun. He {{and all the}} able bodied men were ordered to assemble <b>there</b> <b>tonight</b> in readiness to begin {{the war against the}} wolves at daybreak. There is no other house within a mile, and even had they heard me there they could have given me no assistance, seeing there are but women and children remaining behind." ...|$|E
6000|$|As Jimmy ambled away to {{look for}} some beetles, he chuckled and chuckled and chuckled. [...] "I guess that by this time Peter wishes he hadn't thought of that joke on Reddy Fox and myself," [...] said he. [...] "Perhaps I'll go back <b>there</b> <b>tonight</b> and perhaps I won't. He won't know whether I do or not, and he won't dare come out." ...|$|E
6000|$|Siegmund {{dropped his}} head. The dead spring of his emotion swelled up {{scalding}} hot again. Then he said, almost inaudibly: 'Ah, don't {{speak to me}} like that, dear. It is late to be angry. When I have seen your train out <b>tonight</b> <b>there</b> is nothing left.' ...|$|R

5000|$|After gymnast Gabby Douglass gold medal-winning {{performance}} at 2012 Summer Olympics individual all-around, NBC aired a commercial of Crystal swinging on gymnastic rings. Wallace {{of the magazine}} New York called it a [...] "cringe-worthy juxtaposition" [...] that sparked much debate about racism on Twitter. Sportscaster Bob Costas had just said, [...] "There are some African American girls out <b>there</b> who <b>tonight</b> are saying to themselves: Hey, Id like to try that too." [...] Crystals ad had been broadcast three times previously and was a promotion for NBCs upcoming sitcom, Animal Practice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Deed, and I've lots {{of things}} to be thankful for," [...] said Patty cheerily. [...] "Don't you fret about me. I'm vain enough to think I've got some brains anyway, and I'm a-meaning to do {{something}} with them too. Now I think I'll go upstairs and study this evening. It will be warm enough <b>there</b> <b>tonight,</b> and the noise of the machine rather bothers me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Captain Jim had no fish. He seldom {{went out}} in his boat that summer, and his long {{tramping}} expeditions were over. He {{spent a great deal}} of his time sitting by his seaward window, looking out over the gulf, with his swiftly-whitening head leaning on his hand. He sat <b>there</b> <b>tonight</b> for many silent minutes, keeping some tryst with the past which Anne would not disturb. Presently he pointed to the iris of the West: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] he said, [...] "there's my old client, Van Trompe, {{has come}} over from Kentucky, and set all his slaves free; {{and he has}} bought a place seven miles up the creek, here, back in the woods, where nobody goes, unless they go on purpose; and it's a place that isn't found in a hurry. There she'd be safe enough; but the plague of the thing is, nobody could drive a {{carriage}} <b>there</b> <b>tonight,</b> but me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Half {{of those}} who remain to them of the red police were lost in that foolish attempt to {{recapture}} you. They lost their heads when they lost you. They flung all they had at the theatre. We cut them off from the Council House <b>there.</b> Truly <b>tonight</b> has been a night of victory. Everywhere your star has blazed. A day ago--the White Council ruled as it has ruled for a gross of years, for {{a century and a}} half of years, and then, with only a little whispering, a covert arming here and there, suddenly--So!" ...|$|R
6000|$|When we had {{finished}} the work in hand, he said to me, [...] "And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you and I, and rest to recuperate. Tomorrow we shall have much to do, but for the <b>tonight</b> <b>there</b> is no need of us. Alas!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Gallop narrated {{the first}} Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoon in 1945. He also narrated two later [...] "Casper" [...] cartoons, <b>There's</b> Good Boos <b>Tonight</b> in 1948, and A-Haunting We Will Go in 1949. He was the narrator for an ABC {{animated}} children's program, Cartoonies, {{for six months}} in 1963. [...] Gallop was also the narrator for a 1961 documentary, The Legend of Rudolph Valentino and a 1962 Buster Keaton documentary, The Great Chase.|$|R
6000|$|... "If we can't {{talk her}} into it when she's sober, by heaven we'll get her drunk.... Now Blink, it's settled. Let's {{stay away from}} <b>there</b> <b>tonight.</b> Forget it. We'll {{go out and do}} the hard riding stunt of our lives. We'll sell horses. With some money we can figure on homes far from this bitter country--homes, cowboy, do you savvy that? With cattle and horses--some fine open grassy rolling country--where nobody ever heard of Blinky Moran and Panhandle Smith." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] said Van Helsing, [...] "Winchesters {{it shall}} be. Quincey's head is level at times, but most so {{when there is}} to hunt, metaphor be more dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the {{meantime}} we can do nothing here. And as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of us, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as <b>there.</b> <b>Tonight</b> and tomorrow we can get ready, and then if all be well, we four can set out on our journey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very {{important}} news, sir. I {{have been}} in Saumur, and have learned that an officer has started for Thouars, by way of Loudun, with orders to General Salomon to march instantly into Saumur, {{and that he is}} to arrive <b>there</b> <b>tonight.</b> I left the town five minutes after the messenger. Three-quarters of an hour later I struck the road, two miles this side of Saumur; and have been brought here in a cart, by a peasant. It is now four o'clock, and I do not think that the officer would arrive at Thouars before half past three." ...|$|E
5000|$|Najo's spring {{training}} statistics {{indicate that he}} played well {{enough to make the}} major league team. However, {{on the final day of}} {{spring training}}, Najo was released to the San Antonio Bears. The Chicago Daily Tribune reported, [...] "The Sox squad was cut down by one today when Najo ... was shipped to the San Antonio club to which he has been released outright. <b>There</b> are others <b>tonight</b> awaiting the signal to move." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{dressed with}} more than usual care that night. Your wise general never throws away a move. He was {{particular}} about his tie. As a rule, Wilson selected one for him. But there had been times when Wilson had made mistakes. One could not rely absolutely on Wilson's taste in ties. He did not blame him. Better men than Wilson had gone wrong over an evening tie. But <b>tonight</b> <b>there</b> must be no taking of chances.|$|R
50|$|But <b>tonight</b> <b>there</b> {{is someone}} I can write {{of the way}} I used to write, without {{reservations}} of any kind. Last Thursday at the Harvard Square theatre, I saw my rock and roll past flash before my eyes. And I saw something else: I saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on a night when I needed to feel young, he {{made me feel like}} I was hearing music for the first time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Frankly, mother, then, I {{do think}} it is {{probable}} that an attempt may be made to stop us, and that not by regular robbers, but by your enemies. They did their best to prevent me from reaching Tours, and will now most likely try to prevent our arriving at Blois. I will {{tell you all about it}} when we get <b>there</b> <b>tonight.</b> Here is the order for my father's release. Will you hide it in your dress? I had rather not have it about me. And, mother, if we should be attacked, do not be alarmed, for I have reason to believe that if we should be outnumbered and hard pressed, help will speedily be forthcoming." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you have}} some hot blood," [...] he said. [...] "I know you love him. So do I, or I {{should not have been}} <b>there</b> <b>tonight.</b> Do I blame his bitterness? Do I blame--anything he does? The {{treatment}} he has had would bring a blush of shame to the cheek of any nation save a republic. Republics are wasteful, sir. In George Rogers Clark they have thrown away a general who might some day have decided the fate of this country, they have left to stagnate a man fit to lead a nation to war. And now he is ready to intrigue against the government with any adventurer who may have convincing ways and a smooth tongue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Roses? So Fritz {{has been}} here! I have brought you lilies, Avis. Oh, Avis, I miss you so! You were so jolly and good--you {{understood}} a fellow so well. I {{had to come}} here tonight {{to tell you how}} much I miss you. It doesn't seem half home without you. Avis, I'm trying to be a better chap--more the sort of man you'd have me be. I've given the old set the go-by--I'm trying to live up to your standard. It would be easier if you were here to help me. When I was a kid it was always easier to be good for awhile after I'd talked things over with you. I've got the best mother a fellow ever had, but you and I were such chums, weren't we, Avis? I thought I'd just break down in <b>there</b> <b>tonight</b> and put a damper on everything by crying like a baby. If anybody had spoken about you, I should have. Hello!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Donna Bowman from The A.V. Club gave a B rate to {{the episode}} saying: [...] "These {{last couple of}} episodes have been a mixed bag. We're seeing, I suspect, an {{excellent}} sitcom experiencing the growing pains of a long American season. <b>Tonight</b> <b>there</b> were at least two moments that rank among the best the show has produced. Yet the overall storyline doesn't feel like it has the energy or inventiveness we saw {{at the start of}} the season." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{episode is}} {{considered}} the weakest of the series. In {{a review of the}} episode, Entertainment Weekly's Tanner Stransky notes, [...] "You'd think an episode titled Icing on the Cake would be sweet and totally Betty-licious. Coated in wonderful Betty one-liners. Whipped up with delicate Betty care. And smoothed over with a perfect Betty glaze. Just the way fans ordered it. But that's not how our dessert was served up <b>tonight.</b> <b>There</b> was something actually ugly — okay, maybe just unattractive — about this episode of Betty, don't you think, TV Watchers?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Sullivan was a {{broadcasting}} pioneer at {{many levels}} during televisions infancy. As TV critic David Bianculli wrote, [...] "Before MTV, Sullivan presented rock acts. Before Bravo, he presented jazz and classical music and theater. Before the Comedy Channel, even before <b>there</b> was the <b>Tonight</b> Show, Sullivan discovered, anointed and popularized young comedians. Before there were 500 channels, {{before there was}} cable, Ed Sullivan was where the choice was. From the start, he was indeed the Toast of the Town." [...] In 1996, Sullivan was ranked number 50 on TV Guides [...] "50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time".|$|R
