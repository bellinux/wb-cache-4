5|$|British Vice-Admiral Sir George Brydges Rodney {{had been}} warned that de Grasse was {{planning}} {{to take at least}} part of his fleet north. Although he had some clues that he might take his whole fleet (he was aware of the number of pilots de Grasse had requested, for example), he assumed that de Grasse would not leave the French convoy at Cap-Français, and <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fleet would escort it to France. So Rodney accordingly divided his fleet, sending Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood north with 15 ships of the line and orders to find de Grasse's destination in North America and report to New York. Rodney, who was ill, took the rest of the fleet back to Britain in order to recover, refit his fleet, and to avoid the Atlantic hurricane season. Hood sailed from Antigua on 10 August, five days after de Grasse. During the voyage, one of his ships became separated and was captured by a privateer.|$|E

Cherry stated <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> inspiration for the character came from his childhood neighbors. He explained, [...] "When I was growing up in Huntington, Calif., two Italian families from the Bronx moved in across the street. We were so WASPy, so middle American. They had their own ethnic identity. It was an interesting juxtaposition." [...] Cherry insisted that Angie was not replacing the deceased Edie Britt character (Nicollette Sheridan) as a main housewife but would instead be the focus of the season's mystery.|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} {{three years}} serving in Port Tobacco, de Barth {{was assigned to}} a church in Pennsylvania in 1795. The main church in the area, Conewago Chapel, {{was the center of}} the only parish in [...] of the Pennsylvania frontier, an area that contained few Catholics. The sparsely populated area had been mostly settled by Germans, who were pleased to have a priest who was able to speak their native language. In 1798, Carroll visited de Barth at Conewago to tour <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> diocese and to administer the sacrament of confirmation. Michael Francis Egan, an Irish Franciscan, joined him there in 1802. In 1804, de Barth was formally put in charge of Conewago Chapel, which had previously fallen under the jurisdiction of the Jesuits. At the same time, he continued making visitations to the small rural chapels in the area. In 1806, de Barth laid the cornerstone of a new church, St. Patrick's, in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Four years later, he helped found another St. Patrick's church, this time in York.|$|E

500|$|While {{recording}} Scar's song [...] "Be Prepared," [...] Irons encountered challenges {{with his}} voice. The actor reportedly [...] "blew out his voice" [...] upon belting the line [...] "you won't get a sniff without me," [...] rendering him incapable of completing the musical number. Consequently, Disney {{was forced to}} recruit American voice actor Jim Cummings, who had also been providing the voice of The Lion Kings laughing hyena Ed at the time, to impersonate Jeremy Irons and record the entire of the song. Jim Cummings told The Huffington Post that [...] "tunt singing" [...] is actually something the actor continues to do regularly, having done the same for American actor Russel Means, voice of Chief Powhatan in Disney's Pocahontas (1995). Critics observed that Irons [...] "fakes his way... through 'Be Prepared' in the grand tradition of talk-singing," [...] drawing similarities between him and American actor James Cagney and English actor Rex Harrison. Deja revealed that, during a recording session, Irons' stomach was grumbling. Deja joked, [...] "The growling sound could be heard in his recording, {{so we had to}} record <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dialog all over again." [...] As a result of Irons' prominent British accent, critics have compared both the actor and Scar to Shere Khan, the villain of Disney's The Jungle Book (1967), voiced by English actor George Sanders.|$|E

Rodney made his dispositions accordingly, balancing the likely requirements of the fleet in North America with the need to protect Britain's own trade convoys. Sixteen of his twenty-one battleships, therefore, were to sail with Hood in pursuit of de Grasse to the Chesapeake before proceeding to New York. [...] Rodney, who was ill, meanwhile took three other battleships back to England, two as merchant escorts, leaving his remaining two in dock for repairs. [...] Hood was well satisfied with these arrangements, telling a colleague that his fleet was [...] "equal fully to defeat any designs of the enemy, let de Grasse bring or send what number of ships he might in aid of Barras." [...] What neither Rodney or Hood knew was de Grasse's last minute decision to take his entire fleet to North America, thus ensuring a French superiority of three to two in battleship strength. Blissfully unaware of this development, Hood eventually sailed from Antigua on August 10, five days after de Grasse. [...] During the voyage, one of his smaller ships carrying intelligence about the American pilots was captured by a privateer, thus further depriving the British in New York of valuable information. [...] Hood himself, following the direct route, reached the Chesapeake on August 25, and found the entrance to the bay empty. [...] He then sailed on to New York to meet with Admiral Sir Thomas Graves, in command of the New York station following Arbuthnot's departure.|$|E
