500|$|Upon {{the news}} of Francis' casting, Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote that the soap opera had [...] "finally {{mastered}} the art of stunt casting". She also stated that seeing Francis paired with Tristan Rogers [...] "will be delicious", and that she thought [...] "we can all agree this is a far more exciting addition to the show than Eric Roberts or Sean Young". She gave [...] "kudos" [...] to the soap opera for creating [...] "what is sure to be must-see daytime TV". When news broke of Francis' dismissal, Bibel wrote: [...] "Francis's character, Genevieve, was, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>mildly,</b> not an audience favorite. She started out as a dark psychopath hellbent on revenge then, when that persona made the character less than viable over the longterm, morphed overnight into an aspiring business woman. Neither incarnation played to Francis’s strengths as an actress." [...] Omar White-Nobles of TVSource wrote: [...] "Genevieve was determined to bring down her crime lord husband Colin (Tristan Rogers) and attempt to reconcile with her son. Unfortunately for Francis, playing a vengeful ice queen turned shrewd businesswoman didn’t work for the audience. Subsequent attempts to soften the character failed as well, leaving aborted pairings with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) and Victor Newman (Eric Braeden)." ...|$|E

Colbert, [...] "Borglum, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>mildly,</b> was a temperamental {{artist who}} managed to offend most {{everyone}} with whom he worked". They note that [...] "Borglum's past insolence had not left him in the good graces of the art community" [...] and his designs met a hostile reception at the commission. Sculptor member James Earle Fraser, designer of the Buffalo nickel, rejected Borglum's initial design on July 22, eight days after they were received. [...] The inscription on the reverse included a tribute to Harding; Fraser deemed it inartistic. [...] Borglum submitted a second set on August 14, this was again rejected; the commission criticized the design, {{which seemed to be}} only a segment of a larger one, rather than specifically designed to fit a half dollar. [...] Borglum wanted to ignore what he deemed [...] "damn fool suggestions", but the Association threatened to fire him if he did not complete the coin. Borglum was concerned the reverse was still too crowded, and proposed leaving off the eagle, but space was saved when Coolidge did not like the reference to Harding, and it was omitted. [...] With the eagle still in place on the reverse, Fraser finally approved the designs on October 10, 1924. [...] In all, Borglum made nine plaster models for the design.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{internal}} inconsistencies, misleading conclusions {{and lack of}} completeness in the analyses of the small x deep inelastic data in recent papers of HERA physicists, particularly in a very recent one by the H 1 collaboration are pointed out. It is also shown that, when an analysis without prejudice is carried over, the situation {{is very different from}} the one claimed there in what respects checks of theoretical expectations. The so-called H 1 Collaboration has recently produced a preprint concerning deep inelastic data at small x, that we will henceforth call HERA 2. The work constitutes an improvement of the former HERA analysis [1] of the structure function F 2, to be denoted by HERA 1, extending it to wider x, Q 2 ranges and greatly diminishing the errors. There is not much to be argued about the experimental obtaining of the data. The machine and the detectors worked wonderfully. The quality of the data is excellent. It is therefore more of a pity that the physicists in the collaboration have not been more careful with the subsequent theoretical analysis which shows features that, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> as <b>mildly</b> as possible, are difficult to justify.

At its very start, ghosts of Follies showgirls stalk the stage, mythic giants in winged, feathered, black and white opulence. Similarly, ghosts of Twenties shows slip through the evening as the characters try desperately to regain their youth through re-creations of their performances and inane theater sentiments of their past." ...|$|E

[...] According to Stuart Jeffries of The Guardian, [...] "This was, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>mildly,</b> uncomfortable viewing: 45-plus minutes of torture porn mingled with something even more unpalatable ... this wasn't so much entertainment as psychic evisceration for us."

Brian Lowry from CNN also criticized the episode: [...] "Nevertheless, its most admirable qualities have increasingly been overshadowed by its more distasteful ones -- not merely in demonstrating just how brutal humanity can be, but by toying with its audience."
