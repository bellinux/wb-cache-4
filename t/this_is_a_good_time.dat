60|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> {{to drop in}} a {{paragraph}} of information. There is no regular livery stable in Honolulu, or, indeed, {{in any part of}} the Kingdom of Hawaii; therefore unless you are acquainted with wealthy residents (who all have good horses), you must hire animals of the wretchedest description from the Kanakas. (i.e. natives.) Any horse you hire, even though it be from a white man, is not often of much account, because it will be brought in for you from some ranch, and has necessarily been leading a hard life. If the Kanakas who have been caring for him (inveterate riders they are) have not ridden him half to death every day themselves, you can depend upon it they have been doing the same thing by proxy, by clandestinely hiring him out. At least, so I am informed. The result is, that no horse has a chance to eat, drink, rest, recuperate, or look well or feel well, and so strangers go about the Islands mounted as I was to-day.|$|E

50|$|Composting {{is a way}} {{to recycle}} kitchen and garden waste while {{creating}} inexpensive organic fertilizer for the garden and landscape. Earthworms, microbes and other soil flora and fauna feast on such organic matter when provided adequate nitrogen and proper temperatures and moisture. The ideal size for a compost pile or bin is one cubic yard (3' x 3' x 3'). It should be placed in a partly shady location to avoid intense sun and drying out, as this will delay the decomposition process. The pile heats up during the decomposition process, then cools as material is transformed, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to turn the pile, so that undecomposed materials {{on the periphery of the}} pile can be moved to the center to complete the process. With adequate moisture, nitrogen, proper temperature and correct timing of turning the pile, compost can be made in about a 30-day period. Left alone this process will still occur, but may take three to four months under less-than-ideal conditions.|$|E

5000|$|In early 2013, a {{bill was}} in process to combine Bridgemont Community and Technical College in Montgomery with Kanawha Valley Community and Technical College in South Charleston.

[...] Then-Bridgemont President Beverly Jo Harris said [...] "We have worked hand in hand KVCTC {{over the past several years}} trying not to duplicate programs, ... Now under one administrative structure, we’ll have a very broad range of healthcare and technology programming." [...] Over the 2013-14 academic year, the schools operated independently. In the fall of 2014, the combined schools became officially known as BridgeValley Community and Technical College (BVCTC). Harris was named president of the new multi-campus college.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the initial duel, the party of six (Wells, Maddox, McWorter, Crain, Dr. Cuny, and Dr. Denny) prepared to celebrate survival. They walked toward the remaining Maddox partisans, because no participant of the duel had a violent relationship with that group. The duel participants were balanced in number (three each) and unarmed {{with the exception of the}} seconds. Crain carried a loaded pistol in each hand. The duel participants were intercepted by the remaining Wells partisans; Crain now faced three additional armed men. Seeing this from a distance, the remaining Maddox partisans began running forward to join the group. General Cuny, who had previously fought with Crain, is recorded as having called out to him, [...] "Col. Crain, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to settle our difficulty." [...] Crain fired, missing Cuny but striking Bowie in the hip and knocking him to the ground. Cuny and Crain then exchanged fire, with Crain sustaining a flesh wound in the arm and Cuny dying from a shot to the chest or thigh.|$|E

5000|$|White {{church member}} Eugene England, a {{professor}} at Brigham Young University, wrote in 1998: <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to remind ourselves that most Mormons are still in denial about the ban, unwilling to talk in Church settings about it, and that some Mormons still believe that Blacks were cursed by descent from Cain through Ham. Even more believe that Blacks, {{as well as other}} non-white people, come color-coded into the world, their lineage and even their class a direct indication of failures in a previous life ... I check occasionally in classes at BYU and find that still, twenty years after the revelation, a majority of bright, well-educated Mormon students say they believe that Blacks are descendants of Cain and Ham and thereby cursed and that skin color is an indication of righteousness in the premortal life. They tell me these ideas came from their parents or Seminary and Sunday School teachers, and they have never questioned them. They seem largely untroubled by the implicit contradiction to basic gospel teachings.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was later}} {{announced}} that actress Rachel Shenton had been {{cast in the}} role. Shenton described the character as being the complete opposite of her. Shenton had previously auditioned for a role in Hollyoaks but was not successful. Speaking of her audition for Mitzeee, Shenton stated during an interview with entertainment website Digital Spy: [...] "This role came up and I thought, 'Yep, brilliant - <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to do this.' For Hollyoaks, it's a time of change. Paul has a great reputation {{and it felt like}} a really good time to do this." [...] Shenton also credits herself in the creation of Mitzeee's backstory. Shenton conducted research into the type of character Mitzeee is, and how the backstory would make her act how she does in the present. Before the character had appeared on-screen Shenton received media attention for her image, with tabloids reporting on her likeness to Cheryl Cole and branded it as an attempt to 'sex up' the serial. Shenton described the attention and comparisons as [...] "very flattering". In August 2011, of her future in the role Shenton said [...] "I won't be going anywhere for a while. Mitzeee's such a great character to play." ...|$|E
