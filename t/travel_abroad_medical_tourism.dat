40|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>tourism</b> is an up {{and coming}} {{phenomenon}} in the globalization of the healthcare market with implication on the healthcare industry. The CDC reports that up to 750, 000 Americans travel outside of the United States to receive medical care and studies show that this number has trended upwards {{over the last several}} years. Medical tourists outsource their healthcare services to decrease the financial burden of healthcare, to reduce wait times and to access quality healthcare services unavailable through their insurance company. However, while the advantages of <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> are identified, research also highlights the uncertainties and misconceptions associated with the phenomenon. As more individuals opt out of receiving healthcare in their own developed countries and choose to <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> to receive healthcare services in developing countries, the risks and benefits of <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> are emerging and necessitates consideration of the role <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> will play in the future of the healthcare market. In addition, as medical tourists return home to their developed countries after receiving treatment <b>abroad,</b> <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> is significant to the public health field as it impacts the overall population health in developed countries. Depending on the efficiency, quality and effectiveness of care received by international providers, <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> can aid in improving the health status of those in developed countries, which is, essentially, the overall goal of public health...|$|R

40|$|Globally, <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing {{healthcare}} service sectors. Various hospitals in countries such as Thailand, India, Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico, Switzerland, Poland or Austria, offer complex state of the art surgeries, non-surgical diagnostic and other alternative treatments. When making a decision to <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> for <b>medical</b> treatment, potential <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> consumers use a variety of sources of information to find information about countries and speciality hospitals. Sources range from previous personal experience, through family, friends, to print and television media, personal physician, medical travel agent, health insurance policy provider, <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> advertising campaigns and trade fairs. It is widely acknowledged that there is an enormous amount of health and <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> related information available on the internet. The way medical patients as consumers search, choose, evaluate and appraise information, regarding their choice of country, destination within the country, hospital, doctor and holiday is important, since sources of information about availability of treatment, doctors, hospital accreditation and destination country can influence a consumer’s decision to travel, or not to travel, overseas for treatment to improve their health and well-being. However, the information available is of variable quality. The search cost, time and information search skills of potential medical consumers affect their selection and assessment of information about the treatment, physician, hospital and destination suited to their health and medical related travel purposes. However, there is little empirical research into <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> information search, so the qualitative research of Medhekar and Newby (2012) is drawn upon to provide the foundation for the research study into <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> information search reported in this paper.

40|$|Background Recent trends {{document}} {{growth in}} <b>medical</b> <b>tourism,</b> the private pursuit of <b>medical</b> interventions <b>abroad.</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>tourism</b> introduces challenges to decision-making that impact and are {{impacted by the}} physician-patient trust relationship—a relationship on which the foundation of beneficent health care lies. The objective {{of the study is}} to examine the views of Canadian family physicians about the roles that trust plays in decision-making about <b>medical</b> <b>tourism,</b> and the impact of <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> on the therapeutic relationship. Methods We conducted six focus groups with 22 family physicians in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Data were analyzed thematically using deductive and inductive codes that captured key concepts across the narratives of participants. Results Family physicians indicated that they trust their patients to act as the lead decision-makers about <b>medical</b> <b>tourism,</b> but are conflicted when the information they are managing contradicts {{the best interests of the}} patients. They reported that patients distrust local health care systems when they experience insufficiencies in access to care and that this can prompt patients to consider going abroad for care. Trust fractures in the physician-patient relationship can arise from shame, fear and secrecy about <b>medical</b> <b>tourism.</b> Conclusions Family physicians face diverse tensions about <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> as they must balance their roles in: (1) providing information about <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> within a context of information deficits; (2) supporting decision-making while distancing themselves from patients’ decisions to engage in medical tourism; and (3) acting both as agents of the patient and of the domestic health care system.

40|$|Medical Tourism' - the {{phenomenon}} of people <b>travelling</b> <b>abroad</b> to access <b>medical</b> treatment - has received increasing attention in academic and popular media. This paper reports findings from a study examining effect of inbound and outbound <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> on the UK NHS, by estimating volume of <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> and associated costs and benefits. A mixed methods study it includes analysis of the UK International Passenger Survey (IPS); interviews with 77 returning UK medical tourists, 63 policymakers, NHS managers and <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> industry actors policymakers, and a review of published literature. These informed costing of three types of treatments for which patients commonly travel abroad: fertility treatment, cosmetic and bariatric surgery. Costing of inbound tourism relied on data obtained through 28 Freedom-of-Information requests to NHS Foundation Trusts. Findings demonstrate that contrary to some popular media reports, {{far from being a}} net importer of patients, the UK is now a clear net exporter of medical travellers. In 2010, an estimated 63, 000 UK residents travelled for treatment, while around 52, 000 patients sought treatment in the UK. Inbound medical tourists treated as private patients within NHS facilities may be especially profitable when compared to UK private patients, yielding close to a quarter of revenue from only 7 % of volume in the data examined. Costs arise where patients <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> and return with complications. Analysis also indicates possible savings especially in future health care and social costs averted. These are likely to be specific to procedures and conditions treated. UK <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> is a growing phenomenon that presents risks and opportunities to the NHS. To fully understand its implications and guide policy on issues such as NHS global activities and patient safety will require investment in further research and monitoring.

40|$|<b>Travelling</b> <b>abroad</b> for <b>medical</b> treatment, {{also known}} as {{healthcare}} tourism is a growing phenomenon. <b>Medical</b> <b>tourism</b> is a provision of cost effective private medical care by corporate hospitals such as Apollo, Wockhardt, Sancheti and Fortis, {{in partnership with the}} government, <b>medical</b> and the <b>tourism</b> industry for patients needing elective, diagnostic, cosmetic surgery and alternative therapies. Many patients from developed as well as developing countries of South Asia and Africa are travelling to India for complex medical treatment in search of value for money. In 2009, India was ranked second only to Thailand as a medical destination due to low cost of surgery and number of medical tourists. Individual states such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra in partnership with private corporate sector hospitals are promoting and attracting foreign tourists for highly complex surgical procedures such as hip and knee replacements, cancer treatment, dental, reproductive and organ transplant. Given the privatisation and private finance initiatives during the 1990 Rao-reforms, healthcare provision was opened to corporate sector attracting foreign direct investment. This also led to the adoption of WHO macroeconomic health strategy of investment in health, as a pathway for economic development for developing countries. The Minister of Finance, in the 10 th 2003 - 2007 budget speech called for India to become a world class “Global Health Destination”.

40|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>tourism</b> is {{a global}} {{phenomenon}} and the number one growing niche segment of the tourism industry. It is a sub-set of health tourism. There are many reasons why people travel to another country and become medical tourists; such as high health and insurance costs, long waiting lists, {{and the absence of}} the latest medical procedures and technology in their home countries. In addition, low surgical cost, latest medical technology, no waiting period, internationally accredited medical facilities and qualified staff in Thailand, India, Malaysia, Mexico and Poland make them attractive destinations for medical treatment. Thus, increasing numbers of people are making an informed personal healthcare decision to obtain the best outcome at an affordable price with no waiting period. Multiple regression analysis was used to test the two hypotheses.

40|$|Nowadays, health {{services}} trade (otherwise called <b>medical</b> <b>tourism)</b> {{is becoming more}} and more popular (20 % annual growth worldwide). Due to that, competition in the field is also increasing; thus, in order to stay competitive, one must understand medical tourists’ behaviour and act accordingly. With this in mind, the purpose of the research is to investigate consumer behaviour in <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> and analyse health service exports’ attractiveness in Lithuania. By using a case study of a local <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> facilitator Wellness Travels, the research investigates what changes would improve Wellness Travels’ attractiveness to their customers and competitive position in the market. A well-balanced empirical research is made, including an analysis of previous literature, semi-structured interviews with <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> stakeholders, secondary data from the field and a quantitative survey to (potential) medical tourists. All this is summarised through the 4 P Analysis and the Theory of Planned Behaviour to bring practical conclusions that can be implemented by Wellness Travels within their international strategy. Results show that lower price, shorter waiting time and higher quality of medical treatment positively influence medical tourists’ satisfaction. At the same time, perceived behavioural control, attitudes and subjective norms towards Wellness Travels positively influence medical tourists’ behavioural intention to choose the company’s services. Furthermore, those who are younger, earning less, are living not in their home country or have been on a <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> trip before have a higher intention of going <b>abroad</b> for a <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> trip. Such consumer behaviour insights help the company to create a well-balanced marketing mix strategy designed to increase their competitiveness. At the same time, a theoretical basis for further research on the topic is put by proving that the Theory of Planned Behaviour can be well used to understand consumer behaviour in the <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> industry...|$|R

The introductory section of the paper provides a background to the <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> industry. Section two puts forward a brief literature review on <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> and identifies and develops a list of nine (9) different types/categories of wellness and medical tourist. Section three highlights and critically examines the government policy initiatives to support the sustainable development and growth of <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> industry in the three countries. Section four provides discussion and policy implications and lessons for India and Australia. Conclusion section includes recommendation and future research directions...|$|R
5|$|Many of the {{hospitals}} in Enugu are privately run. The UNTH and the National Orthopaedic Hospital are {{among some of}} the government controlled hospitals in the city. The medical equipment for the UNTH was upgraded in 2009 as well as parts of the hospital which were renovated in the same year. Most hospitals in the city suffer from a poor standard of medical facilities available to them; many of the city's citizens <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> for <b>medical</b> care. However, hospitals have been aided by foreign organisations and by Enugu's community at home and abroad who have donated medicine and other medical equipment. The most developed government hospital in Enugu is the Park Lane Hospital. The governor has said that the state has bought some ambulance service vehicles in March 2010. Enugu State has established free medical care for pregnant women and for all children under 5 years of age in the state. The child healthcare programme, founded under the District Health System (DHS), was added to the states 2008 budget. Enugu State has a HIV/AIDS prevalence of 6.5%, one of the highest in the country.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Medical</b> <b>tourism</b> is {{a global}} health {{practice}} where patients <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> to receive health care. Voluntourism is a practice where physicians <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> to deliver health care. Both of these practices often entail travel from high income to low and middle income countries and both {{have been associated with}} possible negative impacts. In this paper, we explore the social responsibilities of medical tourists and voluntourists to identify commonalities and distinctions {{that can be used to}} develop a wider understanding of social responsibility in global health care practices. Discussion Social responsibility is a responsibility to promote the welfare of the communities to which one belongs or with which one interacts. Physicians stress their social responsibility to care for the welfare of their patients and their domestic communities. When physicians choose to travel to another county to provide medical care, this social responsibility is expanded to this new community. Patients too have a social responsibility to use their community's health resources efficiently and to promote the health of their community. When these patients choose to go <b>abroad</b> to receive <b>medical</b> care, this social responsibility applies to the new community as well. While voluntourists and medical tourists both see the scope of their social responsibilities expand by engaging in these global practices, the social responsibilities of physician voluntourists are much better defined than those of medical tourists. Guidelines for engaging in ethical voluntourism and training for voluntourists still need better development, but <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> as a practice should follow the lead of voluntourism by developing clearer norms for ethical <b>medical</b> <b>tourism.</b> Summary Much can be learned by examining the social responsibilities of medical tourists and voluntourists when they engage in global health practices. While each group needs better guidance for engaging in responsible forms of these practices, patients are at a disadvantage in understanding the effects of <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> and organizing responses to these impacts. Members of the medical professions and the <b>medical</b> <b>tourism</b> industry must take responsibility for providing better guidance for medical tourists. </p...|$|R
