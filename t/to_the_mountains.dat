5|$|Some {{legends of}} the Kami and Cahuilla tribes {{probably}} refer to Lake Cahuilla.

5|$|A barrier jet in the {{low levels}} forms just {{upstream}} of mountain chains, with the mountains forcing the jet to be oriented parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains.</b> The mountain barrier increases {{the strength of the}} low level wind by 45 percent. In the North American Great Plains a southerly low-level jet helps fuel overnight thunderstorm activity during the warm season, normally in the form of mesoscale convective systems which form during the overnight hours. A similar phenomenon develops across Australia, which pulls moisture poleward from the Coral Sea towards cut-off lows which form mainly across southwestern portions of the continent.|$|E
5|$|Anna ventures {{out to find}} Elsa and end the winter, leaving Hans in charge. She gets lost, {{collecting}} supplies at Wandering Oaken's shop.

On foot, they meet Olaf, a cheerful snowman brought to life unknowingly by Elsa, who offers to lead them to her. When Anna’s horse returns to Arendelle, Hans sets out to find Anna and Elsa, accompanied by the Duke's minions, who have secret orders to capture Elsa.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Saxon immigration, the Székelys –Hungarian-speaking free warriors {{cultivating}} communal lands– were transferred to the southeast of the province. From the 13thcentury they were governed independently from the voivode by a royal official, the count of the Székelys. Besides the Saxons, the Cistercians became the agents of expansion in Transylvania. When their abbey at Cârţa was established in the early 13thcentury, Andrew II ordered that the strip of land running up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> between the rivers Olt, Cârţişoara and Arpaş be transferred from the Romanians to the new monastery.|$|E

Chapter 24 begins, which describes Njörðr {{as the father of}} two beautiful and powerful children: Freyr and Freyja. In chapter 37, after Freyr has spotted the beautiful jötunn Gerðr, he becomes overcome with sorrow, and refuses to sleep, drink, or talk. Njörðr then sends for Skírnir to find out who he seems to be so angry at, and, not looking forward to being treated roughly, Skírnir reluctantly goes to Freyr.|$|E
5|$|Manitoba is at {{the centre}} of the Hudson Bay {{drainage}} basin, with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. This basin's rivers reach far west <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains,</b> far south into the United States, and east into Ontario. Major watercourses include the Red, Assiniboine, Nelson, Winnipeg, Hayes, Whiteshell and Churchill rivers. Most of Manitoba's inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz. This region, particularly the Red River Valley, is flat and fertile; receding glaciers left hilly and rocky areas throughout the province.|$|E

The sole survivor is a man named Babcock, who reveals that he has saved the alien corpse from theft by burying it. Together, the three men bring the corpse to the United States. There, Mulder and Arlinsky perform an autopsy on the corpse, believing it belongs to a genuine extraterrestrial. After Mulder leaves to meet with Scully, a mysterious assassin, Scott Ostelhoff, arrives and kills Arlinsky.|$|E
5|$|On 7 December 1975, Indonesian forces invaded East Timor. Operasi Seroja (Operation Lotus) was {{the largest}} {{military}} operation ever carried out by that nation. Troops from Fretilin's military organisation Falintil engaged ABRI forces {{in the streets of}} Dili, and reported 400 Indonesian paratroopers were killed as they descended into the city. Angkasa Magazine reports 35 dead Indonesian troops, and 122 from the Fretilin side. By the end of the year, 10,000 troops occupied Dili and another 20,000 had been deployed throughout East Timor. Massively outnumbered, Falintil troops fled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> and continued guerrilla combat operations.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{have shown}} how {{important}} birds are to individual societies, touching on {{all aspects of}} life. In Andean societies such as the Moche (1–800 AD), Nazca (100–700 AD) and Chimu (1150–1450 AD), bright parrot and macaw feathers were traded from the Amazon rainforest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> and the Pacific coast, while guano was collected as a fertiliser, and artists and craftsmen were inspired to create textiles, metal jewellery, and ceramics depicting condors, cormorants, ducks, hummingbirds, owls, vultures, and waders. Their religions, too, endowed birds with symbolic meaning.|$|E
5|$|The Daniels {{family moved}} to Indiana from Pennsylvania in 1959 when his father {{accepted}} {{a job at the}} Indianapolis headquarters of the pharmaceutical company Pittman-Moore. Then 11-year-old Daniels was accustomed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains,</b> and he at first disliked the flatland of central Indiana. He was still in grade school {{at the time of the}} move and first attended Delaware Trail Elementary, Westlane Junior High School, and North Central High School. In high school he was student body president. After graduation in 1967, Daniels was named one of Indiana's Presidential Scholars—the state's top male high school graduate that year—by President Lyndon B. Johnson.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Mérens is closely linked to its {{homeland}} in the Pyrenees, {{as evidenced by the}} many myths and legends in which it plays a role. The origins of the Mérens are very old, and are commonly said to be lost in the mists of time. It is native to the upper valley of Ariege, near Andorra. The direct ancestor of the Mérens was probably in this valley during the Quaternary Period, approximately 15,000 years ago. These wild horses probably moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> to escape global warming that accompanied {{the end of the last}} glacial period.|$|E

On the night of May 22–23, 1981, several hundred people came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> after Richard Glenn claimed to have been warned of UFO visits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> that night. <b>The</b> observations were severely limited by a rainstorm, although some alleged sightings still took place.
