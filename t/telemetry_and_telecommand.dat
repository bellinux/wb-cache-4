40|$|The European Retrieval Carrier (EURECA) was {{launched}} {{on its first}} flight on the 31 st of July 1992 and retrieved on the 29 th of June 1993. EURECA is characterized by several new on-board features, most notably Packet <b>telemetry,</b> <b>and</b> a partial implementation of packet telecommanding, the first ESA packetised spacecraft. Today {{more than one year}} after the retrieval the data from the EURECA mission has to a large extent been analysed and we can present some of the interesting results. This paper concentrates on the implementation and operational experience with the EURECA Packet <b>Telemetry</b> <b>and</b> Packet <b>Telecommanding.</b> We already discovered during the design of the ground system that the use of packet telemetry has major impact on the overall design and that processing of packet telemetry may have significant effect on the computer loading and sizing. During the mission a number of problems were identified with the on-board implementation resulting in very strange anomalous behaviors. Many of these problems directly violated basic assumptions for the design of the ground segment adding to the strange behavior. The paper shows that the design of a telemetry packet system should be flexible enough to allow a rapid configuration of the telemetry processing in order to adapt it to the new situation in case of an on-board failure. The experience gained with the EURECA mission control should be used to improve ground systems for future missions...|$|R
40|$|The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) is a {{joint mission}} between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR e. V.). Principle Investigator is the University of Texas Center for Space Research (UTCSR). Responsibility for {{operational}} activities, like satellite safety, <b>telemetry</b> <b>and</b> <b>telecommanding,</b> maneuver planning <b>and</b> execution and formation keeping, belongs to the German Space Operations Center (GSOC), where this work was conducted during the first phases of the mission (LEOP). The twin GRACE satellites were launched on-board the Eurockot Rockot launcher on March 17, 2002, form Plesetsk, Russia. The current mission phase is the transition from commissioning into the science validation phase. GRACE mission goals include the generation of models for the time-variable gravity field of the Earth, to produce a long-term mean estimate of the Earth´s gravity field and to provide radio occulation profiles over the predicted five-year lifetime of the mission. From a scientific point of view, GRACE improves, upon the conventional methods, the gravity field determination by using differential, range-change measurements between twin, co-orbiting satellites and improved accelerometers. This formation-flying scenario ensures global, homogenious and high accuracy gravity measurements. The fundamental requirement for normal science activities of each satellite is to point at the predicted position of the other satellite, keeping the bore sight of the microwave link within a dead band as small as +- 0, 5 mrad (pitch and yaw) and +- 10 mrad in roll. The AOCS incorporates a trajectory generation algorithm, taking inputs from an on board SGP 4 (Simplified General Perturbations) orbit propagator, such that the relative position between the two satellites is computed to be within 50 m. This work was motivated by the necessity of verifying the correct behavior of the satellite during science operations and the attempt to improve AOCS pointing performance, especially after {{the failure of the}} inertial measurement unit on GRACE- 1, resulting in a higher gas consumption and and more thruster activations. The pointing performance of investigated by the implementation of a reference/target attitude using as inputs GPS position <b>and</b> velocity <b>telemetry</b> data (WGS- 84 frame), earth rotation service (IERS) parameters for a conversion to J 2000 inertial frame, SGP 4 /Two Line Element (TLE) propagation (J 2000 frame) and TLE records generated by the GSOC flight dynamics group. The current inertial attitude is delivered by on-board star tracker measurements. Furthermore the correlation between the attitude behavior and the mission environment (I. e. orbital position) is analyzed by the assesment of a GRACE science mode simulator including main disturbance torques (gravity gradient, aerodynamic drag, solar pressure and magnetic field) and validated using space telemetry data. The paper presents a description of the developed Matlab/Simulink model and the results of these investigations using latest GRACE space data...|$|R

Consequently, GSOC had to upgrade its multi-mission control center facilities in order to include the required new functionality. Due to the fact that, for many of its missions, GSOC requires cross support from other agencies, the existing capabilities particularly those relating to external ground stations interfaces had to be retained and in some cases expanded. The new Packet Telecommand Standard had a major impact on the GSOC telecommand System architecture, the "Frame Operations Procedure" (FOP) of the "Command Operations Procedure" (COP- 1) protocol had to be integrated into the existing system. This was primarily to ensure that ESA standard compliance was retaind within the GSOC control center itselfs and also to provide independence from the many ground stations integrated into the support network.
