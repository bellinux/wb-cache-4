500|$|In January 2001, a United States {{federal appeals}} court upheld the {{dismissal}} of the Church of Scientology International's case against Time Warner. In its opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that Time Warner had not published [...] "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power" [...] with an actual intent of malice, a standard that must be met for libel cases involving individuals and public groups. On October 1, 2001, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to consider reinstating the church's libel case Church of Scientology International v. <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> <b>Inc.,</b> 00-1683. Time Warner said it refused to be [...] "intimidated by the church's apparently limitless legal resources." [...] In arguments presented to the Supreme Court, the Church of Scientology acknowledged that church officials had [...] "committed improper acts" [...] in the past, but also claimed that: [...] "allegations of past misconduct were false and distorted, {{the result of the}} misunderstanding, suspicion and prejudice that typically greet a new religion". Of the rulings for Time Warner, the Church of Scientology complained that they [...] "provide a safe harbor for biased journalism". Behar commented on the Church of Scientology's legal defeat, and said that the lawsuit had a chilling effect: [...] "It's a tremendous defeat for Scientology... But of course their doctrine states that the purpose of a suit is to harass, not to win, so from that perspective they hurt us all. They've had a real chilling effect on journalism, both before and after my piece".|$|E
